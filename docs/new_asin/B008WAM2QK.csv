5186962,1,B008WAM2QK,A very short 60 minute documentary with most of the material just old clips from previous WWE home video releases. Unless you just want this set for the matches it's not worth it. Very poor job by WWE on this one.,1352332800,,213,4.219512195121951
5186963,1,B008WAM2QK,"Way to go Vince...first you kill off WWE CLASSIC ON DEMAND (aka WWE 24/7) after I fought so hard to get my local provider (ATT) to carry it, IN LIEU of trying to launch a 24hr WWE NETWORK ala Oprah Winfrey...EPIC FAIL.  Now all that's left of that deal is a lame WWE Youtube channel that's NO LONGER GENERATING A REVENUE STREAM FOR WWE by catering to Old School Fans like myself(who were more than willing to pay the $8.00 a month Subscription Fee to be able to RELIVE & REWIND the memories at our convenience ON DEMAND)...SO WHAT TO DO?  OH I DON'T KNOW...WHY NOT KILL OFF one of WWEs SOUL REMAINING REVENUE STREAMS...WWE HOME VIDEO.  Don't know if you've checked your PPV buy rates lately Vinnie Mac...or your TV ratings...but nobody's watchin! HINT: That's why your WWE Network idea couldn't get off the ground. :)

Anyways ENTER the NWO:REVOLUTION DVD/BLU-RAY release.  As I've indicated I'm a huge Old School WCW/nWo and (for those old enough) NWA Jim Crockett mark.  The first WWE DVD I ever purchased was the original nWo Single Disc ""Back in Black"" release that's long been out of print...tho it was only a single 3 hr DVD...it was SUPERBLY put together and left me hankerin' for more WWE WCW Home Video DVD releases! The last one I picked up prior to this release was THE VERY BEST OF WCW MONDAY NITRO also a STELLAR production from START to FINISH...which brings me to this piece of crap that I picked up today (November 5, 2012) upon its release.  First let me say that EVERYWHERE I went the shelves were SOLD OUT or should I say SOULED OUT (which speaks to the legacy of the nWo angle in Professional Wrestling History) but I finally found a local store that had both the DVD & BLU-RAY Edition.  I picked up both for my wrestling library as well as 2 additional Blu-Rays to give as gifts to fellow nWoites for Christmas this year! Welp...after previewing the 3 DVD Set, I will be returning ALL of the Blu-Rays to the store tomorrow as I haven't opened them yet (and can get a full refund of the purchase price)...Yep, thats how SHITTY this release IS.

I HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES...WHERE TO BEGIN.  First as other reviewers have mentioned the Documentary absolutely SUCKS and appears to have been hap-hazzardly mish-moshed together by some jobber that's NOT a fan of the business and shoulda kept his day job.  THEN THERE'S THE WEIRD PICTURE CROPPING thing that's going on all the time.  During ALL of the action (i.e. wrestling) the picture seems to have been cropped from its original 4:3 broadcast presentation on the left & right sides then stretched VERTICALLY to fit the screen resulting in video that would be better suited for viewing on a phone or iPad rather than a 16x9 Widescreen TV...or a regular 4:3 TV for that matter...At first I thought that it might be incorrect settings on either my TV or my player, but nope it seems some idiot at either WWE Headquarters in Connecticut or a bigshot in the media industry intentionally CROPPED it this way!!!! WHY, I'LL NEVER KNOW.  To SEE this effect ALL one has to do is watch the documentary and keep your eye on the WWE scratch logo which appears in the bottom left corner of the picture during the CROPPED action then suddenly in the MIDDLE of the FRICKIN' FRAME when someone is being interviewed (which conveniently changes to a WIDE 16X9 full frame shot!) WWE why did you decide to go to market with this presentation??  We the fans REALIZE that the original footage wasn't shot in Hi-DEF 16x9 format and aren't expecting it to FILL up our HUGE 16x9 televisions like it did as originally broadcast...BUT GOD ALMIGHTY...we would of HAD MORE PICTURE IF you had left the original footage ALONE...Instead we're left with this weird LSD trip of a presentation that switches back 'n' forth but STILL doesn't fill up the screen and provides us with LESS picture!!!  What red-headed stepchild came up with this scheme?? SCHEME-GENE??  As fans we've TOLERATED everything from the BLURRING of turnbuckles with the WWE World Wildlife Fund logo on them which in turn sometimes pixelated or blurred the wrestling action to BLURRED fan signs in prior Home Video releases over the years, but THIS cropping of the original 4:3 broadcast picture takes the cake!

All I know is that I WAS excited about the prospects of WWE FINALLY making the jump to Blu-RAY...so much so that I purchased multiple copies of both the DVD & the Blu-RAY versions of this release...BUT SADLY THIS WILL BE MY LAST WWE HOME VIDEO PURCHASE!!! How many more REVENUE STREAMS can WWE kill off before they go the way of WCW?? Well I guess they still have the toys...lets see how long before they kill that one as well...Their so-called Brawlin' Buddies (which was a cool concept in both the 80s & 90s) was brought back this year in time for Christmas, but are so damned small they must be designed for newborn infants to wrestle...HELLO WWE is anyone awake at the wheel over there in Connecticut??

I strongly suggest that if you're a fan of the nWo/WCW Monday Night Wars era that you pick up the VERY BEST OF MONDAY NITRO 3 Disc DVD Set as it is much better than this piece of CRAP thats been foisted on us...Sadly that set was produced a year before WWE made the jump to Blu-Ray, but at least it is presented in its uncropped FULL FRAME 4:3 original broadcast presentation minus the WWE HD tag Jimmy Jack Jericho of an LSD ACID TRIP lol! :)

UPDATE: I had a chance to re-review the video on this set over the 3 day weekend and after receiving several heads up from other viewers discovered that there INDEED WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE VIDEO SETTINGS ON MY PLAYER THAT CAUSED THE VIDEO CROPPING-FRAMING ISSUES noted in this review (for some reason my player had a PAN & SCAN setting as well as 16X9 & 4:3 settings) AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO RE-ASSURE WRESTLING FANS EVERYWHERE THAT THE VIDEO IN THIS SET IS INDEED PRISTINE AND UNADULTERATED!!!!

THAT BEING SAID I HAVE INCREASED MY RATING FROM 1 TO 3 STARS...The reason I didn't raise it to 4 or 5 stars is due to the fact that the sticker on this 3 DVD Set (or alternatively the 2 Disc Blu-Ray Set) indicated that this was a COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE nWo!!! Far from it...Without a doubt it is a BEST OF release to this date (and excusable if this is JUST Volume 1 of more to come from WWE like the Best of Nitro Set) but I personally FEEL that this should've been a 4 DVD (3 Disc Blu-Ray) Set like the Stone Cold Steve Austin release...The 4th DVD (3rd Blu-Ray) could've contained ALL of the PAID FOR BY THE nWo Announcement Vignettes as well as ALL of the nWo Saturday Night matches (which were truly revolutionary & highly entertaining) as well as some of the previously released material such as the 96 Wargames match, the nWo Horsemen skit etc. Also mysteriously absent is the infamous FINGERPOKE OF DOOM match between Kevin Nash & Hulk Hogan which was one of the BIGGEST SWERVES in pro-wrestling history...almost as big as Hulks original heel turn to form the nWo IMHO...that lead to the reformation of the original faction following all the RED/Black & WHITE/Black divisions and watering down of the original angle...Plus woulda loved to see Goldberg get beaten down, tasered and tagged...funny stuff.

WWE IF YOU'RE READING THIS...this is the hottest selling set to date and you shoulda made this a 4DVD/3Blu-Ray disc set like the Stone Cold Steve Austin Set to make it a truly COMPLETE SET...Hopefully you will re-consider and make a VOLUME 2 like the upcoming BEST OF NITRO release to FILL IN THE GAPS...AND  ALSO COMPLETELY RE-DO the nWo DOCUMENTARY on future set (by paying to hear from Eric Bischoff, HOGAN/HALL/NASH...heck even Nick Patrick the nWo referee rather than WCW flunkies like Billy Kidman that were there when the angle transpired but NOT actually a part of the FACTION itself...) cuz the documentary absolutely sucks in light of some of your other ecent releases...Especially in consideration of the MAGNITUDE of the ANGLE...Heck it ALMOST put you guys & Vince outta business :)",1352246400,2,7972,4.627034677990092
5186964,3,B008WAM2QK,"I just got done watching the NWO dvd set and I have to say the documentary really was not that great.  Of course there was a lot of archived footage from Scott Hall and Hulk Hogan and even Vince McMahon.  There were some new interviews with Dusty Rhodes, Matt Striker,  Cody Rhodes, Kevin Nash, Vince Russo (surpise) and even Lex Luger (also a big suprise).  I wish they could have gotten Sting (of course I knew this was a long shot but was hoping) and also Eric Bischoff (again a long shot).  The documentary just felt rushed, clocking in at only 63 minutes.  Most of the documentaries now run at least an hour and a half so I had a problem with that.  Another thing that was never showed was that Eric Bischoff actually stole the idea of the NWO from New Japan.  They had done the same storyline of a bunch of wrestlers from within the company invading the company.  There wasn't a whole lot of new information told except some of Kevin Nash's comments and also Sean Waltman's as well.  Most of what they talked about was very short and sweet almost like little blurbs so honestly, the documentary sucks.  The matches though was even better.

The first match was the Bash at the Beach match that started everything.  Kevin Nash and Scott Hall came into the event to take on Sting, Lex Luger and Randy Savage.  They had promised for weeks that they had a third man but it wasn't until the end of the match where we find out that that third man was Hulk Hogan.  I remeber watching when I was a teenager and not really believing my eyes.  I hadn't seen Hogan as a bad guy since the early 80's so it was nice to see him turn heel.

The next match was the Hog Wild 1996 match with Hogan taking on Giant (Big Show) for the WCW world title.  I actually hate this match because after every move the Giant does, Hogan rolls out of the ring so the match gets boring really fast.  I think we all knew that Hogan was going to win but I just wished that they could have made it more exciting.

Next we see Hall and Nash take on Harlem Heat at Halloween Havoc 1996 for the tag titles.  This was a good match.  Of course it was another match that didn't suprise us.  The NWO was gaining a lot of momentum at this time so it was only natural that the Outsiders would win the tag titles to go with the world title they had.

The next match was Syxx taking on Bounty Hunter on NWO Saturday night.  This was just a standard match, nothing really cool here.  Kind of a waste of space.

Up next was the Outsiders taking on the Steiners for the tag titles at Souled out 1997.  I like this one.  I know from the documentary that Kevin Nash hated this PPV but I actually like the PPV and thought it was pretty innovative for its time.  The match itself was a lot of back and forth action and just really rocked.  I liked this one.

The next match was a Starrcade 1996 rematch between Hulk Hogan and Roddy Piper at Superbrawl VII in 1997 for the world title.  I remember the whole buildup for this one was just laughable.  I remember the match took place in San Francisco and they tried to say that Piper prepared for the match by staying in Alcatraz.  Really?  So what!  It's not like there was anyone there to challenge him to fights.  It was abandoned!  However, the match itself was good.  I don't think it was as good as Starrcade but it was still good.

The next match was Hulk Hogan and NBA star Dennis Rodman taking on Lex Luger and Giant from Bash at the Beach 1997.  This match was very good.  I was actually suprised at how well Rodman worked in the ring.  I remember the media coverage that this match got and I think it helped to make the match even better then it would have been.

The next match was a Sudden Death match between Randy Savage and DDP.  I remember these two had a great feud in 1997 and this was the match I was really looking forward to.  I loved it from start to finish.  This was a great feud and this match was one of the best matches they had in the series between them two.  The one thing I was suprised about was the fact that not a lot of ""plunder"" was used in the match but it was still worth seeing.

Up next was the Starrcade 1997 rematch between Sting and Hulk Hogan for the World title.  I remember watching Nitro the night this happened and I remembered that the match never ended cause they said they ran out of time so it was nice that the WWE included the ending to the match after Nitro went off the air.  Good match and worth seeing.

Up next is a WCW world title match between Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan from Nitro in 1998.  This match actually took place the night after Spring Stampede when Savage beat Sting for the title.  I was expecting a fairly nice title reign for Savage but I guess Hogan pulled some strings to ensure that he would win the belt.  It was a good match but a really messed up ending.

The next match is for control of the WCW tag titles between Sting and The Giant at Great American Bash 1998.  This match was short but it was actually a good match.  Sting wins and because of the win he got to hold both of the tag titles and choose his tag partner.  That was kind of confusing but the match was good.

The next match was DDP and Jay Leno taking on Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff at Road Wild 1998.  Honestly, this match is really good.  Leno I thought was really good.  He really suprised me as a good worker.  I think the fans were into it hardcore and the media was courious about how well or not Leno would do and honestly, I don't think it disappointed.

Up next was the War Games match from Fall Brawl 1998.  This was a weak match.  I hated the rules to it.  There were three teams:  NWO Wolfpac, NWO black and white and WCW.  There were teams but it was also every man for himself because whoever won got a world title shot at Halloween Havoc.  The match itself just wasn't that great but there were some cool people involved like Bret Hart, DDP, Hulk Hogan, Warrior, Lex Luger, Sting and many others.  I wish they would have chosen another match over this one.

The next match was the Starrcade 1998 world title match between Kevin Nash and Goldberg.  This match has been released many times and I think needs to be retired.  It's good but it's not that good that it needs to be released so many times.

Up next is Bret Hart taking on Goldberg for the vacant world title on Nitro in 1999.  This match was just an ok match.  The ending was just too busy and poorly booked but it was still pretty good.

Lastly, we get the handicapped match from Raw with Hall, Nash and Hogan taking on Rock and Steve Austin.  This was like a dream match but the action wasn't that great.  Sadly, this will probably the only time we will ever get a chance to see Austin and Hogan in the ring wrestling.  The match was just ok.

So all in all, the DVD was pretty good.  The documentary was pretty dull because there was really nothing new to add to what we already know.  The match selection was good but could have been better.  Some matches I wish they would have included was:  Hogan against Savage from Halloween Havoc 1996, the elminiation match from Uncensored 1997, the War Games match from Fall Brawl 1997 and the tag team bat mach from Spring Stampede 1998.  There are so many others but I can't remember them all at this time.  They also maybe could have included another disc of infamous interviews and moments from the NWO.  That would have been cool to see that.

So, in closing, I was a little disappointed in the DVD but the matches were worth the purchase.  Hopefully WWE will do better with their next documentary set.",1352160000,10,7575,4.236529041287613
5186965,5,B008WAM2QK,"I watched the ""Back in Black"" video and then I watched this video and it's much better by far. While ""Back in Black is very incomplete this set is just the opposite. Although the documentary is only 63 minutes long it doesn't take any shortcuts and chronicles the nWo very well. While ""Back in Black"" focused only on Hogan, Hall, and Nash, this set focused a lot more, a lot lot lot more on the people that would join the nWo throughout it's period of popularity. It talks about it's rise, mainstream media, celebrity involvement, how Souled Out was the stupidest ppv concept ever, Wolf-Pac starting the demise of the group, and it's short shell of a run in WWE

Good Things:
Hear a lot from Cody Rhodes, Matt Striker, Dusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Kevin Nash, DDP
Seeing Lex Luger and Vince Russo in a WWE documentary
the WWF logo showing loud and proud again
The end showing the WWE Home video logo, then changing it to nWo Home Video

Bad Thungs:
Recycled interviews from Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Eric Bischoff
Lots of the same stories being re-told
Another re-telling of Wrestlamania X8",1352160000,4,1087,4.626943005181347
5186966,5,B008WAM2QK,"nWo: The Revolution didn't hold back any punches as it contained a pretty good historical and factual documentary which was highly entertaining.  The documentary consisted of brand new interviews with Kevin Nash, Booker T and some of the WCW talent that were present at the time.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a few new interview clips of Vince Russo and Lex Luger inserted as well, good to get some new faces that were around during that time.  It also used previous interviews from Eric Bischoff, Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall and Vince McMahon, which served its purpose with the documentary.

There were tons of extras for any nWo or wrestling fan from that time.  I really enjoyed the Round table discussion on the nWo from WWE Classics which is a blu ray only feature.  I would highly recommend this to any fan of the Monday night war era or new ones that wants some history lesson.  Hope, everyone enjoys it.",1352160000,,912,4.6625
5186967,3,B008WAM2QK,"WWE has really hit some home runs in the last two years with their home video line-up, producing stellar releases such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Greatest-Rivalries-Shawn-Michaels-vs-Bret-Hart-Blu-ray/dp/B005BYBZBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Greatest Rivalries - Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stone-Cold-Steve-Austin-The-Bottom-Line-on-the-Most-Popular-Superstar-of-All-Time-Blu-ray/dp/B005G7WGQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line on the Most Popular Superstar of All Time [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-CM-Punk-Best-in-the-World-Blu-ray/dp/B008IG0E7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: CM Punk - Best in the World [Blu-ray</a>]. What made these releases so great is that the documentary and/or interview portions in them provided the viewer with detailed information on what was taking place behind the scenes in professional wrestling. Unfortunately, nWo: the revolution fears to tread into this territory, which is a shame because I was reading the Pro Wrestling Torch during the entire monday night war era and this documentary didn't come close to scratching the surface of all the real life drama that took place during the original run of the nWo. The documentary here mainly stays kayfabe, and tells the storyline story of the nWo. Don't get me wrong, I understand and appreciate that they do this, but it needs to be balanced with some insider details, in my opinion, to really provide the viewer with the complete story surrounding the nWo's rise and fall. For example, they got Lex Luger, Sean Waltman and Vince Russo to shoot new interviews for this release... and they didn't dish at all! Not one controversial story, not one insider scoop... none! And these were guys that were involved in some pretty major parts of the nWo! If I remember correctly, they only used one interview clip from Russo... one?! Why even interview the guy? During the documentary they only vaguely discussed how Hall and Nash came to jump to WCW (Nash provides more info in the Blu-ray extras... read on). They didn't tell the story of how Jerry Saggs became enraged with Scott Hall and legitimately attacked him in the ring leading to a huge blow up and standoff back stage. No mention of how Kevin Nash takes a lot of heat for WCW's demise when he became booker and booked himself to defeat Goldberg (they only give a nod to this to all the smart fans during the documentary). No real life details at all. However, and this is why it's important to purchase the Blu-ray edition of this title, fortunately as a Blu-ray exclusive WWE has included the complete Legends of Wrestling roundtable discussion on the nWo. Kevin Nash is a guest on that panel and he gives more insider information and background on the formation, rise and fall of the nWo than you'll find in this entire documentary. So, if you're looking for the goods, you'll find them during that roundtable discussion. Nash is open and forthright about what was done right and wrong in WCW at the time, he even openly discusses his motivation for booking himself to end Goldberg's streak and explains why the ""finger poke of doom"" was done and how it was part of a much larger plan that quickly fell apart, and why! Great stuff, the roundtable discussion is worth the price of this Blu-ray alone, don't miss it. After that, the matches are a nice bonus, but I already have the best moments and matches on other sets.

Bottom line, if you were an nWo fan, this is a must buy for the Legends of Wrestling roundtable discussion and because it collects almost all of the best moments from the entire angle in one set. However, if you were hoping for an inside look on one of professional wrestling's greatest money making angles during the documentary portion, then you may be disappointed to find a kayfabe presentation instead.",1352160000,8,4023,5.552117263843648
5186968,1,B008WAM2QK,"Just give us the matches/programs and spare us the biased spin. Eventually, after Vince McMahon is out of the picture, they'll begin making the old programming available - not just WCW but all the other archives and promotions he's swallowed up and buried in the ""Vince vault"". On a more positive note nice to see these old matches even in agenda slanted selections and at least this set doesn't just skip an entire year or two like the last one! Just kidding - it does.",1351987200,,470,4.541176470588235

5187012,3,B008WAM2QK,"The documentary is only a little over an hour long which is disappointing considering this group was so influential during one of the most important periods of pro wrestling history. In the documentary you got guys such as Kidman, Cody Rhodes, and Hugh Morris getting major screen time which is kind of odd considering they weren't directly part of the N.W.O. at any time. Overall the documentary felt flat and ""safe"", like it was made for a viewer who didn't know anything about this historic angle.

All the rest of the matches/segments/interviews were pretty good and I am glad that the letters ""WWF"" do not need to be cut out for this Blu-ray set. It is kind of funny though to see Micheal Buffer on-screen doing the introductions but his audio is completely cut out. Overall good set when it comes to the matches and other content but a most sub-par documentary.",1439683200,,867,4.703947368421052

5187077,4,B008WAM2QK,I have personally been waiting for an NWO collection for along time and now we have one. I set the bar very high for my favorite faction of all time and that's why I'm only giving this 4 out of 5 stars. First off I think it is a must buy for any wrestling fan. The documentary was pretty good(think back in black was better). The extras are what got me. The extras were good but could've been way better than what it was. Some good matches some bad. All in all it is as I said a must buy for any wrestling fan.,1394323200,,510,3.9134615384615383

5187079,3,B008WAM2QK,"I was disappointed with the documentary on the dvd. It ran too short and they didn't interview the right people. Hall was in no shape for an interview at this time. Eric and Hulk were in TNA so we couldn't hear from them. We heard from Nash and Waltman but I think it would be better instead of interviewing guys like Booker T, Billy Kidman and Bill Demott they seek out more people who were in the NWO like Steiner, Bagwell, Konnan, Scot Norten and Vincent. I think they would know more about the NWO having been in the group. The matches on the dvd make up for the poor documentary. We get a rare Piper vs Hulk from Superbrawl, Savage vs Hulk from Nitro, Sting vs Hulk on Nitro and DDP vs Savage from Halloween Havoc 97. These are some great lost classics and some of the ones that should be on the previous NWO dvd Back in Black. I guess in the end it must have been difficult to do the documentary missing three major players from the NWO but it could have run a lot longer to get more a history of the NWO. I recommend this to NWO fans and new wrestling fans. The matches are great just know what you are getting into with the documentary. Cheers and enjoy!",1393027200,,1162,4.191964285714286

5187137,2,B008WAM2QK,"Ahh, the nWo. A wrestling faction that could have been phenomenal had it had the ingenuity behind it of Vince McMahon. What started off as a brilliant idea for WCW ratings when Scot Hall's contract with WWF expired, and he showed up on WCW the very next night; A week later Kevin Nash showed up, and eventually a match was planned where they had a mystery 3rd man that turned out to be Hulk Hogan. It looked like Vince McMahon had sent these 3 from the WWF to destroy WCW from the inside. The New World Order was born. A faction that could have been something big, something as big and legendary as say, oh, D-Generation X? But instead became a faction that sold a lot of t-shirts then disbanded because they pretty much came out every week recruiting new members and forgot to actually do some wrestling.

It started off as just guys who used to be in the WWF, so it looked like a corporate takeover by WWF was taking place, an invasion if you like, great idea, seeing as how WCW had pretty much hired everyone that was washed up with the WWF anyway. But soon it became apparent that was pretty much all these guys did, recruited others to be part of the nWo. It was a big gang of members and they would bully and beat up guys who where against them. It seemed new at the time, somewhat cool, and refreshing for a while, and even revamped ole' Hulk Hogans career now as a bad dude, brotha. But then they just split into two sides, recruited everyone around them some more, until there was hardly a WCW wrestler left to recruit. So what do you do next? They recruit b-name celebrities and had stupid matches like Jay Leno vs Hulk Hogan, and Karl Malone vs Dennis Rodman. Sigh. Is it any wonder this was the start of the downfall of WCW?

By the end there was so much confusion on who was with which nWo or another faction with a similar stupid name and shirt, that eventually it crashed into a wall and the nWo was put on life support. WCW tried to revive itself again in the early 2000's, only no one could see anything to do with Jeff Jarret as a champion of anything but tag teaming would ever work out. Once again, the nWo faded away to nothing. As the WCW finally hit an iceberg and sank, the talent the show actually had was rescued by WWE. nWo would be revived, and a set up to have the ultimate face off of nWo vs DX at long last was in the works, but of coarse, Scott Hall ruined it by being a drunken drug addict and a bunch of injuries put what could of been the best ratings ever in wrestling history was swept under the ring and forgotten about.

To find out exactly how something that could have been great had they have known how to keep racing at full speed had any of them had their drivers license is done, then this DVD's hour long presentation of rehashed clips from the last nWo release on DVD is just what the doctor ordered. See Cody Rhoads talk about boring things from a fans pov watching the nWo as a kid, and focus more about his grandfather being part of the nWo than anything else. Second hand rehashed information and interviews seen in previous releases, and then enjoy 3 discs of matches and interviews of the nWo boring the pants off you as they gang up on guys who almost beat nWo members in the ring. Oh, and and full coverage of some of the worst matches and ideas in wrestling history, like Hogan running his mouth off for 20 minutes saying, ""This guy in the crowed is now a member of the nWo, this ring post is now a member of the nWo, this railing is now part of the nWo"" then sit back and watch the next weeks clips where they are kicked out of the nWo for not being nWo enough.

If only we could get the WWE to finally bring out a DX video that tells it how it was from start to finish, then you would see what a great faction that new what they where doing, and never lost site, had many memorable highlights/moments, not to mention knew when to disband and reform again, then you would see a DVD release truly worthy of watching. Not a DVD filled with guys saying the obvious, ""it started off great, then we blew it"". Way to state the obvious in this waste of time watching.

nWo did nothing really. They formed, looked like a WWE invasion, and then messed it up. At least factions like DX has several memorable moments that could not be contained on just one DVD. Yet the nWo gets a rehash treatment? So let's count the nWo memories. Hall shows up on Nitro. One. Nash shows up with him. 2. Hogan is the 3rd man. 3. More recruits of past WWE members. 4. ... ummm... then what? Ummmm... thinking, thinking, thinking... pffftt... no wonder the feature presentation is about 45 minutes long. Come on WWE, bring out the complete history of DX already, not this junk.",1370304000,,4705,4.26427771556551

5187141,3,B008WAM2QK,"The main problem with this video can be contributed to McMahon's ludicrous rule that no one involved with TNA can be interviewed. As such, you miss interviews with Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan. This leaves a glaring hole in the documentary with only Kevin Nash providing anything interesting to say. Secondly, in the special roundtable, a bunch of old WWF guys sit around bashing WCW the entire time. Nothing but a bunch of resentful idiots. Even Kevin Nash sounds like he hated the entire experience. But, it was great to see Mean Gene again!

The matches included in this collection really make it worth it. Lots of PPV matches that you won't find anywhere else that show the nWo in all of it's glory, including the Dennis Rodman and Jay Leno matches just for fun.

Buy this for the matches, but watch Monday Night Wars and The Rise and Fall of WCW for a better documentary experience.",1366761600,2,887,4.643312101910828

5187144,3,B008WAM2QK,"nW0: The Revolution is a nice jaunt down memory lane for wrestling fans, but it fails to deliver any real new information or go too in-depth. Much of the DVD commentary can be found on older releases like ""The Monday Night Wars,"" and there wasn't much in regards to storylines/angles/behind-the-scenes stuff.

There are updated interviews with Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman, but the majority of the product is rehashed material. The DVD glosses over the nWo splitting, it's reformation during the Vince Russo-era, and says almost nothing about the last incarnation with the original 3 (Hall, Nash, and Hogan) in WWE.

Honestly, the best part of the DVD is the collection of matches. The WWE did right with their match selections and that might be worth the $20 to buy.",1361404800,,766,4.884615384615385
5187165,3,B008WAM2QK,"If only WWE would put as much work into their WCW releases as they do with their own WWE products, this could be a killer DVD set. It is, however, comforting that the DVD about the Attitude era is even slightly more dissapointing.
What the nWo is, and where it came from is widely known, so it shouldn't need an introduction. However, after watching this set, you still won't know more than you already did.

With 3 full DVDs in this set, I really expected a good, long documentary about the origins of the nWo, and especially where it headed with the Wolfpac, especially during the period of 1999-2000. I expected comments, real comments, by people like Bischoff or Nash and Hall and Hogan, and later participants like Jarrett or Bret Hart, talking honestly about some backstage politics.

But what we get is an extremely boring and inconsistent collage that last a mere hour. Yes, basically four years condensed into one hour. And the time after 1998 is only mentioned in a sentence or two. What we get here does not go into detail even a little bit, it basically just covers the major events for the nWo. What statements we get from the participating people, Nash, Hall, Bischoff, Waltman, are all taken from years and years ago, revealing that in fact, save for one or two of them, no real effort was put into making interviews specifically for this set.
It should be noted that at the point of production, Scott Hall and probably Waltman too had severe personal issues, but you could have easily made the effort to get other people.
One person that is frequently shown is Dusty Rhodes, and I can't help but wonder why that is. He was a member of the nWo for a period, but no doubt that this is not really the person to tell hard facts about backstage politics between the other individuals. His son Cody tells again and again about him watching the shows as a kid. All fine in theory, but when all is done in 60 minutes, it must appear like a great waste of time.

Around 50 minutes is spent on the time between summer 1996 and fall 1997, the rest, 10 minutes worth, is spent by all participants saying nothing more but ""once the Wolfpac existed, it wasn't like the good old days anymore"". And that's it. And it would have been endlessly interesting to hear what people had to say why certain decisions were made.
To cap all this meaningless fluff off, Vince Russo is allowed a few seconds of screentime to say his great plan (read: disaster) to revive the nWo fell apart when Bret Hart was injured, and that it wouldn't have made sense without him (yes, Russo speaks about making sense).

The suspicion arises that the set is in this shape because you couldn't possibly make an honest display of the history of the nWo without having people talk negative about both themselves and others. Very few interesting aspects are very very briefly brushed up against, but discarded quickly.
The bitter cherry on this cake is that in the end, they say quite directly that the WWE run of the nWo was made for nothing but monetary reasons and merchandise sales.

What makes the set still worthwhile is the second and third discs, which include, amongst the very obvious stuff (like Bash at the Beach 96 and 97, Starrcade 96, 97 and 98) also title matches on Nitro that would probably get lost in the future otherwise (unless WWE decided to release the complete Nitro anthology). But it would still have been nice to include other matches instead of the Starrcade main events that are all on the Starrcade DVD that was released earlier.

I would give 1 1/2 stars for the documentary, but the matches themselves raise the set to 3 stars.",1358985600,,3630,4.568356374807988

5187173,2,B008WAM2QK,"This might as well be called, ""What Dusty Rhodes and his son think of the NWO"".  About 70% of the interviews are from the perspective of Dusty Rhodes and his son.  It's a lot of opinion with no behind the scenes footage and no solid match footage.  What isn't interviews from the Rhodes family is out of date interviews and Kevin Nash continually pointing fingers for the fall of WCW and the NWO.  Like all WWE licensed doc's on the WCW, it touches on nostalgia, but focuses a large amount of time on the company's demise.

This overall is a bad buy.  It doesn't have any good interviews from the wrestlers who mattered, it barely spends anytime talking about the NWO's storyline or chronology, all it does is shove opinion after opinion about the NWO down your throat while showing old WCW B roll.  It's a cash in on nostalgia and nothing more.",1357430400,,845,4.483660130718954

Wish they had used a different War Games than the one they did (fake Sting one or Henning turning on the Horsemen).  A World War 3 match from the era or any number of omissions.

This time around its far more detailed, but it still feels far too short.  WWE's Four Horsemen DVD was a perfect example of what this should have been; a full-length documentary on the group where they don't pull any punches.  This was just too short and came off like a general overview of the hisotry of the group without any extra information that would have flushed out the story and given a more in-depth look.",1356480000,,536,4.448979591836735

I know Scott Hall has problems but to not have Hogan talk about being in the group or changing from face to heel in retrospect makes me feel like I wasted 20 bucks. Once again, if you're waiting on the feud with Sting and the Nwo it's briefly mentioned like in the other. wcw DVDs. There's great clips of it for sure but
to me it's not doing that rivalry any justice.  It brought back a lot of fond memories but it's not as great of a package as it could be.
Yours, Axel Guacamole",1356307200,,696,4.3538461538461535
5187260,4,B008WAM2QK,"This is an excellent chronicle of the beginnings of the NWO in WCW all the way to its existence in WWE.  If you are a fan of classic superstars such as Macho Man Randy Savage, Sting, Hulk Hogan, Lex Luger, etc. this dvd is for you.  The two stand out matches for me personally are Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage vs. The Outsiders and Sting vs. The Giant for control of the WCW tag team championship.",1356307200,,403,4.220779220779221
5187261,4,B008WAM2QK,"No longer watch wrestling, just an old fan from my childhood, but the NWO was one of the best things in the history of wrestling. This DVD collection is a major upgrade over the only other previous wwf release which was a single dvd called back in black",1355875200,3,253,4.291666666666667
5187262,5,B008WAM2QK,"Great i laughed all the way though. and couldn't stop at all, give it 5 stars and would tell others to watch",1355875200,,108,3.9545454545454546
5187263,3,B008WAM2QK,The documentary portion was too short. Other than that it was good. They could have gone into more depth. It felt rushed.,1355011200,,121,4.545454545454546
5187264,2,B008WAM2QK,"Same gripe as everyone else; you get a documentary on one of the biggest and longest running angles in the history of modern wrestling that lasts 62 minutes.  Just totally disappointing with no new information put forth.  The only real highlight is a very honest Kevin Nash, but there is no mention of ANY of the true life backstage drama that let the nWo angle get totally out of control and eventually led to the downfall of WCW.  In fact the documentary is very much in kayfabe at times, which at this point in time is just truly baffling.  The match selection is OK, but just keep in mind that this was WCW in the late 90's, match quality was NOT a priority.  After some truly incredible releases from WWE Home Video (Bret Hart's release, Rise and Fall of ECW, Monday Night Wars to name a few) this set is just a total disappointment.",1354320000,,838,4.415584415584416
5187285,4,B008WAM2QK,I expected a lot more on this DVD. The documentary wasn't that great. The matches and extras however is worth the buy.,1354320000,,118,4.409090909090909
5187286,5,B008WAM2QK,The round table discussion was awesome. The matches were good too. It is almost a rehash of the Monday Night Wars and the previous NWO DVD. The WWE did very little to promote the DVD.,1354147200,,183,4.257142857142857
5187287,4,B008WAM2QK,"The NWO the Revolution is good, but there is something missing that they should've add in the DVD such as Xpac firing, how Vince McMahon feels about the NWO, and more interviews from other former NWO members like Bret Hart and HBK. The dvd did explained more about their impact and their feud, unlike the Back in Black DVD. Surprisingly, it also contained interviews with Vince Russo and Lex Luger. Lastly, the dvd extras has all the matches and promos that the NWO: Back in Black already has.",1354060800,,493,4.613636363636363
5187288,5,B008WAM2QK,loved this dvd set already one of my favorites wish they would make a nexus dvd that would be sweet,1353801600,,99,4.0
5187289,3,B008WAM2QK,"unreal...the fact that there is no digital copy included is a disgrace!!!  once again WWE fails its fan base, something it seems to be doing a lot lately.",1353283200,,154,4.5
5187290,3,B008WAM2QK,"This is an ambitious release for the WWE, but similar to other WCW-related releases, it ultimately falls short of expectations.  There is a lot of information in the DVD, but it's disorganized and is comprised of mostly opinions rather than details relating to the NWO; This release could have been more thorough.  A specific list of members throughout the stable's various incarnations isn't mentioned aside from the Big 3, Hall, Nash, and Hogan, and recycled interviews from Hall, Hogan, and Bischoff make up only a small fraction of the DVD's content.  There are a few brief clips from Vince Russo, Vince McMahon, and Lex Luger, which is nice.  However, there is probably more content from Cody Rhodes than from anyone else, who isn't a relevant figure in the NWO story.  Essentially, WWE doesn't include any material related to the NWO that we haven't already seen in its previous releases and the vast majority of interviews included are insufficient.  In addition, it would have been nice to hear more about the WWF's take on the rise and fall of the NWO, but this release doesn't mention hardly anything.  The matches alone are certainly worth the buy, and if not for its extensive list of matches, I wouldn't give this release more than 2 stars.

Pros:
An extensive list of famous WCW/NWO matches
Interviews from Lex Luger and Vince Russo included in a WWE documentary
The WWF logo is present without the censorship

Cons:
Recycled interviews
Same stories being retold
A lack of WWF superstars' opinions on the NWO

5187291,3,B008WAM2QK,"Many upon many wrestling fans know the story of the NWO and how is started in such grand and shocking fashion in 1996, with Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall wreaking havoc on the WCW wrestlers and the company as a whole. The group grew in numbers, split into their own factions and for better or worse left a big mark on the wrestling world during the attitude era of wrestling.

This is the story of how the group came to be and all the controversial moments that happened during their run on TV. The documentary itself is pretty much a glossing over of the NWO's best and worst times, it covers the beginning, the Bash at the Beach formation, the NWO vs. WCW storyline, the feud with Sting and others during its barely over 60 minute running time.

There is some reused footage from the Monday Night War, NWO: Back In Black and other DVDs with interviews from Eric Bischoff, Hulk Hogan and new interviews with Kevin Nash, Ted DiBiase, Booker T, DDP, Vince Russo (two interviews but still a bit of a stunner), Arn Anderson, Cody Rhodes, Lex Luger (nice to hear from him) and other people who were either part of the group or with WCW at the time. There are some good moments to relive during the bio but the overall presentation felt rushed big time.

Extras on Disc 1

-5/27/96, Scott Hall's Nitro Debut: We see Hall come in through the crowd, get in the ring and cut a promo which planted the seeds for the upcoming NWO storyline. Good segment.

-6/10/96, Kevin Nash's Nitro Debut: Scott Hall comes down to the announce booth and while Bischoff's back is turned Nash appears and he cuts a promo saying they're prepared to go to war.

-11/18/96, Rowdy Roddy Piper Confronts Eric Bischoff: Piper comes out, the crowd goes nuts and he confronts Bischoff. We get the usual ramblings from Roddy and this leads to the NWO coming down and it being revealed that Bischoff is part of the group. Very well done segment.

-12/30/96, Hollywood Hulk Hogan Confronts Rowdy Roddy Piper: After their match at Starrcade the previous night, Piper is in the ring cutting a promo like only he can. Hogan comes down and they banter back and forth, there's the expected run in by some of the NWO and they beat up Piper. The Giant just lets Piper go from the chokeslam and Hulk slaps him leading to The Giant choking out Hogan, then the group beats up The Giant. This did do its job in setting up the rematch Piper and Hogan would have soon after.

-2/17/02, No Way Out, The NWO's WWE Debut: The PPV gets kicked off with Hogan, Hall and Nash coming to the ring saying they were here to make the WWE better, which we all know was a lie by the end of the show.

Matches on Disc 1

-7/7/96, WCW Bash At The Beach, Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting, Lex Luger & ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage: Shortly after each man made their debuts, Hall and Nash were supposed to have a third man coming into this match but Hall said ""He's here and he's ready"". It starts out hot, Luger hits some power moves, Sting gets the tag hits the Stinger Splash in the corner which accidentaly knocks out Lex. Now we're down to 2 on 2, Nash and Hall do work over each guy, mainly Sting who keeps fighting back and makes the tag to Savage who goes nuts, hits a double axe handle on Hall, goes to attack Nash who hits a lowblow. Hulk Hogan comes down, then hits a leg drop on Savage, then him, Hall and Nash beat up both guys. Love how the post match promo was included as Hulk runs down WCW, the fans and christens the group ""The New World Order of Wrestling, brother"". 11/10, for the match and the post match promo.

(Available on NWO: Back In Black)

-8/10/96, WCW Hog Wild, WCW Championship Match, Hulk Hogan vs. The Giant (Champion): Very infamous match that was actually not too bad but was typical of his matches against big guys. Giant used a lot of power moves while Hogan tried every dirty trick to win the title, Giant even hulked up and hit the leg drop, he also fought off Hall and Nash but Hogan hit Giant with the title belt and made the cover to win the match and the title. 6/10.

(Available on Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology)

-10/27/96, WCW Halloween Havoc, WCW World Tag Team Championship Match, The Outsiders vs. Harlem Heat (Champions) w/Sherri and Col. Parker: Pretty good one here as the NWO was really in full takeover mode and were looking to capture the tag titles, power for power and Hall and Nash try to intimidate both Booker and Stevie but they won't back down. Nash seems more motivated than he was in most of his WCW matches but he also gets double teamed by both Heat members. There's the build-up to the hot tag and Harlem Heat looks to have the match won after Booker hits the Harlem Hangover, but when Parker tries to help he just hands the cane to Nash and runs off. Nash hits Stevie with it and Hall covers to win the titles. 7/10.

(Available on Allied Powers: The World's Greatest Tag Teams)

-11/9/96, NWO Saturday Night, Syxx vs. The Bounty Hunter: This was a goofy one in an empty arena where Cruiserweight champion Syxx was facing some jobber, a bunch of NWO talents are around the ring and this is also in black and white. As a match it was a joke, Syxx ends up getting the win quickly, at least as a segment this was sorta funny and had a unique look. That being said 1/10, watch once then skip.

-1/25/97, NWO Souled Out, WCW World Tag Team Championship Match, The Outsiders (Champions) vs. The Steiner Brothers: From the very awful and one time only NWO PPV, we get this not too bad tag team match where the Steiners looked to take back the titles from the NWO. Its really power for power here with some wrestling mixed in and the NWO rogue referee Nick Patrick really makes the odds totally against the Steiners, Rick hits a very impressive power slam on Nash at one point. Later there's a ref bump, Rick hits a diving bulldog on Hall and another ref comes down counting Hall down for three, so we have new champions. 5/10, cause the pace was slow.

-2/23/97, WCW Superbrawl VII, WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper: So coming into this Piper got ready by being locked in the shutdown island prison of Alcatraz? Whatever you say WCW writing staff, but that doesn't take away from this match, not that much could be added to make this anymore interesting than their Starrcade contest two months back. Roddy attacked Hulk in the entrance way and just mauled him in the early going, Hogan does take over with dirty tactics. Randy Savage comes down to ringside, Piper slaps on the sleeper hold and looks to have won the match but Savage pulls Hulk's legs under the ropes then gives some knucks to Hogan and he hits a loaded punch and covers to win. 4/10, for the sloppy finish.

-7/13/97, WCW Bash At The Beach, Hulk Hogan & Dennis Rodman vs. Lex Luger & The Giant: Pretty good tag match considering whose involved the fans pop big when Hulk and Rodman come out, some good power displays by Luger and Giant and the expected dirty tactics by Hogan and Rodman. The action is equal parts slow and fast paced, Rodman does well given his lack of wrestling ability (listen to the fans react when he first arm drags Luger). Nice face off between the Giant and Rodman, later there a run in by a fake Sting who attacks the Giant. Hulk accidentaly hits Rodman, Lex locks on the Torture Rack and Hulk gives up. 6/10, for the crowd reaction. Luger then Rack's Savage and Rodman.

Disc 2

-10/26/97, WCW Halloween Havoc, Las Vegas Sudden Death Match, Diamond Dallas Page vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage: These two had a pretty good rivalry and this was a hard hitting match that was under Last Man Standing rules, simply put you win when your opponent can't answer the 10 count. Savage targets the injured ribs of DDP, while DDP simply won't quit as he keeps fighting back, it goes in the crowd, weapons get used and its just an all out and fun brawl. Miss Elizabeth and DDP's wife Kimberly have a catfight (a dream match of mine for obvious reasons), near the end ""Sting"" comes down and hits DDP with a bat and he stays down for 10, so Savage wins. 7/10.

-12/29/97, WCW Monday Nitro, World Heavyweight Championship Match, Sting (Champion) vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan: At least this one starts off faster than their Starrcade match, Hogan hits Sting with the title belt and chokes him out in the early going. Sting comes back slamming Hulk into the guardrail then battles back and takes it to Hogan, hitting his trademark Stinger Splash, the second one knocks the ref down. Nick Patrick comes in, Hulk hits a roll up and pulls the tights to get the three and the title. But wait the original ref restarts the match, Sting locks on the Scorpion Deathlock and Hogan taps out so Sting wins. 5/10, there's a melee as wrestlers from the NWO and WCW run in having a brawl which was better than the actual match.

-4/20/98, WCW Monday Nitro, No Disqualification Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage (Champion): Its not their Wrestlemania V main event but for where they were in their careers at this point it was decent, the No DQ rule helps mask how both were past their prime. Hogan wore down Randy (who was plenty beat up from being run down by a car courtesy of Hogan), while Savage does fight back even from a couple of hard chair shots.  Later The Disciple attacks the ref and he and Hulk double team Savage taking out his bad knee, Kevin Nash runs down, hits Bischoff and powerbombs Hogan, puts Randy on Hulk, Bret Hart runs down, hits Nash with the belt and Hogan covers to win. 6/10.

-6/14/98, WCW The Great American Bash, Match for Control of the World Tag Team Championship, Sting vs. The Giant: So Sting and Giant won the tag titles but Giant joined NWO Hollywood shortly before this, so we have this match between the Wolfpac and Hollywood. Sting did hit some great offense, but Giant overpowered the smaller man hitting an impressive press slam launching Sting into the top turnbuckle. Sting comes back with a huge slam, then three Scorpion Death Drops, the last from high above and he covers to win. 6/10.

-8/8/98, WCW Hog Wild, Hulk Hogan & Eric Bischoff vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Jay Leno: Here's one thats much more infamous for being much more comedic due to Bischoff and Leno being involved while Hulk and DDP did well when they faced off. The spot where Leno put Hogan on an arm bar for seemingly forever was just beyond sad to watch and was one of the reasons people started tuning out WCW. Jay's band leader Kevin Eubanks got involved near the end hitting a Diamond Cutter on Bischoff then Leno covers to win. 3/10. Hogan, The Disciple and Bischoff attack them then Goldberg hits a double spear on Hulk and Eric and celebrates with DDP and Leno.

-9/13/98, WCW Fall Brawl, War Games Match to Determine The #1 Contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, Team WCW (DDP, Roddy Piper & Warrior) vs. Team Hollywood (Stevie Ray, Bret Hart & Hollywood Hulk Hogan) vs. Team Wolfpac (Sting, Lex Luger & Kevin Nash): The double cage was the battle ground but the 3 team format lends a different feel. DDP and Bret Hart start out, it stays at a good pace and once more guys get in it picks up, though Warrior's entrance is quite humorous as smoke fills the ring, he's in the ring gets knocked down, more smoke then he's gone and comes down the entrance way to the ring officially (confusing to say the least). Hulk runs out of the ring after getting slammed into it by Warrior a few times, the action seems to stop during this as Warrior breaks down the cage wall and climbs out to get to Hogan. DDP ends up hitting the Diamond Cutter on Stevie Ray and covers to win. 6/10.

-12/27/98, Starrcade '98, WCW Heavyweight Championship Match, Kevin Nash Vs. Goldberg (Champion): A big man/bigger man match, that had that big fight feel to it with the main drawing points being Nash's reputation vs. Goldberg's undefeated streak and title. It was power versus power, both men hitting high impact power moves, the match overall was booked well, except for the finish. The fans were finally starting to turn on Goldberg at points during this match, even cheering the finish where there were run-ins by Disco Inferno, Bam Bam Bigelow and Scott Hall using a cattle prod on Goldberg. Nash hits the Jacknife powerbomb on Goldberg for the pin in 10 minutes. Winner and new WCW World Champion Kevin Nash. 6/10, cause of the poorly booked finish.

(Available on Starrcade: The Essential Collection and NWO: Back In Black)

-12/20/99, WCW Monday Nitro, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Bill Goldberg vs. Bret Hart: The previous night at Starrcade Bret had suffered a concussion that would lead to the end of his in ring career and while he did well that it was quite obvious that he was a bit off. Good match though that sees Hall and Nash come down and beat Goldberg with baseball bats, soon Bret joins in the beating, Piper comes down to protect Goldberg. Bret covers Goldberg to win the title. 6/10. Jeff Jarrett comes down and hits Piper with the guitar and we see the rebirth of the NWO.

(Available on The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro)

-3/11/02, Raw, The Rock & Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Scott Hall & Hollywood Hulk Hogan: This was to hype the upcoming Wrestlemania matches involving these men, its not a bad tag match, the crowd is at least pretty hot for the confrontations between the four. At least the fans get to see a brief face/off between Austin & Hogan (too bad we could never get a full match between the two). It ends with Hogan hitting the leg drop and covering Rock to get the win (which I still believe should've happened at Wrestlemania). 6/10.

(Available on NWO: Back In Black)

Blu-Ray Exclusive Extras

-NWO ""Legends of Wrestling"" Roundtable Discussion Featuring Kevin Nash, Jim Ross, J.J. Dillion & Michael Hayes: The famed show Legends of Wrestling show tackles the topic of the NWO which featured some great stories and Nash really lended some great insight to some of the good and the bad that went on in WCW. I would say this is better than the actual biography.

-7/27/96, WCW Saturday Night, Invitation Only: Cool NWO promo with Hulk, Nash and Hall talking about the takeover and who else is gonna join the group. Hulk also runs down The Giant saying he's gonna take his title at Hog Wild.

-8/3/96, WCW Saturday Night, Nothing Personal: More stuff from the guy's running down some of the WCW talent, including the guys they beat up in the parking lot on a recent Nitro.

-9/30/96, WCW Monday Nitro, Room Service: Hulk is with members of the NWO talking about how great it is to be in charge. Funny to see the fake Sting and how it was such a bad imitation of the icon.

-1/20/97, WCW Monday Nitro, It's Not Easy Being King: Good, classic promo from Eric Bischoff as he was always better as a bad guy as he was just easy to hate.

-3/17/97, WCW Monday Nitro, The Real Hot Rod: Its Hulk and Rodman where ""The Worm"" talks about why he's here in WCW and with the NWO.

-4/28/97, WCW Monday Nitro, The Madness: Good stuff with Randy Savage where he talks about the Madness while Elizabeth just chimes in here and there, also he talks about facing DDP.

-9/22/97, WCW Monday Nitro, I Got A Spot: Montage of clips from the infamous NWO Arn Anderson retirement speech.

-9/22/97, WCW Monday Nitro, Average Intelligence: More stuff from the Retirement speech mocking.

-2/22/99, WCW Monday Nitro, No Respect For Tradition: This is a weird one as David Flair is in a locker room and his dad Ric Flair arrives to confront him. Torrie Wilson is with David and Disco Inferno and other members of the NWO mocking Ric and the Horsemen.

In the end the whole documentary while having some good moments and a little bit of new insight was pretty basic and really didn't give a ton of details, just saying ""This was the reason it worked then, this is the reason it failed"" and so on. The promos included were good in part, some weren't so great, the matches also had some average ones, some on other collections and some rare ones. The roundtable extra was such a good piece that made me so happy I bought the Blu-Ray edition. So even if you have the previous WWE NWO DVD Back In Black this is a good one to pick up, just don't expect a detailed bio.",1352678400,3,17065,4.4940264772360345
5187292,4,B008WAM2QK,"It was the storyline/group that lead the change of wrestling to the point where ""sports entertainment"" was at it's most popular than it's been since the 1980's as what started as a hostile takeover became a revolution as you saw the infamous logo almost everywhere & the notes from the theme song are still memorable to this stay...all of this can be put into 3 letters, n. W.o.  This is WWE's second (and better) presentation discussing the history & evolution of this group with new comments from people such as Booker T, Arn Anderson, Dusty & Cody Rhodes, Bill DeMott, Diamond Dallas Page, Kevin Nash, Billy Kidman, Sean Waltman, Vince Russo, Matt Striker, Ted Dibiase, Joe Hennig, Mike Rotundo, Big Show, Lex Luger along with archival comments from Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Scott Hall, Jimmy Hart, and Hulk Hogan.

The documentary stars off talking about the signing of big stars from WWE to WCW such as Scott Hall & Kevin Nash going into the details of how everything went down & how the timing was just perfect before discussing how things were done to make the perception of the angle look very realistic & the reactions to the reveal of the infamous ""third man"" at Bash At The Beach.  The new members added to the trio were discussed such as how one man lost his purpose when Eric Bischoff joined the group followed by how the concept of their ""The Following Announcement..."" was created along with how everything they did looked like real chaos to the point where Cody Rhodes told the story of what his Dad told him when he saw Rey Mysterio threw into the trailer.  The popularity of the group was discussed in details about how they were anti-heroes to the point where one current WWE superstar had nWo jerseys for his baseball team, how that came about with unpredictability & realism, and how things got so huge it became it's own brand.  Issues with the group becoming so large was talked about with them adding any wrestler who had some value with Cody & Joe giving their memories on their fathers being the in the group, how it became like a real life gang backstage, how some felt it should have been more exclusive with one talent talking about how he was invited but turned it down, and how there were so many problems (such as the Souled Out PPV) that people just started to not care anymore.  Sting's role against the nWo was briefly discussed before going into the media crossover of celebrities such as Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone & Jay Leno involvement with this group with people giving their different opinions about it including one going as far as to say WCW ""prostituted"" themselves.  One of the biggest highlights of this presentation was discussed next in the beginning of the end of the group starting to the formation of the Wolfpac, the creative control issues, how it started to become overkill with other groups, how evil always won, Vince Russo himself discussing why nWo 2000 failed, and the WWE revival of the group before ending the documentary talking about what the legacy of the group with one person probably saying it best, ""We weren't the Beatles but we were definitely Zepplin.""

Matches include:
Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting, Lex Luger, Randy Savage - This match was subtitled ""The Hostile Takeover"" as this was ""The Outsiders"" in-ring debut after appearing on WCW's television shows for weeks. It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCW's team against Hall & Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall & Nash to go it alone & Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match. This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths (Nash's size & power, Sting & Hall's in-ring ability, Savage's unpredictability) along with Hall & Nash doing the classic ""double teaming behind the referee's back"" tactics various times. The ending with Hulk Hogan transforming into Hollywood Hogan & the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history.

[nWo: Back In Black]

Hollywood Hogan vs. WCW Champion Giant - Hogan's first match since revealing himself to be the third member of the nWo complete with a new look as he was starting to grow in the black beard with the red & yellow colors replaced with black & white.  The first couple of minutes into the match was a game of ""cat & mouse"" as Giant initially kept cutting Hogan off from coming into the ring only for Hogan to keep going to the outside whenever Giant executed an offensive move or his offense didn't work.  Giant showed he had the superior strength advantage causing Hogan to resort to dirty tactics like pulling hair to keep Giant down & the fight to the outside with both men using the ringpost before Hogan got a taste of his own medicine when Giant ""hulked up"" on him.  The match itself wasn't much but showcased the new heelish in-ring style of Hogan with the biggest story behind what happened after the match when the nWo definitely ""left it's mark.""

[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Collection]

The Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat - These teams were almost mirror images of each other as they had the combination of the in-ring worker (Hall & Booker) having a bigger & stronger partner (Stevie & Nash) as Hall & Booker started out as Hall was hip tossed over the top rope at one point before Stevie Ray took a shot on the outside that caused Hall to spit at Stevie before tagging in Nash only for Stevie to take down Nash & give Hall a receipt.  Both teams showed that they had no problems bending the rules to their advantage as they used the same tactics against each other such as taking shots being the referee's back & double teaming with Sister Sherri even getting involved from time to time before she got caught by Hall & got a taste of ""machismo"" for her troubles.  This was the only time I recall these teams facing each other (which is a crime) as they worked well together & had a very good match.

[Allied Powers: Wresting's Greatest Tag Teams]

Syxx vs. The Bounty Hunter - This was only on here to showcase the ""nWo Saturday Night"" concept (which Nash went into details about on the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" on the blu-ray) which was completely different than what you saw in regular WCW matches from the production to the nWo members themselves doing everything from the ring announcing to commentary but the in-ring action itself was nothing more than just an ""enhancement"" match.
""nWo Saturday Night"" Nov. '96

WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Steiner Brothers - For those who don't already know about this event, this was the New World Order's solo PPV meaning that it was completely different than any other WCW PPV with Eric Bischoff & Ted Dibiase providing commentary, Nick Patrick refereeing every single match & a completely different look even down to the fact that only the nWo members had entrance music.  The dream match was Scott Steiner's second match back after his back injury as both teams were evenly matched & traded momentum throughout the match causing Hall & Nash to take shots on Rick behind the ref's back to get the advantage building the hot tag to Scott before all four men ended up brawling with Nick Patrick getting caught in the line of fire causing someone else to take matters into their own hands.  Both of these teams would go on to feud over the titles for the rest of the year but this was one of their best encounters in the feud.
nWo Souled Out '97

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Roddy Piper - This was the rematch from their previous Starrcade encounter only with the WCW title being on the line & Piper coming straight from spending a week in the Alcatraz prison before this match.  Piper went after Hogan with a vengeance here starting in the isle breaking any rule he can from eye rakes to low blows to choking before even using a chair before taking out other nWo members at ringside.  Hogan was able to regain some control working over Piper & trying to keep him grounded before Piper was able to make his comeback but it was an unexpected presence that would not only turn the favor but also result in a new member of the New World Order but overall it was what you expect from Piper & Hogan although not as competitive as their previous match at Starrcade.
SuperBrawl VII

Hollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman vs. Lex Luger & Giant - One year later after the New World Order was born, NBA star Dennis Rodman makes his WCW in-ring debut here with Randy Savage being in their corner.  The match started out with Hogan & Luger going back & forth before Rodman was eventually tagged in complete with him still wearing his bandana & sunglasses showing up Luger with an armdrag before Luger returned the favor arm dragging Rodman's sunglasses & bandana off his face & out the ring but Rodman got more serious leapfrogging & shoulder blocking Luger down before he eventually got caught by Luger & again when he tried to do it against Giant.  Hogan & Rodman worked together with double teaming including a hip toss on Giant & double clothesline while Rodman also threw some elbows in the corner before all four men were in the ring at the same time leading to a special appearance & also a ""Sports Center"" moment.
WCW Bash At The Beach '97

Death Match: Randy Savage vs. Dallas Page - After having an intense feud for over the past 6 months, their final encounter had to be held under rules where it didn't end until one man was the last man standing.  DDP came in not wearing his ring gear but jeans & t-shirt with his ribs taped as both men started the brawl on the outside with Page choking Savage with his own shirt with Savage targeting Page's ribs with stomps & kicks while also hanging DDP on the ring ropes & both men being so intense that they knocked each other out with a double lariat at one point.  DDP went outside of his usual offense pulling moves like a springboard over the top onto Savage but hit his ribs on the guardrail with Savage hitting a double axe right onto the ribs before continuing the brawling not only on the outside but destroying the stage as well & heading back to the ring where a television camera got destroyed & Elizabeth got involved too many times for one woman's taste as well.  This match was no different than their entire rivalry, intense from start to finish & even after the match too.
WCW Halloween Havoc '97

Hollywood Hogan vs. WCW Champion Sting - The was the rematch from controversial Starrcade the night before with Hogan being in the usual position of ""challenger.""  Hogan went on the offense early as he jumped Sting the moment he came into the ring followed by elbow drops & chokes before Sting was able to rebound & took the fight to the outside where Hogan was thrown into guardrails.  Both men traded momentum with the referee getting in the way resulting in a bigger controversy in regards to the World Title than we had already had going into the match but it was a better match than their Starrcade one & as a side note, this match was shown from start to finish unlike when it was originally aired.
""WCW Nitro"" Dec. '97

No Disqualification Match: WCW Champion Randy Savage vs. Hollywood Hogan - This was one of the most unique matches in the history of the not only the WCW Championship at that time but also the nWo as the group had officially split apart into two factions earlier in the night with Hogan in his own Hollywood group & Savage being in what would eventually be known as the Wolfpack while it should also be noted that Savage was coming into this match with a bad leg.  Hogan worked over Savage with punches & choking along with a chair on the outside while The Disciple got in his shots at well.  Savage was able to make a comeback such as using the weight belt but would also end up hurting himself with his bad leg with his offense allowing Hogan to work it over.  Things started to get out of hand with the no disqualification rule with various people getting involved before one unexpected person would end up being a difference maker resulting in a match that was as you would expect from these two at this stage in their career with the No DQ rule helping the match.
""WCW Nitro"" Apr. '98

WCW Tag Team Champion Sting vs. WCW Tag Team Champion Giant - For those who don't know the story behind this unique match, Sting & Giant were scheduled to face Hall & Nash for the WCW Tag Titles leading into the previous PPV of Slamboree but Giant joined nWo Hollywood the week before the match as they won the tag team titles only for Sting to not join Giant in nWo Hollywood & join the nWo Wolfpack leading to this match where the winner gets possession of both tag titles because these two were unable to work together to defend the titles.  Giant walked into the match smoking a cigarette & blew it in Sting's face leading to Sting to respond with a slap & attempting a ""stick & move"" offense by hitting Giant with moves like the Stinger Splash but Giant's size allowed him to block some of these attempts including Sting just bouncing off him when trying a crossbody & powering out of the Scorpion Deathlock causing Sting to resorting to dishing out extra amounts punishment to try to keep Giant down.  The match was pretty short & sweet.
WCW/nWo Great American Bash '98

Hollywood Hogan & Eric Bischoff vs. Dallas Page & Jay Leno - Leno made his present felt early on as he threw his drink onto Hogan & Bischoff on the outside while also taking a slap at Hogan when he was locking up with DDP with Kevin Eubanks even throwing Hogan back in the ring when he went to the outside before he was eventually the legal man against Hogan playing the game of ""cat & mouse"" eventually getting Hogan in an armbar & working with DDP for moves like a double clothesline.  Bischoff played the old ""Bobby Heenan"" role where he would only tag in whenever one of them was down with Hogan coming into save him whenever he was in trouble but we did get the eventual Leno vs. Bischoff showdown.  Seeing the names involved with this match (Bischoff & Leno), you got what you would expect with Hogan & DDP doing most of the in-ring work with Bischoff & Leno there more or less for entertainment/comedy relief (depending on your sense of humor) as it was Kevin Eubanks on the outside who got more physically involved in the match than both Leno & Bischoff.  While this was would be acceptable for a match on free TV, this match was the main event on a PPV that didn't go over well with critics both in & outside of WCW.
WCW/nWo Road Wild '98

War Games Match - Team nWo Wolfpack vs. Team nWo Hollywood vs. Team WCW: Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger vs. Hollywood Hogan, Stevie Ray, Bret Hart vs. Dallas Page, Warrior, Roddy Piper - While this War Games match was still contested with a roofed steel cage surrounding two rings, the rules were slightly different all the previous years in that there were three ""teams"" & you could also win the match by pinfall as well as submission with the person getting the fall challenging WCW Champion Goldberg at Halloween Havoc.  This match told a bunch of various stories & had unique situations such as Bret & DDP starting off the match, what Stevie Ray's intentions were, Roddy Piper showing that it was truly ""every man for himself"", the interaction between Bret & his own teammates, and the Warrior/Hogan confrontation.  This match resembled all the previous War Games matches in recent years where the violence took a backseat to pushing the storylines going forward.
WCW/nWo Fall Brawl '98

No Disqualification Match: Kevin Nash vs. WCW Champion Goldberg - Goldberg's streak was at 173-0 going into this match with both men taking & countering each others offense causing them to go outside of their comfort zones like going for submissions with Goldberg's anklelock & Nash's cross armbreaker before the hits got more impactful like a punch that knocked Nash down, Nash powering Goldberg down with a clothesline, Goldberg with a spinning neckbreaker & later spinning dropkick along with a snap slam, and even Nash using the low blow.  For two guys who have been know to be very limited in the ring, they gave a good ""big man"" power match with the only negative being the chaotic ending...which is typical of the nWo.
WCW/nWo Starrcade '98
[nWo: Back In Black; Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

WCW Championship Match: Bret Hart vs. Goldberg - This match was during the initial ""Vince Russo"" era of WCW & happened the night after Starrcade where we got that ""screwjob"" ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship & having a rematch here to determine the true champion. Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four. The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also ""The Band Is Back Together!""
""WCW Nitro"" Dec. '99
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro]

Hollywood Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash vs. Steve Austin & The Rock - This was the in-ring returns to the WWE of Hall & Nash in 6 years while it's been 9 years for Hogan...and also to my knowledge, this was the first ""official"" time that just the original members of the nWo in Hogan & Hall & Nash have teamed together.  Rock was clearly distracted as he kept trying to get at Hogan every chance he had which kept giving the nWo the advantage as Hall & Nash worked him over allowing Hogan to take in & get his shots in whenever Rock was already down while using the strategy of double & triple teaming when Austin was the legal man as well.  This was more of a short teaser match for their upcoming WrestleMania X8 matches but a fun RAW main event overall & as a side note for those hardcore wrestling fans, this is the closest you'll get to a Stone Cold vs. Hulk Hogan match as they did get physical a few times.
""RAW"" Mar. '02
[nWo: Back In Black]

DVD extras include moments such as Scott Hall & Kevin Nash's debuts, Roddy Piper confronting Eric Bischoff, the night after Starrcade when Hogan not only confronts Roddy Piper but someone else who keeps ""dropping the ball"", and the nWo's WWE debut while Blu-Ray extras include various promos from the group.  One special bonus on the Blu-Ray edition of this DVD set is the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" roundtable that airs on the WWE Classics On Demand channel with this discussion revolving around the New World Order group with Michael Hayes, Jim Ross, Gene Okerland, J.J. Dillion, and Kevin Nash with them showing various clips (some taken right from the ""Rise & Fall Of WCW"" DVD) to showcase the top discussion at hand.  Things started off with Nash discussing who the middle man was doing the negotiations between Scott Hall & Eric Bischoff going into the deals of the contract being offered such as ""Sting Money"" & ""favored nations.""  The details of some of the concept was discussed next such as if Eric Bischoff really took credit for this idea, the type of deal Hall & Nash were working under that would later benefit them, what had to be done both in-front & behind the camera to put over that the nWo was separate from WCW, what was incorporated from crossover music into their own image, and who was going to be the ""third man"" if Hogan didn't do it.  The discussion then turned to the idea that WCW wanted to put WWE out of business with J.J. Dillion giving a very detailed answer as to why that was never going to happen regardless of what the ratings were before Nash went into the unorganized issues he had behind the scenes such as royalties for merchandise.  How the nWo changed the business in both a positive & negative direction was up next before going into the problems within the storyline with Nash telling his story behind the infamous ""finger poke of doom"" & why it didn't work (although his timeline for events was WAY off).  The controversial mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech was talked about in detail along with the relationship between all the ""Kliq"" members despite being in opposite companies before going into the constantly leadership issues, lack of motivation, behind the scenes politics, the Wolfpack vs. Hollywood feud, and the legacy of the group ended the discussion.

The only real fault I can say is that the documentary only went around an hour long which sucks for those buying the regular version of this set but not that big of a deal for those getting the Blu-Ray as the roundtable went into more details.  I liked the matches as they didn't reuse matches from recent DVD releases (except Bret/Goldberg but that's understandable) and put a lot of matches that were previous unreleased or so old that it's nice to see them released again (like the ones from the original nWo DVD a decade ago).  In the end, I recommend this to a fan of the nWo/WCW/""Monday Night Wars"" period of wrestling but if your strictly about the matches then the regular version while those who like promos & discussion & documentaries would be better suited for the Blu-Ray edition.",1352592000,7,21153,4.57399577167019
5187293,5,B008WAM2QK,"I believe WWE released an NWO documentary a few years back. This documentary focused primarily on the forming of the NWO in WCW and how it skyrocketed WCW to be able to compete with WWE formerly WWF during the monday night war period. They went into detail about how the NWO established and legitimized WCW but also how it ended being it's ultimate downfall. They also put in a few minutes on how Vince brought back the NWO in the WWF to try to squeeze what was left of it in 2002. All in All the Documentary and Matches (even though most ended up with run ins) is worth the money and I'll give the WWE credit for trying to make a legitimate NWO documentary that showed how the group was formed, what the group accomplished as well as how it messed everything up in the end.",1352592000,,774,4.272108843537415
5187294,3,B008WAM2QK,"""Look at all this crap in the ring. This is what's in the future for you if you want to hang around this man Hall and this man Nash.""
 - Mean Gene

""All this crap in the ring represents all the fans here tonight.""
 - Hulk Hogan

That was the point for me where Hogan's NWO formation speech becomes the greatest wrestling promo of all time. The incredible shock associated with the Heel turn of the biggest Good Guy in the sports' history would have made any promo Hogan cut at that point notorious. And Hulk's incredible candor in discussing why he was bitter with the WWF (referred to as ""that organization up north"") and bored with his station in WCW presented a level of reality in the promo that we had never seen from him before, certainly qualifying it as the stuff of legend. But that perfect little comment about the ""Crap being the fans"" was what elevated it to the highest greatness, because when had we ever heard Hulk say something so clever, so timely and so unrehearsed? It's those moments of pure spontaneous magic when wrestling becomes transcendent. And spontaneity, shock-value and reality would prove to be the 3 core tenets of what would make the NWO the biggest wrestling faction of all time.*

Unfortunately it's hard to sustain any idea built around those 3 qualities, and thus was the case for the NWO. Beyond Bash at the Beach the spontaneous magic resurfaced infrequently. Realism was also all but forgotten at times and shock-value, though never forgotten, was in fact overused so much that it lost all impact as a story-telling devise. And combined all these things led to the group's downfall, and in the mind of some, the downfall of WCW.

That's of course the story most fans know when it comes to NWO and it's the one that the new release NWO: The Revolution attempts to tell. Over 3 discs we get an hour-long documentary, plus 16 matches and 5 other important in-ring moments. And while the matches and in-ring promos included are great for the most part, the documentary really has to rank as a disappointment.

The first problem with the doc, as is the criticism of many WWE docs, is the lack of interviews with certain key figures. In 2012, it should be no surprise to die-hards that a new film about the NWO would be a problematic production for WWE as 3 of the 4 key figures behind the faction can't be interviewed. Hogan is running the show at a rival company while Eric Bischoff, the WCW's former executive director and creative mastermind behind the NWO story, also worked for that company this year. And most unfortunate of all Scott Hall, the original Outsider who started the whole angle, is in no shape to participate in such productions as he continues to deal with drug problems, alcoholism and domestic issues. All that being said we do get to hear from all 3 figures in various archival interviews which certainly are crucial to telling the story.

So if the major players couldn't act as the prime storytellers the question then becomes who else does. Well we have the inclusion of new interviews with people giving a variety of different takes on the story from other one-time NWOers (Ted DiBiase, Sean Waltman, Big Show) to rival WCW wrestlers of the era (DDP, Booker T, Billy Kidman) to backstage personnel (Bill DeMott, Arn Anderson and most notably Vince Russo) to pure fans, at least at the time (Cody Rhodes, Joe Henning, Matt Striker).

Some non-NWO members present welcome additions to the film; case-in-point: Cody Rhodes, who serves to present the perspective of the kids who made the NWO so popular but also as someone who literally had a front row seat at many of the group most historic matches (""I was at Bash at the Beach. Fifth Row.""). Other people however have absolutely nothing interesting to add such as Booker T (""The thing I remember most about NWO was the music."" Really?!? That's what you remember most?) and Joe Hennig aka Michael McGillicutty who's as boring and uncharismatic a talker here as he is in the ring, with the most notable of his contributions talking about how Curt Hennig would watch back the tapes of himself cutting NWO promos and laugh (a story that I'm sure could have had us audiences members laughing too told by anyone else with an ounce of personality).

So with that being said, what was the rationale behind the choices of who appeared here? This is pure speculation on my part, but in looking at the list of people above, all of them (except Russo) are currently contracted to the WWE as either employees or ""legends"". Now obviously the WWE can't get the participation of people working for the rival promoter, and the unfortunate truth is that many former WCW wrestlers of the era have passed or like Hall, are in no psychical condition to appear, but I feel like there had to be more people central to the storyline who could have been included. Heck at minimum they could've waited until they finalized Goldberg's Legends deal and got him to talk about Starcade 98.

I suppose my frustration is brought on by the fact that they were able to get Russo, whom you would think would be the most elusive. And when he does talk you only want to hear more. I think of an early moment in the film where Russo explains that he believes that WCW simply ""fell into the NWO gimmick"" as if it was pure luck. There is such a jealously there, that as a fan, you really hope that the interviewer would prod him to open up to the point where he might actually say the things we all know he feels about Eric Bischoff etc. But that doesn't happen. In fact, that's the most interesting Russo clip in the piece, because he is barely in it at all. Again, we are left with frustration.

Now who's to say that in fact this was truly the list of everyone who could participate in the film, and everything that they said of any merit was included, however why not some additional perspective from WWF employees of the era? Why not talk about how the NWO was affecting the way they operated (Can anyone say DX?)? With the WWE owning the rights to these WCW properties, I personally had hoped all retrospective releases such as this could provide the side of the rival company (or companies: it would have been great to hear Paul Heyman talk about what parts of ECW the NWO were ripping off). I mean, sure the WWF perspective is not necessary for all WCW stories, but NWO was formed around the Outsiders ""from the company up north"" and there are several NWO incidents which directly affected WWF (Tony Schiavone's revelation of Mankind's WWF championship win happened the same night as The Fingerpoke of Doom and disgust over the latter led viewers to jump and watch RAW). Alas other than a quick comment from an archival Vince McMahon interview off the top (""When I saw their first show, I was like ""boy, this is real competition."") there is no such perspective presented.

Setting the storytellers aside the story itself is has several unfortunate flaws in it's telling as well. Certain things aren't very well explained (i.e. they show footage from the infamous ""breaking kayfabe"" hug by the Kliq the night Hall left WWF, but don't ever set it up to inform the viewer what they are watching), other things are convoluted (they make it seem like the Wolfpac and Hollywood factions reuniting in early `99 and the formation of NWO 2000 in late '99 were one and the same) and still others are omitted (they never inform the viewer the key fact that Nash was booking the show as well).

All this however is not to say I dislike everything about the doc. There are certainly some positives. Kevin Nash, love him or hate him, is at least willing to provide an opinion on anything & everything and that makes for highly watchable material. Namely he buries Hogan on a couple occasions, notably for his inability to talk with realism (As I said off the top Hogan's promos often seem to be recycled, scripted wrestling jargon). For example, Nash tells a great story of the distinctive NWO black and white PSAs being brought on by a necessity to cut Hulk's ""Memphis"" style promos to soundbytes so that they were tolerable to an audience. Of course Nash wasn't always the greatest talker himself despite his attempts at coming off as having a higher intellect (""You say this is where the big boys play Bischoff. Look at the adjective play. We aint here to play."" Sounds smart, but sorry Kev, play is a ""verb""). That high opinion Kevin had of himself is deflated somewhat in the doc which is refreshing to see, and he even admits it to himself somewhat, in talking about making poor choices and knowing that the NWO weren't ""as big as the beatles... maybe only as big as Zeppelin."" And that makes me like him more, maybe not as much as I did when I was 12 and the Wolfpac ""was in the Hizz-ouse!"", but certainly more than the Kevin Nash of the phantom text-message fame who showed up on WWE TV last year.

If anything the person I came away from the DVD with an increased opinion on most of all was Scott Hall. He always did a great job of keeping things simple. He keep promos short, stayed in his ""Bad Guy"" character, executed his move-set well in his matches and mugged up to the camera like nobody's business. He also comes off as well-spoken in archival interviews; candid and quotable (""In this business you can make friends or you can make money. I remember looking around at Kev, X-Pac, thinking I've already got friends, I'd like the money.""). Even when we get to the NWO revival in WWE, which I didn't follow at the time, I feared I would see traces of Hall falling off the rails into becoming what he is now (Seeing him in the promo photos of that era wearing the stupid headband with the knot tied in front, looking like I Love Lucy, made me cringe). Not the case. Hall still hits the Razor Ramon move set in the match with Austin and Rock and his physique is good enough that he just rocks the trunks like he always did, not falling victim to the Tommy Dreamer rule (Wrestlers who always wear shirts only do so to hide poor physiques).

Speaking of matches, the ones on the set are pretty great for the most part. Nearly all of the essential ones that stood on their own merit as good matches are here (with the exception of maybe Fall Brawl 96). Things like Rodman v. Malone or the Fingerpoke of Doom aren't missed as much given their generally agreed upon lack of quality. The only real match I disliked was the 98 War Games match which is very chaotic and messy both in the ring and on commentary (The announce team mixes up Hall and DDP at one point).

As per wanting more matches with ""lesser"" NWOers, I personally didn't. Some fans may point to ""Syxx vs. The Bounty Hunter"" as falling in that camp, but it's here more as a representation of the drastically different short-lived ""NWO Saturday night"" matches which the group staged for a period and is a real welcome addition.

In the end I'd say the set is worth purchasing if you're a fan who is buying it for matches more than the doc. But if you were thinking of it more for the doc, you are probably just as well off revisiting ""NWO: Back in Black"" a release the WWE put out after the NWO revival nearly a decade ago. That DVD may only have a few matches but based on it's description (I have not seen it) the doc in it seems to do exactly the same job telling the story (heck the ""archival interviews"" with Hogan, Hall and Bischoff were all taken from it).

I really hope next time the WWE wants to revisit a topic it's already released a DVD on, they do so only if they secure new interviews with important figures who weren't included in the earlier release, rather than the other way around, as is the case with NWO: The Revolution.
