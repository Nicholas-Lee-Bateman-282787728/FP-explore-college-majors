I would say there are better movies, don't waste your money like I did.",1318636800,,168,4.28125
8080439,4,B000AYEIBS,"Out of the three movies on offer here it doesn't really matter which one you put on, just be well lubricated and have an open mind. These crazy retro sex comedies actually have a cool soundtrack, enough vibrant tunes to get you to strip off and forget about the films altogether. Worth buying , good transfer quality and sound, Have fun!",1301184000,,337,4.540983606557377
8080440,2,B000AYEIBS,"This is by far the worst of the British sex comedy collections I've suffered through yet. I don' think my index finger came off the fast-forward button during more than 15 minutes of the 3 films.

'Zeta One' was a cross between the 'Austin Powers' franchise and 'Galaxina', a bad early 80's soft-core cure for insomnia that was a stable on Skinemax. Ugh.

'The Yellow Teddybears' gave me the creeps - it's about a group of young schoolgirls who discover boys and big trouble when they start a sex competition among themselves. They're too young to be viewed as sexual entities, IMHO. And there's very little lurid stuff - both a blessing and a curse. Double Ugh.

Then we go backstage at a famous wartime girlie club, and discover the anything but tantalizing 'Secrets Of A Windmill Girl', which allegedly reveals the scandalous truth of the showgirl lifestyle. A major drag from start to finish. But it will send you to sleep when the drugs just won't.

Avoid this set completely and pick up 'The Naughty British Collection' instead - 3 sleazy, cheezy, breezy films that might actually keep you away from the fast-forward button-a-go-go marathon here.",1284076800,4,1152,4.83248730964467
8080441,3,B000AYEIBS,"Set in swinging London, the provocative films in this three-pack feature a decidedly 1960s vibe. ZETA ONE: This Sexploitation flick from the swinging London era is just the sort of sexy kitsch that AUSTIN POWERS so accurately spoofed. Directed by the cult filmmaker Michael Cort, ZETA ONE is based on a story from a magazine of the era called ZETA. Special Agent James Word is embroiled in an investigation of a race of voluptuous super-bombshells led by a zaftig sexpot called Zeta. The beauty abducts pretty young women from Earth and brainwashes them into wearing next to nothing and aiding her in her desire to take over the world. YELLOW TEDDYBEARS: Each member of a schoolgirl club decides to wear a small yellow teddybear pin every time they lose their virginity. The drama unfolds as the leader of the gang thinks she has become pregnant by her local window cleaner boyfriend. She has nowhere to turn for help, and to make matters worse a teacher at the school has discovered the significance of the yellow teddybears. SECRETS OF A WINDMILL GIRL: London's historic Windmill Theater became famous as the only London establishment that stayed open throughout the WWII Blitz. at the time it offered live entertainment that mixed comedy with semi-nude burlesque dancing. SECRETS OF A WINDMILL GIRL captures the excitement of London in the mid-60s, while telling the tale of the brutal demise of Windmill's star performer from the perspective of her best friend. All of the stage scenes use the theater's real dancers to give viewers a taste of what the Windmill was like way back when.",1128902400,20,1589,4.910780669144981
