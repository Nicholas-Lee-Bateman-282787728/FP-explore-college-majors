7921558,1,B00004RNGH,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1987 production of Alice in Wonderland...
This is the oldest cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland that I have found on Amazon (aside from the Disney installment of course). Since this is the first animated cartoon entry to ""The Alice Reviews"", and since this first contender is not a particularly strong installment of the Alice story, it seems a good place to provide a synopsis of a few alternatives at the end of this review. (there used to be a DVD listing for this title but no more).

This entry, `Alice: Through the Looking Glass' is voiced by Janet Waldo, who is famous for voicing many many animated characters, including Judy Jetson of `The Jetsons', and Josie of `Josie and the Pussycats'. Janet Waldo had first voiced Alice in the 1966 Hanna-Barbera cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland. She was 42 at the time. Janet came back for this sequel 21 years later to once again voice Alice at the age of 63. Wow! Is this a record for a performer ""playing"" Alice?

Having said all that, it should be noted that both these installments of the Alice story are spun well away from the content of the books and have in fact been ""Hanna-Barberized"", in that both cartons have been injected with Hanna-Barbera memes. The 1966 version includes an appearance by Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. This 1987 version, which was produced by Burbank Studios (the renamed Hanna-Barbera Studios), had a character unknown to me written in as a companion for Alice as she moves across the chessboard in Looking Glass. They also took liberties such as giving Alice a dog rather than a cat, and rendering the Mad Hatter as a woman. All that's fine and fun of course, and young children should love both installments, but for those interested in introducing their kids to a cartoon more closely resembling the original story, you can do much better. Here is a quick synopsis of a few I have seen:

- The 1951 Disney version, although occasionally criticized for not following Lewis Carroll's book, is in my view a masterpiece regardless. Walt Disney included several elements from `Through the Looking Glass' into the Alice in Wonderland story, but I think it would be a crime to not expose this production to children, which catches Disney Studios at the height of its creative output.

- On my short list for the best way to introduce kids to Alice is a little gem from Cinematronics produced quite recently. These folks located a 1948 radio broadcast of Alice in Wonderland performed by singer Dinah Shore. They combined the recording with some unconventional but brilliant animation techniques and came up with a truly great cartoon Alice. You MUST see this one (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-In-Wonderland/dp/B002WNU0SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice In Wonderland</a>).

- A 1988 cartoon of Alice is worth mentioning because it sticks to the original story rather well. It is listed numerous times on Amazon with different jackets and descriptions... to the point of confusion. A review of this 1988 production and a list of all duplicate entries is here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Nutech-Digital/dp/B00003CWIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Nutech Digital)</a>.

- Another good animated Alice is a 1995 installment voiced by Toni Ail. It sticks better to Lewis Carroll's story than most other kid animations and includes a segment from the book rarely if ever seen on video. It is reviewed here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Jetlag-Productions/dp/B00006RCMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Jetlag Productions)</a>.

- 1981 Funky fables. This production is not listed on Amazon but is most certainly noteworthy. It's a jokey, tongue in cheek version that is as much for Adults as anyone. Funky Fables specialized in comedic takeoffs on traditional children's stories set in modern times. Besides the humor, you have Alice becoming two people in order to have a two-way conversation with herself. The table in the hall of doors is the first one I've seen made 100% out of glass, which corresponds to Carroll's description. And be sure to note what famous singer the playing cards painting the roses red sound like. Google ""alice in wonderland Funky fables"" for the cartoon on YouTube.

It didn't stick to the story very well, I can say, but it was entertaining for a little girl such as the little girl I was. I especially liked the reference to Easter Island's heads. I can't say I really liked the movie much, because I didn't like Alice much, or any of the characters apart from the littlest monster (can't remember name). I found Alice kind of babyish, always saying ""I want to be a queen"" over and over. I did love Square Two and the scene on the train with the paper man and the horse and etc.",1241049600,,655,4.2063492063492065
