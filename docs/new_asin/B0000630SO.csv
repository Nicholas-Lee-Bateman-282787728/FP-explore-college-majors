1686685,4,B0000630SO,"This movie isn't horrible but also isn't great BUT it is above average in my opinion.
If you liked the first Skulls then you have to rent this one just to see the sequel.
The ever so sexy Ashley Lyn Cafagna does a decent acting job in this one along side Dunne.
You can't expect another Jackson, Walker, Bibbe cast can you?
Definately worth the [money] to rent it.  As far as owning it, rent it first, then decide on a purchase.",1019433600,4,428,4.219512195121951
1686686,4,B0000630SO,"I was browsing through my rental place when I saw this dvd and decided to pick this up. The first Skulls had a good premise and a great cast (the ultra hot Leslie Bibb a extra plus to it) but this review isn't about that movie its about the sequel. The Skulls 2 has the same basic premise as the first one. Guy joins Skulls, guy sees wrong-doings by Skull members, guy gets set up by the Skulls, guy uses smarts to outwit Skull members all the while getting the girl. I hope I didn't spoil the movie for anyone by revealing the good guy winning. Like it would happen any other way anyways. This straight to video movie has an above average production and a nice cast. Robin Dunne is a good actor although I see him more as a tv actor than a movie actor. The pacing of the movie was great all the way until the end, which didn't seem like a climax to the film to me. More as if it just happened and then the film stopped. Secondary charecters which are prominant in the beginning have little to do with the end. All in all a good rental. See it if you liked the first one.",1017964800,10,1071,4.080568720379147

1686734,2,B0000630SO,"The Skulls Trilogy gives us two discs containing the original film The Skulls(released Mar/00)on one,with Joshua Jackson as Lucas McNamara,Paul Walker as Caleb Mandrake,Hill Harper as Will Beckford,Leslie Bibb as Chloe Whitfield,Christopher McDonald as Martin Lombard,Steve Harris as Detective Sparrow,William Petersen as Senator Ames Levritt,Craig T. Nelson as Judge Litten Mandrake and others. Also there is Skulls 2(released April/02) with Robin Dunne,Ashley Cafagna-Tesoro,Nathan West,Lindy Booth and James Gallanders. The Skulls 3(released Mar/04)has Clare Kramer as Taylor Brooks,Bryce Johnson as Roger Lloyd,Barry Bostwick as Nathan Lloyd,Steve Braun as Brian Kelly,Karl Pruner as Martin Brooks,Dean McDermott as Det. Staynor,Maria del Mar as Det. Valdez,and Len Cariou as Dean Lawton. All three films were shot in and around Toronto,with the old U of T campus being prominent throughout.
The synopses of all three are basically the same. Some Ivy League and privileged students are tapped by a secret organization called the Skulls,to come join their club. However once a Skull,always a Skull;""a Skull above all others"".Each film begins either right off or soon into the film,with the initiation of the tapped member(s).Eventually something will occur to make the newest member balk at their new found status,such as an initiation gone wrong and someone ending up dead. The Skulls usually take care of their own problems internally,but the protagonist is confused and conflicted;should he tell the police and risk getting kicked out of the Skulls or not?And can one trust the police as the locals have Skulls members within the police ranks? Of course we watch as the lead character wrestles with their conscience and in the end does the right thing. Skulls 3 even bows to the women's lib movement by having a woman challenge the Skulls rules to get herself initiated. Her father is also a Skull and his son,her brother,got killed during the Skull initiation(!).
It is all pretty patented,same old,same old stuff. The first movie had the best cast,but I found not necessarily the best film. All three are professionally done works and directed well,but the plots do not grab me in any sense of the word. I think this is the result of two things:a)The film is about privileged kids,and if you're going to do a film about those that have the world by the squirrely worlys,then you better have a hook to keep me interested;and none of these films have that,and b)there is no ultimate resolution to any of the films. Sure some individual Skull members get taken down and away,but in the end,this dysfunctional organization still stands to commit some other future criminal act. We could have Skulls ad infinitum if there was enough money in someone's very deep pockets to do it. But they would end up just as boring and unsatisfying as these,so why bother?
Technically speaking the films are in their original a/r of 1:78:1 and clear and crisp. There are a few extras on the first disc but the 2nd disc with the 2nd and 3rd installments don't have any.
All in all three quite ordinary and pedestrian films. There is nothing in any of these films to get excited about and nothing to hold your interest one iota. Give them a pass.",1365552000,,3232,5.1

Secondly, with a minor exception of the original, the movies aren't really that good. I won't go into any details on the stories.

1686742,5,B0000630SO,"I would agree that the content of all three do seem repetitive to a degree but that does not mean these movies are not good. The acclaimed television episodes of ""Murder She Wrote"" were always about Murder because that was what the series was suppose to be about. Skulls is about manipulation, deception, money greed and power, and ultimately a New World Order. The acting is good, the story lines are logical and follow the realistic conclusions of being in such a world. My only disappointment is that it has not gone to Blueray. And those reviewers who think Skulls is all about a college fraternity gone bad I have this to say to them.  The New World Order is not just a college prank! There are secret societies that operate behind the scenes, and Skull and Bones is one of them. It is the way future political candidates and religious leaders are groomed into thinking and believing as do those of the elite in the New World Order. It is a very dangerous and influential group.",1331510400,,983,4.553672316384181

1686750,2,B0000630SO,"If you've seen THE SKULLS, the first in this suspense trilogy, then you won't find too much new in this second entry.  Once again, a naively innocent young man seeks initiation into this supersecret clan of collegiate powerhouses who demand secrecy in all they do.  When a young girl is accidentally murdered and the crime covered up, our hero steps up to expose the organization, but not without resistance from the group.  There's not a whole lot of suspense generated, with the outcome fairly predictable.  Robin Dunne doesn't have the charismatic presence to command the movie and the supporting players don't fare much better, although Lindy Booth does well in the role of the innocent Kelly.  This direct to video did well enough, though, that it spawned a third entry, this one with a girl trying to infiltrate the group.",1131062400,2,828,4.885714285714286
1686751,1,B0000630SO,"So, where should I go with this one?  I am pretty sure that most can realize how bad of a film this was without needing me to spell it out for you, but then some of us do need guides, so here it goes.  The Skulls II is a classic example of a movie company trying to monopolize on the semi-success of the original.  Using the rules of low-budget sequel making, they get lesser-known actors to replace the better known actors from the original.  They repeat several select scenes that resemble the original so that the audience doesn't get confused, while all the while continuing with a similar story from the original.  At first glance, you may not realize that there is a difference between these two films outside of the grade D actors that are trying to make a name for themselves.  When will Hollywood realize that they need to stop doing this?  The original Skulls film was not a box-office sensation, so why suck even more money from an already dried well?  Then to see that there is already another film released for those of us that are foaming at the mouth to get more of this secret society makes me sick.  Why Hollywood, why?

Let me begin by getting the shredder out.  The acting was horrible.  I mean, I have seen some bad acting in many of the films that I have seen over the years, but that done by Robin Dunne and Nathan West was despicable.  It was obvious from the opening sequence that they were more excited about being in a film than the overall quality of the film.  This was not a good sign.  The only successful task that these young actors did for me was taking me from minute zero to minute ninety-eight.  The progressed the film, if that is what you want to call it.  Of course, how can you act if you are handed shoddy material anyway?  None of these characters were developed or better yet underdeveloped.  I would have been happier with underdeveloped characters because I could have blamed the writers, but instead I have found that both are to blame.  For lack of a better word, the actors in this film were lazy.  They accepted bad parts for money, and that is never a way to boost your career.  If you have noticed, these guys haven't gone further with their jobs, and I would be blaming this film if I were them for their lack of good employment.

Another aspect to toss in the shredder is the concept of continuity.  When one directs a film, you must possess within your bag of goodness the ability to move the characters from point A to point B fluently.  For those of you that have seen this film, you will probably agree with me that director Joe Chappelle did not have this talent.  There were so many holes in this story that he tried to fill with scenes from the original that forced Chappelle to shoot himself in the foot.  I could not get involved with the plot of this film because one moment the organization was doing something, and the next they were doing something completely the opposite.  Perhaps it was the laziness of the characters that opened these holes, but we cannot leave out Chappelle.  He should have pushed his team further and used his leadership abilities.  I have spoken before that I felt as if the actors were there to collect a paycheck and jump-start their careers, I feel the same about Joe Chappelle.  Could he not see the overall awfulness of this film?  When did he finally look at the finished product and say, ""We have an Oscar winner here!""  If he said this, then I would question Chappelle's ability to direct.

Finally, I would like to make a quick comment about the use of CGI in this film.  For those of you who have seen this horrible, horrible film, you probably missed it because of the burning sensation coming from your eyes.  It says something about a film when the only use of CGI is on a trashcan.  A trashcan being hurled towards a person is a waste of studio money and viewers patience.  I laughed hysterically when I saw this because I could see Chappelle getting excited about this scene.  What kind of damage could a plastic trash can do to anyone?  It is a tough question, and I am thankful that hard-earned money went towards the creation of this piece of cinematic history.

Overall, I have had enough about this organization.  For this series to continue, the creators, directors, or film studios will have to completely break the norm and go out on a limb.  As I can see from the next one it looks like they have a woman that wants to join the organization.  That is not the limb that I am talking about.  This (now trilogy) was failed from the beginning, yet the Hollywood recycle factor chose to release it over and over again.  It was sad to see these actors and director fail, but it should have been obvious from the beginning when they were handed the direct-to-video release script for The Skulls II.  I encourage you to avoid this film at all costs.  There is nothing redeemable in it at all.

1686752,2,B0000630SO,"The ""Skulls"" premise, based on well-established rumors and reports about Yale University's Skull & Bones Order, is a useful basis for a suspense movie.  The 1st film was solid and featured quality actors and direction.  This sequel has none of the same cast and was straight to video.  It basically repeats the same plot theme of the 1st movie.  This movie tries to be more racy than the first yet has weaker drama and dialogue.  It was disappointing - perhaps someone will make a film about the real ""Skulls"" which would be MUCH more dark and suspenseful than the fictional ""Skulls.""",1086825600,9,584,4.742574257425742

You have a story about a secret society, one of the most powerful in the world, and instead of developing that plot, it looked as though this was a skit on Saturday Night Live making fun of the story itself.  The acting was particularly poor and it was hard to have a strong level of empathy with any of the characters.  Not one stands out.  All the characters appear shady, dark, depressing, and yet, it is quite clear that not all of the characters deserved this trait.  We didn't really learn that much about the secret society (other than it likes to keep secrets) and the school the students were attending.  Where is it?  Yale, I presume; but there is little discussion on what the students are like who aren't in the secret society.

The movie goes nowhere fast.  With a plot as transparent as cellophane and a solidly second-string cast (couldn't they afford ANYONE we have heard of), the movie wastes our time with some serious implausibilities spliced together with laughable dialogue and a downright silly ending.
Did the producers really think that this film covered any new territory that the first missed?  It seems that both are based on the same book.

7958116,1,B0000630SO,"I watched the first 6 minutes. Not worth it. The opening is odd and then automatically it goes to the bedroom. I stopped it at that point. They should have stopped with the previous film, IMO.",1505606400,,192,4.361111111111111

7958121,2,B0000630SO,"Compared to the first one, it falls off terribly. I tried watching them back to back. The first one is so good it makes you want to see another. This one is so bad that if you somehow came across it first, you would never want to watch Skulls I. I gave it two stars for the mere fact it was in the family. I will not watch the third.",1481846400,,333,3.7714285714285714
