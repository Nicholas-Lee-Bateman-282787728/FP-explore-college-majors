7809328,2,6301035607,"""Computer Beach Party"" is 1980s cheese at the peak of ripeness. It's basically an excuse to film an ongoing beach party complete with a ridiculous hair band, pretty girls, and a geek versus jock conflict that goes nowhere. Here's the quick version: Turk (Rich Brakedale) is a jerk and lifeguard, whose pretty girlfriend Allison (Stacey Nemour) is the daughter of the corrupt mayor. Allison for no reason ever explained takes a shine to computer nerd Andy (Hank Amico) who has figured out that mayor and Turk are conspiring to buy the public beach because he thinks there's treasure from an old shipwreck buried there. Whatever. It doesn't make any difference; it's just a contrivance to show the girls and the band. There is little coherence here: there's a recurring piece about the ""Chicken Car"" (a car with a giant chicken mounted on the roof for some reason), and the bumbling cop that's after it; there's a bit about Andy's computer and its relevance to auto mechanics (don't ask), and in my favorite digression, a field trip to NASA down in Houston because they might have treasure maps derived from photos taken by astronauts. They don't, but the trip isn't wasted as they go to Gilley's where there music and a horribly out of sync soundtrack. Eventually Allison shames her dad for his attempted annexation, Turk falls out of favor, and Andy becomes cool thanks to his computerized drag racer. Then the film ends.

I guess the film has a detectable story arc, feeble as it may be, but it detours all over the place and is way too long. The acting is bottom of the barrel, though the script is even worse. I gave this two stars due to its status as a time capsule of the type of cheesiness that could only come from the 1980s. Besides, it has a Chicken Car.",1510531200,,1764,4.635782747603834

It was released right at the time when everyone thought computers were magic as demonstrated by this film. In Computer Beach Party our heroes can order a party via an Apple ][ and make a car go faster by...ummmm, yeah I don't know. This flick has all the proper ingredients to make it an enjoyable bad movie to watch with friends after downing a few potent potables.",1444435200,,445,4.373493975903615
