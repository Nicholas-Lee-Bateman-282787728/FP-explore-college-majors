8217907,1,B000VB4ZT0,Bought this for my father not knowing I needed a U.K. DVD PLAYER. Unable to play it in the U.S.,1504915200,,95,3.8
8217908,1,B000VB4ZT0,It's made for UK audiences and is difficult if not impossible to play on US systems.,1440806400,,84,4.3125
8217909,5,B000VB4ZT0,"I'm thrilled to have this. Yes it is non US region 2, I have a non region player, so this is ok. That being said, it is wonderful to see a collection that adds many missing gaps to the US 1&2 collections. BUT.....All of the movies on this that were not available on the US collections 1& 2 are more or less now available on US single DVD releases now in 2015.

I'm still happy to have this collection as it's nice to have all these in one box. Highly recommended for those that can play non US region DVD's.

17 films in  one box, all WC Fields! This is a no brainer for me.

 I'd love to see a full box set of ALL WC Fields, even the bit part movies, IMO he is important enough for that, and make it blu ray!!!!

Where is Her Majesty Love? Running Wild, Sally of the Sawdust, It's The Old Army Game, Song of the Open Road or Sensations of 1945 on officialDVD or blu ray releases????  We have NO WC Fields on blu ray at all !!! WHY???  At least give us The Bank Dick on blu ray Criterion!!!

Folks that care need to make enough noise that hopefully something happens.",1428969600,3,1067,4.042857142857143

8217912,5,B000VB4ZT0,"A very good comprehensive collection of WC Fields films. Some of them not available on other collections. The only caveat is that the DVD is Region 2. Therefore you MUST have a DVD player that is capable of playing DVDs from  Region 2. Most US DVD players play only Region 1 DVDs. However if you have a multi-regional DVD player, (many available online)  this is a great buy!",1388016000,6,375,4.5
8217913,1,B000VB4ZT0,"Do Not buy this DVD set. It will not play on dvd recorders in America. I found out the play2,4,&5 codes, are for other counties. It cost me alot of money to try to send it back for refund in EU and it was sent back to meStay away from this one its a ripoff",1365984000,2,256,3.672727272727273
8217914,5,B000VB4ZT0,"This is quite simply the most comprehensive collection of W. C. Fields' films ever packaged. First released by Universal five years ago, this 10-disc collection has seventeen Fields classics, including ""Million Dollar Legs,"" ""If I Had a Million,"" ""Tillie and Gus,"" ""Mississippi,"" ""The Big Broadcast of 1938,"" and ""Six of a Kind""--none of which are contained in either volume one or two of the W. C. Fields Comedy Collections.

As a serious collector of Fields' films on dvd--I already own the aforementioned Comedy Collections--I'm aware of the films missing from my collection and would eagerly purchase any box set that contains them. Unfortunately, these are Region 2 DVDs! Make no mistake; these are official Universal Studio releases. However, this collection was manufactured exclusively for a European market. These discs will not be compatible with U.S. DVD players.

Why is Europe getting preferential treatment when it comes to these classic films? The same was true with Laurel and Hardy's Hal Roach classics until the 2011 release of Laurel & Hardy: the Essential Collection.  For years, most of Laurel and Hardy's films were only available in Europe. Let's hope Universal gets the message and makes these titles available domestically real soon.",1351296000,22,1258,5.311557788944723
