of a musical line I don't believe have ever been equaled.  This is a memorable (even thrilling ) example of his
legacy.",1502150400,,236,5.184210526315789
8036270,5,B0004Z3526,"I saw most of the Voice of Firestone programs when I was very young. Then in 1956 and 1957 I saw and heard him at the Acadmey of Music in Philadelphia. Both programs were wonderful. He sang Nesun Dorma in the concert and little did we know that he was recording Turandot at the time. The quality in person was beyond belief. To this day all new tenors I see or hear must measure up to Jussi. The last selection in the concert was E lucan e Stella, Tosca last act. When I asked him personally how did he get the piano so perfect. His response was after 35 years it comes easy. Nothing like him and I even have the 78 records he made in the 1930's.

8036271,4,B0004Z3526,"This is an interesting DVD. The first review was absolutely on target. This DVD is a nice document of the Firestone broadcasts but there are much better ways to introduce yourself to Bjorling. Many opera fans include Bjorling in there very short list of the most beautiful recorded tenor voices. Unfortunately the color of his voice is difficult to fully appreciate from this DVD.  I would also recommend the RCA The Ultimate Collection as a good way to introduce yourself  the beauty and uniqueness of Bjorling's voice. After that the commercial  complete recordings of Puccini's Boheme, Manon Lescaut,  and Turandot. There are also commercial recordings of Verdi's Rigoletto and Trovatore. They will also give you a chance to hear the sopranos De Los Angeles, Albanese, Milanov, Peters,Nilsson and Tebaldi. If you become addicted to his voice, there are several excellent broadcasts now available through the Met Opera and Sony. This includes Verdi's Masked Ball and Rigoletto. There is also a Gounod's Romeo and Juliet with Sayao. With a little more searching among pirate labels and MP-3 downloads you can find broadcasts of Verdi's Don Carlo and  and Gounod's Faust. For real addicts additional broadcasts and recordings can be found.",1413590400,,1239,5.206030150753769
8036272,5,B0004Z3526,Jussi Bjorling could never sing badly and this CD proves it.,1410912000,,60,4.545454545454546
8036273,2,B0004Z3526,Very low quality of sound and picture also very litle Bjoerling and a lot of his wife and orchestal music. I don't recommend this DVD to anybody.,1391817600,,145,4.407407407407407
8036274,5,B0004Z3526,"This DVD of the late Jussi Bjorling only verifies what I already knew - that the singer was the best tenor of the twentieth century and, perhaps, at any time during the last two-hundred years - only my opinion, but I think thousands would agree.  It worries me that I might wear  this DVD out from over-use.  The staging could have been greatly improved upon as it is inclined to be stultified and unprofessional.  Still, I am very happy to possess it.",1378252800,2,452,4.475609756097561
8036275,5,B0004Z3526,"It is a terrible shame that the recordings of that time period were so poorly documented, their are bits and pieces of the true beauty of his voice , but, I am happy to have it.",1369267200,,177,3.9444444444444446
8036276,5,B0004Z3526,I am very happy with this  purchase.  The seller shipped immediately and Item was received ahead of schedule.  Jussi Bjorling  is a great tenor from the 40s and 50s who died way too young!  I would purchase from this seller again.,1369094400,,230,4.512195121951219
8036277,5,B0004Z3526,You hear Bjorling's voice and of course you think that its amazing. Vocal performances like these really have to be seen to be believed. Can a human being really make these sounds? And then you see him sing in this program  and still it seems hard to accept that anyone could be this good. When the music requires dramatic singing he's totally convincing. When the demands are lyrical he is near perfection. Jussi is quite animated when he sings and not at all stoic. He even wears what looks like Caruso's Canio costume for the Pagliacci aria. It was lovely to see him sing the Boheme duet with his wife who was herself quite good.,1326585600,5,632,4.495652173913044
8036278,5,B0004Z3526,"My voice teacher is a big fan of Jussi Bjoerling (sorry-don't know how to put an umlaut) and he can't stop talking about Jussi's (and Caruso's) vocal technique.  I am a tenor in training at Cal State Fullerton and my teacher is teaching me the vocal techniques of Jussi Bjoerling and Enrico Caruso.  When I got this DVD, I didn't know what Jussi looked like singing, which is a good indicator to see how easy the sound production of a singer can make by looking at his/her face for signs of effort.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  Jussi definitely (of all the tenors I've seen [pretty much all the greats from Caruso on]) has the least amount of effort of them all and, though debatable, the most beautiful voice of them all as well.  Struggle is pretty much non-existent in his face and the sound that comes out is rich and carries easy.  His high notes, as compared to his lower notes, look almost the same facially.  If you want a tool to see how efficient the human voice can be, and sing, Jussi Bjoerling's voice is probably the best you can get (watch the track ""Salut, demeure chaste pure"" and you will get the idea).

Though his acting is not up to par with today's opera singers (which is a big emphasis in opera these days) his voice almost makes up for it in the musicality.  This is NO reference DVD, as the video and audio show it's age from the source it was recorded.  This is more for reference for singers and not DVD buffs.  Jussi's voice (and Technique) were unique and there aren't voices like his anymore.  I recommend the RCA Red Seal ""Jussi Bjorling: The Ultimate Collection,"" the best remastering and faithful to Jussi's voice(1999) and ""Jussi Bjorling reDiscovered"" (2003) to hear Jussi in a live setting at Carnegie Hall back in 1955.",1104192000,39,1750,4.503164556962025
