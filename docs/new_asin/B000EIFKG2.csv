SHIRLEY WAS WITH THEM AT THAT TIME AND A FEW MORE THAT ARE NOT THERE NOW. THEY DID THE SECOND TOUR IN D.C.TO A FULL HOUSE THAT WAS ON THEIR FEET THE INTIRE TIME. THEY ALL LOOKED GOOD AND SOUNDED BETTER THAN EVER. STILL STRONG VOICES AND BRING DOWN THE HOUSE. THE SONG REMEMBER ME WAS THE BLAST FOR ME. DOROTHY NORWOOD REALLY LOOKS GREAT. ABATINA WALKER WAS IN A WHEEL CHAIR THAT NIGHT, BUT IT DID'NT CRAMP HER STYLE. BUY THE CD YOU'LL REALLY ENJOY IT.  LZCOOPER",1168819200,4,631,4.214876033057851
2521559,5,B000EIFKG2,The collection is awsome for anyone who loves Traditional Gospel Music. The Caravans are as vibrant as ever. I would rate this 10 stars if I could.,1155945600,4,147,4.481481481481482
2521560,5,B000EIFKG2,"This is just awesome!!!  If you're a traditional Gospel music lover, it's something that you have been dreaming of. You need to get this set. One of the highlights of this project is the reunion of the Caravans. After each member went solo, they have gotten together to sing for one of the other member's concert but somebody was always missing. However, in this particular recording, Albertina Walker, Dorothy Norwood, Shirley Caesar, Inez Andrews and Delores Washington are all called to sing the music of the Lord again: Lord Keep Me Day By Day - Mary Don't You Weep - Sweeping Thru The City. Besides the Caravans, you will surely be amazed by gospel's all time favorite numbers performed by the big names of the industry.  The interview segments between the songs are very interesting as well.  Matt T.-Tokyo, Japan",1140912000,11,819,4.835714285714285
