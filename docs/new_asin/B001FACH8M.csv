It is about time we make fun of the most left wing radical nonsense people out there and I really think it is a great way to do it with a lot of fun and not all serious attacks. RIGHT ON AND VERY VERY FUNNY. A must see for any right wing person that does not believe in all the left wing radical nonsense, you will get a good laugh and see you are not alone out there.",1227225600,6,530,3.6991150442477876

3566332,5,B001FACH8M,"If your view of America goes beyond the divisive politics of the past two decades, you'll love ""An American Carol.""  You'll also laugh, and you may shed a tear or two.

David Zucker and the cast of the film clearly love America and the ideals upon which the country was founded and built.  Using Charles Dickens' famous story as the conceptual framework, ""An American Carol"" similarly clears away the invented trappings of political extremism to reawaken the underlying theme of patriotism.  Along the way, the viewer is shown how different the world and the country might have been had the defenders of freedom, from Washington to Kennedy, failed to act as they did.

Unlike previous Zucker films, ""An American Carol"" is much more than a continuous stream of jokes and sight gags, although there is certainly no lack of either.  In ""An American Carol,"" Zucker demonstrates a talent for pacing which sets the humor in a historic and political context which makes this much more than just a very funny film.",1226707200,15,1006,4.853801169590644
3566333,5,B001FACH8M,"The Amazon review above is an excellent example of why this movie wasn't reviewed by the critics who all tend to be very left leaning. Simply, it would have been grossly panned by them. I liked the movie very much. As a matter of fact, the audience in the theatre was laughing hysterically throughout most of the movie. I had tears in my eyes from laughing too hard! Yes, it had a couple of slow moments, as every movie does. It is both entertaining and refreshing compared to the liberal mantra thats usually presented.  Seeing a movie that leans to the right, and sends a few zings to the left was a real pleasure.

3566347,5,B001FACH8M,"Let's face it, with the exception of Fox News and talk radio, virtually all the media in the West is left-wing, including Hollywood. This movie was kind-of funny, but its value lies in educating the public about what the Right believes.

If you're a leftist, you should watch this movie in order to know what the right thinks of you. The truth is that most leftists aren't objective, since they're rarely exposed to right-wing arguments. That's why leftists should take some time into getting to know the other side (if they already haven't of course).

The right is bombarded with leftist ideas everywhere, in the media, in government, in business and in education. The left lives in a much bigger bubble than the right. The left is almost never bombarded with right-wing ideas.",1447286400,,779,4.849624060150376

3566352,5,B001FACH8M,"I agree with the reviewer who said the ACLU zombie lawyers' scene was fabulous. It was. Not sure if the college crowd heard the final spoken sequence. Anyway, the bottom line is that the ACLU has a written agreement with EVERY Teacher's Union in America. What it says is that your teachers, including your college professors, can LIE TO YOU and the ACLU will make sure nothing will be done about it..

The ACLU will defend any teacher, including college professors, who willfully with full knowledge aforethought LIE to their own students. Period. It doesn't matter if the charge is civil or criminal. Doesn't matter if the charge or complaint is for fraud, failure to perform a contractual obligation, or any other type of criminal offense or tort action for damages. The ACLU will defend your teacher FOR FREE. Why? Because the 1st Amendment says your teacher has the right to free speech. Unless the college requires their teachers to waive their right to free speech (which none of them do), the ACLU says your teacher has a Constitutional Right to LIE TO YOU.

Which brings us to the scene at Columbia University, where the college professors are bragging that they can leave out HISTORICAL FACTS and deliberately mislead or lie to their students because they have ""tenure"". As I said above, that isn't their only protection. The ACLU is standing right behind them in case they are caught in a deliberate lie.",1440460800,,1414,4.814814814814815

I W=A=N=T=E=D to like this movie. The stars are capable; the soundtrack; makeup and SFX were excellent.
The Zucker brothers have entertained me for MANY years.... but this was NOT ""Airplane"", nor, ""The Naked Gun"".
I should rate this a ONE[star]. But, I gave it a two because of two reasons:
a.) It cost [way] less than $5 (and a Blu-ray[!] at that).
b.) The d-e-l-e-t-e-d scenes are better than the theatrical release*.

The ""Michael Moore"" dumb/fat/ugly jokes came fast and often, but are as funny as thrown cream pie misses. If the
83 minute movie---which SEEMED like two-hours---had all the jokes that failed cut out, and the deleted scenes put
back in... it'd've been 23-minutes----and far from perfect----but, MORE like the European release's title, which is:
''A  BIG, FAT, IMPORTANT, MOVIE''. ""An American Carol"" is a failure that insults Charles Dickens, and has absolutely
NOTHING to do with Christmas.

In short, an anti-liberal misfire that even [we] Republicans will wince at. I want my 83-minutes back!
_________________________________________________________________________________________
*= A deleted scene has Ted Kennedy [alive at the time] talking to [the ghost of his brother] JFK. Ted has a car
behind him full of water and fish [Chappaquiddick] and asks John if he'd like a lift. JFK says ""I'd rather take my
chances and rid a limo."" {That IS pretty sick, eh? But, f-a-r ""funnier"" than what was NOT cut out.}

3566374,1,B001FACH8M,"Unlike most of the one-star reviewers here, Im actually conservative, so my review isn't tainted by cynical politics.

I saw An American Carol in the theater years ago, because I was excited to see an explicitly right wing movie, as well as a comedy from the same guy who directed Airplane!, a low-brow classic.  Additionally, this movie has star power, including Kelsey Grammar, Leslie Neilsen, Jon Voigt, Dennis Hopper, and James Woods.

Perhaps my expectations were too high.  There were only two laugh-out-loud moments in the film.  One was early on, involving Cubans rushing to Michael Moores boat as he leaves Cuba for America.  The other was lifted straight form the Onion Movie, which struck me as unoriginal and unprofessional.  Otherwise, the movie plodded along, bogged down by corny humor, including lots of singing and dancing, which seems to be bad comedys favorite format.

Other than more, better jokes, I think the narrative could have been improved by making it less about then-contemporary issues such as the War in Iraq, and more generally about motives that will always be with us long after that war is reduced to a short paragraph in school books.  I know I lambast Zucker for being unoriginal here, but he could do worse than ripping off A Christmas Carols reliance on a timeless theme, only instead of focusing on greed, it would revolve around pride, envy, or wrath, all of which can be readily found in progressive discourse.",1390867200,,1452,4.94238683127572
3566375,1,B001FACH8M,"So I just saw this movie and I honestly had to force myself to sit through the whole thing. Yes I'm a liberal, but I don't let that get in the way of seeing a movie just because it has a right-wing viewpoint. I actually enjoyed Atlas Shrugged 1 and 2, and I'm looking forward to the 3rd (though I'd rate both 3 stars at best).

Back to the point: This was not a great film. It was not a good film. You have to really really really hate liberals to enjoy this movie, and even then I doubt you'd find most of the material that funny. The jokes were predictable and bordering on sad. The liberal strawmen presented were so out of this world it was hard to tell whether this was actually making fun of right-wing conservatives who actually believe liberals think that way.

If you're an extreme right-winger this was probably enough to convince you that the movie belongs in the top 10 of all time, but for everyone else don't waste your money.",1389398400,,940,4.305084745762712
3566376,2,B001FACH8M,"I really wanted to like this movie, specially because of the director's previous work, but it fell way short from its mark. Too sad, cause there was a lot of potential for laughter. All the jokes here fell flat. That's why movie-making should be left to the liberals, extremist and closeted republicans. The constant dumbing and attacks of the documentarian, we there not say his name, could have been more clever, yet the personal attacks were concentrated on his physical attributes weight, looks etc. Towards the middle it started getting so slow and hapless I saw myself dosing off. I liked Airplane and Scary Movie and one can only hope his next picture will be as funny and comically engaging as his previous work.",1376352000,,720,4.814516129032258

there are actually 2 skits within the movie that were kind of funny. a ""goofus and gallant"" take on a good terrorist/bad terrorist scenario featuring Akbar and ahmed comes early in the movie. later, a spoof of a ""liberal"" documentary featuring Christian terrorists is humorous and actually makes a point without upending everything that rational people know about logic and history. laughing un-derisively at almost anything else in this movie, however, requires some advanced and highly partisan brain disease.
kevin Farley pulls off some lesser-talented brother slapstick schtick about 10% of his onscreen time. otherwise, they either shot every scene in one take to slap this mess out there, or the writing is as bad and kevin is as untalented as you suspected. jon voight actually pulls off a decent George Washington. dennis hopper is dennis hopper. david alan grier tries to bring it, but the ""it"" is all his personality, and the script is too awful to overcome. everyone else is awful on top of having an awful script to work with. a double helping of awfulness - like co-stars Kelsey grammar and his (most recent?)ex.
if you are a lefty with a good sense of humor, there are plenty of laughs at the expense of the reality challenged and the historically unaware who eat this stuff up. if you like the daily show and Colbert report, you might enjoy this. prepare to laugh, and make sure there is no one within range of a good spit-take - I've purposely left out spoilers of how truly stupid this thing gets. there will be a couple of cringeworthy times you will have to run out of the room so as not to give up all hope on humanity. those are good times to grab another beer from the fridge.

3566386,3,B001FACH8M,"Okay, so this is not the greatest movie ever made.  It did not win an Academy Award.  It is not in the IMDB Top 250 (receiving a mere 4.3 rating out of 10).  Rotten Tomatoes gives it an abysmal 11%.  Most critics did not think it funny.  Maybe I'm the only guy on the planet, but I found American Carol to be hilarious.

Part of my willingness to forgive the lower-than-par production value was my sense of delight at finding someone who understands how we feel--those of us who are part of the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country.  We are increasingly marginalized by the liberal media, treated as stereotypical hypocrites by Hollywood, and snubbed in the halls of higher learning.  The fact that it came from David Zucker of Airplane fame rather than a fellow Christian makes it all the more gratifying.

The basic premise of the film is that a documentary filmmaker named Michael Malone (an obvious parody of Michael Moore) is seeking to ban the Fourth of July, while Islamic terrorists are trying to blow up Madison Square Garden.  Malone has a Dickensesque experience and is visited by three ghosts of America past--Patton, Washington and the Angel of Death.  Along the way, Zucker irrevererntly pokes fun at Islamofascism, the liberal media, liberal higher education, the ACLU and, most of all, Michael Moore (played by Kevin Farley).  Cameos by Leslie Nielsen, Kelsey Grammer, Jon Voight, James Woods, Dennis Hopper, Bill O'Reilly, and country singer Trace Adkins as the Angel of Death add to the fun.

Video and audio quality: the blu-ray transfer is fine, although this is not the kind of movie where it matters much.  If you already have the DVD, it is probably not worth upgrading.

Parental warning: While there is no sex or nudity, there are a couple of scenes that border on risque.  Another scene features zombies.  Some mild profanity.

Is this a great movie?  No.  Is it worth watching?  Yes, particularly if you would identify yourself as a conservative.  You should have some laugh-out-loud moments.",1350518400,7,2023,4.870967741935484

The lack of focus and humour in this movie evokes Ed Wood in its style-- it's simply much easier to laugh at it than to laugh with it.  The difference from Ed Wood's style is that this film is not wacky and fun, rather just a jumble of ridiculous stereotypes.  I wanted to like it, since I loved all of the Naked Gun and Airplane films.  In the end, though, it just isn't funny to laugh at needless insults without any comedic value.  Were you one of the bullies in this playground who always picked on others for being different in any way you can imagine?  If yes, then you might like this film.

3566393,1,B001FACH8M,"I applaud director David Zucker for making the movie he obviously wanted to make: an arch conservative satire that ridicules anything remotely perceived as ""liberal,"" such as higher education, health care reform,and anyone who doesn't Love Sarah Palin. It takes a crazy kind of courage to make a film this politically biased in either direction in the desperate Hollywood climate of sanitizing and making movies as politically bland as possible in order to appeal to the greatest number of ticket buyers without offending anyone.

However, when a filmmaker tries to justify not showing his movie to critics because in his view ALL critics are inherently liberal radicals, and then even goes so far as to accuse whole theater chains of switching the ticket purchases from his alleged comic masterpiece to a film with less conservative ideals, you know the film is a bomb, no matter what your party is.

From the Amazon reviews a lot of people would seem to enjoy this outragious satire on Roger Moore. I'm glad they enjoyed a movie, any movie. I love movies. However the facts are An American Carol was lambasted by the vast majority of mainstream critics. I find it hard to believe that the majority of them are left wing fascists. And as for the positive Amazon reviews, they certainly weren't in the theaters when this film only grossed $7,000,000 from a production budget (probably not including advertizing) of $20,000,000. Justifying this loss by blaming innocent clerks and theater managers is not only libelous and irresponsible it's pathetic beyond words. If a film, ANY film is making money, every theater employee wants that film to stay in the theater as long as possible for job security. And 2008 was a bad year financially for all of us.

Whether you enjoy or not enjoy this film is a deeply personal experience. Michael Moore was already a self-parody by 2008, and anyone who does not like him can find ample reasons to laugh at him in some of his own films. For Zucker to make a comic criticism of Moore is akin to someone making a satire about the Three Stooges. The joke is already there in the original conception so it's beating a dead horse.

I saw  Zuckers baby when it was first released on opening weekend, in a packed house of very conservative audience members. In the beginning there was some chuckles from the viewers here and there. However as the film dragged, and dragged is the right word, on the occasional laughing sounds became fewer and fewer till there was dead silence towards the second half of the film. Personally, I was appalled. Not the by conservative agenda, we live in a democratic society, but by the total lack of comic inventiveness, timing or coherent humor. The jokes just splattered on the screen like red pantball smears.",1318809600,8,2774,4.819327731092437

I turned it off within the first five minutes or so. I had already heard a few curse words (one from a young girlscout) and the Lord Jesus Christ was blasphemed. Films like these should never be advertised in connection with creation films. It's sad that our great nation under God allows such irreverence on a regular basis.

3566398,2,B001FACH8M,"An American Carol, 2008 film

The story begins in suburban America. Grandpa cooks hamburgers that hungry children refuse to eat. [A comment on Hollywood?] He tells them a story about ""Scrooge"". We see a scene in Afghanistan with jokes about names. A messenger is sent down a hill. Whose car was it? There are comic references. Can they find a Hollywood director who hates America? Free medicines? A line jumper is dealt with. ""Michael Malone"" makes another documentary. We see a new organization that ""moves along"" [what billionaire pays for it?]. A July 4th barbecue? Will Uncle Mike see his nephew Timmy? ""God Bless America!"" Malone gets the ""Leni Riefenstahl Award"". Opium production in Afghanistan? [The British fought two wars in the 1880s to gain control of this valuable commodity.]

""Scrooge"" gets a visit from a Dead President. ""Don't believe government lies!"" General George S. Patton visits Mike to tell about peace demonstrations in the 1930s. There is a funny parody about Neville Chamberlain, then about the Civil War. Do professors tell students what movies to see? Do they listen? [Aren't professors just corporate flunkies who do what they are told?] Mike remembers Molly. He meets Aziz, an illegal immigrant. Bill O'Reilly interviews Michael Malone. Rosie O'Connell is against profiling and Radical Christians. A suppository bomber? Zombies in the Courthouse? Protect the Ten Commandments? Hijack a subway to attack a building? Mike is transported to a suburban family gathering. Poor crippled children? [Unconscious criticisms about medical care for children?] Next we are in Kandahar. ""Real bullets!"" Is he hopeless?

George Washington lectures Mike about a final judgment. There is a visit to the future. We see Detroit as a wasteland. [What is it really like after twenty years of NAFTA?] Then Mike wakes up. He is called upon to do the right thing at Madison Square Garden. He makes a speech, the audience doesn't like this. Mike learns the truth about Aziz. What will he do? ""Welcome to the real America!"" There is a song by the crowd. Later a family reunion. ""There's a lot of bad people out there."" [Is the Navy in Afghanistan?] What will happen to the family? And so there is a happy ending. ""It's just a story.""

The credits roll. Did you recognize the actors (they are not credited with their characters). While films like ""Airplane"" and its copies are moderately successful, this movie does not seem as good. Movies are entertainment, most people don't want to be preached to or forced to think. Message movies are seldom successful unless the audience agrees with the message in advance. I've seen funnier satires (""Wrongfully Accused"") and better message movies. Wasn't this a flop at the box office? The flaws outnumber the fun.

Michael Moore worked in an automobile assembly plant after he graduated from high school, then moved on to the world of journalism. His movies made him a rich man. Hollywood is controlled by Wall Street financiers; it takes millions of dollars to produce even a documentary. They make money by producing movies that customers will watch. Moore produced many documentaries since the 1990s. His film ""Sicko"" must have caused this angry attack by powerful and rich corporations.

Homer Simpson once commented, ""It's funny, because it's TRUE!!!""

The converse is also true.  I was hoping for some really constructive & sly humor.  Instead in American Carol you have the slandering of Michael Moore by a bunch of people who clearly have either never seen any of his documentaries or lacked the capacity to understand them.  Amazing, because they're not *that* complicated.  Maybe that's still too advanced?  Occasionally I've read Moore's films are effete intellectual drivel intended for academics and hippies.  Here, the allegation is liberals have a simplistic view of the world and history.

Yet in the film we're presented with a wildly simplistic, limited, and short-sighted view in response.  The founders are shown in one-dimensional funda-Christian slant that does not tell the entire history.  John F. Kennedy's personality is based entirely on a book he wrote prior to getting into office and the speeches made very early on.  This gung-ho JFK appears to have been assassinated less than a month after taking office, as his behavior and opinions have not been shaped by the Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, or the greater complexities that shaped what his presidency became.

Hey, isn't that the guy who did the voice-over for those laser sheep political ads?  And Frasier?!  Very sad.

Yes, there were left-wingers who didn't want FDR to enter the War.. What the director fails to mention is that the conservatives were also as adamant about America's isolationism.  They practically tried to hand FDR his rear-end when he was vying to enter the European Theater.  In fact, the Isolationists could have cared less about Hitler, or England and France's acquiescence to Germany over Czechoslovakia.  It wasn't until Japan attacked us and Hitler later declared war on us as well that the Isolationists jumped on board.

Michael Malone's nephews and nieces, all of whom are afflicted with disease, are angry with uncle Michael because he won't pay to have them cured.  ""Blood stained"" money from his anti-American documentaries that he worked so hard for.  Diseases, that are bluntly expressed as not being the concern of the US Government.

The men and women of the US Armed Forces are fighting for our Freedom and the Constitution, say the filmmakers. However, Jon Voight (as George Washington) explains to MM that he ""abuses"" his freedom by making documentaries, which the Angel of Death (Trace Adkins), shows to MM, an Islamicized (sp?) America, as a result of his films, which no one has seen.

The only characters of color with major roles are either Afghan or Arab terrorists and AMERICAN black folk who play slaves. No Ving Rhames playing Fredirick Douglass as the Ghost of Reason here folks.  And yes, Douglas was a Republican/Conservative. Even Robert Davi portrays an Arab/Afghan with a heavily tanned face.

How do you deal with the ACLU when they bring matters before American Court of Justice, to be judge on American legal issues?  Legal issues which were hashed out by our Founding Fathers with a lot of sacrifice, arguing and deep thought?  Ya shoot 'em.

How many of the actors in this movie have ever served in the Military and picked up a gun in defense of our country?  You might say Leslie Nielsen, but, he's a Canuk, so even if he served with the Maple Leafs he doesn't count.  If they're like me, they didn't serve. Instead, they hung around and spent all their money getting wasted and having sex, while kids just out of high school and young adults were being sent into conflicts.

Only country music is for true patriots. Rock stars like Sammy Hagar, Kid Rock and so on...just way too liberal for the ""Real America"".

And, apparently, Americans are so dumb that we as a nation and as a people will allow documentaries, that no one spends money on or sees, to corrupt our minds so deeply that we willingly give up our freedom to live the Sharia kind of life.

Finally:  How come Dennis Miller wasn't in this movie? He could have played a great Jon Voight explaining to MM, his youthful transgressions as a war protesting, dancing, drug ingesting, Hollywooder hating America, Liberal.

The movie is terribly disjointed. It goes from vignette to vignette without any continuity. Potentially funny jokes (the ALCU portrayed as zombies) are so out of context and have no basis in the plot that a great concept is left to die on the vine. Out of nowhere, there's a musical number. FOR NO REASON. And because of the jumping around, the jokes are in no way developed naturally from the plot.

There were two parts that made me genuinely laugh: The terrorist training video at the beginning and the absurd parody of Rosie O'Donnell's anti-Christian zealotry. The terrorist sections of the film work the best, but they are few and far between.

Kevin farley FAR outranks his family gene pool for acting . With few goophy exceptions does a class job of acting . The ""CAROL"" line works well . About every political group is poked and prodded . You will watch it a second time . TRULY too many small scenes and incidents to catch even the first TWO times thru . Look over the actors list ; long and tremendous .
  TOO many to note , but i think my favorite exchange is (farley)""SO now you're against privacy rights?!""  (kelsey grammar)""ONLY when they interfere with SURVIVAL RIGHTS!"" BLAM!!(shotgun- terrorist shot).
  Overall , character Josh , played by an unknown actor, is done to EXCELLENCE . His timing and expressions are perfect, rivaling Kelsey's work . AND  NO ONE fumbles in this movie . ALL great acting and the two young ""jihadists"" that follow thru story line will crack you up .

It wasn't screened for critics, which didn't surprise me since this was being called a ""conservative comedy.""  Critics are untrustworthy enough without the political angle.  It was a later showing but the theatre was very empty for an opening weekend.  It was literally me and some couples from Sun City.

Unfortunately, there just were not enough laughs.  The actors were definitely there, everyone from Robert Davi to Leslie Nielsen to Kelsey Grammer.  Chris Farley's brother has graduated from his funny car rental commercials to carrying an entire movie on his own.  He was really good and I hope to see more of him.  I also really liked James Woods in his cameo.

I loved some of the ideas.  Putting a blowhard like Michael Moore in his place by spoofing his career next to a George Clooney-like clone was excellent--and should give the real Moore a reality check.

I just wish it would've been funnier.  It almost hurts to not be enthusiastic about a movie that has so much good going for it.  The attitude is there, the message is dead-on, the cast is awesome.  Just wish I'd laughed more.

Fatness has nothing to do with his politics, and there are plenty of fat conservatives out there.  I felt it took away from the message of the film to pick on personal appearance rather than actions.

3566437,2,B001FACH8M,"Let me get this out front.  I agree with this movie's ideology, and I thought ""Airplane"" was one of the funniest movies ever.  Thus, this movie was a major disappointment.

First, the question is whether this was supposed to be a comedy that had a message or a message movie that had some humorous points to it.  The movie tried to be both and failed as a total package.  There were scenes that made me laugh out loud but not many.  The comedy was over the top enough (as you would expect from Zucker) that it took away from the message.  My dad told me about a scene before it, and his telling it was funnier than it was in the movie.  (I won't tell you the scene because you might find it funnier if you're not expecting it.)

Second, the question is who this movie is aimed for.  This movie would turn off any liberal (I doubt it's changed anybody's point of view).  This movie has too much language, crude humor, etc. to make it a favorite of a Religious Right person, though they agree with the ideology.  Thus, it would be enjoyed most by a conservative who would pull out a beer as he puts in the DVD and has no problem with vulgarity or cussing.

Third, I am not a fan of juvenalean satire.  For those who aren't familiar with the subject, there are two basic types of satire:  Horatian and Juvenalean.  The former is more good natured, while the other has a bit of a mean streak.  I believe that the ACLU stands more for Anti-Christian Litigation Unit or Antagonist Crazy Loons Unleashed than it does for American Civil Liberties Union, but seeing them cast as zombies did nothing for me.  Also, parodying real people (with characters like documentary maker Michael Malone who looks like a dead ringer for Michael Moore, and an actress named Rosie O'Connell) seemed to be more making fun of the real people.

Fourth, the packaging is misleading.  It has Leslie Nielsen in the forefront of the five actors.  He may be the biggest name, but the star of the movie is Kevin Farley (on the left, further back).  This would be the equivalent of putting Peter Falk's picture in the center of a promo for ""The Princess Bride"".

Fifth, the plot was disjointed.  It went back and forth from dream sections and the real world.  The Dicken's classic succeeded, but this story did not flow.  Also, I did not really feel Michael Malone's redemption was convincing.  Bill O'Reilly's role as himself made it worse (and yes, I like Bill).

This is a great concept, but it could (and should) have been done better.
I did learn a couple of new things ('40's anti-war rallies and the defense part of Kennedy's speech), but most of the messages were things I've heard in conservative circles for years long enough that liberals would write this off.

Predictably, the liberals had a fit over the movie and their attack was ingenious: their reviews of the movie claimed that it was not funny at all (I guess it wasn't for them).

David Zucker leaves no stone un-turned, taking shots at people and groups such as Michael Moore, the ACLU, the Hollywood elite, and anti-war protestors. This film is not only hilarious, but it reminds all Americans that war, though cruel and unforgiving, is the only way to protect our freedom and the freedom of others; and while our government and institutions aren't perfect, our way of life is the best in the world, and one that thousands flock to come to.

This is a very pro-America movie which suites me very well. The one item I have against the movie is the ""S"" word is used several times, without it adding anything to the movie ( I thought it detracted from it and is why I rated only 4 stars ).

Indeed, if one looks closely at any positive reviews of this movie from regular movie reviewers (with the exception of movie reviewer and rightwing host Medved) you will be disappointed. Simply, this movie is a long rant on liberals ""hating America."" Obviously the Michael Malone character (who wants to end the Fourth of July celebration) is Michael Moore. While rightwingers obviously don't share the politics of Mr. Moore it is absurd to suggest that Mr. Moore (though this Malone character) hates America and wants to end our celebration of the Fourth. Michael Moore's criticism's of our policy. Last I read the policy of a nation are not the same as the country as a whole. Opposing Bush or Obama doesn't make one anti-American or a hater of America. The only people who would really love this movie are those who think that critics of conservativism should be deported to Cuba.

This movie cost $20 million  (really) and only made $7.013 million at the time of this writing and that is with much free advertising on rightwing radio by hosts who either thought it was the funniest/wittiest movie of all time (so much for their judgement) or who were either lieing through their teeth. When one watches this movie, you wonder where exactly did this $20 million budget go. Maybe it should have went for acting lessons for the actors. Maybe for special effects that a 13 year old couldn't create on his own. Maybe Kelsey Grammer commands big money these days. The movie takes cheap shots at the ACLU, the favorite bogeyman of the far right.

3566447,3,B001FACH8M,"Folks, I am a political centrist and I find the far left (the target of this film) just as ridiculous as the far right. So now that you know my politics, here goes the review. While the loony left are apt targets for political satire, AAC tackles this with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The other posters have pretty much told the story, so I'll deal with other aspects.

A couple of things are impressive here. David Zucker gives the film some intelligence with gags about Leni Reifenstahl, the 1930s isolationist movement, and Neville Chamberlain's appeasement with Hitler (of course, Tojo and Mussolini were not involved with this as shown in AAC, but it is a comedy) and the more conservative views of JFK. On this level, he's done his homework.

As a college professor myself, I enjoyed the lampoon of Columbia University far-leftist wackos. I've seen such things that the movie spoofs on different campuses, such as the mindless radical-chic slogan-chanting demonstrators who really don't know what they're doing, and the oldschool hippie professors whose thinking hasn't changed since 1968. This aspect of the movie really rings true to me.

Now as for Michael Moore (OOPS! I mean Michael Malone), of course this is parody and lampoon and I agree that sometimes the real Mike Moore can be obnoxious (as in the horrifc ending of ""Bowling for Columbine""). However, the man is really nowhere near the loathsome anti-American caricature of this picture. While he has no love for the more reactionary conservative view, as Martin Luther King (whom Zucker has sense enough to avoid in this film) said on the Mike Douglas Show on Nov. 2, 1967, ""Dissent should never be confused with disloyalty.""

The film goes too far in it's mockery of handicapped children and the joyous shooting of members of a certain constiutional rights group hated by the far right. Also, I would advise moderate Arab and Muslim-Americans to stay away from this film. The latter will hate the use of the name of Allah for comic purposes. This film does for those groups what ""Birth of a Nation"" did for Blacks (speaking of which, they must have paid David Alan Greir and Gary Coleman some pretty pennies to participate in AAC's slavery parody scene-note the Obama/Madela gags in the deleted scenes that Coleman was said to have ad-libbed).

Overall, the message of this film seems to be, ""War has never solved anything except for creating the United States and for ending slavery Genocide Fascism Nazism and a few other 'unpleasant' institutions and regimes."" While Zucker concentrates on the current war with Afghanistan, which all but the extreme left that this film mocks agree is necessary, he avoids discussion on more ambiguous wars such as Vietnam and the Iraq mess. Also, this movie's subject matter is not for kids at all, so why the framing device of Leslie Nielson as a semi-senile grandfather telling this tale to kids at a 4th of July party? Also, why are the kids cursing so much?

Basically, AAC will appeal only to the Rush Limbaugh/Sarah Palin crowd. Political centrists such as myself will view it as interesting at best and stupid at worst, and the left will dismiss it as mean-spirited.

AN AMERICAN CAROL has an all-star cast, and is written by the David Zucker who also gave us the AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN movies.  It is a very interesting, long over due commentary on our times, and well worth a look.",1235260800,5,752,4.123287671232877

3566457,1,B001FACH8M,"This is a movie I expected to like, if for no real reason than that I really dislike Michael Moore, and he seems like such an easy target for satire.

However, this movie is strictly amateur hour.  The jokes aren't funny, and are often so cliche - listening to the DVD commentary, the director was proudest of a joke where the chanting crowds just mindlessly repeat was the Michael Moore character says.  It's a scene I've seen many, many times before, most notably in ""Life of Brian,"" and just wasn't funny.

There were a very few jokes that were funny and even politically savvy - I liked the take on Fundamentalist Christianity being just as bad as Fundamentalist Islam, where people complain how they can't get on board an airplane because of Fundamentalist Christian attacks.  Then it goes on to people getting naked for airplane security checks, and having to scan underwear, and it's yet another joke that wasn't funny the first time I saw it, much less the thousandth...

These examples may make it sound like there were a bunch of jokes, many of which failed but some of which stuck.  But really, I found the movie more inane than anything.  This movie is on the same level as all the other straight-to-DVD releases Zucker has been shoveling out, or which prominently feature Lesley Nielsen on the cover.

The only people who are going to say they like this movie are solid Republicans desperately looking for a Republican-leaning movie.  And I can't believe they're really, actually like it - just they're happy to support any movie which features a scene where ACLU lawyers are getting shot at.",1234656000,5,1605,4.741007194244604

3566459,5,B001FACH8M,"AN AMERICAN CAROL

Regardless of what your feelings are on democrats/republicans or what ever you are all can enjoy this movie, it is really funny. I remember seeing the trailer for this film a while back and thinking, man they finally are making fun of that guy. Made by the people who brought you such classics as ""Airplane and The Naked Gun"" comes this wonderful work of art, any thing that makes fun of Moore is worth buying. I don't look at this film as a left or right wing production I look at it like a cool play on the Christmas Carol thing, and of course as a great film making fun of Michael. Conservative and liberals alike can laugh at this movie especially since the cast and crew is made up of a mix of both.

Our journey starts off with a group of terrorists that are having trouble accomplishing their mission and goals in life, what is a terrorist to do? So they decide that they need the help of Hollywood to get their message across, they need a great director. Enter one Michael Malone [Farley] who is trying to be taken seriously as a filmmaker so he decides to make a feature film, not a documentary. It seems the timing can not be better for the two to come together and make what he thinks is going to be the greatest movie ever made, so the terrorists hire him. So while employed by this group three ghosts come to visit him and try to put him on the straight and narrow. Of course this movie would not be funny if they convince him right off the bat so he argues with them the entire time, comedic genius follows. They are all off as the terrorist are planning to blow up a building full of people and it is up to our unlikely hero to stop them, will he change in time to save them all and stop the terrorists, or will he fail?

This movie is very funny regardless of your political ideas; I could care less about democrats/republicans and what they think about movies that make fun of either one of them. I have seen movies that go at both and all I have to say is funny is funny, nuff said. Writer/Director David Zucker and co writers Myrna Sokoloff and Lewis Friedman have written a funny little piece making fun of politics, it is that classic slap stick style that made Zucker's earlier classics so good. Zucker is in full form and this is a step up from some of his stuff before this, even though none of that was horrible. Still the greatest thing about this movie is Kevin Farley's performance, he does a magnificent job in this film. I wish he would be getting a lot more roles because he is just as good as his brother Chris, I still remember that MTV movie ""2GETHER"" now that was a funny parody film. Any way Kevin does an excellent job as Michael Malone in this and is in all his comedic splendor as he steals the show.

Kelsey Grammer as General Patton is just as good and is hilarious in the role as he and Kevin play well off of each other, same can be said for Dennis Hopper as the judge, in fact his part is hilarious due to the Romero like zombie scene. Chriss Anglin plays JFK brilliantly in this movie who is Malone's hero until they meet that is, Jon Voight as George Washington and James Woods are both great in this. Leslie Nielsen is his usual goofy yet funny self in this and love him or hate him Bill O'Reilly is hilarious in this movie. Robert Davi, Serdar Kalsin, and Geoffrey Arend are all great as the terrorists and the lady that played Rosie nearly steals the show. A country singer named Trace Atkins plays the Angel of Death very well and I was glad to see Kevin Sorbo make a guest appearance.

It is hard to review a parody film especially one that is a parody of actual people, but I have to say that while this is no were near the best movie ever it is a very enjoyable film. The entire cast and crew of this movie did outstanding jobs and I recommend this movie to all people who do not take themselves seriously all the time. This is not just a movie for republicans/conservatives like it has been said, it is for any one who enjoys comedies.",1234310400,4,4008,4.254593175853018

Indeed, the movie has some great gags and is absolutely ruthless in making fun out of everything you can think of... This is ""no mercy"" humor at its best. However, a few of the gags don't work, and the film overall doesn't have the same rhythm found in ""Airplane"" and ""Airplane 2"". My disappointment came at the last third of the film, when the producers start leaving comedy aside and begin delivering a clear ""support our troops, no matter what"" message, which I find questionable, to say the least. The movie turns into propaganda, and loses the comedy angle it started out with. So I give it 5 stars for the first half, 1 star for the last third.",1234051200,,743,4.470588235294118

Whether or not it's worth your time depends on whether or not you are even capable of ""getting it"" (and if all you listen to is NPR it might not be you) but if you listen to the most popular and successful talk radio shows (meaning the conservative ones) you'll at least get the humor.

That said, much of it is staged and forced in a way that makes Mel Brooks movies look subtle by comparison.  There were, to me at least, some priceless moments.  The college faculty show tune about 1968 was almost worth sitting through the whole thing to see.

I suppose it also depends on what you give up to see the movie.  Are you giving up the full retail price plus storage space on your DVD rack, or can you find a less expensive way to see it before you buy it?

Anyway, it's at least refreshing to see a movie that doesn't repeat the same messages that have been coming out of Hollywood for years and years (since 1968?), and years from now it may be a funny historical commentary on the times in which we live, unless of course the Liberals gain full control and destroy every copy.

Where this movie failed so badly for me was how a serious political topic (war is the ONLY solution for peace) was justified (over and over and over again) based on such an absurd characterization of the other side.

3566472,1,B001FACH8M,"""An American Carol"" is a political satire, targeting what the writers consider to be the extreme left, such as Michael Moore, represented by the character Michael Malone. Malone is an award winning, self absorbed documentary filmmaker who treats everyone around him badly. He gets visited by historical figures such as John F Kennedy, General Patton and George Washington, who explains to him things such as how important it is for the US to be involved in the ""war on terror"". Bill O'Reilly appears as himself and is given the role as a voice of reason against the ""nutty leftists"" such as Malone and one ""Rosie O'Connell"". If you'll agree with the movie's political statements or not depends pretty much on whether you think Bill O'Reilly is a wise and reasonable man or not.

However, politics aside, the movie is after all a comedy, a satire. Good satire exaggerates reality to point out absurdities. Clever satire is subtle and makes the audience think. ""An American Carol"" is about as subtle as director David Zucker's other comedies, such as Airplane and Scary Movie 3 and 4. That type of comedy may work in film spoofs like those, but not in political satire. The satire doesn't work because the characters are too extreme to the point of being straw men of what they're trying to satirize. Also, Zucker and his co-writers doesn't seem to trust their own material, because they persist in over-explaining their jokes. Instead of making them funnier, it kills them. For example, there's a scene where the documentary film industry is having an awards ceremony. The award is called the ""Leni Riefenstahl Award"", a somewhat clever hint that documentary films are often used for propaganda. But just in case someone didn't get the hint, they have Paris Hilton explain who Leni Riefenstahl was and go on to say that documentary movies really always are propaganda. In having to explain the jokes, not only do the writers seem not to trust their own jokes - they don't seem to trust the audience. The result is jokes that fall flat in a patronising movie that insults the viewer's intellect, no matter what thir political views may be.

So to sum up, while I admit I disagree with the movie's political points (such as that everyone who disagrees with the war on terror is anti-american and that it's abuse of freedom of speech to speak out against it), I also think, politics aside, the movie just isn't funny and what's worse, it's patronising to the audience.

David Zucker has written, directed and produce a movie that is a hysterically unfunny and offensive. A triple crown in move making failure.

  When the local video store was giving away this box office bomb with purchase of a candy bar,  I had very low expectations for this DVD.  And David Zucker delivered.  American Carol is the Citizen Kane of bad movies.

  The only entertaining feature of the film was trying to name all the washed up actors in the film.  All giving the worst performance of their careers including Kelsey Grammer. Even Ann Coulter with her adams apple could have portrayed George Patton with little bit more machismo. And poor Kevin Farley.  This film will boast his career like Showgirls did for Elizabeth Berkley career.  Not to be all negative.  The ACLU lawyers were the best zombies since the studio audience of the ill fated Rush Limbaugh television show.

  I could deal the dozens of fat jokes and racist stereotypes. But to suggest that JFK would give his stamp of approval for the last eight years of shame by the Bush administration is going way off of the deep end of reality.

  David Zucker is a Leni Riefenstahl wanna be by suggesting Michael Moore only doing movies about the ""good things"" about American. In fact the concert headed by some talentless hack of a singer at the end of the film reminds me of scene right of the Triumph of the Will.

The good and the bad: There were some very good, laugh-out-loud poking-fun-at jokes and sight gags in here that made the film worth seeing. Kelsey Grammar was outstanding as ""General Patton.""  I can't say the rest of the cast impressed me that much, including Kevin Farley who played ""Michael Malone,"" a caricature of Michael Moore. In Farley's defense, they wanted his character to be as silly and goofy as you can get and he certainly delivered that! Grammar, however, gets an ""A"" for his more subtly humorous effort.

Much of the humor is slapstick where someone gets hit or slapped in the face (or worse).  That's okay, but after the tenth slap it gets tiring.  I also found it, as I always do, offensive to hear little kids use profanity, although I know it was used for shock affect. Still, there are better ways to go for laughs than have eight-year-olds use profanity.

Overall, it was refreshing to hear and see the Left Loonies bashed for a change. Since there were good, patriotic messages, I just wish the film had less ""potty"" humor and better acting.

I immediately e-mailed several friends and family members and encouraged them to seek out the movie and see it too.

""An American Carol"" is a brilliant slapstick satire that functions much as Ann Coulter's books do.  It pokes fun at liberal sacred cows in the most outrageous manner possible, and it gives the conservative consumer the double pleasure of enjoying the humor while imagining just how huge a knot in the panties will afflict the wardrobe of any liberal who happens to see it.

Reading the quietly seething reviews of leftist movie critics just added to my pleasure.  They wax ecstatic over such politically correct yawners as ""W"" and ""Milk"" and ""Frost-Nixon,"" while they sneer at most movies that normal Americans might enjoy.  May the newspapers for which they write continue to go bankrupt and may they be forced to find real, productive jobs in order to finance their frequent bathhouse visits.

Conservatives should have supported this movie in greater numbers, especially because of the tremendous risk its creators took in making it.

Micheal Moore, magnificently sent up by Kevin Farley, comes across as the befuddled, dishonest charlatan his, praising the Cuban health care system an despoling the nation that allows him to ply his craft of professional liar.

  The ghosts of July 4th, past, present and future visit Michael Malone, the Farley character, when he launches his campaign to abolish the 4th of July.

  Beginning with John F. Kennedy who reminds Malone/Moore that he, an icon of the left-wing, made Ronald Reagan sound like a pacifist in some ways. Then on to Gen. George S. Patton, the WWII hero, lovingly played by Kelsey Grammer who tries to teach Malone about America's fighting for freedom and that war is not necessarily always unjustified. A hilariously politically incorrect scene makes Malone/Moore the largest slave owner in present-day Alabama because Lincoln followed the left-wing and refused to fight the Civil War. It is unlikely that anyone on the left will grasp the irony of that scene or another in which demonstrations against Franklin Roosevelt by the left-wing, proclaiming him a war monger are recreated.

  The storyline, an obvious lift of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", is obvious. Malone, through the intercession of the ghosts of Kennedy, Patton, Washington and the Angel of Death is brought to see the truth: that evil exists and the threat of terrorism is real. The film, especially with the latter point, is pure fantasy.

  The movie is very funny owing to the crude humor employed by Zucker of Naked Gun and Airplane fame. The folks making this movie all appear to have had a lot of fun doing their jobs. While it won't convince anyone on the left to change their views, it will definitely make them angry and lead them to show their true colors by lying about the film.

3566488,5,B001FACH8M,"Be warned there may be unintentional spoilers.

One thing I must mention before getting to the review is the amount of negative criticism aimed at this movie.  It is probably the only movie supporting pro-American sentiments among the plethora of anti-American ones.  And like pigs to the slaughter, liberals beat this thing down like like a whack-a-mole game.  But when conservatives assert their views over liberally biased movies and news/television shows, we are considered ignorant, stupid, unintelligent, (apologies for redundancy).  Thank you Zucker for this film, and it's too bad you decided against a sequel.  It doesn't help that this movie was shown in an extremely small amount of theaters, thus assisting in its money shortage.  Yet movies with liberal bias can't find enough theaters to infest.  Now on with the review.

In short, I liked this movie.  It was short, entertaining, and quick with the humor, both verbal and slapstick.  Farley acts in comparison with his late brother, the only thing that may have made this better, would have been seeing David Spade by his side.  I always hoped Kevin would gain a staring role.  Maybe this will help him, maybe it will hurt him.  This movie doesn't preach war mongering, but the idea of fighting is suggested as needed at the right times.  This movie is a conservatively biased movie, yet they use John F. Kennedy, a Democratic President, as a Jacob Marleyesque character.  Conservatives are not out to destroy the world, they simply accept that like a school yard bully, words are not always the answer, but they can be a good place to start.

Like ""A Christmas Carol"" Farly's character deals with three ghosts, Kelsey Grammers ghost being the one most seen.  In the end, like in Dickins original, Farley sees the ""error"" (obviously depends on your political views)of his ways and changes, thus avoiding death and saving the lives of 20,000 people at Madison Square Garden after inadvertently assisting a terrorist earlier on and throughout the course of the film.

The overall plot is silly, and if you read too hard into it, you may have trouble enjoying it.  But in my opinion this is a must see for conservatives, especially if you have had enough of the America bashing Hollywood scene.

P.S. College professors beware, there are insults aimed at you during the course of this movie.",1230940800,29,2353,4.9363867684478375

I live near the Peoples Republic of Seattle, so it came as no surprise that the reviewers at the local commie daily rags ignored the movie and it disappeared from local theaters quickly.

Acts I & II go smoothly enough, with the exception of Bill O'Reilly's first appearance playing himself (which he does poorly, in a poorly-written, painfully unfunny bit which also features a Rosie O'Donnell lookalike).

It's startling to see the Left's dogma and heroes being ridiculed.  Zucker scores enough bullseyes to make the DVD a must-own for anyone with enough grasp on reality to see how the Old Media generally bends it.

But he sells out in Act III and that, for me, takes the film from 4.5 stars down to 3 stars, tops.

Still, the scene where the demonstrators are mindlessly chanting everything the Michael Moore character says to them is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie; funniest because the best humor has an element of truth to it.

So I recommend it, but wish it could have been better.",1230854400,8,1072,4.64021164021164
3566490,3,B001FACH8M,"I'm no fan of blow-hard director Michael Moore, so seeing that this film was basically a skewering of Moore, it was easily worth renting and checking out to see how good the skewering actually was.

Just about anyone could probably put together a pretty good parody of Moore, he's a fairly easy (and fairly large!!!) target, making himself all the easier to hit, but in the case of An American Carol, the people doing the skewers are the Zuckers, or at least part of that team that brought us Airplane and other comedic gold.  Unfortunately in the case of An American Carol, I'm not so sure that it's gold that we're getting rather than some other almost shiny material to look at.

The Christmas Carol story has been done by just about everyone it seems, including sitcoms, other films, made for TV movies, and the like.  Apparently it's cheap to start with an existing story and then just rework it slightly to have it fit the cast you have in mind for the roles.  How effective, and enjoyable, the end product is depends on whether you can get the audience emotionally invested in the character that is filling the Scrooge role -- in this case a knockoff of Michael Moore.  You also, of course, have to find the eventual transformation somewhat believable.  This is where An American Carol eventually falls apart.

It's easy to put together a film with someone that looks a little like Moore, have them behave a bit like Moore, and then show them eventually almost getting it and behaving in a somewhat patriotic manner (even as they demonstrate a complete lack of competence) but in the end anyone that knows anything about the political situation in the United States, and especially in most of Hollywood knows that the chances of Michael Moore actually having even a hint of guilt over his generally un-American and un-Patriotic behavior are between slim and none and Slim just left town.

There are a few laughs sprinkled in the film, but sadly I think the people that should be learning the lessons are never going to watch An American Carol, even if told that their own lives depended upon doing so.  Much like a lot of the people lampooned in the film, the ones that don't get it, well, they aren't going to get it no matter how much others laugh at them.

So what's left, then, to find value of in this film?  There's a parade of right leaning actors and some country music to enjoy if one is so inclined.  Outside of that, well there's a few bad words tossed around just for fun, and picture quality that is ok but doesn't really rise to the level of awe inspiring (mostly because the places where the film takes place don't seem that impressive).

I give the effort 3 stars.  It's not garbage, and yes there are some laughs mixed in, but it's not all that great either, and unfortunately it really seems to have a target audience that already despises the character it makes the most fun of, so it's not likely to round up viewers just for that reason.

3566492,2,B001FACH8M,"When reading reviews of American Carol, be careful to not read any reviews that are from obvious liberals. It may be difficult to pick out the reviews from liberals, but those will generally be the ones filled with the most hate. American Carol is a political movie, and is obviously going to generate strong opinions. This really is a preach to the choir type movie. David Zucker is the king of parody. He started it all with Airplane and is still involved in the diluted genre with movies like Scary Movie 4. So, does Zucker still have it. Well, its hard to tell from this movie. American Carol is so blatantly right wing, pro military that it is hard to pick through the message to find the movie.

Michael Malone (Kevin Farley as a obvious Michael Moore) hates America and its stance on war. Malone is visited by George Patton, John F. Kennedy and an angel of death. These ghosts try and show him what would happen if the USA never fought wars, if the ACLU always got its way, and if Malone's pacifist views prevailed. Also, Malone gets caught up unwittingly in a terrorist plot to blow up Madison Square Garden during a pro America concert given by Trace Adkins.

Is this a good movie? Leaving the theater, I was struck more by its politcal stance than its movie quality. So, no. Then again, maybe it is. This movie was made to be a pro-American politcal satire and, in the history of Hollywood, it is alone in that category. There is nothing to compare it to. Fans of Zucker movies should watch as should all conservatives who might like Zucker movies. By focusing on the Michael Moore ripoff so much, this movie doesn't play as broadly as it could. This movie has very specific targets (the anti-military, head in the sand left) and doesn't focus on liberals in general. I didn't find much of the witty dialogue present in past Zucker movies. American Carol uses slapstick heavily and ignores subtlety altogether.

I might need to watch this movie again to try and separate the political aspects of the movie with the actual movie itself. Then again that is hard to do. So, conservatives, watch and enjoy then move on. I seriously applaud the effort by Zucker and his conservative Hollywood cohorts.

Fairly big star power are under this tent, but the delivery works better than some of the material. Michael Marone (Kevin Farley, brother of the late Chris Farley), a thinly disguised Moore, wants to abolish celebrating The Fourth of July.  Taking the model of Dickens' `A Christmas Carol,' three historical ghosts: President Kennedy (Chriss Anglin), Gen. Patton (Kelsey Grammer), and George Washington (Jon Voigt) try to bring Marone to the patriotic straight and narrow while jihadists work another 9/11 type attack under his nose.  Exaggeration and distortion are at about an even keel here, but while exaggeration is essential to satire and humor, distortion is not. There are some blurt out funny moments beside some obvious developments.  Despite the flaws, `American Carol' will undoubtedly appeal to some conservatives who won't quibble with the sometimes warped aspects of Moore`s portrayal.

3566498,5,B001FACH8M,"Bought this dvd in our base PX on Xmas.  I had watched this while doing night shift in the commo cell, and I couldn't stop cracking up.  The homage to George Romero with Dennis Hopper (who played in Romero's ""Land of the Dead"") and General Patton fighting ACLU zombies was priceless. The performances of Robert Davi, Serdar Kalsin, and Geoffrey Arend as the terrorists, Aziz, Ahmed, and Mohammed were wonderfully rememnisant of the old World War II-era Three Stooges classics like ""They Stooge To Conga"" where the Stooges lampooned the Nazis just as Davi, Kalsin, and Arend lampoons the IslamoNazis.  The University scene was all too true, especially with my experience in college dealing with faculty who were still stuck in the '60's.  And finally, Trace Atkins' ""Angel of Death"" and the scene of Hollywood after the IslamoNazis take over was great.  Aside from the comedy value, the scenes of alternate history that would have resulted if the advice of Micheal Moore and the liberals was followed, such as in the Civil war or World War II, can make one think.

Notable mentions is Kevin Farley's protrayal as Micheal Moore (Malone) as buffonish, arrogant, hardheaded, selfish, and inconsiderate were right on the mark given reports of Moore's arrogance in real life.  Kelsey Grammer was great as General Patton and Jon Voight's protrayal of George Washington was really touching.  Dennis Hopper was one good choice that made the George Romero homage scene work (Ken Forre would have been good too and Duane Jones would have been perfect but he's sadly deceased) and it was a good surprise to see regular tough-guy actor Robert Davi can do comedy as a  modern day Moe.

This film is as good as the intellectually important as Ben Steins' docudrama, ""Expelled, No Intelligence Allowed"".

We were invited to a pre-screening of Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise, however mostly true but with some mistruths, but the film was so boring.

In our family we do not pay to see movies in theaters which are anit-American, and we boycott actors, directors in films which make public political statements, they are paid to entertain us, and nothing else.

If Hollywood would like to make money, make films which are equal for everyone to enjoy, else their box office receipts will continue to decline in revenues.

I was absolutely dying to see ""An American Carol,"" and for the politically incorrect conservative that I am, this movie was hysterical! But then, I loved Airplane and the Naked Gun movies, so this kind of ribald, broad satire (with corny jokes that can't help but make you laugh out loud) is right up my alley.

I wasn't the only one. The theatre I saw ""Carol"" in was about three-quarters full, and for most of the movie, the roar of laughter was constant from the first frame. Clearly there were no leftwing movie reviewers in that particular ""Carol"" showing!

Contrary to what the ""official"" Amazon reviewer, Sam Graham (who the hell is Sam Graham??) intoned, ""Carol"" is indeed a total hoot! It soothed every frayed nerve I had since 9/11, at least insofar as the loony left and their crazy, incessant tirades were concerned. Finally, some expert moviemakers were willing to take on the left's sacred cows, and mock on them in a savagely witty way with no holds barred.

Does ""Carol"" hit every mark? Oh, of course not, but then with any of Zucker's movies, the gags come so fast and furious that if one misses the mark, the next 10 more than make up for it. You can't sit in a movie this funny and not laugh your butt off!

My only fear with ""Carol"" is that Zucker won't delight us with any more movies in a similar leftie ox-goring vein. God knows there's a huge audience out there for funny movies, and skewering the left while you're at it just makes it all the more delicious.

I normally don't buy dvds unless I love the movie enough to see it again and again (and that includes the few serious notes in ""Carol"".) Only a select few movies make it into my dvd library, and ""An American Carol"" is going to be one of them.

That is inexcusable - considering the WIDE release of ""W"" and ""Religulous"" right around the same time! Would it have been that difficult to actually give a right-leaning comedy a fair shake?

I, also, hold out hope that DVD purchases and rentals of this movie will show that there IS a great appreciation for films such as this when they are made accessible. This was a delightful ""change of pace"" for the movie industry. Liberal film makers a-plenty find it perfectly acceptable to insult, embarress, de-fame, ridicule, etc. conservative persons and ideals without fear of retribution, in fact - they THRIVE on it! So WHY NOT have a little ""dose"" from the other point of view? Suddenly, they are no longer so ""open minded"".......

This movie was not only funny, but taught some great lessons about our American History - our failures and our successes. Kelsey Grammer was superb as always. Leslie Nielson, although a little ""tired"" in his performance (he is getting on in years after all), was quite good. Kevin Farley was a perfect pick for ""Michael Malone"", and I do hope he will see the same kind of future success that Jim Belushi saw after the passing of his brother, John - the family talent is definitely there! All the other cameo appearances of famous faces were greatly enjoyed by this reviewer as well.

My favorite scene - though there were many great ones - was the cocktail party/reception where the 3 terrorists encounter each other in the crowded room. I will not say more, as I do not want to spoil the moment for anyone who is waiting to view the movie for the first time upon its December 30th release, but this scene granted me a very theraputic laugh (even talking about it after the fact!)

In case you don't know, this film, from AIRPLANE creator David Zucker, is a conservative-made spoof of, for lack of a better word, the liberal mindset or point-of-view.  It is very much in the style of AIRPLANE type movies, but from a humor standpoint, it falls a little more into the SCARY MOVIE level of success.  There are plenty of laughs and plenty of clunkers.  If you don't like these kinds of movies, with rapid-fire jokes, low comedy and nonsensical plots...just steer clear.

It tells the story of a Michael Moore-like filmmaker (played by Chris Farley's younger brother Kevin), who has grown to hate America so much that he's actually campaigning to abolish the 4th of July!  He is then visited by three ""ghosts"" (mostly General Patton, but also briefly by George Washington and the Angel of Death), who show him past events in American history and his own life that cause him to rethink his attitudes towards the US.  (In case you hadn't guessed from this description or the title...the premise is a loosey-goosey gloss on A CHRISTMAS CAROL.)

The film DOES have some very funny moments.  There is a hilarious bit with Rosie O'Connell (NOT Rosie O'Donnell), a shrill America-hater who happens to look like Rosie O'Donnell (see, the ""humor"" isn't always very subtle)...who screens for Bill O'Reilly (the REAL Bill O'Reilly, playing himself, just like he does in real life) a ""documentary"" she has made showing that we shouldn't be profiling Arab-appearing persons in security lines at airports because there is a ""vast Christian-fundamentalist terrorist conspiracy"" out there.  It's a heavy-handed bit...but it also does a nice job of reminding us just what types of people HAVE actually attacked our country, and that frisking old, white American grannies just to appear NOT to be profiling might be a waste of time.  But politics aside, the bit is just plain funny.

There are running gags about Michael Moore...whoops, I mean Michael Malone...receiving no real respect as a documentarian.  (""I have an Oscar!""  ""Yeah, for documentaries."")  These are pretty funny, and provide the main plot impetus...terrorists are trying to recruit Malone to make a ""real"" movie, rather than a documentary, about how great the Taliban and its ilk are.  Malone is actually mightily tempted.

Kelsey Grammer plays Patton, and he's pretty much exactly what you'd expect.  Farley doesn't exactly rise to Oscar level with his performance, but if anyone will get a ""bounce"" from this film, it may be him.  He's a nice presence on the screen, and I think might do well with a subtler role.  Other appearances come from folks like Robert Davi and Dennis Hopper (it's fun to see which familiar actors have aligned themselves with the conservative side).  And naturally, Leslie Nielsen is in the film.  By law, he must be in all films of this sort.  Although he's less funny than he's ever been.

Jon Voight, in a brief but actually poignant scene, plays Washington.  I won't tell you more...but the moment he shares with Malone on September 11, 2001 is pretty moving, because you don't see it coming.  Yes, it's manipulative...but it also informs the viewer exactly why the creators of this film felt it was so important to make it.

Are the jabs at liberals mostly obvious cheap-shots?  Yes.  But conservatives would argue (rightfully) that films like RENDITION & LIONS FOR LAMBS & REDACTED have been little more than liberal diatribes against Republicans.  So it no doubt felt good to get a little anger out of the system...and the film is fitfully amusing.  HOWEVER, if you find you have no sense of humor whatsoever about strongly held ""Democrat"" beliefs...then why get your blood boiling with a mediocre movie.  Republicans looking to get a little frustration out of their system will find the film to provide satisfactory catharsis.  The audience I saw it with was very appreciative of the film, despite its heavy-handedness.  I heard more than one person, on the way out of the theatre, proclaim, ""It's about time.""

A short sampling of reviews from professionals (all leftists):

There's a good idea for a movie here: Someone considered poking fun at liberal filmmaker Michael Moore. The only problem with 'An American Carol' is that it's not funny.

Forget politics: An American Carol sucks simply because it's ridiculously, painfully unfunny.

How dumb does Hollywood think American conservatives are? Not half as dumb as conservative filmmaker David Zucker thinks they are.

... the jokes are lame and the caricatures too removed from any defensible reality.

This is an uneven, uninspired, tired spoof that has about 10 funny jokes throughout.

An American Carol dares to mock the Left, but it forgets to bring the funny.

As entertainment, An American Carol ranks below YouTube clips of Sarah Palin.

Zucker's film reeks of a deeply insecure psychosis, one that's often insultingly mislabeled as patriotism -- which is how it gets away with wrapping itself in red, white and blue while simultaneously ridiculing our Bill Of Rights.

Overall, Zucker's cinematic middle finger is about as funny as an exploding toilet seat for hemorrhoid-induced senior citizens...a dreary picture mired in sophomoric sludge.

Poorly made indie production has a script that feels like a list of ripostes collected over the last several years to liberal criticisms of the U.S.: The whole enterprise feels far more agenda- than entertainment-driven.

Utterly asinine, sophomoric, tasteless, the movie has much in common with Zucker's Airplane!, The Naked Gun 2 1/2 and Scary Movie sequels, minus the laughs.

An American Carol is about as not-funny as a comedy can get.

It makes even the those that support what they are tearing down and visa versa laugh and in some cases agree. Everyone did a great job on this, and the choice to have Trace Adkins in it was a good one....it's been said it wouldn't have done as well as it did at the box office without him.
I am not Republican or Democrat perse' but I see both sides represented in this movie.
Way to go guys! I can't wait to run in and grab this 30 December!",1228089600,41,583,3.9914529914529915
3566513,5,B001FACH8M,"I saw the premire of this movie while attending the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis.  If you are a right leaning person, you will love this movie.  While it didn't do very well at the box office, I believe that the DVD sales for it will be very good.  Every conservative should own a copy for two reasons: 1)We need to support movies like this so Hollywood won't be scared to make conservative movies, and 2)The movie slays so many liberal sacred cows.  This is a very politically incorrect movie.  I had a great time watching it and I look forward to the DVD release.

UPDATE:  I purchased the DVD from a Best Buy on the release date and it was almost sold out by 2 P.M.  Great!",1228003200,98,693,4.359375

8301415,5,B001FACH8M,"I loved it. Funny, silly, and makes some good points.  It got a little over the top with the gags toward the end but what do you expect from David Zucker.  If you're one of those Michael Moore loving, tolerant leftists who believes that all the world's problems are because of the United States of America, its Judeo-Christian values and its Constitution then you probably won't like it. If not then its worth a look see and it will bring a smile to your face.",1525219200,,460,4.4

8301419,2,B001FACH8M,"There was far too much talent and the potential to share really poignant bits for this to fall as flat as it did. Frankly it was horribly executed. It was like watching my team throw interception after interception. At some point, you pull the qb off the field. No one did that here.

The story development was closer to a 4th grade level writing assignment. Actually, I would offer up that the play I wrote in the 4th grade was a better production. This movie was that bad.

Supremely disappointed. And I paid to watch it.

The spoofs were of naked gun bits that didn't even remotely fit the story line. The redemption of the anti-hero was lame and disjointed. The ties to scrooge, ugh, fine, but they don't need to be that literal. Good heavens.

There was so much potential for really biting commentary about ""malone"" but instead they focused on his fatness. Yeah, he's fat. Okay. So what. He also spends his time creating position pieces intending to divide us. Isn't THAT the more important position to attack?!?!?!

It was disappointing because any sane adult - even one very sympathetic - is going to see this and think that the team making it was really just a bunch of low level bullies. BECAUSE THEY NEVER REALLY MADE A d*mn point. It was like your idiot drunk uncle ranting. You may agree with the gist of his rant, but he still comes across as an idiot drunk. Not compelling and not something you can share with someone on the cusp. So, just a giant waste of space.

Do you have any idea how hard it is to find things I can share with my students on the cusp so they'll think critically about the positions they hold? This failed us.

BOOOOOO. This movie stunk. Absolute failure to bring either humor or critical evaluation to a giant ass. Perhaps my hopes were too high, but this was an absolute let down.",1518825600,,1818,4.474320241691843

8301421,3,B001FACH8M,"Normally, I like Zucker films but I found this parody to be lacking in storyline and effect. Michael Malone was played by Kevin Farley as a Michael Moore wannabe. He is left left wing film-maker. Before the Fourth of July holiday, he is visited by a country singer, Trace Adkins and General Patton played by Kelsey Grammar. Even though I am a fan of Michael Moore movies, this film isn't that funny in working or understanding Michael Moore. Of course, Malone is a caricature of Michael Moore and a poor one at that.

Look I love Zucker comedy films and even Michael Moore movies too, I would have loved to see Michael Malone be more than a one dimensional character in this movie. There is no shortage of tasteless and even insensitive jokes about terrorism and war. The DVD features trailers and deleted scenes. I would had enjoyed a special feature about the making of the movie. Maybe I'll watch it again too.",1517702400,,913,4.601226993865031
