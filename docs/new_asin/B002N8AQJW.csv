8374834,4,B002N8AQJW,"Typical early 60's West German-made English dubbed Edgar Wallace thriller mystery.  Involves some individuals trying to get an inheritance they're not entitled to, spooky looking mansions, investigating detectives, and a totally out of his mind scientist.  The Sinister Cinema DVD-R is pretty good quality, though the film is framed with black bands.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1518307200,,386,5.620689655172414
8374835,3,B002N8AQJW,"Based upon the Edgar Wallace novel ""Door With Seven Locks"". This is a 1960s' dubbed remake of the 1940 British film. The original has a much different scenario. It starred Leslie Banks (""The Most Dangerous Game"") and Lili Palmer. I'd watch this 1962 version as a companion to the original 1940 version ""The Door With Seven Looks"" (A.K.A: ""Chamber of Horrors"" in the US).",1517616000,,370,4.796875
8374836,3,B002N8AQJW,"This detective/gothic horror film features a convoluted plot full of improbable coincidences and head-spinning detours.  The great Klaus Kinski makes an appearance in the opening reel, but his role proves to be nothing but a speed-bump on the winding road ahead.  As for the titular seven keys, they play a very small role until the last ten minutes or so, when an explosive flurry of exposition worthy of the psychiatrist's speech at the end of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" finally explains much of what's happened in the last hour and a half.
At about the two-thirds mark we reach my favorite of the many surreal subplots:  a mad-doctor story that appears to owe much to Ed Wood's classic ""The Bride of the Monster.""  I kid you not; it's all there!  A mad doctor a la Bela Lugosi trying to create a race of supermen (he even uses the word), a lab assistant named ""Jacko"" who bears an uncanny resemblance to Tor Johnson's ""Lobo""--the only thing missing is the rubber octopus!
If you are in the mood for a movie that's funny in all sorts of ways--some of them surely unintentional--you might give this one a try.",1482451200,,1111,4.676923076923077
