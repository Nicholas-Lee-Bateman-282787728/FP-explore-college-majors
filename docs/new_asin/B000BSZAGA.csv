2439672,3,B000BSZAGA,"I'm rather surprised at this PPV, because on paper, it looked like ARMAGEDDON 2005 was going to be a disaster from start to finish.  Considering that bookings for these matches were rushed, ARMAGEDDON 2005 managed to avoid ""awful"" and acheieve ""mediocrity"".

JBL cuts an excellent promo in the ring, and has an okay match with Matt Hardy.  A little too one-sided for my taste, plus these guys' styles seemed to mesh well together.  I'm giving it my personal score, but I gotta admit the crowd was really into this opener.  (5.0 / 10)

Then MNM take on Super Crazy & Psicosis (of the Mexicools) in an excellent Tag Team Match.  This was going to be a titles match until MNM lost the belts two days prior.  But that took nothing away from the contest; a great faceoff between two great teams.  One of the year's best matches!  (8.5 / 10)

Booker T and Chris Benoit continue their Best-of-Seven Series, with Booker ahead 3-0, in Match #4.  Believe it or not, this wasn't too predictable, as Benoit nearly loses on plenty of occasions.  I've seen these two do better, but Booker T and Benoit know how to make slower wrestling look strategic and intelligent.  (6.5 / 10)

Then comes along a boring promo with Vito and Nunzio (FBI) dressed an evil Santa and elf, only to have The Boogeyman make short work of them.

We then get a pointless little match where Bobby Lashley takes on both Paul Burchill and William Regal in a 1-on-2 Handicap Match.  Lashley getting a nice push, while Regal & Burchill still keep some credibility.  But these 5 minutes are filler, and are forgettable when the finish comes.  (5.5 / 10)

The Friendly Tap bar, home to many WWF/WWE comedy scenarios, is then the setting for the bizarre Tim White suicide.  Don't ask.

Kid Kash challenges Juventud for the Cruiserweight Championship, with the crowd just bored and mostly dead.  That's kind of sad, as Kash and Juvi work very hard and get no crowd momentum.  Good physicality, but the tough crowd took me out of it.  (5.0 / 10)

Kane & Big Show (RAW's World Tag Team champions) take on Batista & Rey Mysterio (SmackDown's WWE Tag Team champions).  Sadly, due to Mysterio's smaller size and Batista's real-life injuries, this match was kept short.  What's here is good, but way too short and inconsequential.  One ponders what the point of this all was, considering the WWE didn't continue this storyline.  (5.5 / 10)

For the main event, Randy Orton and The Undertaker conclude their awesome feud with an average Hell-In-A-Cell Match.  I've noticed many writers and critics love this match, so maybe I admit I'm in the minority on this one.  But I didn't witness Hell-In-A-Cell; I saw was a No DQ Match that happened to have a cage around it --- see the difference?  I think what I dislike the most is that Taker and Orton compete in a very slow match, and I don't mean ""slow"" in a good way.  You'd think that two guys who competed at WRESTLEMANIA and engaged in violent mind games would have more energy in the final showdown.  I don't consider this Cell Match to be bad, but it's not exactly good either.  I want to love this --- the outstanding Taker/Orton feud was 2005's best, but this 30-minute main event just didn't do the trick.  (6.5 / 10)

ARMAGEDDON 2005 turned out much better than I thought it would.  But overall, I can't quite recommend it because I was really disappointed with the two main events.  Also, the extended ""comedy"" moments (the suicide & FBI Christmas) were flatout weird.  To make matters worse, there is only one Extra (a 10-minute look back on previous Friendly Tap Bar segments).  If you can get this at a cheap price ($10 or less), you might like it.",1153180800,7,3656,4.594427244582043

2439675,3,B000BSZAGA,"Usually, SmackDown only PPV's leave a bad taste in my mouth because it always comes off like an old WCW PPV where they work on their top three matches & then just throw a bunch of fillers in there to take up PPV time with a poor to zero buildup & the matches just end up putting me to sleep.  However, this has been one of the better overall SmackDown PPV's ever since the split.  Of course, there are some things to fast foward through but still, it's good.

JBL v. Matt Hardy - A decent opener but honestly, nothing really memorable & not the best performance from Matt Hardy.

MNM v. Mexicools - Two of the best tag teams on the SmackDown brand.  They kinda killed the buildup with the tag titles no longer being on the line but it's still a great tag team match.  One of the best in the past year of WWE.

Chris Benoit v. Booker T - This match doesn't surpass any of their previous ones but it's still a great match.

Now comes the parts to where you start to press the skip button.
Lashley v. Regal and Burchill - Just a squash, nothing memorable.  Just not a fan of squash matches on a PPV.

Vito & Nunzio come dressed as Santa & his elf out for a boring skit until Boogeyman showed up & did his usual worm deal.

Tim White's skit about suicide was just boring, stupid, had no point, and just seemed to drag on forever.

Juventud v. Kid Kash - These two actually had a decent match but nobody gave a damn since the Tim White skit really killed the crowd.

The PPV starts to pick up again here...
Big Show and Kane v. Batista and Mysterio - Watchable but overall, nothing memorable & pretty short since Batista was limited with his injury & Mysterio had to carry the load.

Hell In A Cell: Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match match more than a Hell In The Cell match.  Weapons were used like a chain & steel steps while everyone bled (including Cowboy Bob & the referee).  I personally enjoyed it while some didn't because again...it wasn't as brutal, non-stop high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.

The DVD extra was that they showed all the skits they've filmed over the years (all of them involving the A.P.A.) at ""The Friendly Tap"" bar that they did the Tim White skit at earlier.

I know my review probably isn't the best one but compare this to other SmackDown PPV's like Great American Bash, No Way Out, and Judgment Day...you'll see this is one of the better ones out there.",1146960000,6,2472,4.26824034334764
2439676,3,B000BSZAGA,"JBL(w/Jillian) vs Matt Hardy 6/10- nothing spectacular here. not a good match to open with. too slow paced. Hardy may has seen his better days.

great backstage segment with the Mexicools & Melina. these guys are funny.

MNM vs Mexicools 7/10- a liitle better than the opening match. this was originally for the tag titles until MNM lost on Smackdown 2 days earlier. no titles takes some of the luster out of this match. pretty good but could have been better.

great interview segment with Booker T & Sharmell done by the new  diva, Krystal.

Match 4 In The Best Of 7 Series For The United States Championship
Booker T(w/Sharmell) vs Chris Benoit 8/10- Benoit is down 3-0 & is in a must win situation. the pace starts slow & gets edge of your seat by the end. if not for the slow start, it would have been rated higher.

a pretty good segment in the ring involving Teddy Long, Palmer Canon, Vito as Santa Claus, Nunzio as an elf & Boogeyman.

2 On 1 Handicap Match
William Regal & Paul Burchill vs Lashley 5/10- nothing special here. Lashley is improving. good to see Regal in a ppv. Burchill's ppv debut.

horrible segment with Josh Matthews interviewing former WWE referee Tim White in a bar. this is tasteless trash that shouldn't even be shown. finding humor in suicide? this ruins the whole ppv.

WWE Cruiserweight Championship
Juventud vs Kid Kash 5.5/10- the Tim White segment ruined this match. the crowd was stunned & silent during this match. WWE is ruining the cruiserweight division. what could have been a awesome match was destroyed. this was Juventud's last ppv appearance & Kash's debut.

Raw vs Smackdown
Big Show & Kane vs Batista & Rey Mysterio 9/10- this was billed as a champions vs champions match but no belts were on the line. the 2 Raw monsters invading Smackdown was a good angle. Batista wrestles with an injured back that is taped up. this is the match of the night that steals the show. these 4 put on a great show.

Hell In A Cell
Randy Orton vs Undertaker 6.5/10- this is probably the worst Cell match ever. Orton has never been in one & it shows. the most excitement is the last 5 minutes when Cowboy Bob Orton tries to interfere. it was way too long & boring in spots. surprised to see the referee bleed.

this isn't the best way for WWE to end 2005. this is probably one of the worst pay per views ever. The end may be near for Smackdown if this keeps up. without Raw, WWE would be out of business.",1139011200,2,2433,4.454954954954955

2439678,4,B000BSZAGA,"SMACKDOWN PRESENTS

ARMAGEDON 2005

During the month of December Smackdown came with a pay-per-view that featured a great Hell in the Cell match and yet still didn't match RAW pay-per-views as far as atmosphere goes. And as much as I like the performers from Smackdown I still prefer the action on Raws events. With that aside this is still a nice event with great moments to keep you into the action.

1. MAT HARDY vs. J.B.L.-the event kicks off with an ok match that saw JBL defeat Mat Hardy despite how much Hardy should have won. This match had come together just two days earlier when JBL interrupted an interview Mat was in. The match starts off nice with Hardy surprising JBL and taking a quick lead in the match. But as the match continued JBL would eventually take the win pinning Mat. Over all an ok match to start things off. 6/10

2. MEXICOOLS vs. MNM-following a segment showing a certain female manager giving it up to Batista, we see PSICOSIS & SUPER CRAZY seeking the same treatment. After they are blown off we have a great match between them and MNM. In one of the best matches of the night we see the Mexicools lose when they really should have won. They definitely were they better team, not to say that MNM isn't a good team because they are. But the stars of this nice match was the Mexicools, this match was definitely a highlight of the night. 8/10

3. CHRIS BENOIT vs. BOOKER T [MATCH 4 OF THE BEST OF 7 SERIES FOR THE U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP]-before the match we see a video showing how the title became vacant and how the series came together. We also see Booker T's 3 previous victories in the series, 2 of the three were because of outside interference from his wife SHARMELL. As this match starts for the most part Book is in control for the most part, but once Chris starts in on the offense the match goes back and forth till an eventual victory by Benoit. The match its self is a pretty good match, and it also looks painful as hell when Benoit falls from the top rope after reversing a superplex. Even though the match is a really good match I still prefer their best of seven in WCW for a shot at the lost & forgotten T.V. title. 8/10

Next we have the G.M. Teddy Long come out and thank the crowd for their support. Then all of a sudden VITO & NUNZIO come out as Santa and his Elf, it is pretty funny when they give out the coal. After they complain about always giving and never receiving, they are greeted by the BOOGEYMAN, who destroys both of them and stuffs worms down Vito's mouth.

4. LASHLEY vs. WILLIAM REGAL & PAUL BURCHILL [2 ON 1 HANDICAP MATCH]-this match surprised me a lot as Regal and Burchill actually control a good portion of the match. I was expecting Lashley to destroy them, at least run through Burchill. But to my surprise the 2 turned out to be good competition for Lashley. But as I expected Lashley came out to be victorious in the end after a Dominater. 7.5/10

5. JUVENTUD vs. KID KASH [CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH]-this like the other match involving members of the Mexicools surprised me. To my surprise after an ok match Juventud lost not only the match but the title as well. I must say I was a little disappointed when the Kid won the match. The match started slowly but worked its way into a faster paced match, and after a head buster Kid Kash got the pin. 7/10

6. BATISTA & REY MYSTERIO vs. KANE & BIG SHOW [SMACKDOWN TAG TEAM CHAMPS vs. RAW TAG TEAM CHAMPS]-after a video showing how this match came about we are treated to an inter-promotional match pitting Raw vs. Smackdown. This match starts out pretty slow with Batista mixing it up with Big Show, but once Rey is tagged in things pick up as Rey tries his hardest to take out Show and Kane. As the match moves along showcasing the talents of all involved it ends when Kane choke slams Rey after catching him in the air, and throwing him over his back. While this match was a very good match it wasn't the classic I thought it would be. 9/10

7. UNDERTAKER vs. RANDY ORTON [HELL IN A CELL]-this match was definitely the highlight of the evening. After a great entrance into the match Taker went on the offensive and pretty much controlled most of the match. I love the fact that everyone got busted open during this match, first Randy Orton and soon following would be Bob Orton, the ref and Taker himself. The match its self was pretty violent but not as hardcore as I thought it would be. In fact the march wasn't as long as I thought it would be, but it still was an excellent match. 10/10

So after viewing this WWE event again I must say that it was better then I had expected, but still wasn't as good as the RAW events.",1137715200,,4654,4.356401384083045

Surprisingly, a pretty good match. nice back and forth action with MNM picking up the victory.

  Chris Benoit vs Booker T

Very good match. Would have liked to have seen more offense from Kash, but he wins with a Brainbuster. New Champ!

6. Champions vs Champions Match:

Batista and Rey Mysterio vs Kane and Big Show

Pretty good match. Batista had a legit injury during this match so it was almost a handicap match. Kane and the Big Show win when Kane chokeslams Rey.

7. Hell In A Cell:

Bad Opener. This was more of a filler for the PPV. Hardy didn't even fight back, it was all JBL.

MnM vs. Mexicools

Not bad. I wanted to see the Mexicools win the tag titles. But however Batista and Rey won them the night before. But it's still a fun match.

Winner- Chris Benoit

Batista & Rey Mysterio vs Big Show & Kane

The 2nd best match. FINALLY RAW wins an SD vs. RAW match. This is what it should have been at Survivor Series with Batista & Rey as the only guys left standing for SD, NOT RANDY ORTON. I was hoping that after it would be Taker vs. Batista after the PPV, but NO. Instead they bring Mark Henrey back so Taker can't get a title shot.

Winners- Big Show and Kane of RAW.

Hell in a Cell, Undertaker vs. Randy Orton- Best match of the night. Finally, Taker is back in Hell in a Cell. After Vengence. I got tried of Triple H in HIAC. All his matches were the same. This match wasn't as brutal as it should have been. But nice chair shots to Orton's skull. This was the first time since 2002 that the door to HIAC was open. To bad they didn't go outside. I was happy to see that !@$!$!$ Randy Orton lost. I hate him for direspecting Eddie on his tribute night when he and his dad attack Cena when that night was about respect.

Its stupid little segments like this that can highly damage a PPV. This did so as its time wasted and entertainment given was a very poor balance to make this a failure of a segment that irritated me entirely.

RATING: 55/100

Randy Orton vs. Undertaker

An outstanding main event to an erratic PPV.

Undertaker, hell in a cell, 30 minutes; are all aspects that make this match as good as it was. Only problems were that they didn't go on top when the opportunity arose (when the door had to open for the ref to leave they could have left the cell). And also I would have loved to have seen Undertaker end the match by doing more of a high impact move such as a Last Ride through the table or a Tombstone on a chair. Outstanding match still

RATING: 95/100

74% - This PPv had potential to touch Vengeance, but failed to do so because of erratic matches and bad segments. The main event gave this PPv the rating it got and Booker vs. Benoit also helped.

2439685,2,B000BSZAGA,"1. JBL vs Matt Hardy

This match was pretty much a glorified squash, and while some people don't like the fact that Hardy was the sacrificial lamb, JBL getting the win over a semi credible guy was necessary. If they do decide to stick with this feud, it does establish Hardy as the major underdog. Again, nothing more here than a glorified squash *3/4

2. MNM vs Mexicools

I didn't mind this match all in all. Some nifty spots and i'm really starting to take to MNM as a team. Stinks a bit that the tag titles were taken out of the equation all for a cheap line a week before the show. Good match with some decent spots **.

3. Best Of Seven Series Match(Match 4)--US Championship

Am I the only one who noticed that WWE spoiled the match during Benoit's entrance and you can see the '1' on Benoit's part of the scoreboard?

Regardless this was the best match of the series in a runaway. Very exciting stuff between these two and for the first time all series, they really built on things that had been done in their three previous encounters. Great stuff and probobly one of the two matches of the night ***1/2.

4. Handicap Match:

Bobby Lashley vs William Regal and Paul Burchill

Total squash match here. Lashley keeps his winning streak alive *

5. Cruiserweight Championship:

Kid Kash vs Juventud

This unfortunately came after the Tim White segment. In what seemed like a spoiled crowd that refused to pop for anything all night, they literally almost chanted at this match to the point where there was little excitement left. Too bad, because there was some respectable action going on here. Good to see Kash win the title. Finally the WWE has a guy who can work their style and still be a solid CW that fans will watch. **1/4

6. Champions vs Champions Match:

Batista and Mysterio vs Kane and Big Show

A lot of fun although i'd have a problem calling it GOOD. Rey really plays the baby face in peril well and ends up, as expected, as the human pin ball in this match. Batista's aura is getting to be pretty impressive and there's some genuine star power beginning to shine through. Fun match and Rey gets planted with a choke slam. **3/4

7. Hell In A Cell:

Randy Orton vs Undertaker

I guess I'd have to say this really typified the night. It was flat. Throughout the match I was pleased to see them really get the point of the match (being IN the cell, not all over it) but then they killed that with the ludacris ending. With the build being around all the violent brutal spots Taker has brought us in HIAC, I thought the match just didn't live up to what it was billed as. Granted, nothing was too ridiculous, but if you're going to build up a match's impending violence to the point where a guy 'kills' himself at the thought of it, and you don't deliver, it's bound to be dissapointing. Taker goes over as expected, but puts on a flat performance. The previous three matches were more enjoyable I felt. **3/4

OVERALL: C- -- I just thought this show was terribly flat and didn't deliver what it had been promising. Slapping the tag belts on Rey and batista for a week proved to be pointless and the HIAC just didn't live up to the hype WWE promised us. The matches that were somewhat decent were killed by a flat crowd. Not the best offering of the year.",1136160000,,3274,4.408637873754153
2439686,2,B000BSZAGA,"The major downfall of this PPV was that both Eddie Guerrero and Ken Kennedy were not on the card.  Kennedy, the WWE's hottest new comer, has been sidelined with an injury.  That is greatly unfortuante.  Eddie Guerrero passed away last month, and the wrestling fans miss him dearly.  This is actually the first SD exclusive PPV to not have Eddie on the card and his presence was missed greatly.

This PPV also had two extremely lame non wrestling segments.  The Santa segment could have easily been left out in favor of another match (LOD vs. The Dicks, Paul London vs. Simon Dean, Paul London/Brian Kendrick vs. The FBi, Orlando Jordan vs. Hardcore Holly.  Use your imagination) Another really dumb segment was the one in which former refereee Tim White committed suicide.  Definately one of the worst angles of the year.

Matches

1- JBL vs. Hardy - Greatly disappointing.  I'm a fan of both guys, and I know they could put on a good match, but for some reason it was booked to be a squash.  JBL pretty much destroyed Hardy.  Granted I think JBL should have gone over, but they could have at least made the match more competitive.

2- MNM vs. The Mexicools - This match was hurt by the fact that MNM lost the tag titles right before the PPV.  Defiantely a stupid call on the bookers' part.  However, both teams are good and were able to have a good tag match.  MNM won, thank heavens.

3 - Benoit vs. Booker - This match was the seventh time these two have wrestled each other in the last few months, even though this is only match four in the best of seven.  Their matches are great, but I can see people getting sick of it.  I hope I'm wrong as their matches are highly entertaining.  This was actually the best of the series so far.  There was a lot of drama since Benoit was down 3-0 and people actually thought that Booker might win it.  Good job there.  This great match was a definate highlight of the show.

4- Lashley vs. Burchill/Regal - This was a fun little filler.  I wish they had hyped it on Smackdown though.  I really like Lashley.  He's got the Goldberg thing going for him, and I hope WWE keeps on the slow build that he's on right now.  Having him get pinned at Survivor Series was a mistake, so giving him this match almost amkes up for it.  I really like Burchill to.  I see alot of potential in him.

5- Juvi vs. Kid Kash - Unfortuantely, this match had to follow that dreadful Tim White segment.  The crowd was upset over that segmetn and took out their anger on these guys.  Chants of ""boring"" and ""end this match"" were heard throughout the bout.  This match bombed.

6- Batista/Rey vs. Big Show/Kane - I really enjoyed this match.  Batista's star power was made clear in this match as his very presence helped bring the crowd back into the show.  All four guys did their job well, and I liked watching Batista match power with the giants.  The Raw team won, which is good since Raw has lost almost every crossbrand match this year.  This was a pretty good match.

7- Undertaker vs. Orton Hell in a Cell: Great match.  Taker and Orton have been having great matches all year long and this was a good way to cap it off.  The two guys really took it to each other and there were some nice spots despite the fact that the match was kept entirely inside the cell.  This match was the major gem of the PPV.

There were some good matches on this show, but the sheer stupidity in some of the booking brought this show down big time.  This isn't Smackdown at their worst by any means (check out J-Day 04, GAB 04, and Arm 04) But the stupid booking just upsets me.  Taker/Orton, Booker/Benoit, MNM/Mexicools, and the Raw/SD tag match were all good, and it's a shame that the hard work in those matches goes somewhat unappreciated because of something stupid that the writers do.",1135900800,3,3795,4.402017291066282

2439691,5,B000BSZAGA,"1/ Teddy Long and SmackDown! suck

-What did Teddy Long do to deserve being Smackdown GM? If you guys still remember the night he was announced as GM, everybody hated him. He hasn't done one good thing for SmackDown. Now the upcoming pay per view is No way out, sm has no good talents so they have to take Kane to be the main eventer with that stupid champ Batista. This batista is not the batista we had seen in Evolution. The changed, not an animal anymore. And hes got a back injury, he cant carry smackdown. If Vince is a little more smart, bring HHH to Smackdown, instead of creating feud with the Big Show. THE ONLY LEGEND ON SMACKDOWN NOW IS THE UNDERTAKER !!!!

2/John Cena sucks

-in the taboo tuesday main event, HBK kicked out of a angle slam from the top rope. AND HE CAN'T KICK OUT OF A STUPID F.U.

-JOhn cena is still champ because he's making money for Vince McManhon.-

-the stupid McManhon family is turning WWE into a joke. This is wrestling, not a rapping competition

-John Cena can't wrestle, his moves suck

Those are the reasons why you stupid people should stop cheering for John Cena and start booing his @$$.

We miss Eric Bishoff

One more thing, HBK is the one who deserves to be the champ the most, hes been working his @$$ off for this company since his return but he's still behind. Your stupid McManhon

2439692,3,B000BSZAGA,"I attended the show in Providence mostly because of the Hell in a Cell.  The Hell in a Cell was good, butI was hoping for some action on top of the Cell.  Some of the other matchea were decent, but none of them great.

As far as the crowd reaction to the Cruiserweight Title match, it's possible the match wasn't as bad on TV. While I wasn't one of the people chanting ""Boring "" or ""End this Match,"" I will say that in person, this match was somewhat boring.

I will buy this pay-per-view on DVD, but only because I was there, otherwise I'd say it isn't a pay-per-view worth watching again.",1135468800,,590,4.241071428571429
2439693,5,B000BSZAGA,"This was my first Smackdown PPV I've ever bought before it hit DVD shelves.  I have to admit Smackdown did a good job with this PPV.

1) JBL vs. Matt Hardy- 5/10-  I really didn't care much for this. Like others, I was expecting more out of these two.  I hope this is just the start of a feud between the two and Matt Hardy can get more than 10 moves on JBL.

2) Mexicools vs. MNM- 9/10- Great Tag Team Match. Both teams were great and really made the match worth watching. I would have started the PPV with this match.

3) Booker T vs. Chris Benoit- 10/10-  A classic encounter between these two. Benoit always brings his A game and Booker T does so more often than not.  Sharmell was an nice element to the match and helps Booker T's gimmick a lot in my mind.  Booker will be a World Champion by 2006's end, I hope.

4) Lashley vs. Regal/Burchill- 7/10- Good for what it was....a filler match.  Nice to see Regal on a PPV even if it is to do a J.O.B.

5) Kid Kash vs. Juvi- 8/10- I don't know what the fans in Providence were on, but I liked this match. There was very little not to like about it. My two complaints are the match should have been given a little bit more time (5 minutes or so) and the wrestlers should have just flat out gone at it up to their capabilities.  But other than that, I liked this match.

6) Rey/Batista vs. Kane/Big Show- 8/10- One of the main reasons I got the PPV.  Good match, albeit a little short. Big Show's overhand chops have got to hurt.  The Raw guys needed to win a interpromotional match and finally did.  Good effort by all four, especially an injured Batista.  Batista is an animal for wrestling with that injury.

7) Orton vs. Undertaker- Hell in a Cell- 10/10-  Great Hell in a Cell match. Orton was great in this match, both in wrestling and in character.  And what else can be said about Undertaker?  15 years since his WWE debut and he is still giving top quality matches.  If this is to be the last time Taker enters Hell in a Cell, it was a great match to look back on.

Overall, my hat's off to Smackdown.  Great PPV and great announcing.  Two comments:  The Boogeyman gimmick is dumb and the Tim White thing was almost worse than Vince's comments at Survivor Series.",1135296000,,2221,4.2137767220902616
2439694,4,B000BSZAGA,"It wasn't what I'd expected, but it wasn't that bad.

Match #1: JBL vs. Matt Hardy - 6/10.

OK match, but very short. Expected more of these two.

Match #2: MnM vs. Mexicools - 7.9/10.

Awesome match between the teams.

Match #3: Best out of Seven Series, Match #4: United States Championship - 8.6/10.

The middle was kind of slow, but the ending was marvelous. Best match of their series so far.

Match #4: Handicap Match: Paul Burchill & William Regal vs. Bobby Lashley - 6.7/10.

A basic squash, but cool.

Match #5: Cruiserweight Championship: Kid Kash vs. Juventud - 7.2/10

This match had lots of ""boring"" chants throughout the match, but the match wasn't very disappointing. Decent.

Match #6: RAW vs. SmackDown! Champions vs. Champions: Kane & Big Show vs. Batista & Rey Mysterio - 7.8/10

This match was short, I'd expected it to be longer, but it was pretty good.

Match #7: Hell in a Cell: The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - 8.2/10

Very brutal, this match was. Had lots of cool spots including the sick chair shot to Orton courtesy of Taker, Orton reversing and hitting the Tombstone, etc. Would of been better if they went on top of the cell, which I pretty much think that it was what everybody was waiting for. But overall a great match, lasting 30 minutes.

Overall PPV Rating: 51.4/70. Grade: C. Nice way to end the year, but I believe this PPV could of been better.

Booker T vs. Chris Benoit

Match 4 out of 7 Series

This was do or die for Benoit since he is losing 3-0.  Let me just say this in my opinion is their best match yet.  Amazing match and it gets real exciting at the end.

9/10

Boogeyman Segment

Long and Palmer come out talking about Christmas and whatever, I don't really care, they decided to bring out ""Santa"" and his little elf, which was Vito and Nunzio as the elf.  Pretty stupid stuff until Boogeyman comes out.  I think he is a horrible wrestler but he is funny as crap.  He basically beats the hell out of them which leads to some real nasty stuff at the end...disgusting

Bobby Lashley vs. William Regal and Paul Burchill

Squash match.  I didn't really pay attention.  William regal has some talent but didn't really use it in this match, Vince just tried to get Lashley over.

4/10

Tim White Segment

Josh Matthews is at some local bar in Providence in which he interviews Tim White which was a referee in a HIAC match with HHH vs. Jericho.  Jericho did a spot where he hit the ref and he flew and hit the cage.  He broke his arm and made him retire.  White just kept drinking and staring until he pulled out a shotgun.  Matthews said they were leaving while White leaves the camera scene.  Matthews starts screaming ""White no no no don't do it"" when all of a sudden....BOOM

Cruiserweight Championship

Kid Kash vs. Juventud

Good match.  Kid Kash was held back alot in TNA but they used him well in this match. Some high spots but I expected more high flying action.  Not bad though. The end kinda saved this match.

Batista and Rey Mysterio vs. Big Show and Kane

Champions vs. Champions

This match was good.  It would of been alot better if Batista wasn't injured but the match was still good.  Highlight of the match in my opinion was at the end with a CRAZY-ASS chokelsam from Kane to Rey.

Randy Orton vs. Undertaker

THIS MATCH WAS THE BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT.  It was spectacular with both men giving wonderful performances.  This match will keep you at the edge of your seat guaranteed.

Match of the Year rite here. Should be brutal with tons of weapons. Hope they go on top of the cell. They showed all thes videos of Taker throwin people off the cell on tv + internet, so don't be surprised if they go on top. How bout a RKO from the cell to the announce table! Thats probably askin for too much. But should be great

Winner: Taker to set up one last title run

2.  WWE Tag Team Champions Batista & Rey Mysterio vs. World Tag Team Champions Big Show & Kane  9/10

Should be good. Expect Batista to be taken out early by a big move and Rey caring most the work. Show and Kane work great together, but hopefully they break up to set up a brutal fued.  Don't be surprised to see HHH

Winner: Rey, with Batista finishin them off at the end

3.  Hardy v.s. JBL  8/10

Nice match to keep both superstars involved in the ppv. They need to use Hardy more, hopefully he gets a US title run.

6.  WWE Cruiserweight Title: Juvetund vs. Kid Kash  9/10

2nd best match of the nite, great action. If the WWE uses the Cruiserweight division more with more fueds it could turn into TNA's X division.  Juvy, London, Spanky are X division quality wrestlers.

7.  Handicapped Match: William Regal & Paul Birchall vs. Lashley  7/10

Hopefully Lashley actually gets tested here. Regal is a quality wrestler, don't just use him to make Lashley look good. He needs a real fued or title run soon

MNM VS Mexicools-A very good tag team match. I remember going see Smackdown live and saw a couple of the guys from Mexicools at Quiznos.

Booker T VS Chris Beniot: I've yet to watch a full Beniot match since the murder/suicide. Booker can sweep the series with a win tonight, so that gave away the ending.

Bobby Lashley VS William Regal and Paul Burchill: I never liked Lashley since the first time I saw him at back to back house shows. Lashley beating two veterans in under five minutes? Ah, always looking for the next big star. Nothing but filler.

I've always said that since the draft, Smackdown has always had the best talent and put on better shows. That being said, the next skit on this dvd was horrible. Former ref Tim White was injuried in a hell in the cell match and he retired and apparently everyone including his family hates him for it. Considering the match took place over three years ago, well it's plain stupid. Tim White then goes off camera and we hear a shot. The stupid annoucer stands don't do that and when he shoots himself, he doesnt look shocked. This was beyond bad and something they should have never done. Why the hell would you put a suicide on a wrestling ppv?

Kid Kash VS Juventud: A decent match that the crowd didn't care for.

Kane and Big Show VS Batista and Rey Mysterio: A short, disappointing match.
