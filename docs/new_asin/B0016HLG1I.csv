8262625,4,B0016HLG1I,I am a big fan of the 1960's animation of technical imagination.  This 5 episode DVD satisfies my need for this early adventure.  The video quality is poor and the audio is fair.  It reminds me of a Betamax recording.  I wish it was a more professional quality product but I got what I wanted.  A few episodes of this series.,1341100800,,325,4.262295081967213
