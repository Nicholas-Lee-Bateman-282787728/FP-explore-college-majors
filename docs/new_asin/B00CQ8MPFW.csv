5734623,5,B00CQ8MPFW,I can highly recommend this DVD - its content is divided into approximately 20 min parts. The instructions are clear and I really like the way the DVD has been made.,1393804800,,165,4.354838709677419
5734624,5,B00CQ8MPFW,I really like this video. It focuses on exercises to keep your abdominal muscles in shape to help support your baby and exercises for good posture. It is a relaxing and stress free way to exercise.,1377907200,2,197,4.5
8584905,5,B00CQ8MPFW,"I had back surgery last June and have been afraid of trying workout DVD's because of how rigorous they are. This was great. I could still make my own modifications when needed, and over all it was a lot like my PT that I did after my surgery. Not to mention the gal doing them was pleasant and not obnoxious.",1490227200,,308,4.15
8584906,4,B00CQ8MPFW,It's pretty good. Give it a try,1470787200,,31,3.5714285714285716
8584907,2,B00CQ8MPFW,I am not an exercising person at all and I didn't feel this was very challenging and I was bored.,1457136000,,97,3.9
8584908,3,B00CQ8MPFW,a little to light for my taste but I would guess good for someone that doesn't really exercise,1456272000,,94,4.277777777777778
8584909,5,B00CQ8MPFW,"I love this DVD so much.  I have done the mat workout and the total body workout, and both were amazing.  Caroline is a wonderful instructor, and her voice is extremely pleasant to listen to.  She instructs via voice-over, which I really like.  There's a short tutorial (3-4 minutes) that is definitely worth watching before you start, and the pregnancy solutions section has a lot of helpful stuff! Included in that section are routines for Headache and Shoulder Tension, Pelvic Floor, Anxiety, Backache, Tired Legs and Swollen Ankles, and Anytime Swollen Ankles. The main routines are the perfect length--about 20 minutes each--so you feel like you get a good workout without zapping what little energy you have. I found the routines to be both gentle AND challenging.  One thing that bugs me about New Shoot DVDs (and this happens with all their stuff that I've used) is that the routines are never titled with anything other than ""Workout 1"", ""Workout 2"", etc. So for other people's reference, on this DVD Workout 1 is the mat workout, Workout 2 is the total body workout, and Workout 3 is the standing workout.",1453420800,3,1115,4.847368421052631
8584910,5,B00CQ8MPFW,"Great workouts--three 20 minute, complete workouts. These can be done separately or stacked together. There's a warm-up included in each segment, so if want to roll out of bed and jumpstart my day, these moves are simple to follow, but gentle enough to get my day started on the right foot. Fantastic! I've used other prenatal pilates workouts and wondered if they were truly geared towards a pregnant woman. All three of these workouts are fantastic and my body felt it after the first round.",1450569600,,493,4.811764705882353
8584911,5,B00CQ8MPFW,"Love this dvd exactly what I was looking for after my prenatal yoga studio closed down. Love it, Love it!!! Also I'm at the beginner level, but not overweight or obese, just a good healthy weight due to my diet and not so much exercise so if you identify with this, I highly recommend it.",1436227200,,288,4.254545454545455
8584912,1,B00CQ8MPFW,"Very slow, more suited for people who need something very gentle.",1435017600,,65,5.0
8584913,5,B00CQ8MPFW,"Great workout! Its just enough to get a good workout without feeling like your over doing it, especially towards the end of your pregnancy. I feel long and lean, and refreshed afterward.",1425427200,,186,4.84375
8584914,5,B00CQ8MPFW,"Great workout video. I have two little ones so the 20 minute workout fits perfect in my schedule. This video, 10 minute solutions prenatal pilates and slim and tone are the three videos in my exercise rotation.  Since week 5 I haven't missed a morning of exercise and I am 19 weeks now.  Each of the threevideos offer something different. This one is great if I am really feeling pregnant it helps with all aches and pains.  Of the three its probably my favorite because her accent is so soothing and calm. Perfect for an AM workout with two littles ones running around.",1406678400,6,570,4.514563106796117
