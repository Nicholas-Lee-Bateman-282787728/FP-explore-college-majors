5716040,5,B00CDAG0WW,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BBC VERSION OF BEING HUMAN MUCH BETTER THAN THE AMERICAN VERSION. IF YOU ARE A VAMPIRE BUFF-THIS IS A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOW!,1374451200,2,146,4.88
5716041,5,B00CDAG0WW,I love it...never thought I could love the new characters as much as the original but I really do! Don't understand why they are ending it after only one season of the new guys.,1374451200,,177,4.235294117647059
5716042,5,B00CDAG0WW,"Note that these are my thoughts on season five itself since I've already seen it. The DVD has not been released at the time of this writing, so I can't comment on the DVD extras.

Although I thought Season 4 was a bit rough (understandably, considering it was a character transition period), Season 5 definitely more than makes up for it.

Season five of Being Human recaptures the wonderful balance of humor and drama of season one, with a slight difference-- while Mitchell, George, and Annie seemed to have their own separate storylines that eventually meshed together, Hal, Tom, and Alex's stories are more intertwined from the start. This seems trivial until you see how close friends Hal, Tom, and Alex are in comparison with Mitchell, George, and Annie. Both groups are friends living together, but new trio seem inseparable compared to the original. They're all in it together-- Hal and his struggle with bloodlust and readjusting after 55 years of isolation from the outside world, Tom by his side also trying to live a 'normal' life having been raised as a nomadic, vampire-hunting werewolf, and Alex, who is still trying to come to grips with life as a ghost after her death (which Hal is tangentially related to). In spite of each character's unique condition, their day-to-day struggles still seem familiar with our own.

This season is the first and, unfortunately, only season in which we see these three characters together on their own, with no 'baggage' (characters from episodes before and during the cast transition). It's a pity the show was axed to make room for other experimental shows on BBC 3, since the chemistry between the new trio is phenomenal and they still have a lot of potential with their stories. Though Hal, Tom, and to an extent, Alex's characters have already been established in the previous season, they're given more depth through backstories. You're shown glimpses of their former lives, who they used to be, and how far they've come. Even the secondary characters are very well developed in the episode(s) they're in.

The season arc is enjoyable and the overall pacing of this season is much better compared to season 3 or season 4. The finale is excellent, heartbreaking, and somewhat controversial.

To those who haven't gone past season 3 because of the character change, you owe it to yourselves to make it through season 4 (for background understanding) so you can watch this season. Sure, Mitchell is still missed, but Damien Molony does a fantastic job at playing Hal, whose personality is very different from Mitchell's-- it's clear that the writers did not want a Mitchell 2.0. Once you realize Tom isn't as naive as he appears, you also see that he's incredibly loyal and selfless. He's the heart of the group. Alex is, well, the soul of the group. Her fiery, snarky attitude is almost reminiscent of Amy Pond or Donna Noble from Doctor Who. She has a very active personality, which serves as one of the catalysts for the overall season arc. Hal and Tom's bromance easily rivals George and Mitchell's.

To those who aren't familiar with this show, or have only seen the Syfy remake-- consider giving this a shot. Each season ranges from 6-8 episodes, which means the plot is more condensed than what you'd expect with US shows, so things get a lot darker a lot faster (especially during the 3rd season). It's far more character-driven than the North American version.

Most TV shows tend to overstay their welcome and become stagnant. Cast changes are not usually handled very well. Being Human Season Five demonstrates that this show still has so much life left in it and is an excellent example on how to have an entire cast overhaul without destroying the heart of the show. It's a season (and show) well worth watching.",1367625600,41,3779,4.8496124031007755

5716044,3,B00CDAG0WW,The last couple seasons weren't near as good as the first few. With the changing characters I wasn't sure if it would even keep my interest. I have to say its not the new actors that disappoint but the lackinv plot and twists. It kinda felt like they were throwing it together just to have a final season. Just my two cents. That being said I would recommend it if you have been faithful to the series through the first four seasons. You have to see it through.,1472601600,4,461,4.25

Even when the characters were changed up, the new actors were just as affecting, their connection just as funny, and just as touching. Who would have thought the show could be as good after they replaced the three originals. My favorite line? ""Please kill me.""

5716075,4,B00CDAG0WW,"Caught all of the first four seasons on BBC America when they came out and had the 5th season dvr'd and never got around to watching because I wasn't sure I was going to like ""Being Human 2.0"", Saw it on Amazon and decided to watch a couple of years after it came out and it was not as bad I thought it was going to be. Binged watch the whole series in a day and thought that it had a satisfying conclusion to the series (can't really talk about the ending without spoilers!). Still prefer the original cast and the earlier seasons, but this one was light years better than the American Syfy version that I only made it through a few episodes.

5716083,5,B00CDAG0WW,"Loved the entire series. I watched them unfold on SciFi until the end of season 4. I couldn't imagine a more perfect ending. After watching all of Being Human US and enjoying the ending so very much, but made me sad too because it was the end of another wonderful series, I decided I needed to watch the entire UK series again and tack on season 5 because I was curious how it ended. The first few episodes I wasn't so sure I would like it. I did like Tom, but Hal and Alex were taking their own sweet time warming up. When Hal killed the werewolf in Pie & Prejudice I decided he was not all sissyboy and I could get to like him. I loved the whole hotel theme and by the last show, I was hooked, savoring the last bit and wishing for more, but pleased that season 5 held it's own and wasn't lame final season of an otherwise successful series. Season 5 could conceivably have been its own miniseries and done well. The only things it had in common with the previous 4 seasons was the title, the town/home, and a ghost/wolf/vamp combo. All in all Well done.",1404086400,,1056,4.206896551724138

5716086,5,B00CDAG0WW,I enjoyed the main characters and could almost believe they were my personal friends.  I also thought the music that was selected to go with other characters was cleverly chosen. I find myself watching the DVD frequently as my American ear has a hard time understanding some of the British actors' dialogue.

5716087,5,B00CDAG0WW,"This has been such an interesting show from the start. Even with the cast changes and re appearance of past charterers (who doesn't like a cheeky teen vampire who thinks he's a heartthrob?) it still is a surprising show. Far better than the America version, but generally the originals usually are. It has that hint of Alfred Hitchcock, more suspense and timing than over the top gore. It would be great if the web spin off was available on DVD as well as I can only hope it will be. But Being Human delivers as a must see show.",1401408000,,528,4.343434343434343

Toby Whithouse (creator & writer) puts so much detail into the story and the characters take it from their.  I hope in time somehow Toby can find a way to make it return to BBC.

5716103,5,B00CDAG0WW,"I enjoyed series 1-3. I thought series 4 would probably decline in quality due to the loss of almost the entire original cast. As it turned out, the show actually got better, and I was much looking forward to Series 5. Unfortunately, it was unavailable on Netflix and I got tired of waiting for it, so I bought the DVD, which I generally consider a waste of money. I've only ever bought one television series before and I did not think to keep this one after I'd watched it.

I more than got my money's worth. I think the main story arc is rather weak and silly, to be frank, but the character-driven nature of this series compensates for this and then some. All three main characters are engaging in their roles, but Damien Molony really stands out as he paints a magnificently sympathetic portrait of a very frightened, but very brave man struggling to resist the evil within him, with the help of his friends. His performance as Hal is so strong, the 5th series really ends up being more about his struggle than anything else.

The three principals, Molony, Michael Socha, and Kate Bracken have rather brief CV's, which might suggest a lack of experience. You certainly would never think so however, based on their performances. I cannot recommend this series highly enough and I certainly will not be getting rid of mine. As a matter of fact, I've already ordered series 4 (the first half of Hal's story) and probably will get the whole series. It's ""brilliant craic."" Buy this DVD.

5716116,4,B00CDAG0WW,"I watched BH-UK from start to finish here on Amazon. It was an interesting take on what it is to be human. If supernaturals existed, how would they try to live their lives as normal as possible, and what exactly constitutes ""normal"" and what is it to be ""human.""  We work, we play, we love. And the supernaturals did that in their own way.  Perhaps what makes us human is simply our need for other humans. I liked how they never gave up on one another.

I loved the seasons with Annie, George and Mitchell. The cast work so well together and were so good at crying! George! They were definitely more emotional than 4 and 5.  I was hesitant to continue viewing once they'd all been written out of the show but after reading other's reviews decided to give it a go.

The formula for the show was always the same even if the cast changed and I think that really worked in its favor.  The story lines were still interesting enough and plot moved along, sometimes with filler episodes, but always to a resolution.

It was a very interesting ending and I feel it was the perfect way to end the series. Being Human.",1391212800,,1108,4.349514563106796

5716120,3,B00CDAG0WW,"If you have seen the first 4 season of Being Human (UK version), than of course you should watch Season 5.

There are some very good episodes (""Men with Sticks and Rope"" most notably).

But overall there was just too much about ""being supernatural"" that took this season away from where earlier seasons (particularly the first 2) had gone into interesting places with unique character development, etc.  Of course the complete changing of the cast has a lot to do with that.

It's not that the new actors are bad...they just really weren't given as interesting story lines as Mitchell, Annie, and George had.

The whole thing about Hatch being the Devil just became silly and campy.
And there are just way to many contradiction about supernatural powers...especially regarding ghosts, and about fighting the devil.

Rook could have (and in my opinion) should have gone in a totally different direction...maybe he was meant to but the seductive powers of the devil led him astray...this would have been consistent with the other plot lines, but Rook never seemed to be on that track anyway, it's like they had already planned for him to go bad, so they didn't bother making him likable.

Natasha was a great character, for the brief time that she was on the show.  Great back story...but of again a total contradiction of the ""No Care, All Responsibility"" mantra.  It would have been great if she were introduced sooner...that would have made her death more shocking and impactful....instead she was just a cool character introduced in a way that made you know that she was just pretty cannon fodder.

Lastly, the ending just sucked.  Not only was it completely unsatisfying, it was another contradiction...or not a contradiction, than it's not just a loose end that they left, but rather they shredded the tapestry, for no good reason.",1389830400,2,1835,4.906148867313916

I never really got into Hal, and I guess that is why I didn't find this season engaging. I did feel like the writers were grasping a bit with the whole devil thing... The other old ones died and they couldn't just work, show Tom how to be more ""human"" etc. nope, they needed to add the devil and a weird secret government branch that covers up super naturals... where was that in season 2 when ya needed it?  that wasn't involved the show was pretty enjoyable.

5716139,4,B00CDAG0WW,"Oh well.
After the wonderful first three seasons, Being Human not only lost the great chemistry among the characters, it lost its way.
Season 4 was still a great TV show - it still had Annie and a storyline that carried over from the earlier episodes.
Season 5 is sort of a reboot.
The issue with this season is, in my humble opinion, the characters here are not in great personal and private conflict over how to stay human.  Hal has been doing fine for decades, with his method, so he just wants to stay the way he is.  Tom, as a werewolf, only has a problem once a month, which is the reason why no werewolf shows (TV or movie) are quite as compelling as vampire show which deal with constant hunger - and he doesn't have a conflict here because, well, he has nothing to be conflicted over.  He is content as a character, which makes him very boring.  And the ghost - unlike Annie, she has no delusion about her demise, so there is no personal story to explore there.
So, with the characters having no compelling issues of their own, the focus shifts to Devil and government bureaucrats. Which makes a very good entertainment, but it is not up to the standard set by the first three seasons.
All in all, I did enjoy Season 5, but it came off as a disappointment after the wait of a year. I am glad I don't have to wait for another year. RIP, Being Human.",1379721600,2,1357,4.2684824902723735

The characters go completely off of what they were originally some people may think that's growing as a character I don't think it is also when Nina got killed they completely skipped her ending, as if we wouldn't know or no one wanted to see it, I enjoyed the original characters I enjoyed the show I love most precious things anyway cuz my mom is Brit born in UK and then to find out that George died the way he did was heartbreaking but it sometimes seems to cross over into a serious show almost like the X-Files that it goes back to being kind of funny but I guess when you get done watching it all it's still pretty good. But I don't think I'll be buying this episode of the seasons because so much has changed about it it takes away the familiarity of it it's like that dumb Americans show Friends, when character start to grow and leave it just seems to take away the original feeling of what you had the feeling of dreaming you had friends that were that low loyal that close it just takes it away. I will say this Bravo to the actors because I think you really want the characters to life I enjoy Tom the character the dude with the eyebrows I haven't seen them since Crawford, and George you are exceptional at your change that scream was so unisex that's fabulous.
