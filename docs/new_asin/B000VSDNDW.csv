I am a huge and dedicated fan of this lady. She has it all, a talented songwriter, amazing performer who can mesmerize an audience, not to mention she is beautiful on the inside as well as on the outside. I found this DVD to be informative, yet not going into, or expanding into more of her overall achievements. I realize the DVD keys on Any Man Of Mine, and so taking that into consideration, it is well done in my opinion. It touches briefly on a lot of her key accomplishments.

As a dedicated Shania fan, I would recommend ""Impact! Songs That Changed The World: Shania Twain - Any Man of Mine"" to anyone who is a dedicated fan like myself, or just for anyone who would like to know more about Shania Twain.
