Lily doesn't just parody Las Vegas, she also parodys HERSELF.

The main point is that entertainters are offered HUGE GLOBS of money to play L.V. and wind up ""selling out"".  Lily plays herself as an ""artist"" who would never do something just for the money, but winds up getting suckered into all the glitz and glamour of L.V. and does indeed sell out, a little.  It is a funny special with Lily incorporting her characters brilliantly into the scenes with herself.  If you really watch the show you get how she is poking fun at herself just as well.

I loved this TV special and look forward to it's release on DVD soon.",1095724800,3,798,4.344594594594595
