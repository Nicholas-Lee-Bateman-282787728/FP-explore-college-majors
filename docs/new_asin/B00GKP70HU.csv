6081027,5,B00GKP70HU,"Boys Behind Bars is a fantastic example of a low-budget, fantastic, quality content filled Indie film, with powerful social messages touching on all our deepest fears. So, what can be said about it?!?!?!? Quite a lot as it happens, I think Ill just say a little bit about the characters:

Darrell:  He is THE main character that this story revolves around. It is his cell and everything within it both possessions and people (whether wanted or not) are there for his personal amusement and potential gratification. Hes happy (a relative term) with his situation and is totally comfortable with his social condition. For lack of a better phrase, hes conditioned and totally institutionalised.

Seth: A fellow inmate and friend of Darrell, Seth is constantly reminding himself (and those around him as justification of his stance), that he has a life outside of prison, with family and friends to look forward to seeing and being with. Hes prepared to look after himself but no one else. Its through each act of inaction, that under the surface, he has bit by bit lost his humanity and is as much institutionalised as Darrell. The fact that he joins in with what happens in the cell, to me proves this.

Lanks: He is a very tall and well-built man, who has totally accepted his situation and copes with it, through the familiarity of his surroundings and his possessions. Take that away from him and his coping mechanisms disappear he quickly reverts to aggression and intimidation to achieve domination/control of the people and situation around him. He too is totally conditioned and sees non-aggression and conformity to prison life as a sign of weakness.

Nico: He is a very quiet, non-conditioned inmate (a noobe). He is so new and so young, that he has yet the maturity to deal with the situation he finds himself in, nor has he had the time to develop coping mechanisms. Once he is literally thrown into the mix and he is faced with three very strong characters, he clearly cannot manage and easily succumbs.

 With the four characters in place, one night in Darrells cell whilst in lock-down, you can quickly imagine how the situation develops, particularly without the controlling presence of the prison officers. It is a violent film, but it carries a social commentary that confronts your attitudes toward punishment. Please watch this film, be confronted and from that, form your own opinions and not adopt those of people who just Shout the Loudest! I hope you enjoy this film.",1413244800,6,2488,4.867612293144208

6081031,1,B00GKP70HU,They shot this NO budget movie in a closet or something. The DVD cover...nothing that interesting happens in the movie. Horrific and scary performances. SO BAD. The so-called dialog...pathetic. Couldn't hear most of it. Really and honest to God stay away from this trash!!!!!!!! All those responsible should be banished.,1399420800,10,320,5.42
6081032,1,B00GKP70HU,"There are a lot of DVD's sold to the public that are not worth purchasing even for a dollar. This one was so bad that a penny would have been too much let alone having to pay the shipping cost to ship garbage. Hell, if there were a way for me to get a refund just for the complete lack of art other than the cover of the case I would have requested it. The cover of the case was a complete misrepresentation of that was on the disc in of it's self. Unless you like to spend your hard earned money on a lot of garbage, stay away from this crap. It is so bad that rental companies won't have it listed on their sites. I didn't see one jail bar in the flick and if there were some to be had, they should have been used to put those behind bars that made this garbage. I like a lot of even somewhat bizarre videos but this is way below any of that. Even their crap called a bonus video is so bad that I didn't watch it to the end until I decided to write this review. STAY AWAY. I Promise you will be as disappointed as I am if you should even think about taking a chance on this. Just thinking about getting it isn't worth your time. DON'T waste your time !!!!!",1397433600,13,1158,3.9110169491525424
6081033,3,B00GKP70HU,"If you have the right movie equipment anyone can make a film. This DVD prove that!!! First of all the cover of DVD show that these guy are in jail or some kind of prison, that is not the case. The set It take place in a room with a bed and a block or spayed out window and a bed pan, not a toilet. Please be Caution... These guys are Vulgar too the extreme. Yes Nasty, no John Waters DIVINE campy here. As The British would say.. Rubbish!!!",1394582400,10,440,3.955056179775281
6081034,4,B00GKP70HU,"Darrell (Wade Radford) is a seasoned lag, used to the prison life to the point that he's happy to address the camera and deliver tips on how to cope with being banged up: ""get a masturbation buddy"" he suggests, insisting that all inmates ""think about women ... while f...ing men"".

He is, incidentally, openly homosexual. When we first meet him proper, he's in his cell defecating into a basin, and recovering the drug-stuffed condom that's contained within it. He later explains that his boyfriend sneaked the drugs to him - along with oral sex - during his last visit. In a novel cameo, director Jason Impey features as the boyfriend, in a photograph stuck to Darrell's cell wall.

Darrell just has time to stash his newly acquired cocaine under his mattress when an alarm sounds, suggesting that trouble is stirring on the prison's top wing - you know, where all the nutters and nonces are kept.

This disruption calls for other prisoners to be relocated into different cells while the screws concentrate on quelling the drama on the top floor. First to be shoved into Darrell's cell is Seth (Tama Phethean).

Seth is a quiet, intense type. Despite this, he appears to enjoy a decent rapport with Darrell, despite the latter's unwanted flirtiness. A few minutes later, the oversized Lanks (Gavin Jackson) reluctantly joins them. He's a sulky sort, and in particular he has no time for Seth.

Darrell seems to get on with everyone, on account of his penchant for making light of all situations and constant flirting. It becomes apparent that he has enjoyed sexual relations previously with the otherwise heterosexual Lanks.

But this is going to be a long night for the three lads. It's a small room they're being confined to. Seth and Lanks can't stand each other - that's made clear from the offset. Darrell wants a piece of Seth: he's quite persistent in his pursuit, but Seth is adamant it's not going to happen. And with Darrell's questionable sense of humour - masturbating and rubbing the fresh aftermath in Lanks' face; waving his excrement-stained fingers in front of Seth's nose - this situation seems like one that's just waiting to explode.

Just as tensions start to boil over, a fourth body is chucked into their cell. New inmate Nico (James Whitehurst) is young, scared and perfect bait for Darrell to cosy up beside and prey upon.

Nico is the unwitting catalyst for the violence that will soon erupt...

BOYS BEHIND BARS was directed, co-written, photographed and edited by underground British filmmaker Jason Impey (NAKED NAZI, HOMEMADE, DEMON SCROLL etc). He's churned out some of the most ambitious no-budget British horror fare of the last decade.

But BOYS is a marked change of pace. Shot in long takes and told more or less in real time, the film stages all of its talky drama in a single setting and relies on abrasive humour as much as handheld camerawork to achieve a sense of raw intimacy.

The performances are frequently naturalistic, suggesting a fair amount of both rehearsal and improvisation. At first, it all feels a tad amateurish but the actors quickly warm to their situation and become their characters surprisingly quickly. Jackson's the weak link, as he's not as convincing as the hard nut he's clearly meant to be.

Overall the film works very well, and ably demonstrates Impey's growth as a storyteller. With minimal budget, locations or cast, he's fashioned a tense 83-minute film out of something that could quite easily have ended up being stagy and boring.

In some ways BOYS BEHIND BARS reminded me of Uwe Boll's STOIC. But only in so far as both pit four male characters in a cell, allow for improvisation and contain the action therein.

If you like discovering ultra-low budget films that have the ambition to elicit tension without the need for lashings of gore, BOYS BEHIND BARS is a very good example of script over sensation.

8624176,5,B00GKP70HU,"Basically, Boys Behind Bars is just four man in one prison cell, filmed in just a handful of long takes - and it works quite nicely, too, essentially because it's based on a very interesting and rather explosive situation, without just being vulgar it doesn't shy away from getting dirty (though there's nothing really explicit in here), and it's carried by a quartet of well-drawn and well-played characters.

Now Boys Behind Bars is definitely not a feel-good movie, but if you can accept to be slightly, erm, offended in your sense for ""good taste"", then this is definitely a film to watch!",1422316800,,593,4.813725490196078
