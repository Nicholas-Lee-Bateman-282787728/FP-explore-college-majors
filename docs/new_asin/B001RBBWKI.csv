8337653,5,B001RBBWKI,"This is a great DVD to start with, it has three different basic routines - two balance ball and one pilates floor exercise routine.  I find it a good mix to help keep in shape, nice combination of balance ball and pilates in 30-40 minutes total.  Doesn't take too much of your day but helps you get going and feel better.",1411603200,,321,4.245901639344262
