1177631,5,B0000039BK,"I first saw this film some 15 years ago or so and I can tell you its still a revelation. What's happened to science fiction in the interim since then? This work was based on genuine innovation and a truly original storyline. Unbeknown to men who land on Mars, a civilisation already exists there. One cannot but help drawing parallels between the Martians and the native American indians, destined to be driven from their lands and who also die from human pestilence brought over by the first settlers. I had a new found respect for Rock Hudson after watching this film. Sadly it seems impossible to buy a copy. Why don't they re release it?",1023580800,5,641,4.582608695652174

For a 1979(televised in 1980) made for TV movie this was great!  The chronilogical effect, explorations, colonisations, and revelations.  I first watched it with my Dad when I was 10 or something, now I have a recording from the sci-fi channel.  It is better now than it was when I was 10.",993600000,5,446,4.5125
1177633,5,B0000039BK,"This sprawling miniseries was excellent. I saw it on SciFi channel and taped it, and have watched it again and again. The acting is great, the stories wonderful. Since it was made in the 70s, some people have cited that the special effects suck. Honestly, its like a fly on a mile wide windshield. The effects are obscured by the amazing stories and timeless imagination of Ray Bradbury. My only problem was that the end dragged itself out a bit, but in the end, it didn't matter. I would recommend this movie to all Science Fiction fans because it is a  masterpiece of all trades.",981244800,4,581,4.533333333333333
1177634,5,B0000039BK,"From ITC Entertainment Group and NBC Television comes the greatest mini-series ever created for television. Based on Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel, The Martian Chronicles tells the story about man's first three expeditions to Mars, and what follows past that point. Man's encounter with the dying Martain race and the fact that the Earth is on the brink of self-destruction.
With an astounding all-star cast that consists of Rock Hudson, Barry Morse, Darren McGavin, Nicholas Hammond, Maria Schell, Gayle Hunnicutt, Roddy McDowall, Joyce Van Patten, Richard Oldfield, Phil Brown, Robert Beatty, and countless others, this is, by far, one of the most unique space adventures ever brought to network television. The sets, film locations, costumes, acting, and special effects, are all of excellent quality. And the plot, despite some changes made, is good and solid. Definately a mini-series worth watching. If you enjoy classic science fiction and the works of Ray Bradbury, check this out. It's an introduction to another future that should have been.
Two big bonus points: It was made by a British film corporation and the music soundtrack was spectacular.",971136000,2,1172,5.375
1177635,2,B0000039BK,"A potentially-great miniseries, and one which is quite nostalgic for people in their late-20s, but it's not actually all that good. Essentially,  the book is a masterpiece, but it's a collection of short stories - the  television series might have worked as a 'Twilight Zone' anthology, but by  concentrating on just three stories, stretched out to 45 minutes each (by  Richard Matheson of 'I am Legend' fame), it becomes lengthy and dull. The  acting is solid, but then again the actors don't have much to do. And the  low budget is painfully obvious - whilst the martians are interestingly  designed, the whole thing is too close to 'Doctor Who' for comfort.

Hopefully, the novel will, at last, be brought to life by a great director in a major film studio, that befits such a classic novel.",1510272000,,423,4.7534246575342465

1177641,4,B0000039BK,"I cannot say whether this is a faithful, or even good, adaptation of the book as I've not read it.. yet. As a stand alone film, though, I quite enjoyed it.  I certainly wouldn't have called it ""boring"" as Ray Bradbury said, but then being the creator of the story, he probably had his own vision of what it could, should, be.

As a movie buff, I love watching the older films and being amazed at how much ingenuity they had to create things without the use of CGI. The world of Mars is quite plainly a movie set, and the horizon looks to be a painting - but it works.

What surprised me about the cast itself is how many well-known actors of the 80s were in this film though their parts were quite small - Chris Connelly, Gayle Hunnicut, Bernadette Peters, Roddy McDowell, even Darren McGavin's part wasn't too large..)

The one negative I do have about this movie is the soundtrack - it seems all over the place - we go from early sci-fi to jazz to, what I can only describe as being similar to, 1970 soft core porn flicks.

1177674,5,B0000039BK,"I will get right to the point here:

IF you are a purist and love the book the way it was originally conceived and published by Bradbury then this DVD miniseries will not work for you. The producers/directors took liberties with the original story line to make it more ""adaptable"" for a (Pre-Cable TV) Prime Time viewing audience. Also the Special effects production values and plot development lag in comparison to more contemporary action/sci-fi dramas. Some of the acting, costumes, and scenes are downright silly and lend themselves to ridicule. Stick to the book and you will be much happier.

BUT if you are a 40-something like myself and fondly and even nostalgically remember the mini-series that came out in 1980 then this is worth watching again and perhaps sharing it with your kids. I was in Elementary School when this was first aired on TV. I had read the book the summer before (an old yellowed battered paperback that was priced 50 cents) and was eager to see it on TV. The primary value of the Mini-Series to many of us Generation X Bradbury fans is probably just wanting to revisit a small part of our childhood.

I see the price now listed as 30-90 dollars for some copies of the DVD set. I do not if it is out of print now or what but that is TOO much to pay. You can watch it for free on You Tube.

As time as gone by it does show it's age, but only a little. The one thing I hated was the use of the obvious miniatures, in several scenes it made the movie kind of corny. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this to any sci-fi fan, even though it's from 1980 you will still like it. I think the reason why I liked it was the story, this is far from being a George Lucas film, but it is still good. The effects could have been better, but it's all about the purse strings.

WARNING!!! SPOILER ALERT - I describe some of the story lines in this film.

Being so excited by watching this three hour mini-series again (for the 10th time) I automatically reached for my pocket sized ""The Observer Book of Astronomy"" circa 1962, revised 1967, by the late great Patrick Moore (did he and Bradbury ever meet?)to read this astounding passage on Mars pages 189-190:

""It is highly probable (the dark patches) are due to vegetation of some sort...not likely to be advanced...it must be remembered, too, that the Martian deserts are decidedly chilly by our standards. (There) might be true canals dug by intelligent Martians to convey water from snowy poles to the arid regions of the equator. This idea was strongly supported by Percival Lowell, an American observer who paid great attention to Mars between 1894 and his death in 1916. Few modern authorities have any belief in man made canals on Mars. (But) the planet cannot be regarded as overwhelmingly hostile, and the existence of vegetation can hardly be denied, though there is as yet no positive proof.""

#HASH TAG UPDATE# Yesterday the Mars Rover on its daily trundles - yes it is still sniffing, scratching and scooping access the latest online - has just detected traces of methane...ehmmm.

Published just two years before the Apollo Moon landings of 1969! What a great preface! The film makes Bradbury's point early on, that what you find or ""discover"" depends upon where you land and what you can observe.

I have this idea that everybody has a spaceship inside them heading for Mars. It only takes a few basic facts to put it there - Mars is a red planet; you can see it in the sky with the naked eye; it is humanly possible to get there with superhuman effort; after the Moon it is the next frontier for Mankind; another chance reach out and test ourselves and put aside all the current petty troubles; it may have once supported life; we already have tangible knowledge of it; we are committed to go - these plus the over lapping stories, ideas and myths and legends. Even the titles of Star Trek has the SS Enterprise circling a red planet suspiciously like Mars. So we come, nurtured from birth as it were, half prepared to enjoy this dramatisation of Bradbury's sublime Martian tales.

The rave reviews speak for themselves. What completes our enjoyment is the quality of the production itself. Most reviewers recognise that a galaxy of fine actors - obviously enjoying their roles - offering fine characterisations which bring to life the author's amazing ability to drill down into human nature. In a series of interlinked all too credible situations we are shown the essential truth: wherever we go we have to take ourselves and our baggage with us - our ideology and theology, our petty weaknesses too, carelessness, competitiveness, greed and vanity as well as our essential practicality and adaptability and dreams.

It makes for a thrilling adventure and involving drama because Bradbury is a cut above virtually every other writer in this field. He knows how to write, to turn out memorable poetic phrases and uncover and develop interesting even strange ideas, he carries the reader with him to the last page as only a great novelist can and his works have real literary value. His later short stories carry just as much weight as this early writing being thoroughly grounded in the human condition: be it space or the Red Planet, or the streets of Paris at night.

Genius that he was, nothing can disguise a certain disenchantment caused by financial loss, when he aired his dislike of the production at a later stage. Bradbury, a struggling writer in the 1930s pulp fiction trade, sold the stories for a miserable $50, to pay the bills. He rued that day from then on - none of the royalties went to him above a minor consultancy and promotional fee. Hence the gripes.

As a string of loosely related high impact Martian stories originally produced for weekly publication, there were problems developing a successful screenplay. The experienced Richard Matheson achieved a good outcome I think creating a logical story for film which seems to mirror the book. Apparently Bradbury actually worked with Matheson - some of the scenes being completely re-written by him. Certainly there is a touch of authenticity over the whole project which would have been drowned out in a modern remake with digital effects and fast action editing coupled with an ear bashing soundtrack. That certainly would NOT have been true to the spirit of the original.

One thing I always liked about this adaptation is its strong narrative emphasis, in order to emphasize the ""chronicles"" nature of the story, where at crucial times the viewer is given a macro view through an impressively warm voiced narrator whose tone is at variance with the clinical disinterested content of his summing up. For example, at the burial scene of the Second Expedition on the edge of an illusory Mid-West town (the sort Bradbury himself was happily raised) capped by a breath taking transitional scene where the greenery and trees melt away to reveal the reality of a windy, stony cold, pink Martian desert. Indeed some of the special effects work superbly - much better than on any other film I can think off. But that is not where the money or where the interest lay in this project.

Or the clinical description of the familiar ant farm activities of human construction on Mars, where a homesteading Western Frontier ethos is clearly referenced:

""The rockets came like drums, beating in the night. The rockets came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke. And from the rockets ran men with hammers in their hands to beat the strange world into a shape that was familiar to the eye. In six months a dozen small towns had been laid down on the naked planet, filled with sizzling neon tubes and yellow electric bulbs. In all some ninety thousand people came to Mars, and more, on Earth, were packing their grips...""

But this film has a literary heart - it is not an over hyped over blown block buster with literary references tacked on off a roll of handy quotations. (Ref, Interstellar and the tacky use of Dylan Thomas's poetry) Has any modern space film examined or argued the issues, beyond a purely superficial level, surrounding Manifest Destiny in space as clearly as here in this wonderful thinking man's epic?

The eventual budget of $8 million (a small fortune for a TV mini series) compares well with the $13 million for Robocop filmed in the same year of 1987. A great deal was spent on the acting talent - with good reason - Bradbury's Chronicles throw up a raft of interesting characters.

The lynch pin of course was Rock Hudson who virtually held the whole thing together helping himself to the lion's share of the salaries at 15% of budget. Here in '87 Hudson is in his prime. There isn't a trace of the later devastating illnesses (a quintuple bypass in 1982 followed soon by AIDs) and his profile is totally in tune with the rugged handsome character he portrays. Beyond his physical appearance on screen, there is the gravitas of early middle age which Hudson deploys at certain points to good effect: the commander; the family man; the brother; the concerned neighbour; the insightful medium - a man who fully understands the potential and legacy of the new planet. Another aspect of his great acting in this film - which may amount to his last really good role - is the sense of vulnerability and an inner confusion which reminded me of his early impressive role in ""Seconds"", John Frankenheimer's 1960s film noir creepy shocker.

This is a top drawer cast:
Darren McGavin - a whole bundle of fun (somewhat random, scatty, memories of Night Stalker?) and touching too, when his get rich quick schemes bottom out, - look how he crumples, minus toupee, later on in the film! An excellent Queen of Broadway Joyce Van Patten supports with good humour.

Roddy McDowell: mad monk on a quest infused with religious fervour slowly wearing down his long suffering brother, Fritz Weaver.

Christopher Connelly and Bernadette Peters perform a hilarious comic turn as the last red blooded ardent male and an entirely self-centered last woman left on Mars (BBC feminists shut your eyes!) its sheer theatricality almost made for her.

A stellar cast of English actors and actresses comprise the Martian contingent (why?) perhaps allowed in due to the half million stumped up by the BBC for UK screen rights: the always arresting Jon Finch (if you think he is anguished here as Jesus Christ via a telepathic Martian on the run, catch his Macbeth for Polanski, the best portrayal on film?) Terence Longdon, Maggie Wright, James Faulkner and Nyree Dawn Porter as a disturbingly life-like robot who displays no emotion, nothing behind dead eyes, when ""her"" husband played by the Canadian actor Barry Morse - familiar from the British TV series Space 1999 a similar veined non-convivial space adventure - succumbs to a heart attack mid scene.* The type portrayed here is the isolated eccentric expatriate. Gayle Hunnicutt in the unrewarding role of Wilder's wife, Bernie Casey as a Martian freedom fighter and Michael Anderson Junior (the director's son who appeared also in Anderson's futuristic ""Logan's Run"" and small parts in TV series such as Hawaii 5 ""O"")as an ""adopted"" Martian complete the brilliant line up.

The last couple that has a story to themselves playing one of the ""types"" set down on the new planet involves East European settlers played by highly experienced German actors Maria Schell and Wolfgang Reichmann. Interestingly here the subject is actually an inversion of the whole story. They are retracing the past to hang on to the lost memory of a dead son.

So the full story of colonisation is not that of expansion. A lot of it has to do with a reactionary impulse to recreate, on an elaborate scale, the past in a new setting. In fact the dissolution of what could have become a carbon copy ex-pat colony with all its limitations becomes the theme of the closing chapter in these Chronicles. To move on we sometimes have to destroy the past - I wish the backward looking mind set of the heritage precious public in the UK would understand that. Of course, as an American through and through, Bradbury is entirely comfortable with the concept of change and welcoming the ""new"" and ""renewal"" explaining it (as a recipe for life) powerfully in his books.

A word about the music and soundtrack which contributes enormously to the overall feel and quite critically in those final scenes which beckon a new future for the Wilder/Hudson family on Martian home. Stanley Myers was already famous his celebrated score for The Deer Hunter (Yes..it was Myers NOT John Williams - who merely played it - who composed the Cavatina!) and for Martian Chronicles he attempted to incorporate the familiar sounds and electronic buzz of the genre with catchy tunes and panpipes and flutes to evoke a lost alien culture (the sounds of Peru were highly popular in the easy listening market at the time - who didn't buy a panpipes album then?) producing a film score of remarkable range and variety which lends precise support to each scene and character. Anderson said: ""In the two films he scored for me.. .he brought my work to a higher level and added a sensitive and emotional quality that was part of his gifted talent""

The score is now held as part of the Stanley Myers legacy in the archives of the RCM London. Thankfully, a CD of the full soundtrack and music is available in stunning sound quality with a beautifully produced booklet crammed with info, some of which I have used here, on the production as a whole. It is the next logical step if you already are or become a fan of the film: Airstrip One AOD 003, but limited to 3000 copies, you may find a copy on Ebay.

If you come to this film without prior knowledge of the book itself, AND WITHOUT WANTING TO DO A MIND JOB ON IT, take heart - this is delightful entertainment with fine performances and story lines. See past some of the tacky animatronic type special effects and dubious costumes and sets - which actually I find great fun -

1177713,4,B0000039BK,"I gave this 4 stars because it's not the finest sci-fi ever, but it was an earnest and well-done production.  Moreover, it was a large production, with sci-fi treatments of prejudice, greed, avarice, ambition, and all the human frailties that would accompany Mankind from earth to Mars or anywhere.
The plotlines roughly followed Ray Bradbury ideas, adapted for the realities of screen production.  Thus, there was an episode where the initial astronauts were shocked in finding an earthlike colony already there.  Later, they learn they'd been fooled and they were by no means welcomed.  Another entry had the native Martians using a weapon beyond our comprehension to destroy yet another earth survey party.  All of this was to no avail and like the American West, the natives of Mars are overwhelmed and become more ghostly than real...just memories.  What transpires in the brief series were vignettes about colonists and their greed, dissension, struggle to succeed, etc.  Some episodes were great, some merely dreary.
Rock Hudson was great in this role as the overall leader of the colonization effort.  A slew of other stars appeared in single episodes, each one of them with self-contained themes of either Martian history or Human current conflict.  The overall result was a good, if not perfect, drama, making Mars seem like a real place.

In 1999, in the face of nuclear war, three flights to Mars take place. The leader of the Earth expedition believes that Mars was destroyed by Earthen diseases but there are some survivors. Strange and unexplainable events start occurring. Earth then engages in World War 3 in a nuclear holocaust. The Colonel who leads the Earth expedition to Mars finds a city on Mars where he discovers a secret that will alter the course of Earth/human history FOREVER.

1177755,5,B0000039BK,"This is so cool; I'm so glad I bought it. If you read the book it makes it all the better. This comes in the three ...chapters? It's like three movies, like BBC's Sherlock. So the first part is the pre-Mars, next is living on Mars and last is after Earth 'blows up'. So they don't cover every story from the book but the ones they do, they do well and completely. It is uneven being that the second part is over half of the book I think while the other two are the very beginning and the very end (if that even makes sense).

Now I watched this a while ago but from memory this are the stories they did: Ylla (First expedition), The Third Expedition, And the Moon Be Still As Bright (the fourth expedition), Night Meeting, The Martian, The Off Season, The Silent Towns, The Long Years, and The Million Year Picnic. And I believe the one story I didn't recognize is The Fire Balloons, from the newer version (I read the old one with Way in the Middle of the Air).

This is pretty well done, they do though add in much more from Rock Hudson's character, Captain Wilder (4th Expedition) to tie everything in together. And Bernadette Peters plays Genevieve, so she isn't horribly ugly as the book paints her to be. But pretty solid stuff here.

1177762,4,B0000039BK,"The three-part miniseries of Ray Bradbury's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES (TV-USA/UK-1979) just may be Richard Matheson's most ambitious screenplay.

Admittedly, this work is hampered by a small budget, meaning chintzy special effects (like toy model spacecraft flying on wires, cardboard ""stone"" edifices, etc.), also a goshawful Disco music track that on occasion heavily chains the show to that long ago dance-crazy era.

One plus is a strong cast that includes Rock Hudson, Roddy McDowall, Darren McGavin, Joyce Van Patten, Bernadette Peters, Maria Schell, Barry Morse and Fritz Weaver. Another is Bradbury's imaginative story, enough of which remains so that fans of the book will recognize an old favorite. Like the sci-fi movies of the 1950s where viewers by necessity mentally enhanced inept visuals, we are invited to use our imaginations to picture the glorious ancient civilization now nearly eradicated simply by man's making contact and infecting the populace with chicken pox, a disease unheard of on the Red Planet. (Shades of HG Wells here.)

Exotically irregular and arid Martian landscapes, littered with inert volcanoes, are actually Lanzarote, Canary Islands (Spain). London and Malta also provided set facilities.

One cloud over this program, now obscured a bit by the passage of decades, is author's Bradbury's objection to the finished product, which was originally scheduled to inaugurate the 1979 NBC TV season. At one press briefing where Ray was the only interviewee, he was asked his opinion of the miniseries. Ray's reply: ""Booooooooring!"" This was enough to bury its broadcast debut until the Chronicles were quietly slipped on the air in January.

No matter. Despite intentional elisions, telescoping and a made-on-the-cheap patina, THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES remains one of the finest sci-fi specials ever to be seen on national television. It's an honest effort that stands up fairly well, and I for one endorse it!

1177773,4,B0000039BK,"How do you film an essentially unfilmable book? Unfilmable both for being a collection of linked jewel-like short stories, and for depending so much upon the lyrical prose of author Ray Bradbury, with the tone conveying so much more than any concrete image could. Add to that the small budget, an uneven cast, and a modern audience so jaded by CGI special effects that they can't see past the old-fashioned effects to the still-beating heart of this story.

Yes, this is a flawed adaptation; and yes, most modern viewers will undoubtedly reject it out of hand simply for the look of it. That said, I still count this as an admirable attempt to capture the poetry of the original on film ... an attempt that sometimes succeeds wonderfully, even if it fails at other times. Rock Hudson has been lambasted for being wooden, but I think his solid, quiet performance fits the character -- and at a couple of crucial moments, he does evoke that magical sense of wonder when most needed. I give him full credit for even attempting a role like this in the first place, so different from most of his film & TV work. (But as a previous reviewer noted, see his stunning performance in ""Seconds"" before you write him off -- his anguish & pain are palpable in that film.)

I'll admit to a certain amount of nostalgia, both for the stories first read in childhood & for the series when it first aired. So that certainly accounts for a good deal of my basic fondness for this imperfect mini-series. But given the fact that ""Star Wars"" had been out for 2 years already & onscreen science-fiction was being redefined as action & special effects, I admire the miniseries all the more for striving to capture the poetry & allegorical qualities of Bradbury's work. His Martians are really idealized human beings at their best, invaded & overthrown by human beings at their consuming, literal-minded worst. He was writing about the conflict between imagination & an extremely crass ""realism"" that worships power, commerce & wealth over beauty & art. Which means that this story is even more relevant today, no matter how wrong the science.

It's best to step back & take the miniseries on its own terms, rather than trying to force it into a contemporary mold that was never capable of containing it. You'll probably wince at some things -- I do myself -- but if you give it a chance, you just might find yourself realizing & appreciating that it's a story that's actually about something, rather than being mere adrenaline-fueled escapism. While it may be clumsy at times, there are real ideas here, real food for thought. And on that basis, caveats noted, I do recommend it.",1367280000,9,2655,4.705376344086021

It's unique, and in my opinion this is why it is celebrated.  Poetry demands its' own techical accuracy. You have to know how to write poetry to be accepted among poets.  To be accepted among poetry readers, you must combine such knowledge with what-you-feel deep within yourself.  The TV series, ""The Martian Chronicles"" with Rock Hudson, combines both aspects wonderfully.  Is it technically accurate among scientists?  Nope.  You have to go to ""2001-a Space Odyssey"" for that praise.  But the TV mini-series does bring enough science to make its' poetry work.  The scenes on Mars!!!  Beautiful!  The encounter of Rock Hudson with the Martian at the end speaking of the meaning of life -- well done!  The music is perfect for refecting the deeper meaning of the various stories.  This older adaptation of ""The Martian Chronicles"" as a TV series is great even now, and can be enjoyed and shown to a class of students -- if it is explained first.  It is not Science 101.

1177795,3,B0000039BK,"I usually don't like to ""pan"" anything - and I'm going to do my best not to here.  The script, written by Richard Matheson, (Star Trek TOS, Somewhere in Time), is at times biblical in it's approach - adding an intellectual quality which complements Ray Bradbury's extraordinary sci-fi classic! Good performances by Roddy McDowall, Rock Hudson, and Fritz Weaver also add to the sci-fi drama.  I was also impressed by some of the planet effects - the Martian landscape scenes look very similar (without the canals of course) to images sent back to earth by Mars Rovers.

Unfortunately, the film is also very dated, as the cast still dons 70s style hair and clothing, accompanied by disco music and 70s style guitar sounds. As mentioned in other comments, stiff acting becomes an annoyance (no thanks to Darren McGavin (What were they thinking when they casted him?)), Bernadette Peters (never a favorite - apologies for the bias) and Nicholas Hammond.  I'll agree that Rock Hudson was stiff in some scenes, but very effective in other scenes! To make viewing the DVD or VHS more beneficial, I would suggest fast-forwarding through all of Bernadette Peters' scenes and Darren McGavins' ""desert bar"" scenes.  Both are very ""hokey"" if you may.

The reason why I bothered to post a review here, is because some portions of the series were very outstanding and a worthy representation of the original Novel (a collection of short stories addressing the same overall storyline).  I really hope that another Director/Producer somewhere revisits this Bradbury Classic and recreates a complete epic of a film that the original novel deserves! Sci-fi magic can still create the story despite scientific findings (e. g. the Martians have created an illusion of an airless planet, disrupting rover sensors, etc.)",1304208000,,1798,5.074576271186441

1177797,4,B0000039BK,"I actually saw this mini series when it first came out in 1980, and upon re-watching it last week I was surprised by just how much of it I could remember (and, honestly, how much of it had an impact on me).

As other reviewers have pointed out, these stories move at much different pace than most sci-fi movies/tv.  The special effects and the music hasn't aged all that well, but I don't really think they are a huge detriment.

I think that the pacing is deliberate because these are fairly cereberal stories, and the special effects are balanced out by the settings.  Mars is a very bleak place, with no real trees, and no particular animal life.  The pre-fab buildings of the settlers look right, as well as the way some settlers want the interiors of their buildings to look modern, and some want them to look more like an old Earth home.

The quality of the individual vignettes vary, the strongest ones more than make up for the weaker ones.  The third expedition is probably the strongest of them, and it sets the stage for most of the rest of the overall plot.

One of the things that jumped out at me was that Wilder spends most of his life on Mars wondering if Spender really was Spender.  And Rock Hudson does a great job in this as a man who is trying to keep the colony going, and hoping to find Martians, and wanting to know just exactly what happened with Spender, and bearing up under the horrible events he's witnessed (the total destruction of Earth, the decimation of the Martians).

Parkhill is a great character-- I know a guy just like him.  The kind of guy who you'd really want on your side in a firefight, but also the kind of guy who, with a planet full of gold and uranium and other precious metals, whose best plan to get rich is by opening a restuarant.  His goofy, over-enthusiastic behavior makes his realization about what happens on Earth that much more powerful.

It is perhaps the unanswered questions that are the best.  Why do a race of telepaths wear masks?  To hide their intention, or to broadcast them?  Why do the Martians give Parkhill half the planet... who was to get the other half.  And why Parkhill and not someone like Wilder?  And was Spender really Spender the whole time?",1297641600,2,2224,4.462871287128713
1177798,4,B0000039BK,"When I first watched this movie some 20 + years ago, I turned it off. The science in the movie was just that bad. In the 1940's when the book was originally written, it was passable, now it is nearly cult classic folly. When you add to it the slow moving drama and mediocre acting from a 1970's has been cast, it is a turn off.

However, much of science fiction is moralistic, making a statement about human society in a way that shelters the author from criticism. In that regard, this movie was good science fiction. There are several major theme points. These are brought out by the opening flashback scenes shown at the beginning of each episode. The theme is that people are selfish. They ""see nothing but their own dreams."" They can't respect other people's point of view. This is shown in the colonization of America, er ah Mars, and in politics both domestic and on the world stage until we bring ourselves to ruin. A Martian eventually dies as everybody wants him to be a different person.

At one point two monks are talking when one says, ""Can't you see the human in the inhuman?"" A theme reference to the human aspect of inhumanity. Other memorable lines are ""I finally get to meet a Martian and I shot him."" And when the Martian gives Rock Hudson the secret of living, ""Anyone with eyes can see the way to live.""

By the third episode, Earth and Mars are nearly completely dead. A man named Benjamin is alone and manages to meet Bernadette Peters, perhaps the last woman in existence. In a dark comedy moment, Bernadette is more concerned about how she looks, even though there is no one to look at her, than say the destruction of civilization. She didn't go back to Earth because they wouldn't let her take all of her clothes. At this point in the film I felt the producers missed the opportunity of doing a complete re-write of the script, turning it into a classic dark comedy. However for the sake of purity to the book they didn't do that. In that regard, the movie also contained occasional needless narration.

After Benjamin decides he would rather live alone than with Bernadette Peters, the movie digresses into hokey when the subliminal message of the movie becomes too overt.  I think a Coen Brothers remake with George Clooney in the Rock Hudson role would be fantastic.",1295049600,3,2297,4.565533980582524
1177799,4,B0000039BK,"I saw this when it was first broadcast and then forgot it.  At Christmas of 1994 I was visiting my brother and his wife in Alaska and she was reviewing a VHS copy for her job (she worked a video distribution company and TMC had apparently just been released on tape).  I watched it with her and the combination of a wonderful Christmas setting (4 feet of snow!) and a warm house full of holiday cooking smells was in marked contrast to the desert planet setting of the story. Despite the poor special effects (you could see the lines lowering the model rocketships ""descending"" to the Martian surface!), I enjoyed the moody setting and the actors, for the most part, did the best they could with the script. Also it looked like there were filters on the cameras to darken the appearance of the Martian atmosphere a bit which helped ""suspend my disbelief.""  Even though it did drag in spots, when it was finally released on DVD I had enough nostalgia left over from the '94 viewing that I eagerly snatched it up.  I liked the score too.  4 stars may be a bit much but I'm a forgiving critic.

The Ray Bradbury Theater TV series was mostly pretty bad stuff, and the horrible film adaptation of A Sound of Thunder a few years ago was pulled from many theaters in less than a week!
In fact the only truly good adaptation that comes to mind was when ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" did ""And So Died Riabouchinska"" starring Claude Rains.
So when it comes to ""The Martian Chronicles"" it's no different. Certain things worked, and I didn't mind weaving Rock Hudson and Roddy MacDowell in and out of the various stories for television continuity. And of course not all the stories made it in. Some of what did came out excellent, such as Bernadette Peters as Genevieve Selsor, and the Million Year Picnic segment. But some of it was particularly bad. I couldn't stand the treatment of Yll and Ylla.
The ""score"" consisting of cheesy disco music and weird synth sounds was actually kinda fun, in that campy so-bad-it's-good kinda way.

The special effects in this piece are nothing much, but it is fine for all that.  Rock Hudson probably was not the best choice for Colonel Wilder, but he does not do badly.

You simply feel like the sets potrayed could have been the remains of a past civilization.

Despite the book being rather short, the screen play writers felt they had some better ideas to offer, which doesn't really hold true.

Aside form the technical aspects of the story and the cheep effects of the film the real purpose of the movie is the message. I will not repeat the message here, as this is why you need to watch the series.

I found the ending satisfying but wondering if there should not be more.

Ray Bradbury is not as thrilled with the mini-series, calling it booooring.  Nevertheless, you have to expect a few adaptations if you are going to have a relevant mini-series.

This may seem like a vehicle for out of work actors. Yet I can assure you that each actor plaid his/her part well enough that you are looking at the character not the actor.

Be aware that the version I watched was complete but the first two parts were on side A and B of the same DVD. Part 3 was on a separate DVD. The good thing was there were no coming attractions to work around with some fancy button pushing. The only thing missing was a voice over commentary that we have come to expect.

Actor Rock Hudson portrays Colonel Wilder, a character created for the mini-series, which clocks in at nearly five hours for the three episodes. The cast includes Darren McGavin, Bernadette Peters, Bernie Casey, Roddy McDowell and Fritz Weaver.

The first episode concerns the three expeditions to Mars and Wilder's life-and-death decision. The colonization of the planet and its ramifications for the Martians is the story line for the second episode. The final episode juxtaposes post-World War III on Earth and life on Mars for the few humans who remain in scattered ""families.""

Directed by Michael Anderson, it may not be as bad as Bradbury vocally stated, but the overuse of the suspension of disbelief due to a lack of proper sets is a major distraction.",1233878400,2,1055,5.267857142857143
1177820,1,B0000039BK,"It's hard to believe that any producer would want to put his name to this. To take a classic SF collection of interwoven stories, hire a great writer (Matheson) to put it together into a mini-series, then use such clunky special effects is beyond belief. Remember--this was made years after the original Star Trek and four years after Star Wars, yet the space ships in flight look like the worst mid-1950's sci-fi movies. Smoke from the rockets in the middle of space? Check out the sand ships as they ""crash."" Even Star Trek, with its limited budget, pulled off far better special effects.

In contrast to this, the Martian sets are artfully done. That's about the only redeeming quality as far as production values.

As to the script--it manages to weave together some of Bradbury's stories using a central character (WIlder/Hudson) and does save Bradbury's major themes. The acting comes across as average, not so much from lack of talent but from poor editing and directing. We know a scene is supposed to be suspenseful, not from quick cuts and rapid pace but only from the eerie music.

If this had been made in the early 60s, the result would be acceptable for its time. However, to be made in 1980 when viewers (and directors) certainly knew better--is a travesty. It's a shame if someone saw this before reading Bradbury.

A lot of love and care had gone into it, and the scenes particularly featuring the Martians, and their architecture were really well done. From the senseless slaughter of York in the first expedition, through the subsequent visits. Ok, some elements had been altered and changed to fit the format of the series, but the overall essence of the book was not lost in the slightest. How many times can you say that a much loved book has been bought to the big or small screen with so much authenticity? I particularly like the bit featuring Spender and his battle with Rock Hudsons expedition members, who have desecrated the dying planet.

Roddy McDowell also puts in a lovely came as a priest seeking to integrate the Martians into The Church. Its wonderfully acted and sensitively realised.

Wilder character played by Rock Hudson. Its main focus is on the tragic consequences, to both humans and Martians, when two civilizations collide after man's attempted colonization of Mars. The Martians, when they appear, lend an air of mystery and eeriness to the saga, since one never is sure when they will appear next, what their intentions are, or even whether they are real or ghosts. Perhaps my favorite scene is where an eccentric restaurant owner named ""Sam Parkhill"" is so spooked by one that comes to visit him, that he shoots the visitor, then tries to get away in a relic Martian ""sand ship"" when he thinks the others are out to get him.

Having shared the memory of the program with my daughter and her friends but unable to find it in any video store led me to Amazon for an order.

The Chronicles is less of a story than it's a series of short stories following life on Mars during the initial manned exploration and the colonization projected for the mid 1990's through 2007, shortly after mankind blew Earth away.  Although they're inter-related by the colonization theme, several of the stories can stand alone so you can skip and jump a little.

The series requires a little suspension of belief to get passed the ideas that you can walk in regular clothing & breathe okay with just a little effort on Mars. BUT once you're past that it's still a pretty good collection of tales. The author shines through with shades of Star Trek in the ironic side stories of the stranded astronomer and with Bernadette Peter's episode. In both, the endings are pure Bradbury.

The concluding scene still has the impact of the original too, but it does seem like it takes a little longer to get there. Production standards and timing has changed a good deal since the 70s, so hitting the 1x fast forward button during the panoramic scenes doesn't hurt at all. It even helps the musical (wind-flute?) backdrop a little.

All in all, it's worth the effort both to see a classic author and a classic of sci-fi. Maybe they'll re-do it as the Europa Chronicles in the near future!",1219363200,,1590,4.644128113879003

The Martian Chronicles is actually a compendium of articles published as stand-alone short stories in the late 1940's.  They are tied together by interstitial pieces added later to draw the individual 'chronicles' into a coherent story.  Each story represents a criticism of American values as they existed during the cold war.  It is a social commentary.  If you are looking for ray guns and space battles, go watch some T.V.  If you read the Martian Chronicles and recognized it for what it is, i.e. a social critique with some kitsch thrown in for fun, then you will enjoy this movie.

1177840,5,B0000039BK,"As a big fan of science fiction for 30 years and a writer of it for over 20 now, I have come to realize that there is a formula for good science fiction and Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles definitely follows that formula and does an excellent job with it. I read the Martian Chronicles while I was attending high school in the mid-1970s and when it was turned into a miniseries in the early 80s, I managed to catch most of it on tv, but I missed it one night and never got to see the whole series in complete until now, on Dvd. Bradbury follows the formula for good sci-fi quite well and the tv series does a fairly good job with it. I have to say that, in most cases I am disappointed with the tv or cinematic reproduction of my favorite science fiction novels, but Martian Chronicles is one of those rare exceptions.

  No doubt most young people raised during the 80s and 90s on all that fast-paced action and digital special effects probably would consider the Martian Chronicles too slow-paced and a bit too boring for their taste-buds. But I for one don't give a damn about action and special effects, as long as it isn't done so poorly that it makes it all look fake, like those retro low-budget thrillers from the 50s. The Martian Chronicles has its share of action and special effects, and it is done well enough to look believable, but at the same time it isn't over-done either, and as far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing.

  For the Martian Chronicles, in following the formula for good sci-fi, is not reliant upon sensationalistic action and special effects, but on an excellent story-line, plot, setting, and characters. All of these aspects are done so well that the Martian Chronicles miniseries comes across as an exceptional adaption of Bradbury's novel, despite the somewhat low-tech special effects. Some fans might be a little disappointed by the fact that there is no time given to any internal perspective of the space voyages aboard the rocketships and very little given to it after the ships land, but there are some good shots of the ships landing and after they have landed, and beautiful shots of the settings on the Martian planet, including the Martian homes (built like extensions upon caves in the sides of mountains), the Martian architectural shrine, which is a fascinating site to see, and the vast desert landscapes and mountains.

  The stories within the miniseries are all very interesting variations on science fiction, including the tragic first contact scenerios, one which puts 3 human astronauts within a grand illusion created by the Martians to fool them into thinking Mars is some kind of heaven, populated by friends and relatives they lost; another in which two parents, the Lustigs, that lost their son David (Michael Anderson Jr) on the second mission, miss him so badly that he comes to them one night, and after they accept him, he gets lost in the town, amidst the crowd, and they discover he's some kind of Martian changling under the mental control of humans who have lost their loved ones.

  Then there's the priest (Fritz Weaver) that has heard some miraculous stories that lead him to believe that Martians still exist, so he and his brother-of-the-cloth companion (Roddy McDowel) go into the desert in search of the Martians and encounter three blue spheres of light, which the priest communicates with and learns about the Martians. There's also a scene where the same priest encounters a visual representation of Christ, as the tortured, suffering soul in human form, and it pleads with him to stop thinking about him because it cannot bear the pain, to turn away and let him go. That was perhaps one of the most symbolic, philosophical aspects of the dreadful human condition in the story.

  Perhaps the only part of the story that bothered me was when the war on Earth became imminent, and the vast majority of the humans on Mars decided to (or were foolishly suckered to) return to Earth. Where was the sense to that? They were perfectly safe and at peace on Mars, with several towns and settlements in their virgin prime. Why suddenly leave those colonies and return to Earth, because a war had started, not because the situation had improved? Excuse me, but isn't that rather like moths flying into flames or horses running into burning barns?

  The only answer to this puzzling action, which was not explained very well, was that the colonies still were dependant upon Earth for resources, and when the war started, the shipments from Earth ended. There was one line between Colonel Wilder (Rock Hudson) and the general at the space center that made this point, but it still seems awfully stupid, and I suppose one could say, a testament to the epitome of human failure, that the entire experiment with Martian colonies should be terminated under those circumstances.

  Despite the war and the termination of shipments to Mars, Wilder returns to Earth to save his brother, and apparently a handful of humans actually decide to stay on Mars (the more intelligent ones, obviously). That would have been my decision. I'm sorry, but I simply find it hard to believe that so many humans at the colonies of Mars decided to return to Earth because of a war. In any case, the story continues by covering what happens to the handful of humans that were smart enough to stay on Mars.

  The most satirically funny piece in the miniseries is about one man (Christopher Connelly) and one woman (Bernadette Peters) that manage to connect by telephone. They are both alone in towns separated by a thousand miles and when the man decides to go through the whole phone book and finally reaches her, he quickly hops onto a small gyro-plane (mini-one-man helicopter, one of the coolest forms of transport in the series) and flies across the vast desert landscape and Martian mountains to her. When he finally reaches her, she is one of the sexiest human females a man could ever hope to have as a companion. But once they get together on a date, alone in a large, high-class restaurant, as he gazes upon her beautiful form (I have to say, Peters really is an amazing piece of eye-candy in this story) he learns she is completely obsessed with her body, a female narcissus-type, and really only wants a man around to serve her and do things for her, including make her meals and fix all the gadgets and mechanical conveniences that she depends upon.

  When she rejects his more physical approach at the door of her home after their date, and admits that she is looking forward to him making breakfast and fixing the hot-tub at the local spa, he decides he's not interested in her anymore and quickly leaves by gyro-plane. I dunno if I would have been so quick to leave such an incredibly beautiful woman like that, in spite of her complete vanity, but then again, I've never even come close to such a beautiful creature in my entire life.  I would have fixed the spa, at the very least, and seen where it went after that.

  The action scene between Sam Parkhill (Darren McGavin),  the owner of a roadside restaurant, and some Martians on sand-ships is perhaps the most memorable action scene of the series. In typical human cowboy-mentality style, McGavin accidentally shoots one of the Martians when it suddenly appears in his restaurant to give him a land-grant for a huge portion of Mars. Later, the Martians run him down and corner him in their sand-ships (ships that look like boats with sails but are designed to move over flat desert- lands, powered by the strong Martian winds). Once cornered, a Martian gives McGavin the land-grant, tells him about the huge portion of land that has been granted to him, and also passes on a cryptic message about Earth.

  It's interesting to note that, of all the original astronauts that were part of the missions to Mars, only one expressed compassion and concern for the Martians and their civilization, while most of the others, in typical human ethnocentric form, were only interested in what they could make of Mars for themselves. The astronaut that expressed concern for the Martians was Spender (Bernie Casey). Once they had reached Mars (the third mission), Spender took a small gyro-plane out to explore the land, and when he reported back, he expressed over-whelming sympathy for the fact that the Martian civilization apparently had perished after making contact with humans, due to a lack of biological immunity to some simple human illness like chicken pox.

  Spender's talks with Colonel Wilder set the mood for much of the series continual mystery about the Martians and their civilization. It's interesting how Bradbury contrasted Spender's genuinely compassionate vision with the complete ignorance and lack of interest shown by the majority of humans. Even Colonel Wilder was slow to pick up on the vision that Spender presented, but he did, while patiently juggling it with his responsibilities to the mission and the human colonies that he helped to construct.

  After they lose Spender, while he does his best to defend the honor of the Martians, cloaked as one of them and pitting Martian weapons against Wilder and Parkhill in a contest at the Martian shrine, Wilder begins to seriously wonder about the Martians and their civilization. Spender gave him the impression that some Martians still survived, and throughout the series, Wilder had a desire to meet one of them. In the end, Wilder does meet a Martian, at the shrine, and we're given a fascinating science fiction and fantasy glimpse upon the speculative nature of the universe and intelligent life, as it is contrasted between a human (Wilder) and a Martian. Wilder learns that they can live and continue humanity on Mars, but only after accepting the fact that it must be different, that some aspects of life on Earth simply wouldn't work there.

  I dunno about anyone else, but despite the fact that the Martian Chronicles was populated by characters from the late 70s and the special effects were still low-tech, I think it still does quite well today, because the story-lines, settings, and characters are all done so well. There's nothing about this miniseries that can be faulted as cheap, low-budget, unrealistic (accept maybe the atmosphere of Mars, still a big mystery), poorly played or badly acted. It's all quite good and any true fan of science fiction that hasn't seen it should see it before reaching any conclusions based upon other people's reviews.",1195344000,13,10461,4.813616071428571

There's a certain amount of action, that is, the required amount of shootings and such - but more, it's a real opportunity to actually visit something  ""different"" -something truly ""alien"" - which does not force our standard solutions on it.

I'd certainly recommend this series to anyone who is willing adventure into the ""unknown"" - it may not be a walk on the wild side - but it is a walk on Martian soil with no promises of respecting human thinking over alien ritual.  Get the popcorn, kick your feet up and let the journey begin.

The ending left me a little unsettled until I actually put myself into the place of the characters involved and asked: ""What would I do?""  That's when the ending changed from confusion to promise.

1177859,3,B0000039BK,"I first saw the ""Martian Chronicles"" miniseries as a child -- before reading Bradbury's book -- and it's made an indelible impression on me.  Many of the special effects don't hold up, and the pacing of some of the scenes is glacial.  I can understand Bradbury's criticism that the miniseries was boring.  But the score is wonderful, and the production design is unforgettable -- the geometric structures of the Martian cities, the frightening masks that the Martians wear, etc.  Despite the lapses in effects and budget, and the obviousness of the location shooting (no red sky, etc.), the miniseries achieves a distinctive look and feel.  There is nothing else like it in sci-fi television.

Some of the sequences simply don't work.  I always fast-forward through the endless scenes of the two priests wandering in the desert looking for glowing spheres; and the ""Genevieve Selsor"" sequence with Bernadette Peters is uninteresting as well.  But the adaptation of ""And the Moon Be Still As Bright,"" with Bernie Casey indelible as Spender, still works.  In a later segment, Wilder's nighttime meeting with a ghostly Martian from the past (or future?) retains an elegiac tone, and provides a pretty good manifesto on how life ought to be lived.  Elsewhere, there's a sand-ship chase sequence that looks cheesy, but those spooky zoom shots of the masked Martians as they pursue Sam Parkhill still unnerve me.  Parkhill's discovery of nuclear war on Earth -- viewed through a telescope -- is a memorable moment, powerfully scored.  And the ""second expedition"" sequence, with the astronauts somehow finding themselves in Green Bluff, Illinois, rather than on Mars, reaches a climax that is still downright frightening.

It's hard to say how much of the miniseries I am viewing through the lens of nostalgia -- I am, perhaps, being more forgiving than it deserves.  But to those seeking offbeat sci-fi offerings, this is worth a look.",1185062400,39,1929,5.082539682539682

Notwithstanding the author's views - I actually really liked this mini-series.  Maybe it was the direction, the subject matter or the location for the filming, but this show managed to hit a very odd note of alienation and desolation that built upon the events depicted in Bradbury's celebrated novel.  There are moments in this admittedly ""TV movie of the Week"" quality production that are very eerie, evocative and memorable.

1177882,5,B0000039BK,"I just got through watching this movie(series there off) for the umteenth time and love it more each passing viewing of it.  You will think it's cheezy if you just came in from the other room and see a bit of it on your way out, but if you have the attention span of anyone older than three you can fully appriciate it.  The WOW! factor isn't there but it is more interesting in dialogue.  The Gee Whiz factor would be more appropriate here.  Rock Hudson's acting abliity is what made it work, but even Darren McGavin and all the rest were just as good(just less prestige with them).  The characters were likeable and some down right touching, in particular the Wife and daughter(despite being robots) of the retired General of the Zues project(Hathaway)  And of course Friz Weaver is wonderful as the wondering priest on a mission.  Roddy McDowel his side kick as the clunky samwise to Frodo Baggins.  No martain was protrayed by McDowell but your made to think so, as both of the actors who played the males(young and old thier are different ones with dialouge if you haven't noticed) sound like him.  The best part of the movie is the martians and they are not cheezy like the rest of the FX.  Although MY version was a recording from the Sci-fi channel and was mutilated beyond beleif and plot holes were evident in why the ""last martian"" was a ghost and the opening scene he was not.  Spendor Was he or not?  Never revealed.  But Sci-fi sux and this is the full uncut version here on Amazon and I HOPE is the orignally transmitted version with more dailogue detail with Vistal and the androids after the creator(Hathaway) dies as I remember when I was nine/ten or so. There is also a scene(not on sci-fi) with two other androids who come in contact with Vistral and ""The Hathaways"".  I don't remember much more than they were more Bernadette Peters fawning vanaty queens who land in another rocket and challeng, yet again, Vistral's vain character with the beauty of women.  Insidently, Roddenberry's ""Usher II"" is not included but the closest I can determine, ""Captain Black""(Nicholas Hammond) is the one who suffers from that.  In the opening book ""The Expeditions"" The second and third expidetions(Zeus II and III) were interesting and hardly boring to watch,  Spendor Incodent(Zeus III) the best of them. The first called ""Zeus""(expiditon craft to Mars) was pointless and did not open the story very well. ""Commander York"" had no meaning beyond getting killed. his single crewman had no dialogue at all. How he took off(from Earth) in a pod instead of a rocket is beyond me. Otherwise, ""The Expeditions"" was the best part of the movie and gave it a good launch for the other two.

Despite what sum people say, the leisure suits were more belivable than space suits and glitz because it was a breathable atmosphere(in ths tale) as more artistic and less rigid science. and the uniforms weren't that bad, they were practical for survay and explore missions(in atmospheric condiions such as this)..  The music or muzak only reflected the clothes, FX and times(1980) and I thought went well for a retro buff like me.  The only thing that bothered me was the ""bar music"" which was the same ole disco tune in EVERY bar on Mars, how stupid is that?  The insidental muzak was good however(if you like funk) and sometimes haunting. the total I heard was four tunes(and the bar muzak which was not incodental but IN the bars). Meyres got tired of the network execs not paying him I guess.  Also remember this is a low almost NO bugdet film and some poeople are too spoiled to like it( or admit they did back then.) It was the Networkers' fault, not the producers or director. Mathison is masterful.  If you are a Star Wars buff BUT watched sci-fi before it, you'll luv this tri-chronical trilogy series(based on Bradbury's epich multi-book set).

1177883,4,B0000039BK,"Let me start by saying that The Martian Chronicles is probably my favorite Sci-Fi book, and likely in my top 3 overall. So, any movie made in 1979 attempting to capture this brilliance would have a tough road ahead of them in my mind.

This movie stays fairly true to the ideas of the book, although there are some parts that were omitted to keep the story up-to-date; Such as the section that took place in the deep south with the mass exodus of the Black-Americans to Mars. And, the special effects were very cheesy, such as the sand ship scene where there were plastic figurines being used in small plastic boats.

1177884,3,B0000039BK,"I recall when this TV mini-series made its debut in 1979. The Martian Chronicles was met with much fanfare with celebrity interviews with Rock Hudson, the cover of TV Guide, and numerous features in sci-fi magazines like Starlog, Omni, and Future.

Looking back, its easy to mock its TV origins: the polyester, double-knit leisure suits emblazoned with NASA patches the size of dinner plates to look ""reasonably"" authentic, the roll-call of sturdy television B-actors,and relatively cheap SFX models and effects.

Nonetheless, the sense of Bradbury's vision is still retained in the depiction of the martians in the the first hour--graceful, elequent, and understated. The theme of Bradbury's novel depicting the colonization and eventual despoiling of Mars is rendered quite thoughtfully.

Bradbury intended to make the humanoid colonization of Mars analogous to the conquest of North America. If anything stands out in this mini-series it is the production design and most especially the martian sets, make-up and costumes: the landscapes and habitat of the martian's homeland is painstakingly imaginative and stunning.

The acting, save for Rock Hudson, Nicholas Hammond (the first actor to play Spiderman), Bernie Casey, and Darren McGavin, won't win an Emmy, but is passable. As an aside, Hudson was clearly an underestimated and underappreciated actor of a considerable presence and talent for both the big and small screens. Even with this lame screenplay, he somehow raises the bar to this adaptation of one of Bradbury's finest works. In this mini-series he looks remarkably healthy; he had not yet succumbed to the ravages of AIDS that would cut short his life a mere four years later.",1148860800,8,1695,5.337078651685394

1177886,3,B0000039BK,"-- but this rendering, unfortunately, is not. Taken for itself, though, it's fair entertainment.

It appears to collect a made-for-TV series of the 1970s, with Rock Hudson starring in most segments. The setting is a happily fictional Mars, with breathable air, paved roads, and the occasional Martian. The story arc covers a wide range in the very few years represented. Initially, the Martians try to defend their land against the terrestrial invaders - a good move, as it turns out. I won't give any spoilers, but there are some remarkable turns of event. Each turn redefines the meaning of the colony and, in the end, the colonists themselves.

The style, women's hair in particular, is a bit dated. Sets and effects are fair for their time, well above the standard of the original Star Trek, but won't impress a modern viewer. On the whole, this collection is worth a look, but maybe not a close one or a second one.

1177900,4,B0000039BK,"The fact that Richard Matheson did the teleplay for his old buddy Ray Bradbury's novel left something awkward to be said.  The fact that they have been longtime friends should have given Matheson an insight into The Martian Chronicles from knowing the man who had written it.  Not so, apparently.  The subtle changes from Bradbury's novel are there and they're glaring.  Hmmmm.

Let's look at television in 1980.  Still expanding.  Still trying to find its limits and its leverage.  The fact that this was a mini-series that spread over three nights makes it a curious dinosaur in its uncut form at four hours and fifty-three minutes spread over two discs.  The actors are great and dated of the time when it was produced.  Rock Hudson and Bernadette Peters and Roddy MacDowall.....etc.  The special FX are just that....special.  Kinda like they were suggested by a 'special' person with a 'special' vision. (Someone who rode the small bus to school, if you catch my drift).  Episode one drags here and there with the daring space scenes that go on for way too long. (At least in 1980, they seemed daring).

Overall, the essence of Bradbury's vision is still there.  A little maimed and a little convoluted, but still somewhat intact and that is what makes this film a keeper.  I was ten when this movie of the week came out and I remember watching it and being awed, maybe a little bored too.  Now I watch and I giggle at the FX and I glare at Matheson's twistings of the tale and I take it for what it is.  An attempt at bringing Bradbury to life.  And for that I have to say it is watchable.  We get our Bradbury any way we can, small doses or large, over the counter or under the table.

1177917,4,B0000039BK,"Seriously Retro!

I've a soft spot for this one, having watched it the first time around in 1980 (which is when it reached the UK).  No doubt that it's the power of Ray Bradbury's original stories that carries it.

In a sense, you've got to switch off your brain to enjoy this.  Or perhaps I should say you should switch of your Left Brain: the logical, analytical part.  For example, we all know now that people can't breathe on the surface of Mars without space suits.  Let it go!  If you can't do that then don't bother with this DVD.  Switch on your Right Brain (imagination) and you've a chance of enjoying this... just a chance though!

First, let's get the bad stuff out of the way.  The special effects are bad.  I know that they didn't have CGI etc then, but this was 2 years after Star Wars, or in a TV sense, a year after Battlestar Galactica.  I'd have expected a major US network to have at least bettered Dr Who or Blake's 7 standards; but they didn't.

The pace is very slow.  Sometimes that lets the stories unfold at a natural pace, but a lot of the time, you're tapping your fingers, thinking ""get on with it!"".  In this regard, Bradbury was scathing in his comments at the time: ""it's boring, they've made it boring"", he said.  And he had no doubt where the blame lay, saying that Michael Anderson had directed it ""underwater"".  He wasn't wrong.

And often, the acting doesn't help.  Rock Hudson has never been the most exciting actor in the world, and he's particularly dull here.  Sure, he does integrity and trustworthiness just fine, but there were times that I felt his character needed a little more fire in his belly and Hudson doesn't provide it.  The rest of the cast is variable, to put it mildy.  At one end, Bernie Casey is just fine as Spender, and Nicholas Hammond, best remembered as a rather plastic 70s Spiderman, is equally good as the leader of the second expedition.  At the other end, Roddy McDowell is just plain irritating as Father Stone.

Now the good stuff!

The sets are great, and the Martians themselves are wonderfully ""other wordly"", helped by the fact that they are used sparingly.

Plotwise, there's some good changes been made.  I know that people here have referred to Bradbury's work as a ""novel"" but it's not: it's actually a collection of loosely connected short stories.  Screen writer Richard Matheson sensibly drops some of the more unworkable original stories, such as ""Way Up In The Middle Of The Air"" (negroes in the American South climb into a spaceship to escape their white oppressors) and also the original second expedition story, where the earthlings' ""first contact"" is with a Martian lunatic asylum!.

His masterstroke is to  unify the work by beefing up the role of Colonel John Wilder (Hudson) so that he appears in nearly all the stories.  (In Bradbury's book, Wilder appeared in only two of them).  In one story, this change actually manages to improve on the original.  I refer to the story (spoiler ahead!) of the Martian who changes shape, according to the wants and desires of the human person that's nearest to him.  In the mini series, the Martian ends by changing back to his actual form, because he bumps into Wilder (not in this story in Bradbury's book).  Wilder is the only person on Mars that actually wants to meet a real, live Martian.

1177919,4,B0000039BK,"This is the 1980 mini-series based on the Ray Bradbury novel on 2 DVDs and is nearly 300 minutes long.

If you can get past the weak special effects, scientific errors, and obviously incorrect timeline, it is an interesting and captivating story despite all that.

Mars is apparently a lot more hospitable than we were led to believe as astronauts walk about the planet in unprotected leisure suits. Large fluffy clouds, occasional rain storms, and canals (yes...they are back), also defy current science of what Mars is like.

In this story the first manned flight to Mars also takes place in 1999!!! In 2004 we are not even close to this milestone. But it's not a documentary and in 1980 after the Apollo successes, perhaps the Mars flight seemed almost imminent.

Sci-fi films should perhaps avoid hard dates as they really age the production once the time is past.

But Rock Hudson, Darren McGavin, Bernie Casey, Roddy McDowell, Fritz Weaver and others give good performances as humans trying to understand, adapt, and live in a new alien environment.

And most importantly, they try to coexist with the native inhabitants who, of course, rightly regard them as alien invaders.

The video transfer is acceptable and the electronic music score is interesting. No extras at all unless you count scene selection and subtitles.

The ending seems to fizzle somewhat but may appeal to some.

Certainly worth having for science-fiction fans and especially so if you like Ray Bradbury and/or Mars (or Tir as the Martians refer to it).",1095379200,37,1530,4.9453125
1177920,4,B0000039BK,"The first thing to note before viewing this DVD, the special effects are just plain awful... but fortunately are restrained after the first episode.  This is one series that would benefit greatly from some CGI re-rendering a la ""Star Wars"".  I think it could be done easily.

The second thing to note... the script is not entirely the book it's taken from. It cuts and embellishes here and there, but many chapters from the book that are removed are sort of hinted at.  Unfortunately, the movie is long and can drag for some people.

On to the good stuff... the movie really survives beside itself mainly due to the performances.  Bernie Casey is outstanding as Spender... he shows a real love for the dialogue.  Also, Barry Morse (of Space 1999) really makes you feel for his character of Hathaway.  Rock Hudson, is Rock Hudson ('nuf said).

The production design stands up to today, the artistic work on the Martian cities and artifacts benefits the production, especially in the martian home sequence (along with the delectable Maggie Wright).  The makeup effects and costuming are quite good (except for the leisure suits).  The score is elegantly done by Stanley Myers, but at times shows too much emphasis on electronics bordering on disco.

Overall, the series is for fans of the book or 70's sci-fi in general.  I would have liked to have seen a behind-the-scenes featurette and some extras.",1095120000,6,1399,4.852320675105485

Loved the 80s style film music, which is used well and sparingly at that. Best of all are the imaginatively designed sets and the dreamy atmosphere, which are terrific, as are the golden eyed Martians.

There are 3 episodes, the first being the best, simply because this is where the story is at its most interesting and intriguing. Episodes 2 and 3 are more uneven, but mostly enjoyable.

1177923,2,B0000039BK,"Rock Hudson. Futuristic wear that looks like bad leisure suits. These are two of the warning signs that ""The Martian Chronicles"" might not live up to its potential. Although it wasn't intended to be a camp classic full of stilted dialogue, inane acting and plain stupid moments, ""The Martian Chronicles"" is precisely that at times.

British producers Charles Fries and Milton Subtosky (""The House That Dripped Blood"", ""Asylum"") made a solid attempt to adapt Bradbury's novel for the small screen. Working with a strict budget, a limited roster of actors and a poor excuse for an optical effects house prevented this project from achieving everything it could have.

Somehow a talented writer (Richard Matheson) and an average director (Michael Anderson who directed ""Logan's Run"")managed to turn Ray Bradbury's classic novel into a run down bargain basement version of an epic. Bradbury himself complained about how the film made his book ""boring"". Richard Matheson stated that he felt his screenplay was ruined by inept execution. Maybe. That being said, ""The Martian Chronicles"" does have its moments but is seriously flawed. Many people (including this reviewer when he was younger)liked parts of this mini-series. Surprisingly, those few strong moments still have resonance chiefly because of the source material and an occasional performance worth noting that brings the essence of Bradbury's novel to life.

On DVD the mini-series is broken down into its original three part presentation running at just under 5 hours. Perhaps its the leisurely pace or the fact that the program was build around commerical breaks. Either way, there are times that this film is like the Energizer Bunny on downers--it keeps going on and on and on and on....ad nausem. The first two hours has the best material from it.

The performances range from exceptional to exceptionally bad. Rock Hudson plays Col Wilder who sits in a chair that looks like a reject from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and watches as Mission Control puts two ships over two years in harm's way by sending them to a Mars populated by aliens that have telepathy and the ability to project whatever anyone wants to see. The first hour of this epic wobbles along but is still sturdy enough to have power. When the first expedition's astronauts are murdered by a jealous Martian husband, a second is send. When they land it appears they're on Earth twenty years in the past. The commander (Nicholas Hammond in a smart, nicely textured performance) suspects something is rotten on Mars but gets sucked into the illusion when he sees deceased loved ones from his past. This single segment is the most succesful and Anderson's direction gives it added power with his careful use of optical effects to only enhance what is necessary. Matheson's idea of using the character of Wilder to unite the whole series is a great idea--unfortunately Rock Hudson just doesn't deliver. It seems as if his performance was done under the influence of sedatives at times.

The second successful sequence also in the first part involves Col. Wilder and a third crew (Bernie Casey and Darren McGavin among them)who go to Mars to discover the fate of the previous crews. When Casey's character discovers the havoc that humanity has wrecked on the Martian civilization he goes native attempting to kill his crew members. Again, the opticals are sparingly used and the acting carries the day for the most part. Casey gives a solid performance.

The amateurish opticals (this was done in 1980 and they looked like they were done in 1950)done by a special effects studio in the UK undoes some of the more involved sequences set on the Red Planet. For example, there are sequences where you can literally see through the ships. In others, they're photographed so it's very clear they are miniatures. The production design, though, is outstanding and the location photography (it was shot in Malta and on sound stages in England) along with some strong performances from Fritz Weaver, Roddy McDowall, Maria Schell and others allow the awkward episodes to be pretty easily forgotten. My favorite of the latter part of the series involves a story about the return of a son who was killed years before. His mysterious reappearence doesn't spook the family. Instead, they welcome this stranger that looks, talks and acts like their son even though they know it couldn't possible be him.

This two disc DVD has no extras although it does include the teasers for the next episode at the very end of each disc. The full screen presentation looks solid although there's noticeable compression problems (or, perhaps, its related to the film stock that was chosen to shoot the mini-series). Analog blemishes (i.e., hair, dirt, etc.)are few and far between. Although it's not a perfect presentation (the picture lacks sharpness and the detail isn't what it should be), it's better than most shows from the same time frame. If you enjoyed the original series be prepared for a shock. ""The Martian Chronicles"" doesn't hold up all that well twenty-four years later but there are fleeting moments that hint at the missed potential of this ""television event"". Hopefully, someday, someone will actually tackle Bradbury's metaphorical tale the way it should be done. In the meantime, if you long to revisit your television past, one could do a lot worse than ""The Martian Chronicles"".",1092355200,20,5397,5.036954087346024
