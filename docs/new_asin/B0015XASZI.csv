8318224,5,B0015XASZI,You can try this on UTube for five minutes to see if it is for you. It is not a workout in the conventional sense. It is a series of movements that is extremely low impact.,1238889600,3,172,3.8055555555555554
8318225,1,B0015XASZI,"I was extremely excited after reading the reviews and receiving my DVD.  I thought I had found a ""beginning"" workout to ease me back into ""working out"" after spinal fusion surgery.  What a disappointment.  The most difficult part of this so called ""workout"" is opening the dvd container.  It is a ridiculous excuse for exercise and a TOTAL waste of money.  If ANYONE is thinking of buying a copy of this farce, please feel free to email me and i will be more than happy to send you my copy just to get it out of my house.  The creators of this debacle should be ashamed!  absolutely AWFUL!",1235260800,,589,4.398148148148148
8318226,5,B0015XASZI,"After buying the ""Relieving Tension in the Neck and Spine"" DVD, for myself, I was convinced that these workouts really work. My mom works a labor job 10 hours a day where she is constantly picking up heavy products. Her back always hurts when she gets home. She use to always take some medication and went directly to sleep. So I decided to buy her this dvd. Now she thanks me all the time because it works so much better than medication. After the exercise, she actually feels like doing gardening or going out rather than going to bed!",1215388800,2,537,4.434343434343434
8318227,5,B0015XASZI,"I don't write reviews but this stuff really works.  I have worked as a TV Cameraman for 25 years now and my back hurts! I started this program after watching my wife use it. I found relief! Its simple, straight forward and for me a guy who lives life under a lot of physical stress, its an escape from the pain.  Buy it, do it, feel the results.",1213660800,3,345,4.0588235294117645
