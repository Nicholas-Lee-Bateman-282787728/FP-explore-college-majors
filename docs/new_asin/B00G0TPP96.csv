8619998,4,B00G0TPP96,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted a few simple, effective techniques I could rely on for self defense. Despite having studied a variety of martial arts over many years, I currently have a heart condition that prevents me from engaging in the high intensity training required in martial arts and self defense gyms. This DVD fit the bill for me. The techniques are easy to learn because they are natural, uncomplicated moves, simple but powerful. Still, if you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with striking or kicking, you will want to practice most of the moves with either a partner,as in the DVD, or heavy bag, preferably both. Knowing you can perform the self defense technique is crucial if you expect to use it in real life. This DVD is as basic as it gets. Just a small number moves that are tried and true. And Kurt Howland's customer service is excellent.",1393545600,6,866,4.703947368421052
