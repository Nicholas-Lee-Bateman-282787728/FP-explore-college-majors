8746251,5,B019X2WM9C,"I was fortunate to view ""American Heart"" as part of a local documentary series.  The film drew a crowd of 100 people to our small town, and the filmmaker was present for a Q&A.  I felt so privileged to be shown the personal stories of three different immigrants to St. Paul, each with very serious medical challenges.  The film did a remarkable job of capturing the perspectives of each of the three men, and the compassion and caring shown by their medical providers, who attended to their physical, emotional, and cultural needs with great sensitivity.  A gem of a film - highly recommended!",1453507200,,593,4.728155339805825
8746252,5,B019X2WM9C,"American Heart is a poignant documentary that truly touched my American heart. I've watched it four times now, including once with the film's director Chris Newberry present for a post screening discussion. As a college professor who happens to teach a class on Film in Society, I'm ever grateful for having had access to Chris and his gem of a cinematic narrative that offers students (and all audiences) a window into the lives of three refugees, their families and a small, but remarkable group of doctors and health care providers who's own American hearts are worn on their sleeves as they confront the myriad challenges of diagnosing and caring for these otherwise under served and mostly forgotten beautiful souls. American Heart brings out those core emotions that remind us how fortunate most of us really are and how there is hope in this world as long as we endeavor to act as decent, caring, humble and respectful human beings. This is a 'must see' for everyone!",1452038400,,974,4.873493975903615

8746254,5,B019X2WM9C,"American Heart is a wonderful film that tells the stories of four refugees to the US. Their lives are certainly not easy but they, for the most part, persevere. This is a film that may bring tears, but is definitely worth seeing.",1451952000,,229,4.476190476190476
