6244416,5,B00HZVX14O,"I am completely shocked that finally, this classic Elizabeth Montgomery movie is FINALLY receiving a DVD release! I grew up watching this on TV in the 90's, now the only way to watch it is on YouTube in poor quality. I am still shocked this is really getting released...this is just too good to be true!",1391299200,16,303,4.428571428571429
6244417,5,B00HZVX14O,"I saw this on tv. It was excellent and was nominated for about five Emmy awards. Elizabeth Montgomery turned in a stellar performance. This version was well researched and stayed close to the facts, as I've read them in books. It was written well and acted well. It also includes some possibilities of theories of the murders (which I won't tell you and spoil it for you). If you find the Lizzie Borden case to be fascinating, you can't go wrong with this version of events.",1391126400,28,474,4.523255813953488
6244418,5,B00HZVX14O,She was such a wonderful actress and really outdid herself in this Lizzie Borden movie. I like the little spin in the ending. Makes you think about how the murders really happened.,1523750400,,180,4.65625

6244421,5,B00HZVX14O,"This 1975 TV movie dramatizes the 1892 double murder and the 1893 trial of Lizzie Borden. The film is dark and has lots of gauze on the cameras. The acting is impeccable. Elizabeth Montgomery plays Lizzie rather chillingly and gives a strong performance as a woman with one too many screws loose.

Katherine Helmond is pretty good as well as the fearful older sister Emma. These two women are famously known for their sitcom roles, but here you find them convincingly playing serious roles completely different.

Hayden Rourke, Gail Kobe, and Finnoula Flanagan also star. There are no special features. Run time is 136 minutes.",1516579200,2,627,4.961904761904762

6244427,5,B00HZVX14O,"Elizabeth Montgomery (Bewitched), stars as the legendary LIZZIE BORDEN. This made for TV movie from 1975 is perhaps the best one ever made for this tall tale of the actual lady in question. Did she really kill her father in his sleep and her stepmother upstairs?  After watching this movie, I personally have no doubt she did do it. But, at the time this happened in August 1892, a court jury found her not guilty as I believe the prosecution did not prove their case. Remember, there was no DNA testing back then or even looking for blood, etc. in drains.
I believe she killed both of them in the nude as to prevent clothes being stained with their blood and so on. She only needed to go clean herself as she would normally do all the while her live in ""maid"" was cleaning outside. Disposing of the murder weapon was not that hard, either.
The DVD looks and sounds good here. Wish one day this would come out on HD Blu-ray with some special features!
I would love for SCREAM FACTORY to pick this one up and do a nice edition!",1511827200,,1026,4.34375
6244428,5,B00HZVX14O,Probably the best Lizzie Borden movie ever made.  Maybe because it is the first one that I have seen.  Excellent acting and sticking to the real story for the most part.,1510444800,,169,4.419354838709677

I just had to see it again after all these years.  Well it was as great as I remember, and was surprised that she was related to Lizzie Borden.",1508716800,,296,4.016949152542373

6244432,4,B00HZVX14O,"Ok the main reason I'm leaving a review, is for the quality of the DVD. I'm glad to say this is the only version I've purchased via internet, that was not a burned copy of a VHS copy. Twice I purchased this movie from other dealers with legit websites, only to receive a crappy VHS copy that was burned on  to DVD - R disc. Which is supposed to be illegal, I'm not sure how those websites get away with it, but they did.  This is a legit DVD copy of the movie, it still has some specks that pop up on the picture, but the quality blows the previous copies I had (now in the garbage) away. So if you're looking for the best possible looking picture and sound of this film, you got it.",1504137600,,683,4.014705882352941

6244434,3,B00HZVX14O,"This is a pretty good.  Actually better then average t.v. movie.  I watched it when it originally aired.  I think when it first aired it slipped a little bit past the censors.  I watched it again the second time they showed it and it didn't seem the same.  Anyway Elizabeth Montgomery is fantastic as Lizzie.  The movie is a good drama as to what could have happened.  It is better done then some theatrical movies.  In real life she was found not guilty.  And the movie leaves you wondering.  It is done first class all the way,",1502668800,,529,4.360824742268041
6244435,5,B00HZVX14O,"Excellent pacing and story, though not factual. It provides a possible, though unlikely, explanation for how she could have committed the murders.

I remember watching the original tv broadcast and thinking, ""Hey, did i just see what i thought i saw?"" Now i know...i did indeed see what i thought i saw.
Makes you wonder how many other network tv movies of the time (60s-70s) had nudity that got past the censors.
Those very quick scenes were not shown in subsequent network reruns. But they are included on this dvd.

Not that it matters. This made for tv movie is much better in my opinion than the awful movies my wife and i pay to see at our local AMC.",1501459200,,656,4.458333333333333
6244436,5,B00HZVX14O,"""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" is one of the very best of the made of tv movies ever produced. Well written, well directed and produced and very well acted. It made for a most riveting story to view. It certainly helped that most viewers were at least somewhat familiar with the events that took place that one day in 1892 in Massachusetts at the Borden household. And the trial itself of Lizzie Borden would have to be considered the the trial of the century in the 19th century. As for this movie there are two things that really strike me about it.

First is Elizabeth Montgomery's performance which is superb. Up To when this film came out I was only familiar with her work on the sit-com ""Bewitched"". Yes I know she had done serious drama before starring as Samatha but I had never had the chance to see any of her other work before her portrayal of Lizzie. She blew me away with this performance. There was a lot of complexity to the roll that Elizabeth brought to her performance as Lizzie. She was very believable and brought dimension and maybe even some sympathy to the woman who would be accused of murdering her parents. Montgomery went on to have a distinguished career as an actress. But if there is any work of hers that might be considered a highpoint of her acting, a very strong case could be made for ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"".

The second thing about this film that strikes me is how close to accurately the story is to the actual events. I have mentioned in other reviews in the past that I am a bit of history nerd. So I was very much familiar with this notorious crime and Lizzie Borden. The events that take place in the movie are consistent for the very most part with the accrual details that took place. Of course with any movie dealing with historical events dramatic license is a given to the plot to move things along with the story. Still what is shown here in ""Lizzie Borden"" is excellently depicted in detail to what happened. Well over a hundred years later there is still debate as to whether Lizzie did commit the murders or not. Of course anyone who knows about the case remembers she was found innocent at the trial. Was she really innocent or not? Who knows. Only one person could say for sure, Lizzie Borden. And she took the facts of what actually happened to the grave with her.

One of the best features of the movie is the director and the writers don't try to show either way during the production if Lizzie did kill her parents or not. It is left up to the viewer to decide for themselves what they think took place. One of the interesting parts of the film however is where they show how the murder could have been performed. It is in relation to the fact that no blood was found on the clothes Lizzie was wearing when the murders were committed. That certainly played an important factor in the jury finding her not guilty. The movie suggests what may have happened as to why there was no blood on her clothes but without making accusations this is what did happen. As to what that suggestion may be I won't say to prevent having to have a spoiler alert. You just need to watch this yourself and make your own decision. Watch this and see for yourself.",1501113600,2,3203,4.407094594594595

After studying the timelines on the case i've come to the conclusion that it wouldn't be possible. (I won't go into details but it has to do with the amount of blood that would have been in her hair.) While i don't think she did it, i think she knew who did and was an accessory to the crime.

Terrific performances from Katherine Helmond (as Lizzie's sister, Emma) and Fritz Weaver (as Lizzie's stern father). In fact, ALL of the performances are great. But they are surpassed (as they should be) by Elizabeth Montgomery's riveting performance as Lizzie Borden. Intense, nuanced, mesmerizing...if this had been a theatrical release, I'm sure that Ms Montgomery would have received an Oscar nomination at the very least!

She is absolutely mesmerizing in the role of Lizzie Borden and might as well have stepped through the pages of history. The casting director gets a huge plus on this production: I'm not sure I would ever have cast Ms. Montgomery in the role (or even thought she would have accepted it) but the result was pure magic. The story is fascinating, the conjectures probably right on and the supporting cast, including a favorite of mine, Fritz Weaver as Lizzie's father, beyond compare. I have to confess, of all the images I took away from this, the one that stands out most clearly is the scene at the table when the father demands they eat maggot-ridden food.

6244482,5,B00HZVX14O,"Living within driving distance from Fall River, MA, I'm well aware of the story behind Lizzie Borden. I thought this movie was probably the most accurate account of what Lizzie probably went through when the case finally went to the court. The movie played flashback scenes during the trial phase to offer an explanation of the reasons why Lizzie murdered her father and stepmother.  I was surprised by the fact that Elizabeth Montgomery played the role of Lizzie Borden as accurate as all of the newspapers of the time portrayed her to be.  I only knew Elizabeth Montgomery from the old TV show, ""Bewitched,"" but I found her to be an excellent actress in this role.

In the historical outcome of the actual trial, Lizzie Borden was found not guilty by the jury. However, what the movie neglects to tell you is how the rest of the townspeople--or rather the upper class citizens of whom Lizzie wanted to live like--had already ""convicted"" her as a murderess and ostracized her.  The movie doesn't show this.  All in all, I found it to be a good movie to watch. Enjoy the performance by Elizabeth Montgomery!",1462320000,,1107,4.715025906735751

6244494,5,B00HZVX14O,"I loooooove this little TV movie. I saw it when it was broadcast. When it was rebroadcast (usually Halloween fare, or the August anniversary), I taped it. This was many years ago. After my homemade VHS wore out I searched for it assuming it was available. It wasn't. I waited for several years, then finally paid 50 bucks to a ""rare file"" organization to get a TV copy of this and several other TV movies never released. Eventually it was available on Youtube and as a movie-on-demand. But I'm thrilled to see that it is FINALLY available. When I first heard this TV movie was being made I thought Liz Mongomery was an awful choice- just too pretty, too ""modern"" looking. However she does a really good job and the supporting cast is really good. As a Lizzie Borden ""fan"" I'd read about the theory that Lizzie stripped naked, hacked up the old lady and the old man, bathing herself in between and redressing. It seems ludicrous  that a Victorian Sunday school teacher would even think of the idea- however Lizzie was one of those ""trapped"" ladies who felt imprisoned by her father and step mother and, of course, the limitations of an old maid in that day and age. I mean what's a girl to do? Daydream about murder! It's just not likely that anybody other than Lizzie was the killer. Today she'd be convicted....well, perhaps not!

6244512,5,B00HZVX14O,"Elizabeth Montgomery is best known as Samantha the beautiful witch married to Darren in series tv ""Bewitched."" She made a second career for herself when that show ended by making made for tv movies. This was a new concept to television when she entered it as cable tv and the internet were years in the future. This is one of her made for tv movies and it is perhaps her best loved. At times this has been difficult to find so that it is available again is good news for her all of her fans.

Most of us know the story of true life Lizzie Borden but Montgomery gives us one interpretation of what could have been the real story behind the true story. For anyone who does not know: Lizzie Borden was in real life acquitted of murdering her father and stepmother with an axe in their shared home. Most people nonetheless have always believed she was the murderer. Since her father and stepmother were such miserable, miserly (yet wealthy) people, sympathy for Lizzie comes about, no matter if you believe she was guilty or not.

Montgomery does a wonderful job in this part. Recently Christina Ricci has taken on the part in a tv version. I also saw that. I liked what Ricci did with it but I believe the Montgomery one will always be first with me. For one, I simply adored her as Samantha.",1441584000,,1289,4.411764705882353

I think they're all available now on DVD, I have Sole Survivor, and I highly recommend getting them. If you remember them from your youth don't worry, they've all aged very well, this movie included.

Elizabeth Montgomery's treatment of the accused axe murderess, Lizzie Borden is intriguing.  Some modern detectives have theorized that Borden may have indeed done what Montgomery portrays and thereby got away with one of the most heinous acts of murders in our history.

A&E ran it in the 90s and I haven't seen it since then. It is wonderful to finally have an uncut copy at my disposal. I like how the ragged cover art makes it look like an Exploitation flick when in truth it couldn't be any more subtle and understated as a horror movie. Actually its more a psychological thriller which I prefer over gratuitous slashers and Miss Liz delivers perhaps the best post-Bewitched performance of her illustrious TV career. What a delight to see her chilling no-holds-barred-anything-but-Samantha-Stephens portrayal of the infamous ax-murderess.

The supporting cast is a top-notch roster of familiar character actors (though you may not know all their names, youll certainly recognize the faces) and this is undoubtedly one of the best TV-movies of all-time, whether you're a Liz fan or not.

The film doesnt give us a clean-cut resolution and the ambiguity works in its favor. The climactic flashback seen through Lizzies mind is played mostly in silence which adds to the creepiness rather than having a frightening, accompanying score try and manipulate the viewer.

The print hasn't been remastered and looks a little grainy, but considering this was a period-piece to begin with, its actually appropriate.

6244543,5,B00HZVX14O,"This 1975 version is the grand lady of all others. It keeps to the facts with excellent performances by the actors and a brilliant creepy music score that truly sets the tone for this macabre mystery!  The sets and the costumes are perfect. It makes you feel like you are in the late 1800's. The soundtrack is great. Elizabeth Montgomery as ""Lizzie"" was the perfect choice for casting. When she smiles (when ""Emma"" brings her a new hat) she lights up the room. When she is mean spirited (when she goes down in the middle of the night to look at the dead bodies) she strikes fear in your heart. When she is afraid (when ""Emma"" tries to comfort her while she is in jail) you feel sympathy. When she is aloof (at the coroner's inquest) you don't know what to think. And when she says ""If I were not a lady, I should twist your arm Mrs. Borden right out of it's SOCKET"" - run. The casting choice of Fritz Weaver as ""Andrew Borden"" could not have been more perfect. When he comes home and scampers off to his study room, when he's eating his mutton broth, when he is embalming a corpse - just the perfect guy for the role. An unsung hero in this movie in my opinion is Helen Craig who plays ""Mrs. Borden."" She is not in the movie for long but her performance is just great. Ed Flanders as ""Hosea"" the prosecutor is also perfect for the part. Just a great job casting this movie.

There is a popular belief that Lizzie Borden took an axe and whacked her mother and father. One writer even imagined Lizzie being condemned and hanged! In fact, Lizzie was found not guilty and returned guiltless to her home. But popular opinion still thinks Lizzie Dunnit. Aside from the correct jury verdict, most violent murders are done by men, women prefer to use poison. There are exceptions to this rule. This murder trial attracted national attention during 1893, when the worst depression of the 19th century occurred.

Abby was the stepmother of Emma and Lizzie. Emma was on vacation at that time in Fairhaven. Lizzie, the younger daughter, was more outgoing than her older sister.

Only five people slept in that house the night before the murder. Uncle John left after breakfast and had an alibi for that morning. Bridget the maid was seen outside around 9:30 when Abby was killed. Lizzie was seen outside around the time Andrew was killed. Neither could have done both murders. Could they have cooperated in the murders? No one believed that idea. The obvious solution was an someone else who did it and left without being seen. There was no suspicion at the time. Could a man have walked by without being seen? Did Lizzie denude herself to commit both murders and have no bloodstains on her clothes? Her lawyer said proper New England ladies would not do this! Given the facts the jury quickly decided on not guilty. No one has ever provided any proof of Lizzies guilt, but some still claimed Lizzie Dunnit

If you want to really know if this book is for you, go to your local library.

6244550,3,B00HZVX14O,"I saw this a long time ago but about the only thing I remember was that she took her clothes off to commit the murders, then stood in a basin of water to wash off the blood.

My review will contain spoilers. This came out on TV so I guess they didn't have much time to get a lot of the subtleties in, but they tried, even making stuff up, like Andrew Borden touching a dead woman's body with Lizzie, hidden, watching him, or him making her touch the dead body of a woman to show her there was nothing to be scared of. This is the only time I've ever seen or heard of this, so it seems added and I didn't believe it. I had read before about Mr. Borden killing Lizzie's pigeons, so that at least seemed authentic.

When Lizzie goes to kill her stepmother, she takes off her clothes, but leaves her hair up. When she goes to kill her father, she undoes her hair and fluffs it out. Why? Either way, blood would have gotten in her hair and surely at least Bridget would have noticed that her hair was wet. Wherever Lizzie walked would have had drops of blood (didn't show her cleaning up any) and Lizzie's rug also would have gotten bloody and wet from her standing in the basin washing off.  Stealing the axe from the store was pretty far fetched.  When the shopkeeper tells the customer who saw Lizzie ""taking something"" that it doesn't matter, because Andrew Borden will pay, he doesn't even know WHAT she stole. What's he going to put on the bill - Miscellaneous?  Wouldn't he notice that an axe was missing from his inventory? What shop puts an axe on a table anyway? A little kid could have come in and cut his hand off.

Lizzie tells Bridget to go lie down before the noon meal, then she retrieves the basin, axe, etc., and kills her father (who has quickly fallen asleep, although supposedly she says his name so he will look at her, then hits him). Then she washes off, redresses, and drops the axe down the indoor privy. They never find it, although in 1860 England, Francis Kent's body was found in the vault of an outhouse.

Bridget testifies that it was only three or four minutes after she lay down that Lizzie started hollering that ""Somebody killed Father!""  So that was pretty quick to commit murder and get cleaned up (or was she supposed to have already killed him?). Also kind of dumb. Lizzie should have told Bridget to lie down and that she was going to leave the house and do something, then waited for Bridget to find him.  Then Lizzie could come back home. It would have looked a little better anyway (for Lizzie).

Wouldn't five days of mutton broth be enough to make anyone want to kill?  I can't imagine having to wear all those petticoats and chemises and high necked, long sleeve dresses in that heat either. Or having to wear those huge ugly hats in court. The film shows the prosecutor's wife having some empathy for Lizzie's situation - as a woman, trapped, without rights.  Of course Lizzie wasn't really trapped.  She could have left and done whatever she wanted (except vote or be on a jury), but it wouldn't have been easy. And Lizzie had never worked.  Were all the protestors outside the courthouse not really believing that Lizzie didn't kill her father and step-mother, but just feeling sorry for her living with such a mean tightwad? And hadn't Andrew Borden changed his will already? The film says he didn't. Was his wife wanting him to write out his daughters entirely? What happened with the morphine? Wouldn't Lizzie have been totally addicted if she'd been receiving it since the murders until she was on trial? Apparently the filmmakers made up their own testimony.

Now the price has gone down again on this DVD by $2.50 from what I paid.  Unless you are intent on having a Lizzie Borden collection of some kind, I think it is only maybe worth $7.99 at the most. But who doesn't love Elizabeth Montgomery?",1430697600,,3849,4.469329529243938

6244582,3,B00HZVX14O,"The Legend of Lizzie Borden, 1975 film

There is a popular belief that Lizzie Borden took an axe and whacked her mother and father. One writer even imagined Lizzie being condemned and hanged! In fact, Lizzie was found not guilty and returned guiltless to her home. But popular opinion still thinks Lizzie Dunnit. Aside from the correct jury verdict (repeated in countless moot juries in law schools), most violent murders are done by men, women prefer to use poison. There are exceptions to this rule. This murder trial attracted national attention during 1893, when the worst depression of the 19th century occurred.

Abby was the stepmother of Emma and Lizzie. Emma was on vacation at that time in Fairhaven. Lizzie, the younger daughter, was more outgoing than her older sister. Edward Radins 1960 book on Lizzie was the first to suggest another person; but Bridget was never a suspect after the first day. Most people are never happy unless they can hate or look down on somebody or something. You can see examples on the Jerry Show on television; watch the audiences reaction to the actors on the stage. Note how some cases are publicized in the Corporate Media to distract people from their daily concerns (OJ, Casey Anthony, etc.). Do you believe everything you read in the newspapers or see on TV? Ever wonder why the murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman received so much play so you forgot about what happened in May? Know what they didn't report?

Only five people slept in that house the night before the murder. Uncle John left after breakfast and had an alibi for that morning. Bridget the maid was seen outside around 9:30 when Abby was killed. Lizzie was seen outside around the time Andrew was killed. Neither could have done both murders. Could they have cooperated in the murders? No one believed that idea. The obvious solution was an UNSUB who did it and left without being seen. There was no suspicion at the time. Could a man have walked by without being seen? Did Lizzie denude herself to commit both murders and have no bloodstains on her clothes? Her lawyer said proper New England ladies would not do this! Given the facts the jury quickly decided on not guilty.

No one has ever provided any proof of Lizzies guilt, but some still claimed Lizzie Dunnit (as if to satisfy their own psychological needs to believe this). David Kents Forty Whacks is the one best book on this unsolved riddle. Kent reported the facts. So who did it? Arnold Brown, a native of Fall River, wrote the best solution (a relative whose presence was kept secret). So watch this movie as an entertainment, not as a history lesson. It was shown on TV during the spring of 1975 during the Ford Recession. It gained publicity from the flash of a butt. Was it meant as a distraction from the economic recession that marked the end of the good times of the 1950s and 1960s? Arent most movie created as distractions from peoples humdrum lives? A movie that tries to educate can be controversial (like Oliver Stones JFK).",1421539200,,3016,4.706439393939394
6244583,5,B00HZVX14O,I've been searching for this movie for years!,1421539200,,45,4.75
6244584,4,B00HZVX14O,"Daughter of actor Robert Montgomery, actress Elizabeth Montgomery (1933-1995) began her professional career in 1950s television and was soon well-regarded in the industry.  In 1964 she was cast in the role of Samantha Stephens, a supernatural witch with a fondness for mortals, in the television comedy BEWITCHED, which had an extremely popular eight-season run.  After the series ended, Montgomery sought out significantly darker roles in an effort to stretch her talents and expand her career.  In 1974 she appeared as the lead in NBCs television movie A CASE OF RAPE, a highly controversial but well received drama in which she played a rape victim.  In 1975 she followed it with ABCs THE LEGEND OF LIZZIE BORDEN.

The Borden case was and is notorious.  The Borden family of Fall River, Massachusetts consisted of Andrew Borden, his second wife Abby Borden, and his two daughters by a previous marriage, Emma and Lizzie.  The family was wealthy, but Andrew Borden was known to something of a miser, and there rumors of emotional strain, particularly between the step-mother and daughters.  On 4 August 1892 Andrew and Abby Borden were viciously murdered with an ax or hatchet.  Lizzie was accused of the murders.

THE LEGEND OF LIZZIE BORDEN is often described as the most accurate film version of the case.  That is true in the sense that the courtroom scenes make use of the actual transcriptbut LEGEND is often precisely that: legend, the story as the average person may have heard it, distorted by passing time and changing opinions.  The film also has a rather unexpected feminist slant, which was unlikely for 1892 but very much top of mind in the mid-1970s.  But be it fact or fiction, it is remarkably compelling, and it has survived the passing of time with a strength most made-for-television movies of its era lack.

The overall cast is very, very strong, with Katherine Helmond as sister Emma and Fitz Weaver as father Andrew particularly memorable.  The script and production values are also very strong, and the cinematography, which often has the quality of a sickly hallucination, is unexpectedly good for a television film of the period.  Oddly, the one off-note is Elizabeth Montgomery herself, who is much too modern in voice, body language, and attitude to be entirely believable as a thirty-ish spinster of the 1890s.  But strange to say, this actually adds to the films shuddery sense of unease: Lizzie is presented an increasingly neurotic woman who is different from everyone around her, and period-appropriate or not, Montgomery gives a powerful performance.

The movie is very much of its era: Montgomerys make-up includes eye-liner and heavy mascara and her hair, when worn loose, is styled in a razor-cut, elements which are sometimes distracting and sometimes amusing.  Television movies of the 1970s were also filmed on the cheap, and that occasionally shows as well, but director Paul Wendkos (who had an extremely long career in television) gives the film a solid but unexpectedly dreamy pace.  Will we ever know the truth of what happened in Fall River on that hot August day in 1892?  Probably not.  But THE LEGEND OF LIZZIE BORDEN is unexpectedly powerful stuff.

This version is so much better and more accurate. I have been to the Lizzie Borden house and the inside for this film is spot on, however the outside is not. There is no front porch, only a stoop, but the way the house is laid out inside is exactly portrayed in the film. When I went, I also saw the dress that Elizabeth Montgomery wore at the end of the film.

After watching this movie, I naturally became curious & in doing some research, I found the movie to be accurate for the most part.  From the plot, I got the impression that Ms. Borden was molested by her father - which might explain her motive, but nothing was mentioned in her biography regarding sexual abuse.  Her father did seem to have a mean streak and so did her stepmother, but the motive wasn't made very clear.  Perhaps it was never clear.

Elizabeth is a brilliant actress portraying Lizzie Borden and although the theme of an ax murderer is not something I'd typically watch I did pre-order this and did enjoy watching it.  Did I have to turn my head away and close my eyes at certain parts?  Yes.  But this movie isn't as gruesome as today's movies.  Lizzie is shown stripping (but no nudity is shown) when she murders her father and mother-in-law with an ex.  You do see the blood splattering on Lizzie's face and body, and then afterward you do see her washing herself off.  So with that said, I do not recommend this film for young children.

Actress Katherine Helmond from the TV show ""Who's the Boss?"" is featured in this as Lizzie's sister Emma Borden.  She also does a great job.

This movie is based off of a true-story and it assumed that Lizzie did indeed kill her father and mother-in-law with an ax.  But Elizabeth Montgomery portrays the role in such a way that you feel somewhat bad for her while watching flashbacks of her upbringing.

6244630,5,B00HZVX14O,"Wow. I remember watching this when it first aired on ABC TV in February of 1975. Elizabeth Montgomery was actively moving away from her charmingly comedic role as Samantha Stevens on Bewitched (ironically, also an ABC offering), and Lizzie Borden was her second lauded dramatic performance after ""A Case of Rape."" Her performance here is just amazing--nuanced and layered. Was Lizzie Borden guilty? Could she have indeed committed the crimes as the film speculates? Hmm. My own feeling is that Lizzie may not have actually done the deed(s), but she definitely was involved in some way or the other. She and her sister had the most to gain from the deaths of her father and annoying stepmother. What I like about this film is its structure--though the sets are simple, the direction is superb, the musical score sublime, and it has all the earmarks (except for the overuse of the zoom lens on occasion) of a big budget, big screen production. And it's surprisingly gory! If you've studied the actual Borden case (I have), you'd understand that this is surprisingly true to its source material...though I doubt the real-life Lizzie was as attractive as Lizzie Montgomery.

While the story has LOTS of holes in it and it based in part on a rather worn scenario, it is, nonetheless, a good review of this 1892 double-murder case in Fall River, Massachusetts. The case is unsolved and the story told here is only one perspective on this famous event. I teach this case in my Advanced Criminal Investigation class at a small 4 year college. This film helps to confront the people, the facts, the evidence and the myths about the case. For example, although the children's song talks about 40 whacks, the victims probably got 17 to 20 each.....I guess that was still enough to get the job done! Entertaining for a pseudo-documentary and well worth the price. So, do you think Lizzie did it?!",1414022400,7,877,4.556962025316456

This is a landmark production that seems to have been forgotten and lost, but now it is here to stay and savor once more.

6244638,4,B00HZVX14O,"I love that this movie is finally out on DVD!! I ordered my copy from Amazon, not an outside seller. Amazon states that the Studio releasing the DVD is New Video Group. Hmmm....on the DVD case sitting in front of me it says ""marketed & distributed by Cinedigm"". It is a Flatiron Film, NTSC, CBS logo shows on the back and it is in Full Screen Format (1.33 or 4:3 ratio).

When watching the DVD on a standard  27"" flatscreen TV, the picture fills the screen with great clarity. Periodically you will see the tiny white specks that appear when a movie is transferred to DVD. However, it is barely noticeable. Overall, the picture is very good, the sound is very good and even the darker scenes are easy to see. Just what I would expect from a DVD.

When watching it on our Panasonic 42"" HD Plasma TV in Full Screen mode, we did notice a slight bit of grain but not enough to distract us. However, the indoor scenes were obviously darker and the picture had too much red in it. The sound was very good. Now...to be fair, we all know that we set up our TVs according to what programming we watch the most. Our HD TV is set to bring out perfection in sporting events. Our Standard 27"" flatscreen TV is set up for movies.

Since I am seriously attached to my Standard TV I am more than happy with what this DVD showed me. But I can't say that someone who watches HD movies on an HD TV will feel the same way. I would enjoy the movie on either TV but would have to make adjustments to the HD TV to accommodate standard DVDs.",1413331200,9,1517,4.202749140893471

6244649,5,B00HZVX14O,"To date, this is the most historically accurate movie on Lizzie Borden.  Much of the dialogue came from the actual testimonies of the Coroner's Inquest and the trial.  Expertly cast, the script was as close that's come to what really took place.  Because of this, I have an old VHS copy I must have watched 50 times and will buy the dvd when it is available.  Some things were not historically accurate, and it may have been to condense the film.  Lizzie's maternal uncle, John Morse, is left totally out and he played a big part in it all.  The movie does put forward a whodunit theory, which I don't agree with.  But it was necessary for the film.  I have studied this case for over ten years.  Still waiting for someone to make a movie on it that is historically accurate.  But the other Lizzie movies are just junk compared to this fascinating and pretty true movie that is still good after 39 years.

If you have any interest in Lizzie Borden and the murders, this is the movie to have.  It is a collector's item, and I think the price may go up after its release, so pre-ordering is a good idea.  Many have been waiting for this to be put on dvd, and sales will probably go fast.",1405814400,6,1185,4.3076923076923075

6244659,5,B00HZVX14O,"My five stars are for the film itself, a quality piece all the way. I had a hunch the recent to-do about the Christina Ricci Lifetime film on Lizzie would stir up interest in this earlier (and superior) film, and result in it finally getting an official DVD release - how happy I am to have been right! I have collector's and gray market copies of this title, the latter purchased at horror conventions, but I'm hoping the company releasing the film will be able to get a good negative and/or apply some judicious digital massaging to bring the color back to grade. I also hope that the original chapter endings, as seen in the two ABC broadcasts and ever after edited out, will be back (the screen fades to sepia as the title of the film appears, and we hear a chorus of little girls singing a discordant melody). This was one of Elizabeth Montgomery's finest (two) hours, the role that convinced everyone she was more than ""Samantha Stevens."" She was nominated for an Emmy Award for her complex portrayal of the arrogant but easily hurt Lizzie Borden, but lost to Maureen Stapleton for her outstanding turn in the semi-musical THE QUEEN OF THE STARDUST BALLROOM (oddly enough, both LIZZIE BORDEN's creepy chamber score, with electronic keyboard - a first, composer Billy Goldenberg told me - and the music for QUEEN were composed by Mr. Goldenberg). While the 1975 film's Fall River, Massachusetts Second Street exterior is too farm-like (and those hills!), and the outside of the Borden house is too grand, the interiors are near-copies of those of the original house, except for the changing of the woodwork and moldings from the original white to brown, and the widening of the parlor doorway. Also, the ladies of Fall River did not wear black liquid eyeliner, but the film was made in 1975, after all, when everyone did! This was also a notoriously bloody film for a 1970s TV project, which resulted in several affiliates in Texas refusing to show it at all. Another oddity is that the film, written by William Bast, was being prepared by the cult director Curtis Harrington, who was relieved of his duties shortly before the cameras were to roll and replaced by Paul Wendkos. In any case, it stands as THE movie on the infamous Borden murders, and I'll cheer when I have the new DVD in my hands!",1394409600,4,2302,4.672413793103448

6244663,5,B00HZVX14O,"I'm thrilled this Classic TV movie chiller is finally receiving a (long overdue) DVD release in America.
Originally broadcast February 10, 1975, ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden"" was a shocking TV movie. And it is still spooky and unnerving. I remember the premiere broadcast was accompanied by all sorts of ""Parental Guidance"" warnings..
 Despite the disturbing subject matter, ""Legend Of Lizzie"" really raised the bar for TV movies. Everything about the production; the sharp and intelligent teleplay by William Bast, excellent direction by Paul Wendkos, appropriately disconcerting film editing by John A. Martinelli, the off-center musical score by Billy Goldenberg, and definitely, Elizabeth Montgomery's tour-de-force performance as the accused and acquitted axe-murderess, is first-rate.
  The tone of the film is deliberately and immediately off-center. ""Mrs. Churchill, do come in,"" Lizzie says, ""Someone has killed father."" Elizabeth Montgomery delivers this first line matter-of-factly, without any emotion. After the dead body of Andrew Borden (Fritz Weaver) is discovered, a children's chorus starts singing in frightening fashion over the opening credits. The audience is thrown off balance before the plot has even began. Director Paul Wendkos immediately establishes a rising and relentless level of tension. We are in Lizzie Borden's world, and it isn't nice. We learn about  Lizzie's  life with her father, stepmother Abbey (Helen Craig) and older sister Emma (Katharine Helmond) in a series of quick-cut, often jarring flashbacks, brilliantly edited by John A. Martinelli.
  Elizabeth Montgomery's haunting, Emmy nominated performance will keep you spellbound. The title, remember, is ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden""; ""Legend"" suggesting things that will never be known. Montgomery plays Lizzie Borden with a shrewd and cunning aura of mystery. At times, Lizzie seems like a human question mark. What was going on inside Lizzie Borden's  head?  Elizabeth Montgomery's performance subtly suggests that many things were happening simultaneously inside Lizzie's head. Cool and mercurial, the private Lizzie Borden (and Elizabeth Montgomery) seems ready to snap at any moment into a violent breakdown.
  William Bast's teleplay, an absorbing mixture of historical fact and dramatic speculation, takes the position that Lizzie definitely did snap and, for various reasons, got away with murder. In the 1890's, people just didn't believe that a woman would or could commit such gruesome murders. After all, Lizzie Borden was a Sunday School teacher; and there was no blood on her dress! The movie vividly dramatizes how Lizzie Borden axe-murdered Andrew and Abbey in the nude! Part of the film's genius is that it states that Lizzie got away with murder and you still feel sympathy for her. You see  everything from inside Lizzie's head. Andrew and Abbey seem so objectionable, you don't really care that they are axe-murdered. In fact, I practically cheer every time the court finds Lizzie ""not guilty.""
  Although she did not receive the Emmy Award she deserved, the modest Elizabeth Montgomery took justifiable pride in her multi-layered performance. Her subsequent TV  movie roles were often even darker than Lizzie Borden. Afterwards, she asked close friends to call her ""Lizzie"" and she kept the film's prop axe in her home above the fireplace.",1391904000,93,3357,5.529296875
6244664,5,B00HZVX14O,"""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" is so good not only in its performances, direction, and overall production, it is historically accurate. Nominated for 5 Emmys including ""best actress,"" this film won for outstanding costume design and film editing. Actress Elizabeth Montgomery known for television's ""Bewitched,"" gives a surprisingly chilling and unforgettable performance as Lizzie Borden. The effective use of authentic speech and dress attire of the period  makes the viewer feel at once he has traveled back to 1892. At times, ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" appears dimly lit as if shot with only oil lamps in the Borden home, giving the film a wonderful dark sinister look. As the camera closes in and focuses on Lizzie Borden's face, the film flashes back to scenes, sometimes contradicting courtroom testimony leaving the viewer to decide what really happened. An interesting fact (although she did not know it) is actress Elizabeth Montgomery was a distant cousin of Lizzie Borden herself! Genealogy research by Rhonda McClure reveals both Elizabeth Montgomery and Lizzie Borden were descendants of 17th century John Luther of Massachusetts making them 6th cousins once removed.
As cold detached Lizzie, Montgomery is subtle and unpredictable in her expressions and demeanor. The viewer can see there is something going on behind Lizzie Borden's seemingly unemotional facade, and gets a glimpse of a disturbed woman with secrets. Elizabeth Montgomery shot some key scenes in the nude (in a closed set) to show one possible theory of how Lizzie Borden could have murdered her father and stepmother without getting any blood on her. However because this was a movie made for television, it does not show nudity. The only minor distractions that perhaps take away from an otherwise perfect film are spots when a few scenes fade to black, indicating where t.v. commercials were placed. Elizabeth Montgomery breathes life in her disturbing portrayal of Lizzie Borden and is convincing in a very difficult role that  earned her an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. The story and events are examined and much of the film takes place in the courtroom with actual testimony taken from the real Borden trial. The maid Bridget Sullivan (Fionnula Flanigan) and the determined prosecutor, Hosea Knowlton (Ed Flanders)are captivating. Resembling the family patriarch,  Fritz Weaver gives a fascinating performance as the complex Andrew Borden. Flashbacks of Lizzie Borden as a young girl with her father add mystery to the story. ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" premiered in February of 1975 with no special effects. The film relies on it's performances and a story brilliantly recreated about the infamous hatchet murders of Fall River, Massachusetts. The haunting score from Billy Goldenberg enhances the creepy feel to the film. ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" is mesmerizing and a must see!",1391904000,59,2881,5.286026200873362
