3736305,5,B001OPQIGK,"Since Cartoon network took it off the air few years back, It's a miss. Right now I own from all season one and have order few
more season two I must say it's a great story line and i loving it. That is why I will soon have all the collection of one piece.

SO HEY ONE PIECE SEASON ONE FOURTH VOYAGE, ALL ONE PIECE ROCKS.",1306627200,,320,3.8484848484848486
3736306,5,B001OPQIGK,"Kick that weak-ass 4Kid dub to the curb. One Piece comes uncut and unedited, redubbed, the way it was supposed to be seen from the good folks at Funimation.

This 13 episode set covers the end of the Arlong Ark, plus Logue Town. Luffy battles Fishman Arlong, Nami formally joins the crew, and Buggy returns! There's plenty of action early on, then a lull of fluff episodes, before Luffy's second confrontation with Buggy the Clown. It has been said many times before, One Piece just keeps getting stronger and stronger. Catch this batch of episodes, because pretty soon, One Piece takes off the training wheels and will be blasting across the Grand Line.",1267056000,,654,4.787610619469026
3736307,5,B001OPQIGK,"I have only recently begun watching One Piece, and after the first few episodes, I was COMPLETELY submerged in it. I'm already up to episode 128! It's my current obsession, and if you would do yourself the pleasure of trying it out yourself, you won't be disappointed. The episodes in this set have all the qualities of the series that stand out. They are some of my favorite episodes because of this fact.

Like the other reviews mention, the episodes are uncut, which means they have swearing and fighting scenes including blood and such, but nothing too gruesome, which is why it has been rated Tv-14 on the Funimation website. These are the original Japanese episodes with your choice of the new english voice-over cast or the original Japanese with subtitles. Both are amazing and the english cast did a fantastic job.

I suggest buying from a cheaper seller through the Amazon website like I did. It has saved me significantly, especially if you are buying multiple DVDs. Even though you have to pay for shipping this way in my case it was still cheaper. See if any sellers are still selling them a bit cheaper! I only say this if you are a true fan planning on buying most of the series on DVD because there are a LOT or episodes left and ongoing for Funimation to dub (voice).

Overall it is worth the money. Buy this.",1262217600,5,1326,4.563025210084033
3736308,5,B001OPQIGK,"Although I would have enoyed it more if I didn't have to fork over $40 per box set to get season 1 for $160, the quality of the series is well done. this is the only box set for season one to include a grip of episodes that were not previously dubbed. a few episodes of the arlong arc, little buggy's bog adventure, and even a episode of the lougetown arc was restored to its brilliance. a must buy for One Piece fans.",1253836800,,418,4.048192771084337

3736313,5,B001OPQIGK,"It starts as they finish off Arlong and ends as they leave Loguetown for the grand line. As with the last 3 sets its completely uncut, although I thought this set had quite a bit more cussing than the previous 3. Looking forward up Season 2 voyage 1!",1238803200,,250,4.229166666666667
3736314,5,B001OPQIGK,"After ""Arlong's reign of terror"" the crew of Monkey D. Luffy is at it again in this Fourth Voyage.  What can I say about this awesome show?  It just keeps getting better, and better.  This DVD box set is the same as the others.  14 Episodes of pure fun, and adventure.  Marathon mode and some extra's are included, but not much to talk about.  This box set has episodes 40-53 as described by Amazon, which leads to the only complaint anyone has about this show.  The show is still going strong in Japan, with over 400 episodes.  It's going to take a while for the US to catch up, so one would only hope that Funimation will start to release bigger box sets. The voice acting is superb.  At first Luffy's voice takes you by surprise, but you get use to it and it really does fit his creature.  If you a parent of a young child, than I would suggest that you stay clear of this release and buy the 4Kids version, the 4Kids version is heavily edited but is more suitable for younger children (for instance, Sanji cigarettes are turned into lollypops).  This version is uncut, and contains violence, and cursing.  Overall, this box set has nothing new, but episodes.  It's the same packaging as the others, and continues a great story.  It's worth the money.",1238457600,5,1254,4.442982456140351

8331463,5,B001OPQIGK,"Funimation did sooo much better than cartoon network at bringing us an english version of One Piece!  Its not censored, they took care in translating it, and actually voiced it like they took a little pride in their work!",1366156800,,221,4.666666666666667

8331466,5,B001OPQIGK,"Oda Sensei is a genius. He's the one person I am physco over. One Direction? Nah, don't like them. Justin Beiber? Nah, don't listen to him. Naruto? It's good, I'll admit, but nothing that I'll go crazy over. One Piece? I would jump off a bridge to meet them. Even just Oda.

Oda has the imagination of a hundred little kids. Maybe even more. Ideas seem to pour out of his head like water out of a tap. It's all so natural for him. So right. It's like he was born to become a mangaka. Don't hesitate.
Read it,
Watch it,
Buy it,
Love it.

You'll never regret it.

Ever.",1331596800,,567,4.136363636363637
