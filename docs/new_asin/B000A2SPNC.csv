8278138,3,B000A2SPNC,"I bought this movie for one reason, because Charles Mesure plays firefighter Trent Holbrook. In this abridged version of the four-hour mini-series, he dies before the titles!

It's well done (no pun intended) with a lot of heroic man-against-the-forces-of-nature firefighting and a hero who has to overcome a past mistake that led to tragedy. I want the full version with more Trent!",1219968000,2,416,5.043478260869565
