8428758,1,B004GIS9ZU,the original show when it aired was 1:25 this disc is all edited to 0:59.  what's the purpose of that? Is vol. 2 going to be 0:26 ? and fyi there's no vol. 2 for purchase. I recommend strongly do not buy this disc,1403481600,5,213,3.840909090909091

8428760,4,B004GIS9ZU,it was great but on the 1st dvd u had to go into scene selection just to watch the whole thing other than that i loved it it was not worth 150 dollars like they said on pbs,1366588800,,172,3.5526315789473686
8428761,3,B004GIS9ZU,"I ordered this DVD after watching a PBS show showcasing this ED Sullivan comedy collection. I was thrilled at the thought of watching all the old comedians I grew up with. This DVD to me is more like an infomercial without the selling. There are definitely a bunch of the old comics I remember, but a lot of the DVD shows them already halfway through a joke and to me there is not that much time dedicated to just the comedians- seems that Mary Tyler Moore who is the hostess has more face time than the comedians. I would like to see them come out with a DVD that is truly an hour or more of solid performances- we know who these people were, we do not necessarily need so much introduction.",1313971200,16,692,4.25
