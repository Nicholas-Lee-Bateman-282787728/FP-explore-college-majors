8520043,4,B007OZF8CY,"This was a short (1 hour), interesting documentary based on the experiences of Karina Hollekim, who base jumps. She calls the free fall ""20 seconds of joy"" - thus the title.  It really made me think about what extreme sport athletes do. The documentary shows how much these athletes, and Karena in particular, give up to do what they do, but it also helps you understand why they do it.  It sounds very much like the thrill they experience is an addiction; when you watch it, see if you think so too.  It is a little dated, a lot has happened to Karina since the documentary was made. You can find Karena's blog on Facebook, and look on You Tube for a more recent account of her experiences in a TED talk.",1412467200,,705,4.325757575757576
8520044,5,B007OZF8CY,"Serious stuff. Not for the squeamish. Really delves into the joy involved, and the tragedy paid for that joy. None for me thanks, but I can understand the appeal. Saw it as part of the Banff Film Festival, back in the day. Still remember it vividly 5 years later. It is a really well-done movie, a compelling piece of story-telling. But not for everyone.",1391904000,,354,4.546875
