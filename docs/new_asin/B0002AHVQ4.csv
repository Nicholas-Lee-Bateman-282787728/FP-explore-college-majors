2073488,5,B0002AHVQ4,"Neal Ford is an excellent speaker and presenter. His presentation is concise. This is a great course for beginners trying to learn Java applications for the web. Neal Ford and DV Press, keep up the good work.",1118707200,,208,4.648648648648648
2073489,5,B0002AHVQ4,"Neal Ford is an excellent speaker, author, trainer and presenter.

This is an excellent DVD and a really great way to present the information, as opposed to reading a book, trying to learn on your own. It's great to have the author of the book giving the presentation. Neal Ford is exceptional. The information is very concise and well-presented. The video part of the program was well done. Thank you Neal Ford and DV Press.",1118620800,2,425,4.666666666666667
2073490,4,B0002AHVQ4,"This is a very good tutorial that covers a wide array of topics in Java. It has excellent audio and video quality. It covers from simple ""Hello World"" application to advanced topics such as JDBC and advanced syntax. However, the structure of the topics is not well designed for the beginner. I like it because I am in an intermediate level in Java programming and everything seems very clear to me. Still, it would be a little difficult for a beginner in Java to learn Java from this tutorial. I highly recommend this tutorial for any intermediate student who wants a brush up in Java.",1113696000,6,585,4.580952380952381
2073491,5,B0002AHVQ4,"Very good content and structure of Java basics:

1. Java Overview (J2ME|J2SE|J2EE)

2. Java Syntax

3. OOP Concepts

4. Exception Handling

5. Working in the Eclipse IDE

6. Much more, will append as I find the time to do so....

Video Quality: 5

Content: 5

Audio: 5

Editing: 4.99

Presentation: 5++

If you find it hard to sit down and read books or the SUN API  for hours at a time, then you'll find this an invaluable refresher/introduction to Java.

If Neal or DVDPress reads these reviews, PLEASE come out with a Java Intermediate/Advanced Course, possibly even a set for under $150. I'd like to see topics on Applets, Java Web Start, RMI, Threads, and XML.

At this price, compared to AppDev's/Keystone/CBT, this is a steal! So if you own a copy, please don't share! They really did a great job on this DVD and they deserve the revenue for this gem!

Thanks again Neal and DVPress!",1105056000,12,890,4.573248407643312
2073492,5,B0002AHVQ4,"Unfortunately not everybody can fit into Neal's busy schedule or afford his rate. So this DVD set is the next best thing to having Neal personally instruct you in developing Java applications. In addition, it is very reasonably price. Neal does a great job of covering all the practical topics a new Java developer will need to get started.
As a trainer, I review many books and computer based training products and I think this is the best CBT course I have ever seen. DV Press did a great job of combining the best of instructor led training with the best of CBT training. If I had to point out one negative about the training it is you can ask questions like you can of a live instructor but that is true with all CBT training.
Because I am a Java user group coordinator, trainer, mentor and author; I am often asked by those starting to learn Java what is the quickest and best way to learn. My answer use to be a particular book. Now my answer is the ""Beginner's Java 2 v1.5 2004 DVD training by Neal Ford""",1088553600,13,1011,4.326315789473684

8025207,1,B0002AHVQ4,"DVD Press is the most horrible video presenter and just like all their videos this one is bad too. A company that could teach software programs and stink at just making a program that doesn't have horrible video and sound should be illegal. How could you learn to make an editor when these people cannot script, edit, debug there own program. If this DVD was captured from a java page then the author must not know how to really build a java page well. The only thing good about this video is the name JSP2. Other than that this is just Neal Ford on a video talking about JSP2. There is no proof that he can write, script anything anybody could understand and it would crash as in made with errors. Neal Ford is about as pointless as a piece of hard copy paper with his name on it. Of course, it would probable have typos on it too.",1195776000,,832,4.238993710691824
8025208,3,B0002AHVQ4,"Neal Ford is certainly the best of DVPress (Now Defunct) speakers and he understands the subject well.  As with his other DVDs however, I was often distracted by mistakes and the later discovery of them being left in the presentation. He also needs to move the mouse a little slower.  There were times when his movement though a problem was so fast it was like a blur, with too much jumping around.  If he ever decides to do this type of thing again, he needs to edit the film a bit better so that the viewer doesn't have to replay certain scenes.  Neal does know his material though.",1151366400,,584,4.37962962962963
8025209,1,B0002AHVQ4,"I struggled through my first java course and managed to squeak by without really learning anything. I have one more course to take and wanted to give myself a head start with this DVD.

I bought it, played it and came very close to throwing it in the garbage can. The only reason I didn't is that it cost so much. The sound quality is terrible and the guy in the video just sits there telling you how Java is different than C++.

This video should have been called ""Java for people switching from C++ and who would like to know how Java is different.""",1138924800,2,551,4.238095238095238
8025210,2,B0002AHVQ4,"I want to learn just the basics of Java 1.5 Tiger version. Thought it covers the basis 1.2 only not any new features from Java 1.5 version.
I like the Author Neil Ford and I do own his books/DVD on JSP and Art of Web Development which are really good enough.
This is also good one but not really fair to call as Java 1.5 may be say Learn java 1.2 features using Java 1.5 jre. So if you are looking for Java 1.5 features don't waste your money on this..",1131148800,2,452,3.978021978021978
8025211,2,B0002AHVQ4,"I recently purchased java jsp VB xml c# ASP xml.

* The Sound quality is terible. They used a very cheap mic. instead of using a directional mic. I hope they will test next time before they release new dvd.

* The examples are hard to see on the screen because recording was not clear from their computer.

* The content is nice and it covers most details.

* It's always good to hear from another instructor.

* I recommend you to use headphones if you watch these dvds.",1127433600,4,471,4.247191011235955
8025212,5,B0002AHVQ4,"This DVD really worked for me, Technical books are good as a reference but this gives you a very good grasp of JSP's in a short time frame, great job Neil!

The only downside that I saw is the technical production, must be a better way to present the code rather than ""filmilng"" the computer screen, well maybe I should buy a 60"" HDTV screen after all!",1123891200,,352,4.253731343283582
8025213,5,B0002AHVQ4,"This is just excellent. I love how Neal Ford dissects Jsp in front of your eyes. Really learned a lot from this title. Keep up the good work, Neal.",1120953600,,147,4.103448275862069
8025214,4,B0002AHVQ4,"I am a VB programmer currently but programmed in C and C++ for a couple of years, years ago.  I found the presenter to be well spoken and thorough.  Covers each topic well.

The audio is sub-standard but is ok for the content being presented.  There are chapters (""Lessons"") on this DVD but there is no timecode.  So if you have to stop the DVD and come back, you have to just FF and RW until you find where you were within the lesson.

If you need a dynamic high energy speaker, go to a class.  This guy is calm, cool and collected.  Frankly I like his teaching style.",1120867200,,569,4.155963302752293
8025215,1,B0002AHVQ4,"The audio is so badly over-driven, I could hardly understand a word, and I developed a bad headache in about 2 minutes listening (or trying to listen) to the show. Same evening it was on the way back to Amazon. Even the best content is useless if delivered in such a bad way.",1118966400,2,275,4.2075471698113205
