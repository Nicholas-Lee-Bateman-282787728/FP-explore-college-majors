4977471,4,B00687JQ8Q,The quality of the picture isn't the greatest and so much of the beauty is lost due to it being in black and white but it was interesting to see the areas they visited nearly 60 years ago. I didn't know she and the prince parted after this trip but from watching her forced expressions and how at times she was treated inferior to him you could guess that she must have realized her mistake in marrying him due to their very different cultural beliefs.,1380326400,6,452,4.329411764705882
4977472,3,B00687JQ8Q,The video was ok but footage not always clear.  They sound was not that good either.  I somehow expected more.,1379635200,2,110,4.45
4977473,3,B00687JQ8Q,"If you're a die hard fan of the late Rita Hayworth, as I am, and intrigued with any aspect of her colorful, sometimes heartbreaking, life and career, you've got to have this newsreel-like documentary about her trip to Africa with her third husband, the late Aly Khan.  The reviewer wants to caution you that there really are only a few glimpses of the relaxed Rita on her ""African pilgrimage vacation"" and the
DVD of the 1950's documentary is amateurish and not that exciting.  Still you see Rita, at the time, enjoying only the beginning of the African trip because she abruptly left Aly due to his inattentive shenanigans, left the expedition, and returned home to the United States, having had her fill of the Aly Khan.  After the beginning footage showing Rita's safari enjoyment, she disappears from the film.  The filmmaker had the good intentions of documenting an exciting and decidedly exotic celebrity vacation trip, however its filmmaking technique and cinematography was only about B+, if that.  The buyer should be aware that this documentary was originally intended as a modest theatrical release and was filmed in color, while this DVD is from a black & white print of the original film, a notch or so down.  By 1952 Eastmancolor negative film was available and I believe that was the early color method of making the film.  The problem was that early Eastmancolor negatives and prints faded and lost color very, very badly and, likely, no color prints of the ""Champaign Safari"" still exist.  Incidentally, it was called the ""Champaign Safari"" because the Aly Khan spent money like water and, in point of fact, actually brought cases of Champaign along on the air safari to visit remote tribal villages of his Islamic followers. Aly was essentially a demigod to those who followed his father's religious cult of personality, thus Aly was a ""prince"" in his time.  Well, the sad fact is that Rita Hayworth wasn't having much fun in a life that was originally her escape from the pressures of Hollywood.  So the safari, as such, was a dud.  The documentary, while interesting to Rita fans, was essentially a low point in Hayworth's celebrity life, and one that I think she regretted.  That's the background to the film, and while it's not especially recommended, for fans that have got to see it, the DVD will give a glimpse into the Rita Hayworth lifestyle at the time when she gave-up a promising Hollywood career for the chance to become our first American princess.  Later, Grace Kelly would follow in her footsteps with somewhat better results.",1366675200,2,2561,4.873271889400922

8494644,2,B00687JQ8Q,"Poorly filmed by an admittedly non-professional film maker, this is really an odd little documentary which is little more than home movies. It follows Rita Hayworth and her then-husband, the Aly Khan, around a tour of Africa. No sound on the film and the voice-overs are weird, too; I was never quite sure if the man and woman who were doing them had actually accompanied Rita on her trip (although I think the film maker had) or they were reading from a script. Amazon states this film was ""miraculously saved"" but it's not restored nor completely intact, as there is much clumsy splicing throughout. Unabashedly racist, the commentary regarding the ""natives"" openly displays the film maker's/companions' staggering ignorance, as they regard these peoples as little more than animals in a zoo for their entertainment. I guess that was the standard mid-century mindset of the day, nauseating those it was. Far too much time is spent dwelling on one particular native festival's dancing and not enough on actually watching Rita's reactions to what she's seeing at any given location or event. As the Mrs. Aly Khan she had to appear at public functions, often in his place, and there's a taste of that. She actually appears to enjoy those tasks and, in spite of the searing African heat, manages to remain glamorous and composed. The commentary gushes over how very, VERY rich the Aly Khan and his father, the Aga Khan are, which gets tiresome quickly. By the end of the movie, Rita has left her husband and goes on a ""champagne safari"" with the film maker and others. It's important to them that this pseudo camping trip is complete with not only champagne but caviar and all the other four-star hotel accoutrements (silver eating utensils, crystal glasses, china plates, etc.) that the native porters must schlep from one place to another--still in that searing African heat--for the entertainment and benefit of Rita, et al. There's much fawning over how ""brave"" the men are for hunting the various wild beasts, which I found grotesque. The best part of the movie was clearly staged, Disney-style: A pair of lion cubs are shown eating raw T-bone steaks while one keeps the ""camp dog"" (a small rat terrier type) at bay by playfully pushing it away with his huge paws and, finally, holding it down. It doesn't appear that the dog was hurt which leads me to believe the whole thing was staged. If you enjoy weirdness and Hollywood glamour, watch this; otherwise, go watch a real Rita Hayworth movie.",1399852800,3,2497,4.863849765258216
