502723,5,6302641756,I found this movie very funny and amusing as it had Steve McQueen in a comedy roll. Very enjoyable and one the family can enjoy.,1314403200,,128,4.16
502724,5,6302641756,"We showed this movie at the theater I worked when it first came out. Except for the Martian-fearing sailor, overall I thought it was funny. I am a particular fan of the Hutton/Prentiss comedy pair-up.

A bit of trivia:

The type of computer program in this story did not exist in the late 1950s when this play was written, but did as of 1990 and is a form of artificial intelligence called a neural network. They were not developed until about thirty years after the play was written, so this story in a way foresaw their development, even the concept of a training set. Although probably not able to predict numbers of a roulette wheel spin because each result is independent of previous ones, neural networks can, by simulating the human brain, solve widely ranging problems using real data that are interdependent.",1196208000,,817,4.746478873239437
502725,4,6302641756,"Steve McQueen is still admired today. Like Marilyn Monroe and James Dean his talent has been recognized well beyond his years on the big screen. I grew up while he was alive and always loved his movies. He was excellent in a several dramas including ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"", but not many people have seen his comedic side. ""The Honeymoon Machine"" is probably his best role that showed his ability to do comedy. The support cast with stars like Jim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, and Dean Jagger is great. Richard Thorpe does an excellent job of directing.

When Lt. Howard, played by McQueen, plots a method to beat the casino using the Navies ship computer, things get interesting. Two other seamen join him in his plan to outwit the casino and when their girlfriends get caught up in the scheme, things get very funny. When McQueen's girlfriend that is an Admirals daughter tries to find out what is going on things get crazy. Then the Admiral thinks there is a subversive plot against the Navy, and the plan really goes haywire. This is a screwball comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Fans of movies like ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army"" and ""Operation Petticoat"" should love it. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys old or new comedies. I hope they put this on DVD soon.",1110585600,9,1293,4.646288209606987
502726,5,6302641756,"I saw this movie on TCM awhile back and was amazed it hadn't hit it big yet with the other classic movie junkies. Three navy officers form a way to cheat at the roulette table. Two of the officers develop romantic entaglements with the daughters of their commanders. There are multiple hilarious subplots, one including a bellhop trying repeatedly to deliver a chandelier. It is undertones like these that make this film great. Many films become dull when the lead plot isn't going on, but I could show any snippet of this movie and you'd still be laughing. The pickles I get myself into are nothing compared to those of Steve McQueen in this film.",1097884800,3,648,4.643478260869565
502727,4,6302641756,"The Honeymoon Machine is a very funny comedy starring unlikely comedian Steve McQueen.  The movie tells the story of three navy men who develop a scheme to win at the roulette tables in a Venice casino.  At first, their plan goes off without a hitch until Navy Admiral Fitch gets involved and suspects an invasion.  It only complicates things that McQueen is dating the Admiral's daughter.  This is a suprisingly funny movie with a good story, especially McQueen.  He reminded me of Jim Carrey some with the facial expressions he makes throughout.  After seeing him in so many roles as the silent loner type, it was good to see him in a comedic role.  The rest of the very humorous cast includes Jim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, Dean Jagger, and Brigid Bazlen as the Admiral's daughter.  Very entertaining comedy that will keep you laughing throughout.  Check out this McQueen comedy!",1054080000,20,879,4.845637583892618

502790,3,6302641756,Good movie with McQueen but the DVD stuck in places but I did get thru the movie! first time I ever seen it and I liked it but not the sticking.,1420675200,,144,3.6774193548387095
502791,2,6302641756,I like old romantic comedies but this one is just to dorky and silly,1420156800,,68,3.9285714285714284
502792,5,6302641756,"This movie was funny!  I was not sure what to expect and found myself voluntarily laughing.  When I find myself doing that...I know it is funny.  I do not know where people got the idea that Steve McQueen could not do comedy.  He was hilarious in ""Never So Few"" and if you ever watched ""WANTED: Dead or Alive"" there were some funny episodes.  This was funny because they all played off of each other and I knew all of the major players.  I had seemed all of them in other movies so the only stranger was the Admiral's (Dean Jagger can play a straight part in a comedy and come off believable) daughter.  Pretty young lady (Bridig Bazlen) and she played her part well!  Tim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, Jack Weston and Jack Mullaney were really good just as I knew they would be.  The four of them had the chemistry that comes together as an ensemble and they never missed a beat.  It is funny so I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!",1416787200,2,933,4.220338983050848

502818,4,6302641756,Funny but dated.  If you enjoy 60's or even 70's comedy then you will enjoy this one.  You pretty much had to have lived in the times......,1405468800,,139,4.111111111111111
502819,5,6302641756,"If you are a Steve McQueen fan, you'll love this one!  It is hilarious!  Some Navy officers figure out how to use the ship's computer to pick roulette numbers in Monte Carlo, and the ensuing mayhem when the Admiral finds out.  This is one to watch over and over.  Enjoy!",1405123200,,270,4.34
502820,5,6302641756,"This is a great example of a situation comedy - A group of sailors plan to break the bank at a Monte Carlo casino with the aid of a computer.  Steve McQueen gets involved with the Admiral's daughter and the fun begins.  Great All-Star Cast with Steve McQueen, Jim Hutten, Paula Prentiss, Dean Jagger, and Jack Weston.

Known mainly as an action star in Westerns and War Dramas, he is outstanding in this Situation Comedy.",1402963200,,421,4.586666666666667
502821,4,6302641756,"The Honeymoon Machine is a hilarious attempt of three men ( 2 navy officers and a scientist) to use the Navy's super computer to break the bank of a Venice Casino by creating a system to beat the roulette wheel.  Steve McQueen, a slick talking Naval officer, and Jim Hutton, the scientist, do an excellent job.  Two different styles, one brash and the other subtle, make the comedy work.  Jack Weston had an excellent role as a drunken SP trying to discover who's responsible while fearing a martian invasion.  McQueen showed in this role, as he did Soldier In The Rain and The Reivers, that he could handle comedy as well as drama.  Worth watching!",1401667200,,649,4.608695652173913
502822,4,6302641756,As I said it is a dumb movie but it has steve McQueen in it but I can't figure if this was before he was cool and they put him in this to see if he could carry it.  I don't think he carried it because until I saw it on a local TV station I never heard of it .  Really a fluff movie.,1396483200,,282,3.3230769230769233
502823,3,6302641756,"If you like '60's films that attempt to suggest that thoughts are changing about sexual and social mores, then this film is for you. It's presentation of social and sexual changes because it chooses to feature Steve McQueen's sex appeal instead. And, it is fun to see him in a comedy rather than an action flick. The comedy has a few twists and turns, and the end is rather abrupt, but all-in-all, the film is a lighthearted escape from reality.",1393977600,,445,4.575
502824,4,6302641756,Great movie of the early 1960's. Some romance and laughs worked together for a fun movie. I recommend this to anyone.,1393200000,,117,4.619047619047619
502825,5,6302641756,I loved this movie. I think that being the only comedy of Steve MacQueen it was very well done. Everyone acted very well!,1391212800,,121,4.304347826086956
502826,4,6302641756,Steve Mcqueen is very funny in this light hearted comedy. One of those classic 60's movies that is under rated. worth the time to watch.,1370044800,2,136,4.48
502827,4,6302641756,"Finally! I'm a huge Steve McQueen fan, this film was only available on VHS in the 1990s, but has been hard to find since. The VHS was only in full screen. This made to order DVD is in widescreen and nicely remastered.

As for the film it's one of the only times McQueen made a romantic comedy. It's a standard 1960s goofy romantic comedy. Definitely worth having if your a Steve McQueen fan.",1367107200,5,391,4.3561643835616435
502856,5,6302641756,"Love all Steve McQueen movies especially this one which is hard

502861,4,6302641756,"Steve McQueen is not known for his comedic roles so THE HONEYMOON MACHINE is a chance to see a different side of Steve McQueen. This is a silly but fun and pleasant comedy. A group of sailors connive to win at a casino in Venice, Italy with the help of a new computer on their ship. Sailors on shore and on the ship communicate with light blinkers that suddenly have the Russians and Americans in an uproar over what appears to be some sort of coded message for an attack. Totally silly plot but fun. Most of McQueen's comedy is from his facial expressions and how he tends to overpronouce his words.
Another fun part of the film is seeing familiar faces in the cast. Some of these actors I have seen through the years in TV roles but here they are young and fresh at the start of their careers. Lovely Paula Prentiss was such a mainstay in films in the 60's and here she is early in her career. Another actor who went on to bigger things is Jim Hutton.
The standout in this comedy is Jack Weston. Years later he appeared with Steve McQueen in the drama THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and again he was the standout in the film. Weston uses his comedic talents to the max as the sailor sent to investigate ""the blinker"" seen from the hotel. McQueen's gang offers him some liquor and Weston plays a hilarious drunk afraid of Martians. (Martians? Well, that is another story.)
Although THE HONEYMOON MACHINE is far from the perfect comedy, it does have charm and it is fun to see some classic actors working together. Sometimes we all need a bit of fun silliness and THE HONEYMOON MACHINE is worth the time.",1342742400,2,1597,4.398648648648648
502862,5,6302641756,"Admittedly this is not a great movie, but I throughly enjoyed its old-fashioned romantic story. If you require the overt sex, graphic violence, and lots of special effects which frequently dominate modern movies you won't find them here. But if a decent plot, competent acting, beautiful women, and old-fashioned romance appeal to you, I think that you will enjoy this movie.",1324944000,,375,5.163934426229508
502863,4,6302641756,"This is a pleasant piece of fluff with McQueen, Hutton et al having a wonderful time breaking the bank in Monte Carlo with the help of a navy computer.  All kinds of craziness going on and lots of fun had by all, quite a departure for Steve McQueen and its too bad they didn't find some more of this type for him.  I like this one and will no doubt watch it again down the road.",1320883200,,378,3.960526315789474
502864,3,6302641756,"By no means a great or even good comedy, it is worth seeing for a rare comedic role for Steven McQueen and for the supporting cast of Paula Prentiss, Jim Hutton, Jack Weston and Dean Jagger. Together, they make the most of a weak script based on a very minor play.  Will watch again.  There are some funny scenes, but for the most part, it comes across as a quickly adapted play.  There were scratches on the DVD.",1319932800,,413,4.269230769230769
