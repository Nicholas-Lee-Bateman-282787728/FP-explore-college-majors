8152438,5,B000JMKK5E,This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.  The dialog.  The people. A werewolf; a killer strait jacket;  an evil white hot lady doc. I now have a new understanding for the black lifestyle.,1448755200,,197,4.416666666666667
8152439,5,B000JMKK5E,"First off, I have NOT seen this movie.  But after reading the other reviewer's review, I would LOVE to see this movie.  Anything THAT bad HAS to be entertaining, and it doesn't matter that it's entertaining for the wrong reason.  Entertainment is not about reason.

On the other hand, I HAVE seen a different movie called ""Strait-Jacket"" starring Joan Crawford, and in my opinion, it falls into the aforementioned category (so bad that it's good) with the same satisfying ""thump"" that a severed human head makes when it hits the floor.  It's a William Castle production.  I shouldn't need to say anything more.",1238544000,,610,4.87378640776699
8152440,1,B000JMKK5E,This movie really sucked. Really BAD. HORRIBLE. The worst movie I ever saw. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it a zero. Please don't waste your time or money. Luckily I rented it first.,1234656000,,200,4.2894736842105265
