The lives and the destinies of the butcher, the chef and the swordsman
are entwined with the story of a cleaver, which was cast from the melted blades
of the most notorious swordsmen of the land.
This is a moral fable, which is supremely ironic, because the cleaver
has been fashioned for culinary glories, not for killing people.
The stories of the three principal characters are developed in a series
of nestled flashbacks:
The lecherous, buffoonish butcher will not be stopped-by any foe or adversity-
from winning the hand of the prettiest girl in the brothel of ""A Thousand Flowers"".
A ""mute"" young man will not be stopped-by any foe or adversity-
from avenging the murder of his family, on the orders of a malicious Palace Eunuch.
This young man is apprenticed to the famous ""Eight Courses"" master chef,
in the ""South Beauty"" restaurant.
The unscrupulous and greedy swordsman will not be stopped-by any foe or adversity-
from possessing the mightiest blade in the realm.
Director Wuershan creatively incorporates imagery from
several American, European and Chinese films.
This is a darkly humorous and fast film, which is effectively visualized
by a dazzling array of techniques: Fake vintage news reels, animation,
a hip-hop video clip, computer graphics, shots in black and white,
shots which resemble cheesy commercials with oversaturated colors, etc.
DVD image quality is excellent. Extras comprise a trailer of the film,
and several Fox World Cinema advertisements.",1371686400,3,1744,5.763565891472868
6991827,3,B00SNVHKHE,"Well, Doug Liman presents ""The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman."" I don't know what exactly this ""presents"" means, but I can tell you this.

""The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman"" is an action comedy, and with ""action sequences"" small in number and all choppily edited, this is hardly a martial arts movie. (The trailer is a bit misleading.) The film is light on action and heavy on comedy. That itself is not a bad thing. What is disappointing is the film's one-note narrative that seems going on aimlessly.

As the title suggests, ""The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman"" consists of three stories interconnected with each other. In all three segments - Desire, Vengeance and Greed - appears the same kitchen cleaver that changes hands over years. The narrative device is similar to that of ""The Red Violin,"" but is actually more ambitious. Maybe too ambitious.

The first segment is about a butcher smitten with a courtesan. This is followed by the second segment, ""a story within a story"" about a young cook. He is appointed by the restaurant's owner to serve dishes for a powerful and merciless Court Execution Officer Liu. In the middle of the narrative another tale begins, ""a story within a story within a story,"" a tale of a greedy swordsman, which explains the origin of the kitchen cleaver.

To make this kind of complicated narrative style, you need to be a skilled storyteller like Christopher Nolan, which the director of ""The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman"" is simply not. The director is Wuershan, about whom I know nothing about. Certainly the director has unique visual styles (and the hip-hop part is pretty good), but most ideas like video game-inspired fights look dated or clichd, and jokes are repetitious.

Blending traditional Chinese martial arts genre with Quentin Tarantino-like playful visual and narrative styles is a very good idea. Perhaps you remember ""Sukiyaki Western Django,"" a Japanese cult film, in which Tarantino and Masanobu And, who plays the chef in ""The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman"" appear. Both films have great ideas and visual styles, and both are in need of interesting stories and characters, which classics like ""Pulp Fiction"" have.",1352419200,4,2202,4.9728260869565215
6991828,1,B00SNVHKHE,"I ordered this movie, because it was produced by the same people who made Joy Luck Club, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan and Slumdog Millionaire.  This was a lousy movie.  I didn't even make it half way through.  I took it up to Vintage Stock and traded it in for store credit and bought something else.  From now on, I think I'll make sure to see a movie before I buy it.  Just because it was produced by the same group that made those other excellent movies doesn't guarantee that all movies made by that company are as good.",1347408000,,526,4.22
6991829,5,B00SNVHKHE,I have enjoyed Chinese film for over a decade; this is an exceptional piece. The cinematography is exceptional. The story is woven nicely. I can't think of another Chinese film to compare in recent times. This is a keeper.,1326931200,,222,4.717948717948718

8698968,5,B00SNVHKHE,"Disregard the negative reviews please. This is a terrific quirky movie that really makes good fun of the genres that it spoofs and does it well. At a macro level the storytelling is profound and clever and holds up despite all the jokes, slapstick, and ironies sprinkled throughout. It really is a clever storytelling  experience. I sat through the first part and wondered how I would ever get through it because the set-up takes some time, but its really worth it and left me feeling happy to have watched the movie. What a great blend of genres and comic storytelling. The acting is energetic and there are wonderful performances throughout. This is also a visual treat. A great blending of styles with an insightful eye behind the production.",1459555200,,745,4.8203125
