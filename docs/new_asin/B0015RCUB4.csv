3147152,5,B0015RCUB4,I have taken Tom's fitness class and he is the REAL DEAL! What you see and do in the DVD is exactly how Tom conducts his class and life! I love the DVD's and cannot wait for the next in the series.,1208390400,9,197,3.7142857142857144
3147154,2,B0015RCUB4,"Being a former runner and having limited time to work out, my work outs are indoors, and early in the morning.  I alternate between my spin bike, my elliptical, and DVD's.  My favorite DVD's are Bob Harper, some Jillian Michaels, and I love yoga at home.  I also own and alternate in some P90X, Insanity, and other Beach Body workouts.

This workout failed on every level for me.  First, it's very short.  Second, since it's claim is that it is a strength workout, it wasn't strenuous for me.  I'm almost 40, and since I love fitness I would guess that I'm stronger than the average almost-40-year-old woman, I would think that I should have at least broken a sweat and felt that I was working at least a bit harder than I did.

Finally, and I will keep this as brief as I can since I could probably rant on for some time about it, I didn't like the style at all.  It feels, for lack of a better word, sexist.  Commander Tom stands in front of a bunch of very fit women, all in full make up, and makes a few comments that felt off-color to me but might not phase the next person.

This one's going to Goodwill.  Hopefully whoever buys it will love it, since based on the reviews, it seems like a lot of people do.",1337904000,3,1213,4.226086956521739

I can work my arms, do a little push ups, sit ups, lunges and squats. I feel great after. Is a great work out for a woman that doesn't wanted get big but just toned.",1332201600,,332,3.625
3147156,5,B0015RCUB4,"I found this dvd to be upbeat, entertaining and easy to follow. Commander Tom gives good instruction and you can get a good workout regardless of fitness level, since you can modify moves if need be. I tend to get bored with workouts easily so I need to have variety. To combat this I mix workouts often or I will avoid using the dvds for a while and do something totally different then go back to them for a change of pace. This is where this particular dvd comes in.
Now I have to tell you that I haven't yet tried one of the SWAT workouts that I don't enjoy. Tom's personality is pleasant and he is motivating enough and more importantly, the workout method works for toning.
 I would say it's a great buy for the beginner or intermediate exerciser. I have seen other reviewers comment on the ""interaction"" between Tom and Mandy, but I never found it to be anything worth noting at all, until I read it in another review.

3147157,5,B0015RCUB4,"""S.W.A.T. Workout: Ultimate Body Definition"" is a workout you will want to do again and again. It is very entertaining and Commander Tom is an excellent instructor. The workout is divided into four sections. Well, the Power Workout is really a bonus but I do it along with the other workouts and it is fine. You could skip it and go straight to the Cool Down.

Here are the exercises you will be doing in each section:

Warm Up - Using three to five-pounds weights! Shoulder exercises, lateral lifts, front lifts, hammer curls, tricep presses, lunges and squats.

Ultimate Body Definition Workout - Bicep curls, tricep extensions, squats, shrugs, shoulder presses, lateral lifts, forward shoulder lifts, pushups, bicycles, bicep curls, hammer curls, alternating cross-chest curls, tricep presses, tricep kickbacks, squats, sumo squats and lunges.

Power Workout - Running on the spot, jumping jacks, marching, thrust with scissor (standing then down to the ground to plank then jumping feet apart - repeat), mountain climbers (plank moving feet in and out), boxer (squats with alternating knee lifts), lunges and football sprints.

Cool Down and Stretch - This could have been longer. There are just shoulder stretches, bicep stretches a trunk twister and hamstring stretch.

As you can see some of the exercises are repeated like the lunges and squats. You also get an excellent arm workout with lots of attention on the triceps which are sometimes neglected a bit so they need more attention.

If you are looking for a workout that is intermediate, won't completely wear you out to exhaustion and is fun and challenging then I can recommend this to you. This is one of the few workouts I will do again and again without complaint.

3147158,5,B0015RCUB4,"I recently purchased SWAT Workout: Ultimate Body Definition workout. I've been trying to find a strength workout tape that didn't have any aerobics. Sometimes, I just don't feel like jumping around. I'm so glad I found this DVD. This workout is a lot of fun and I really do feel it. The warm up doesn't seem to be a warm up, as to me it seems more like a mini workout. I have been doing the Ultimate Body Definition portion of the tape. It takes approx 10 minutes and you get a full body work out. I used to lift weights and as I got older and my strength has diminished, I'm finding this to be a really great workout. A great feature is it states what exercise you're doing now and what's coming up. It's nice to be able to prepare. What I really liked is they want you to use light dumbbells versus really heavy ones; which makes the work out even easier because you can actually work on your form and not get really tired. I use 8 lb dumbbells, but when it's time to do the triceps, I go for the 3.5lbs. I would really suggest this tape to anyone who wants to start off with strength training. I have several other exercise DVDs that I purchased at the same time, but I keep going to this one, over and over.",1274745600,,1211,4.157446808510638
3147159,5,B0015RCUB4,"I ordered the S.W.A.T. dvd and have used it almost everyday. This workout is showing results! Love toning your whole body, then I would recommend this workout dvd.",1269561600,,163,4.857142857142857
3147160,5,B0015RCUB4,"This is a great cardio workout and a good one to have in the rotation. I would rate it more of an intermediate level than advanced, but it still a very good workout DVD. The instruction is good and it doesn't exhaust you. I highly recommend it!",1266796800,,244,4.212765957446808
3147161,4,B0015RCUB4,"It is 35 minute weight training session, followed by a quick 10 minute cardio session.  The weight training consists of bicep, shoulder, tricep, squats, lunges, and pushup.  The 10 minute cardio can be done immediately following the strength workout, or as quick workout on it own.  It gets the heart pumping, and I think really burns up the calories in conjunction with the first workout.  However if in a bind for time, it would be okay on it own.  Overall, its a quick and effective workout in 35-45 minutes.",1266624000,,511,4.696629213483146
3147162,3,B0015RCUB4,"This video to me was just ok.  I work out a lot and wanted something at home for the days I don't make it to the gym.  It was a decent workout- nothing special.  I guess I get turned off when the instructor is into himself or there are too many heavy chested skinny women.  It is fake and unispiring to me.  I like the workouts where real people are working out like the rest of us and have real bodies, then I believe it is attainable in a $7 video and not in a $5000 dollar surgery.",1265673600,2,484,3.8979591836734695
3147163,4,B0015RCUB4,This workout has enough variety and is well segmented enough to challenge even the most experienced fitness buff and the gals look great! I do it before my kickboxing workout to get psyched and pumped. TRY IT!,1265155200,,209,4.675675675675675
3147164,5,B0015RCUB4,"This is a great DVD if you want a short weight training workout.  It's about a half hour in length (give or take) and there is a bonus cardio workout at the end of it that's about 10 minutes.
There aren't tons of reps and the weight part isn't as challenging as some other DVDs-but it's only a half hour and they seem to hit most of the major muscles.
Commander Tom also offers up tips on good form, which is helpful.
For a quick weight session, I like this DVD a lot.  If I want one that's longer with more reps and more muscles, I just use a different one.
This is a good DVD! Don't overlook it!",1263859200,,597,4.008403361344538
3147165,1,B0015RCUB4,"I have read the reveiws for this dvd, and most are very good. I am one of the few that are giving it a low rating. I have done a mouth of the insanity workout with Shaun t and a few of the charlean extreme workouts. This workout doesn t even come in the ballpark of those workouts. This is a good program  for people just above 'beginners"" A total body workout??? COME ON Your biggest muscle group in your upper body , is your back and chest. So you should spend more time and lift heavier weights in these areas. yet you work your bi s and tri s the most and use the same weight for tricept kickbacks as you do for one arm rows. Your biggest upperbody muscle group gets a little to no work. If you think this workout is advanced...do one of Shaun Ts insanity s workout, now thats advanced. Again good for medium fitness levels. I will bet alot of money, that Commander Tom didn't get his body from doing this workout!",1262131200,8,918,4.157303370786517

3147167,4,B0015RCUB4,"I really like this workout.  It's a good fit for those who are time-pressed like me. Only thing is the instructor is cheesy.  Especially when he talks about the hammer curls.  He calls it ""curls for the girls"", then does a sick-looking wink.  Ugh! To think he's around a group of women with no other man in sight, it's distasteful. I shudder and squirm whenever I get to this point, shake it off, then move on. Not sure though how many more times I can go through it.",1241395200,,467,4.2727272727272725
3147168,5,B0015RCUB4,Finally found a great starting point.  Nothing dancey.  Or hard to keep up with.  Use light weights or go heavy if you can.  This is a great place to start.,1234742400,,156,4.1
3147169,4,B0015RCUB4,"As stated in other reviews, this is a good workout from beginning to end.  Commander Tom moves you at a steady pace throughout the workout.  I felt like I had gone through a workout at the local gym after completing this dvd without leaving the house.  I agree with the reviews that mention the over abundance of skimpy clad girls - just a little over the top.",1231027200,,360,4.343283582089552
3147170,5,B0015RCUB4,"i really enjoy doing this video, even though i think commander tom has a crush on mandy ;) i don't really like how there are so many hot girls in the background, a tad overdone, but with all the reps and exercises i think it is an effective workout. id recommend it!",1229385600,,266,4.134615384615385
3147171,3,B0015RCUB4,"I have to say that this video is very effective.  You will feel the difference and the burn when you are consistant with both of the SWAT Workouts.  In the warm-up, I thought it went a little slow.  I just didn't feel quite as motivated with the SWAT workout as I have with other workouts.  Not to say that this is not a good video to use as I do alternate it with my other videos for variety.  You will sweat and you will feel better after each of the SWAT workouts.  But if you want motivation and excitement, you might want to try a different route.",1227571200,,552,4.11214953271028
3147172,5,B0015RCUB4,"It matters not whether you want to gradually get in shape or are already VERY pumped up...this will be a staple in your workout library. Not only is the instructor brilliant (in both S.W.A.T videos I have) at working muscles other dvds just don't seem to reach (he calls it a workout from your ears to your toes and he's right...it works every muscle..o.k., not really your ears or toes!...I workout daily but I'll feel his workout the next day in those places other videos don't get)
He's funny and outgoing and an amazing instructor...rare find in a workout video but it sure makes it go faster when it's enjoyable!  You'll learn how to do every move RIGHT. He is great at explaining form.  Just starting out? Use lighter weights...

This is the best strength training video I have ever found. It will change and firm your body RAPIDLY.

To get cardio and strength in one mega workout, try his other SWAT fat burning workout.

Combine the two and you really need no other video!

I have over 100 workout dvds...it's my favorite form of working out and he remains my favorite instructor. Nothing ""put on"" no ""fake toughness""...he's good at instruction, a great workout, but also entertaining to listed to repeatedly.

The set and the rest of the crew round out just a great dvd. I continue to check for a new release and hope we see one soon.",1227139200,6,1343,4.570833333333334
3147173,4,B0015RCUB4,Just buy the dvd. You'll like it. Get the weight loss one too. nI do both videos twice a week and do not diet at all. I have lost 3 pounds in 2 weeks!,1226275200,,150,3.4411764705882355
3147174,5,B0015RCUB4,"This and the Extreme Weight Loss and Fat Burning are by far my favorite workouts! For an intense training day, I combine both workouts for a serious cardio and toning regiment, and I can honestly say that (even though it's challenging) I WANT to do it! There are few workouts out there that I look forward to doing! Commander Tom is so great! His direction is clear and motivating, and he knows exactly how to train you so that you stay focused and strong, and really utilize all areas for a whole-body experience. My endurance, body tone, and stamina have increased tremendously since I've done the workouts. I use lighter weights (5-8 lbs) since there are lots of repetitions, but the idea is to keep the body moving, steadily raising and lowering the heart-rate, keeping the blood pumping so that your heart and lungs are working at the optimal levels. Commander Tom says that in doing these workouts he wants us to feel that we're in the best shape of our lives, and I can truly say I'm getting there! Everyday I do it, I feel stronger and happier!",1221091200,2,1052,4.571428571428571
3147175,4,B0015RCUB4,"I did this DVD for the first time today.  I think the reviews are very accurate and reflect what one will expect during the workout.  There are some distractions that may hinder beginners such as:

* Miscues and miscounts even with the 5-count countdown clock- many times Tom doesnt keep up with the counting and you have to be aware of where you're at until the countdown clock shows up.

* The back-up female workout supporters don't always sync up with Tom so you'll see some going in opposite directions than he is.

* I believe there are different viewpoints that when you, the workout person, are moving in one direction, the camera goes to Tom when he is moving in the opposite direction.

* Background props of a Humvee w/ blinking lights are distracting but one can learn to ignore them

I think Tom is personable but tries too hard to be so. If he would focus on the workout and not schmoozing with the ladies, he'd be fine.

The workout hits the biceps, triceps, shoulders, and legs.  There is no direct chest or back work aside from a little bit of back row combined with a tricept press. You'll need to work these areas after or between sets.  He does offer 3-sets of push-ups for chest/back/tricep work as well as bicycle crunches (I think he goes too fast for one to maintain correct form and increases likelihood that you will strain your next attempting to touch your knees at such a fast pace. Recommend you slow down, keep form and catch up with the workout)

All in all, its a good workout especially if done 3x a week with a goal of minimal weight increase of 1-2% (i.e. 3lb, 5lb, 8lb)  No need for high weights for this workout due to the low-weight/hi-rep focus.  If done twice (warm-up, workout, power blast, workout, cool down) you'll get at least a 100-min workout and it will be worth it.",1214784000,20,1815,4.480243161094225
3147176,5,B0015RCUB4,"This DVD has truly been key to the advancement in my workout routine!
They should bottle Commander Tom up and sell him!!
Oh wait!
They already did!!!
Thanks Commander!!!!!",1211068800,5,171,4.931034482758621
3147177,5,B0015RCUB4,"Wow, this workout is amazing.  It's fun to do and yet 'kills' you at the same time.  The instructor, Tom Stroup, is a real life SWAT team commander and he could get results out of anyone I'm sure.  He's actually got a great personality and makes this workout fun.
You use light dumbells and do lots of repetition to sculpt your whole body.  All the classic moves are included (squats, lateral raises etc) but he does them in different tempos and in different combinations (usually you either work one arm first and then the other, but here you might do your right arm, then left, then work them together).  At the end of the workout there is a bonus 10 minute interval training segment.
It's a more unique workout than any other one I've done for a few reasons; he's outgoing, funny and tough all in one, there is a fantastic set and also the change in pace with the movements keep this fresh for me.  I enjoy this one and highly recommend it.  It may not be for beginners, but almost anyone else can use this and get results.  It's great.",1210636800,32,1039,4.375

This workout packs a punch in a short amount of time.  It's a basic weighted workout with a variety of push ups and bicycles throughout.  You get a total body workout in a short amount of time.  And I couldn't believe how much I felt it with just 5 pound weights.  Tom makes it so much fun you don't realize how hard you're working.

Here's a breakdown of the chapters:

Chapter one- warm up- 11:38 MINUTES
Chapter two- ultimate body definition workout - 20 MINUTES
Chapter three- BONUS- Power Cut Workout- 10 MINUTES
Chapter four- cool down - 5:15 MINUTES

If you're short on time, either the 10 minute or the 20 minute workout can stand alone.  The 10 minute one is a quick drill workout.  The 20 minute one doesn't have an official warm up, but he starts out slowly and it does prepare your body for the workout.  I like to use it before a run.",1208390400,34,992,4.360655737704918

3381657,5,B0015RCUB4,"This is a great cardio workout and a good one to have in the rotation. I would rate it more of an intermediate level than advanced, but it still a very good workout DVD.

3381658,4,B0015RCUB4,"It is 35 minute weight training session, followed by a quick 10 minute cardio session.  The weight training consists of bicep, shoulder, tricep, squats, lunges, and pushup.  The 10 minute cardio can be done immediately following the strength workout, or as quick workout on it own.  It gets the heart pumping, and I think really burns up the calories in conjunction with the first workout.  However if in a bind for time, it would be okay on it own.  Overall, its a quick and effective workout in 35-45 minutes.",1266624000,,511,4.696629213483146
3381659,3,B0015RCUB4,"This video to me was just ok.  I work out a lot and wanted something at home for the days I don't make it to the gym.  It was a decent workout- nothing special.  I guess I get turned off when the instructor is into himself or there are too many heavy chested skinny women.  It is fake and unispiring to me.  I like the workouts where real people are working out like the rest of us and have real bodies, then I believe it is attainable in a $7 video and not in a $5000 dollar surgery.",1265673600,2,484,3.8979591836734695

There aren't tons of reps and the weight part isn't as challenging as some other DVDs-but it's only a half hour and they seem to hit most of the major muscles.
Commander Tom also offers up tips on good form, which is helpful.
For a quick weight session, I like this DVD a lot.  If I want one that's longer with more reps and more muscles, I just use a different one.
This is a good DVD! Don't overlook it!",1263859200,,597,4.008403361344538
3381662,1,B0015RCUB4,"I have read the reveiws for this dvd, and most are very good. I am one of the few that are giving it a low rating. I have done a mouth of the insanity workout with Shaun t and a few of the charlean extreme workouts. This workout doesn t even come in the ballpark of those workouts. This is a good program  for people just above 'beginners"" A total body workout??? COME ON Your biggest muscle group in your upper body , is your back and chest. So you should spend more time and lift heavier weights in these areas. yet you work your bi s and tri s the most and use the same weight for tricept kickbacks as you do for one arm rows. Your biggest upperbody muscle group gets a little to no work. If you think this workout is advanced...do one of Shaun Ts insanity s workout, now thats advanced. Again good for medium fitness levels.

He calls it ""curls for the girls"", then does a sick-looking wink.  Ugh! To think he's around a group of women with no other man in sight, it's distasteful. I shudder and squirm whenever I get to this point, shake it off, then move on. Not sure though how many more times I can go through it.",1241395200,,467,4.2727272727272725

3381668,3,B0015RCUB4,"I have to say that this video is very effective.  You will feel the difference and the burn when you are consistant with both of the SWAT Workouts.  In the warm-up, I thought it went a little slow.  I just didn't feel quite as motivated with the SWAT workout as I have with other workouts.  Not to say that this is not a good video to use as I do alternate it with my other videos for variety.  You will sweat and you will feel better after each of the SWAT workouts.  But if you want motivation and excitement, you might want to try a different route.",1227571200,,552,4.11214953271028
3381669,5,B0015RCUB4,"It matters not whether you want to gradually get in shape or are already VERY pumped up...this will be a staple in your workout library. Not only is the instructor brilliant (in both S.W.A.T videos I have) at working muscles other dvds just don't seem to reach (he calls it a workout from your ears to your toes and he's right...it works every muscle..o.k., not really your ears or toes!...I workout daily but I'll feel his workout the next day in those places other videos don't get)
He's funny and outgoing and an amazing instructor...rare find in a workout video but it sure makes it go faster when it's enjoyable!  You'll learn how to do every move RIGHT. He is great at explaining form.  Just starting out? Use lighter weights...

This is the best strength training video I have ever found. It will change and firm your body RAPIDLY.

To get cardio and strength in one mega workout, try his other SWAT fat burning workout.

Combine the two and you really need no other video!

I have over 100 workout dvds...it's my favorite form of working out and he remains my favorite instructor. Nothing ""put on"" no ""fake toughness""...he's good at instruction, a great workout, but also entertaining to listed to repeatedly.

The set and the rest of the crew round out just a great dvd. I continue to check for a new release and hope we see one soon.",1227139200,6,1343,4.570833333333334

3381671,5,B0015RCUB4,"This and the Extreme Weight Loss and Fat Burning are by far my favorite workouts! For an intense training day, I combine both workouts for a serious cardio and toning regiment, and I can honestly say that (even though it's challenging) I WANT to do it! There are few workouts out there that I look forward to doing! Commander Tom is so great! His direction is clear and motivating, and he knows exactly how to train you so that you stay focused and strong, and really utilize all areas for a whole-body experience. My endurance, body tone, and stamina have increased tremendously since I've done the workouts. I use lighter weights (5-8 lbs) since there are lots of repetitions, but the idea is to keep the body moving, steadily raising and lowering the heart-rate, keeping the blood pumping so that your heart and lungs are working at the optimal levels. Commander Tom says that in doing these workouts he wants us to feel that we're in the best shape of our lives, and I can truly say I'm getting there! Everyday I do it, I feel stronger and happier!",1221091200,2,1052,4.571428571428571
3381672,4,B0015RCUB4,"I did this DVD for the first time today.  I think the reviews are very accurate and reflect what one will expect during the workout.  There are some distractions that may hinder beginners such as:

* Miscues and miscounts even with the 5-count countdown clock- many times Tom doesnt keep up with the counting and you have to be aware of where you're at until the countdown clock shows up.

* The back-up female workout supporters don't always sync up with Tom so you'll see some going in opposite directions than he is.

* I believe there are different viewpoints that when you, the workout person, are moving in one direction, the camera goes to Tom when he is moving in the opposite direction.

* Background props of a Humvee w/ blinking lights are distracting but one can learn to ignore them

I think Tom is personable but tries too hard to be so. If he would focus on the workout and not schmoozing with the ladies, he'd be fine.

The workout hits the biceps, triceps, shoulders, and legs.  There is no direct chest or back work aside from a little bit of back row combined with a tricept press. You'll need to work these areas after or between sets.  He does offer 3-sets of push-ups for chest/back/tricep work as well as bicycle crunches (I think he goes too fast for one to maintain correct form and increases likelihood that you will strain your next attempting to touch your knees at such a fast pace. Recommend you slow down, keep form and catch up with the workout)

All in all, its a good workout especially if done 3x a week with a goal of minimal weight increase of 1-2% (i.e. 3lb, 5lb, 8lb)  No need for high weights for this workout due to the low-weight/hi-rep focus.  If done twice (warm-up, workout, power blast, workout, cool down) you'll get at least a 100-min workout and it will be worth it.",1214784000,20,1815,4.480243161094225

3381674,5,B0015RCUB4,"Wow, this workout is amazing.  It's fun to do and yet 'kills' you at the same time.  The instructor, Tom Stroup, is a real life SWAT team commander and he could get results out of anyone I'm sure.  He's actually got a great personality and makes this workout fun.
You use light dumbells and do lots of repetition to sculpt your whole body.  All the classic moves are included (squats, lateral raises etc) but he does them in different tempos and in different combinations (usually you either work one arm first and then the other, but here you might do your right arm, then left, then work them together).  At the end of the workout there is a bonus 10 minute interval training segment.
It's a more unique workout than any other one I've done for a few reasons; he's outgoing, funny and tough all in one, there is a fantastic set and also the change in pace with the movements keep this fresh for me.  I enjoy this one and highly recommend it.  It may not be for beginners, but almost anyone else can use this and get results.  It's great.",1210636800,32,1039,4.375

3381678,5,B0015RCUB4,"The SWAT Workout is led by Tom Stroup, an actual SWAT commander.  He has a great personality and a good rapport with the background exercisers.  This workout packs a punch in a short amount of time.  It's a basic weighted workout with a variety of push ups and bicycles throughout.  You get a total body workout in a short amount of time.  And I couldn't believe how much I felt it with just 5 pound weights.  Tom makes it so much fun you don't realize how hard you're working.

Here's a breakdown of the chapters:

Chapter one- warm up- 11:38 MINUTES
Chapter two- ultimate body definition workout - 20 MINUTES
Chapter three- BONUS- Power Cut Workout- 10 MINUTES
Chapter four- cool down - 5:15 MINUTES

If you're short on time, either the 10 minute or the 20 minute workout can stand alone.  The 10 minute one is a quick drill workout.  The 20 minute one doesn't have an official warm up, but he starts out slowly and it does prepare your body for the workout.  I like to use it before a run.",1208390400,34,992,4.360655737704918
