4047433,5,B0030Y120K,It is so wonderful this day in time to be able to laugh at the antics of an extreamly talented comic icon!!! My husband has been recently diagnosed with an advanced brain tumor and we really enjoy being able to sit down together and spend some very important time together laughing at good clean humor. They say laughter is the best medicine and Red Skelton is one of the best! We also got the entire I Love Lucy series and are enjoying it as well!!,1317081600,3,449,4.294117647058823
4047434,3,B0030Y120K,"having suffered through many red DVDs that were hardly watchable,i have to ask the question that no one has answered,is this set remastered or restored?if not,why bother?",1304467200,6,170,5.333333333333333
4047435,5,B0030Y120K,Enjoyed these shows. Perfect for the whole family. This is a great way to spend an evening together. It is so different than anything out there now.,1301011200,3,148,4.518518518518518
4047436,5,B0030Y120K,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who has loved Red Skelton since childhood.  He had no other DVD's of him.  This covered everything this very talented man did..all his impersonations, plus there is a bonus concert that is really funny.  Well worth it!!!!!!!",1290816000,26,265,4.717391304347826
4047437,5,B0030Y120K,It was great being able to watch Red Skelton after so many years. Every Tuesday when I was a child was spent in front of the old black and white TV  watching this comic who was as truthful with his jokes as any satirist just funnier. It was and is a pleasure to show this old show with other deceased stars to my kids and their kids. He was one of a kind. Good night and may God bless.,1289088000,23,385,3.8734177215189876
4047438,5,B0030Y120K,"Here is a description I found on another website that I pasted below. It sounds like this set is the Red Skelton Unreleased series with bonus unreleased episodes - only available at greater prices, plus compilations previously seen on PBS. I would buy it but this company keeps re-releasing estate authorized episodes under a multitude of different packages. But, I would say its a great buy for someone new to Red's humor. I'm holding out for the bio dvd to be released separately...

Among America's great comedians, Red Skelton is certainly the most beloved, along with his gallery of characters, including Clem Kadiddlehopper, San Fernando Red, and of course, Freddie the Freeloader. Red Skelton entertained us with his charm, wit and warmth for decades, on stage, on radio, in the movies, and on his hit television program. Movie and television stars lined up to appear on his television show, week after week, year after year, entertaining us and themselves in funny skits with Red. This 18 DVD boxed set brings you over 33 hours of Red's unique brand of comedy, including: ""Red Skelton Unreleased"" - 40 rare, classic shows from the black and white version of ""The Red Skelton Show"", with special guest stars Danny Thomas, Sebastian Cabot, Amanda Blake, Jackie Gleason, Peter Lorre, and many, many more; ""Red Skelton In Color"" - ""The Red Skelton Show"" in color. 23 color shows featuring guest stars, Michael Landon, Telly Savalas, Jill St. John, Jerry Lewis, Mike Connors and more!; ""The Best Of Red Skelton"" - A one hour selection of Red's skits in color; ""Pantomimes"" - The best of Red's wordless, priceless pantomimes; ""Red Skelton: America's Clown"" - An intimate biography of Red Skelton; ""Getting Personal"" - A very special interview with Red Skelton; ""Live In Sparks Nevada"" - Red's unedited night club performance at the Nuggett Hotel; and ""The Pledge Of Allegiance"" - As only Red, a unique American patriot, could recite it.",1267488000,32,1938,5.0
4047449,5,B0030Y120K,"Red Skelton's is timeless as his humor is clean and family friendly. Some of the jokes might need some explanation for the younger folk as Skelton does mention things like ""Car 54 where are you"" in his skits. Most of his comedy though will be understood and enjoyed by almost all TV viewers.

4047508,3,B0030Y120K,"I bought this set for about a third of the listed price for that it is worth it but for the listed price you should consider a few things before you buy.
The shows are not restored in any way. The B/W shows have about the same quality as public domain DVDs.
More disturbing is the B/W shows tend to only have about 22 minutes of content which means 3 minutes of non-commercial content are missing from these shows. And one of the B/W shows was aired when Red was out sick so the entire show consists of Arthur Godfrey interviewing Jackie Gleason. Interesting but why includ a Skelton show that Red was not on. The 23 color shows have better picture quality. These shows comprise the last season of the Skelton show after CBS cancelled Red and NBC picked up the show for one more season.
Also as mentioned in an earlier review all 18 discs have been released in other various box sets so if you have any of them I would stay away from this set.",1322784000,36,943,4.273743016759776

Its always great when the actors say anothers line in mistake and they have to ad-lib to get the story back on track. And sometimes the lines crack up the cast. Thats what you will see on these episodes.

Reds guests who were leading men in the movies show you their versatile talents. After you see these programs, youll be aware of how much talent has been lost. Today, good-looking actors and actresses spout lines in a monotone and the special effects dominate the storyline. Character rarely is the focus anymore.",1440028800,2,669,4.817391304347826
