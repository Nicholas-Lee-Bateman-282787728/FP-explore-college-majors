2577209,4,B000FNNHZC,"Lewis isn't Morse...but then no one is.  Nonetheless, it's still worthwhile to see an older, more somber (he's widowed now) Lewis at work.  It's interesting to see him interact with his sergeant, to see what is or isn't done the same as when he was buying Morse pints of ale.  Definitely worth a look.  Will it become a series?  Hope so.",1163116800,5,337,4.459016393442623
2577210,5,B000FNNHZC,"I watched this episode eagerly, yet somewhat appreshensively--but was delighted with the way Lewis had gained in his professional insights, while retaining his personality from the earlier Morse series. Morse having been the academic foil from whom Lewis learned (and who learned from Lewis), the introduction of a young academic as Lewis' suborindate was a brilliant stroke---as well as that of giving the younger man a theological background, even as Lewis struggles with his own loss of  faith. (Indeed, a point of fine-tuned accuracy: the assistant is from Cambridge University, Oxford's rival and historically somewhat more sympathetic to traditional Christian theology).

I must agree with the reviewer who thought this episode rather more rushed than those that starred John Thaw. A few things did seem thrown in at the last moment. But how wonderful to see all the old Oxford sites, including (I believe) the Trout Inn at the end of the episode. Having once applied for doctoral studies there (Oxford, not the Trout, though I'm sure the two would become intertwined), I must confess that it was fantasatic to see the ""city of dreaming spires"" again! I sincerely hope there are many more episodes to come! (I would gladly volunteer as an ""extra"" on the set if they need a pseudo-academic with mild cerebral palsy!)",1155254400,101,1321,5.111111111111111
2577211,4,B000FNNHZC,"From 1987-2000, mystery lovers across the world immersed themselves in the television adventures of Inspector Endeavour Morse and his sidekick, Sgt. Robbie Lewis. They solved intricate crimes, all the while taking-in the beautiful scenery of the city of Oxford and the surrounding countryside. Then, Colin Dexter, the author of the Morse novels that the series was based on, decided to kill-off his signature character, and the television series followed suit. Even more sad was the passing of John Thaw, the talented actor who portrayed Inspector Morse, just two years after the series ended.

Enter Kevin Whately in 2005. Whately played Sgt. Lewis alongside Thaw's Morse for the entire series (minus one episode), and has returned to the colleges and dreaming spires of Oxford once more in a show of his own, aptly titled ""Inspector Lewis."" It's five years since Morse's death, and much has changed in Lewis's life. His wife passed away in a car accident, he lost his faith, saw his kids grow up and move out, and has just returned from an assignment abroad. When his new partner asks if Oxford has changed much during his absence, Lewis wearily replies, ""It changed before I left.""

There is a new superintendent running the Oxford police, and she does not take to Lewis immediately. Morse's old sidekick is given a new assistant in the form of DS Hathaway, a younger man who used to attend divinity school. He is keenly intelligent, has a quiet strength, and is played well by actor Laurence Fox. Lewis and Hathaway are assigned to investigate the murder of student Regan Peverill, shot while she was a patient at a sleep clinic. The suspects range from a disturbed male student who may or may not have been sleeping with the deceased, the father of the disturbed student, an egotistical professor, the manager of the sleep clinic, and a plethora of other suspicious characters.

""Inspector Lewis"" retains many of the traditional elements of the preceding ""Inspector Morse"" series, and references the character of Morse quite a bit. There are references to Hamlet, the city of Oxford is featured prominently, and fans of the old show will appreciate the inclusion of Clare Holman as Dr. Laura Hobson. The unraveling of the crime is, I suppose, satisfactory, although the pacing of the story felt faster than a typical Morse story of old. If you're not familiar with the character of Robbie Lewis, then this is a great place to start. He stands on his own quite well.  There is, however, a pervasive sense of sadness that encompasses ""Inspector Lewis,"" as the past makes way for the future.

2577212,4,B000FNNHZC,"""Inspector Lewis"" is the successor to the immensely popular ""Inspector Morse"" detective series that featured the reclusive, erudite, Oxford Detective Chief Inspector Morse, created by novelist Colin Dexter, and his younger working-class partner Detective Sergeant Lewis. ""Inspector Morse"" began in 1987 and ran 33 episodes until Morse's death in 2000. ""Inspector Lewis"" picks up when DI Lewis returns from a 2-year assignment in the Virgin Islands. A lot has happened in the 5 years since Morse's death. Three years ago, Lewis lost his wife to an unsolved hit-and-run accident. This left him bitter and apparently unsuitable for duties in Oxford, so Lewis was transferred to the Virgin Islands. Now his new, temporary partner Detective Sergeant James Hathaway asks, ""Has Oxford changed much since you've been away?"" Lewis replies, ""Nope. It changed before I left.""

Regan Peverill (Sophie Winkleman), a mathematics student at Oxford University, is shot to death while volunteering at a Sleep Laboratory. Her classmate Daniel Griffon (Charlie Cox) apparently entered the building with his unique key code just before the shooting and has lost a gun from his dorm room, making Danny the prime suspect. DCS Innocent (Rebecca Frost) reluctantly allows DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) to head the investigation until he can be replaced. Although the DCS discourages ""speculating unnecessarily"", Lewis and DS Hathaway (Laurence Fox) doubt that the case is as cut and dried as it seems. Danny's family owns the luxury auto company Griffin Motors, and he is set to inherit controlling interest when he turns 21. Since his father's death. the company has been under the control of Danny's uncle Rex Griffon (Jack Ellis), mother Trudie (Jemma Redgrave), and finance director Tom Pollock (Danny Webb). Danny is an unstable young man obsessed with the idea that his uncle murdered his father. Professor Denniston (Michael Maloney) was tutoring Danny the night of the murder and provides his alibi. But more murders are in store. And Professor Denniston's clock is wrong.

""Inspector Lewis"" tries to recapture the formula that was part of ""Inspector Morse""'s great success, and it does a pretty good job. Lewis is still the ordinary guy. His younger partner Hathaway is a more educated former seminary student who was booted out of school for reasons unknown. The interplay between them recalls the relationship of Morse and Lewis: An Everyman and an Oxbridge-educated detective with very different, complimentary perspectives. Now Lewis is the world-weary partner, and he's atheistic, in contrast to Hathaway's religious background. So Lewis has taken on the Morse role in some respects and retained his old working-class identity in others. The recipe might sound stale and contrived, but Lewis is still a likeable character and Hathaway is sharp and intriguing. ""Inspector Lewis"" has a characteristic Greek Tragedy bent: Old family secrets and contemporary character flaws combine with tragic consequences. This Lewis mystery comes off as well as the later Morse mysteries.",1154390400,68,3056,5.377870563674321

In regards to the ""Inspector Lewis"" series, I am absolutely thrilled with the writing, the acting and the direction. Kevin Whately is carrying the lead brilliantly. The Lewis character reflects grief and shows strength in solving the mysteries in his way. Laurence Fox (as Lewis' DS sidekick) presents an exciting new character and develops a complimentary relationship with Lewis.  I now have a collection of all available ""Inspector Lewis"" series and eagerly await each available season.

2577216,5,B000FNNHZC,"""Inspector Lewis"" (2005) is a fairly good substitute for the old Inspector Morse series although I dearly miss in books and television the irreplaceable, eccentric, irascible Morse. Lewis (well-played by Kevin Whately) will never be as interesting and quirky a character as his old boss, but this first episode in a new series is very good. Even though it lacks the humor and wit of the Morse series, it is well done. Lewis is back as an inspector; Morse has been dead for five years, and Lewis is still grieving over the death of his wife in a hit-and-run.
He has a dogsbody sergeant, a bag man now, the tall very bright, crossword-puzzle loving, ex-theologian Sergeant Hathaway (Laurence Fox). Lewis's boss is a woman who doesn't think of much of him and wants to put him out to pasture, that is until he proves he's as good as his old boss at solving murders. There are three homicides in this one, and the plot is as complicated, labyrinthine, and convoluted as in the usual Morse outings.
The scion of a car-making empire, Daniel Griffon, is a bright Oxford math student who goes to a sleep disorder clinic along with other students. They are wired up and studied for various sleep maladies. The head of the lab is very attractive, and there may be some future love interest between Lewis and the scientist. He's a widower and she's single.
The screenwriter has put good chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway, and even though Hathaway is quite cerebral, Lewis seems to be much more astute on his own without the Morse genius breathing down his back. Hathaway is a good, but humorless character creation. It would be fun to team up Lewis with a Benny Hill type of character. Mysteries should be fun too. Inspector Gently has a confrontational, rather dodgy sergeant, and Inspector Foyle has two interesting assistants. In this one watch out for all those suspects running around in hoodies like homeboys.
There are plenty of suspects, but as usual they have so many issues and there are so many cross-currents that the viewer is going to be in the dark most of the time.
The photography is excellent, and the scenes of Oxford, the backs, the college quads and buildings like the Bodleian are stunning. We'd like a little more fun and witty by-play between inspector and sergeant, but there will never be another Morse.
At this writing Colin Dexter (born 1930) is still alive, but Inspector Morse's interpreter, actor, John Thaw passed in 2002 at age sixty.",1285459200,,2459,4.747663551401869

2577218,5,B000FNNHZC,"Kevin Whately, formerly of the ""Inspector Morse"" series, returns to Oxford as Inspector Robbie Lewis, just back from a tour in the British Virgin Islands and still mourning the death of his wife in a hit and run incident, in the pilot episode of ""Inspector Lewis"".  This Brit mystery is now into its second season but the pilot sets the tone for a highly enjoyable show.

Lewis is just off the plane and still in a colorful islands shirt when he is pulled into the investigation of the murder of an American student.  Paired off with young Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), Lewis tracks the clues to another student, heir to an automobile family with far too many secrets.  As the bodies stack up, Lewis is under the additional pressure of avoiding an unwanted school-house assignment from his new and skeptical boss, Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent.

Lewis and Hathaway will solve the case through a combination of high tech and old-fashioned sleuthing, with an intriguing assist, a clue left by Lewis' mentor Inspector Morse.  In the process, the rough and ready Lewis will begin to build a dynamic partnership with the well-educated Hathaway, a former seminarian.  ""Inspector Lewis: The Pilot"" is very highly recommended to fans of Masterpiece Mystery and the Inspector Lewis series.",1256342400,,1305,5.0418604651162795

It is great to see them hand off the story and depth of character to Robbie Lewis, and they did it so well.  Kevin Whatley does a fantastic job of covering the range of emotions that his character has gone through.  And all of the characters in the movie are memorable.

2577220,3,B000FNNHZC,The second banana takes center stage in this agreeable return to Oxford.  He's by no means as compelling a character as Morse (nor is the actor in John Thaw's league) but most anyone will end up rooting for both.,1234569600,,212,4.435897435897436

2577222,5,B000FNNHZC,"Whatley did a magnificent job re-creating the character of Lewis.  He maintained the personality of the character while developing some more depth to it.  This Lewis is more determined than the one in the Morse episodes.  It even seem like a little of Morse has rubbed off on Lewis, which is both surprising and refreshing.  I like the new sargent Hathaway as well, he compliments Lewis like Lewis did Morse.

Well Done!  I look forward to the rest of the series as it comes out",1207094400,6,478,4.564705882352941
2577223,3,B000FNNHZC,"I would like to give this series a chance before I decide what I think of it. I was never that impressed with Inspector Morris (sorry!) but I kinda got into this. Here's my problem: There were 4 episodes in the 1st season and only the 1st episode was released in the U.S. which hardly gives it a fair chance. Release the full season, or, really go out on a limb and release the 2nd season too. ""Inspector Morris"" had 33 episodes is it asking too much to see a meager 4 of ""Inspector Lewis""?",1203465600,7,490,4.168421052631579
2577224,2,B000FNNHZC,"There's a good reason why Whatley was a sidekick to Thaw -- as an actor, he doesn't have the presence, resourcefulness, and worldly charm of the old man. Throughout the four episodes in the box, Whatley is desperately trying to find an identity, a persona. For the most part, he resorts to stock attitudes and personality traits (the grouch, working-class cynicism, a disgruntled widower, or a fumbling combination of these). Whatever he chooses, Whatley cannot appropriate the character, make it his own -- the lines take over and he becomes as flat as the pages they were written on. Any worse, and he'd be reciting his way through the series.

Sorry, but Lewis is just not up to being Inspector in a series of such high repute. If you need a specific example, check out the first episode, where Lewis's sidekick Hathaway (not much of character to begin with) steals the show completely, even taking over the plot! Thereafter, we see Whatley trying on different hats, changing character with every new investigation. You have it all wrong Whatley -- you make the hat yourself!

As for the storylines, well, I never thought anything related to Morse would drag, but these cases meander, nearly reaching a standstill in the middle of a couple of episodes. And then you have the remaining characters, the Superintendent and the Pathologist, both cookie-cut with the same languishing creativity. In fact, Inspector Lewis is beginning to remind me of dreadful and crude productions like McBride on Hallmark channel (god forbid!).

A shame that Morse should have to end this way.",1201046400,3,1575,4.958333333333333
2577225,5,B000FNNHZC,"Just wanted to let all the Morse and Lewis fans know that a short series (4 episodes in addition to the pilot selling here) of Lewis was broadcast in the UK in 2007. Why it apparently hasn't been shown in the US is a mystery (no pun intended). You've got three options: (1) move to the UK; (2) start a letter-writing campaign to PBS to show them; (3) buy a multi-region DVD player from Amazon.com and buy the series from Amazon.co.uk. If you pick the last option, you can also then see other great UK productions like Life on Mars.",1199664000,13,531,4.32
2577226,3,B000FNNHZC,"I hate saying it, but I will anyway. Lewis has not been able to live up to the expectations of his teacher, Morse. Unfortunately, that basic comparison will always be there... much as I hate making that comparison. It is very evident that the creators of this series have done everything possible to recreate the Morse magic including a classical background score, the same Oxford environs etc. But Morse was Morse. Lewis is not. He doesn't have that air of superiority that Morse had. I still associate him with being DS Lewis not DCI Lewis. I know that's unfair, but that's the honest truth.",1194652800,4,593,4.711538461538462

It is fitting that Inspector Morse's long shadow haunt this first case in which Inspector Lewis returns to Oxford. I can only hope that the great writing and enthusiastic acting that characterised the original series will give new and legitimate life to this new one. I never tired of Morse's stories and if subsequent episodes continue in the searching and clever twists and turns of the original ones, I will become an undying fan to the point of creating Lewis' own website ([...]).

I unreservedly recommend this Hamlet-esque episode to all Morse fans.

In fact, be prepared to feel Morse's presence all the way through, in a believable, poignant way.

2577230,4,B000FNNHZC,"This is a fine continuation of the Inspector Morse series. This review is not a critique of the story but this annoyingly cut DVD. Instead of recording the episodes straight onto DVD, as was done with the Inspector Morse series, the mistake has been made of recording the US-aired version from PBS' Mystery. None of the story has been omitted, but one has to endure the tedious PBS Mystery introduction, which has no chapter break to separate it, and we don't hear the originally composed music ending the show. This kind of thing is hugely unnecessary. Fans don't want the PBS Mystery interruptions and rushed editing (perhaps an attempt to advertize PBS' show to Inspector Lewis fans), but just the show itself with all the little touches, including the appropriate fade into the end theme music.

Anybody who was a fan of Morse surely must be interested in the career and life of Morse's long-suffering assistant.  This is the promotion Lewis and Kevin Whately deserve -- the leading detective, the star of the show.  This mystery is absolutely up to the standard set by Morse, a series I was sorry to see end.  Lewis' assistant here is the more intellectual and educated of the two men, whereas Morse was the more sophisticated man in the prior series.  Lewis, however, is a clever man; and where cleverness leaves off, hard work and determination take over.  Actually, Lewis is more sympathetic than Morse and more approachable.

2577234,5,B000FNNHZC,"Inspector Robbie Lewis arrives at the Oxford Police Department to a whole new regime when he returns to Oxford after three years in the Caribbean.  He has been trying to come to grips with the death of his mentor, Inspector Endeavor Morse (whose series, including specials, ran from 1987 - 2000), and of his wife Valerie, in a London hit-and-run accident.  The Chief Superintendent is now Jean Innocent, an abrupt woman who immediately assigns Lewis to a senior training post, though he wants to get back into action.  Reluctantly, she allows him to manage a new murder case, but only for three days.

A young math student has been shot in the head at close range while at an Oxford sleep lab to which only a few people have access.  The suspect is Danny Griffon, a disturbed but brilliant fellow-student, and the heir to a sports car company which the Japanese are in the process of buying. Lewis (Kevin Whately) and his partner, James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), a former seminarian, investigate this death and several others which occur within the next few days.

Those who loved the Inspector Morse series and who mourned not only the death of Morse, in the final episode, but also of actor John Thaw, in 2002, will be delighted by this spin-off, which gives Morse's sidekick his own series.  Actor Kevin Whately continues his self-effacing role, but he also conveys a sense of competence, and his relationship with Hathaway reminds one of Morse's relationship with Lewis.  Whately has obviously aged in the seven years since the end of the Morse series, and this serves him in good stead here, providing a sense of gravitas.

The wonderfully intricate plot to this pilot, as good as the best of the Morse series, keeps the viewer totally involved, and the occasional references to Morse, including a poignant visual reminder via a crossword puzzle which retains the outline of his coffee cup, add to the sense of continuity.  The photography is outstanding, though not as dramatic here as it was in the Morse series, and Barrington Pheloung, who did the brilliant music for the Morse series, returns for this series.  In England, this pilot was followed by three more episodes in February and March, 2007, and one can only hope these will be made available soon to those of us who long for more of the clever mysteries and wonderful characters we enjoyed with the Morse series.  n  Mary Whipple",1183075200,20,2396,4.800486618004866
2577235,4,B000FNNHZC,"I didn't even know there had been an ""Inspector Lewis"" story out until I saw it mentioned in a mail order catalog I get. Amazon had a much better price so I bought my copy here just based on the old Morse stories I'd seen.

Kevin Whately, as Inspector Lewis, might be a smarter man than the old character but he does a good job and I certainly love seeing Oxford again. One or more other reviews write about a different pacing to the show- I didn't really notice that. I did like the way several false leads were given to the viewer, you really have to pay attention to the story.

I saw several links to the old Morse stories starting when the jetlagged Inspector Lewis is almost run down by a Jaguar of the same model and similar color to the car Inspector Morse used to drive, some I didn't pick up on until a day or so later after a llittle thought.

The show is very well done and I'll watch more episodes if PBS ever gets more of them (I think season 1 of the Inspector Lewis series is now out at AmazonUK- if it isn't it will be soon, you'll need something that can play region 2 PAL format to watch those)and I'll buy them somewhere even if there isn't a U.S. market copy available.",1175904000,5,1190,4.165217391304348
2577236,5,B000FNNHZC,"This show is extremely well-written and should not be missed by any fan of Morse. I put off watching this for a month because I thought it would be depressing - Morse dead, Inspector Lewis widowed, and now he's been promoted. Would he be turned into a brooding sort of person, or perhaps another Morse? Would the sidekick take on the personality of Lewis? Would they bumble along without leadership? Would it be a sad farce of the Morse series?

Well, not to worry - it is WONDERFUL. They were true to the original characters, with a couple of new ones added that bring forth all sorts of future possibilities. The sidekick is absolutely perfect - intriguing, intelligent, subtle, and with a very understated but devastating wit. As for Lewis, even though he's mourning his departed wife, he never strays from the fundamentally optimistic character that we know and love. He's older, more mature, still wounded, but not bitter.

The subtle references to Morse are delightful: the anonymuosly funded ""Endeavor"" scholarship, the comment about no one knowing the first name of Morse (ah, but Robbie Lewis actually does, and so do you, if you've watched the one Morse episode where Lewis overheard Morse reveal it), the old crossword filled in by Morse with cryptic comments, the references to Hamlet, the ring of stain from a Morse beer glass, and the sidekick banging on the window of Lewis' house to awaken him. The mystery part is well up to the Morse standard; the characters are very three-dimensional; and the scenery is as gorgeous as ever.

I hope they make more like this one, and I hope they keep the same great combination of writers, actors, and all the rest. You can really tell that this is a winning team, right out of the gate.",1170720000,14,1740,4.735973597359736

2577240,5,B000FNNHZC,"I am a British television police mystery genre junkie.  One of the most legendary was the ""Inspector Morse"" series starring the late, great John Thaw.  Morse (remember no first name) was the Oxford educated Detective Chief Inspector who did not fit nicely into the workaday world of policing.  His intellectual approach to crime solution and love of good ale and beer did not always set well with his superiors.  Morse could be compared to Don Quixote...tilting, in his idealistic way, at the windmills of crime in Oxford.  Enter Detective Sergeant Lewis (played impeccably by Kevin Whatley) the working class, ethical family man who was often the foil (Sancho Panza) for the single, unlucky at love, Morse.  Sadly, Morse dies and Lewis is promoted to Inspector.  The subject of my comments is the production entitled ""Inspector Lewis,"" where the protaganist is joined returning to the Thames Valley Police (responsible for policing Oxford) from an overseas posting.  In my opinion, this production does portray the reality of policing.  Inspector Lewis is not a super sleuth, but a fallible police officer undertaking a difficult investigation.  Added to this is the political meddling of superior officers with their own agenda...how real.  Kevin Whatley is a fine British actor portraying a likeable copper.  He is again paired up with an OxBridge type to assist him with his inquiries.  I wish more ""Inspector Lewis"" episodes were forthcoming.",1167782400,5,1447,5.212121212121212

2577242,5,B000FNNHZC,"Every now and then we sould honor the memory of Morse and John Thaw. Inspector Lewis does that plus it brings some closure to the other key character. So the author of this screen play is no Colin Dexter and reverted to remaking Hamlet - at least it is admitted in the dialog itself. Very predictable plot twists and well crafted ending. All in all, 5 stars if you're into Morse. Skip it if you aren't.",1167782400,3,402,4.302631578947368
2577243,5,B000FNNHZC,"I guess this DVD could be considered a ""follow-up"" to ""Morse"" I don't necessarily think that it really is.  Lewis, as ""Inspector Morse's"" sidekick, to me, has always stood on his own as a detective and this presentation proves that he is one darn good detective,  I hope that this a beginning of a series with more episodes yet to come.

I really (and always have) liked Kevin Whatley as Inspector Lewis.  This time he is on his own and is, for once, (instead of John Thaw, as Morse) allowed to be kind of cranky and a little befuddled with the ""new"" technology in police work.--he even orders an alcoholic drink and gets to tell his sidekick to have orange juice.  In this presentation, he has a great partner in Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, as played very well by Laurence Fox.  They are really a good team with Hathaway guiding Lewis through the maze of the ""new"" technology in police work.

This is really a good mystery--complicated enough to keep one awake and with enough twists and turns to keep one guessing ""who done it?""

I really enjoyed this presentation--I WANT more Inspector Lewis.",1164585600,8,1103,4.649484536082475

Middle class Inspector Robbie Lewis accompanied by Sgt Hathaway educated at Cambridge originally for the priesthood, look into the sleep lab murder of a mathematically gifted student pursuing the Goldbach conjecture on Perfect Numbers beyond 10 to the 18th power. Inspector Lewis remains entrapped in grief over his wife's hit and run death 2 years prior: I'm glad they never found him, I'm afraid of what I might do.

To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only end of life. Robert Lewis Stevenson

The ongoing stress of bereavement and town and gown chiaroscuro continues through the 2012 sixth season of a series of which ""Inspector Lewis"" is the pilot episode. Flirtatious Dr Hobson forensic pathologist and bureaucrat Superintendent Innocent are ongoing characters in the series.

Sorrow makes us all children again. Ralph Waldo Emerson

Inspector Lewis is distinguished by common sense despite being a techno-dinosaur with insensitivity to flirting. Sgt Hathaway's Cambridge education offers some assistance in investigating Oxford murders which occur with frightening regularity on campus. However Sgt Hathaway is hampered by a Cambridge vs an Oxford education, the latter which might benefit him with the ability to read ancient Greek (JK Rowling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-The-Complete-8-Film-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B005OCFHHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection [Blu-ray</a>], Oxford don TRR Tolkien&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-The-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The-Two-Towers-The-Return-of-the-King-Extended-Editions-Blu-ray/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions) [Blu-ray</a>]).

Suffering is a revelation. One discovers things one never discovered before. Oscar Wilde

In each episode human arrogance, contempt, jealousy, vanity, greed, secrecy, suspicion, insomnia, marijuana, bureaucratic compliance and complacency wrestle with intellectual integrity, restraint, apology, discretion, capacity for forgiveness, growth, acceptance and moving on (books Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness, The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from  Chronic Unhappiness).

Heartbreak is life educating us. George Bernard Shaw

Inspector Lewis' pilot is a marvel compacting the breadth of human challenges: caregiving for Parkinson's spouse (ASIN:0978544803 The Caregiver Helpbook, Powerful Tools for Caregivers, DVDs You Don't Know Jack, How to Die in Oregon), burdens of wealth (Confessions of a Shopaholic) in discerning those grasping at money rather than appreciating the human being, parenting (ASIN:B003LHNSS0 Helicopters, Drill Sergeants, and Consultants Book & CD Set: Parenting Styles & the Messages They Send), suspicion (Hamlet, DVD Danny DeVito ASIN:B00008L3S9 Renaissance Man, documentary ASIN:B000CRR3GA The Hobart Shakespeareans), incest, infidelity, gambling addiction (bridge, betting on animals, boxing, alcohol nicotine, titillation, loneliness, manipulation, irritability, other blaming, borrowing, depression), sculling (bowside vs strokeside, Macons vs Cleavers), race car driving, friendship, social climbing, Russian Roulette, adolescent impulsivity, egotism of believing one's own publicity vs anonymous humility of genuine competence.

We do not receive wisdom. We must discover it for ourselves following a journey through wilderness which no one can make for us and from which none can spare us. For wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. Marcel Proust

Each episode reinforces the message introduced in this first pilot: collegiate impulses return to haunt adulthood (marijuana allergic bronchial spasm asthma, secondhand smoke lung cancer in other family, alcohol drug use impede evolution toward acceptance of personal responsibility for life outcomes [moral blunting], internet indiscretions impact on others including suicide, self indulgent vanity obstructing awareness of harm to others, manipulation, deception). Intellect is separate from and does not protect from mental illness nor create a moral compass, that ability to achieve change by sustaining determined enduring effort even against the grain of intuition, genetic impulse and upbringing ""do I detect a whiff of Papism?""

Enjoyable 90minute murder mysteries, flecked with literary memory and in depth psychology about how misguided we can be though convinced we are absolutely right (if we contemptuously ignore the rights of others) as we pursue self righteous pleasure, ambitions, materialism. And how we fail to notice aging unchecked with Botox, liposuction or body ""work,"" aging scarred into the moral psyche by a lifetime of choices made ""you don't want to die unshriven.""

Even the healing capacity of meditation, art, music, painting, sport and pleasurable intellectual pursuits can be compromised by the cumulative consequences of years of self deceptive abuse (gossip, revenge, vindictiveness, anger, contempt, arrogance, vanity, slander, pedophilia rationalized as ""charity,"" alcohol nicotine marijuana caffeine). Authentic mental health is shaped by ethical restraint uninhabited by pride, blame or self indulgence, with constant attention to awareness, honesty, self examination, expiation.

Bhagavad Gita 6th Century BC: Their love is the same for enemies and friends.

Inspector Lewis' series permits armchair journeys into Dante's Inferno. 5 star pilot for an ongoing current 6th season odyssey from PBS. Semiotic brain teasers with clues imbedded, hidden in unnoticed allusions, quotations and names, like the querulous Professor Quirrell in Harry Potter. Delightful mental exercise.",1345161600,,8102,7.519494204425711
