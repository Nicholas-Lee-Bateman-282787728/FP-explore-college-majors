3698603,4,B001MSC61A,"Well, well, what a fun to watch. Beautiful and very effective stages sets. I am a little surprised it sang in English. But somehow it works.
Papageno is the highlight of this product, which you can tell by the applauses from the audiences. The Queen is also technically brilliant on those high notes. Pamela was doing ok, though I have seeing better.

Somehow, I wish to hear the orchestra in Baroque style as it was original written. But I guess just not with Met orchestra though.

Overall it is a fun opera to watch. Not as fun as the one I played with Opera Ozark though.

I think this opera is perfect to re-version to a smaller production just for the kids. They probably would like it and also educational (ex. like if you lies about things, you get lock on your mouth ;)

Another thing I noticed is they had very 'generous' cut on the overture. Which, I prefer they'd played it all.",1278547200,,890,4.408536585365853
3698604,5,B001MSC61A,"This production of The Magic Flute just plain blew me away!  I've seen six others and this one is by far the best!  The costumes and sets are magical, just what this fantasy opera requires.  The English translation is true to the story and fits the music perfectly.  Further, the diction of all the singers was clear as a bell.

There are no weak links in the cast; all were superb.  But, I particularly loved Nathan Gunn's athletic Papageno and Matthew Polenzani's Tamino.  Erika Miklosa's Queen of the Night was likewise wonderful, including her negotiations of her elaborate costumes.  The only off key notes of the opera were rather endearing, coming from the high notes of the three young boys, called ""spirits"" in this English production.

I think Mozart would love this version.  I know I'll watch this again and again.  This would be a great gift for a Mozart fan.  I recommend it highly.",1267574400,3,896,4.709677419354839
3698605,5,B001MSC61A,Finally an opera I can understand - I've always loved the music but did not understand the play (language barrier). This ENGLISH version is perfect and done of course by the first class Metropolitan Opera.,1267056000,,205,4.885714285714286
3698606,5,B001MSC61A,"A stunning performance. I had seen a school production of the English version and encountered this one on TV. When I saw this for the first time, I was enchanted, enthralled, etc.

The costuming is very colorful and very original. The performance was first-rate. My grandchildren found the performance by Nathan Gunn amusing. Since the first time, I have seen this at least five times, reflecting how much I enjoy this production.

The Met has done it again!",1262822400,8,458,4.858974358974359

3698608,4,B001MSC61A,"I thought this was a good presentation of the opera, with good, but not great singing.  My high school students were a bit distracted by the costumes and setting which they characterized as ""weird"".  It is a more modern presentation with a strong Asian influence.  If you are going to show this to students, I found that they paid good attention and followed the story.  The music does not seem to just pop out at me, or them.",1257033600,4,426,4.423076923076923

3698611,5,B001MSC61A,"First, let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of this production. I saw it live at the Met at the premier performance and was absolutely thrilled. This very fresh, imaginative staging brings this extraordinary Mozart masterpiece to life.

As an elementary school music educator, I have used this HD performance in the classroom as an introduction to the genre. We spend a few classes studying the story and discussing what opera is so that the students understand everything, and then show the film. They absolutely love it! With top-notch artistry, it is an invaluable resource.

It is important to note that this is a cut version of the opera sung in English. If you're looking for the original sung in German, this is not the item for you.",1237593600,103,747,4.651515151515151
3698612,4,B001MSC61A,"This is the much anticipated release of the first HD broadcast by the Met from 2 years ago.  I saw it in the theater and was overwhelmed by the spectacular effects and, although I am not a big fan of abridged works as well as works not done in the original language, these concerns were dispelled by this production.  It continues to play well on second and third viewings-something I cannot say for all video opera productions.  With the exception of Rene Pape, none of the principal performers are operatic household names although, Nathan Gunn, a relative newcomer, steals the show as Papageno. Close seconds are Greg Fedderly (Monostatos) and Jennifer Aylmer (Papagena).
While the whole show is largely enjoyable, there are some caveats for diehard opera fans.  The principal female roles of Pamina and Queen of the Night are somewhat disappointing both in their characterization and delivery of their big arias. Matthew Polezani (Tamino) is not a very interesting performer in this production; his stiffness in this role is in sharp contrast to the dynamic performance of Nathan Gunn.
The surround soundtrack lacks ambience and crispness.
These caveats aside, I think that most viewers will enjoy this version for its showmanship, humor (it is after all a comic opera), and visual impact.",1230336000,62,1293,5.056338028169014

Chances are good you'll walk into the room and the youngster will be sitting down watching the Met's fantastic costumes listening to Mozart's glorious music fascinated by it all.

3698654,1,B001MSC61A,"Though clearly a high budget production, this version of the Magic Flute by the Metropolitan Opera is quite disappointing.

Fully translated into English and edited to a duration of two hours, it is more akin to a Broadway musical than to a classic work.

On film, the over-size puppets are more irritating than spectacular and make-up often appears outrageously overdone.  Also, costume design is oftentimes very questionable.  For instance, Papageno seems to be wearing a cage and the three child-spirits are ridiculously underdressed as Cupids. Worst of all, some of the casting is dubious with Tamina speaking English with a strong Asian accent, Papagena anything but attractive (even when rejuvenated) and the three boys just unable to sing adequately.

Overall, despite its low price, this DVD simply cannot be recommended to anyone.",1451001600,2,839,5.325757575757576

I did not witness greatness in the libretto, music or performances.  It was sung in English enhanced by well-needed English subtitles.  I think children or unjaded young adults might give this opera five stars.",1437782400,,458,5.2465753424657535
3698658,3,B001MSC61A,"This is a beautiful production. Kids might like it. I personally dislike the English. The music changes when adapted to English. It changes the cadence. I would like to see the same production in German. It's Mozart and hard to beat even when forced to conform to English. Still, there is no reason to change the language

I deducted 2 stars: -1 from English -1 for abridged

The singing is beautiful and the staging magical. You have to like it. But if a production is made for American kids, then label it so. This isn't in the same class as many of the other ""Flutes"" available.",1437696000,3,581,4.471698113207547

There's bad and there's worse. This is worse. From the translation to the practically non-existent costumes, to rotten, senseless staging (really, a field of lit-up plastic flowers and a sheet of glass on top? Michaels' flower aisle looks better. It'd also be cheaper).

If this is what all their operas look like the Met is not longer a stager of great operas but a butcherer instead. Who decided to cut and cut and cut? Who decided to speak the recitative? Steal costume ideas from Disney?

I confess that the color screens with waves of color are cool... But I saw effects equally delightful at a hockey game's opening night, without their compromising the integrity of the game, as has been done to this opera.

Having performed in a production of this opera myself, I know it can be difficult to ""bring to life"", understand and ""sell"" to an audience.  Taymor's version made me truly enjoy this opera as I had not before...THANK YOU!.

I have subsequently used this with my elementary students, who have also delighted in the opera and even asked to see it again!  It is vocally as well as visually gratifying.  I loved the minimalist sets and the work that must have gone into acting, enunciation, etc.  (By the way, The Magic Flute is often done in vernacular language of where it is performed.  It is an opera, yes, but has singspiel aspect of spoken dialogue.  The singers have to work with dialogue acting coaches oftentimes.)  I like this abridged format of the opera!  It made more sense to me dramatically and I still saw all the ""bits"" I was accustomed to.

All things considered, the German version recorded off public television years ago in videotape format is a much better production.

The singing is the first class. Especially the Queen of the Night Erika Miklsa is super. This opera has important role of the Three Ladies. The Three ladies are marvelous.

Should the producer consider put the show on Broadway? I like Lion King but I think Magic Flute is much better than Lion King in terms of the puppets, lighting and songs.

3698734,2,B001MSC61A,"Here's the deal: I love the Magic Flute. As a high soprano, the Queen of the Night's vengeance aria is a holy grail of sorts. However, this production is shockingly sub par! The first issue I take with it is the fact that it is both abridged and in English. This is the Metropolitan Opera, not some undergrad opera program at a state school, and even those sing the actual songs in German. If you want less intense exposure to the Magic Flute, watch Indiana U's production. The second beef is the singing; Papageno should not be the favorite for singing as well as comedy! He outshines Tamino greatly, as Matthew Polanzani's voice is beautiful but lacks richness. The Queen of the Night is one of my biggest disappointments, however. Her tone is clear and she hits those high notes like a champ without a squeak, but she's clumsy. She has an overpowering vibrato and she simply doesn't sing the quick coloratura included in the piece. She just leaves out the sixteenth notes leading up to the famous passage, and half-fakes her way through the run of triplets. Her acting is superb, however, as is Papageno's. The rest are very much lacking in that department; Tamino seems as a timid girl at times, and Pamina hardly seems vulnerable and lovestruck as much as an opera singer who hasn't mastered acting in spoken dialogue. The production is imaginative and beautiful, but hardly redeems the singing and acting that is lacking in parts.

Watch the version with Diana Damrau as the Queen of the Night, and you'll hear how it's meant to be sung.",1329955200,14,1543,4.672794117647059

3698738,2,B001MSC61A,"This is not a standard ""Flute.""  Fine print on the case discloses that this is a 112-minute ""abridged"" version (some 45 minutes short of a brisk, full-length production), and nothing on the case discloses that it's performed with a loose English translation rather than in the usual original German.  I'm not diametrically opposed to translation or even judicious cuts, but those aspects of this disc -- deal breakers for many opera lovers -- should at least be clear.

What's worse is that the cuts are not judicious.  They're terrible, beginning with the overture -- a wonderful and well-known piece of music in its own right, begun here in the middle with the second Adagio before the development section.  I can't believe they performed it this way.  It's musically illiterate, like starting a pop song at the bridge.  The rest of the opera suffers from major musical cuts, not just forgivable cuts in spoken dialogue.

For example, Tamino's gorgeous Act I aria (""This portrait is enchantingly beautiful..."") -- one of the reasons to love the thing -- is butchered, confined to just the last section.  The Pamina-Papageno Act I duet is cut entirely.  The march of the priests is also cut, as is the priests' duet (fine) and the priests' chorus (not fine).  Half of Sarastro's big Act II aria (""Within these sacred halls..."") goes out the window.  The lovely Sarastro-Pamina-Tamino trio is gone.  The scene with the three boys where Pamina contemplates suicide is also cut.  I'm sure that's not all.

Taymor's production features lots of wavy cloth, masks, long fingernails, lots of stuff on cables, complicated set manipulation.  To my taste, the look and feel is more chilly than charming, but it does achieve some neat effects.  At times, you're too aware of the production's fussiness -- as where, for example, the singers have to work with moving platforms noisily being wheeled across the stage by stagehands in black.  At other times, the production is delightful and clever, as where Papageno's Act II feast takes the form of suspended pieces of food dancing above and around him, including serpent-like sausage links, or where Papageno pursues a dancing ballerina during his Act II aria, ""A girl or little wife....""  Some aspects didn't make sense, though, like Tamino's Samurai-like costume and make-up (white face, black wig with a bun).  There wasn't a consistent Asian theme, so this decidedly unflattering getup seemed incoherent.

The performance is generally solid, and, in the case of Sarastro and the Queen of the Night, impressive.  (Hence the two stars.)  But the two lovers' voices lack a richness that you hope for in these roles.

A note about ""HD"":  Yes, this is part of the Met's ""HD Live"" program, but you will not get the sharpness and clarity of high definition with this disc, because it's just a standard DVD.  The only way to get HD quality on disc is with a Blu-Ray version, and I don't believe that this is offered on Blu-Ray.  Best to skip it anyway.",1325980800,19,2987,4.898406374501992

OK, I agree that is interesting to produce an easy-to-listen-to opera to captivate new audiences, but why Mr. Levine has agreed to cut so drastically the overture is beyond my comphehension. One additional issue: for those who know this beloved opera by heart, listening to Tamino, Pamina and company speaking English seems quite disconcerting. In summ: if we had the complete (with due repetitions) overture I would give a second star.

3698743,5,B001MSC61A,"As an elementary school music teacher, I was blown away by this stunning version of Mozart's masterpiece, ""The Magic Flute,"" with the amazing atmosphere and stage/scenery/costume effects.  The extraordinary vision of this wonderful work as presented by the New York Met and Julie Taymore cannot be praised highly enough.  This has been a wonderful teaching tool for me as it completely destroys children's preconceived ideas about opera which are mostly gained from cartoon caricatures or comedy routines.  Virtually without exception, my students have hung on the actions and singing of the characters.  Since it is too long to see in one class period, I split it and my students are always reluctant to leave and beg me to show it next time.  This is how we will hook the next generation on classical music.  From my own point of view as an adult and music professional, I could watch this any number of times (and will!)  While all the stars are wonderful, the Queen of the Night (Erika Miklos) is this generation's Wicked Witch of the West with miraculous vocal performances and the air of menace and threat which she gives off.  But Nathan Gunn, as Papageno, is without a doubt one of the best performers who ever sang the role.  Not only is he musically superior, but his incandescent acting talent and comedic instincts are spot on. The first meeting between him and Monostatos was one of the high points of the performance in terms of the humorous side of this opera. The fact this production is in English with English subtitles and is condensed makes it a real asset with which to teach.  And it is so well done, that while one may miss some parts of the arias, the essentials are all there, intact.  As you can see, I loved it!",1322870400,31,1738,4.684210526315789

Nathan Gunn (Papageno) is a delight in one of my favorite operatic characters.  Erika Miklosa (the Queen of the Night) is superb, particularly her appearances at the inventive hands of Taymor.  Pape, Huang and Polenzani are all excellent as they transform one from a sterile Vienese Masonic setting into an atmosphere somewhere west of Tokyo.  Thank God Monostatos is not depicted as black.  Although I despise tampering with the classics to make them politically acceptable to the post modern mind-set, making this villain something other than black is a most pleasant departure.  It's all delightful.
  Levine's direction is wonderful, but his declining health is notable.
  The Meptropolitan Opera's attempt under Gelb and Halverson to make opera accessible to skeptical twenty-first century minds is honorable and successful.",1318636800,38,1285,5.275862068965517
3698746,5,B001MSC61A,"Can't understand why anyone would write a review give the DVD 5 stars yet not actually view the DVD and then give what they think is an educated synopsis of the Opera?

Never mind!

Back to the DVD, new release of the above said version and long awaited by many. The production is the English language version of Julie Taymor's hit production of Mozart's The Magic Flute, it is a visual as well as audio spectacular. The DVD is upgraded to full HD so nice crisp images and Dolby sound.

Conducted by Metropolitan Opera Music Director James Levine, the main cast includes Ying Huang as Pamina, Matthew Polenzani as Tamino, and Ren Pape as Sarastro, the true outstanding stars of this performance are Erika Miklsa as Queen of the Night with a wonderful rendition of the the Queen of the Night aria but Nathan Gunn as Papageno absolutely stole the show with his comic portrayal of his role.

Lovely abridged version of Mozart's Magic Flute in English.

Region 1, so only viewable on multi region DVD players or Blu Ray players in the UK.",1314921600,79,1034,4.5978260869565215
3698747,5,B001MSC61A,"The Magic Flute is an enchanting, crashing, bore, to me.  I am not interested in Masonry.  I am not interested in a labored exposition of Virtue from the Enlightenment.  I adore serpents with feathers, boys in balloons, rustics with singing birds, brave young men with pretty girls, and ghastly hags. I adore all of Mozart's music, but this music is Mozart drunk on Champagne, Chanel No. 5, and rainbows.

I have not seen this DVD, though I have ordered it.  It is the DVD of a live performance at the Met last Christmas, which I did see.  I am a fairly blue-nosed opera lover, usually frosty about cut versions, childrens' versions, versions in English, and so on, every one of which this is.  For my opening reasons, I find this particular production genius.

It goes for enchantment, it goes for sheer love of the music (James Levine, the greatest living operatic conductor, and the Metropolitan orchestra!), it goes for wit and high spirits.  It is designed for the happiness (and attention span) of quite young children, but not at all for the virtuous boredom of their elders.

It was meant for Christmas.  Maybe it should be kept for Christmas.  If you have a child who has never seen an opera, this would be the First.  If you have never seen ""grand opera,"" this is your First.

We had Christmas Eve dinner after this Magic Flute at the Carlyle in New York.  I recognized several of the children who had been at the Met before.  They were easy to recognize.  Every single one was smiling.  Some were humming.

Of course we need full, classic, uncut, German productions of this, one of Mozart's greater operas.  I shall be at Le Nozze di Figaro those nights.",1314403200,23,1665,4.617747440273037
3698748,5,B001MSC61A,We saw this when produced for television and taped it.  My 7 year old granddaughter was mesmorized.  She periodically would watch it and would sing the mother's aria in the shower.  Of particular interest to her was the beginning showing the backstage preparations.  When we changed our DVR player we lost it and she (now 8-1/2) was heartbroken.  Thank goodness through Amazon the Met Store had a copy at a very reasonable cost.  The sound quality is wonderful as is the picture. This is a wonderful introduction to opera for young people.  Julie Taymor's production is fascinating.  She brought the same imagination in staging she used in The Lion King.  Although opera purists might object and this version is abridged it is truly a delight. Now we have it forever.,1312416000,3,767,4.838461538461538
3698749,2,B001MSC61A,"Julie Taymor's production is a delicious treat.  I saw the full German version of this production the year it debuted and it was amazing.  Unfortunately, the MET has only released their holiday version in English (this item). I taped the PBS broadcast of the full-opera in German and have it saved on my DVR, but I'd like to have it on DVD.  It is the only reason I'm giving it two-stars because I'm hoping someone over that the MET will see this and consider putting it out...",1299456000,7,477,4.459770114942529
3698750,5,B001MSC61A,"I bought this for the grandkids to watch when they come to the house. They loved it so much after watching it 3 times,that we took them to the Met to see it live. Again a smash with them. Ages 8 and 5. This is a great way to get the young involved with opera and classical music. Buy it and spread the magic--Bill",1294790400,2,313,3.90625
3698751,5,B001MSC61A,"This is a gorgeous production, and Nathan Gunn's Papageno steals the show. I've seen Gunn both in the live production at the Met and in this video, and he's just perfect for the role.

I used this DVD to introduce my school-age children to opera. First, I played the CD in the background for a few weeks, so that the music would be a bit familiar. And then we watched the DVD--over and over again! They just loved it. Highly recommended for young and old alike!",1293321600,6,461,4.3604651162790695
3698752,5,B001MSC61A,"I can't believe it has been almost 4 years since this Opera production's first performance. When I saw it on PBS in 2006, I believed opera productions just got a breath of fresh air. Little did I know the Met was breathing fresh air into many new productions...

In this Magic Flute director Julie Taymore has hit a home-run in many respects with this production. First, she has made this masterpiece extremely accessible to young people...I mean young...4,5 and 6 yrs and up. I have shown it to preschoolers and older - they don't move from the TV. Many want to see it again! Second, the opera is extremely well sung and spoken in English making it more enjoyable without sub-titles. Finally, the costumes are well... recall Taymore's Lion King...perfect and well suited for this breathtaking re-think of The Magic Flute.

This production sets the bar very high for the next creative genius to top.

I do take exception with any comment regarding the cast. Although many may not be well known, the Met's GM Peter Gelb has chosen his singers very well. You will enjoy this DVD as no other opera video you own.",1281052800,6,1109,4.676923076923077
