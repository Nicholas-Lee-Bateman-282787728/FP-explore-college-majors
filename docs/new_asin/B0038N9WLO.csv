4090130,5,B0038N9WLO,"This is a must see. Very emotional. You can feel the emotion of the band knowing it's their last show as a group. Martin brings his kids out on the stage at one point, he shares from the word and thanks the fans for the many years of faithful support. You'll be moved as you watch it.",1293580800,,284,4.0
4090131,5,B0038N9WLO,This Blu-ray is worth any price. This concert demands the high definition sound and picture in order to do justice to a flawless farewell show for a cutting edge band.,1293494400,,167,4.6
4090132,5,B0038N9WLO,"I love the band Delirious and have been following them since the ""cutting edge"" days.  I have seen the guys live in concert four times, and this Blu-Ray is great and really captures the essence of a Delirious concert.  I highly recomend this Blu-ray to any current or future fan of the band Delirious.  You will not be dissapointed.",1285027200,,332,4.593220338983051
4090133,5,B0038N9WLO,"Well I've been a Delirious fan for the past 5years, and now they are my all time favorite band. This Farewell DVD is excellent. If you've been following them for awhile, it's even rather emotional. What can I say, you get attached to folks that love God and are as good as this band is. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes music and especially if you're a Delirious fan!",1283644800,,376,4.309859154929577
4090134,5,B0038N9WLO,This DVD is great!  So sad the band is no longer together. :(  This DVD is great though!,1280016000,,88,3.8333333333333335
4090135,5,B0038N9WLO,"Delirious has been my favorite band since first hearing the Cutting Edge cd's in 1996.  I have purchased every cd, (often both the U.K. release as well as the American release)every dvd, and have seen most of their tours.  Their music has sort of been the soundtrack of my Christian walk since first hearing them.  For me watching this dvd created both happy and sad moments.  The recording is superb, the song selection could not be better, and the close-ups of the band reveal their emotions so well.  You are able to see the joy, sadness, and even the uncertainty in their eyes.  I found it hard not to cry at several points in the dvd. They are going to be missed so greatly, and this dvd is a perfect closing to this chapter in life.",1277942400,,738,4.389705882352941
4090136,5,B0038N9WLO,"I loved it!!!!
I only wish they would play the whole concert unedited
viewing from front and center, as if I was sitting there.
With occasional closeups or
side angle shots with less camera jumping around.
I guess thats a younger generation thing.",1275868800,,247,4.767441860465116
4090137,5,B0038N9WLO,"Delirious changed the way modern worship sounds! And when they decided after 17 years to unpack their bags and actually stay home with their young families, they wisely caught that last show on an absolutely fantastic dvd called FAREWELL. The quality of the video cannot be topped, fantastic camera angles! The sound is extraordinary - I watched it on my Bose system cranked up loud and it was like actually being there. Highlight for me: The reunion of original drummer Stew Smith on Investigate! He played with an intensity and power rarely seen. This is by far the best live concert video I've ever seen. If you don't know Delirious, this will get you hooked. If you have loved them, this will break your heart - watching the D kids dance on stage, and then, the entire families join their spouses and dads at the final bow, was emotional and heart-rending. I will watch this again and again.",1274659200,,895,4.670886075949367
4090138,5,B0038N9WLO,"If you are a fan of Delirious?, you should LOVE this DVD!!!  As soon as I can, I'll be ordering the CD set from Amazon.  Although, I have all of these songs on their other CDs and DVDs, most of these versions of my favorite songs sounded better to me on this DVD (with longer guitar solos and GREAT audio of the audience singing along).

NICE close-up shots of the band and the audience!  In some ways, it was almost better than seeing them ""live"".  When I saw them live (2x), I was far away from the large monitors.  This DVD has shots of all the instruments being played, which makes it extra enjoyable for worship leaders to view.  The entire concert had me glued to it (the extras did too).

There are Many special treats for those who are familiar with this band - a special appearance by Stew Smith (their original drummer), their children coming up on stage, and a behind the scenes look at their final European tour.  My plan is to get this DVD as gifts for friends who like the older worship songs, which are included in the extras.  It was a kick to hear the songs from their Cutting Edge days and to see Martin playing the Mandolin (even though I prefer the ""rock"" style songs).

Warning (before you buy it) - if seeing Martin becoming teary-eyed gets to you (like it does to me), make sure that you have a box of tissues close by prior to hitting the play button!

This DVD is reasonably priced, considering all of the extras it includes, and would make a WONDERFUL gift for anyone who likes Delirious? songs that were recorded 1992-2009.",1274486400,,1550,4.381118881118881

8391556,5,B0038N9WLO,"The Delirious? experience has always been best served live, and this blu-ray is certainly no exception. From old classics like ""I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever"" to new tunes in the line of ""My Soul Sings"", the video is jammed full of all the passion, heart, and feel that fans old and new have come to expect from the Littlehampton quintet. The video includes not just the main set, but also the ""Cutting Edge"" set, where the d: boys performed material from their days as the Cutting Edge Band.

In the order of the actual performance:

Cutting Edge

The kickoff - Fans will recognize this pre-recorded track as the first one on Live and in the Can. A backwards-spinning clock takes us back to 1992...

I'm Not Ashamed - Kicking off the Cutting Edge set is I'm Not Ashamed, from Cutting Edge 3: Red Tape. Though missing the second verse, the song is performed beautifully.

Happy Song - Fans will remember this Country/Pop tune from Cutting Edge Two. It's all here, the mandolin, the bouncing crowd, and Tim Jupp's ""Yeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhh!!!"" during the bridge

Shout To The North - Unfortunately this is little more than a reprise of the chorus of this iconic song.

Thank You For Saving Me / White Ribbon Day - This tune cranks the worship atmosphere up to ""high"", in a faithful, wonderfully played version of the song. Certainly among my favourites in the set. The bridge for King of Fools' ""White Ribbon Day"" makes an appearance near the end

I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever - One of the best-known worship tunes of the modern world, the Cutting Edge Band doesn't fail to disappoint here.

Find Me In The River - Last known to have appeared in a d: setlist in 2001, it finally makes it's last appearance here, and the atmosphere couldn't be more perfect.

Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble / Dance In The River - This mountain-shaking song is played to perfection, and the crowd is right there with the D:boys for the experience. As usual, it has Dance In The River paired with it, and the Delirious? wives and children take the stage for the dancing. Stu G's solo sounded a little rough at the beginning, but ironed out well.

The Delirious? Set

All This Time - Bursting on to the stage, the D:boys started by rocking the house with this Mission Bell tune.

Bliss - The Mezzamorphis album makes it's last appearance in a D: concert with this blissfully energetic tune.

Solid Rock - First appearing on 2005's The Mission Bell, it's performed to great effect here by the gang. The bridge, performed by Jesus Freak penman TobyMac on the album, is taken up by Martin and his white megaphone one last time.

Sanctify - It's Wembley all over again! Quite literally, as the D: boys are even decked out in their jerseys at this point, and visuals from the Wembley video adorne the screen behind the band.

Obsession - I don't think there's a word in the dictionary to describe this track. Stunning is all I could come up with, which is saying something since I was on my knees crying. Everything that made Delirious? great is here, and the whole song is a prayer. The emotion of the d: boys is there for all to see and hear, as Paul and Jon drive the song while Tim's keys, Stu's guitar, and Martin's vocals cry out to Jesus in a voice so packed full of emotion it will reduce a grown man to tears.

Rain Down - Things pick up with Rain Down, from World Service. Well executed, but not my favourite live version of this song

Deeper - What D: farewell show would be complete without their first big hit? Performed very well here.

Paint The Town Red - Performed to great effect. Martin finished the song off with the customary megaphone, but at the end, rather than hand it off to a stage hand, he passed it to a young man in the audience that had caught his attention. ""This is for you now, I don't need it any more."" It was a somber reminder to me about the finality of this concert.

Inside Outside - Stu G takes the reins here in this hit single from World Service.

Jesus' Blood / King Or Cripple / True Colours: This appeared on the American version of Mezzamorphis, but it didn't show up in the UK until Glo. Played with a lot of emotion by the gang, and coupled with the choruses from ""King or Cripple"" and ""True Colours"". I found them very enjoyable.

Majesty: This modern worship icon receives a great response here, and the audience acted more as a choir here, taking the entire first chorus without any prompting from Martin.

Our God Reigns: Basically just a reprise of the chorus, but still excellent.

Investigate: Oops, somebody put an extra drum set on the stage. Or did they? In a surprise move, former D: drummer Stewart Smith enters, to the delight of (and deafening applause from) the fans. This Glo classic is performed to perfection, with Stew and Paul banging out a rhythym of biblical proportions that is perfectly in sync.

History Maker: No Delirious set list, much less a live album, would be complete without this anthem from 1997. First released on King of Fools, this song grabbed Delirious faithful by the collar and refused to let go. Namesake of the tour, the Greatest Hits album and D's title for their fans, this history-making, chart-topping, venue-rocking, life-changing epic is played out in all of it's prayer-answering glory. Psalm 23 is woven into the tapestry, and I couldn't have asked for a better way for them to say farewell to this masterpiece.

My Soul Sings: I wasn't sure how I'd feel at this point, knowing I'd be watching the end of Delirious' last performance, at least for now. But what I got was the perfect song to soothe my soul. Stu G, Martin, Jon, Paul, and Tim weave a tapestry so touching, perfect, and full of emotion here, I guarantee you'll have it on repeat for a while. The video feed makes it even more powerful, with Martin visibly struggling (and sometimes failing) to keep going despite being near tears himself. The choir of an audience picks up for him though, and it's incredible to hear five thousand people crying ""My soul sing, my soul sings, my soul sings, how I love You!""

One last time, Delirious? bow and, after 17 years of being pop's best kept secret, and the band that started the modern worship movement, the boys pass the torch to us, the history makers.

If ever there is the perfect ending to a God-driven career, this live video/album is it. I'm sad that Glo didn't get more representation, and Audio Lessonover/Touch is nowhere to be found, but otherwise, this is everything I could have asked for and so much more.

It's worth it's weight in gold.
