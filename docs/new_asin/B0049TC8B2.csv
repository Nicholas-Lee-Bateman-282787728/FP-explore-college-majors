The artwork and execution of action sequences is flawless, especially in this Blu-ray format.

4295016,2,B0049TC8B2,"The anime is Ok, not much more. The real problem is it succeed to make you interrested enough to want to see how it would end but the anime does not end. So you are left with an unsatisfaying end that make you feel like it didn't worth your time. With a real conclusion, it could have been a 3 star anime but without it, I can't give more than 2. Substract 1 star if you don't like violence enough :)",1320451200,3,400,3.950617283950617

4295018,4,B0049TC8B2,"This Show is great if your are a berserk fan the only down side is that the complete series only shows the first 32 chapters of the manga and so you have to continue the story by reading the manga, which is where the story actually picks up.",1312934400,,241,4.041666666666667
4295019,3,B0049TC8B2,"I'm reviewing this because I thought people might like to know what the show is like!

Shigurui is an historical samurai drama, but it's not exactly comfort TV. The style is extremely arty, especially during the first few episodes - many many shots of dead cicadas, etc. The pace is also extremely slow, and the ending won't make much sense unless you paid attention to one particular line from the narrator in the middle of the series. You should also take care not to be confused by the flashback near the beginning (it might be more accurate to say the show starts with a flashforward).

At the same time, this show is extremely violent and depraved. Apart from various people having their guts spilled and many different body parts chopped off, there are sex scenes, including a senile old man trying to seduce his daughter, and, laughably, one instance of autofellatio. There is a serious point to the shock value, which is that the absolute obedience demanded of dojo members, combined with an obsession to be the best swordsman, leads them to make themselves into something ultimately much less than human. But the execution of these themes is always over the top and exploitative.

All this means that this show is for a particular audience, and not for the mainstream. You'll know if it's for you from the above description. Even allowing for the specialised tastes this show caters to, it is less than perfect, particularly in its pacing. It could profitably be cut down to a 2-hour movie without losing anything important. All these factors considered, it's still worth a look.",1311897600,16,1588,4.830882352941177

DO NOT BUY if you want an anime that has a conclusion,DO NOT BUY if you want a show that moves at a steady pace. DO NOT BUY if you want any real character developement. So many will be attracted by the name, thinking they will get to see awesome fight scenes. They will be disappointed the fights are abysmal. They last seconds and have none of the style and brutality that they should have. There are sadistic acts committed but even these feel trife and exhausting. The absolute worst part of this series is the unsympathetic and wicked characters whose only growth is that of a brain tumor. I like stories where I can feel for the characters.

4295091,2,B0049TC8B2,"Takes three-four episodes to develop the story and characters. It's hard to keep watching at first, but seems like it is going to turn out to be a decent series. The series starts with a match between two swordsman and cuts to the being of the journey for both of them before the match starts. The series builds the story line of both men heading towards the battle.  Then it ends abruptly, leaving a great deal of the story out and not making it to how it started.

4295111,5,B0049TC8B2,"This series is like an art piece; it is poetry written in blood. The violence is copious, but far from gratuitous. This isn't for the faint of heart, or the weak of stomach. Yes, parts of ""Shugurui"" do come off as misogynistic, but not unrealistically so. Women are treated like property, and although that may upset the delicate sensibilities of the modern viewer, this was the case in many cultures during the not-so-distant past. As far as the treatment of homosexuality, the idea of nanshoku was very much a part of samurai life. Unlike some, I didn't feel as though the portrayal of the page's lover was perverse, aside from the auto-fellatio bit, which was a somewhat unrealistic and impressive example of flexibility. He expressed real grief over the young man's murder, and was the only one at the dojo to do so, as well as the only one to worry that justice had not been done for Suzu.

For those that complain that the series is slow moving, I have to wonder if we are watching the same anime. ""Shigurui"" is deliberate in the way of a poisonous serpent; it catches its prey in an unbreakable hypnotic hold. The story builds steadily from the flash-forward beginning, and the viewer is propelled through the past, and through the blood-soaked rivalry of Irako and Fujiki. The series revolves around the struggle for power that erupts between the two, and is spiced throughout with lust, deception, murder, and violence.

One of the marked aspects that makes this anime compelling is the fact that there are no heroes. Each and every character is flawed, and there is no stark line drawn between good and evil. Irako is grasping, devious, and, by turns, cowardly; he is, however, the only character in the series that is not enslaved by blind obedience. His capacity for free thought, as well as his capacity for cruelty, set him apart; in the end, the blind samurai has the clearest individual sight, and that sight is set on revenge. While Fujiki is the closest thing that the series offers up as a hero, he is crippled by an unreasoning devotion to Kogan and the dojo, and that loyalty is given at any cost. Fujiki is willing to do anything that his sensei asks of him, even if it goes against everything that he believes to be right.

""Shigurui"" somehow manages to be, simultaneously, understated and over the top. I feel as though the violence and the interactions with the characters are done on a subtle enough level to be effective without hitting the viewer over the head. There is also a great deal of artistry and grace to the scenes of brutality, which somehow manages to lend them a beauty all their own.

I would be lying if I didn't admit that the ending of ""Shigurui"" is maddeningly abrupt. I was taken off guard, and was initially a bit disappointed, by the ending. However, one needs to take into account that the anime is only a portion of the tale. ""Shigurui"" deserves high marks for its grace and beautiful execution, as well as for its frank portrayal of humanity. After all, nobility doesn't always reside in the darker recesses of the human heart.",1388793600,6,3079,4.664825046040516
4295112,1,B0049TC8B2,"I want to  give this no stars. Quite possible the worst anime I have seen. There is no action SEQUENCE. Just two people standing in front of each other... ""Oh this is the blah blah forbidden technique that no one ever survives"" and suddenly BOOM, limbs are shown cut off. Like I said, no fighting just body parts suddenly on the ground. Who ever made this just loves to talk about sword technique throughout the entire series. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Even if you are into boring slow stuff just go watch some clouds in the sky and save your money at least.",1385942400,3,558,4.365384615384615
4295113,5,B0049TC8B2,"Death Frenzy is not for everyone, that's for sure. Fans of samurai anime will be desperate for a faster, more coherent storyline with constant battles. Fans of mega-violence will likely find the story bland, disjointed, and short on vampires.

Shigurui is a cruel snapshot of a twisted rivalry set against the backdrop of the worst feudal Japan has to offer. Females and males are sexually exploited for recreation. Loyalty to master and clan is bred and enforced with cult-like methods. This is not Bleach, Hellsing, or Ninja Scroll. This is an artistic experiment that pays off for a select audience, myself included. But I can see how most viewers would find the eccentricity hard to swallow. If successful, I hope to warn away buyers who would hate it and help to save their money, while still attracting potential fellow appreciators from that select audience. Let's get to it:

***PROS***

ANIMATION/ART
Resembles Ninja Scroll (movie), but more detailed and reserved. Dark and moody, the cinematography resembles films like Citizen Kane, There Will be Blood, and Kurosawa's grimmer exploits. Human anatomy is a focal point and brings the viewer uncomfortably close to the violence. There are many cutaways to dead cicadas and water dripping from bamboo, which would seem like boring gimmicks to some, but meaningful paintings to others. The nudity is not fan-service but instead drifts between tantalizing and humiliating--once again, with anatomy and cinematography being king. This is a must-watch if you're a big fan of art themed in feudal Japan . . . unless you're turned off by intrusive, disturbing imagery.

MUSIC/MOOD
The music is a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and terrifying tones that force scenes to linger and hold tension, creating an effective audio-narrative that insists on a constant feeling of dread. In unison with the dynamic imagery, the soundtrack reaches for a hypnotic effect aimed at keeping the viewer spellbound and nervous. On the flipside, I can also see how such unrelenting dissonance could be considered a gimmick (style in place of substance). I was spellbound and nervous.

STORY
Death Frenzy is about two samurai who are fated to be obsessed rivals. Their dojo becomes the backdrop for their plans against one another, and they each develop a special style of martial art (or ""kill move"") that's been forged by their own suffering. The master of the clan is a wicked old man who slips into dementia seasonally (like a hibernating bear), urinates on himself, uses his daughter as a sounding board for his sick impulses, and is the keeper of truly threatening secrets of martial arts. Everyone obeys him out of fear and respect. *BUYER BEWARE* This series has NO ENDING. It resembles ""Berserk"" in its narrative. If you follow along only to see who the better warrior is, you will be disappointed. The purpose of the series is to explore the makings of these two monsters of combat. The viewer must theorize who would be victorious. Did I want to see them brawl to the death? Oh, hell yes. But I respect the creators' choice.

***CONS***

LENGTH
Despite respecting the artistic integrity of the piece, I would have liked to follow these two warriors all the way to the end. I wanted to see what kind of life could be livable after such horrific upbringings.

OVERDOSE OF STYLE
I loved the style of this show, but even I grew tired in some areas and wished for a less disjoined narrative and more concrete explanations. Having to interpret every single shard of this story as its own painting was taxing, but necessary to understand what the creators were trying to do. Its beauty is its fault, I suppose.

I was deeply moved by this work, but would recommend it sparingly. It truly is a painting. For me, the Mona Lisa is just a well-painted picture of a half-smiling, sleepy chick, but to someone else, it's a window into the soul of an era. Likewise, Shigurui's resonance depends on personal perspective. If you're curious, take the plunge. If not, walk on to safer anime. I hope this helped.

I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",1381622400,2,4223,4.9102384291725105
4295114,5,B0049TC8B2,"Goodness gracious. This may be the best Anime put to film ever created. I read the manga and found it to be average compared to other manga in the same category, but the whoever wrote and directed this Anime seriously deserves an award. It's so cleverly edited and directed and I can't convey how much praise I have for it. Fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey will love this Anime because it is similar in style, and what I mean by that is there are a lot of deeper meanings to every scene portrayed.",1379808000,,494,4.26595744680851
4295115,5,B0049TC8B2,"Amazing series with fantastic story and character development.  The animation, the battles, and the emotion that this series presents is fantastic.  Only downside is that the series has never been completed and the end is...well there is no ending.  You just see the path of two samurai from the same school standing before one another about to battle to death and that is where it stops.  Kind of a major piss off in my opinion, but hopefully one day they may actually complete the story, I am just hoping they can match the greatness of the series years after it had abruptly ended.",1377216000,,584,4.640776699029126

As an anime, it's brilliant! It starts over very slow, but builds... and builds... and then see above. :(

4295124,3,B0049TC8B2,I loved the artwork in the anime. The fact that it incorporated history into a kick ass anime series is amazing. Though most of the anime is dull and boring it has a great story and is indeed a graphic masterpiece.,1352764800,2,214,4.2439024390243905
4295125,5,B0049TC8B2,"With a backdrop of true events and based on the manga series written by Takayuki Yamaguchi, the anime series ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a very violent tale of lust, dark ambition and vengeance that takes place during the 1600's in the Tokugawa period. Yamaguchi took his ideas from the novel called ""Surugajyo Gozenjiai"" and with director Hiroshi Hamasaki, the two have put together a harrowingly beautiful anime series that pretty much took my breath away. The series is about the famed Kogan school of Japanese swordplay, which became famous in the Kagegawa region, mainly because of the tutelage of a mysterious swordsman named Iwamoto Kogan. Unlike the chambara films we've seen in the past, this is not a series about honor, loyalty and duty; it is a melodrama about a school, its sensei and his apprentices. IT IS NOT YOUR KID'S Anime.

The series begins with two scarred warriors facing off against each other in a brutal contest to satisfy the bloodlust of a cruel lord Tadanaga Tokugawa; a blind swordsman named Irako Seigen (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) and a one-armed swordsman called Gennosuke Fijiki (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa). These two warriors carry the scars of a very violent and twisted past. They were bitter rivals under the tutelage of sword master Kogan Iwamoto (Seizou Katou); the two aspired to attain the mastery of the Kogan style secret techniques and to be worthy of their sensei's beautiful daughter Mie (Houko Kuwashima). This is the story of these two warriors who had mortally wounded each other--physically, emotionally and psychologically, all for the honor to become the heir to the Kogan school. Now they must gird themselves for one last battle...

""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a series divided into 12 parts (2 discs). The presentation contains beautiful animation, visceral and violent swordplay, and has been noted because of the amount of graphic sex and nudity. The screenplay and direction are both beautiful and ugly. It is beautiful because it utilizes superb style in its cinematography. The colors lean towards the use of earth colors, and a little muted which adds to its brooding, intense mood and gloomy style. This has been done to reflect on the bleakness of its subject matter which brings us to its ugly face. The ugliness I speak of hover mostly around in its disquieting storyline. The subject matter is about the darkness within the ""way of Bushido"". I wouldn't say that these men are true samurai who follow the ideals of that code--these men are very human, full of lust, greed, betrayal, and ambitions. Unlike other chambara features we have been privy to, they are NOT men to be admired for their character; they may be admired for their skills but they are mostly to be feared.

The screenplay by Yamaguchi is quite intense, taut and very moody. In the school, we see the workings of its inner circles, and the rules that apply to the Iwamoto residence. The feature also utilizes some very effective use of metaphors and symbolism. The Cicada is an insect used to signify apprenticeship because of its noisy, vibrating qualities. The dragonfly represents unrelenting totality because of the straight direction in its flight. The Butterfly is used to signify beauty and the unpredictable nature of one's future. I thought it was wise direction to use the ""flashing"" naked effect when one engages in swordplay--I think when fighting, one's nature is utterly exposed and one is unprotected. Sure, it also displays the movement of muscles in engagements but it was a lot more than that. The direction relies on some fragmented sequences, to further give its characters their dimensions in the story. Quite clever and ingenious, the proceedings manage to maintain its intensity in not just its graphic violence.

The action sequences aren't really your run-of-the-mill choreography. Slow-motion animation, freeze frames and close-ups are utilized. The swordplay is very graphic and it never holds back. Eyes and limbs are severed, beheadings, bowels and entrails are graphically shown, and looks very reminiscent to Japanese effects we've all been privy to. Dismemberments are done quite often, as well as ""skinning"" and faces and bones being smashed in. The thing is director Hamasaki does the Blood and Gore in a very artistic kind of way, it was impressive--not too repulsive but certainly shocking. The combatants imagine just how they would react to an attack before the actual combat begins which serves as a sort of a teaser to the viewer.

The feature does have its share of graphic violence towards women, but I don't think it glorifies it at all. It uses those actions to display the cruelty of its characters, most specifically sensei Kogan; who manhandles his daughter and has a lot of sex with his mistress, lady Iku (Emi Shinohara) when he is in a state on dementia. Oh, this feature has a lot of graphic sex and nudity. There are some very twisted displays of torture and violence; castrations by fire, cut-off nipples and burned breasts are what you are in for. Incest and sick desires are also hinted at. Yes, this is one disturbing anime feature and not for the weak of heart.

The characters are for the most part very human, in a way they give in to their carnal desires, pride and blind obedience--it does have certain undertones about curses and karma. Irako is the prideful apprentice, who almost whose goal is to attain fame and fortune--he is also a womanizer and proves to be his main weakness. Mie is the daughter of the master swordsman, Kogan; she is dutiful and becomes imbalanced in a way. Lady Iku is the beautiful mistress of Kogan who is always taunted at by children and believes her body to be cursed. Iwamoto Kogan is the sensei who becomes demented from time to time for reasons unspecified; probably due to his very violent ways. I suppose if a hero is to be had from this feature it would be Gennosuke, the stoic pupil, ever obedient to his sensei who carries a grudge against his rival--Gennosuke is driven to master the art. Let's not forget Gonzaemon Ushimata (Yosaku Yara), his one flaw may be his blind obedience.

The animation is fluid and very beautiful and it was almost photorealistic. There are no bulging, over-expressive eyes and the facial expressions speak a lot for their emotions and manner. I thought it was wise for the animators to give its characters certain features quite unique to one another. Each separate scene have a use of one color hue to express its mood, but stays within earth colors--to signify its worldly workings in its environment. If there are some flaws, it would fall on some minor details undefined and it does lack some closure.

""SHIGURUI DEATH FRENZY"" is one twisted and brilliant animated production. It successfully reaches a plateau that surprisingly mixes beauty and repulsive qualities. It was almost as if this may be the final product if Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike had collaborated. It is so beautiful that one would be hard-pressed to say that it is all about disturbing imagery yet NONE can deny its visceral, brooding tone. It does efficiently represent what it is trying to say and gets its message across; The beauty of swordsmanship can lead to one's damnation when wielded irresponsibly. ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is beautiful, and magnificently executed, but it also leaves a repulsive taste in your mouth. I am very impressed as to how it managed to balance beauty and artistry with ugliness and repulsive nature. I almost didn't want the show to end.

The plot, however, is well written. It has a very carefully crafted story, and interesting characters. The violence is way extreme, but realistic. As far as quality goes it's great. I'm just not that fond of stories that are as dark a this one. It can put you in a dark frame of mind. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll probably get a lot of satisfaction out of Shigurui. The animation quality and voice acting are very well done. It's a gamble I think, but some gambles pay off.",1350604800,3,635,4.389830508474576
4295127,3,B0049TC8B2,"This is one of the darkest, most disturbing anime's I have seen as far as a TV series goes. Death Frenzy is an apt title for this. We are taken back nearly 400 years in Japan to a brutal time where life is cheap, and samurai are the enforcers of the land. Make no mistake, these are not heros doing great deeds to save the people. They are ruthless cold blooded killers to be feared, and practice their lethal sword art to dispatch anyone that dishonors them or challenges them in the most ruthless & efficient of ways.

This was done by studio Madhouse (one of the best), and has great visual mixes of style. We often see collages of images - sometimes going between very artfull stills, color animation, pencil drawings, etc to keep your eyes happy. Scenes of bloody graphic violence between fighters, and rather depraved treatment towards women is prevelant, so it is not for the faint of heart.

The big knock for people to be aware of is this is just part of the story, and just ends abruptly as if it were planned to keep going. The story is introduced with a tournament between two legendary but severely damaged samurai who are obviously bitter rivals, then jumps back in time to tell the story of how this all developed right before the match starts. However, after 13 episodes it ends and you realize they still have quite a ways to go to tell the story completely. I did not know this before watching, so was very disappointed at the end of episode 13 after getting rather hooked on this story. I read later that the anime only tells the first chapter of the manga it is based on.",1344556800,3,1591,4.426621160409557
4295128,4,B0049TC8B2,"Shigurui has a lot of blood, guts ,story, betrayal, deception, loyalty, nudity, sex, homosexual urges, ronan, confusion and so on. But the series finishes on a cliff hanger and leaves a big question on one of the main chareacters, What the F!
But I enjoyed the storyline........... Jult Warfell",1337904000,,294,5.020408163265306
4295129,5,B0049TC8B2,"Firstly, I must note that Shigurui is NOT for kids. There is nudity, though not in excess, and there is quite a bit of gore. With that out of the way, I must say that I personally consider Shigurui to be the best anime that I have ever seen. The visual rendition is quite unique and very intense at times. The music is mystifying and captivating, often entailing sporadic drumming and dark humming with a pleasant touch of the biju. Some say Shigurui is too slow paced, but they miss the point. This anime is not about mindless sword swinging,it's about people who dedicate their lives to mastering their arts to the point of obsession. The show showcases true swordplay and battles are often decided with one swing of the blade.

Now the major problem people site in the series is the cliffhanger ending. It stems from the fact that the series only adapts the first part of the manga (the anime was done before the manga was completed) and chooses to include a scene from the final part of the manga at the beginning of the anime. Believe me, the anime stops at a very clear point of the story and there really is no problem there. All animes do this to some extent leaving you to figure out where its characters end up from there, unless they all die. People make it sound as if Shigurui just suddenly makes an abrupt halt, but it seriously doesn't. Their problem is with the first scene which shows what becomes of the two main characters in the future. If you were to remove it, all these complaints would go away. The scene is irrelevant to the actual anime, and is just a bonus since the manga is never fully adapted.

Shigurui is an amazing series. If all you care about is a whole lot of flashy swordplay, this probably isn't for you. If you're willing to personally invest yourself in the story and its characters, this is your moment. I have seen this series 4 times already, and I don't plan on stopping there.",1325894400,23,1921,4.4390934844192635
4295130,5,B0049TC8B2,"Bought this as a gift for an anime fan who also likes watching old timey Samurai films from ages ago.  It seemed like a perfect fit to me.  I would not watch it personally but I know he likes watching this kind of stuff all the time so I am sure it will be watched more than once.

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes old martial arts films and graphic anime shows.",1323734400,,368,4.013698630136986
8419379,5,B0049TC8B2,"This is the pinnacle of anime. It's hardcore and I haven't been able to find anything as good or as raw since I've seen/read this show/manga. The tempo is just right I'm my opinion; slow is smooth and smooth is fast. The story seems to end abruptly but it dosnt, you just have to read the manga to get to the end of the story. The manga has the exact same art and scenes this show just turned the first few chapters in to a motion picture.",1527897600,,439,4.057471264367816
8419380,5,B0049TC8B2,"Shigurui isn't as gory as I was led to believe.  However, it is an adult-themed anime.  It contains sexuality and violence; it's not intended for immature viewers.  I really enjoyed it.  The characters and their motivations are interesting.  The story moved forward and backwards in time, which made it difficult to follow at times.  The ending had me wanting more closure than I got.  Nevertheless, I definitely recommend it.  I am glad I added it to my collection.",1519171200,,466,4.884615384615385

8419385,2,B0049TC8B2,This is definitely not your average anime. Where you've got this overly skilled protagonist and they have their ups and downs. This is one of the weirdest Anime's that I have ever watched in my life. The animation is excellent.

8419388,5,B0049TC8B2,People will say it is not complete. It is true that you don't get to see the ending of the duel but you can see that in the book or manga. It is still great because they really did a real good job staying true to the source material even though they didn't conclude the story in the anime.,1456099200,,289,3.9152542372881354
