8435661,2,B004M7YRNI,"I watched this movie because an Amazon search placed it at the top of the list for movies starring Vivian Vance. Although the movie mentioned Lassie, it didn't have anything to do with Vivian Vance; she didn't even make a cameo appearance! Beyond that, the plot really wasn't very engaging. I simply can't recommend this movie to fans of Vivian Vance.",1385683200,,351,4.770491803278689
8435662,1,B004M7YRNI,"It's hard to tell if there's a story to this movie because of the following mishmash: the hard to take and few poorly performed stereotypical Asian pop songs; or the skateboarding for it's grade school level skill; or the two attempts at Parkour urban building jumping which were just poorly performed and made no storyline sense; or the cop who acts like he's a beach life guard for the whole movie and for some reason shows it at the end; or the dead girls in some super high tech glass lab aquariums who at the end are walking around and sort of sing in a band. If the intent was to show that Asian parental expectations are high this movie provided no thoughtful insight and if suicide is the result of expectation pressure then the movie leaves me with ""who cares"".

The acting was bland and the directing/cinematography was basically stand 5 meters away and just film.

Two hours afterwards, little is remembered. If you want more thoughts on this movie try The China Post review.",1310428800,,986,4.596590909090909
