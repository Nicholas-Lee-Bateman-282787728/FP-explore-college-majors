8401511,5,B003O9XANS,Christmas present for my wife.  She Loved it. played on all DVD player in the house. A bit of Tom Jones,1394841600,,103,3.9047619047619047
8401512,1,B003O9XANS,"This comedy deals with two guys who obtain Tom Jones' . . . uh, member, and try to sell it to collectors of such . . . memorabilia.  Right off the top there are obvious problems that make suspension of belief just about impossible, starting with the fact that Tom Jones is not dead, and yet everyone in the picture, not just the idiots, seem to buy that he is.  Never mind that even if he was dead, the way the come by the ""bit of"" is absurd.

But even if you buy into this, the movie starts falling apart at the seams fairly rapidly.  The people they run into and do battle with are far too ridiculous to be real, and the ""normal"" folk, if there are any, would have to be so gullible that they never could have obtained jobs as street sweepers, much less police officers or executives.  I understand it's a comedy, but they may as well filmed it as a cartoon, or in the same fashion as if The Monkees had made ""Head"" on acid.

By the end, when the heroes are wearing animal costumes (for no obvious reason) and engaging in a slow chase from a thousand police while driving some sort of garden cart, I just punched out the DVD, threw it away and found something more engaging to do, like clipping my toenails.  Maybe it got more absurd after that, I guess I'll never know.  Zero stars.",1275004800,,1285,4.216326530612245
