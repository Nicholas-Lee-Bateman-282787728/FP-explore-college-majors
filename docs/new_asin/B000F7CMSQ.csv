2554180,5,B000F7CMSQ,"This is a drop laughing on the floor funny series for those who like the finest British humor.  I have all the sets 1 thru 5 and have absolutely no regrets!

buy it you'll love it!!!",1156550400,2,182,4.027777777777778
2554181,4,B000F7CMSQ,"I had no see this season when it was aired in Spain but I must say it's quite hilarious. The events continues with more plots more mad plans from British Intelligence carried out by the French Resistance and Rene and always slipping up. I like the fact that both the Germans and the Resistance have the same orders and the Gestapo adds their own orders just to mix events and make more laughs. All the actors are just good with accents,and personal lines. I don't like Mimi the waitress it's character is quite vulgar. I prefer previous one as I miss Captain Hans Gearing Klup line when hailing Hitler.

I hope series 6 don't took too much in releasing from BBC America.

The best UK series with Benny Hill that rocketed in US",1155600000,4,726,4.451127819548872
2554182,5,B000F7CMSQ,"I don't know the story behind why Series 5 contained so many episodes, but all are real classics.  I must admit ALLO ALLO really utilized its serialized (or soap operatic, if you will) format the best during this season.  New characters, like Denise, were introduced and older favorites, like Officer Crabtree, were given more to do.

Speaking of good, old Crabtree, this series features him in one of my favorite scenes of the whole show's run.  Just wait until you hear his rendition of ""Louise"" when Rene and the gang go undercover as a band.  Simply priceless.

This set is more expensive than the others because it's being released in two parts, but it's worth the extra cash if you're a fan of the show or just British comedy in general.",1150675200,7,743,4.633587786259542
2554183,4,B000F7CMSQ,"[THIS JUST IN: I discovered some brief cuts while watching episode #9 (""Watch the Birdie"", where Rene has the apron-camera to photograph the invasion map) on this DVD! A few lines are missing, which I confimed by watching my old tape from the TV broadcast. Why would a cut version ever need to be made? Some American shows' cut versions for syndication have been known to make it (accidentally?) onto DVD; but Allo Allo never played on commercial TV. This is very disappointing, especially as #9 is one of the funniest eps of the season; my rating drops to 3 stars. Still happy to get the 5th season, but now I fear there may be more cuts I haven't noticed yet.]

A correction to the earlier review, which lists the episodes: There are 26 eps in Series 5, not 27...  ""Sausage in the Wardrobe"" is listed mistakenly (that's a Series 3 ep).  The reason there are so many eps in S5, compared with S1-4, is that the producers were making arrangements to air it on American network TV as well as the BBC, hence the full American-length season.  The eps are also 25 min. instead of 30, to allow for commercials in USA.  Those plans fell through, and it only aired in the USA later, like the other series, when various public TV stations bought it.

Series 5 is the last of the great ones, I think.  It starts to falter in places, but also gives us many classic hilarious scenes, including Rene's close call on the millsaw, the apron with the false hand, the wedding, the hospital fiasco, and the whole gang all aboard the Geneva Express.  Curiously, episodes #24 & 25 were not written by Lloyd & Croft (the only such eps in the first 6 series), and it shows.  They are far and away the weakest scripts, their humor simply missing the mark -- a testament to how specific Lloyd & Croft's brand of writing really is.  Detractors of the show would say ""Anyone could write those silly repetitive jokes."" ... I disagree.

Anyway, the actors are wonderful, and aside from Gorden Kaye who so perfectly carries the show, I'd single out Kenneth Connor (Alphonse), Jack Haig (Leclerc), Rose Hill (Fanny), Guy Siner (Gruber), and Richard Gibson (Flick).  But everyone is very funny...  What a great cast.  Join Rene & company for Series 5!",1149465600,,2220,4.55919395465995
2554184,5,B000F7CMSQ,"WOW, did season 5 really go for 27 episodes?  If so this will be fantastic value!  One show that did get better as the series went on, the initial characters just added dimensions.  As I moved to the States in 89 it will be great to see episodes I've never seen before, and more seasons to come!

The Gestapo in stockings and suspenders (either Helga or the classic Flick) is just laugh-out loud!

Now where can I find it aint arf hot mum for more Empire humor......",1147305600,6,466,4.310344827586207
2554185,5,B000F7CMSQ,"Is it not Crazy a British Comedy made by the British Broadcasting Corporation { that is funded by a license fee of over $ 250 per year } will not be available in Britain this Year

Yes I know the old excuse that the USA is a larger market than the UK but as Region 2 Covers

all of Europe { plus Japan, South Africa and the Middle East } one has to wonder which market is Larger.

I do not mind waiting for American Dvd's to be released months later in Britain but it does not make any sense for the BBC to release a British DVD a Good Six Months in the States before they look at the European market.

The British version of 'Allo 'Allo Series 1 -2 -3 and 4 does not Contain any extra's at all

2554187,3,B000F7CMSQ,"There are endearing characters, but some, like the waitresses, are one-joke characters and it's just not funny after a while.  In fact, the only characters who keep being funny are the cafe owner, the main commandant, and the gay lieutenant.  Everyone else has a very narrow range.  Some good jokes on the French and the English stereoptypes.  I just saw series I and II.  Maybe the later ones are better.  It never makes much sense that Rene harps on how stupid his wife it - she's a bad singer, and she acts blind to Rene's flirting with the waitresses, but she seems no less bright than everyone else.  And the old man spy is annoying.  Maybe the people who like this grew up on cliche-ridden WWII dramas, so they have more context than I do.",1146528000,,745,4.466666666666667

Brits doing French is bad enough, but a when Gestapos get funny you are in for a treat. this won't go over too well in Germany, but maybe the young Germans might smile.",1144886400,8,273,4.169811320754717
2554189,5,B000F7CMSQ,"It's nice to know the BBC is at least paying attention to some of the things their customers want.  Thank Heaven they've been releasing 'ALLO, 'ALLO! on a pretty regular basis.  Now, let's just hope they do the same for WAITING FOR GOD.

I'm really looking forward to series five of this show.  Whether there's going to be any bonus material included in this series remains to be seen, but even with out it, it's still a great watch.

The cover art for volume one of the series is a great tribute to the late actor Jack Haig, who sadly passed away on 4 July, 1989.

I also like the fact that the price is going to be much lower thn we first thought.

The one thing I don't like about the bonus material for the series thus far is that they include cast bios in every series.  There were nine series in all, so in my opinion they should have waited until the end of series nine to include them.

I also don't like the fact that series four had no bonus material at all.

Other than these small complaints, I think this is a fantastic addition to anyone's collection of British comedies.",1144195200,19,1085,4.2745098039215685
2554190,5,B000F7CMSQ,"The changing accents for the different languages, the costumes and stereotypical portrayals twisted in an insane out of place comedy.  Only the British could pull this off without being totally offensive to everyone and come up with laugh out loud humor.  This whole series is great and it keeps one guessing how the writers could possibly come up with such twisted and ridiculous situations.  A little naughty, a little drama, and a lot crazy tossed together to make great comedy.",1392249600,,481,4.9875

The Madonna with big boobies and the 2 dumb airmen are downplayed, and instead of them, the Italian captain, the nymphomaniac (""ruthless"") communist resistance and that old bag the undertaker blossom to new heigths.

Lots of smutty jokes and double meaning puns ...of course Rene talks his way out of tricky situations every time. Officer Crabtree still keeps me in stitches with his attempts at French, and Herr Flick and Helga add a little spice.

8118594,5,B000F7CMSQ,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.

Basic story is of a caf owner Ren; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law.

In series five we get more action from the communist resistance; frankly I think the commie resistance has cuter girls and adds some fresh characters to the mix. And be sure to keep your eye on the homing duck.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.",1507075200,,936,4.592814371257485
