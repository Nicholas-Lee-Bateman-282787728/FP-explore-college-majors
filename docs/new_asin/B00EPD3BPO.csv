8607876,4,B00EPD3BPO,"Duress is what I call a payoff film. The film itself isn't all that thrilling although the story line is well thought out and the acting quite good,but the payoff comes at the end of the film in the form of two clever twists that are  revealed.

It's never boring because it does throw in a few thrills along the way as it's bringing you closer to the climactic ending. It really isn't horror but very much a psychological thriller. There is no gore to speak of but instead a few disturbing visuals. I found the ending quite chilling and worth the wait!",1422403200,,553,4.359223300970874

8607880,5,B00EPD3BPO,"WATCHED THIS ON NETFLIX,
WENT STRAIGHT TO AMAZON FOR THE PURCHASE !
UNBELIEVABLE SCRIPT,ACTING,& PLOT !
GREAT MOVIE !
The DVD cover art / film description are misleading and dose not do the film justice !
Not a gory slasher or creature feature but a well written solid piece of film making !
FANTASTIC TWIST ENDING !!!",1407801600,3,318,4.5964912280701755
8607881,4,B00EPD3BPO,"I saw this on Netflx a while back and it just popped up on my Amzn page. I am surprised it only has 2 reviews. This is a very good film that will catch you off guard in the right way. Avoid spoiliers because it will definitely weaken, if not neutralize, the impact and the experience if you know too much going in. Its not a horrorible subgenre flick. Well done across the board, good story and execution.",1403136000,3,405,4.205128205128205
8607882,5,B00EPD3BPO,"My husband actually discovered this movie on Netflix. I am so glad I decided to watch this. I was not expecting the AMAZING TWIST ENDING!! This is an amazing new twist in the horror gene. Finally a movie with AMAZING actor and the child actor was PERFECT, very very good movie. Tons of suspension and thrills and chills with NOT A DROP OF SEX!!!",1388707200,2,345,4.40625
8607883,4,B00EPD3BPO,"A good little thriller with an excellent performance by Martin Donavan. Anything more would be a spoiler. Not much gore, a lot of tension.",1387497600,,138,4.791666666666667
