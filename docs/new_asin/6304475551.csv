7872117,5,6304475551,"National Geographic's ""The Rhino War,"" is a gripping story of the intensive efforts undertaken in the late twentieth century to save the rhino in Africa.  As a scientific documentary it is comprehensive and factual, but it is also undergirded by a strong appeal to the emotions and ethics of humankind.  Complete with breathtaking imagery, offset by the dusty reality of modern wildlife management, the film is both beautiful and pertinent; even now, in a new century, the Black Rhino faces many of the challenges it did then.  (And considering the current political situation in Zimbabwe, it isn't hard to imagine a revival of the conflict.)  Nonetheless, the program offers a glimpse into a time of literal bloodshed--a time when conservation in Africa reached an unprecidented level of desperation.  ""The Rhino War"" is moving and informative--a tribute to a magnificent animal and those willing to fight for it.",1069891200,4,914,5.190476190476191
