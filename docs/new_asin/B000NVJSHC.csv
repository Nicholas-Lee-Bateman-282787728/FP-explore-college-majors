2784314,2,B000NVJSHC,"Tony Comstock's films are labeled ""Real People, Real Life, Real Sex.""  While the ""real people"" and ""real sex"" lines are true, the ""real life"" ... well, that's not entirely the case, and that comes into play with his second film ""Xana and Dax.""

Xana is a buxom, tattooed and pierced Midwestern blonde; Dax, eight years her junior, is a slim dark Brazilian.  Like Comstock's other films, the first part is the couple talking about what got them together and what they love about each other; the second part is a admittedly erotic sex scene.  Unlike Comstock's other films, which seem to invite the viewer into the couple's bedroom, Xana and Dax's sex scenes take place on a dark set with a brightly lit white bed.  If you Google ""Xana and Dax"" you will quickly learn that, as the couple in Comstock's first film ""Marie and Jack"" were, they are porn actors, with the difference being that they don't deal with any outside actors (unless, as per Xana's website, you count women for girl-on-girl scenes).  While it's obvious they're a couple, there are also more of the conventional porn elements in this film compared to Comstock's other films, namely Xana's physical appearance, which may be offputting for some viewers.  Although this was the Comstock film that ""O"" magazine raved about, I would be hesitant to show this to the adult film neophyte.  While ""Xana and Dax"" is miles above your average porn in quality, it's not Comstock's best.",1189468800,22,1440,4.801619433198381
2784315,5,B000NVJSHC,"Comstock has developed a truly enjoyable formula. The disc begins with the couple talking to an unseen interviewer. They summarize the history of their relationship briefly but spend a good bit more time talking about each other - their real love for each other, and especially for each other's bodies comes across throughout. It's something I know and value in my own life, the sense of beauty that deepens with affection. It would be easy to look at one or the other and see nothing special, until you see each through the other's eyes. My own beloved is an enchanting beauty, to me, but her beauty seems hidden in plain sight from almost everyone else.

Scenes in the interview alternate with sequences from the bedroom, illustrating points they make in the interview and setting a happily erotic mood. Then, about halfway through the disc, we switch completely to the bedroom. For the next twenty minutes or so, we follow this loving couple from their initial caresses and undressings, through the full heat of their lovemaking, to a warm, lazy moment at the very end. If you've been turned off by other ""adult movies,"" the pervasive sense of affection and play will be a pleasant change. You may also enjoy the feeling that loving people don't have to meet some standard of plastic perfection - just being a regular person is pretty special, to someone who loves you. I don't know how to describe the tone of the movie, but I feel as if a nice couple with something to share has invited me over for a special evening. That very last frame, when Xana gazes dreamily into the camera, seems to say that she's glad that you, the viewer, could be part of what's so wonderful between them. I am grateful to them for their gentle, generous offer.

2784316,5,B000NVJSHC,"Tony Comstock is the creater and master of a new genre of films:  explicit couples' sexuality documentaries.  Comstock states that ""intent to arouse"" is often cited as the dividing line between art and porn.  Of all the emotions a director might hope to induce in an audience, arousal remains the last taboo, and Tony Comstock takes it head-on.

In Comstock's award-winning Xana and Dax:  When Opposites Attract, he stays true to his mission of showing flesh in the context of intimacy and love.  The conversation between husband and wife is in many ways more revealing than the pure sex, as the two discuss their initial attraction, personal turn-ons, secret desires, and intimate moments.  In this case, Xana, the pale blonde with a gorgeous full-color back piece, is the older and more experienced of the two.  Brazilian Dax is shyer about his sexuality and reveals some of his early fears about his body hair and lovemaking style.

The DVD is straightforward and to-the-point.  The first half consists of a conversation with Xana and Dax, with brief segments from their lovemaking style interspersed within the narrative.  The second half is an uninterrupted bedroom session (outtakes from which are what add spice to the first half of the move).  The viewer is a part of their bedroom, and at no time does it appear that the director has interrupted to give them any cinematic tips.  This is raw and intimate, beautifully shot, with no exaggeration or acting.

This is recommended along with the other Comstock Films advertised on the DVD.  Just watch the outtakes and you'll be rushing out to purchase Marie & Jack (Comstock's first film, with married pornographic actors), Damon & Hunter (a male gay couple), Ashley & Kisha (a female lesbian couple), and Matt & Khym (a 30-something married couple).",1175558400,38,1806,4.973333333333334
2784317,5,B000NVJSHC,"In teaming up with filmmaker, Tony Comstock, Xana and Dax get to tell us their love story and show us their lovemaking. It's a beautiful and delightfully sexy tale, just like a good love story should be, and exactly the kind of story I love.

There's Xana -- all blonde, creamy smooth skin and lovely curves and then there's her handsome, dark haired, Brazilian husband, Dax -- she's a little bold -- he's a little shy -- on the surface they do indeed appear to be opposites, but as we hear their story, we learn just how close and complementary they truly are. When we see them make love, it's confirmed without a doubt. These two enjoy themselves with the unhurried grace of a couple who've come to know each other well, with the assured, confident moves of soul mates who know what it takes to turn each other on and with the ease of real life lovers whose motivation is pure pleasure. Their pleasure quickly becomes ours.

In making a film that lets the lovers shine, Tony Comstock allows some of that warmth to spill over onto us. The filmmaker seems to indulge the viewer, wanting us to see everything he sees and much more -- it's a generous kind of filmmaking that presents sex in an elegantly explicit but almost defiantly straightforward way.

The DVD is a very good looking production from the box cover, disc titles, the clear, simple and easy to navigate menu to the paragraphs of text that introduce and provide context for the clips that follow. There are four extended trailers included for the other currently available Comstock Films Marie & Jack: A Hardcore Love Story,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damon-and-Hunter-Doing-It-Together-Real-People-Real-Life-Real-Sex-series/dp/B000NJLX54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damon and Hunter: Doing It Together (Real People, Real Life, Real Sex series)</a>Ashley & Kisha: The Right Fit, and Matt & Khym: Better Than Ever.

Xana and Dax is a very sexy love story -- one that starts sparks flying in our household regularly. I recommend it highly.",1174003200,22,2048,5.159638554216867
2784318,5,B000NVJSHC,"Xana and Dax is a great film for couples . . . but don't get it just for that reason.  It is a beautifully filmed display of personal connection and lovemaking.  The heat between these two is what I wish for everyone.

This graphic film is quite satisfying, and I am glad to see Amazon offer this very healthy and entertaining DVD.  I am thankful to see sex and love be accepted in this day where we flip TV channels only to see people maimed and killed for entertainment's sake.

Comstock Films is a big part of changing the world for the better.  Buy it for a friend.",1173398400,16,569,4.222222222222222

8181752,3,B000NVJSHC,"Their discussion of their attraction for one another is open, honest and refreshing to hear.  Their lovemaking is rather quiet and not all that imaginative, hence not all that exciting (to us; you may feel diferently).",1356220800,,218,5.055555555555555
8181753,1,B000NVJSHC,"Did not like it. Couple played it on camera and it did not seem like they enjoy the process either. Anyway, did not work for me.",1284940800,3,128,3.9615384615384617
8181754,5,B000NVJSHC,"Xana is the pagan goddess: voluptuous, tattooed, pierced and blond; while Dax is carved Mahogany, mocha-skinned, lean and agile.  Xana is more experienced and leads Dax through sexual exploration, while Dax is shy and just beginning to build his self-confidence as a lover.

The interview is juxtaposed with snippets of the lovemaking session to follow, which builds slowly towards the climax.  I really enjoyed watching the interview, as it allows you to get to know the couple a little, before they invite you to share their intimate moment.

The lovemaking is slow and sensual, as they anoint each other with massage oil as if it were a sacred ritual.  You can see how much they adore each other and take pleasure in each other's bodies.  Their passion is very hedonistic and filled with dreamy reverence and moments of dizzying ecstasy.

The camera moves in and around them like an extension of their desire, never obtrusive, and you get the feeling that you are sharing their experience.  They are beautiful, sexy and hot to watch.

Ultimately, Xana and Dax, like Comstock's other films, delivers a much more fulfilling portrayal of sexual desire and intimacy than what you see in the mundane monotony of mainstream adult films.  I highly recommend Xana and Dax for couples to share together.",1240704000,3,1297,4.962962962962963
8181755,2,B000NVJSHC,"So far I've watched two of Tony Comstock's films:  this one and Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever.  I recommend the latter over this one.  I really like the concept of filming ""real"" couples who are in love having sex, as emotional intimacy can be even more erotic than just physical intimacy.

However, this movie felt very staged, like a stereotypical adult film sans the comedic entertainment value.  This feeling was exacerbated by the sometimes ridiculous camera angles chosen by the filmmaker and the fact the shooting angle seemed to switch every minute.  The shots I found to be erotic didn't last long enough for me to appreciate them fully.

I would not purchase this movie again.",1194566400,7,688,4.829059829059829
8181756,5,B000NVJSHC,"Xana is gorgeous.  Dax is beautiful.  The chemistry between them is undeniable.  Sexier than 99.9% of of the porn I've seen, and damn if I haven't seen a whole lotta porn.

This would be an excellent choice for both porn neophytes and old-timers.",1194480000,10,246,4.651162790697675
8181757,5,B000NVJSHC,"I was hesitant to buy Xana and Dax to watch with my wife for obvious reasons.  Watching an erotic film seems like it should be a fun way to get things going, but the few times we've tried it we ended up just feeling dirty and sad.  Xana and Dax was just SPECTACULAR.  It delivered in every way - the story was sweet, the sex was hot and it left us both in a frisky mood and ready to have fun!  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add some spark to their relationship!",1189641600,12,474,3.957894736842105
