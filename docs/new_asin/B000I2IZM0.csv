8143191,3,B000I2IZM0,It's okay but fun to watch at Christmas time. I bought it from Amazon for 7.50 with a double feature Christmas in Paradise. Had to have it for my collection.,1498608000,,157,4.266666666666667
8143192,3,B000I2IZM0,"Movie was slow, but cute. I only bought it because one of my 2 favorite actors are in it, Steven Culp. I was told movie wouldn't play on my DVD because I needed a certain type of DVD player, but it plays fine.",1457222400,,209,3.883720930232558
8143193,4,B000I2IZM0,Great holiday movie to enjoy with family and friends.  I purchased this movie for myself to enjoy for Christmas.  This movie is not played often at Christmas on T.V.!,1357084800,,166,4.689655172413793
8143194,5,B000I2IZM0,"I was wondering why someone posted a comment about being ""careful"" about this dvd not playing in a U.S. dvd player.  I am about to purchase this dvd and I live in the U.S. and always assumed that if the seller put Region 1 (U.S.) that it would play in all u.s. dvd players.  Am I wrong?",1296000000,,286,4.0
8143195,5,B000I2IZM0,Great heartwarming movie.  Great story for the holiday season.  Enjoy watching every year and wanted to make sue I got it on DVD so I can watch whenever I want.,1267574400,2,160,4.3
8143196,2,B000I2IZM0,"You don't see the part that says, ""Will not play on US DVD Players"" until you look around a bit.  You may wind up wasting $60 like I did.",1221782400,2,137,3.7241379310344827
8143197,5,B000I2IZM0,Any vehicle in which talented Steven Culp appears has merit.  Mr. Culp portrays Dr. Kirk Olsen to the fullness of Kirk's personality and actions and adds a tad more (Mr. Culp's work ethic) than the script requires.  This remains a fine Christmas (Winter Holiday) film.,1209168000,2,268,4.933333333333334
