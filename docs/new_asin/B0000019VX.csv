7901994,5,B0000019VX,"In assessing this video of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"", one, for starters, has to come to grips with Pierre Boulez' contribution to what is the most gloriously lyrical yet still dramatically involved conducting of the work that I have ever heard in a post-W.W. II recording (aside from just barely post-war with Furtwaengler conducting his studio recording, truly essential to have in any sound collection of Wagner). Boulez' approach, however, for all its lyricism, is not lolly-popped up or flattened out blandly as Karajan might have done it on at least some occasions, but is deeply perceptive, especially into Wagner's ""compositional workshop"", as it were, and probes deeply. The music in the last act never has been allowed to sound so weirdly modern, convincingly so, to my ears as, it does in this video performance (and that is praise, not censure). Boulez works miracles with Wagner's score. Wonderful, really, beyond telling! The conducting truly is a marvel in its own right, quite apart from the superb cast.

The visual aspect of this VHS document, however, which has been the case for its reappearance on DVD, too, is far less than ideal. The black and white images on screen vary from just adequate to execrable in technical quality. As for the like visual problems of the DVD reissues, this surely is due to Premiere Opera (DVD-5730 still to be had as of mid-2016) and incarnations prior to DVD on VHS tape, like the the same enterprises' Legato Classics label, having made resort, probably as well, to the VHS tape that Bel Canto Society released, itself no longer to obtain to be had even from B.C.S.  Without considerable image enhancement, DVDs done without that kind of quality control from VHS sources usually suffer in quality and are inferior to the source, so, if one can do so, obtain the Bel Canto VHS. The resulting screen quality on any of these products can annoy at bit, especially when faces blur too much, but I don't care a hoot about how that affects the staging itself, which is Wieland-Wagner-dreadful, ugly, ungainly, and only makes touch with the action pretty undiscernibly a lot of the time.

The costumes, for their part, are hideous. This opera's action and setting are based on Mediaeval Celtic culture, the characters depicted hailing from Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany. One would think that just at least a teensy-weensy bit of Celtic folklore motifs and charm in the dresses that Isolde and Brangaene wear would be welcome. Nope! Isolde wears some awful leathery get-up in act one and then, in the subsequent acts, looks like she is dressed in the bland uniform of a women's prison matron. That tremendous bustiness look of Nilsson's femal physique comes through, gratefully unimpeded, as clad in both costumes which she wears. Brangaene's outfit looks only a bit less mod-gothic. All of this Bayreuth semi-abstract grotesquery is on view, in this recorded performance, as the Bayreuth production appeared at the Osaka Festival, in Japan, in 1967 (on April 10 of that year, and surely not in 1969 as Premiere Opera's DVD release, for example of the same performance states).

Nilsson's whole look and character, despite the horrid costumes, transform from the vituperative outbursts of the wildcat fiery wench, of Wagner's text and music of the first act, to subside to give place to a woman deeply -- and I mean head-over-heels-in-love -- for the remainder of the opera once she and Tristan have imbibed the love potion That stark (and welcome) contrast does not even need costuming to highlight the difference. Nilsson always (well, nearly so) was incredibly vivid and robustly beautiful as a woman in love, and that is the case here, too. It is incredible how a woman of such unpromising street-level looks can thus transform herself on stage, as I have seen her do just that live (i.e., as in being ""THERE"") in the opera house onstage.

All of that is of no account (well, not downright damagingly so, as the like could be with a lesser cast!). For all of the coarse staging and costuming, the sound itself is really rather good and the singing of the cast members is heavenly beyond belief. For staters, the Tristan is the great Wolfgang Windgassen, sounding more natural of voice (and the same applies to Nilsson) than in the D.G.G. studio recording on LP or CD which Karl Bhm recorded in the studio for D.G.G. (not to be confused with D.G.G.'s video recording on DVD, also conducted by Bhm, with Nilsson's Isolde partnered by Jon Vickers' Tristan), probably because the voices on the purely sound recording were not recorded too close to microphone placement at Osaka. Windgassen, too, while not a truly handsome guy, did look like a human male of the species, unlike the hefty barnyard livestock look of the likes of Jon Vickers or Ben Heppner in the role. Windgassen's acting during Tristan's delirium in the last act is disturbingly intense, expressionist almost.

Much the same goes for Birgit Nilsson as Isolde, whose acting radiates romantic ardour and who sings much more sweetly and grandly beautifully as Isolde, as already mentioned, than, she usually has been heard on sound recordings and videos, without the distortion or exaggeration that would result from the usual close mic-ing that tends to mar her work in record company studios. As for Hertha Tpper, she is the best mezzo-soprano, vocally speaking, in the role of Brangaene that off hand I recall hearing since the legendary pre-war recordings in which Karen Branzell took part. I had not realised before just what a fine singer Tpper really was! She keeps pace magnificently with Nilsson (as Windgassen in his role also does so), and that says quite a lot on behalf of anybody, this side of eternity.

A special treat is seeing Hans Hotter, the great German bass whose voice was of such burnished ebony hue, as King Marke. Wow! No wonder audiences loved this singing actor so intensely! His imposing bearing and intense stage presence, even when he does not move around much, are overwhelming. By 1969 his voice was fraying audibly, but that dark black sound was there and, allied to a stage presence of such grandeur, he is thrilling, even in vocal decline (but of still magnificently virile physique).

I was in a state of complete rapture, totally in another realm altogether, as this DVD came to a close. Appropriately, however surprisingly, as the last chord barely had faded into silence, as though on cue, the first thunderous boom of a local festival's fireworks sounded and then, back to the screen and recorded sound, came the Japanese audience's ecstatic ovation for the performance. Lady Happenstance-Chance agreed with the pleasure that I found in this opera video! Then ensued, also appropriately and seemingly on cue, the best fireworks display that I ever have seen in ""my neck of the woods"" to cap, so inadvertently and so fittingly, that evening devoted to viewing this video of Wagner's tremendous work of art.",1471996800,,6966,4.942783945345858
7901995,3,B0000019VX,"Well, the video quality is awful and the production is completely static with wooden acting which would be totally unacceptable by today's standards. However, the sound is good and Boulez conducts with great energy and sensitivity. Above all, we get to experience Birgit Nilsson in her prime in, perhaps, her second most famous role (Brunnhilde being number one). I saw her sing this role at the Met in the '60s. She is incomparable; there is no other dramatic soprano since her who even compares. Her voice is truly unique, a totally secure, ringing top and a luscious midrange. Windgassen is an ok Tristan, but he is sometimes a bit shaky in his midrange. I prefer Jon Vickers in this role.",1389052800,,692,4.775
7901996,4,B0000019VX,"I have the Legato Classics video. Whereas Pierre Boulez's recordings of Parsifal and of the Ring are readily available, his performance of Tristan is largely unknown. At Bayreuth during the 1960's from the death of Knappertbusch Boulez conducted Parsifal. During this period Tristan was conducted by Karl Bohm however for the performance here Boulez took the helm. The sound on this video is surprisingly good;  it is also available as a CD on the Opera Depot label. The visual quality is another matter. It is in dim black and white without subtitles. If one can bear staring through the gloom what can be seen is a performance of such immediacy, wild passion, energy as one may ever encounter. It may be the only readily available film of Wolfgang Wagner's production of Tristan. Whilst it might be preferable to have had Karl Bohn in the pit, this performance is one of very considerable interest. The tape should be issued on DVD, remastered and with subtites added. 4 stars not 5 because of the visuals. It is still  worth keeping tne video player.",1354665600,2,1053,4.8121546961325965
