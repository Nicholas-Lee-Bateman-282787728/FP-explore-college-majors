2942354,1,B000VKL6Z2,"As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.

The problem with this ""Halloween"" is:

1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from ""Devil's Rejects"" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.

2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.

In the original, the grown up Michael was known as ""The Shape"", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.

3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to ""God Of Thunder"", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.

4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! ""Rest in Peace""? You bet.

5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, ""What do I do now?""

6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is ""Halloween"" not ""High School Musical"".

7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E's ""Cold Case File"" or ""American Justice"". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.

8. The ending. Absolute bull***t.

Stick with Carpenter's eternal classic, because next Halloween this remake will be forgotten, like last years autumn leaves",1188691200,15,2668,4.480412371134021
2942355,3,B000VKL6Z2,"It's hard to recommend this new version of Halloween because it's brutal and disturbing but well acted and well made. The body count increased incredibly in this remake. I can't even count how many people died in the movie.

  The movie is creepy and scary and despite how awfully violent it is I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I might need therapy for that reason though. This is probably the most insane movie I have seen, well next to Devil's Rejects anyway. Rob Zombie is a good director but.....the movie is a bit over done. We didn't need the body count to be even bigger this time around.

  Seeing person after person die brutally tends to get tiresome and hard to watch and it even holds the movie down from being great. There's a little too many un-needed killings in the movie. Rob Zombie went all out when he really didn't have to. He loses focus on the main story by having sooo many side characters brutally murdered.

  The movie is gripping especially at the end but the beginning drags on too long and is a bit depressing despite a creepy performance by the kid who plays young Michael. Sarah Moon also does good work as his mother and you feel bad for her since she clearly loves her child who broke her heart by going all psycho. Rob Zombie pulls off giving us a film that's a bit different, so if you are avoiding it because you feel as if you seen it already, don't avoid it for that reason. You might want to avoid it due to being so over the top violent though.",1188691200,2,1483,4.324909747292419
2942356,4,B000VKL6Z2,"There may be nothing in the world Rob Zombie could have done with this remake of the slasher masterpiece, HALLOWEEN, to outdo John Carpenter's original. The first, and best, HALLOWEEN took its audience by total surprise, and its subtletey continues to impress, especially now, in this age of excess, instant gratification, and horror gore. Having said that, the new HALLOWEEN is, by far, more frightening than any of the HALLOWEEN SEQUELS--and, yes, I am including Part II in that assessment.

You can count me in on the large crowd that clamored and complained that HALLOWEEN didn't need remaking. I still think that. Rob Zombie was evidently conscious of this sentiment, too, because he went very far to make this movie his own. There are significant departures from the original storyline, which was powered by its very mystery and its unapologetically unexplainable boogeyman. By contrast, Zombie explains everything--and he makes you watch everything, too; not in the comfortable, established, Hollywood-safe method of bloodletting (watch any of the FRIDAY movies for examples of this), but in brutal, painful-to-watch murder scenes that are, at times, deliciously tortuous to endure.

Some will say they don't want to know WHY Michael is what he is. He's more frightening because we DON'T get him. Okay. That's true. However, these explanations take up a lot of Zombie's movie, and whatever one may say about the strengths of the original, these are probably the most horrifying scenes in the film. Watching ten-year-old Michael take out everyone in his family other than his mother and little sister--using duct tape, a baseball bat, and, of course, a butcher knife--was the most disturbing thing I'd seen since HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.

What I missed most from the original was Donald Pleasance. I thought the replacement for Jamie Lee Curtis was actually the only real improvement the movie had on the original (and I just know that most people will disagree with me on that, but what the heck); but Malcolm McDowell is astonishingly weak in his portrayal of Dr. Loomis. Strange ... Going in, he was the only one I really had confidence in.

It's impossible not to compare. You can't simply take the movie on its own merit, and when a filmmaker decides to remake a classic, he opens himself up to that unpleasantness. Even if you are coming to HALLOWEEN for the first time, you've been exposed to it through its paltry imitations and sequels. Ranked up against them, this HALLOWEEN is a fine, frightening tour de force.

2942357,5,B000VKL6Z2,"When I first heard about Rob Zombie writing and directing the remake to John Carpenter's HALL0WEEN, I immediately knew that the film was gonna be incredible. I am a major fan of Michael Myers and the entire HALLOWEEN series, so you ought to believe how excited I was to see this film when Rob Zombie had finished it. Little did I know that this remake was even more incredible than I had anticipated. I was expecting a great remake, and what I saw was not great; it was fu*BEEP*ing outstanding. Rob Zombie went into a completely different direction with his remake, a direction so different that this remake does the original film so much more justice.

The film starts on Halloween, introducing MICHAEL MYERS (played by Daeg Faerch) , a troubled ten year old boy. In his room, Michael admires Elvis, a pet rat, while wearing a clown mask. Downstairs, his mother DEBORAH MYERS (played by Sherri Moon Zombie, Rob Zombie's sexy wife) argues with her crippled boyfriend RONNIE WHITE (played by William Forsythe) and Michael's sister JUDITH MYERS (played by Hannah R. Hall). Michael, in the bathroom washing a small bloody knife, is called downstairs by Judith. Ronnie berates him, teasing him for wearing masks all the time. Later at school, Michael is confronted by WESLEY RHODES (played by Daryl Sabara), a bully, and his friend. Wesley teases Michael, threatening to make copies of a newspaper advertisement for The Rabbit in Red, a strip club where Michael's mother works. A fight ensues and Deborah is called into the school to speak with DR. SAMUEL J. LOOMIS (played by Malcolm McDowell), a child psychologist. Loomis wants to evaluate Michael, after the school found a dead cat and numerous photographs of dead animals in Michael's backpack. Michael, overhearing the conversation, leaves the office and follows Wesley Rhodes into the woods. Donning his clown mask, Michael brutally beats the bully with a sturdy tree branch. While Wesley begs for mercy, Michael finds the advertisement in his coat pocket. He takes it before murdering Rhodes.

At home, Ronnie and Michael are watching a movie on television as Deborah is about to leave for work. Before leaving, she tells Michael that every thing will be better soon. She leaves, and Judith is left to take Michael trick-or-treating. However, Judith's boyfriend STEVE shows up, canceling Michael's trick-or-treat plans. Ronnie falls asleep on the couch, leaving Steve and Judith to have sex in her room. Michael, again donning his clown mask, proceeds to duct tape Ronnie to the couch, where Michael then violently slits Ronnie's throat. Upstairs, Steve and Judith finish having sex, and he puts on the infamous William Shatner mask, wanting to have sex with the mask on. Judith refuses, and Steve goes downstairs to make some food. While in the kitchen, Michael sneaks up on Steve and bludgeons him with an aluminum baseball bat. With Judith asleep upstairs, Michael finds and puts on the white mask. He enters Judith's room, and places his hand on her leg. Mistaking him for Steve, Judith turns and questions the silent Michael, slapping him. He then stabs her in the stomach with a kitchen knife. As she stumbles through the halls of the house, Michael follows, stabbing her a total of seventeen times. He then enters the baby's room and takes her out to the porch. Deborah returns home from work, finding Michael and the baby on the porch. The police arrive, and Michael is taken into custody.

Eleven months later, Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Loomis. In recorded therapy sessions with Loomis, Michael claims to not remember anything about killing. As Deborah has weekly visitation rights, Michael now creates and wears masks at all times. By Christmas, Loomis and Michael are screaming at each other. Eventually, Michael stops talking. During a visit, Deborah gives Michael a picture of him holding his baby sister. Moments later, as Loomis is about to walk Deborah to her car, Michael stabs an overseeing nurse in the throat with a fork. At the Myers home, Deborah is watching old home movies of Michael, crying. She then proceeds to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head.

Fifteen years later, Loomis tells a 27-year-old MICHAEL MYERS (played by Tyler Mane), who hasn't said a word in 15 years, that he is no longer going to be his psychologist. That same night, Smith's Grove plans on transferring Michael to a maximum security prison. Before the asylum police can transfer him, Michael kills them, and eventually the majority of the Smith's Grove staff. He escapes, and runs into a truck driver named Big Joe Grizzley. Michael confronts him in the bathroom, and kills him, stealing his coveralls. Michael completes his journey by returning to his home. Under the floorboards, he finds the knife with which he murdered his family, and the white William Shatner mask, now tarnished and dirty.

The story shifts to that of LAURIE STRODE (played by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie is living a happy life with her parents, CYNTHIA STRODE (played by Dee Wallace) and MASON STRODE (played by Pat Skipper). As she heads off to school, Laurie is met by TOMMY DOYLE (played by Skyler Gosondo), a boy she babysits. They pass the old Myers home, where Laurie must drop off an envelope for her father. Tommy warns her not to go near the house, as the boogeyman lives there. Laurie toys with Tommy, while Michael watches from inside the house. At school, Laurie and her best friends, ANNIE BRACKETT (played by Danielle Harris) and LYNDA van der KLOK (played by Kristina Klebe), make plans for Halloween night as Laurie notices Michael watching her from outside. Annie convinces Laurie to babysit for her that night, so Annie can meet with her boyfriend Paul. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield to find the Myers's gravestone missing and the grave vandalized with a crucified animal carcass. On the way home from school, Laurie notices Michael again, and Lynda and Annie mock him. Annie is picked up by her father, LEE BRACKETT (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, the killer doll), the town sheriff, who offers Annie a ride home. Lynda also eventually leaves, and Laurie is followed home by Michael. That evening, Laurie leaves her home with Annie to babysit at Tommy's house. After they leave, Michael murders the Strode family. Michael then returns to his house, only to find Lynda and her boyfriend, BOB SIMMS (played by Mick Mennell), having sex. Bob leaves the living room to get more beer, and is met halfway back by Michael, who impales him to a wall with his knife. Michael puts a sheet over his head while wearing Bob's glasses. Lynda mistakes Michael for Bob, and as she turns around, Michael strangles her to death.

At the Doyle house, Annie leaves Lindsey Wallace with Laurie and Tommy. Annie then returns home to be with her boyfriend PAUL (played by Max van Ville). While they have sex, Michael comes and murders Paul, while severely beating Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett, convinced by Loomis that Michael is in Haddonfield, is searching the town in his patrol car. He tells Loomis that he responded to the 9-1-1 call for Deborah Myers's suicide. He found the young baby sister, but did not want her to grow up knowing what happened to her family. He took her to a foster home, where she was adopted by the Strode family.

Laurie heads back to the Wallace home to take by Lindsey, when they two find the bodies of Paul and Annie. Paul is dead, hung from the ceiling rafters with a jack o' lantern on his head, while Annie is severely injured, but alive. Laurie tells Lindsey to go back to Tommy's house, while she calls 9-1-1. As Lindsey leaves, Michael, who was hiding behind the door, shuts it, and begins to chase Laurie. Laurie outruns Michael to the Doyle house, and she and the children look themselves in a room. As police officers arrive, Michael kills the officers, breaks into the bathroom and takes Laurie. Loomis and Brackett, responding to Laurie's 9-1-1 call, finally arrive at Lindsey's house to find Annie still alive on the floor. Loomis leaves, only to see Tommy and Lindsey, screaming in the street. They tell him where Michael went, and Loomis follows, armed with a .357 Magnum handgun.

Laurie awakes in the Myers house, next to the gravestone of Judith Myers and the naked body of Lynda. Michael enters, placing his knife on the ground and taking off his mask. He kneels down and offers Laurie his picture of them as children. Laurie cries and tells him she doesn't understand, but then reaches for the knife and stabs Michael in the shoulder. Laurie slips away, but Michael corners her after she falls into a drained swimming pool. Loomis appears and shoots Michael three times. He falls, evidently dead. Loomis gets Laurie inside the police car, where Laurie asks, ""Was that the boogeyman?"" Loomis responds, ""As a matter of fact, I do believe that was."" Michael suddenly breaks through the window and grabs Laurie. Loomis chases after them, and tells Michael he was the one who failed by giving up on him. Michael lets Laurie go, and grabs Loomis, crushing his skull.

Laurie hides inside the Myers house as Michael drags Loomis's body inside. Michael searches for Laurie, smashing the frail walls. Laurie grabs Loomis's gun, and hides in the attic. Michael then grabs a plank of wood, and begins bashing it through the ceiling. Laurie nearly escapes, but falls through the ceiling into a bedroom. Michael enters the room, and as she raises the gun, he charges at her sending both through the second story window to the ground below. Laurie comes to, lying on top of an unconscious Myers and attempts to shoot him, but the first few shots are empty. Michael recovers, grabbing Laurie's hand as she shoots again. The gun fires, hitting Michael in the head. Laurie, covered with blood, screams in terror as the film abruptly cuts to credits.

  As I said before, Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 Horror classic, is simply outstanding. I was expecting a great remake, but this outstanding was not what I had expected. Out of all the Horror movies that were remade in the last few years, this is the best out of them all.",1188518400,4,10173,4.850316637881405
2942358,5,B000VKL6Z2,"The writing was on the wall. The past twenty years have seen remakes of such beloved horror classics like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""The Omen,"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; because of that, I guess the idea of remaking John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" was not so far fetched, after all. Of course, that got everyone wondering: Can this new version in any way, shape, or form live up to expectations? Having seen it, I can say without a doubt that the answer is yes. Quite frankly, this is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen, updating the original story into a dark, gritty, and stylistic fright fest. As far as remakes are concerned, I'd say that this is in the same league as John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or Marcus Nispel's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

Taking the reigns from Carpenter is Rob Zombie, who's first movie--""House of 1,000 Corpses""--gave the horror genre a rejuvenating boost. While the film itself was unfocused and derivative, it's style was eye catching; watching it, I knew that, if given the right material, Zombie would be the skillful horror filmmaker he set out to be. He's lived up to that potential with ""Halloween,"" a film that does a masterful job of updating--but not rehashing--the original 1978 film. Carpenter's version was brilliant in its ability to build tension, keeping masked madman Michael Myers hidden in shadow, having him strike at just the right moments. Zombie's version is also brilliant, but not in the same way: he gives the film a primal edge that perfectly captures the rage and evil that is Michael Myers.

This is a good thing, especially since Zombie has created a much more compelling and understandable Michael Myers back-story, beginning in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. As a ten-year-old boy (Daeg Faerch), Myers was disturbed, showing psychopathic behavior by hurting and killing animals. He also lived in a troubled household, with a verbally abusive stepfather (William Forsythe) and an uncaring, promiscuous older sister (Hanna Hall). The only person he loved--the only person who loved him back--was his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie), who earned a living as an exotic dancer. Everything changed fifteen years ago, on Halloween night; in a fit of rage, Myers savagely murdered his stepfather, his sister, and her boyfriend (both of whom refused to take him Trick-or-Treating).

Eleven months later, Myers was institutionalized at the Smith Grove Sanitarium and put under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). He noticed how disconnected the boy was from the world, seeming unaware of what he did, continuously covering his face with masks made out of paper and crayon. The murder of a nurse permanently closed him off, leaving his mother heartbroken and Loomis baffled.

The story then flashes forward to the present day. Now in his mid-twenties, Myers (Tyler Mane) is mute and obsessed with wearing masks. After learning that Loomis plans to stop all forms of therapy, Myers uses unnatural physical strength to escape during a patient transfer. His attacks are savage, using violence that's quick, raw, unnerving, and ultimately bloody (it should be noted that the aftermath of every murder is far gorier than anything seen in Carpenter's original film). After killing a truck driver in a rest stop bathroom and stealing his jumpsuit, Myers heads back to Haddonfield on Halloween, taking residence in his abandoned childhood home and covering his face with a dirty white mask hidden beneath the floor.

From here, the film effectively pays homage to many of the original film's subtler nuances. We meet Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends Lynda (Kristina Klebe) and Annie (Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Strode in the fourth and fifth ""Halloween"" sequels). The three are typical high school girlfriends: popular, pretty, and boy-crazy. Both Laurie and Annie spend Halloween night babysitting, which introduces us to young Lindsay (Jenny Gregg Stewart) and Tommy (Skyler Gisondo). Like the Tommy of the original film, this new Tommy is curious about the Boogyman, so much so that it begins to annoy Laurie.

As the film draws to a close, it becomes a taut, suspenseful ride, pitting the unlucky teenagers--primarily Laurie--against an incurable killing machine. If you haven't seen the original films, then I can't tell you why Laurie becomes his target; let's just say that the two are somehow connected. They play against each other during the final scenes, all of which crescendo to screaming heights. Zombie did not hold back in his attempts to frighten the audience, which is appropriate given the kind of film ""Halloween"" is. Just as Carpenter's original version defined the Teen Slasher film, Zombie's version defines creative reinterpreting; he took a well-established story and gave it some fresh blood, resulting in a frightening new film that respectfully pays tribute to its source (example: the inclusion of the original ""'Halloween' Theme""). If you appreciate the art of horror filmmaking, then Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the movie for you.",1188518400,11,5108,5.1704957678355505
2942359,4,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, I'm not sure this movie was worth four stars. It's more like 3.5, but considering that isn't an option, I'd rather give it half more than half less. Rob Zombie has made three movies in his career as a writer/director. The first was the cartoonishly over-the-top, ""sadistic"" (it wasn't) 'House of 1,000 Corpses', the highlight of which was Rainn Wilson as ""Fish Boy"". His second was 'The Devil's Rejects', an indirect sequel (meaning all it had in common was the same characters and actors) to 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. While 'Corpses' was more focused on being weird (the Dr. Satan underground climax; the apparently supernatural monsters), 'The Devil's Rejects' was focused on being an actual movie. The cartoonishness was gone, replaced by actually sadistic violence, likeable villains, and one of the most vile rape scenes but to film. Among all of that, it was a throwback to movies of the same genre from the 1970's. Zombie also directed one of the fake previews in the movie 'Grindhouse', though his, 'Werewold Women of the SS', was the second worst of the lot.

I am in no way a horror fan. Usually all the movies are the same, and there hasn't been an actual good horror movie for several decades. But Zombie's movies are different than the normal ""gross before scary"" horror being released in droves every weekend. That's why it was such a dissapointment, to me at least, that, among other admirable qualities, his 'Halloween' remake has very few chills. It's almost a normal slice-'n-dice horror movie, complete with naked women running around getting fileted for most of the third act.

The first two acts, both of which seriously deviate from the original 1978 classic, gives a back story on serial killer Michael Myers, which seriously deafens the impact of most of the terror later in the movie, the terror that was so present in the original. The biggest mistake was giving the killer a motive. Part of why the original was so scary was that it was just some crazy guy killing innocent teens. But here, in this one, the killer is made out to be a victim. His mother was a stripper, his father an angry ""cripple"", and his sister a promiscuous, careless teenager. The first act is spent almost entirely at the Myers' house, leading up to the massacre. Some of this is entertaining, such as Michael's mother (Sherri Moon Zombie, wife of the director), and Michael's father (William Forsythe) go-around in the opening minutes, mostly because of the incessent profanity. The rest, though, even the murders, are suprisingly boring and feel like there was nothing put into them.

The second act of the movie focuses on Michael in the sanitarium, under the watch of Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, in a role originated by Donal Pleasence in the original). Most of this segment, again, takes place in one location: the mental hospital. Michael's mother, the only one to escape the massacre, comes to visit him once a week, and alot of screen time is given to Moon-Zombie and her depression over loosing her entire family. In a nice detail, she looks much older and worse-for-the-wear in the second act than she did in the first. This act culminates in another massacre, and Myers' subsequent escape from the hospital.

The third act is spent in Haddonfield, Illinois, the setting of the original. There are the three girls, Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris), and Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart), just like in the original. There are the two kids, babysat by Compton and Harris, and there are the two respective boyfriends of Harris and Stewart. This segment of the movie, by far the shortest, is, ironically, the one that feels the longest. This is mainly due to the fact that it's basically a condensed version of the original. The four teens are killed off in the beginning of the segment, and the rest is the police and Loomis trying to get to Myers before he has a chance to kill Laurie, and chase scene between Myers and Laurie that, although long, is uninteresting. The only truly disturbing scene in the entire movie is Harris' death.

It's obvious that Zombie tried something different with his version of the movie, but it doesn't work out in his favor. Instead of the brisk pace and character development of 'The Devil's Rejects', Zombie goes overboard with blood and gore, of which the original had none. I know there was never a chance of this, but it would have been a great idea to cut out the prologue and go with the structure of the original, including leaving it bloodless. Again, I know there was never a chance of that, but it would have been interesting and, obviously, different from the norm. Ending on a positive note, Sherri Moon Zombie has to be the most attractive actress around, next to Katherine Heigl.

Runtime: 109 Minutes.

2942360,3,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, the original Halloween is my favorite horror film and I knew with Rob Zombie directing, things would get very twisted. The constant swearing (this coming from a guy who watched HBO's Deadwood) was way too frequent in the first twenty minutes. Thankfully that thinned out as the story progressed. It felt too much like the recent Texas Chainsaw remakes for my tastes. The acting wasn't as bad as most critics are saying and some of the dialogue actually made me laugh a bit. This is a very brutal movie to say the least. Even when Rob doesn't show a lot of gore, the way he films some of the murders is flat out disturbing (especially the ones involving young Michael).

I'm glad he kept the famous music and didn't shy away from showing some nudity. The MPAA seems to feel that showing a little skin is worse than peeling it off someone and deep frying it. What are these suits thinking?

The back story was nearly an hour long (1/2 hour too long) and the second half with the girls felt rushed. You just get to know them and in the next scene they are dead.

Overall, Rob didn't impress or disappoint me too much. This is really the kind of film I figured he would turn in. For me, I liked Michael Myers better as a mystery.",1188518400,3,1236,4.3652173913043475

I don't feel that the film delivered in that respect. This version of Halloween isn't as creepy as the original. Ironically, even though Meyer's back story was added, the whole movie feels like it lacking. It doesn't feel like an extension of the original movie.

2942389,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I don't like horror movies for a number of reasons, which I won't get into here. This Horror movie was a bit different. Rob Zombie did his homework on the psychological back ground of Myers, hit all the key components, and a compelling back story to boot. the story as a whole fits the traditional horror motif, naked girls, montage up close shots, violence on a grand scale that is not quite visible, yet heavily implied, and blood. Lots of blood. So, while not bad, Rob was on point.",1509926400,,485,4.46067415730337
2942390,5,B000VKL6Z2,great movie,1509926400,,11,5.0
2942391,4,B000VKL6Z2,"It's rare that a reboot of any classic film is good by any standard, but this is the exception. Rob Zombie does an excellent job re-telling the story with his own vision in mind. The casting of Malcolm McDowell is inspired. In particular, the portrayal of young Michael Meyers by Daeg Faerch is downright chilling. The one criticism is that the first half and second half feel like they are two different films. However, the juxtaposition has its merits especially for true crime aficionados. The focus on Michael's early years and the psychological component is essential to his character development overall. In addition, it is a fascinating exploration into the mind of a true psychopath. The second half is where the real fun takes place and Zombie directs some fantastically horrific scenes. Yet, despite his murderous rampage, the viewer is still left trying to understand Michael's character and his motives. This is what perhaps makes Zombie's version stand out. The film epitomises the slasher genre, yet the jump scares and blood is not what is truly terrifying. Instead, we are left haunted by our attempt and failure to humanise a psychopathic killer.",1509667200,,1163,5.0625
2942392,3,B000VKL6Z2,Thought it was the original. Then it became clear watching it that it was the Rob zombie new one.  Very interesting story. First part of it couldve been shortened up a bit. Or explained better. The middle part was really good and so was the ending.,1509580800,,248,4.391304347826087
2942393,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I am not going to waste anyone's time reviewing the movie. If you have seen it already, you know what it's about. Me telling people how good or bad it is won't change their idea about buying it. I AM going to describe the transfer and any extras on the disc. First off, the Blu-ray transfer is fantastic. It is incredibly sharp and clear. Clearer than any other Blu-Ray I own, and I have a bunch. And clearer than what you see on an HD channel on TV. It is that clear and bright. It does have bars on top and bottom, but that is because it is in 2.40:1. That is the original size of the movie and the only way they can fit ALL of it on a TV screen. I have a large screen (52 inch) plasma TV so it looked just fine that way.
The audio gave a choice of two types. Either one was clear and crisp. Not sure exactly what the difference between the two is, but I experienced no problems using either.
The deleted scenes on the disc were interesting, but I am not sure all of them are present. I have seen some scenes on YouTube from the movie that were NOT on the disc. One being a group of security guards who were assigned to move Michael Meyers from the original hospital to a less secure hospital. Michael made short and gruesome work of them. That scene is missing from the movie and deleted scenes.
It IS nice that the deleted scenes all have subtitles as an option. The second Halloween by Zombie didn't have that, and some of the the dialogue is hard to understand on his Halloween II. The second disc includes a 4 hour ""made for"" by Rob Zombie. Haven't watched it yet. All in all the Blu-Ry version is worth every penny I paid.",1509580800,,1630,4.145110410094637

Many will tell you that the remake sucked, while others will say that the original was dull and boring. Everyone has their own views on movies, and I say that both Carpenter and Zombie did great. They both gave us 2 different Michael Myers. Original kept us in a lot of suspense which is always good in horror films, the second one went in deeper. In the remake, we saw a deeper side of iconic killer, starting back when he was only a kid, leading up to his first kill, to the story showing us how any kid, if pushed hard enough, can become Michael Myers themself. Rob Zombie didn't do a piss poor job here, he basically gave us a reality if this icon were ever real.",1507334400,,786,4.3175675675675675

The overall grittiness and tone of the action scenes really made this a treat to watch. However, the one gripe I have is that Amazon streams the uncut version, rather than the theatrical release. This means we are treated to a horribly conceived rape scene that leads to Michael's escape, rather than the more plausible explanation offered in the theatrical release. One can only tolerate so much depravity before the line is pushed too far.

The blonde kid portraying Michael didn't look like Andre the giant as a grade schooler, so no way would he grow up to be that big.  Having Michael Myers be that huge makes him less scary.  Like Frankensteins monster people would spot him coming from a mile away.  He wouldnt be able to hide anywhere.  It was a problem for Halloween 4 as well having Linebacker Michael is less scary than your average person.

The original films version of Michael as a child prodigy from a normal average suburban loving home is a much more interesting premise than Michael coming from a white trash family.  The original film builds a lot of tension and left a lot of his back-story up to the viewers imagination.  In the remake Michael is bullied, but not to the tipping point where he would commit homicidal murder.

The psychiatric hospital breakout was utterly ridiculous.  Since when does Michael Myers have super human strength like Jason Vorhees in the later Friday the 13th movies?  That whole scene came off as comical nothing more.  Michael kills the guards and just happens to slowly walks out of the whole maximum security complex like a Sunday stroll in the park.

Another thing about the film that really bothers me is Michael not killing his sister Laurie onsite.  Since when would he just gather her up in his arms take her for a stroll around the block, Ludicrous Speed GO!!!!!  The Michael Myers from the original would have killed her instantly in a millisecond.

The body count is much higher in this film and you never really care about these characters in general.  It cheapens death in a way making it feel less final.  I think network TV shows are doing this far to often nowadays as well.  The original Halloween did not have a lot of blood, guts or gore, it was far more about the suspense with much better storytelling.  In this movie the gore is overboard as well once again giving us the opposite effect of scary.

I saw this film in the movie theater on its original run and when the movie finished walking out of the theater I thought man that sucked.  Now I am a fan of Rob Zombie.  I like Robs music and saw him in concert a few times and he puts on a great show.  I thought House of 1000 Corpses was not bad just a little above average.  I hated The Devils Rejects and thought it was stupid.  So lets hold the praise for calling Rob Zombie some great director.  He is not in the same league as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Alfred Hitchcock etc etc.

I would rate this film 1 to 1  stars.  It is definitely not worth your time or money.  It does nothing but tarnish the original Halloweens legacy.  Rob needs to learn that sometime less is more when it comes to horror movies.  The movie needed more suspense and less outright gore and a normal sized Michael Myers not Kane from the WWE.",1478649600,,3066,4.414285714285715

2942569,5,B000VKL6Z2,A lot of people disliked this film simply because it was a reboot of an iconic film. I thoroughly enjoyed Zombie's reimagining of this classic story.  The increased attention to the origins of Michael added a dimension I felt was lacking in the original.  He took a slightly different approach to the character of Michael as well as Dr Loomis.  It changed the flavor of the film but still kept the basic premise of the movie intact.  If you are one who feels that the original film should be inviolate then you won't like this movie.  If you enjoy a different take on a classic then this one is for you.,1478390400,2,603,4.396396396396397

Really, Rob Zombie?  Nothing more sinister or other-wordly?  He was just bullied?  Okay.

2942693,3,B000VKL6Z2,"This is definitely a case of ""Why was this made?""  Your familiar with the story, but here is a funny anecdote.  Around the time this movie came out, I saw an interview with Malcolm McDowell.  He was praising Sherrie Moon Zombie as being perfect for the role she played.  I thought, ""Oh, you're just saying that because she is the director's wife, and you're playing Hollywood butt-kissing.""  Then, I thought about what he said and the role Sherrie played, which is the role of a white trash stripper.  So, yes, I agree:  Sherrie Moon Zombie was PERFECT for this role!",1477612800,,567,4.61
2942694,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Watching this reminds one how good Carpenter's original was.  Zombie invites his audience to spend alot of time with the horribly dysfunctional family in which Michael grew into a little monster.  Later in the movie he wants us to regard the mother as loving--why then did she insist on inflicting a drunken brute on them as stepfather/live-in boyfriend?  The sanatorium to which Michael is consigned after he beats a bully to death, slices and dices the brute, kills his older sister's boyfriend, and slashes his older sister (after attempting to fondle her) takes security very laxly: they supply him with a fork with which he kills a nurse.  Zombie shows us two sadistic prison workers raping a young girl IN THE ADULT (and by now GIGANTIC) MICHAEL'S CELL.  Naturally he escapes, butchering bystanders on the way.  Carpenter frightened his audience, eventually making an ordinary couch and a broom closet terrifying.  Zombie disgusts.  Does he want his audience to reflect that, while watching the on-screen torture, they are behaving like Michael?  Who knows?  Amidst the mayhem one catches sight of competent actors earning a paycheck.  If they thought the world needed a remake of a classic, why didn't the financial backers of this sewer offer Carpenter enough money to reshoot his movie with better dialog?",1477612800,2,1314,5.093457943925234

2942700,1,B000VKL6Z2,This is terrible in every sense of the word. In this genre I like to think that a movie can be judged on how well it can scare people. This film fails to scare at all.

The thing that made the original so good was you didn't have all the predictable and unnecessary backstory. Just stick to music Mr. Zombie because your movies suck.",1477526400,,465,4.825

2942721,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Visually, this movie is great. Rob Zombie is great at putting together a scene, and his cinematography is intense. The dialogue, however, is awful. Zombie also tends to be obsessed with sex scenes, as there are 3 of them in this, each one with completely different characters. This doesn't bother me but I can see it being off-putting or distracting to others. The backstory given to Michael Myers in this movie is also much weaker, and takes away from how much of a monster Michael is supposed to be. The acting is simply average, and the lead actress has nowhere near the charisma of Jamie Lynn Curtis in the original. If you enjoy good scary scenes and slasher movies, and aren't bothered by poor dialogue and average at best plot, then this movie is for you.",1477526400,4,762,4.610294117647059

In its favor it did get better as the movie went on. It's just the entire beginning with the character development was just boringly predictable. I don't watch Robs movies because his characters all seem like the same stereotype in every movie that he does. It's like he gave all his metal head and wrestling and fetish friends roles in all his movies. And it's supposed to shock us, but it doesn't. It's boring and predictable when he does the slow close up of someones face that only his inner circle are supposed to recognise. I want to gag. The characters always act exactly the same. Oh here's a shouty violent stripper, here's a shouty violent drunk guy. Oh look here's some more shouty domestic violence. Oh look everyone has long hair and tattoos. Oh look at me I'm edgy, and wierd. You're not used to wierd, are you, average viewer? It's boring and it insults my boredom threshold.
How are we supposed to believe that there's some kind of quiet preternatural intelligence in Mike Myers character if his family are just morons? There are so many angles the character development and childhood plot could have gone in but instead we just got a pile of stupid. Easy way out. After the childhood scenes the movie got better.

Personally any 'Horror Movies' now either put me to sleep (Better than a Tylenol PM), or have me in a fit of giggles. I'm kinda hard to scare now with all the films I've seen :(

Halloween is a good written movie. I absolutely love the first 30 minuets of it! (Don't worry No spoilers from me.) The ending kinda made me laugh, feel sad, and jump. all at the same time.

I would give it five stars the only thing that stopped it was too much recurring tit scene it felt like they paid a frat dude to stay on set I find scenes that they COULD have a topless chick in.",1475107200,4,878,4.093023255813954

2942996,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Just my opinions, but....this probably should have been a prequel to the classic Halloween instead of a remake. Even a movie based on the original classic. To take such a great classic and turn it into this is just SAD. Rob Zombie is too talented for this. Entirely too much $mut and domestic violence which can be left to the imagination if done properly. I tried to watch this a few years ago, and only made it to the second scene. I thought I'd try it again this evening, but again...I could not make it beyond the second scene. It is disturbing, especially being a remake of a terrific classic horror which gives a great feel of the true Halloween spirit.",1474675200,3,659,4.454545454545454

2942998,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Not sure where to start other than this film was bad from the get-go. I will say that I liked Rob Zombie's ""Devils rejects"" and ""House of a 1000 corpses,"" but this remake was atrocious. First things first, Zombie recycles his actors. It is a tad difficult to get into a movie when the same people show up in his films. Second, the whole part of what made Myers creepy and sinister was that we knew extremely little about him. He did not communicate with anyone in the original and that's what made it great. Zombie turns Myers into a momma's boy and a piece of trailer trash which ruins one of, if not THE, best characters in horror.",1474502400,,633,4.3277310924369745

Being a huge horror fan I was disdained in what other directors did to damage the reputation of other slasher films like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street. Zombie not only did a great job on staying true to the core story but also added a back story to how Michael Myers grew up. Casting was great Tyler Mane who plays Michael Myers.

2943072,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Well,"" loved it"" are  not exactly the words I would use when describing my feelings about this film. However, I gave it a five because it was very good. Of course, my favorite is the original Halloween. This movie is brutal and gory with full front nudity. Some parts are brutally gory and rather savage. However, what else would you expect from Rob Zombie? The take on Michael Myers childhood would fit the development of the full blown violent psychosis he lived with. At least the part about the small animal torture that he practiced and the bullying that he endured. As far as his family structure and the other families in this film; they were all twisted in some way, so I consider the representation just a tongue and cheek satire on the American family, and the American teen. Rob Zombie wanted to do his take on ""Halloween"" and did a darn good job on it.  He was able to put on film what he envisioned as his style of an old favorite.

However, this movie is definitely not for little kids. It would give them nightmares and the contents can be viewed as inappropriate.",1468022400,,1079,4.494897959183674

2943078,5,B000VKL6Z2,Normally I am not a fan of remake of a classic film. Robbie Zombie put a great take on the original Halloween film. Like that this version allows us to know more about Michael Myers. In this version we learn why Michael returns home. In the original had no idea Laurie was his baby sister. Lots of surprises and twist in this film so that it's fresh. While I really enjoyed this version there is only one Laurie Strode and that's Jamie Lee Curtis. Still it's really exciting heck Robbie Zombie involved in it...,1467331200,,511,4.446808510638298

2943081,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a very visceral, brutally honest remake and homage to the 80s horror classic that, though predictably scary, is a fun film to enjoy on a dark and stormy night. There is something to be said about a child who grows up in an abusive household and who develops a penchant for animal sadism, which evolves in a full-on blood lust. The first half of this film takes an uncompromising look at Michael's upbringing and ultimate abandonment in a mental health facility, where he descends into a morass of seething rage and hatred of life.

The drama (struggle) of his character is very clear; you know and understand beyond any doubt, WHY he became a psychopath to begin with. Rob Zombie (of White Zombie rock fame) does a great job with this movie, pushing his previous B style flops to the background with a monster of a thriller as beefy as Michael Myers himself.

The campy coming-of-age and horniness teen slasher has come full circle, blending in the obligatory (and predictable) teen sexuality and primal fear that made 80s slasher flicks cult classics. This SHOULD be the last remake; it is well made, well written, and enjoyable.",1466899200,,1138,4.742424242424242

Just a story that didn't make a lot of sense, some jump scares, boobs just for the sake of having boobs in there, an uncomfortable rape scene that didn't even seem to be necessary to the plot just plain disturbing, mediocre performances with the exception of Tyler Mane who definitely fit the role well but was misused, and awful dialogue. I'll give this movie the benefit of the doubt and say that the first act with the origin of Michael at ten years old was exceptional. It was scary and not just disturbing, set up the movie and it's characters, and gave a look on what the motivations are by the main character. But after that, there wasn't much to cover that was either interesting or even original. So mediocre it made me sad, and I needed to watch comedy to feel better. That hardly ever happens.

Its a different take on the whole thing as it gives us a look at Michael's childhood.  This kind of movie is always going to have the blood and guts factor but in this one I think it was done well, not too much and not too gross.  The only thing, which is typical in a lot of movies, is the animal deaths.  At least we don't have to watch them get killed but I could have lived without it.  Otherwise, great movie!  Hard to find good horror these days.",1464652800,,552,4.055555555555555
2943115,4,B000VKL6Z2,"We all know how horror remakes usually go. I mean we live in an era where almost every single horror movie is either a remake or a sequel, so clearly originality is running thin these days and I usually like to say that if it was good the first time, leave it alone. With that being said, Rob Zombie actually didn't do a horrible job. Yes, there were a lot of things that were lacking but one thing I have to absolutely applaud is the superior casting. The cast of this movie was absolutely outstanding. Sheri Moon Zombie, William Forsythe, Hanna Hall, and Daeg Faerch made probably the best possible Myers family you could possibly find. I mean all of this can make you perfectly understand why Michael would become the killer he is. The broken household and Michael's obsession with torturing and killing animals are textbook serial killer signs. The transformation is so easy to understand and so that was done really well. The movie does feel a little short and rushed and there is a lot left to be desired but honestly for a remake this is a pretty visionary film for the stigma that horror remakes get these days for good reason.",1464393600,,1135,4.541463414634146

Unfortunately after the movie movies past the events that lead him to a mental hospital/facility we aren't really given any reason to care about Michael. The film has small ""clips"" and narrative from his physiologist as to his behavior, and his withdrawal from humanity. After the ""escape"" the film basically reverts back to the 1978 original.

The child playing young Michael was perfect! He had this angelic, innocent face that made for a disturbing transition when the psychotic breakdown began. It also explained the 'mask.'

2943236,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I love this movie!  It's one of my favorite Halloween movies.

Rob Zombie takes John Carpenter's original Halloween and makes it his own, making it more violent, re-creating the characters his way, and adding a backstory and a motive for Michael to kill.  In this version, he is abused and bullied, lives in a broken home and the only one who cares for him is his mom.  The first half of the movie is him as a kid committing the murders and then goes through his time in the insane asylum.  Before this came out, the last time we saw Michael Myers was when he was getting beaten through martial arts by Busta Rhymes in Halloween: Resurrection.  Where do you go with him from there?

The characters are great in my opinion.  I like Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode more than Jamie Lee Curtis because she is more relatable in these movies because I'm the agenow as these characters are in the movie, and Scout reacts to her situation with Michael much like I would think someone would if it happened now.  Unlike the original, where Dr. Loomis shoots Michael and it ends, this time, Laurie has to take on Michael herself at the end, which helps add to her character.  Tyler Mane as Michael Myers is great.  He is more brutal than he has been in the past, and I like that.  I like the mask because in real life, it would rot after sitting around for 17 years.  Malcolm McDowell is as good a choice for Dr. Loomis as anyone would be.  I think he does a great job in this movie.  Danielle Harris comes back from the original series this time as Annie, and she does a good job with her role.  Brad Dourif is great as Sheriff Brackett.  Sheri Moon Zombie is good as Deborah Myers.  You really feel sorry for her about her family situation and feel sad about what happens after her family is murdered and Michael is locked up.  Daeg Faerch is good as young Michael and he is kind of creepy at times.  The whole cast does an excellent job in their roles.

The only negative thing I can say about the Unrated version is Michael's escape scene.  The Theatrical version's escape scene where he kills the guards is a lot better than the Unrated version's, which is a rape scene.

The 3-Disc Unrated Collector's Edition that I have comes with the commentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending, bloopers (Which are funny and entertaining), the theatrical trailer, and featurettes: The Many Masks of Michael Myers; Meet the Cast; Casting Sessions; and Scout Taylor-Compton Screen Test.  The third disc comes with a 4 1/2 hour documentary, Michael Lives: The Making Of Halloween, which goes through from pre-production to the end of post-production.  It's a neat and insightful documentary.

This is one of the most underrated movies in the Halloween series.  When I want to watch a Halloween movie, I frequently watch Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II, then Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and the original Halloween.  Rob Zombie's Halloween is grittier, more brutal and violent, and I enjoy it every time I watch it.  I don't care what people say about these movies, I love them.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and this is mine.

EDIT:

I bought the Theatrical version that has the much better alternate escape scene where Michael kills the guards while being transferred.  Because of the escape, I like the Theatrical version more than the Unrated version.  The Theatrical DVD comes with the same special features as the Unrated version except it doesn't have the documentary.",1451606400,,3494,4.6644844517184945

2943241,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This is an excellent remake. Unfortunately it takes the story in a different direction than the original. Giving Michael a back story definitely adds a psychological twist.

2943242,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I personally love the Halloween franchise, but this one is a different story... His childhood was an okay part of the movie, but it took half of the movie away.

2943243,1,B000VKL6Z2,Just like all of Rob Zombie's movies all the dialogue is loud complaining. If I wanted to hear white trash bitch and moan for 2 hours I'd just go to Walmart and steal somebody's Cheetos.,1449878400,3,186,4.3428571428571425
2943244,4,B000VKL6Z2,"If you don't care for Rob Zombie the filmmaker, I don't know why you buy his films and then complain after you watch them. As a fan of Zombie, I found this remake better than most remakes and no one portrays the white trash culture better than Rob Zombie. The Unrated edition contains over 7 minutes of footage the MPAA made him cut out in order to receive an R-Rating and also contains some exposition that fleshes-out the characters. There are also a ton of cameos (some which are no longer with us), which is another Zombie trait. Zombie has been a horror fan since he was a kid and I find his style infecting. All the haters should just move on and watch PG-13 drivel like TWILIGHT or THE HUNGER GAMES franchises. If it's violence and over-the-top dialogue you want, Zombie is your man. I found this ""re-imagining"" clever and it in no way diminishes John Carpenter's version. You can always purchase the 10 different versions of that film on DVD. It's not like they took it off the market to make way for Zombie's version. There is enough room for both versions.",1449532800,,1066,4.5

Seeing Michael go from a troubled boy to a maniac and breaking out of the psych ward is enjoyable.  So, the 1st half gets 5 stars from me.
The 2nd half of the movie is where Michael returns to Haddonfield and it's pretty much typical Halloween/horror genre from there on out.  Michael kills all his baby sisters friends and then takes her prisoner until he is finally killed by multiple bullets...you know in horror movies multiple shots only takes the killer down long enough to let your guard down again.  I'll give the 2nd half 3 stars, so a combined score of 4.",1447286400,,721,4.350746268656716

2943325,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm one of millions who think the original is a classic! So, I wasn't expecting much. This is one film I'd classify as a re-imagining, more than a remake.  Definitely, a totally different approach from Carpenter. One of the reasons Michael was so menacing was the mystery of why he became such a Monster. The question of nature versus nurture was never involved in any explanation of Michael.
  Rob Zombie gives his reasoning for the madness of Michael Myers. It's interesting, different, and much more bloody than the original. It does take some of the mystique away from the character, but it serves the modern day blood lust of today's viewers. And, in the world in which we live, this seems very real!
The young Michael is my favorite part of the film. The  kid looks psychotic!  I would lock my doors if he came Trick or treating!  The only downside is Sherry Moon.  A terrible actress who hurts an otherwise, better than expected reimagined classic.",1447027200,,955,4.716867469879518

2943541,2,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, Halloween did not need to be remade.  Considering that Rob Zombie is a fan of the horror genre, I thought his take would be a little more interesting.

I can't say whether this film is good or bad.  The prologue is vulgar and needless, but the scenes in the hospital are well-done.  There are scenes of visual elegance smashed into very clumsy, brutal stuff.  It seems as if you are watching two films- one a modern slasher, with prolonged deaths and gratuitous nudity, and the other a reinterpretation of a classic in the same style.  All the white trash antics seem out of place, and the violence is not frightening so much as painful, but when Michael is haunting the streets on Halloween night, some semblance of the film  that could have been shines through.

I am one of the rare few who appreciate the sequel, as I think it finds the harmony between Zombie's formal leanings and the blunt nature of his style.  This one, not so much.",1446249600,,951,4.514619883040936

2943545,5,B000VKL6Z2,"As remakes go, this is one of the best I've ever seen.  It builds on the terror of John Carpenter's original vision and fleshes it out with many more diverse and interesting characters.  It's definitely a grave mistake to raise a budding psychopath in an environment fraught with bullying as well as physical and mental abuse; it's the formula for the creation of a true monster.  Zombie's method of introducing the viewer to more of young Michael's ""less than ideal"" home life and childhood provides some foreshadowing of the grisly consequences to follow.  It's admittedly more of a shock in the original movie since we were only shown fleeting glimpses of the possible triggers for Michael's psychopathy, but both approaches have their merits.",1446249600,,746,5.040650406504065

2943550,4,B000VKL6Z2,Sort of interesting reboot of the Halloween movies with a different take on Michael Myers. The brunt of the movie is the childhood Michael had and pretty much what makes him tick.

I feel Rob Zombie has really grown as a director (House of thousand corpse looked like a music video) and then the Devils Rejects happened.

If you want to see naked teens getting stabbed to death, then you can't go wrong here with this Halloween reboot.

2943617,3,B000VKL6Z2,"SPOILER ALERT:  90 minutes into the movie, I was anxious to return and give this movie a 5 star rating!  Unfortunately, I watched the final 30 minutes.  It fell apart.  Michael takes the girl to the old house.  When she wakes and tries to escape, all doors are locked, chained, etc.  When she finally gets outside, there's a fence.  Locked and chained.  She gets by that, to find herself... in a graveyard?  This one even has a huge hole (I guess for mass burials )into which she of course falls.  With Dr. Loomis' help, she escapes - temporarily, and while Michael is gouging the doctor's eyes out, she runs back into the house.  Once she's inside, there's again no way out. ??? Michael drags Loomis inside - and the blood on him has totally disappeared (as has the bullet holes the dr. had put in Michael's clothes). The girl has the gun.  At one point, she's about a foot away and concealed from Michael - but she doesn't fire.  She crawls through a hole in a wall barely large enough to fit through - ignoring the much larger a hole a foot higher.  She gets to the attic and, hearing her, Michael starts to destroy the ceiling, thus the wood beneath her.  Yet only when she escapes to a section of the attic Michael hasn't touched - does the floor give way and she falls through!  The doctor wakes up, and some of the blood has returned, along his left cheek. His eyes are fine.  Michael comes face to face with the girl, and again she doesn't fire.  So he charges, and both go over the open balcony (recall there was no way out?) and hit the ground.  Bullets and clubs don't harm him, but the fall knocks Michael out cold.  And the small teenager recovers first!  She finally deigns to fire, but the gun fails to go off - three times.  Did the dr., who earlier bought the gun, fail to load it fully?? Only 3 shots have been fired!  But no... just as the police show up (who called them?) and Michael wakes, she fires once more - and blows Michael's head off.  My suggestion? Watch the first 90 minutes.  It's great!  But, sadly, the final 30 minutes are enough to lose it 2 stars.",1445731200,,2085,4.322997416020672

I don't like all the cursing and the way it depicts the Myers house as some dysfunctional trailer trash family. Just all around not a very good movie. Nothing else I can say really I just did not find this enjoyable. One redeeming quality about this movie is when the young Michael Myers kills the bully kid with the big stick.

2943766,1,B000VKL6Z2,"As per IMBD's ""trivia,"" I understand that John Carpenter, out of respect for his friend R. Zombie, has never seen this film. In this respect, Carpenter is one of the lucky ones. I am a fan of the original, and I guess that's what ruined it for me. At least Zombie didn't mess much with Carpenter's original score, which is about the only positive thing I can take away from this flick. Zombie ""treats"" his audience likes idiots who need every little facet spelled out for them; he leaves little room for suspense and imagination. This movie is rarely ""scary"" per se, but it is horrific. Still, if you like ""gallons"" of blood, non-stop violence and swearing, then this film might be for you.",1442880000,,690,4.57258064516129

The language was FILTHY. I was so embarrassed with the F-word flying all over the place at the very outset, and my realization that it was in NO WAY the classic Halloween... I simply turned it off and never even watched the rest of it.  Instead we got out Empire of the Sun, which the little cousins absolutely loved.  I would recommend this film to no one... albeit I'm certain it appeals to its own type of demographic--not for those who don't want to hear a litany of obscenities right from the get-go.",1436400000,,768,4.4714285714285715

2943806,3,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie is really hard for me to rate. The first half of it, following young Micheals (beautifully played by Daeg Faerch) genesis into an unstoppable killing machine is a tour de force and one of the best things ever put on film genre wise. For this the movie would have deserved a 5 star rating. But after this genious excursion into true terror the movie became a poor copy of the (in my opinion not very frightning, or scary, or suspensful) John Carpenter film. So the second part would have deserved a 1 star rating, so I tried to find some middle ground here. I'm a big fan of Rob Zombie`s work (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects) and in the first half of this film he showed us what he is capable of. Unfortunately he wasted  an opportunity in creating something that the original film (again: in my opinion for no reason) is always labeled with: a true masterpiece of horror film making.",1431993600,4,909,4.4431137724550895

Rob Zombie does an excellent job in revealing Michael Meyer's Psycho Pathological origins. Even though Zombie's sequel to this remake was somewhat lack luster, it still was good enough for me to say I wish Rob Zombie would at Least finish the Halloween series. His direction and vision would definitely resurrect an old time classic to new heights.

Rob Zombie removed anything truly horrorifying that was put together in the original movies and tried to add a explanation of why this actually happened from beginning to end losing any real reason why this should be considered a horror movie & instead be a lame attempt at a documentary on the effects of bad parenting, drugs, abuse, etc. could have on children in the household.

2943833,5,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, let me say that if you want to experience the original John Carpenter Halloween movies, those still exist in all their glory. This movie does not in any way tarnish what was made before.

I prefer to think of the Zombie films as wholly unique. They are a different story.

The original Halloween presented us with Michael Meyers as the living embodiment of pure evil, a faceless menace with no conscience who could not be killed and had no human motivation.

Zombie, on the other hand, presents us with a sociopathic child, bred in a dysfunctional environment, his evil both biological and environmental.

I like both incarnations of the monster.

I give this movie 5 stars primarily because of the first half hour or so. I really enjoyed seeing the Meyers backstory. I also enjoyed the way Meyers was so visceral. The scene in the truckstop bathroom comes to mind, where Meyers pounds the trucker through a seemingly solid stall partition, and we see the metal buckle and warp with each maniacal hit. Meyers is a giant, powerful manifestation of darkness, come to wreak havoc on the world.

After the beginning, the movie becomes more of an homage to the original than a treading of new ground, devolving into typical horror movie tropes. However, these tropes are executed and acted well.

The movie is far better than the average slasher film, that's for sure.

If you are a horror movie aficionado, you will enjoy this movie, provided you can keep its mythos distinct from the originals.",1418083200,3,1505,4.783783783783784

How does Loomis leave her alone with him?  How do they give him a metal fork?  The reporter says ""the most gruesome murders since Manson.""  So they cant put 2+2 together?  Comon.

2943921,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been a Halloween fan since the 1978 original version. I was a kid when I first saw them so to put Daeg Faerch in as the role of young Michael Myers, was fantastic. Great to have the kid's point of view. He is captivating in the movie, from his genetics, body language, tone of voice. Perfect.

I have had mixed feelings about Rob Zombie in the past. I used to love his music but then got older and grew out of that trend. Then, I saw some of his newer movies and found them disjointed and a bit confusing. He does have a great sense of humor though, but I (mistakenly) thought that this element would take over this movie in a far too overwhelming way. However, this movie brings Rob justice as well as his wife Sherry Moon Zombie. She's actually a great actress along with being supremely beautiful.

I love that the choice to delve deeper into Michael's past was a large part of the movie because to all Halloween fans, I believe I can safely say that, we all wondered what exactly happened there but very little was discussed. I was quite impressed that there were elements that were completely validated by science: Michael was killing small animals for a time, quite angry, a social outcast and hid this all under his mother's nose. His broken family with little boundaries sexually of course can damage psyche as well. This is true to psychological and psychiatric assessments of early (as in budding) serial killers, but Rob is very smart so I am not surprised, just grateful.

I was truly overjoyed to see Danielle Harris return to the Halloween series after being in Halloween 4 and 5. There are very many scenes and lines that I was smiling about because they were so close to being taken from the original one. Rob Zombie paid great respect and tribute to the original.

My final thought but my most important is that I actually LIKED Michael in this. He was a sympathetic character as well as being a bad ass. Great job Rob Zombie!!!!",1414886400,2,1953,4.492957746478873

Some of the characters are annoying, but they're meant to be that way. A couple of things surprised me. It was interesting to see so much of Michael as a boy. I think all of the actors/actresses did a great job. I was glad to see more than one survivor at the end (but don't get too attached to everyone who survives if you watch the sequel).

While I appreciated the deeper perspective into Michael Myers, and how evil manifested itself within him, I felt the movie was nothing more than a illustration of profanity and gratuitous violence. What made the original such a classic was how John Carpenter used pacing, time and classic story telling to tell his story. To weave the audience into the film in a manner that was reflective of his inspiration. One Alfred Hitchcock.

Unfortunately for Mr. Zombie, his playbook is deeply and profoundly flawed. A playbook in which the usual was employed as a substitute for what makes a great film. Horror or otherwise. Good characters, a good storyline and a plot that amounts to something more than a collection of horrible actors drenched in a derived, blood soaked mess. In short, this movie was nothing more than a piece of garbage. Garbage undeserving of carrying the moniker of its superior predecessor. Don't waste your time....",1414713600,,1001,4.923076923076923

Here he wants to go into the back story of Michael Myers and make the movie more about him. What he doesn't understand is that we don't want to go into the back story of Michael Myers. It's like showing too much of the shark in Jaws or too much of the Xenomorph in Alien. He doesn't get the appeal of the movies. Which makes you scratch your head because he's such a fan of the original cult film. This is the problem with all these remakes and movies in general.

It changed my life along with the original Universal Monster and forever turned me into a Horror Movie Junkie who now attends conventions. With that being said I wasn't upset when I heard one of my favorite musical performers and directors would be remaking this film. I wasn't even skeptical, I loved House of 100 Corpses for its campyness and insanity, AND the Devil's Rejects for its grit and badass tendencies. I guess I'm one of the few who actually doesn't mind remakes(I really disliked the ""Psycho"" remake), I enjoy seeing a fresh perspective on things especially when they pay homage to the original. I dunno, I can separate the two in my head and nothing gets ruined for me.

Adapt or Die

So now the film. I Liked the back story (It's funny, before this film I would hear people say ""I wish I knew his back story!"" than after this film I heard the same people say ""Who cares about his back story it ruins everything!"" The hypocrisy is astounding here) I liked the casting. I loved how many scenes were filmed on the same Pasadena streets as the original and how Rob Zombie had to use fake leaves that they made and would have to rake them up, just like John Carpenter had done nearly 30 years prior. And finally, the mask was great too, I always thought the way the masks looked in Halloween 4,5,6,7,8 were lacking compared to the original first two films. This made me happy. The more people I talk to about this film, the more I hear about how much they actually love it as time goes by. Besides... lets be honest.. After the first 2 films, The rest of the Halloween series got very bland and corny, 4,5,6,7,8? 4 and 5 are filled with 80's cheese (not that that's a bad thing, I love it, but these are so dated and all the fear of Michael Myers that I had was gone) 6 was the first Halloween film I saw in the Theaters and brought back some of the childhood fears I had of some slasher invading my home and trying to kill me (lol). 7:H20 was very nostalgic with the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, and 8...??? ""Trick or Treat Motherfucker? Nah man. I remember watching that and holding my head saying ""My favorite franchise is dead.""

Than this happened. Raw, gritty, and finally something I didn't feel like I was wasting my money on. Of all the recent remakes, this is by far my favorite, I don't really even think of it as a remake in my head anymore, In my mind its just ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". Kudos Rob Zombie! P.S. I even Liked the sequel, go with the directors cut of both films) Enjoy!

Also the way Laurie acts with her parents? are you kidding me? find me six ""good"" girls who talk to their parents like that and make those kinds of jokes, they dont. They turned one of her friends into a bitchy nasty trashy chick who you almost rooted for the  death of same with the oldest sister. I personally loved in the original how michael didn't have a reason to go bad, he simply was. Some people simply are born bad. I believe that they don't need a tragic back story of living in a dumpy house with a trashy family a mom who is blind to how screwed up her kids are etc... I think michael myers as a five year old who murders his older sister and her boyfriend just because is extremely more disturbing than the ten year old who is bullied everywhere he goes that eventually just snaps but some how restrains from killing his mother and baby sister. also the age time line in this movie doesnt make sense. In the beginning of the movie Laurie is supposed to be 1 at most but 15 years later she is a senior in high school? not to mention we go from the 70s to the late 90s/early 2000s? Also I don't know anyone who talks the way zombie constantly has his characters speak. cussing everyother word? I have never met a single person without the help of alcohol who speaks like that. I suggest skipping this movie unless you just like watching teenagers die horribly gory ways. the added back story at the beginning was a good idea but took away from the horror that is Michael Myers. a ""boy so evil neither heaven nor hell would have him""",1413590400,,1701,4.282608695652174

Then I took a recess from it, and upon watching it again I realize... maybe I was far too hopeful. Maybe I just wanted to see a grittier, more violent Michael Myers, which I got. Everything else that came with that ruined what little fun I had with a more maniacal Michael Myers. Rob Zombie did not handle this story well at all. I don't like how he tried to make Michael into a product of a harsh environment. The Allure of Michael Myers (for me anyways) was always the enigma. No one knows what made him snap the first time. Mr. Zombie destroyed that. On the plus side, Danielle Harris returns to Haddonfield, which is a nice little bonus.",1412985600,,744,4.321428571428571

Remakes really have to go in a new direction to ever work.  Here they try setting up a realistic back story for the killer Michael Myers.  It didn't work for me.  Anyone who has seen the original knows that a good part of the fun is the fact that a murderer with a knife, who is killing teenagers on Halloween, turns out to be supernatural entity. That's how a 6'4"" guy wearing a creepy mask gets to lurk on sidewalks in the middle of day, that's how he can fade in and out of shadows, that's why he can take six gun shots and get up and disappear. By going the realistic route and still have Michael Meyers do all these things, the movie comes off a bit ridiculous.

Beyond the central problem with the story, I thought the acting was better than you'll find in most horror movies these days, and, strangely enough, once the movie gets past its new origin story, the second half does effectively ramp up the tension and brutality in the later scenes to good effect.

I know studios are contractually obligated to make movies because they'll lose the copyright, but the best of this remake should have been a new property.",1412380800,,1239,4.412280701754386

2944006,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm a huge fan of the original Halloween series, so naturally I was excited about the remake, and enjoyed this movie. I like that we get to see more of Michaels childhood, but the brutal, biker/stripper/neglectful/trailer trash upbringing was a bit of a stretch from the original. The original painted Michaels home life as a very normal, white bread suburban one, which made his murderous break from reality as a child even that much more disturbing. I felt they spent a little too much time on Michael and Dr. Loomis' relationship in the mental hospital and not enough time on Michaels calculated stalk of Laurie, which was among the best suspense sequences of the genre for its time. Overall I thought Rob Zombie did a good job, but some of it was a bit over the top for Halloween and horror genre purists like myself. The graphic  shock and awe factor that Rob movies are famous for is lost on me since I favor the story more than the gore and gratuitous T&A.",1412121600,,963,4.566473988439307

so when i heard about this remake by Rob zombie i didn't think much of it at all
i thought it was an insult to the original classic
just like it was insult for Platinum Dunes Production to remake NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST
i decide to rent it from my Local Video store just to check it out
i rented the UNRATED version which has extra scenes in it
the whole film is Different from John carpenter's version so not all Halloween fans will like it
Rob zombie wrote the script aswell as Directing it
in the script Michael myers mother SHERI MOON ZOMBIE is included in the plot which i don't think was necessary for the story
there are more scenes of Dr Loomis treating Michael myers at the Mental Hospital
the Actress who played Laurie strode in this film SCOUT TAYLOR-COMPTON
thought she over done the acting for the role
about half way through the film i lost interest, i'm to much big a fan of John carpenter's version
to give this remake a chance
John carpenter's version is a classic there should've never been a remake in the first place
this version is definitely an acquired taste of film so not all Halloween fans like myself will like it.
i might as well talk about the rest of the blu-ray which are the special features
Disc 1 has lots of featurettes,
RE-IMAGINING HALLOWEEN & MEET THE CAST featurette's, plus Bloopers and Audio commentary
Disc 2 has 4hour on the set footage of the making of the film
I only tried to watch the film once all the way through barely, i don't think i'll be watching it again

so, i revisited rob zombie's halloween. i hated it the first time i saw it, but now, seven years later, i hafta confess i have much more positive feelings about rob's grimy 70's-inspired revisit to haddonfield. there is a lot going for this movie, and there are some troubling things against it. ultimately, i think it works, particularly as rob seeks to give michael myers some impetus for being the way he is. i feel content to consider this movie on its' own, free from comparison to carpenter's brilliant original. rob zombie did not direct john carpenter's halloween; he directed rob zombie's halloween.

i really enjoyed seeing little kid michael myers this time around. daeg faerch does a tremendous job portraying a troubled little boy whose lack of empathy makes it easy for him to kill brutally. while it's predictable to see him torturing animals and surrounded by family dysfunction, it makes sense. he was a kid, and he had to start somewhere. i appreciate the clear message that cruelty to animals leads to more cruelty, and it kind of touches my soul that despite rob's penchant for on-screen sadism and cruelty, he's clearly an animal advocate. we get michael's first foray into killing, as he dispatches a handful of folks who he doesn't particularly care for, leaving only himself and his infant sister.

in these early scenes, i really dug seeing little michael receive counsel from dr. sam loomis, who is wonderfully played by malcolm mcdowell. mcdowell is not donald pleasance. his sam loomis is at once more connected with michael, and more self-serving, as well. he really cares about michael, and is somewhat heartbroken when his efforts fail to get through. the scenes shared by mcdowell and faerch are natural and well-written. i found that they augmented my understanding of michael myers, and actually made him kind of sympathetic. while he is very much a psychopath, or merely a ""shape of a human"", as loomis cleverly observes, zombie's michael has more in common with frankenstein's monster than with the very essence of evil. i mean, i'm pretty sure he's evil, too, but unlike in the prior series, this michael is human and has impulses. he's trying to figure out who is, what's going on, and who's left that he connects with (i.e. that he didn't kill). i also like michael's obsessive mask-making, and the masks themselves are very much zombie, which makes me appreciate the hand he has in the visual aesthetic of this movie.

i feel i must stick-up for the very beleaguered and hard-working sheri moon-zombie, who is fantastic as an overwhelmed mother in a world well out of her control. she loses everything, and still visits michael and tries her best to love him. i believed her pain.

so, we fast forward to the present, and see teenager laurie strode, nee angel myers, who is growing-up in a loving household, filled with people who genuinely care about one another. this stands in stark contrast to the chaos of her infancy, and dee wallace and pat skipper are excellent as laurie's stable family. the interactions between the strode's is natural and loving, foreshadowing poor laurie's locomotive of heartbreak. scout tayler-compton does a nice job of establishing who she is when spewing crude sexual taunts at her mother (ah, rob, you're incorrigible) and then lovingly helping her fix a plastic skeleton. she may be virginal, but she's real.

another delight i took in this viewing was appreciating the relationship between laurie and the children she's babysitting. again, despite his insane level of violence, rob brings a compassionate and clever hand when working with children. laurie is a babysitter who really enjoys working with kids and it shows. the children themselves are hilarious when needed, and terrified at others. they were great. it's also refreshing to see again that in rob zombie's world, ten year-old modern day kids will sit in rapt attention while watching old black and white movies. we see snips from white zombie and the thing, of course. this led me to think that perhaps michael myers dresses as he does in a nod to james arness in everybody's favorite 50's science fiction flick.

halloween is loaded with great performers, from sid haig to ken foree, to danny trejo, who gets, outside of spy kids, a rare sympathetic role. we also see leslie easterbrook, bill mosely, sybill danning, daniel roebuck, richard lynch, and udo kier, among others, in great cameos. the rest of the cast is excellent, including brad douriff as sheriff bracket, and danielle harris,, little jamie from halloween 4 and 5, as his daughter, annie.

and annie brings me to the main problem with zombie's halloween, and it's a big one. she fights and claws and scratches, but her dramatic scene of violence features her topless. earlier, kristen klebe is killed completely nude, and michael's sister is also killed with little clothing on. in general, i have no issue with how rob zombie portrays or writes women, and i don't at all believe that he's a misogynist, but three naked or partially naked women killed in one movie is a definite red flag. throw in a repugnant and unnecessary rape scene in the unrated director's cut (i am not very tolerant of rape in movies, so if it's in there it damn well better be central to the plot; don't play lightly with those intentions or images), and halloween starts to display, for me, some troubling vibes. these moments distracted from what was otherwise an excellent movie, i thought, and they nag at me now. what makes it even crazier is that, in addition to the clear link between animal cruelty and increased violence, there are several lines of dialogue that rail against corporate greed, class inequity, and poor treatment of the mentally ill, so it doesn't really figure why rob's got this movie loaded with so much needless intersection of violence and sexuality. michael may be repressed ( i assume), but, other than an early scene of him creepily caressing his sisters leg, little is suggested that he's acting out sexually. anything but, really, and he does show compassion and restraint here and there. my hope is that rob directed those scenes with visions of last house on the left (where those horrid sequences were central to the plot and the purpose of the movie) or old nazi prison flicks. but please, rob, beware. i love your use of homage, but don't do it blindly. you're much too smart and too good. i tolerated that sh** in devil's rejects, cus it fit, but it doesn't really fit here.

this movie is brutal, and this michael myers is shockingly violent, and becomes even more so in the superior sequel. tyler mane's size is just astounding, and he moves with strength and power and forcefulness. he is unrelenting bulk, and i think he was cast well and did a great job.

halloween features great music, great make-up (wayne toth, you rock!), great set design, and a great camera. rob captures illinois in the fall, and creates a creepy halloween atmosphere. the cast is fantastic. it meanders a bit at the end, and even with it's potentially troublesome sexual politics, i think rob zombie has successfully explored and executed his conception of michael myers and the halloween mythos. and the final sequence, in its' schockingness, is an absolute scream, baby.",1406505600,2,7296,4.890864995957963

This is one serious piece of fanfic. We finally get to see the development of Michael Myers into the monster who scared us all in the original Halloween, as imagined by one of the sickest minds in showbiz (luv ya, Rob!).
Zombie totally discards the demon possession/witchcraft theories spun about for years (and featured in Halloweens 4 and 5) in favor of the child driven deep into psychosis by his abusive stepfather and the negative and violent environment in which he was imprisoned.
My only gripe is that he never did a sequel. In one scene Michael's sister tells her boyfriend that her real daddy (and Michael's) was in Heaven. Maybe Michael's twisted mind also had a genetic marker?

I was in no hurry to see this, but since Lords of Salem was unavailable on Redbox, I went to Amazon. I was 'settling' for Halloween. And dubious, but willing to be entertained.
This movie is very much like bicycling on a steep hill. The beginning is so slow and trudging, you have time to get impatient, and start making judgements about the film as a whole. At an apex, suddenly you're flying and its all downhill! What?? It's Halloween!! How engaging and interesting can it be?? Well!
There's no shortage of murdering and naked teenagers, and really almost no softening of the Myers character, but there is a definite appreciation of emotion throughout the playout of the story that seems to give it the depth and intelligence that the original lacked for me. That appreciation of finer emotion and deceptive use of sympathy actually winds up suckering you into a constant one-two punch at every next step Michael takes. It seems like this time is going to be different... ooh, Michael Myers is cool with so-and-so... then Blam! Noooo!!

2944109,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's ambitious retelling of the Carpenter classic met with negative to mixed results. In my opinion, he may have bit off more than he can chew. I admire his passion for the genre and the film has its merits but overall, the film is inferior to the original.

Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" is iconic and remains a classic. It is one of my favorite films of all time and I constantly re-watch it because I love it. The film does not rely on excess, over-the-top violence and gore to get its point across. The gore is minimal yet it overflows with tension, fear, suspense and mystery which elevates this rather simple tale to great cinematic heights. Even Roger Ebert (RIP) compared it to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Furthermore, Carpenter didn't really explain much. He simply gave us some spine-tingling images starting off with a chilling scene of a boy brutally killing his sister on a sinister Halloween night and culminating with that image of an empty yard where moments prior, Michael Myers lay dead from a gunshot wound to the head and 5 to the chest. We are left with questions. Why did this little boy kill his sister? Why did he return to Haddonfield 15 years later? Why does he stalk a shy high school student and her obnoxious friends? Why does he want to kill her? But .....do we really need to know this? Not really. Carpenter didn't even attempt to let us in on the mind of Michael Myers. Let us make up our own minds on why this evil exists. This is where I think Zombie tried too hard. The entire first half of his film is dedicated in showing us why Michael Myers became Michael Myers. In vain, he tried to give a face-less, murderous monster a soul. In doing so, he stripped away the mystery, the mythology. Also, in telling his tale he squeezed in as many unpleasant stereotypes as possible. In Zombie's version, Michael (played by Daeg Faerch as a child) was a dysfunctional, un-kept, disturbed social misfit. His mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and didn't really have the means to emotionally support her dysfunctional offspring. Her abusive, drunk boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe), who is obviously a negative influence lives with them as does Myers' egotistical, selfish, sex-crazed sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall) and let's not forget the school bully. Yuppers, I guess with so much wrong in this kids surroundings, it is understandable why he tortures small animals and is destined to become a mass murderer. In my opinion, it does not work. I do not think that there is enough time here to fully explain how a mentally sick child can turn into such an incredible, invincible mass killing machine. Zombie may have been successful in showing us how the young Myers could have become a Ted Bundy or a ""Jack the Ripper"" type killer... but never Michael Myers. Anyhow, due to neglect, emotional abuse, and mental problems, the young Myers snaps and commits some grisly murders on Halloween night. After a lengthy trial, he is found guilty of first degree murder and committed to the Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium where he is looked over by psychologist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and is visited frequently by his mother. It is within the walls of the Sanitarium that Myers begins another mental decent into madness. He becomes obsessed with making sinister papier-mch&eacute; masks. Dr. Loomis and Deborah try in vain to reach through to him but the boy just zones out and become more withdrawn until he is just an empty shell and when least suspected, commits another bloody act that proved to all the boy is a murderous psychopath. The story then jumps ahead several years. Michael (now portrayed by Tyler Mane), still withdrawn, unkempt, and massive (the guy looks to be at least 7 feet tall) escapes and returns to Haddonfield where he begins stalking the unsuspecting Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends. The rest of the film, despite some differences, is similar to the original film and follows the typical slasher formula. Lots of grisly executions, nudity and lots and lots of screaming.

As already stated, I just could not believe the chubby, androgynous, awkward blonde kid from the first part of the film became the 7 foot, invincible, hulking monster of the second half. It was not believable to me. I do appreciate that Zombie tried to take the tale in another direction and I did not expect him to give us a total rehash of the original film. Had he done so, he would have been criticized for not being original. In a tale like ""Halloween"", less is more and Zombie simply put, gave us too much. The atmosphere is also lacking. The ominous dark tones of the original was shoved to the side to make room for some trashy, unlikeable, uninteresting characters and lots and lots of vulgarity. This does not mean the film has no merits. As a slasher film, it delivers and this version out-does the original in sheer brutality. This Michael remains a spectacular villain. His size overwhelms and his grisly executions leave us no doubt he has a bone to pick with humanity. There are also some unsettling images such as those scenes that show a voiceless, withdrawn child in a psychiatric ward wearing sinister papier mch&eacute; masks. I just wished the rest of the film was this effective. Watch it for the gore, the spills, and for some of the performances (Malcolm McDowell, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingly effective here). Try not to compare it to the original. The magic that made that film so good is unfortunately missing here.

This version is the Unrated Director's Cut and is loaded with extras - Commentary, deleted scenes, bloopers etc that should please hard-core fans of the film and its director.",1399593600,2,5697,4.79938900203666

2944118,5,B000VKL6Z2,"When you decide to fool around with a film as beloved as John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic 'Halloween', you'd better be prepared for a backlash, whether you did the original justice or not. One look at the reviews here on Amazon is proof; nearly equal amounts of 1 star and 5 star ratings. But the truth is that Zombie, for all of his artistic imperfections, did indeed do Carpenter justice with his riveting remake. And that's a rarity in itself, with the more recent reworking of 'Evil Dead' being the only other modern horror remake worthy of acclaim.
  Where Carpenter succeeded with a sparse, quiet quality to create chills, Zombie knows no such restraints. He encourages histrionics from his actors, which works when blessed with a strong cast (see 'The Devil's Rejects', still his strongest work). In 'Halloween's case, a bit less could have been more, but overall the performances are gritty and appropriate to the subject matter. Of course, the primary question is: Is it scary? Oh, yes. Much like Carpenter, Zombie understands that the mood you create is crucial. Zombie's 'Halloween' will leave you shaken and unsettled.",1399075200,,1134,4.994708994708994

2944120,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie couldn't make an original film if he tried, all the solo projects that aren't remakes were just regurgitated versions of classic horror films. Come original at least. This filth continues to recycle itself and used a hillbilly family type atmosphere he uses in all his movies to creep us out like the original Texas chainsaw. Sorry Rob stick to music.",1399075200,,362,4.854838709677419
2944121,1,B000VKL6Z2,"So many things that made the original Halloween an instant classic was the ""why"" behind Michael Myers. I remember watching the original as a child and being scared out of my mind, not by the gruesome acts but by the ""why was he doing it?"" When his parents came upon him after he killed his older sister, he was silent, his eyes were dead, he stood there without an ounce of remorse, THAT is scary. THAT is what aids in the suspense of a true classic.

This movie... failed in so many ways, I couldn't even watch the whole thing. The Michael character was just pointless. There are a ton of people who come from lives like that who do not turn killer. Rob Zombie wants to say that a dysfunctional childhood creates killers? This Michael Myers was not scary, he was an emo waste.

I was not rooting for any of the characters. If you like true classics, just stick to the original.",1398902400,,878,4.347560975609756

2944127,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Well that's 30 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I don't care that with my 'Prime' account it was free, my time is more valuable than this horrible remake. People have commented that they like it because it explains his childhood from the original, where he went bad, (A) that's not enough to make a movie worth watching, and (B) in the original his childhood doesn't matter, the kid/murderer/psycho was simply born with no soul, which by the way makes him even spookier. Trying to relate this to the original doesn't even make any sense as in the original Michael wasn't born into a white trash, low class family with mom stripping and a pole dancer and his dad wasn't a lazy, non-working, alcoholic child abuser. The original Halloween was a classic, they should never try to remake a classic, especially if they're going to go so low budget. I said that this took 30 minutes of my time, well that's actually not true, I fell asleep pretty shortly after it started. That should tell you something. Not to mention how dark all of the scenes are, that put a decent strain on my eyes. This is nothing like the original, just a bunch of gore so if that's what you're into then go ahead and watch it. Me? I prefer to actually be scared when watching a 'scary' movie, not bored to tears. I cannot in any good faith recommend this movie. Stick to the original. Whoever made this version should be ashamed!",1398470400,,1406,4.49609375
2944128,2,B000VKL6Z2,"So I liked the backstory. I really did. Yeah, it's cliched, and a little unbelievable, but I liked it all the same. Kudos to the actor who played young Michael Myers, he does a great sweet-and-adorable as well as a creepy-as-heck kid.

The film started to lose me with the teenage girls. They didn't talk like any teenage girls I've ever heard; in fact, the dialogue was so poorly written it seemed satirical, which does not have a place in this movie. Every word out of their mouths was laughable and made me hate them more and more.

On that point, not a single one of the characters was likable, which I feel is a huge drawback for a horror movie. The audience needs to be rooting for somebody but honestly, but the end I just wanted Mr. Myers to shut everyone up. Even Laurie, dear Laurie, was obnoxious and rude and there was really no reason to feel sorry for her or want her to live.

Last up, the sex. More specifically, the rape. There was a rape scene in this movie that was wholly, utterly, completely unnecessary. It did nothing to advance the story line and only made me uncomfortable watching it. It's really not good when the most uncomfortable part of a horror movie is rape that didn't need to be there in the first place.

Thanks for trying. It had potential, but it got lost somewhere along the way and ended up something I only barely don't regret watching.",1398297600,,1377,4.430830039525691
2944129,3,B000VKL6Z2,This movie has all of the brutality you would come to expect from a Rob Zombie film. This just can't take the place of the original Halloween movie though. It's definitely worth a watch if you have Amazon Prime.,1398211200,,211,4.435897435897436
2944130,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie seems to love mixing white trash with the morbid. This movie is no exception. Though that is the case, I do feel like this movie did a much better job explaining some of the motivations behind Michael Myers. It also did a great job of building anticipation that preceded Micheal's return to his hometown.

What I really appreciated (other than being creeped out by the movie) was how Rob honored the first movie. There were many ties to the first film and it seemed to choose honoring the first movie over Rob's own twisted aspirations. Some of the shot sequences of the girls walking down the sidewalk with Michael in the background, along with the music from the first movie were used beautifully.

I'm not a huge fan of horror films, but I appreciated this one.",1398211200,,775,4.608695652173913
2944131,4,B000VKL6Z2,"It is definitely worth a view if you have a place in your heart for classic 70's and 80's horror. I grew up watching the Saturday Creature Feature and the Midnight Madness on my local UHF station. This brand and style of horror had narrative and characters you actually rooted for. This was the golden age of horror before CGI and torture porn took the style and substance away from horror movies. Michael Myers will always be a true legend in the horror cannon of my youth. I appreciated what Rob Zombie did with the film staying close to the source material but tweeking some of the vision of the film. Watch it for the glimpse into the childhood of Michael Myers and the relationship that was developed between he and Dr. Loomis during Michael's time in the mental institution. Malcom McDowell is great as Dr. Loomis and truly channels his inner Donald Pleasence. I was always curious about this relationship in the original Halloween. The second half of the film is the traditional teens having sex while being stalked and slaughtered by the unstoppable maniac. Tyler Mane does a great job acting out the mannerisms of a silent but insane killer. Kudos to Daeg French who played the young Michael Myers. His sweet youthful innocence is nicely balanced with the underlying force of brutality that lurks beneath the surface. I also appreciate all of the winks and nods to the classic Halloween, Mr. Sandman and Don't Fear the Reaper anyone? Also keep your eyes open for the cameos of the great horror actors we grew up with. Though they have bit parts, it is great to see them on screen again, especially Joe Grizzly. This is definitely the the better of the two Rob Zombie Halloween films as the second film focuses to much time on the supposed psychological mechanisms that drives Michael Myers. While I love Rob's wife as a b movie diva, there is a limit to how many scenes one can tolerate of her in a wind blown gown urging her son to reunite the family. So enjoy this film for what it is, a modern interpretation of a true classic. Afterall, there are so many Saw and Paranormal Activity movies one can tolerate.",1398038400,,2120,4.611111111111111

I myself am not a drunk, a pervert, a stripper or exotic dancer, and I'm not a drug addict or a rapist or a serial murderer. So maybe that's why I have no empathy for any of his characters. They all seem like they were intended as mere psycho-fodder, so where's the drama? The Michael Meyers character especially is neither menacing nor sympathetic. He's just an ugly moon-faced brat who needs 2 in the brainpan. His family and victims all feel like they were destined to be killed in some grisly way that matches their dissolute existence. So where's the story? Who cares?",1396396800,3,888,4.55625

2944175,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Disgrace of a reimagining.  Rob Zombie loves the over the top white trash characters.  While that is not my style, it clearly is his style, and that's fine.  The problem is that it is not effective in the story that is being told.  Michael Myers in the original series was scary because there was no understanding of why he was so ""evil"".  Zombie's masked killer is a product of an epically dysfunctional family/upbringing.  In the classic debate of nature vs nurture he is a classic case of nurture.  Thus students in an intro to psychology class could explain his maniacal behavior.  Michael Myers is not supposed to be a grown up, damaged psychopath.  Michael Myers is the very personification of evil.  There is no obvious cause, he is simply evil.  Zombie's Michael Myers is not so much evil as he is in need of psychological therapy and some powerful medication.",1395878400,12,868,4.72

A little bit more brutal than the original and full of cursive language (they use the F word a lot) it is sometimes harder to watch.  But a lot of the original scenes are recreated with different actors and actresses so it sometimes looks like the original.  The cinematography is better and the direction is pretty intense... I like the new Dr. Loomis and the kid who plays Michael.  Michael really turns into something horrible and is sometimes hard to look at.  Fast paced, brutal, bloody and intense, it might be scarier than the first although it was the newness of the first that gave it real shock value and that, I admit, is missing here.  We are all too used to being shocked I suppose.  I would suggest this movie for anyone who likes horror movies.  It is a good remake.",1395878400,,856,4.4423076923076925

The failing in this movie comes from Rob Zombie's attempt to bring that realism to the character of Michael Myers by making him nothing more than a disturbed child that becomes a ruthless killing machine.  This movie makes Michael Myers, originally portrayed and the epitome of evil, as nothing more than a sad product of his environment.  This detracted from the main story for myself, as it is not in line with the original movie, but Rob Zombie makes up for this with the intensity of the movie.",1395705600,,669,4.6525423728813555

As an audience member it was very good to know more about Michael Myers' family history...how he became evil incarnate, and how he drops further into madness.  Most remakes of 1980's horror flicks are not good.

2944184,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I am a horror movie junkie. My all time favorite horror movies were the original Halloweens. John Carpenter was and is a cinematic genius. When I heard that a remake of the original Halloween I was excited and skeptical. I was excited since Halloween would be coming alive again, I was skeptical since I didn't know how anyone could possibly come close to creating a piece even in the same league as the original. In a addition I was curious as to why it was even needed to be attempted to the first. Although, I was going in with a low bar of hope, I still wanted to see how it was due to the fact that I loved horror movies and am quite the analyst.
I have to say, I hated this film. There was nothing about it that I enjoyed. I barely felt the unknown or suspense that I had felt with the original. The movie added unnecessary elements, such as some of his history. The fact that we didn't know a lot of his history in the original made him a scary figure since it seemed like he was just killing to kill. They also made him quite large, which took out the scary element as well. Yes, the original Michael Meyers was tall but he was still an apparent human man. And the fact that he was just like any other man's size was scary since he could be so evil at the same time. They also added a rape scene in this movie. Totally unnecessary and extremely distasteful. Added nothing to the story. If you are going to add in extra scenes to make it your own, it should strengthen the movie not make it worse. Overall, I felt like there was too much gore. The pure scare of the original was the suspense and not seeing exactly what was occurring when Michael was always killing. It gave the audience the chance to imagine what terrifying things he did. I didn't get the same eeriness of camera angles, the characters seemed out of sync, Laurie Strode was increasingly annoying and stupid, Dr. Loomis was quite the cocky jerk as well and never seemed helpful or like the guardian that he was appointed in the original. I just thought it was a mess and was an awful experience. I felt like Rob Zombie took a classic and just decided to add a lot of gore and extreme death scenes, but really not adding a real feel of true scary. Anyone can have a man stab violently with a lot of blood, which is what he did. He doesn't seem to know the know the true essence of terror or how to portray evil. In this case, the remake of Halloween does not even begin to compare to original.

Side note, sometimes remakes can actually take over the reputation of the original which is devastating in this case since a lot of young people hadn't seen the original and went and saw this instead and didn't have anything to compare it to, thinking that this was ""awesome"". Halloween, 1978, was an amazing classic and will forever stand as being not only significant in the horror genre but in cinematic history.",1395532800,3,2884,4.311233885819521

My rating is within the context of this genre of movie, which I rarely watch .  I thought some of the dialogue and non-action acting was on the weak side, but acceptable.  Good story line, good horror suspense.  I'll check out another Rob Zombie production after watching this...that is the next time I'm in the mood for horror.

This was far from a fresh angle. It was the same pathetic attempt at pandering to a dumbed down society with the cliche dysfunctional family that drove the boy to kill. WRONG!!! Did Rob even watch the original movie in the first place. It wasn't a very long scene. Also Dr. Loomis mentions the fact a few times through some of the movies that the Michael had no reason to do the killing and that was what fascinated Loomis to the case. However it was explained that Michael's middle class NORMAL family from a NORMAL middle class neighborhood comes home that night from a Halloween party and as everyone slept he slaughtered his family without rhyme or reason with NO MOTIVE! Which made his character alot more vicious and scary then this version. All this Mike was just an abused Jeffrey Dahmer animal killing wannabe from a bad home. Where mommy was a stripper, sissy was a whore, and step daddy an abusive prick. I wish Rob had just stuck to his original 1000 Corpses family and not killed them off. This version is disappointing but still enjoyable enough to watch.",1395446400,,1242,4.5

2944190,5,B000VKL6Z2,"FIrst of all, as a remake this movie does have some problems but as just another movie it's pretty darn good. The biggest changes actually didn't bother me as I enjoyed seeing Michael's backstory and actually felt for him in this movie, along with most characters. The overall tone of the movie was a refreshing change from the moderatly dark tones of the previous 5 films. Also a good plus was the violence aspect, and unlike the Friday the 13th movies this film got it right in that, I felt for the characters when they died in gruesome ways.

I should mention that in this movie past characters are portrayed differently from their counterparts. Loomis is a lot more action in this movie, Laurie's friends feel like they are less helpless (albeit just as stupid) and Laurie herself was more interesting to watch as this time, you don't know if she'll make it.

Now this movie does have a good amount of problems. People of course won't enjoy the characters acting differently, the problem with every movie, in that Michael is never noticed. Finally the biggest issue of, this movie has way to much bad language. Now usually I'm not annoyed by bad language, I'm a big fan of Pulp Fiction and Hell's Kitchen, but in this movie it was off the charts. Most annoying is the Laurie's first scene has her simulating a sexual act. Movie's can have the first showing of the protagonist doing stuff like that, but here it didn't work. I had a somewhat hard time feeling for Laurie given that first scene.

All in all, it was good for me, but won't be good for many others.",1393545600,,1565,4.542553191489362

2944194,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I have always been a huge Halloween fan. Halloween was one of the first horror movies I watched growing up. The original movie is a classic in every way. Everything about the original (acting, music, plot) is spot on.

Now I was feeling mixed emotions when I heard Halloween was going to be remade. Most likely because it's rare to find a decent remake to a movie. I kind of gave up hope on remakes especially after watching The Fog remake. That movie sucked on all levels! But I wanted to give this remake a chance especially as I am huge Halloween fan.

After watching the first half of the movie, I will give Rob Zombie credit where it's due. He came from a different angle. He focused the first half of the movie on Michael's childhood. There was way to much talking. So much talking - I was falling asleep!

Then it started to pick up after Michael is about to escape the hospital. What I was incredibly sickened by was having a rape scene in the movie. What the hell was Rob thinking putting a scene like that in this movie? Thank heavens, the forward skip button on the remote control exists.

When we meet the characters, I was quite shocked by the amount of sexual references each character makes. I mean each character was incredibly boring. The actress playing Laurie Strode was constantly screaming. Giving me a complete headache. Even the actor played Dr Loomis was boring. The violence in this movie was incredibly horrible. Way to strong!

I know with your average horror movie, you'll get the nudity, sex scenes and gore. But this movie was almost filled with too much of it. The only good thing about this movie was the music but that couldn't save it.

So if you enjoy a horror movie with a lot of sex and violence. Then this is the movie for you!

But if you enjoy your average horror movie, stick with the original.

2944207,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I like Rob Zombie. Met him a couple times and seems like a humble, normal person. I am not sure what all went wrong here. I think it is a tale of studios, trying new things, and a script that just wasn't very good. The killing in this film turns into weirdness at some point. At that time you also start picking apart the script. And then the house of cards starts falling down. The whole premise just has an aura of amateurish killing delight that the reality of it becomes more stupid the more you watch.

We all know America and beyond is messed up and produces the worst of the worst. But when you give life to these stories you need to make them real. Part of the problem here is that everything just starts becoming a carnival and this isn't Devil's Rejects. That was a great film. Really, it was. This one isn't even half that film. Someday I guess I am supposed to watch a director's cut. Well, I almost walked out of the theater for this film it was so bad. So.... idk about that. But I think now that he is back to making his own films the quality has gotten much better again.

The source material for this isn't exactly the greatest stuff in the world as far as realism or script goes. Well, imo, this film needed a healthy dose of realism to go along with its insane kill scenes. And it just doesn't have it here. Loomis and the like are just imbecilic in their roles and the way these guys go about trying to stop the killer is just absurd at this point. I couldn't get into this and believe a single moment even for a second and that is never good with horror in my opinion. I like subtle horror. If you are going to make a maniac and make him brutal then do it right. When you make this guy stupid, monster-like, and damn near sci-fi I just lose everything here I needed to like the film.

It becomes a circus and one that is deplorable, violent, and empty inside. If this film was more subtle, had less kills scenes but made them matter with more realistic dialogue in the social scenes I might have cared. As is half-way through you just start realizing you are watching kill scene after kill scene with no real point.",1385856000,8,2136,4.230392156862745

2944209,2,B000VKL6Z2,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic...

Halloween (2007) is a remake (yes, a REMAKE) of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), a classic of the horror genre.  Rob Zombie decided he wanted to remake Carpenter's classic and he turned it into an all-out gore fest that leaves nothing to the imagination.  We see lots of brutal killings, lots of nudity, and worst of all, Zombie gives a back story on Michael Myers which explains why he ended up being a killing machine.  I thought Michael Myers is the boogeyman.  The boogeyman shouldn't have a back story.  There shouldn't be any explanation of why Myers ends up a mass murderer.  When an explanation is given, it makes the viewer think, ""Well, this guy is just a typical serial killer, nothing unique about him.""  It totally destroys any mystery about the boogeyman/Michael Myers.  In the original movie, Myers was a guy with a playful side and we didn't know too much about him, other than that he escaped from a mental institution.

This movie doesn't do it for me.  The only decent thing about this movie is the autumn/Halloween atmosphere, which is a big improvement over the original, but that's it.  I added one star because of this.

There shouldn't have ever been a remake done.

Leaving the ""reason"" behind his strange, evil behavior to the viewers imagination is way scarier... now it just looks like a violent, sad family life that sparked his rage.

I like it more every time I see it, much like the original film, which I still think is superior, but that is not to say that this film does not have it's merits.  It is a great film in its own right.  If the Carpenter film is about the evil that is unknown that is out there in the world, then Zombie's film is trying to make us look very hard into the idea of myth and history and what is really there.  Many people have seen this film as a biopic or trying to be to analytical of the original film, but I have to say that Zombie is trying to construct the mid american mysticism.  Most people in this country believe in ghosts.  It is because of religion and pop culture that we believe in things that allow us to look at a child murderer that is cute as a button and say, well, he must be possessed by a demon or a celtic deity.  The reality is that he probably came from an abusive home that is pretty typical in American life.  The film does not pick a particular period to be placed, but feels generally nostalgic of a memory of what American is supposed to be.

I know a lot of reviewers have commented on the cursing.  There is no character development they say.  I am not so sure that kids that age have fully developed anything.  I remember my friends getting together and just cursing and telling dirty jokes because it masked our insecurity.  The articulate teen is the inner dialogue that we remember thinking in those situation that becomes the memory of what happened.  This film goes directly into the face of the memory of the America that was and deconstructs it and terrorizes it.

I thought I should also comment on the director's cut vs. the theatrical cut.  Unlike many special editions, there is very little difference between the two films.  Some people have commented that the theatrical version is much better paced, while I myself prefer the director's cut in terms of message, but I can definitely see why people would prefer the other as it does flow better.  It is a shame that with all the different editions that have come out, that they haven't offered both versions of the film at the same time, but if I was only going to ever own one, I would go with the director's cut.  The reason that I have the theatrical cut on DVD as opposed to Blu Ray, which is the director's cut is on, is because if I am on the go, my DVD is more accessible.  The biggest difference being the escape sequence where Michael takes on several guards.  Another big difference is that Dr. Loomis dies in the theatrical version.  All this seems to focus on Michael as this unstoppable monster, where the slower pace of the director's cut focuses more on Michael as the victim.  It is a little slower and more methodical.",1378598400,3,2757,4.341796875

2944244,4,B000VKL6Z2,"*WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers*

As every horror movie fan is aware, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a classic, this is Rob's vision & not a total remake, so it's quite different than the original, hence the ""reimagining"" part.

The Movie: Overall, it's similar to the original & yet it's very different. Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is significantly darker, gory & has way more profanity, no big surprise there if you've seen Zombie's other films. There is more of a back story with Michael Myers, I understand some fans liked that whereas other fans of the original didn't, many preferred the mystery with Michael Myers. I personally preferred the actors performances in the 1978 version, but again, that's just my opinion. I found that in some scenes the girls were rather irritating to watch when they interacted with one-another & were over-acting at times to ensure that the audience knew they were close. Scout Taylor-Compton did a decent job, I'd never seen her in anything prior to this, I know that when the film was announced she got some flack for portraying Laurie Strode, mainly because she was famously played originally by Scream-Queen, Jamie Lee Curtis & it was a tough role to beat. One of the biggest differences I noticed in this from the original is that it's no secret, to the audience, that Laurie Strode (aka, Boo) is Michael myers' little sister; John Carpenter didn't release that information to fans until ""Halloween 2"".

The BluRay: Works well, no issues with playing it. If I'm not mistaken, there are quite a few special features, I haven't watched it in a while, but from what I remember they were pretty decent.

Overall: I recommend giving it a watch. You can't say you're a true Halloween fan unless you've seen the entire series!",1370476800,3,1769,4.886666666666667
2944245,5,B000VKL6Z2,"for the most part i find that remakes just aren't as good as the originals, but in this case i'm proven wrong. love what was done with it.",1369008000,,138,3.9642857142857144
2944246,5,B000VKL6Z2,"All you haters should just shut up or make your own movie and prove that you can make something better.  I thought the white-trash element at the beginning of the movie showing Michael's upbringing was perfect.  It was simultaneously gritty and funny in a way that few directors would have been able to pull off.  And it was exactly what was needed to bring the viewer into the movie and show us SOME of what contributed to the monster Michael became.  I emphasize ""some"" because I've seen reviews where it is claimed that Mike Myers is supposed to be just pure evil and was born that way.  Well what's to say that that isn't the case?  He just had some extra grief in the form of abusive step-dad, abusive sister, abusive schoolmates to contribute to his psychopathy.  He started off killing animals and being obsessed with dead animals.  That isn't something that just occurs because of poor upbringing.  Jeffrey Dahmer had a fine upbringing and look what he turned into.

People complained about bad acting.  I thought the acting was just fine, even from the young girls.  It had good music, as all Rob Zombie films do.  I saw nothing wrong with Malcolm McDowall's lines as some people have complained about.  Sheri Moon's acting was top-notch.  She has become one of my favorite actresses for being able to take on harsh roles while still being able to act sweet at the same time.  As someone who I think has been thrust into movies and didn't aspire to become an actress, she has done well.  She has progressed in her acting ability since The Devil's Rejects.

It saddens me to see all the negative reviews from people who just can't get over the fact that Rob made something original and didn't just remake the exact same movie.  Maybe this is why I saw Rob say in an interview that he is done making horror movies.  Rob, I hope you reconsider, because the horror movie world needs you.

And as a disclaimer, I'm not a fan of Rob Zombie's music, despite the fact that I love metal.  His directing and screenwriting on the other hand, is sheer brilliance.",1367712000,3,2060,4.5710382513661205
2944247,4,B000VKL6Z2,"John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is one of the best horror films ever made, a true classic in every sense. It had the formula to which every other horror film after would use time and time again. It also introduced the world to one of the most terrifying forces of evil to ever grace the silver screen: Michael Myers. For me, the idea of someone remaking a classic horror like this is outrageous. The original ultimately proves best. Which is why I have given this four stars instead of five. But only for that reason and that reason alone.

Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is a complete re-imagining of the Michael Myers legend. We see Michael's home life post killing his eldest sister, as a troubled young boy obsessed with killing small animals and being picked on by bullies. His violent nature is already pre-determined in the first five minutes of the film which begs the question that Mr. Zombie places before us: Nature vs. Nurture. I'd like to think Michael was an ignored child but ultimately he was born evil. His mother tries hard to be there for her son, but with working nights as a stripper and making ends meet without the help of her lazy lump of a boyfriend she simply doesn't have the time. Growing up in this sort of environment you can't help but feel sorry for Michael in some aspects, but not everyone who comes from a dysfunctional or abusive home turns into a vicious killing machine. After Michael murders his mother's boyfriend, his eldest sister, and her boyfriend he is arrested and sent to a Mental Facility under the guidance of Dr. Sam Loomis. After years of analysing and trying to get through to Michael, 20 or so years pass and Loomis eventually gives up. Then of course Michael escapes and returns to his hometown and the rest is history.

I can see perfectly clear where Rob Zombie was trying to go with this and I appalled him that he has in some ways pulled it off. I myself had my doubts, especially after seeing Rob Zombie's previous films HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. I think he knew that he had to treat this film with more respect considering the original's vast amount of fans who are just itching to troll him with negative comments about how he's ruined the series. No one can ruin the mark that the original film has left and in no way has this remake hurt it in any way shape or form. Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN isn't perfect, but it's better than most remakes Hollywood is chugging out.",1367366400,3,2437,4.548974943052392

2944249,5,B000VKL6Z2,This is the same Rob Zombie Halloween take only this theatrical versin has a much different break-out scene with a higher body count that I thought was much better.

2944250,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I am a Hardcore Halloween fan. I've seen all of them. This obviously pales in comparison to the original Halloween but we shouldn't compare. Scout Taylor Compton was awful in this. She was the biggest disappointment in the film. Malcom Mcdowell had the difficult task of trying to create a new Dr. Loomis after Donald Pleasence had cemented his place in history as one of the most beloved and greatest horror protagonist and hero. He was viewed as an honorable man here he is different. Dr. Loomis cares for Myers, wants to protect the teenagers from him but is also a little into himself trying to make money off his book. Danielle Harris was awesome in this. She gave stellar performances in Halloween 4 and 5 which made it feel nostalgic. A touch of the old with the new.
  Harris was great in the role of Annie and made up for Compton's atrocious performance. A nice touch is having most of the cast of The Devils Rejects make cameos in Halloween. It's nice to see Sid Haig, Bill Mosley and others in here. Brad Douriff is a great actor. He did good in this and played a bigger part than his character did in the original version. His character was the most likable in the film. Daeg Faerch did a great job in this. I thought he gave one of the best performances in the movie as a young Myers. He looked the part and did a great acting job. Sherri Moon Zombie did pretty good in this one as Myers mother. I found her to be likable and her acting was not bad in this film.
  The first half of this movie seems to be all Rob's vision and then the second back to the original story. I think overall hardcore fans of the series will enjoy this film. I think Rob Zombie fans will like it. I think you have to try to be fair to it. No one is going to equal what Carpenter did but this movie is still fun. I think some people may not have liked the different take on Dr. Loomis character I think there will only be one Dr. Loomis but it was good they took his character in another direction instead of a carbon copy of Pleasence. So my two favorite things about this movie was Malcom Mcdowell and Danielle Harris. We had a quality actor playing Loomis and a actress who was a big part of the original franchise. I recommend this movie to all horror fans. Cheers!",1364601600,3,2259,4.271028037383178
2944251,5,B000VKL6Z2,Rob zombies remake was very cool yeah never better than the original but it was an awesome movie. He brings you in side of Michael Myers and shows why he went mad and was unstoppable. Great idea and writing...,1363046400,,209,4.384615384615385
2944252,5,B000VKL6Z2,I would order again and I loved the movie. It was fast service and good movie quality to watch .,1362873600,,96,3.85
2944253,4,B000VKL6Z2,"There generally are two camps for this movie. People who hate it and think it should never have been made and people who love it. I am actually somewhat in between. Although I do lean toward liking it, it is not as good as the original. There is a definite effort here to establish a back story for Michael and to try to explain why he turned out the way he did. Whether it works or falls flat is pretty much a matter of subjectivity. Part of what made the character scary is that there was no explanation in the first one for why he killed his sister in the beginning. In this one you get the impression that he kills her because she is mean to him and does not take him Trick or Treating on Halloween. He also kills the sister's boyfriend and alcoholic step dad. I do however like how they showed how the mom reacted to everything. I also liked how they developed the Loomis Meyers relationship over time.

Once the 15 year time jump happens the film stays closer to the original, but is not a shot for shot remake. While some of the scenes and lines from the original are recreated, it is ultimately a different movie. Some people like that and some hate that, but if you are expecting an exact remake of the original movie you will not get it.

The two things I did not like about the movie was how they kind of made Loomis into a publicity seeker (by having him write the book) and that only gets worse in the sequel to this. I also did not like the casting for the adult Michael. Tyler Mane is a 6'7"" ex pro wrestler. Part of what made Michael Myers scary in the first place was the fact that he was a normal size guy who could not be stopped. You take a 6'7"" guy who can throw people around like a rag doll and you automatically think unstoppable, and it is laughable when anyone tries to fight back. That may have been what they were going for, but when you have a guy that cannot be knocked down then you lose the dramatic effect of him getting back up.

I did like the casting otherwise. I thought Scout Taylor Compton did a good job as Laurie, although she was not the meek character that Jamie Lee Curtis played in the first film. However given that this was made three decades later, they really did have to update how the teenagers and even the younger kids acted to make it something that would appeal to the audience. I also liked how they gave Danielle Harris (the little girl from Halloween 4 and 5) a large role in this movie.

There is also a lot more gore in this one than the original. One of the hallmarks of the first movie is that there was very little blood. Given today's horror movie climate, and who was directing the movie, there was of course going to be a lot more blood and gore in this one. By now anyone who was likely to see this already has. But if you have not, then I would say if you are a fan of the series and do not have a how dare they mess with the original attitude, then check this out. If the though of a remake makes you wince then probably skip it.",1362787200,3,2998,4.146048109965636

2944258,5,B000VKL6Z2,I was not to thrilled with some of Rob Zombie's earlier films but this is perfect. This film had me reminiscent of slasher horror films of long ago. Michael Myers has always been an icon of evil and often times that representation of pure evil becomes diluted in iconic horror characters. That will not be a problem with this film.,1358726400,,331,4.533333333333333

2944260,3,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a good remake of an classic. Although Rob Zombie's movies are typically over the top in gore this one appeared to be slightly toned down. I liked the new take on Michael Myers. Rob gave him a little more background and the physical presence to match the emotional rage the original character must have felt. I think the key to Rob Zombie evolving into one of the ""Horror Masters"" is going to be him learning to leave a slight bit to the imagination. I see him playing with this concept in this movie as compared to some of his others.",1358208000,,542,4.323529411764706

2944262,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Why remake a perfect film? Rob Zombie asked himself this same question when it came to making and directing this movie. There are several reasons why Michael Myers (also known as The Shape) endures as a horror icon. One reason is because John Carpenter's 1978 classic was the first film since Psycho (1960) to really create a memorable horror movie villain. Another reason might be that Halloween was such a well made film that it has become a benchmark of the horror genre. So why remake the movie? Your guess is as good as mine. It could be that we have been living in an age of big budget Hollywood remakes for about 10 years now. And who better than to make this production a reality than Rob Zombie who did 2 really solid horror flicks before this (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects).

The problem is that the 2007 Halloween remake, while it adheres to the basic story elements of the original, it takes Michael Myers and his supporting characters out of the comfort zone that Halloween fans were in and turns these beloved characters into shadows of their former selves.

Michael Myers becomes a product of abuse and a trailer trash upbringing and that is to serve as his motive for being a psychotic killer. The mystery that existed in the original film is removed. Laurie Strode starts out close to the original portrayal as offered by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, a shy wallflower, but by the end of the film she is little more than a rebellious, psychologically scarred teenager. Dr. Loomis is played as wholly different than in the original film as well... He is a much colder and stranger personality and less of a serious psychiatrist bent on helping or stopping his mad patient. The rest of the characters, Michael Myers family, and others seem very unbalanced as the film progresses as well and don't really seem to serve much purpose. His mother for example is a stripper, concerned more about her dancing at the beginning until her son kills and is put into an asylum. Then all of a sudden she becomes a caring and nurturing mother.

It is an entertaining reimagining and the scenes in the mental hospital were a nice touch, but ultimately it lacks what true fans of Halloween wanted, a suspenseful, holiday-centric, horror movie.",1356825600,,2261,4.690176322418136

All the characters are unrealistically despicable and the added kills to the beginning of the story take away from any actual shock that was intended to exist. It's also bogged down by needless socio-political commentary, goofy shot choices and a lack of understanding of the source material.

You weren't supposed to sympathize with the killer in the original film, you weren't supposed to know his intentions, BECAUSE HE'S NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER. The point of Michael Myers was to create a modern version of a movie monster, a dehumanized force of violence that didn't care about what it was doing. All this film does is make Michael Myers into a whiny brat who's given the worst psychotherapist in a world where all the characters are despicable a-holes.

As soon as I read news that a remake was in the works I was a little dissapointed at first because of the way ""Reurrection"" ended. But when I went to the theater to seen this one my mouth dropped. I was so pleased. I knowdist that Rob Zombie helmed it as well. Before I was a little nervious at first because I hated ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". But if it wasn't for it's sequel ""The Dvil's Rejects"" then I would have said ""no"" entirly to this one. From the moment this one started I knew I would like it. I loved how Zombie devided the story in three acts. The first is showing Michael's childhood and what made him snap. The second showed him in the mental hospital then the third when he breaks out and goes after his sister.

It gave us an idea,to what made him snap. Including his mother's emotional abusive boyfriend and how Michael was harrassed and bullied at school. I thought it was a really good idea to get us familiar with the character of Michael Myers,before turning into a full-blown killer.

It's got some the greatest horror icons from the last 30+ yrs:

Malcolm McDowell, William Forsythe, Danielle Harris, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Clint Howard, Dee Wallace, Ken Foree, and Sid Haig.

With some great characterization from new comers Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Sheri Moon Zombie, Skyler Gisondo and Jenny Gregg Stewart (plays young Lindsay Wallace, who will blast your ears off with her freaking screams geez!).

This is brutal an raw if you want pg-13 horror look away, its got enough cuss words to rival Scarface and more than enough blood and gore to satisfy even Jeffrey Dahmer's eclectic tastes.

Like it or hate it is different, the basic structure is there but that's what made Halloween ""Halloween"" it'd be like Friday the 13th without the lake and counselors.

Watch a new spin on an old classic and take it for what it is; a homage, a re-imaging, and most of all a good time.",1350864000,,1032,4.807909604519774
2944282,4,B000VKL6Z2,"When Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" first came out, despite my initial reaction to anyone trying to remake Carpenter's classic, I went to see it in the theater. I hated it! Outside of the soundtrack, I thought there was little to no value in Zombie's film.

For lack of anything better to watch I decided to give the movie another shot. I have to say I was pleasently surprised. While I still hate the opening 5 - 10 minutes or so (I think Zombie was a bit ham handed  and over the top in making sure the viewer knew Michael came from a dysfunctional family), the rest of the film was pretty gripping and interesting.

As the movie starts out, we are introduced to the Myers family. A family so dysfunctional they would have to go to therapy in order to move into a trailer park. Stripper Mom, Alcoholic and Abusive Step-Dad, Trampy older sister named Judy, Wierdo and bullied Michael and the baby Laurie. Some people didn't like that we got Michael's backstory, I was one of them initially, because it was bit creepier thinking that Mike came from a good home and just snapped like in the original. With Zombie's film we get to see what creates the hulking psychopath seen in the second half of the film. When Michael finally snaps and kills one of the bullies from his school, it starts the killing spree that will conclude on Halloween night 18 years later (or continues 18 years later once the sequel came out?).

Institutionalized because of the murders, Michael meets Dr. Loomis, a psychiatrist that initially tries to help Michael, but later exploits him and his crimes. Michael spends most of his life locked away in a small room, hiding and wearing masks of his own design until one Halloween night he decides to go home and find his little sister.

Very bloody, boob filled and violent as all get out, Zombie definately makes the story his own. Zombie's version of Michael Myers is similar to the classic portrayal of Jason Voorhees from the ""Friday the 13th"" films, an unstoppable hulking, silent killer. In the old ""Halloween"" films, Michael was the boogeyman that lurked and popped up out of the dark. If you go into this film hoping to see Michael lurking in the background, slowly sneaking up on his prey...you'll hate this movie. There is nothing subtle about the scare or Michael in this movie.

And while I don't think Zombie's version is nearly as good as Carpenter's classic, it's a good deal better than part's 4, 5, 6, & Resurrection. Zombie at least made Myers scary again.",1350604800,,2490,4.634920634920635

Then on to the really false teenage girls getting chased around, which also seemed like an eternity. bleh. Film makers need to work out the difference between gory and scary.

I love the original ""Halloween,"" but I got to admit, I like Zombie's remake better, if only for it's true to life cruel dysfunctional realism.

Zombie has not only remade the film, but he has re-created the story & has in the process, transcended the original in terms of plausibility, verses the supernatural unstoppable ""Shape."" Here we get to see the making of a serial killing psychopath machine! Outwardly, Michael is unemotional pure unadulterated evil. Inside, a smoldering anger of a young child left to ferment in his hatred of all those who surround him, & mostly, his hatred of himself.

A terrifying portrait of what can be wrought on to others by a person whose years of systematic abuse by his family, & by those who ostracize him from society, filled with malicious school bullies, to a psychologist exploiting him for personal monetary gain & fame.

I like his music and was overwhelmed with joy after House of 1000 Corpses, just because it was a REAL horror film, when all we had were ignorant 'horror' films that just tried to trash horror altogether. When I first heard that Rob was going to do a Halloween movie, I jumped for joy. I heard he was supposed to be such a huge fan of the movie and I thought if anyone could bring it back to the brilliance of John Carpenter, Rob could do it.
  I WAS WRONG.
  I think Rob must've sat and watched John's movie and said, 'Everything he DID do, I WON'T do. Everything he DIDN'T do, I WILL do.'
  Not much blood, mine will be a bloodbath.
  Not a lot of nudity, mine will have wall-to-wall t&a.
People who never got the idea that Michael Myers was supposed to be the boogeyman and he's supposed to be a supernatural entity in the shape of a human will be happy, because Rob makes Michael a 'regular' guy, making the Loomis dialogue about him being evil sound really pretentious. Also, it's funny that you can keep shooting him and stuff and he still keeps coming, despite the fact he's a 'regular' guy. You can even blast his blood and brains all over the place and he'll just wind up with a little scrape on his head.
  Sorry Rob. Have to call B.S. on that.
  I'm really trying to say that Rob Zombie just WAY OVERTHOUGHT this movie. One of the things that made the original so great was the fact the story was so simple, if you just pay attention while watching it.
  I DO like the cast a bit. Danielle Harris and Kristine Bleebe are lovely, awesome and look really good with no clothes on. Malcolm McDowell was a super choice for Loomis. Brad Dourif is always a joy to see in any movie. We get the Zombie regulars (i.e. Sherry Moon, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Ken Foree, etc.) That warmed my heart to see that.
  I am waiting with anticipation to see Lords of Salem, his next movie, but Rob should stop with remakes and make his own, original movies. This flick shows that just because you can remake movies, doesn't mean you should.
  Plus, the original Halloween is a beautiful, well-shot movie. This looks more like Rob was making a dingy, unappealinjg exploitation movie. Good stuf, but John Carpenter still rules.",1345075200,6,2317,4.373831775700935

2944306,5,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, this is a great horror movie.  Forget whether or not it's a remake.  Almost every review compares this Halloween to the original, but the point isn't to say whether it's better or worse.  The point is that Rob Zombie wanted to tell the story his way.  May I also mention that John Carpenter gave Zombie his blessing to do so?  When I read the negative reviews here and saw so many people bashed it, I decided to watch it again, just to see if it deserved the criticism I was seeing.  What I noticed is that everyone keeps pointing out the same aspects, but what I can't understand is why (especially when most reviews start out with: ""I love horror movies, but..."").  I wanted to justify the reasons why Zombie's Halloween included the things many people disliked, namely:

-Michael's trashy family and they way they talked to each other.  I'm sorry, but some families are really like this.  It's sad, but it's true.  I've lived in apartments most of my adult life and have had the misfortune of living next to white trash neighbors on more than one occassion.  I've heard comments similar to those in this movie coming through the walls when my neighbors would start up with each other.  It may have been exaggerated a little in the movie, but that's not to say it isn't far from the truth for some people.  It's reality and it's unpleasant.

-Michael's family life isn't a sufficient enough reason for him to become a killer.  Who's to say?  I've never researched serial killers' backgrounds, but don't most cases reference some abuse or molestation as a child?  In the movie, Michael's getting it from all sides--his mother's boyfriend, his sister and bullies at school.  I assume either his genetic makeup predisposed him to violent behavior and it only took a small stimulus to trigger it, or years and years of verbal (and possibly physical) abuse was enough to make him snap.

-The actor who played the adult Michael was too big.  WHAT?!?  He HAS to be big, in order to fight off everyone he encounters.  Seriously, if he were average size, would he have been able to withstand the nightstick attacks from the guards at the mental ward?  What about the trucker or the teenage boys who fight back when Michael attacks them?  If Michael were 5'6"" and 150 lbs, the likelihood of someone stopping him would be too high.  The impact alone from the gunshots he sustained would have sent him reeling.  Most horror movies get slammed because the villain has almost superhuman abilities and keeps coming back again and again, but in this case you're saying you want the killer to be smaller and more vulnerable?  Making Michael a bigger guy supports his ability to take a hit and keep on coming.

*On a related note, one thing that impressed me at the end of this movie was Laurie shooting Michael in the head.  Perhaps the biggest cliche in any movie (not just horror films) is assuming the bad guy is dead without confirmation.  Laurie repeatedly pulling the trigger on the revolver until it fired was an excellent addition to the ending.

-Gratuitous female nudity.  Yes, there's a lot.  Why?  Well, just like in every horror movie, there are teenagers experimenting with sex.  Isn't that what Friday the 13th taught us and Scream reiterated?  Having sex in a movie will get you killed?  The difference here is that Zombie doesn't sugarcoat it just for the sake of keeping the MPAA off his back.  Right before Lynda dies, she thinks she's talking to the guy she just had sex with, so she doesn't bother to get dressed before getting up to grab the beer from his hand.  Why would she, given they had just been together moments earlier?  Her dead body is then shown naked throughout the rest of the movie because Michael doesn't care if she's clothed or not.
When Annie's attacked, she has to do what she can to save her life.  She doesn't have time to put on a shirt.  I think these are more realistic depictions of those situations than most horror movies portray.  Zombie wants to evoke empathy and a feeling of helplessness from the audience by showing the girls being attacked when they're at their most vulnerable. Those same scenes could have been shot from the neck up, but they would have lost their impact.  Some people have said all that nudity doesn't make this a good movie to watch with the family.  Huh???  I hope they're not talking about kids, and if they're talking about other adults, I would assume those adults could handle a little skin.  I'm a grown man and I would have no problem watching this movie with any of my friends, male or female, as long as they knew to expect a more graphic horror experience than what most scary movies provide.

-The guys all have long hair and the teen girls act too loose.  Again, I think too many people are focusing on the original, which is generally referred to as an '80s movie (even though it came out in 1978). The remake never says when it takes place.  The opening sequence only says ""October 31,"" not the year.  I assume Michael was a child in the '70s, when it was popular for guys to have long hair.  As for the girls acting slutty, I seem to remember a few girls from high school who had a reputation for being easy, too.  Just because the girls weren't angels and the guys had long hair, this was a bad movie?  Come on.

All in all, I think the people criticizing this movie are either paying too much attention to the name on the box or are somewhat naive to the real world.  This isn't a movie to screen at your church social or when you have your mother over for tea.  Zombie has created a brutally violent horror movie that is probably about as real as you can get and still keep theatrical distribution and an R rating.  It's his response to all the PG-13 ""horror"" movies that have been mass-produced in recent years just to give the latest batch of Hollywood up-and-comers acting jobs.  It's SUPPOSED to churn the stomachs of people with decent morals.  Some people may find it too over the top, but I think it turned out exactly as it should have, given what Zombie was likely trying to achieve.",1321920000,2,6086,4.543698252069917

The first half of this film is tedious and boring and totally saps the life out of one of the greatest movie monsters of all time.
The point of the original film was that Michael Myers was evil incarnate.  By reducing him to a human serial killer Rob Zombie drives a stake through the heart of a legend, and shines a light on some of the deepest problems of our day: evil is banal, common, and totally human.
In the original film Michael was an ordinary 6 year old from a good family.  There was no human explanation for his actions on that fateful Halloween. paving the way for the acceptance that evil had taken up residence in his soul, breathing life into the boggy man.
I haven't even finished watching the new version yet, I know that it's going to be little more than a boring, bloody rehash of the original, so far the second half is just a scene for scene ripoff.  The only thing new and different is that the slut and her boyfriend are partying in the old Myers house.  Not enough to justify the waste of my time.  I'm glad that I only paid $3.99 to rent it.
I haven't seen anything approaching a sympathetic character yet.  This version's Lorie is just another dumb, vulgar bimbo who I will find it hard to root for.
And suspending disbelief to accept that this Michael is evil incarnate won't happen.
All the 5 star reviews for this film just further convinces me that imagination is dead in this society.  It's a sad fact that all it takes to keep modern movie audiences happy is gallons of fake blood poured all over the set.",1321660800,7,1562,4.347079037800687

If that doesn't demystify Carpenter's creation, everything that follows does.  Zombie has managed to do the unthinkable; he's turned an icon of horror into a sniveling creature of banality.

First we get a painfully long look at Myers childhood. His white trash parents, abusive step-father, bullies at school, etc. Myers snaps and kills a bully. Then on Halloween night he kills his step father, after strapping him down to a chair with duct tape. It beggars belief not just on a practical level, but the child playing Myers just does not seem all that disturbed. We are supposed to assume he is based on his actions, but it's not present in the performance. At all.

Then Myers is shipped off to the Mental Hospital where he meets Dr Loomis and then grows up. We are treated to many scenes letting us know what a bad ass Myers is now. Eventually Myers escapes and then a much less effective rehash of the original film is played out. None of it is the least bit scary.

That's the main problem here. It's obvious that Mr. Zombie sympathizes with the Myers character above all else. He has little love for Loomis or anyone else in this film (except Myers mother...paging Dr Freud...)

This is a love letter to fan boys of, not Halloween, but the Myers character. It's apparently societies fault that Myers goes berserk, and his victims are not so much victims, but deserving targets of Myers rage. It's something a disaffected 14 year old might come up with. The sort of sheltered poser that got all their ideas about what is ""gritty and real"" from, well, bad Halloween sequels.

I suppose none of this is too surprising, considering the cult following Myers has built up over the course of several sequels. It would have been nice to see the series dragged back to its original premise though, where Myers was not a hero and we were supposed to care about his victims.

Gone is most of the supernatural element of the original. We are firmly in fully human psycho territory here. How boring. Especially since Zombie has nothing to add, he just regurgitates all the well worn clich&eacute;s. Brain dead style over no substance.",1319932800,5,2058,4.624657534246575

2944317,1,B000VKL6Z2,"HALLOWEEN (2007)
Rated R / 109 minutes

Back in July of 2002, I sat in the local movie theater, stunned at the awfulness known as ""Halloween: Resurrection"". I couldn't fathom how someone could actually make such crap. After the film concluded, I vowed I would never see another ""Halloween"" in the theaters again. Well, fast forward to 2007 and lo and behold, I lied. In this era of filmmaking, the biggest hurtle and the worst flaw for many films is brought on by the very first step of the filmmaking process; the script. While viewing Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, ""Halloween,"" I can safely say that the film suffers the same fate.

It is no exaggeration to say that the film is filled with nothing more than half baked ideas, truly God-awful dialogue (that seriously could have been written by a rambunctious young teen) and one-dimensional characters. This new age ""Halloween"" is just filled with such mean-spirited and foul-mouthed language that it rarely sounds natural. This rings especially true during the sequences of Michael's ""white trash"" upbringing. However, you can hardly blame the poor acting performances (William Forsythe, for one) on anything other than the poor script. You can only work with what you got, and most of which is quite bad.

A major structural problem with Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the uneven three-part element to the film. Essentially, the film wants to suggest that Michael is a psychotic killer due to the abuse he's had to withstand and ultimately, Zombie tries to make Myers a sympathetic character. Consistently picked on by bullies and his mother's boyfriend, Michael eventually snaps. From some of the illogical and silly ""kill sequences"" that sets-up Michael's eventual path to the Institution to his over-the-top escape 15 years later, we learn nothing about Michael that couldn't have been stated in all of 3 minutes into the film. Basically, Myers has been reduced to a run-of-the-mill serial killer that is neither interesting nor scary. Though Zombie goes to great lengths to try and make the story resonate as being a disturbing piece of work, it often comes across as either unintentionally comical or painfully contrived. In fact, I must say the idea of the ""mood masks"" is a really bad one, and never works on screen. Tyler Mane (adult Michael Myers) looks absolutely ridiculous in them. And speaking of unintentionally funny moments; the film features the worse misuse of the classic tune ""Love Hurts"" you are ever likely to see. Furthermore, and even more troubling, Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) are no longer the lovable characters they once were. Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) is wasted and Laurie's teen friends Annie (the near 30-year-old, Danielle Harris) and Lynda (Kristina Klebe) are not only unlikeable, there's no real differences established between the two characters. In fact, nearly every character is underdeveloped and unlikable while every female character is either bitchy or slutty, but mostly both. Quite simply, Zombie's characters lack personality and individuality. They are interchangeable and often times, characters are introduced only to be dropped moments later.

After the clichd and tired way of Myers gaining his iconic mask to the killing of Joe Grizzley (Ken Foree), the 6'8 mask-wearing maniac roams the streets of Haddonfield nearly undetected. By this point of the film, it was decided to remake ""Halloween"" nearly scene for scene in rapid fire transition. Many flaws pop up during these sequences that simply defy explanation -- for one such example being; continuity. Apparently, Myers is able to be everywhere at once. From scene to scene, he is magically in a different place as if he's the genie from ""Aladdin"". Another major flaw is the fact that Zombie has assumed that everyone has already seen Carpenter's original (and even its sequel). I hope those audience members have or they will be deeply confused why Myers is all of a sudden stalking some teenage girls. It is never known previously that Laurie is his sister. In fact, the earliest part of the film refers to Laurie one time, and that is only by the nickname of ""Boo"".

It seems that the main idea was to remake ""Halloween"" into a film with a higher body count, more T & A and more gore with no regards to logic or continuity. The latter could quite possibly be tolerated, however, if the film was able to deliver any scares, suspense or even some creative kills. Instead we are lambasted with shaky-cam effects during some lame, repetitive kill sequences that can not be glossed over just by loud sound effects or by turning up the musical score. The key to making a good horror film both scary and suspenseful, you would first need characters that you can truly care about, and this film doesn't have any. If the idea was to be more of a ""complete film,"" Rob Zombie has certainly failed to deliver as he was unsure to be a prequel or a remake, and thus we are left with incoherent bits and pieces of both.

Overall, this ""Halloween"" is an unfocused mess. It's just insulting, deeply flawed (so much so I'd need twice the space to describe them all), and it entirely lacks any semblance of a cohesive unit, not to mention the severe lack of atmosphere and suspense. And while some scenes look sharp, the interaction between characters comes out as being forced and uninspired. Do yourself the favor of steering clear away from this drivel. Now, after all this, I know I can swear off future ""Halloween"" installments forever ... or so I say.",1317427200,9,5568,4.949732620320856
2944318,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie took and already awesome classic and made it better.

2944320,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Once upon a time, someone decided it would be a great idea to let Rob Zombie make a movie: the result was a piece of crap known as ""House of 1000 Corpses"". Oddly enough, someone gave him money again and he came up with an even worse piece of crap: ""The Devil's Rejects"". Though showing no real talent nor any real distinct vision, someone decided to give ol' Rob the reigns on a ""Halloween"" remake and he delivered... yet another piece of crap. Only this piece of crap is destined to be compared to a rather simple, yet effective modern horror classic and what many consider to be the springboard for the modern slasher film.

People will say it's unfair to compare this remake with the original film that inspired it, but then those are probably the same un-thinking clowns who thought this whole enterprise would be a good idea anyways. Look, it's a film called ""Halloween"" with a storyline that mirrors a previous film called ""Halloween"" - how do you not compare the two? More importantly, this remake is so inept that you really can't help but think of the original and what it did (or didn't do) more effectively. If you were doing a remake of a small foreign film that no one ever heard of, you could probably get away without much comparison, but when you remake a film this well-known, you're pretty much asking for it... and crying foul when people do so seems a little ridiculous on your part.

Side Note: that particular criticism never makes any sense because the basic argument is that you should be open-minded enough to accept a new interpretation on an old idea, but the argument really works both ways. If you tell someone the remake sucked and the original was better, they often counter with how the original sucked and the remake was better. Aren't the people who champion the remake just as guilty of being closed-minded as those who deride it? Talk about a pot/kettle moment.

With that being said, Zombie gives us almost an hour of unnecessary backstory before propelling us into the by-the-numbers slasher plot that most viewers are accustomed to. Here it is in a nutshell: Michael Myers is a pudgy demented kid who has an equally annoying family and is taunted by even more annoying bullies. One day he snaps because this is pre-Jerry Springer so he can't go on television to get it all out of his system. After an hour of this, it's more-or-less Carpenter's original film as Michael, now a human tank, hacks and slashes his way back to Haddonfield in order to do... um... something. Zombie's script combines elements of the original ""Halloween"" and elements from ""Halloween II"" and tries to make you more sympathetic to Michael's mental imbalance. There's a lot of psychological mumbo-jumbo that doesn't really go anywhere and there's lots of ambiguity concerning what Michael's ultimate goal really was.

In the meantime, you get plenty of bad acting, multiple amounts of T&A (sans Mrs. Zombie - sometimes it pays to be married to the director) and no real scares. To say it's all rather unnecessary is putting it mildly. The only real fun to be had is by hardcore horror buffs who can make a game out of spotting-the-C-list celebrity (is that Mickey Dolenz? Hey, Ken Foree! Oh, it's Dee Wallace!) This is the only cheap thrill that the film seems to muster and aside from some clever casting, the movie really doesn't have much going for it. Since it's clear that the main focus of this film is Michael Myers, all the other characters are largely ancillary. Scout Taylor-Compton proves she's totally incapable of playing a convincing teenager (hired because Zombie felt she ""wasn't too actor-y"" - truer words were never said), though it's not entirely her fault since Zombie feels more at home writing scenes that feature the worst of cussing white trash than scenes of actual believable people. Laurie's friends are largely forgettable, but it is fun to see Danielle Harris (particularly if you remember her from previous sequels to the original ""Halloween""). Here, she's mostly unnecessary and you sort of wish she was playing Laurie, though that would just send the fans of the original ""Halloween"" films into a mental geekgasm tailspin.

It's always fun to see Malcolm McDowell and Danny Trejo in nearly anything, but here they don't serve much purpose. Donald Pleasance may have only served the purpose to spout a lot of jargon about the nature of evil in the original films, but he chewed the scenery quite nicely and he's sorely missed here. Michael's nemesis, Sam Loomis, is largely underdeveloped here - so much so, that he's practically unnecessary, which is a shame because there's only so much you can do with a film centered around a walking slaughterhouse who's mute. Speaking of, there's Daeg Faerch, who plays young Michael Myers and he's horrible. Some people praised his performance, but I'm not sure they saw the same kid I did. He's unpleasant to look at (which you think would help when playing Michael Myers) and he's unconvincing. Apparently, he filmed scenes for Zombie's ""Halloween II"" but was cut because he was too tall, so they got another kid. This automatically makes ""Halloween II"" a better movie, but that's a whole other review all together.

Also, since this is a Rob Zombie film, Sherri Moon Zombie is in this and plays Michael's mother in the rather-lengthy backstory. Strangely, she's the only seemingly likable character in the whole film and seems to be the only character somewhat fleshed out (pun intended, cuz see... Michael's mother is a stripper in this film. However, paradoxically, Sherri seems to be one of the few female cast members who isn't nude in this film. Go figure.) The rest of the cast isn't of particular interest, so there's no real point in talking about them.

So, aside from some bad acting, what else makes the film seem so shoddy? Well, it's crystal clear that Zombie has an obvious affinity for late 70's horror films reminiscent of Wes Craven or Tobe Hooper, however, most horror fans won't admit that most of the horror films of that particular era just weren't very good, so it seems a somewhat odd choice of era to emulate with a film that's trying to appeal to today's youth. At any rate, there Zombie goes and succeeds in making us not like a single character on the screen. Quite a feat, really. Unfortunately, by doing this, we have no one to really sympathize with (sorry, I don't sympathize with Michael Myers either. Yeah, he had a bad childhood, but he seems just as likely to end up as Marilyn Manson as Michael Myers - the unstoppable killing machine.) With no one to sympathize with, it doesn't really matter what happens in the rest of the movie and, quite frankly, this film doesn't try really hard to generate any suspense. In that sense, I guess Zombie did succeed in emulating the likes of something like Wes Craven's original ""The Last House on the Left"": things just sort of happen and they film it, but it's not like you care about it too much.

There are also several other issues you seem to think about while watching this movie that cause you to not really care for it. For me, it was the following:

1.) What timeframe do the two halves of the movie take place in? The first half seems like the late 70's/early 80's, but the second half - supposedly taking place only 15 years later, has a clear post-2000 vibe.

2.) What is with the long hair? Nearly everyone in this film has annoying long hair (even Malcolm McDowell for quite awhile)... and it usually hangs in front of their face. WTF? This isn't scary, just annoying.

3.) If I have to watch one more horror film that features Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear The Reaper"", I will spend my own savings to buy the rights to that song just so I can not license it to anybody and I don't have to hear that song in another horror film ever again.

4.) How come Michael emphatically kills some people, but lets others live for no discernable reason? Zombie establishes earlier that Michael has no boundaries (seemingly, the reason why Danny Trejo is killed), but then he lets Danielle Harris survive and Sam Loomis is only incapacitated. Guess you can't kill fan favorites in case there's a sequel.

5.) What's Michael's plan? He kills one of Laurie's friends and places the Myers tombstone above her and then abducts Laurie and shoves a picture at her that she has no idea how to interpret. Is his plan to kill her or just resume being a family again? Sure, things are just as ambiguous in the original, but here, they went through all the effort to explain Michael, yet his motivations are still entirely unclear.

6.) In both this film and the original, how come kids (and teenagers) running down a suburban street yelling ""Help! Help!"" never elicit any response from any neighbors... ever?

7.) When Laurie called 911 to help her friend Annie (Danielle Harris), the cops show up at the house Laurie runs back to though she called to get to help at the house that Annie was in. Later, Loomis and the sherriff (as well as an ambulance) show up at the house Annie is in and seem to ignore the patrol car (with lights flashing) at the other residence that Laurie went back to. How does the emergency crew know to show up at different houses?

8.) That ""Trick or Treat"" title card... really? What was that for?

Maybe I'm too meticulous in my nitpicking, but with a boring movie, you tend to think of these things. All in all, there's nothing to recommend this movie and you're not missing much if you never see it. I would recommend picking up the original. Though it's definitely dated, it's far more effective and really utilizes the theme of the holiday (the original film used traditional Halloween lore and activities far more extensively thus making the title appropriate. In the remake, it really doesn't matter if it's Halloween or not - these events seem like they could have taken place whenever.) In the end, I'm amazed this remake got made, but then again, Zombie made two previous films before this one and I'm really amazed that those got made, so I guess this shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.

If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, you'll love this film. If you're a fan of John Carpenter, you'll definitely hate it. If you like angry rednecks yelling and swearing at each other every five seconds, you'll love this. If you like fleshed-out characters and actual acting, you'll hate this. If you enjoy gratuitous nudity and incomprehensible story plotting, you'll love this. If you enjoy competent filmmaking and a script worth being filmed, you'll hate this.

Maybe Zombie will remake ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" next because that... well, that... I'd be curious to see...

How he was allowed to even make a 3rd, especially a remake of ""Halloween"" is SO beyond me!! When I 1st saw a trailer for it I thought it was yet another awful sequel, but NO, it's a remake...UGH! This is garbage. Yes, garbage! This is a vile piece of celluloid. It's a useless remake of a film that did NOT need a remake!

Calling it a 'reimagined version' doesn't change the fact that it is still a REMAKE (and ""remake"" is just another name for ""theft""!) , and a totally unnecessary, unneeded, dreadful, awful, atrocious, sacrilige at that.

And, for the people posting on here ""Who cares about the original? It was boring and slow, and it took SO long to develop characters, which was a waste of time, cause you're just getting to know characters that are gonna get killed anyways?"", well, you all scare me more than this crap ever could! Where is your moral compass? Your moral center? Your moral core? In other words, your Human side? Just how dehumanized (not to mention how lowbrow) society has become is so frightening. Plus, you all miss the entire point of a horror movie, showing your ignorance to the mechanisms that make a scary movie successful; a rule of thumb that goes all the way back to the silent days of cinema: You MUST get to know the characters so you can feel for them, then therefore be scared when they start getting murdered.

It seems as though the mass viewing public doesn't feel the need for 'plot' these days, they just want the latest trend in being 'shocked' instead of being scared, and unfortunately they aren't educated enough to know the difference; or, they have become too dehumanized to even care. Just because Zombie loves horror does not mean he can make a good horror film.

What made ""Halloween"" so great: Pacing, and realistic situations, and realistic characters doing realistic things, and VERY creepy atmosphere and music. Plus, it is a very dark psychological film at heart. The way Michael Myers kills off Laurie Strode's friends, making sure she has no one to run to when he goes for her. And, none of them were running around a lake out in a deserted forest in the middle of the night like stupid airhheads screaming ""Here I am Mr. Murderer, come kill me!"" like they were in the senseless ""Friday The 13th"" movies, which were just clones of Carpenter's classic film. No, they were all doing very realistic things suburban teenagers (of that era) do: Smoke a bit of pot, go to school, baby sit, etc

Rob Zombie has raped/pillaged/stolen/ruined/destroyed everything that was great about this horror masterpiece (yes, masterpiece!) by tinkering around with something that didn't need fixing. He needs to be committed to the 'house of 1,000 corpses' and tortured by 'the devil's rejects' for this sacrilige! Poor Debra Hill is doing flips in her grave, for this is the second John Carpenter/Debra Hill film to be remade counting ""The Fog"". R.I.P. Debra! Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is considered a classic, and ranked among the likes of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" for a reason: It is a solid masterpiece of psychological horror, NOT just another slasher/horror film. It didn't need sequels, and sure as heck didn't need to be remade.

IF it had been a frame by frame/shot for shot remake, I might have given it a fairer shake, but to try and give 'history' to Mike Myers, and making his family look like white trash from ""The Jerry Springer Show"", well, he should have called it something else, because it is NOT ""Halloween""! I just don't find it necessary to have a 'backstory' on Michael Myers, well, other than the one that was put into ""Halloween II"", revealing that Laurie Strode was his younger sister. That was the only thing I like about ""Halloween II"", and wished there were some way to edit it into the original film.

I would urge anyone that wants to see what all the fuss is about to seek out the John Carpenter/Debra Hill classic, and see the film that has terrified audiences for over 30 years to this day, the last 15 minutes so intense, it could induce heart attacks; and forget this dog turd even exists! I mean, really, who's gonna be talking about Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" in a few years from now??? Except to say ""Avoid it like a rabid dog!"". People won't even remember it long enough to say that in another couple of years. It will fade away and rot like a rotten tomato, so it begs to question: WHY did Zombie waste his time remaking a classic when he could have at least tried to make something original (even though his 'original' films are just as forgettable as well)? This ranks in the same lowbrow category as Gus Van Zant's atrocious remake of ""Psycho"".

Sorry, but I'm trying NOT to think about anything in this film anymore. I'm trying REAL hard to forget it even exists, which really isn't that hard to do. Either way, good or bad, I do wish the remake cycle would come to a grinding halt! As for Zombie, well, I don't know what else to say, for I feel like he's a waste of breath (no offense), and his 'remake' is sucking trees out of the ground! AVOID!! Thank you!",1306454400,5,5636,4.6177644710578845

Rob Zombie should stick to what he knows best and that is music. The only people that might like this are teenagers and college aged kids who have been brain washed buy Hollywood and don't anything about when horror movies used to be good.",1305504000,2,414,4.32051282051282
2944323,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's ""re-imagination"" of the 70s classic ""Halloween"" has several pros and several cons. My rating is 3 stars. Now I will break down my reasons. The first 40 minutes of this movie are fantastic! Zombie gives Michael Myers a childhood, a family and a cause for his ""evil"". In the original, Michael was a faceless supernatural force of nature. He existed just to kill and we never really found out why. Zombie tries to dig deep into the character of Michael and he tries to humanize him. I think he succeeds in the beginning, Michael as a child, played brilliantly by Daeg Farch is a sympathetic character. He lives in a hellish 70s environment, his mother Deborah is a stripper, his sister Judith a slut, his stepfather Ronnie verbally abuses everyone in the household. Michael's only respite is his infant sister who he calls Boo. This all comes to ahead one Halloween night when Michael wants to go trick-or-treating. Mom tells Sister to take Mike out but Sis is too busy getting banged by her bf. So Mike just sits on the porch while Mom strips and the rest of the family does their thing. Mike gets revenge by going postal on the whole family except for Boo. This is different than in the original as in this movie Mike kills 3 instead of just 1. This lands him at the sanitarium where he is counseled by Dr Loomis played well by the great Malcolm McDowell. Zombie does a great casting job by getting McDowell to replace the late great Donald Pleasance in the Loomis role. The interactions between McDowell and young Farch are some of the best scenes in the whole movie. Michael has murdered his entire family except his mother and baby sister yet he claims not to remember any of it. Michael wants to leave the sanitarium but of course he is not allowed to as Dr Loomis explains because he has ""done terrible things"". Due to his incarceration, Michael is slowly delving into madness. He is obsessed with making masks of all colors and kinds. This is a clever plot twist from the original movie. One day when Michael is being visited by Mom, Michael stabs a nurse with a fork. This scene is very well done by Zombie as all we hear is a siren going off yet we see Michael screaming at his mother because she took off his mask. The movie then jumps ahead 15 years. Michael is now a long-haired giant played by Tyler Mane. He still makes masks but now he is completely mute. Dr Loomis informs Michael that he is quitting because Michael is making no progress. Michael will now be transferred to a minimum security sanitarium. As he is being transferred by 4 armed guards Michael breaks his shackles and makes mincemeat out of his guards. This scene is dynamic and it proves that Rob Zombie is great at visuals and making dramatic scenes. The last great scene of this movie is where Michael invades a truck stop and kills a huge trucker for his clothes. There is a problem here though. Time has not seemed to have passed even though 15 years have gone by during Michael's incarceration. The music and fashions are still stuck in the late 70s. That's one con of this movie. The rest of the movie is basically a waste. Instead of doing something different Zombie decides to simply reshoot the entire original movie in the 30 minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, the actors that Zombie gets to play Laurie Strode and her friends are not real actors they just use expletives a lot and try to act like teenagers even though they all look on the wrong side of 25. Scout Taylor Compton who replaces the great Jamie Leigh Curtis in the Laurie Strode role is not fit to even shine Curtis' shoes with her tongue. She is an awful actress but she is not alone. The other ""actors"" that play her friends and the kid that plays Tommy Doyle are a complete waste and I will be surprised if they ever work in a movie again at least one not made by Rob Zombie. The last part of the movie feels completely rushed and forced. It's as if Zombie used all of his creativity in the first 40 minutes and with nothing left he just decides to reshoot the original again with lousy non-actors. I think that if Zombie reflects on this movie he will realize that he made a big mistake. The original movie did not need to be reshot. Also the whole brother-sister angle should have been trashed. In the original 1978 movie John Carpenter never intended for Michael and Laurie to be siblings. His idea was that Laurie was a virgin with no boyfriend and a lot of sexual frustration and somehow her frustration summons Michael back to his hometown.  He stalks and chases her because he is trying to be her lover but tragically he can't because he is insane. It is this idea that Zombie should have used for his re-imagination. The whole brother-sister angle was a cheap way that other directors used to make more sequels Carpenter NEVER intended for his original to have a sequel. If Zombie had used Carpenter's idea in a different way then he could've made something really special and a perfect remake, instead his remake deserves only 3 stars because of the first half of the movie, the last part of the movie is loud annoying and utterly unnecessary.",1305072000,,5124,4.515608180839613
2944324,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie seriously brings the horror movie experience to the next level. While combining the inherant creepiness that is Michael Myers with a pretty plausible backstory that at points borders on touching or at least an insight into the monster, this film hits all the right now. While it allows itself to fall prey to the formula that other horror movies fall into; teens have sex, breasts get shown, teen dies-these are necessary evils for Rob Zombie when releasing a horror film especially one as iconic as Halloween who knows he must pay homage to thsoe that came before. Not only does he do this, but he does it with style, giving depth to characters that on the whole, no one has significant screen time. One of the large failures I see in horror films, is their inability to humanize the victims of the monsters that destroy them. Not so in this movie, instead the viewer gets to look into the eyes of the victims along with Michael Myers and the sheer terror reflected there reveals a film that must have been toughly directed because Rob Zombie somehow has his actors and actresses show real terror. Don't listen to anybody's opinion, even this reviews, when going into watching this film, just do so with an open mind and go from there.",1301356800,2,1247,4.647058823529412

2944329,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a classic horror remake & it's creepiness is reminiscent of the way horror movies were done in the past. Malcolm McDowell is exquisite as Dr Samuel Loomis, exhibiting a perfect understanding of Michael Myers from a psychological perspective & his insistence to stop his evil rampage is well worth seeing. Tyler Mane is also good in his monstrous killer instict as Michael Myers. Sheri Moon Zombie & Scout Taylor Compton are also good in their portrayals of Deborah Myers & Lauri Strode characters. The only blunder that director Rob Zombie committed was to give an uncessesary complete background of Michael Myers, thus dilluting the Myer's mystery that we've been accustomed to. And this, unfortunaley, put some bit of a dent in the movie's excellence.

But I like it very much because it's much more better than the latest horror remakes like My Bloody Valentine, Nightmare On Elm Street & a bunch of modern horror jokes (Forget Me Not for instance) to be hypothetically speaking.

I think Rob Zombie's re-writing and direction was very well done, the performances were phenomenal, and overall the flick is a very effective study of psychosis and the tragedy of poverty, apathy, and mental illness in our society.

But to have the title of ""Halloween""...

This ""re-imagining"" was obviously done with a love of the original, and again I hasten to say I didn't DISlike it, but it just does not come close to the magic found in Carpenter's masterpiece.  Too many other reviewers here have pointed out what is MY primary issue with it...the humanization of Michael Myers robs him of the menacing fear that he carried in the original film.

That fear is inevitably replaced with a kind of grudging sympathy.  Regardless of his brutality or the fact that he's now about nine feet tall and weighs about a thousand pounds, we can't help but feel sorry for the poor child we get to know and share heartache with in the first half-hour or so of the film.  Those of us who have seen it, admit it; are there any of us out here that didn't think his first two killings were justified?  Did we not, albeit in a fantastic sense of horror-film viewing, feel that those first two victims got what they deserved?

After that, it was easy to swallow his fall into psychosis and at least partially not hold him to blame for what he did.

The cinematography and acting is superb; Scout Taylor-Compton is excellent in her starring role, Malcolm McDowall was an inspired choice to take up the mantle of Dr. Loomis, and Tyler Mane is an intimidating screen presence, with or without the signature Mask.  Add in Danny Trejo in a wonderfully sympathetic performance (which only adds to the sadness we ultimately feel for Michael, although it seems to try to make us hate him), William Forsythe in a grimy and easily hated part, and the wonderful Dee Wallace in a small but convincing role, and you have all that is needed for a great horror film...

...and we get a very good one, but not if you were like I was, and hoping (perhaps naively so) for the same level of horror and fear we got in 1978.

Well worth the watch; you won't feel you've wasted your time on it, but don't be expecting the hair on the back of your neck to be doing the two-step as you sit in dread for the grim, masked spectre of Myers...instead, expect to feel disgusted with the illustrated failings of family, society, and the mental-health system.

As a horror buff, I can't understand the seemingly widespread attraction to depictions of senseless gore (e.g., the truck stop bathroom scene, the introductory throat slicing scene of the stepfather). The power of horror to scare lies in forces unseen or psychological demons, not marauding oafs following their victims in plain view. Such obvious sensationalist tripe as Zombie's directorial efforts should only impress those with IQs of 80.

2944341,3,B000VKL6Z2,"What a travesty! Not so much that Halloween has been remade, but that Zombie's take on Michael Myers begins so well only to end up being a turd. I resisted seeing this upon release, but finally gave in when it available to me for free. The idea of one of my favorite films of all time being messed with just didn't sit right with me.

I must admit that for the first 50 minutes I was genuinely captivated. Originally I was appalled by the prospect of fleshing out Michael Myer's childhood. What made it work was that this was clearly Zombie's vision. I could accept it because I didn't feel that this had anything to do with Carpenter's Michael Myers. It felt more like Zombie's fantasy of what Michael Myers childhood had been like in a white trash family and how it led to his murderous spree. Of course the scariest thing about the original Myers is that there is no apparent reason for his evil. He's a blank slate which all sorts of fears can be projected on. For Zombie that projection is having a stripper mom who has a boyfriend who threatens to ""skull f*&k"" her. This all works because it is clearly Zombie's universe.

The film goes down hill and I mean tumbling down when Zombie enters Carpenter's territory. The film becomes all to familiar in that its plot begins to mirror Carpenter's original. By no means is Zombie able to pay homage or even copy Carpenter in a compelling manner. What has to be the worst aspect of this is the actresses who play the three teenage girls. All of them are horrible, and what's most unforgivable is how awful the girl is who play Laurie Strode. This is the character who was played by Jamie Lee Curtis, who gave an iconic performance in the original. All this girl does is shriek and talk like some valley girl. Imagine this line, ""so like was that the boogie man"". Now I'm not sure if these were her exact words, but that's what her character is like. The biggest abomination of this fiasco is that it's not even scary. The set pieces just make you wish you were watching the original. Zombie only comes close only once to an effectively scary scene when Laurie is trapped in a drained pool. She can't get out and Myers is in hot pursuit. What kills this creative sequence is that you really could care less if the girl lives or dies. More will actually probably wish her to die.

Usually you just have to accept that there's a crazy guy running around butchering people.  Here, we see a disturbed child with sadistic tendencies twisted by life in an institution into psychopathic madness.

I cannot think of any remake that misses the point so completely as Rob Zombie does here. The power of the original Halloween film lies in several factors:

1) The sheer blankness of the killer, about whom we literally know almost nothing from the start of the film to it's end. His motives, his inner life, his personality, remain ominously hidden.

2) The dread that builds up from hinting at horrors to come, which is helped on by us barely glimpsing the killer until he begins his rampage towards the end of the film.

3) Most importantly - John Carpenter's masterfully eerie direction, which lends a deeply unsettling air even to a shot of an empty surburban street.

So what does Rob Zombie do? He completely strips away all the mystery and dread right from the very first scene, by tirelessly trying to fill in the blanks in Michael Myers' life! We don't want them filled in, for heaven's sake, that's the whole point!

It pains me to say this (because this was obviously a labour of love) but RZ really couldn't have missed the point any more if he'd tried.

Having said all that, this film is still better than any of the sequels (with the possible exception of Halloween H2O). It's certainly better than a lot of slasher films on the market, although at over 2 hours it is far too long to be truly effective even on that score.

I really wouldn't want kids watching this. I thought the R-rated stuff had to wait until 1am to air. For example, the 'smashing the bully's head in' scene early in the movie. Also, in that scene, after the pause when you think Michael may let the kid live, I would have just went to Michael bringing the club/stick/shovel for a final blow then fade to black. But what do I know. I also actually wondered, when young Michael finally shuts down in the mental hospital, how many other kids would do the same thing under the same circumstances. I'm only referring to the shutting down part. Not the killing. I agree with the others about Mike's size. Unnecessary, although I was stunned when I saw him stand up. I really thought he would let the Janitor live. Now the 2nd half, after Mike escapes, pretty much blows. The entire movie is fairly predictable, but the lousy 2nd half was just too 'campy'?

This movie was awesome I loved this movie Rob Zombie knows how to make a great solid film. I saw the theatrical and I own the unrated collector's edition on Blu ray. But let me say that the unrated was much more better of a movie, the only differance between is that Rob took out spacific part and replaced them with new scenes. Like the escape scene where Michael kills all the security gaurds and gets out that is changed to a new escape scene. The story it's pretty cool, in the beginning of the story there's a how story behind the reason Micheal does what he does, like what he did when he was a kid. The kid that plays Michael as a kid did an amazing job in this film.

The cast is great there's Tyler Mane as Michael Myers, Scout-Tayler Compton as Laurie Strode, Brad Douref as Sherrif Bracket, Deag Fearch as young Michael Myers, Sheri Moon Zombie as Micheal Myers mother, Daniell Harris as Anne, Hannah Hall as Michael's sister, and a bunch of other great actors.

This remake is different from the original and Zombie's remake of Halloween came as a total surprise to me; I didn't expect to like it at all and thought that he was going to ruin a classic of horror films. It goes deeper into the original Halloween story which I thought was fascinating and well done, it explains things and gives the movie more depth. I liked how the movie started with Michael Myers as a child and the flashback sequences which explained what just happened as Myers killed members of his family. You see an interview with Myers as a child and the setting is very interesting it tries to explain what happened. Then the movie progresses to the point where he is older and escapes from prison and murders people. There is more gore and everything seems more brutal than in the original which was to be expected and makes it more according to today's standards in horror movies. Some things are different and entertaining and are not an exact copy of the original scene by scene which I thought was well done and creative of Rob Zombie. It's like he took the movie and added things to it and made it his own.

Most remakes tend to be pretty bad (even if there are some great ones) and contrary to what many fans thought of Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween I actually enjoyed it and found it was a decent remake. Make no mistake this remake is not as good as the original one and it will never be I just think it was good and that it gave the movie an interesting twist to it.

The only highlights were the appearances of Ken Foree (from the superior original version of ""Dawn Of The Dead"") and Micky Dolenz (of the 1960's band and TV show ""The Monkees""). Other than that, ho hum. It's also too long.

Note to Hollywood: please stop with the remakes. Get some creative people in there and give us something new and fresh.

2944352,5,B000VKL6Z2,"If you're autistic, like I am, you'll probably want to thrill to this documentary which explores the link between autism and mass violence.  You see, Michael Meyers, like most autistics, finds himself lost in a world he never made.  A world populated by frighteningly vulgar and loud neurotypicals who encroach relentlessly, victimizing him until he lashes out with great and fiery vengeance, laying waste to the sordid humanoids around him in a blistering blaze of white heat.  The sister's boyfriend who got put down with an alunimum bat was particularly deserving of this fate, by the way.  Just before getting his head beaten in, you see him fashioning a sandwich from noisesome cold cuts.  He's the type of person who has absolutely no personality whatsoever, apart from a basic sloppiness of demeanor and a shaggy mane of hair that is in the process of fusing into white dreads.  Such a pity his early demise.  The world has lost so very much.

Michael then is unjustly incarcerated just for being a freedom fighter.  His mother can't take how great he is, and so she blows her brainz out.  Whatta shame.  So then Michael lays waste to some worthless hillbillies and busts right out of the mental hooskow, leading the resident psychiatrist and stereotypical liberal to bleat ""ooohh... oooh!""

Flash forward to later that night.  More people need Michael to give them a proper seeing to, which he does, very autistically.  You see, the man behind the mask is the perfect metaphor for autism.  The sense of disconnect and alienation, the sense of needing shelter... add in the fact that the original Meyers mask was adapted from a rubber mask of Captain Kirk (William Shatner interpretation) and we've come full circle.  Stick a knife in this one.  It's well done.  Rob Zombie learned from his mistakes in his first two movies and turned out an excellent movie.",1261958400,3,1865,4.866666666666666

2944357,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I rented Rob Zombie's Halloween sort of not really knowing if it was going to completely suck or if he hit one out of the park? Well, after seeing it...I have to tell ya, Rob didn't hit a home run but his new vision and re-telling of Carpenter's ""classic"" Halloween is a solid hit. He stuck to the basic story and plot (rearranged some things) and completely re-vamped Halloween into something much better (he got rid of allot of the hokeyness that was in the original). While not perfect (I had an issue with the ""time line"") I can look past that one discrepancy, it played out much smoother and with less down time.

Zombie's version of Halloween is far more violent and shows much more graphic detail. I liked the back story that gave you a better glimpse to how Michael Meyers came to be and the meaning behind ""the mask"". Halloween purists will argue that Zombie revealed too much by giving too much away and spending too much time on other details. Those are the minute minority that are just hung up on Carpenter's classic and are unwilling to accept a new version of the film.

You can't compare the two films. While similar in character and plot, they are completely two different animals. Carpenter's Halloween will always be the ""cult classic"" and what Zombie was attempting to do (and executed well) was make it ""his film"". Doing a complete carbon copy of the original would have been pointless and an insult to the original. I'm glad that Zombie manned up and took the reins on this one giving it quite a different look and feel. Dirty, gritty, cruel and ferocious to the end. Zombie's vision of Halloween will keep your attention from start to finish. I liked it so much that I broke down and bought the DVD, it is well worth watching and owning and great film for a Halloween night tradition.",1257984000,2,1807,4.539877300613497
2944358,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Remakes often fail, especially when based on classic material, as they are constantly compared to the original. It may be unfair, but it is inevitable.  So, with the remake of a movie as good and as well known as Halloween, Rob Zombie was stepping into some very big shoes.  What was interesting to me, is how the portions of the movie that had nothing to do with the original were far more interesting to me than those which were a remake.  While nothing necessarily unique, watching Mike Myers as a young boy, with all sorts of problems, mental and social, was rather interesting.  In some ways, leaving this movie as a prequel rather than a prequel/remake would have been advised.  Once the movie decided to become a remake I largely lost interest, knowing who was going to die, and constantly feeling that it had been done before dragged the movie down a notch.  When Laurie finally asks ""Was that the boogie man?"" I cringed, as it felt so out of place, and a forced nod to the original.

It's a shame really that the remake portion detracted from the what could have otherwise been something interesting.  I think Rob Zombie had shown some real darkness and great film making in the dark and sadistic devil's rejects, and was hoping for more from this.  While I got some interesting moments, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Maybe his sequel will cure the defects of the remake, and stick to being its own entity.  Its worth seeing, if you're not expecting too much.",1256256000,,1480,4.547169811320755
2944359,3,B000VKL6Z2,"After reading the dead-on ""Needless Look Behind The Curtain"" review (good job Miles!), I just wanted to add that Zombie not only missed the point but took too many cheap liberties.  There are alot of swearing just for the sake of swearing moments that leave me underwhelmed.  Usually when theres a lack of any real substance in a movie (typically in horror or ""gangsta"") foul language can be used as ""padding"", kind of like puddy to fill the cracks in an otherwise spotty stretch of dialogue.  Many of Michael's murder sequences are very dark and confusing and continue for lengthy periods.  While I like this effect when used in restraint (a key concept lacking in Zombie's movies), it is actually distracting to the point of leaving these dramatic moments ineffectual.  Nothing is ever dramatic in a Zombie film because the man has no RESTRAINT.  Like ""Full Metal Jacket"", this movie has 2 parts: childhood/incarceration; adulthood/escape.  This first part is wonderfully done but relies too much on schlocky sex angles and that language.  I do like the retro 70's vibe of the first part and I can go with the Michael Myers childhood storyline if need be.  Michael's new history seemed plausible and made Michael more human.  Like Miles said in his review, this human element ruins the 2nd part where he takes on those immortal qualities we've all grown up with.  Another complaint about the darkness of many scenes is I can't tell if Laurie shoots Michael in the head at the end or what.  Why was she able to recover from the balcony fall with Michael faster than him?  HUH??  There are a few grey areas in this movie to say the least.

Zombie, nontheless, comes up with a stellar cast (Malcolm MacDowell, Mickey Dolenz, and even Richard Lynch ""Seven-Ups"") and their bright performances all but save this movie.  Halloween fans may be divided and some I'm sure will like this movie.  As far as I'm concerned, Dr. Loomis has nothing to apologize to Michael over!",1255737600,,1964,4.7804154302670625
2944360,2,B000VKL6Z2,"My first reaction to Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN was: ""Why?"" The film is near-perfect as it is, and didn't need to be remade or, as the idiotic studio-suit buzzword goes, ""re-imagined."" But what the hell. Since Hollywood isn't interested in new ideas, and Zombie has apparently run out of such ideas as he has, I guess it was inevitable. This leads me to my second reaction, post-watching-the-film, which is, ""Is Rob Zombie a f-ing idiot or what? Doesn't he get why this was a good movie in the first place?""

I don't say this to be abusive. I do believe Zombie has some talent and aesthetic style. The problem is that his style - at least as it pertains to HALLOWEEN -- is the wrong one. You don't use a sledgehammer to do a flyswatter's job, and you don't let a sadistic, gore-infatuated fanboy direct a horror masterpiece. The original HALLOWEEN was great for a lot of reasons, but chief among them, it didn't overanalyze its villain. And this is the real point that needs to be made here, because what Zombie does to his HALLOWEEN is part of an much wider and sillier trend in modern horror - the need to provide a reason why its killers do what they do.

If I had to sum up the original, John Carpenter-directed version of the film in one phrase, it would be this: ""Yes, Virginia, there really is a Boogeyman."" That's basically it. The motivations of the film's masked, mouth-breathing murderer, Michael Myers, are never explained to any meaningful degree, because - gasp! - they don't have a rational explanation. Michael doesn't get an ""origin story""; no insight is provided as to why he murdered his sister Judith as a young boy, or why he's re-enacting the crime on a much larger scale as an adult. He's killing Because. Just BECAUSE. That's as much why as you get. It's almost Biblical. (""Who are you?"" Moses asks the burning bush. ""Who I AM."" God replies. ""I Am Who I AM."") As Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) explains to the Sheriff, Michael is not so much a human being as an embodiment of Evil itself, a Bad Thing that Happens to Good People. He's the Book of Job in a William Shatner mask. (That's why, incidentally, he's credited at the end of the film not as Michael Myers, but as ""The Shape"": he's taken the shape of your fears, whatever they might be.) But HALLOWEEN is not less scary for this lack of information. Quite the contrary. It's scarier precisely because we don't get the satisfaction. There is no ""Why?"" where Michael is concerned. He just Is.

Zombie isn't satisfied with that answer, and so he's approached the film from a different angle - the angle of the ""origin story."" Here, Michael's origin is that as a child, he was abused, neglected, picked-on, and basically f'd from birth. As a result, he developed into an unspeaking, sadistic, remorseless killer. Very neat. Very plausible. And completely missing the point. Because by reducing Michael to a set of influences, mere cause and effect, he's also taking away nearly all his power as a villain. There's a reason we don't look behind the curtain in Oz; we might discover the Wizard is a sweaty dwarf on a treadmill. That's not cool. That's boring. And so is this film. Because not only does Zombie ruin the best aspect of HALLOWEEN - the almost-supernatural Boogeyman angle - he also viciously stomps the other aspect that made the original special -  its sense of restraint. Carpenter had enough sense to understand that what is left out of a movie is often just as important as what is left in. Instead of a few perfectly set-up and executed murders, we get a gigantic massacre that quickly numbs. Instead of a few drops of blood, we get buckets of steaming gore (always the first refuge of the hack who can't actually scare his audience). Instead of long cat-and-mouse games with totally unsuspecting victims that rack up the tension to an unbearable degree, climaxing in sudden death, we get drawn-out bludgeonings, followed by nonfatal stabbings, followed by near-escapes, followed by more bludgeonings and finally, fatal stabbings. Zombie's complete lack of subtlety, his refusal to leave anything to the imagination, isn't just bad film-making in and of itself; it's completely unsuited to the telling of this particular tale. Using him to do a HALLOWEEN remake is like using a rusty chainsaw to perform eye surgery.

I suppose you could make an argument that since this is a remake (excuse me, a ""re-imagining""), Zombie was entitled, even obligated, to go in a different direction than Carpenter, one which has Dr. Loomis actually apologizing to Michael for ""failing"" him instead of blasting him with a .38, 'cause tha's what you do with Pure Evil when you find it. But even here the film falls down, because if Michael is a pure sociopath, as Malcom McDowell's version of Loomis maintains, Loomis has little to apologize for. See, while the jury's still out about whether a psychopath/sociopath can be actually be ""made"" in childhood (as opposed to simply ""born wrong"") there is universal agreement that neither sociopathy nor psychopathy are actually curable. How can a doctor fail the incurable? And this brings us back to the whole idea that made Carpenter's flick scary: that pure Evil is something outside of human influence, happening on its own terms for its own reasons and not subject to psychological analysis or treatment. (Donald Pleasance's Loomis ultimately got that Michael couldn't be ""reached"" - except by bullets.) Put simply, the genius of the original HALLOWEEN is that it ducked all the moral-psychological elements Zombie embraces and concentrated on one simple idea, best summed up by the last two lines of dialogue in the film:

LAURIE STRODE: (sobbing) Was that the Boogeyman?
DR. LOOMIS: As a matter of fact...it was.",1255651200,21,5744,4.802831142568251

One thing I do complain about is that Rob has to put his damn wife in every movie he does. Don't get me wrong I like her and she is very attractive, but sometimes you just have to get someone else.

And to me that's a good thing; Zombie attempts to re-invent the Michael Myers character in his version versus basically doing over what was already done masterfully with the original.

So what I suggest that you do is go into this movie with the above understanding. Because if you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptation will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was quite entertained by Zombie's Halloween. After all, a simple re-do that adds nothing new to what was already solidly in place would be pointless, right?

Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.

The first half of the movie is devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie starts by showing Myers' at age 10 or 11. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The movie flash forwards 15 years through Myers incarceration and ultimate escape to wreak havoc on the infamous town of Haddonfield just like in the original.

The first half of the movie is very well done to the point I was saying to myself that ""this is a great movie."" But then in the second half it collapses a bit with too many clich&eacute; horror movie ""oh that would never really happen"" moments. You know, like the police don't believe there's any danger and they're stupid; people venturing into places that you know they'd never go...especially on the heels of the warning that Myers could be in town; and the whole point of the first half of the movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.

But, like I said, I was entertained. The cast is pretty good, and the kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. This re-make is definitely worth a watch for horror fans, but devoted fans of the original might want to take a pass.",1253750400,,2545,4.923076923076923

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake does this. The My Bloody Valentine remake does this. The Friday the 13th remake does this. But Rob Zombie didn't do that, regardless of all of the things he has done.
  Comparing this to the original is like comparing Frank Oz's Little Shop of Horrors to Corman' s. Of course Frank Oz's is different. It's a musical. It stars Rick Moranis, It was made twenty years later for another audience and it burlesques the silliness of the original. Complaining that this ruins Halloween or lacks the atmosphere of the original is completely missing the point. Zombie has taken a movie with strong Giallo influence and infused it with splatpunk. It is not a thriller, it is a gritty, brutal slasher film that is not meant to have socially redeeming qualities but rather to bring Myers into the 21st century. It doesn't completely succeed at this. Zombie deserves some praise for deciding to make Michael Myers more than The Shape, but he does it in sort of a derivative fashion and he doesn't put Myers into our world but rather his. This is its own movie. Its own mediocre movie.",1253491200,,1254,4.7214611872146115

I don't remember if it showed it in the original, but I liked how it shows some of his childhood, made me understand what he went through and everything a little more. Also I personally liked how the mask looked aged once he grew up, I know some people didn't like it, but it made it more realistic since that's what would of happened to it, it wouldn't of stayed brand new looking after all those years.",1253491200,,594,4.085470085470085

I took her advice and I just saw it today and my jaw dropped to the floor so many times and all of my doubts were proved wrong!!

2944373,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Halloween (Rob Zombie, 2007)

Despite my contempt for the current Hollywood remake craze, I somehow can't stop myself from watching them despite knowing that almost every remake will find some way to mess itself up, even when it tries to be slavishly faithful (think Gus van Sant's shot-by-shot Psycho remake here). It's very rare that a remake gets it even half-right, and when someone does a remake and attempts to add something, that way lies madness. Except when it works. I know I'm probably in the minority in thinking so--after all, the whole reason Michael Myers is scary in John Carpenter's classic Halloween is that we have absolutely no idea how he got that way, save for one scene at the beginning of the movie that tells us he's already messed up by the time he's ten years old--but I think Rob Zombie giving us Michael Myers' backstory in his Halloween remake actually works.

In case you've been underwater for the last thirty years, the plot: a youngster named Michael Myers (played as a youth by Hancock's Daeg Faerch, as an adult by X-Men's Tyler Mane), sick of his abusive family, snaps and offs his stepfather and older sister. When his mother (played by Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon) gets home from her shift at the strip club, Myers is sitting outside the house holding his baby sister. Following this bit, we get half an hour of Myers growing up in the institution, being counselled by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, about as perfect a replacement for Donald Pleasance as possible). Myers, of course, breaks ourt and heads back to Haddonfield, spending the rest of the film terrorizing Laurie Strode (Wicked Little Things' Scout Taylor-Compton) and her pals.

Why does the backstory bit work here? Because Rob Zombie actually thought about it. From the looks of things, he spent years thinking about it. I grant you, it's pretty basic slasher-movie psychology these days--you have to try and make the killer sympathetic by showing that he was abused as a kid or whatever--but the kicker is that Zombie never once attempts to make Michael Myers in any way sympathetic. (You get the feeling for a while he's going to, but he resists the temptation.) It's a subtle subversion of that same slasher-movie psychology Zombie is borrowing wholesale, and it works. In fact, it's kind of brilliant, if you turn your head and squint the right way. Unfortunately, the film falls apart after that, becoming as generic a slasher movie as has come down the pike in some time, but the promise of the first half tells me Rob Zombie may actually be putting it together as a filmmaker. Much better than I expected. ***",1251331200,,2618,4.800443458980045
2944374,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Being a huge fan of the original Halloween and not exactly ""liking"" Rob Zombie, but respecting that he is attempting to be somewhat creative, I decided to give this movie a try.  There were so many things wrong with it I can't even decide where to start.  May as well go with the cast: The ""new Laurie"" was so annoying to watch my sister and I instantly elbowed each other when we saw this in the theater.  The teenagers in the original Halloween were what teenagers are supposed to be: not 'tweens that screech and twist their faces and bob their heads with every line of dialogue.  Also, her screaming was enough to make me crazy by the end of the movie.  I'll move on to the young Michael Myers:  he looked like an overweight and not so cute Dakota Fanning.  His acting was also so bad that it was distracting.  The bedhead hair in the eyes got old after about 2 minutes.  Not scary, just annoying. The only saving grace in the cast was Tyler Mane - very scary and tall.  And almost mysterious....  Almost.
Next, I'll address the whole premise of this ""remake"":  Why is it that Rob Zombie has to white trash everything up?  I totally agree with other reviewers that the whole POINT and the whole thing about Michael that is SCARY is that we have no idea what made him lose it.  Mystery is something that escapes Rob Zombie and that he will never be able to duplicate from the original Halloween.  Stick with the Saw over-the-top-gore-screaming-violence Rob, because true fear and mystery is not something you are skilled in presenting on screen.",1251244800,37,1548,4.517985611510792

2944376,5,B000VKL6Z2,"In honor of writing my demonic-numbered review, I thought I'd pick one of my favorites! I love Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (NOT the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans!

HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psychopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time? I highly recommend HALLOWEEN!!!!!!",1250208000,,2210,4.740259740259741
2944377,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I am a huge fan of the original Halloween, so took a chance on this one.  Although I always thought that the original film left gaps in the story...why was Michael the way he was?...yes, Rob answered this for us folks, but how difficult it was to watch this poor boy living in this over the top dysfunctional home! It makes sense to the story, but I found it too disturbing to watch. He was a much more believable Michael, we understood where he was coming from, his pain was too huge for a young child to handle...but did I really want to know these details and suffer along with this young boy?  Heck, no! To top it all off, Zombie movies (which I should have known!) are far too grotesque and bloody for my taste.  The original movie had just the right amount of gore, suspense, scary music and fear.  I didn't need to be taken to the next level of horror, so I shut the movie off.  I never finished it because what I had seen was more than enough.  I wondered, afterward, about our society and what makes us love these type of movies.  If these horrific events happened to anyone we knew, we wouldn't be so anxious to watch them on the big screen. The fact is that the world is hard enough, scary enough, dark enough...we hardly need to be on a journey of insanity for two hours and then watch the bonus features so we can see more about how they made the gore fest come to life! This one is just over the top, and not enough of an improvement on the original to make it worth seeing.  Watch some quality horror, something that scares you, but doesn't make you want to be sick.",1250121600,12,1581,4.229235880398671
2944378,2,B000VKL6Z2,"A few aspects of the film are actually quite good. Tyler Mane is a great Michael Myers. He's almost seven feet tall and is built like a giant. He's a total monster and the destruction and mayhem he causes is believable given his size. The adult version of Michael Myers is spot-on for a re-imagining of the film. Malcolm McDowell also does a good job as Dr. Loomis. He's no Donald Pleasance, but McDowell's take on the character isn't bad. Scout Taylor-Compton is also a worthy mention. She slips into the shoes of a modern day Laurie Strode rather flawlessly. Moving on from the acting though, the film is pretty solid from the time Michael gets his iconic mask through the finale. The way Michael made so many masks while he was in Smith's Grove was an interesting idea and the scene where you see his room fifteen years later with nothing but masks on every wall is one of the best in the film. The cinematography is also something that is often overlooked, which is a shame since it's actually pretty exceptional. It seemed to stand out most during the scenes where Michael was stalking Laurie, especially in the abandoned Myers house at the end. There's a scene right after Michael gets out of Smith's Grove where he goes to a truck stop and winds up getting the jumpsuit we're all familiar with. While there, he runs into Big Joe Grizzly in the bathroom stall and is banging Grizzly's hand, which is holding a knife, against the bathroom stall wall. As he's doing this though, the bathroom stall is just getting demolished but with every smashing blow, the camera violently shakes. The camera just always seemed to have a knack for giving a good perspective of what the character was going through, whether it was Michael or Laurie.

The disappointing part of this is pretty much everything leading up to Michael getting his mask back after his escape is pretty terrible. The dialogue, especially in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film, is horrendous. Everything that's said between Deborah Myers and Ronnie White is just awful. The white trash upbringing just doesn't seem worthy for a horror icon like Michael Myers. It's just hard to believe that Michael Myers is the way he is because his mom was a stripper and his older sister was a whore. Logic seems to just be thrown by the way side as the film progresses. After Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, he returns to his old house where his mask and knife that he used to kill his family happen to just be lying under the floorboards. So did the police just pick up the bodies without searching the house or what? So he got his jumpsuit by stealing it from a guy taking a dump at a truck stop? Really? Hearing some of the original music return from John Carpenter's version of the film was a bit bittersweet. On one hand, it was great hearing it again. On the other, however, it just didn't seem to fit. Made me miss the original film more than anything. Giving Michael Myers a specific origin was probably Zombie's biggest mistake. The most terrifying thing about Michael Myers was that he was The Shape and had a bit of mystery to him. You knew he was going after Laurie, but other than that you had Loomis' word to fall back on. Michael was the human incarnation of pure evil. That's it. That's all you need. Humanizing the character and introducing us to his childhood only watered down the Michael Myers character.

There's a scene with Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis in Smith's Grove Sanitarium where Michael has made a mask that he's colored completely black. When Loomis asks him why it's black, Michael says that it's his favorite color. Loomis goes into an explanation about the color spectrum. Black is on one end and is the absence of color while white is at the opposite end and is every color. That's actually a great explanation of the differences between the original film and the remake. The original film would be the black segment of the spectrum. Carpenter's version leaves more to the viewer's imagination as the only explanation for Michael Myers is that he is ""pure evil."" While the remake would be the white segment of the spectrum as it goes into full detail why Michael Myers is the way he is and it shows every little violent and vulgar detail. Some people would say that having a little bit of mystery would be a good thing when it comes to a film like this while others like having everything laid out for them. It all depends on the viewer and which end of the spectrum they prefer. In my opinion though, that's the biggest mistake Rob Zombie made. There's no mystery left with the Michael Myers character. He's no longer The Shape, but is a psychopathic killer because he was raised by a white trash family, liked to torture animals, and whose sister didn't take him trick or treating.",1249862400,2,4784,4.587616822429907
2944379,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a hard movie to review.  For one thing, I don't want to compare it to the original Halloween, since the original is supposed to be a classic and therefore, untouchable.

Something was wrong with the pacing in this remade version though.

The movie started off SO good when it was dealing with the little kid going crazy and killing everyone in sight.  He was being picked on at school by a bully, a stepfather that treated him poorly, and a sister he didn't like.  The only person the little boy liked was his mother.

There was a disturbing aspect to the storyline in that watching the little boy kill people in graphic ways time and time again, you begin to realize for the boy there's no compassion for human life whatsoever.  A disturbing side of the horror genre when it deals with realistic and dangerous subjects such as that.

They even touched upon the subject of whether the little boy actually felt anything when he was doing the killing.  Apparently not.

This movie must have some kind of record for the most killings in a movie, haha.  Time and time again people would get slaughtered, smashed, stabbed, you name it, but the same unstoppable insane lunatic roaming the streets and suburbs.

The main problem with the movie was how it started off so darn good and gradually got worse and worse until eventually you knew what was going to happen at the very end.  To me this is inexcusable for a movie that should have kept a consistent momentum that it had for the first hour or so.  Seriously, the first hour of the movie was pure horror perfection.  It just failed to keep the same exciting pace for the last 40 minutes or so because the final segments of the film were so predictable.

The subject of the killer trying to find his sister had potential, but never delivered.  What was he planning to do with his baby sister once he found her?  Also, why did he kill that guy who was supposed to be his friend back at the psychiatric hospital?  The killer had no sympathy for someone that honestly cared about him for several years, you think he would have given the guy a break.

But the most important thing is that the movie turned into a rather ordinary slasher horror by the second half of the movie, failing to come through.  I'll be generous and give the movie 4 stars anyway because I really did enjoy the first half of the movie with all the creative and constant killing action.",1249084800,,2410,4.481651376146789

Now, Zombie takes one of the all-time classic horror milestones and ""re-imagines"" it?? WTF?? I figured this would truly be a catastrophic failure! I put off seeing it for a year. Well, I watched HALLOWEEN last night, and couldn't believe how wrong I was! Zombie has not simply rehashed the original, he has recast it in a more modern and psychologically satisfying way. John Carpenter's Michael Myers was perfect for his day (and for any day, really)- a silent, faceless, relentless killing machine, without any personal history. A murderous enigma. Zombie has given Michael motivation and purpose. He has fleshed-out his childhood, much like HANNIBAL RISING did for Lector. I look at Zombie's HALLOWEEN as a seperate and completely different movie from the original. In the same way that I love both the originals and the remakes of DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE HILLS HAVE EYES for example, I can watch and enjoy either HALLOWEEN. Tyler Mane is an awesome, imposing Michael. He seems like he's 9 ft tall! Giving him a back-story did not lessen his horrifying and utterly lethal character. If anything, it added depth to the overall story. Still, either Michael- oldschool or new -is the stuff of wonderful, grisly nightmares...  P.S.- the number of cameos in this movie is wild!

2944387,3,B000VKL6Z2,"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE 3-DISC UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT ONLY!

I'm a little late on this one.  I saw it with everyone else two years ago, and saw the unrated cut about a year ago.  I didn't loathe the film as much as the fanboy purists, but I also didn't love the film as much as the new fanboys who seem to like anything that was made within the last ten years.  To me this film is half original brilliance and half uninspired mediocrity.  Hence, the three star rating.  But the actual three disc set gets a five star rating, but I'll get to that in a minute.

First off, the unrated director's cut is miles ahead and better then the cut shown theatrically.  We get more character beats, especially with Dr. Loomis and Michael's break-out scene is  done more realistically.  Zombie spends so much time making Michael a real human being in this film that it always boggled my mind how he escaped like Superman in the theatrical cut.  The director's cut not only uses incidents torn from the past's headlines, it seems more in step with the new tone and mythology of Zombie's Michael Myers.  We also get more time spent in the asylum with young Michael.  It's really well written and directed stuff that helps further drive Zombie's main thesis regarding Michael home, and it's truly creepy and unsettling.  For horro movie nerds we get a couple more detailed horror icon cameos in the form of Courtney Gains(Children of the Corn) and Udo Kier(Andy Warhol's Dracula, Modern Vampires) and Clint Howard(c'mon, you know this guy!).  Though, we lose the theatrical cut's cameos by Devil's Rejects allumni, my persoal favorite being Bill Mosley('Dog will hunt!)

The problems with this remake vary.  Firstly, the opening breakfast scene is so over the top and silly that it's just annoying.  Obviously, Zombie had a loaded script and had to make a short cut in setting up this dysfunctional family, but it's not very believable or well done.  More importantly, Zombie takes some of the mythos and general mystery away from the Michael character by letting us get to know him and see that he was a regular kid with problems, major mental problems.  Unlike Carpenter's original where Michael was the personification of the unknown and faceless evil, Zombie just makes Michael your average American psycho.  It's interesting and unexpected but it is one of the factors that help in making the second half of the film not work.  I do appreciate the asylum scenes and I really like the relationship between young Michael and Loomis, played beautifully and tragically by Malcolm Mcdowell, leaving behind the kooky obsession of Donald Pleasance's Loomis.  The movie tries hard to make the viewer understand Michael and feel connected to him while being repulsed by what he is.  It's only half successful, and only in the first hour.

After about forty-five minutes the film switches into a total remake of the Carpenter film proper.  Unfortunately, the film is so top heavy that we never really get to know or care about Michael's future victims including Laurie Strode, and this is big gripe for me. Not being able to care about the characters or even differentiate them from one another is death to a horror film.  Many slasher films from the mid to late 80's made the same mistake and just became exorcises in gore special effects. Kudos to Zombie for holding back on the gore though.  Sure, this movie is way gorier then the original but it's not that gorey in general.  The violence is more implied with body twitches, murky lighting, sound effects and unsettling music stings by the great composer Tyler Bates.  So, all the folks who saw this film and claimed it to be more violent then it is, are just giving Zombie the ultimate compliment as a director.  Hitchcock achieved the same thing with his shower scene in Psycho, though this film is also more violent then that film for sure.  Different times and different strokes I guess.

While all the remake additions are interesting on their own right, the rushed and by the numbers remake section, the section with the real terror from the original, is slighted and less then desirable.  The finale is a great roller coaster ride, and I for one LOVE the final shot.  It was unexpected and leaves the audience unnerved for the future of the main character.  I don't think the film is a complete failure or terrible, but rather an underachiever with moments of originality and brilliance.  I would prefer Zombie to stick to original material then to remake ANYTHING.  I hold his Devil's Rejects in very high regard.  Maybe this summer's sequel Halloween 2, Zombie will perfect his original vision and not be shackled by following the original film's storyline.  Though, from the trailers I saw, Zombie's Halloween 2 seems to be set in a hospital.  NATCH.

The three disc set is AWESOME!  If you loved this remake it's a no-brainer, but the third disc is worth a look even if you didn't.  Hell, if you're an aspiring filmmaker at all the third 4-hour making of disc is a must see.  Zombie does, like Peter Jackson, his own bonus materials for his films and chronicles the whole production.  This doc really shows the filmmaking process in it's entirety like none other I've seen in a long while.  One really gets an inside look at how these things are done, and not the usual B.S. EPK material most DVDs come with that end up really being a commercial for the film that has the actors saying empty things like, ""Yeah, it was a really fun shoot.  Everyone's great.""  You really get to see what a director's ultimate role in a film is, from every level.  There's a great bit involving the location scouting that shows Zombie making the tiniest of alterations to a set.  An alteration the viewer wouldn't think twice about but is on the director's mind at all times.  The second disc is the same as the previous releases as is the commentary.  A really good commentary that doesn't repeat too much of the info found on either bonus disc.  Not to mention Zombie goes into detail regarding his decision for this remake as far as the visuals, the violence, color scheme, and performances--which are all good despite some of the underwriting on some of the characters.

Bottom line, this at least an interesting film, if not a great one.  I like it enough, while not being totally enamored of it.  I anticipate the sequel, and whether it's good or bad, I hope Zombie moves out of the remake business and gets back to making real films from his heart. Carpenter's Halloween is one of my favorite films of all time.  I hold it in high regard as far as horror cinema goes.  Carpenter himself is a filmmaker I use as a template for my own endeavors.  One thing that this remake tragically loses that the original had, and it was very important to the original, is that Michael was truly the boogeyman.  Some dialogue regarding the boogeyman, like the original, is peppered throughout the remake but it all seems moot considering how Zombie makes Michael so much more human.  He's not the boogeyman, he's a psycho with a motive only a psycho would understand or relate to.  The original Michael Myers was truly faceless and without motive, which made him scarier in his randomness, well until the original Halloween sequels screwed all that up.  This remake is no worse then the sequels, which were all mediocre in my opinion. Here's hoping for the future.",1242864000,3,7384,4.706157443491816
2944388,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This film is one of the few remakes that I like, and what Rob Zombie has done is made one hell of remake that has some brutal moments and has made Michael Myers more nasty then has ever been before.

The film kicks off trying to explain the events that led to Myers to kill and the results are not nice fast forward 15 years later and Michael Myers has escaped the nuthouse and heading back the Haddonfield and Dr Lomis has to try and find him and somehow stop him.

Rob Zombie's remake has had good and bad reviews but I did like this film, ok we all know this will never top the 1978 Film but this one stands well on it's own, what Halloween fans will notice on this one, is that this one has a lot of gore which the others rarely had and Michael Myers is more sadistic and brutal then he has ever been

The film has some good scare moments that will movie goers on edge.

2944389,1,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie was such a disgrace that I don't think I could write a review without it being so long it would take me an hour to type it all. Rob Zombie thinks he has the right idea, but he can't see past his ego and turn Halloween into something he believes it should be. Blood, gore and all of the other cliche slasher movie formula's. It is almost as if he does not know how to build suspense and atmosphere that can make a horror movie that much more creepy and frightening to watch.

The only part that I enjoyed was seeing Danielle Harris come back to the franchise as the character Annie Brackett, and topless as well!

So from now on, I will be avoiding anything from Rob Zombie in the future, he is a true letdown from such a horror movie buff.",1241568000,5,750,4.165517241379311

The film was new enough to be intriguing, pulling you into original story elements that were latter meshed with my familiarity of the classic. I had heard of the ""white trash"" origin that was given to Michael in this film, and I had thought I was going to despise that element.  However, it ground Michael into a reality, a harsh, gritty, completely possible reality, that made the film even more creepy.

2944391,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been wanting to slam this movie for some time and now that I have nothing better to do with my time here goes,
I respect Rob Zombie as a musician I love his work when he was with White Zombie, to this day it's one of my favorite bands. To me it seems you should stick with what you are good at if you were blessed with a talent of some sorts you should by all means try to hold on to that talent and make it grow. Rob Zombie is a great musician he should have known better than to dabble in other arts there was one instance where he was lucky however and that was the devils rejects for a fan of a good gory shoot em up movie that was good but, that was all just good. There was no need to remake this movie there was nothing wrong with the original. There was no reason to explain the killer and why he did what he did throughout the entire franchise it was already explained that he was pure evil. The original showed that Michael Myers grew up in a loving family that's what helped make the story good because nobody understood how a good family raised a killer child plain and simple. This movie ruined the credibility that the story once had. As a writer and a reviewer I must look at all sides of the movie and judge it fairly there were some parts I liked about it, the story actually made sense it seemed logical for Michael Myers to turn out a killer after his childhood was stolen from him, but there is a problem with that considering there has been a franchise of Halloween for a long time the classics never die until remakes like this come out it's about as bad as casting a rapper to be an actor (Halloween resurrection) I guess it's almost fair to say the franchise died when Busta Rhymes appeared in that movie the only good part was when he was stabbed, I am trailing off here so I guess I said what needed to be said about this movie, Rob stick with the music don't kill your career just yet.",1241136000,2,1919,4.1063829787234045
2944392,4,B000VKL6Z2,"As far as horror remakes go, I'm usually quick to write them as nothing more than just Hollywood's way of saying they have no other tricks up their sleeve & a remake is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Sadly, horror remakes rarely are as innovative nor as entertaining as the originals & most of them are financial flops at the box office. With the mere exception of perhaps a few, I could very well skip most of them altogether & not miss a beat honestly. In recent years, most of the remakes cater to the teeny bopper crowd & select few deserve our attention. Zombie's take on the Carpenter classic Halloween is one of the more tolerable exercises in futility for our times.

As anyone will tell you, the future of horror films may look somewhat more positive with the strange but powerful presence of Rob Zombie standing behind a camera. His determination & sincere dedication to making great scary flicks is hopeful to say the least as no one out there wants to really scare us anymore nor craft anything that will merit a solid R-rating. God forbid you make a film which is steeped in heavy violence & gore that may warrant a very cool but undesired NC-17 rating. (Now that's what I'm talking about.) Zombie, however, is very capable of straddling the hardcore horror world while keeping the mainstream masses in check. Kudos to Zombie for sure!!

Let me begin by saying I've never been a fan of the original Halloween series per se. For some unearthly reason, I simply cannot fathom the concept of a child who is simply evil &enjoys killing for the fun of it. A great many slasher films have been made throughout the years which are nothing particularly special but yet the villains' motivation for killing is often justified in some fashion. In Carpenter's original film, we never get a clear understanding of why Michael kills which makes Halloween a cop-out in my opinion & nothing more than a springboard to deliver some cheap thrills.

Zombie does get it right & I give him props for atleast giving us a solid hour of Myer's history before releasing the slasher bloodbath with a heavy body count. Malcolm McDowell gives a bang up performance as Dr. Loomis, who tries very hard through the years to work with young Myers with no success whatsover. Rob's take on the original clearly explains much of Myer's psychological motivation which spirals into an inevitable homicidal explosion. In fact, most of the viewers are more than likely to feel sorry for the little guy this time around whereas we never really felt any sympathy in the original film nor any of the horrendous sequels.

The second half of the film is nothing more than your average chills & thrills horror flick. Zombie has a keen eye for visuals & special effects, the remainder of his film is just your typical slasher fare which is decent but don't expect anything revolutionary here. While most of the movie isn't very scary, there are some cringe-worthy moments that will more than likely satisfy genre enthusiasts everywhere or fans of the original series. I just wish Zombie had found a better actress to take on the role of Laurie Strode. I'm sorry but she will never hold a candle to the incomparable Jamie Lee Curtis. That's just small potatoes I'm sure but Scout Talor-Comption is an annoying actress or maybe her part was poorly written. Perhaps a combination of both?

This is, quite possibly, one of the better horror remakes I've seen with the exception of Aja's Hills Have Eyes. I am curious to see what Zombie does this time around with H2.",1241136000,,3542,4.678972712680578
2944393,4,B000VKL6Z2,"If you are a horror fan you will like this movie. It has all the classic horror attributes. But it also bring in the new school horror elements as well. Rob zombie tells the story in a similar manner but with twist and a deeper dive into the heart of the characters. Even to the point of making Micheal seem human and we all know he is evil incarnate!
  Is this Oscar worthy? NO! But not every movie has to be perfect some times raw and imperfect works just as well! The story is told with heart but he had to stick to the story because it was a remake/retelling so he was confined into what was!
  The kills were there the story was there and the characters were there. It smoothly transitions from young Micheal to teen Michael to Adult killer! It stays true to the story so no worries for us HALLOWEEN fans it right up our alley!
  What people need to remember is that this is just a freshening to the series not the deathnail or rebirth of the franchise! It takes what we love the Halloween series and gives it a make over!

I already own the original and love it this is what horror movies should be like more scarier in zombies case he wanted it to be more bloody gory and trashy rather than make it scarier so it could beat the classic but nothing could be a classic but it could have been just as good this is so not worth the money nor time.,1239840000,7,494,4.0

This leads me to believe that even the director wasn't sure of the tale or that the producers weren't fond of his vision and forced re-shoots.  Sounds like a disaster in progress.

Where he humanizes a character that is scary because of how inhuman he is, it would have helped the film.  Michael is also poorly cast, he is way too huge.  It looks humorous.

Enjoyable revamp of the Halloween franchise that started with the 1978 slasher landmark from John Carpenter. Fans cried blasphemy when they heard this was gonna be remade but Rob Zombie who is a hardcore fan of the original and whom helmed the underrated ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and the brilliant ""Devil's Rejects"" went to save the franchise after it became a joke of itself no thanks to ""Halloween Resurrection"" with Busta Rhymes ruining the film. Although he had no intention to make a full remake like the horrible ""Psycho"" remake from 1998 he wanted to make a prequel and a reinvention of the original movie that honors John Carpenter's masterpiece. The film does co-star Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Brad Douriff, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Danielle Harris, Dee Wallace Stone, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, and Sybil Danning as this film does give an interesting extended history of Michael Myers and how he had a dysfunctional family. I know some fans of the original Halloween are kind of disgusted with the new Myers being a ""Married with Children"" kind of trashy family. There is some brutal gory violence making this the goriest Halloween movie since ""Halloween 2"" in 1981, though it does miss out on the original bloodless scares that made the original movie a classic this one goes for bloody action like some of the Halloween sequels. Though it is very entertaining but can never replace the original classic as that was not the intention that Rob Zombie did for he just wanted to re-establish the franchise.

2944405,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Director Rob Zombie shows us in his remake of the classic, Halloween, how to grab the money and run.

First of all, you don't want to create anything fresh or original--like the original ""Halloween, ""Alien,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" etc. You can always remake a third-rate Asian horror import because all the special effects you need are to slap white make-up on the faces of Asian kids, pile on black mascara and make them bulge their eyes and grit their teeth. Or, you can make the l5th or 20th sequel to a once brilliant original like ""Saw"". Or, you can just go back to the original classic--in this case ""Halloween""--and know that you'll be guaranteed tons of free buzz on the internet. The younger movie buffs who never saw the original will be guaranteed to fill up the seats for this much ballyhooed remake.

In this remake, Zombie has trashed everything that made the original so treasured by its fans. Instead of likeable, suburban characters, who wore attractive clothes and seemed to be fond of each other, he gives us a world of sleazy, repulsive jerks who engender no sympathy from the audience. Michael Myers, terrifying and mysterious, in the original, is now a towering, seven foot gorilla. In fact, the first hour of this travesty is spent studying the evolution of Myers from moon-faced idiot to his adult monsterhood. His step-father is a human monster, disguised as red-neck nutjob, his sister is a skanky, hard-faced idiot and his mother, a stripper, is so weak-minded in her love for her little monster, that you care nothing about their fates.

Just as bad is the casting of the youngsters. Jaime Lee Curtis was completely likable and sympathetic, as the sweet, naive young girl. Although her two girlfriends were more frisky, you still liked them, too. Also, they all wore attractive clothes. In the remake, the girls live in their boring jeans and tennis shoes and sweatshirts. They look no different from the other colorless clones you see at a mall. Show them a skirt or a dress and they'd probably scratch their heads and go, ""Duh, what's dat?""

There's a total lack of suspense as Michael Myers becomes the destroyer. You see him too much, for one thing, and his William Shatner white mask becomes boring. When he removes it, you see a good-looking young guy with stringy hair but with neatly manicured fingers. He trashes rooms and murders everyone in his path until finally, you're yawning and glancing at the clock and thinking: how much longer is going to continue. The original used a brilliant musical score, composed by the movie's director, John Carpenter. The music is an integral part to the original's greatness. It was used sparingly or brilliantly and greatly enhanced the sheer fear. In this remake, it's thrown in from the very beginning until you forget you're even listening to it.

The new Laurie spends the entire seond half of the movies shrieking non-stop, screaming and weeping and gibbering. If I was trying to escape from a killer, I think I'd be as quiet as possible and save my breath. In her boring jeans and tennis shoes and sweater and ugly glasses, she's as dull and forgettable as her mall buddies.

Equally irritating is the way the girls try to be playful and talk funny by swallowing their words and going nasal and gooching each other.  They're always trying to act scary by fluttering their fingers and disguising their voices to sound scary.

Although the original featured some nudity, Zombie wallows in it--female, that is, although you never see any male nudity. The girls are hard, snarling, tough and repellant. It's not the fault of the performers. They all try hard. It's the way they're directed that drains them of any likablity or audience identification. Even the first scene where we see Laurie and her parents over the breakfast table is ruined when Laurie makes a sexual joke using a finger and a bagel. Why? You want to slap her because she seems to think she's the cutest and sharpest girl in the world.

I remember those old, golden times in a theater where movie-makers would occasionally thrill us with brilliant, original fantasy and horror--with movies like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Thing,"" ""Alien,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" Now and then, we do get something original like ""Jeepers Creepers"".

But mostly, it's sequel after lousy sequel and worst of all, lousy remakes of golden classics. If you've never seen the original, ""Halloween,"" watch it and see why it'll be watched for decades to come--and disasters like its endless sequels and terrible remakes like this one will be relegated to the garbage dumps.",1230595200,24,4623,4.862770012706481
2944406,1,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, this film is so shallow, cliched, and tired I don't even know where to begin.  Zombie somehow manages to take a beloved classic (which was so good to begin with that it didn't ned to be remade in the first place) and destroy just about everything great about it.

Where to begin?  The dialogue is incredibly insipid, crass, and totally unbelievable.  The characters are thinner and more one-dimensional than a piece of white paper, and the motivations are absolutely straight out of a ""how to make a B-movie"" manual.  The Michael Myers backstory is so cliched that it's laughable; he comes from a seriously dysfunctional household with an abusive/alcoholic father, a stripper mother who is barely hanging on to life, and a cruel, whore sister.  Therefore, poor Michael becomes a serial killer!  Makes sense, right?  Not really...but, Zombie would like to fool people into thinking it does.

The three heroines from the original are back in the form of Anie, Linda, and of course, beloved Laurie.  Except these three girls are transformed from charming, wonderful, smart-alecky (in a cute way) girls into obnoxious, mean-spirited, vacuous, shallow twits who we can't even begin to care about.  Even Laurie herself fails to elicit much sympathy or empathy from the audience due to her being just plain stupid and rather, as I said before, obnoxious.

Loomis is transformed from a venerable, noble, and sympathetic Doctor into an egocentric, clueless, simpleton.  One can't feel any respect or identification with him either.

Finally, there's Michael himself.  In this incarnation, Michael turns from a child into a hulking behemoth...a 6 foot 8 inch bulking monster of a man.  Where's the suspense, horror, mystery, fright, or aura of terror in this idea?  I won't delve deeply into the ""what makes Michael work"" argument...but, making him 8' 9"" tall and built like a Hummer does NOT show basic comprehension for what made Michael such a legendary terror to begin with.  If bigger = scarier...why not just turn him into a 12' 8"" cyborg fashioned out of the remains of other serial killers and Nazi tanks?  Turning Myers into the Hulk doesn't make him scarier per se. In fact, it has the opposite effect because it's too obvious, lazy and cliched.  Everyone is expected to be scared of a HUGE man in a mask...but think of it this way. Real life serial killers Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy were ""normal"" guys. They appeared ""normal"" on the exterior and were also ""normal"" sized; but they were absolutely evil and some accounts also say they possessed inhuman strength. You wouldn't expect that from people who just look like they are the ""guy next door"". And THAT'S what makes them so scary. You would expect a 6'8"" hulking monster to be superhumanly strong...but you would absolutely NOT expect a man who stands just above 6 feet to be a completely indestructible force of nature. Sure, Zombie's version is more obvious...but that's also why it's so much less scary to some people. There's no mystery and no subtlety to Zombie's Myers, we expect exactly what we get. And therein lies the problem.  The original Myers had a quiet stealth and mystery to him that was truly disturbing; Nick Castle didn't simply walk while wearing the mask...he glided.  He moved smoothly and efficiently, like a shark.  And because of his ""normal"" stature, it made it even scarier when he performed superhuman feats of strength and stamina.

When I first saw the film, I wasn't sure whether or not to blame most of my dislikes on the actors...but then I realized, they were doing their best given the material they had to work with.  The fault lies with the director/writer for even putting such trash to paper in the first place.

Naturally, when this film was announced and the director revealed, audiences shouldn't have expected a shot-for-shot remake of the original.  But, audiences WERE expecting a film with intelligence, style, and a basic comprehension and respect for what made ""Halloween"" work in the first place. Zombie showed NONE of those things.  Instead he caters to the average IQ level of the reality-TV-slurping cro-magnons who have the attention span and aesthetic sensibility of a pre-schooler.  He took a great idea, a masterpiece of horror and dumbed it down...stripped it of it's mystery and subtlety, and thus its effectiveness...and layered it with white-trash characters, foul-mouthed and crass teens that are unlikeable, and poured buckets of blood on it; he made it more ""today"". That's NOT necessarily a good thing.",1229385600,39,4539,4.974834437086093
2944407,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Halloween (2007) Initially I was very disappointed to hear that the next movie from the Halloween franchise would be yet another ""reboot,"" or ""reimagining"" of the original movie rather than another sequel. I'm torn on this trend of remaking the classic horror films of my youth, initially finding most unnecessary. But at the same time, I came to realize that a set of British remakes of the Universal Studios Monsters movies of the 30's resulted in the Hammer Horror series nearly thirty years later, so there is some precedent of quality and worth. At the same time, I'm also one of the few people who will cut an eighth horror sequel some slack. Later I was a tiny bit less disappointed to hear that Rob Zombie had been chosen to write and direct the reboot as I have enjoyed his other movies to varying extents. Zombie's Halloween grounds Michael Myers in a horrible white trash upbringing, spending the first fifty minutes detailing why he descends into madness and murder. Part of that extra time is spent in Smith's Grove, giving more screen time to Dr. Loomis, now played by Malcolm McDowell. After that the story basically follows Carpenter's original with the almost feminine looking and tiny ten year old somehow growing to be 6'5'' Tyler Mane on institution food and becoming kind of a Terminator, bashing through walls to grab his victims instead of silently popping out at them from the dark. He pursues Laurie, Annie, and Linda through their worst October 31st ever, but also grabs several other victims every chance he gets, tripling the body count of the original Halloween. The supernatural dread Michael Myers originally had is muted by his grounded in reality origin all the way through the new movie's finale, a far cry from the sick fear you felt when Michael's body was no longer lying on the ground in front of the Wallace home. Weirdly, although I find this more realistic origin undermining to Michael Myer's ability to be fearsome, I find the movie's first 50 minutes more entertaining than the last hour, though the greasy long hair on everybody started to be annoying eventually. In fact, during the final chase between Michael and Laurie I grew bored, ready for the movie to just wrap it up. Overall, it is kinda fun to see how Zombie populates nearly every adult speaking part with a familiar genre face, but even that starts to grate when a lot of them are only on screen for a few seconds or don't even speak. As far as the negatives go, I dislike almost every bit of casting Zombie did on the younger cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis was so good as Laurie in 1978, and this new actress pales so far in comparison. Her Laurie is actually unlikable, and most of the time I couldn't even tell her and Linda apart even with the glasses shtick. The only bright spot among the younger cast is Danielle Harris as Annie. Harris, a vet of Halloweens 4 and 5 is a bright spot here and completely pulls off being a high schooler even though the actress was around 30 at the time of the production. I was a little sad to see her do a nude scene this far into her career though. McDowell is probably the best choice you could make to play Loomis, but it was a mistake for him to avoid watching the original, because he never takes the character as far out as Donald Pleasance did which is who Loomis is.

So, to put the final nail in this one, though there is a level of quality to this production and a few positive moments here and there, this remake is one of those unnecessary ones I mentioned.",1229212800,3,3629,4.584615384615384

2944409,5,B000VKL6Z2,"When you're doing a remake of a movie that was done right the first time, you have to differentiate it, take the same premise and go down some different paths than the first one took.  The 2007 Halloween remake does this, and it helps make it one of the best horror remakes ever done.

  The most obvious deviation from the original line of films is that Michael Myers now has an origin.  A large part of what made the original work was the very lack of a reason behind the character's malevolence: Michael was a perfectly normal little kid who, for no discernible reason, picks up a kitchen knife one October 31 and butchers his sister, beginning a years-long cycle as a mute, endlessly killing, boogeyman.  This time there's nothing normal about Michael to begin with.  He was born with psychotic tendencies and then grew up in an envirornment of abuse and torment; either of these factors - the nature or the nurture - could have resulted in a murderer, but coming together they create what Sam Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell in the role Donald Pleasance originally made famous) calls a 'perfect storm', that creates the monsterous killing machine Myers becomes.  It was a big risk to change the core of the character from an eerily blank slate to the more human monster we have in this version, but it worked great, and Myers (played by Tyler Mane as an adult and Daeg Faerch as a ten year-old) is menacing enough to leave just that little glimmer that Maybe there's even more at play behind that white mask than the aforementioned factors.

  The other big change is the time frame.  The 1978 original opens with Myers as a child but that takes up only a few minutes - 95% of the movie occurs on the Halloween day and night fifteen years later when Michael returns to his hometown of Haddonfield.  Here, the movie starts some time before the night Michael becomes a killer and continues through the years that follow, including his incarceration at a mental hospital and his eventual, devastating escape and return to Haddonfield.  We see the evolution of the monster in full, and by the time he's back home on Halloween night Myers is a tremendous, truly frightening force.

  Everything from the acting to the direction and the special effects, musical score, etc. is extremely high caliber and in addition to being scary and, at times, surprisingly moving, it's also one of the sexiest horror movies out there thanks to a cast of great looking actresses including Danielle Harris, Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Hanna Hall and Sheri Moon Zombie.  Also of interest on the acting front are appearances by Bill Mosely and Danny Trejo (both from director Rob Zombie's Firefly films - ""The House Of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky from the ""Child's Play"" movies).  Effective use of music and a number of hugely memorable visual images are also worth noting.

  The 2007 Halloween doesn't take the place of the original series, nor does it set out to; it extablishes itself as a great, Different take on the original concept and characters, and manages to match anything from the original series.  A horror essential.",1228176000,,3177,4.778388278388278
2944410,5,B000VKL6Z2,Ok I was not around when the original Halloween was released but watched it many many times over the course of my child hood and love it to this day. When Rob Zombie said he was remaking it I flipped becuase I am a huge fan of his since White Zombie and loved all his other movies. This movie not only did John Carpenters justice I think Zombie actually out did it. I try to see as many of the horror remakes I can because I am a big fan of Horror classics and the genre in general. Most of the remakes have been lame or over gorified. This one is by far the best remake I have ever seen and still managed to creep me out when I saw it in theaters. There are only a few remakes I would consider good but this one was Amazing. For any fan of horror movies in general this is a must have.,1227830400,,786,3.888198757763975

I must say i was greatly disappointed & lost almost all hope for an awesome movie when i heard tons of people from his other films inclueding his wife were in this film to i thought oh it's the same damn thing he's goin to ruin it. but i ended up goin on opening night out of being curious & loved it, his wife did a pretty good job to if you ask me. showed more acting skills than she did in the other 2 films i must say. although i still love the first i don't think you should compar them but more as look as them as a different veiw & i love rob's veiw of this film as well as the original",1227657600,,766,3.79375
2944412,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I have to say, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to films, especially horror films. I cannot say that I've ever sat through a film that literally made my head want to explode from severe pain. This is until I sat through Rob Zombie's Halloween.

I swear, I wanted to shut it off after the first ten minutes. What made me watch it all the way through.. I don't know. Chalk it up to too much curiosity, I guess. It was mind numbing! The dialog.. The acting.. The story.. I was shaking my head in disbelief. I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. Like some surreal nightmare. The worst pile of garbage ever to hit celluloid.

And this is coming from a big fan of Rob Zombie. I practically considered him my creative idol for a while. Man, what the hell was I thinking?! Mr. Zombie claimed he wanted to bring back Michael Myers to true form and make him terrifying again. He did the EXACT opposite. He made Michael into a JOKE! A walking, talking cliche. Laughable. Not scary or even remotely terrifying. Just one big joke!

And this all for a three picture deal. That was Zombie's only reason for remaking Halloween. To further his film making career, which should be laid to rest. I've lost so much respect for Rob, it's not even funny. As far as I'm concerned, he spit in John Carpenter's face with this failed attempt of a remake.

Bottom line.. You have to be completely brain dead to enjoy this movie. I'm sorry for be insulting but I can't for the life of me imagine how anyone could've possibly enjoyed this movie. It is utter trash. From beginning to end if you can make it that far without your brain completely shutting down.

Worst film ever made. PERIOD! Negative 5 stars.

2944413,4,B000VKL6Z2,If Rob could have made the beginning (the white trash segment) have a darker feel (or less of a white trash feel) like the rest of the movie...I would give it 5 stars.  I did love the violence and the blood though!,1226966400,2,214,4.095238095238095

2944415,3,B000VKL6Z2,"While I was watching Rob Zombie's new ""Halloween,"" I was truly amazed by two things: its length and violence. Having seen his films ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects,"" I knew what I was going to see in this revamped version, but I never expected he would spend so much time (more than 30 minutes) to show Michael Myers as a 10-year-old bullied boy (played by Daeg Faerch, who is certainly convincing).

I will not write here the details of his family; I only say it is not very pleasant to see, but maybe that is the point. Maybe Rob Zombie is just trying to give Michael a social background, something few people care. I am afraid it only deprives this horror icon of its superhuman presence. Tyler Mane did a very good job as grown-up Michael Myers, but the long introductory part that tried to (sort of) explain him has made the new ""Halloween"" just another serial killer movie.

And this film is very gory. It also has nudities (more than once). Not that I am complaining. Screaming Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is again chased by Michael Myers, and to his credit Rob Zombie has made each sequence competently, but that is all. What is shown here looks clichd, familiar to those who have seen other slasher films, except the unique cast including William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Richard Lynch, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig and Sybil Danning. Blink your eyes and you will miss Udo Kier and Clint Howard. (And ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz? Where was he?)

I have watched the original ""Halloween"" long time ago, but I still remember some of the film's scenes were really creepy. But they were not about Michael Myers as killing machine murdering his victims; they were about Michael Myers just standing in the street as if he is something supernatural coming from another world. From the strictly technical viewpoint, Rob Zombie's re-imagined version is decent. It is only that John Carpenter's vision is replaced by Zombie's relentless descriptions of violence, which was seen in his previous films. It was about time to move on.",1226102400,2,2068,4.803370786516854
2944416,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Way better than the original Halloween.
This version completes the story, explain why many stuff are there and on that way. I liked it very much. Instead, the original 1978 version lacks something.",1225929600,,197,5.0
2944417,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I won't go into a long review about the film, save to say it's not a great one, but I didn't find it extremely horrible either. It's a Rob Zombie movie in all respects (if I want to see Carpenter I'll watch the original, it's as simple as that), but it's never nearly as great as his previous film, The Devil's Rejects. It stays in apathy, just like the main character. A two hour biopic about a psychopath is hardly meant to be about cheers, but neither does this deliver on its scares. It's decent. I'd rate the unrated cut of the film 5 out of 10.

This edition is everything you could want out of the film and beyond. If you enjoyed it, or the absolutely excellent R2 DVD for The Devil's Rejects, this is perfect for you. There are all the briefer featurette segments from the previous DVD, which are enjoyable enough (the bloopers don't leave me in stitches, but they're somewhat funny), and there's also every screen test known to man (Rob must love to watch these early and stark readings for whatever reason). As just two discs, it's a somewhat decent special edition, putting into account that the film is unrated with eleven more minutes, and that Rob has a commentary on the entire film and all the deleted scenes. And speaking of those, they're actually pretty good, at least interesting to watch. There are a lot of moments there that the film could've used, but it's too bad there was nothing more with the female trio of the film, perhaps exactly all their scenes were used.

Then there's the third disc, with the most exhaustive (length-wise) documentary I've ever seen: ""Michael Lives: The Making of Halloween"". This four and a half hour-long documentary follows the entire pre-production and principal photography process in a rapid fire, day to day event style, including interview segments from Rob and his cast and crew. It shows you everything you could ever want to see about ""how it went down"", but I think it's too bad that there is almost nothing at all on post-production, even if that would've made this mammoth over five hours long. Less Rob wanting to dirty up sets, and more of editing, sound, music, promotion, premiere! Most of the entire thing is also ""coincidental"" camera, we're usually not given any specific context (which is sort of explained in the end credits, with a fun and quick segment of people wanting to continually kill or get rid of the cameraman shooting the documentary). Even if it's more about ""watching when Halloween was made"" than as detailed as Peter Jackson's great ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder: The Making of King Kong"", it's a very good documentary, and it will require more than a casual fan, a completely free afternoon and several cups of coffee or other stimulants to be watched.

With Halloween, Rob has done a pretty good job, but has overall delivered a lot more quantity than quality. It is appreciated though, because it's certainly better than the usual five-minute a**kisser segments that pass as special features these days.

Oh, and a small plus for the neat slipcase.",1225843200,2,3043,4.725047080979285
2944418,1,B000VKL6Z2,"First off I wish to say that I enjoyed Rob Zombie's other two films and that this review will contain spoilers for anyone who has not seen the other films in the HALLOWEEN series.

When I first heard about this movie I was extordinarly excited. I'm a HUGE fan of the HALLOWEEN series. I own all the movies ((except this one)) I even own Halloween 3 *which in case you didn't know, has NOTHING to do with Micheal*. So I started watching the movie and felt like i was going to scream, in a bad way. Here are a list of things Mr. Zombie did so horribly wrong.

1. Micheal killed ONLY his sister first
2. His parents were very normal loving people
3. Mr. Zombie tried to give Micheal a reason when HALLOWEEN 6 already did that
4. Is it just me or did this feel like and excuss for a little T & A
5. WAY to violent, yeah I know its horror, but the original one isn't like that
6. What is up with the ""lumbering bohemeth"" Micheal, I'm sorry but I'm more afraid of the little man that is strong enough to stick me three feet off the floor into a door with a kitchen knife
7. When did Mr. Zombie think it was a good idea to make Laurie a complete B***H!
8.((more something im disappointed in))Danielle Harris, love her as Jamie in HALLOWEEN 4 & 5, but as Annie...WTH?! It's like her acting ability just vanished.
9. Dr. Loomis...Okay I love Mr. McDowell and I actually liked him as Loomis, but Loomis is not that brave at first, he is actually afraid of Micheal in a way.
10. The ending, wow...it was just as much of a let down as the rest of the movie if not MORE.

okay there's my list, I'm sure there are a few things I forgot, but I think you get the point. I would also like to add that I do enjoy a GOOD remake (e.x. When A Stranger Calls) when they don't mess with the formula of the original to much. Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN not only didn't follow the formula but almost destroyed a true classic. I would suggest to any teenagers ((or anyone really)) reading this ((im 24 fyi)) to watch the ENTIRE series and don't even bother with this. John Carpenter's version ALL THE WAY!!",1225670400,14,2075,4.1825
2944419,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Many can understand the disappointment a remake can bring, but viewing it in a different perspective really helps. Nine times out of ten a remake fails to restore the magic the original held so high. Even with a large budget, powerful cultish fanbase, and inspired crew some movies just fail to deliver. Here we are with Halloween, a classic slasher from the late 70's. Holding key elements many slashers would religiously follow in the near future, Halloween spawned many seqauls but non seemed to really live up all as well. Also note Halloween (the original) was filmed with a measly budget.

Excessive gore, nudity, and screams dust off any filler most halloween films hold. Which is not positive thing, the frugal use of these really aided more in the dynamic swift kills the original held high. Instead of tension and release we get a snapshot of the masked maniacs childhood. With a rather long segment devoted to the development of a psychotic youths background, we are then bombarded with a short clean of suspense gore fest. It summarizes the original films story so fast and inorganically it almost feels like two films brought together.

If I sound critical, the positive begins here. I really enjoyed the revamped music, the shaky camera views, and the few twists on things. The very way Micheal's grimacing stares penetrate the hope in the victims, in my opinion, shows how terrifying deranged he's become. Standing taller then most combined with his physical strength well beyond normal human exertion he is quite the killer. This is a man who has remained mute for years, losing all sense of moral, filled with rage from childhood issues with a unthoroughly psychopathic nature. Never would he admit to his wrong doings. His blood lust slaying ways are basically encrypted as second nature by the half mark of the film. Gone is the child he once was.

So really the film kaputs the mysterious entity many liked. In return we get a more indepth view. Although not as good as the original and lacking many of the qualities, it still isn't a bad movie. With a few nods here and there to the old film, some might enjoy it, but many may not like the forced feeling. So it boils down to a entertaining, intensified, slasher ride. Many won't go for this as Rob Zombie has tarnished his name in the film industry ( I personally disagree), you be the judge and rent it.",1225411200,2,2376,4.734299516908212
2944420,2,B000VKL6Z2,"What a major disappointment this film is coming after the Devil's Rejects. I thought Zombie's directorial debut House of a 1,000 Corpses was too gross and graphic, which is exactly how I feel about this film, whereas the Devil's Rejects was so stylish and well told that you actually cared about the characters. This is just a pointless remake of one of the best horror films of all time. Zombie's intentions with this film were to tell the back story of Michael Myers and offer an explanation for why he was a ruthless psychotic killer. Did we really need an explanation? Isn't it better without? The problem is that the background info is so stereotypical. Mike's mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper. Her drunk boyfriend (William Forsythe) is a homophobe who teases Michael mercilessly. His sister thinks he is weird and for good reason since she walks in on him torturing and killing an animal while wearing a weird mask that he made. At school he is the target of bullies who make sexual comments about his mom and then beat him up. The principal does nothing since he doesn't like him either. The only person in his life who doesn't hate him despite his mother is his baby sister who is too young to have an opinion. Come Halloween night his mom is at work, his sister is upstairs having sex, and the boyfriend is passed out on the couch leaving Michael all alone with no one to take him trick or treating. He decides to go into the house, grab a knife and kill everyone save for his baby sister. When mom comes home she finds him calmly sitting on the steps holding the baby. He is arrested and institutionalized where a fame seeking doctor named Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) tries to analyze him and figure out why he did what he did. Michael isn't talking and doesn't for years prompting both Loomis and Michael's mother to give up on him. Fifteen years later Michael stages a violent escape from the institution and goes back to his hometown. Like in the original film we now meet Laurie (Scout Taylor Compton) and her fellow babysitting friends who are discussing their Halloween night plans. The other girls save for Laurie will be with their boyfriends while Laurie will be babysitting the neighbor's kids. By the end of the night Laurie will come face to face with pure evil as Dr. Loomis describes Michael. The doctor will team up with the sheriff (Brad Dourif) to try and stop Michael before he can carry out his mysterious mission. This is the only thing that makes this film different is the back story provided and it finally gives a reason for why Michael is seeking Laurie but those reasons alone don't make it a good film. It is graphically violent like Corpses was and lacks any of the style or wit of Devil's Rejects despite retaining half of that cast. The acting is pretty bad save for McDowell who gives a really good performance which isn't saying much after you see what a ham he is on the gag reel. There are tons of extras on the two disc set but they don't disguise how disappointing and unnecessary this film was. A major step backwards for Zombie as a director.",1225411200,4,3093,4.55475763016158
2944421,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Like many others have already said, this is a different perspective on the same story. I am a huge fan of Halloween, but was open to seeing how it can be retold. One aspect of this version I thoroughly enjoyed was the exploration of Michael's childhood. This was a point of controversy, as it humanizes and in a sense psychologically tries to explain Michael as a character. I felt it really was more social commentary since I don't think it was about explaining who he is, as much as a commentary on how we try to rationalize these kinds of behaviors as a society.

Again, this movie is very different, and everyone should at least take comfort that even if you don't like it, the original will always be there. I felt this was a fantastic re-telling or as it is called ""re-imagining"". Besides, I really felt this movie was a lot better than a lot of the follow up sequels that came after the original Halloween and Halloween 2.",1225411200,,929,4.464705882352941
2944422,5,B000VKL6Z2,"So, I won't start a debate on whether or not you like this film, as compared to the original, since the truth is---they are two different walks of life.

I love Zombie's remake. Does it hold a candle to the original? The point of Zombie's film is to recreate Halloween, not duplicate.

With that said, I've been a fan of the series since age 8. Now, 25 years later, with technology improving the way we watch these movies, I must say Zombie's Halloween on Blu-ray is more than worth the purchase.

The sound is incredible, for you home theater geeks out there. And the HD transfer is crystal.

As for the bonus features, what a treat to see a day by day behind the scenes documentary that made this film. The second blu-ray disc has a chapter menu that lets you watch the filming of this movie in 5 day shooting spurts, each section anywhere from 25-40 min long. 40-some days in total, and it's like being on the set and going through the ups and downs, the laughs, seeing the cast as family, and getting a window into how Zombie is a great horror director with vision, and a great relationship with his cast. And seeing how the cast brought this movie together. Die-hards like myself will love this--to the casual fan, maybe not.

This is one hell of a packed Blu-ray.",1225238400,3,1269,4.429184549356223
2944423,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The #1 ""Helpful Review"" on this site ridiculously gives this movie 1 star.  How on EARTH is this a 1-star movie?  I thought it was brilliantly done.  Going back and showing Michael Myers' progression into becoming a serial killer was not only a very smart movie, but it was pulled off extremely well.  Of course, a lot of the movie was predictable, especially after Michael became an adult, but that's what you expect from Halloween movies.

Nearly half of the movie is Michael as a child; finally reaching his breaking point after being bullied at school, and killing his first victim, then his entire family (except his sister, who we all know was Jamie Lee Curtis in all of the other Halloween movies).  I can't believe that I'm reading negative reviews about this portion of the movie.  It was brilliant in every regard.

Michael wasn't ""less scary"" because they showed a human side of him.  It probably made him MORE scary, because he was an absolute nut job.  He just flat out stopped talking one day, and never spoke another word ever again.  He was deranged, yet extremely intelligent, calculated, and precise.  A world class serial killer.  Showing his background added to the series, and made me appreciate the other Halloween movies even more, now that you got a look at a background story.

GREAT movie, and I highly recommend it.  4.5 stars.",1224892800,3,1354,4.75107296137339

2944425,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Sorry Zombie-philes. I like some of the guy's music, but he's a complete waste of celluloid as a director. Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' was the worst film of last year and one of the worst ever made. I'm not completely against remakes whatsoever. Films like 'The Fly', 'The Thing', 'The Blob', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' were all fantastic second-takes on classic movies. Admittedly, besides 'Dawn' I don't think I've seen a good remake in the past 5 years.

I was hopeful for Zombie's reinvention of Michael Myers. I will never fault someone for taking a franchise that pretty much crapped the bed, and trying to make it scary again. After 'H20' and the putrid 'Resurrection' I would have paid to see Michael in a college road trip flick for the possibility of an intentional laugh. Zombie instead took the reigns and delivered what I believe to be the worst 'Halloween' film in the entire series--and I have some hardcore hate for 'Revenge', 'H20' and 'Resurrection'.

This film fails in the first five minutes. The director can't stay away from white-trash characters filling his scenes with hilariously ridiculous dialogue. The fact that we're to follow Michael Myers from his awkward tween years on up is such a horrible misstep. We don't want to know what Michael Myers looks like in the principal's office. John Carpenter showed us a kid in a clown suit with a giant, bloody carving knife--and that was all we needed. It's scarier when we aren't held by the hand and shown exactly why a guy decides to put on a mask and kill people. All Rob had to do was tell a new story in Haddonfield and it would have sufficed. Instead we're subjected to countless poorly directed scenes with despicable characters you don't care about spouting high school-esque dialogue before being stabbed. It's pathetic filmmaking, and it's laughable that anyone involved in this honeybucket of a movie would try to justify its existence.

It's sad if the new generation of horror fans embrace drivel like this. Do yourselves a favor and buy Carpenter's masterful original. If you've already seen this then I hope you're one day able to burn it from your memory... I know I haven't been able to yet.",1224720000,6,2220,4.806282722513089
2944426,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I saw Halloween when it was release in Theaters and I loved the film. So when it came out on DVD, I went out and bought the Director's Cut to see what was added. I discovered that one of my favorite scenes was replaced! In the theatrical release, Micheal escaping from the guards was just a fun scene, but Rob Zombie felt 'it wasn't real enough,' so he replaced it with a rape scene.

So, Micheal breaking lose and killing a handful of guards, or two guys break into Micheal's cell to rape a girl (WTF) and Micheal just walks out (and kills the two guys). The director's cut also including pointless things like fading to black and it reading ""Halloween night."" Zombie must think his fans are retarded that we couldn't figure that out.

If you watch the director's cut and hated the movie, I don't blame you. But give the film another try and watch the theatrical release, it's way better. It's amazing, ask anyone who saw it in theaters.

2944427,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I am not going to over exaggerate in this review like most do with this film. Let's get one thing straight, remakes will never be better than the original. You will never again experience a remake the same way you experienced the original because it isn't fresh anymore. You knows whats going to happen, and most of the time nothing is changed. A film should never be called a remake unless it truly is a remake, a new vision, something not entirely like the original. Pay homages to the original, but never do it scene for scene, or shot for shot, like Gus Van Sants Psycho. Make it your own, and a true remake. Build up upon what was already great.

With a film as fantastic as Halloween, its very hard to do a remake of it because it did everything right. It had absolutely no blood, only a creepy atmosphere and suspense throughout. How do you remake a film like Halloween? You make it your own and show another vision for today's generation.

Rob Zombie did just this, while paying homage to the original. While the film may contain the same characters and certain scenes, they are no way in hell done the way they were done in the original. Zombie takes a more modern approach, understanding how most girls today talk (Yes, they can be this bad-mouthed in the real world, dare I say worse) and knowing today that almost all horror films are filled with blood and gore. I am not for blood and gore, but I have learned to accept that it is present in all Rated R horror films today.

The worst part of the film is the explanation for why Michael is the way he is. It's just weak scripting, and he turns evil in a flash. It sort of reminded me of how quick Anakin turned to the dark side in Star Wars Episode 3, its that quick, but it doesn't bother you once he begins to kill those in the household with the new version of Carpenters theme playing in the background.

The acting is great all around, but there are two lines in the film that are horribly delivered, and they are both within 10 seconds.

""Was that the bogeyman?""

""As a matter of fact, I do believe it was.""

Can you even use the words ""As a matter of fact"" and ""I do believe"" in the same sentence? Moving on.

I am shocked to see that this film has a 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, because the film isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. When you put it side-by-side with other remakes, you could certainly do a helluva lot worse. Just take the film as another vision of John Carpenters horror classic, unlike most did, and you should appreciate what you are given here.

PQ: Fantastic. This is new demo material. The constant zoom-ins in the film show a great amount of detail, and the black levels are great.

AQ: One of the better TrueHD soundtracks to come from the Weinsteins. The scene when Michael is stabbing at the ceiling will push your system.

Supplements: All of the supplements from the previous DVD are on one disk, with another disk containing the documentary. Most of them are fairly interesting. I haven't got to the documentary yet.

The film: 7/10

The blu-ray: 5/5",1224633600,3,3061,4.386925795053004

I was excited to say the least when I first heard he'd direct a Halloween remake and eagerly awaited the film to hit theatres.  I just remember sitting through the movie with my girlfriend being incredibly bored and in awe at how bad this movie was.  It just was not scary what so ever. I so wanted to like to the movie, that even half way through I was telling myself it will get better. I was really dissapointed and it really bumped down Rob's skills as a film maker in my book.",1224460800,3,551,4.130841121495327
2944429,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Upon the anticipation of one of my favorite holidays, I felt it was necessary, if not crucial to dabble in some suspenseful and horrifying cinema this week. The suspense, or lack thereof, mostly resulted into a depressing and horrific cinematic experience. It was so horrifying to see a remake fail in all aspects, visually and cinematically that I could almost hear John Carpenter's hair turn whiter as he chain-smokes his last and final cigarette.

The truth is I happen to be a fan of Rob Zombie's previous films; moreover, I appreciated his passion for cult horror movies that sometimes incorporated the sort of nostalgic drive-in movie era. Upon hearing a remake of Carpenter's classic, I became annoyed and disappointed at first, but was soon relieved to find out it was someone not only worthy of creativity but truly passionate about these type of slasher films that Zombie cares about so much. Boy, was I profoundly disappointed in Zombie's ""re-imaging"" of Halloween, or shall I call it a sheer massacre.

For the first 45-50 minutes of the film, We get a lengthy and interminable back round of Michael's Myer's psychology; the rationale; he comes from a broken home with a mother who strips late night to make ends meet, a dead-beat father figure who incessantly call his boy, ""faget"", and an uncaring older sister who is about as uninteresting as the film. At school, it is no different as Michael endures a myriad of tortures from school bullies who appear about as non-threatening as a senile old lady. The young boy playing Michael Myer's childhood was disturbing in the sense that he was scarier looking without the mask as his girlish blonde hair, pre-adolescent chubby face and crooked teeth rendered him retarded looking. The bottom line is that Rob Zombie's approach into making Michael Myer's character more sympathetic to the audience truly defies John Carpenter's intentions. I honestly loathed the weak climatic build up of Michael Myer's mental breakdown if you could call it that; personally it looked like a rebellious pre-pubescent hissy fit. It was a tough pill to swallow to take Myer's childhood seriously and even more so when he's battering his sister's boyfriend brains with a baseball bat, or slitting William Forsythe's throat. Even Malcolm Mcdowell's psychological evaluation of Michael Myer's meltdown in the mental institution came off as incredibly corny adding entirely no substance to the film; it was uninformative and just plain boring. I just hope they paid Mcdowell a pretty penny to waste his valuable acting skills on this film, but that is beside the point.

After the long introduction horror fans of the genre finally get to see the true modern Michael Myer's we've been waiting for, the result, a 280 lb. 6'8 gorilla. Hey who would of thought Michael Meyer's physique would mimic an NFL coaches wet dream. This is another problem I had with this film, Rob Zombie thought it was necessary to seriously upgrade Myer's physique, bad idea... what were they feeding this kid at the mental institution, HGH and testosterone! His figure looks overbearing in the film to the point where his on-screen presence looks inhuman and far too dominating as his broad shoulders and towering height look more like a Caterpillar bulldozer at a construction site. In all seriousness, I had difficulty deciphering whether Myer's was suffering from middle-child syndrome or exhibiting symptoms of roid rage, which is probably the only mysterious enigma about Myer's Psychology in the entire film. Personally, I thought what made Carpenter's Myer's more frightening is that he appeared more average and less animated. It was his slow but persevering amble that gave me the chills, not a fast over dominating beast that broke through every door and main beam in that house. It was ridiculous and nauseating to witness Zombie's over extended chase scenes that really amounted to sheer emptiness and dissatisfaction in the end. In other words, the pay-off sucked big time. The editing overall was pretty weak as well, a few interesting wide-angle shots in the mental institution accompanied by more mundane uninteresting chase scenes. Rob Zombie also upgrades the violence as well but it fails miserably to compensate for the lack of suspense. As a result, the violence comes off as incredibly gratuitous and unwarranted. However, I cannot bash the nudity even though it delivered the same unjustified result as the violence. It was almost as if Robb Zombie was forcing the nudity as if saying, ""I can show bush in my Halloween and get away with it"".

Despite my criticism, there are some few and sparse redeeming qualities such as the authenticity of recapturing the 1970's feel which Rob Zombie subtlety recaptures and manages to weave into the film. Sheri Moon Zombie actually pulls it off kind of nicely, maybe it was her carefully selected wardrobe or her soft dirty blonde hair, couldn't tell you but her looks worked for the time being. Her acting is another story, I won't go there, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say its serviceable at best. Rob Zombie throws in some 70's one hit wonders, some Blue oyster Cult, which is also featured in Carpenter's version when Jamie Lee Curtis is driving with PJ Soles, Rush and Nazareth. The only interesting relationship I found was that between Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers in the mental institution and Sid Haig's quick cameo, other than that the character development was extremely weak leaving me disconnected from relating to anybody.
 I did get through most of the bonus features and even some of that 4  hour documentary. There are some interesting bonus features, just about enough to last you through next Halloween. Horror Fans will enjoy the 2nd disc with interviews and behind the scenes, along with a 3rd disc step by step ""making of documentary of the entire movie. Despite Rob Zombie's catastrophic reimaging of a Horror classic, I have to applaud his audaciousness for actually exposing how he screwed up a classic in the infamous 4  documentary. But seriously, it is interesting to see how a film is made and how frustrating it is to meet deadlines, deal with actors, prop sets you name it. There is a great deal patience and articulation in respect to guiding your actors, script and photography.  The film is certainly not a good remake, more like horrendous but the bonus features can keep you occupied for a bit if your interested in making films.",1224374400,4,6458,4.973148148148148

2944432,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Watching Rob Zombie's Halloween was a pretty interesting experience. When I rented it, I was pretty sure it would suck, as all remakes invariably do. Then I started watching it. I started to get mad, thinking ""this movie is lame"" because it is a COMPLETELY different take on the classic Halloween storyline. Its so different its almost a completely separate movie. I realized I was getting angry because Rob's movie wasn't following the original. What a silly thing! To want a cookie-cutter REMAKE when Rob's movie was a clever and successful 'reimagining'.
  Don't watch this movie expecting Halloween. Watch it as a stand-alone movie, and you will appreciate what a good job Rob Zombie did at what seemed to be an impossible task (equalling the original). The movie does take quite a while to really get rolling, so stick with it. Once the good stuff arrives (and you all know what that means) there are some truly frightening and suspenseful scenes (and better than the original!). While I would still rate the original Halloween higher than Rob Zombie's version, I must say I was impressed with his fresh take on the story, and his excellent handling of the scary scenes. If you like horror movies, check this one out!",1224201600,2,1222,4.842105263157895
2944433,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Since so many people have railed on Zombie's Halloween for the same reasoning -- with a backstory, Michael is less scary -- I wanted to present an alternate opinion. Looking at it entirely from the perspective of the remake and trying to put Carpenter's admittedly classic original out of my head, I thought the backstory was fascinating, I also thought the first 40 minutes or so were the best part of Zombie's reimagining, and when Michael was breaking out of the compound to go on his signature rampage, I was particularly happy with the film (Michael's relationship with Danny Trejo is one of the best elements of the film).

However, when the focus turns to Haddonfield, the film turns to s---. Zombie has cast, or written -- in the case of the main character, I'm not really sure -- the three most annoying girls in the history of cinema. Every line out of their mouths made my head ache and I longed for the characters from the original movie. Even Danielle Harris, who was fairly charming in Halloween 4 and 5, is as shrill and grating as the other two. The only advantage to Zombie's movie in this aspect is that since it spends so much time with Michael as a boy, this section of the movie is naturally sped up. After Michael had dispatched a couple of them the movie started to get back on track, but had this section resembled Carpenter's more closely, I might have just turned the movie off.

Regardless, I thought Halloween 07 was interesting. For all the horrible, uninspiring, Xerox-level remakes out there (like, for instance, the shot-for-shot remake Quarantine, which at every opportunity has spoiled the original, [REC] for me), at least Zombie made a film that is unquestionably his, containing hallmarks and themes from the original, but is a distinctly different film.",1223769600,4,1791,4.774193548387097
2944434,1,B000VKL6Z2,"95% of remakes have no reason to exist - And only work in the hands of genius filmmakers.  I believe that Rob Zombie has talent, but his sensibilities are Tobe Hooper/Geek Show attraction.  This is perfect for House of 1,000 Corpses or Devil's Rejects but doesn't lend itself to Halloween at all.  John Carpenter grew up on Howard Hawks (which shows in Assault on Precinct 13) and JC's remakes of Howard Hawks production, The Thing.  Rob Zombie may've been impacted by Halloween but doesn't understand it the way John Carpenter understood The Thing.  That's the problem.

Though some remakes are valid - the trouble of a remake is: Good or Bad - it erases the original film from public memory.  This is a problem, especially in horror because the next generation of horror fans will grow up without knowledge and respect for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and soon - A Nightmare on Elm St.

In he 2007 Halloween, nearly an hour is wasted on Michael's Trashy upbringing in one of the most pointless origin stories ever put on screen since The Grinch.  What made John Carpenter's Halloween so scary is that Michael can't be expalined - he had a good family.  His evil is a mystery which is what makes him fascinating.  Rob Zombie's may be true to life but it's boring as hell.

Then the last 40 minutes is a sped up re-make of the original.  We don't get any time to know the kids and none of them are even remotely interesting.  As a fan of Zombie's first two films - I anticipated this one, knowing he was wrong for it, but hoping he'd pull it off and make something interesting.

I was wrong, both he and Neil Marshal (with Doomsday) neutralized the impact of their last two fascinating films.  The Descent and Devil's Rejects were refreshing detours from the stupid Saw and Eli Roth films.  These haven't been easy years for horror fans and this film is yet another major setback.",1223769600,5,1900,4.607142857142857
2944435,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of The Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, and now Halloween. All originals were independent productions made with limited budgets that found worldwide success due to the fact they were simply well made original films. Leave it to Hollywood to do some sloppy cut n paste jobs with some hack/poser directors cashing in hard earned name recognition, basically they see something so old making more money consistently over the years when their modern dull horror flicks fail to be remembered once they're out of theaters so they create some mock-ups with the same name and cut in front of line. All these new horror remakes are BORING to their very core, the violence isn't even ""XTREEEME"" as they try to make it out to be, even if there is more blood than the originals (well Dawn of The Dead remake was no where near as graphic as the original on top of being moronic/annoying).
  Well here's Rob Zombie's Halloween. Rob Zombie is a terrible writer and a lousy director, he belongs directing Saw movies or some straight to DVD horror flicks, this is easily the worst horror remake since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it might be even worse than that one. The film has vague character outlines but nothing much else, and don't say it doesn't matter because a good hour of this movie is devoted to fall-flat-on-its-face character development that is nonexistent. There is setup, location, some empty lines, and well its so amateurish, either the door is wide open for some real talent to save horror or it really is over for the genre.
  The payoff at the end of the film is very cut n paste. Its no better or worse than any Halloween sequel, well its not even as good as 2 or 4. Since its a new movie the camera is constantly shaking around and there's that fake ""realistic"" brutality/dying/screaming acting that is so forced its just annoying. There is nothing worse in my opinion than something that believes it is truly shocking and in your face when in truth it is very plain and kind of dull. Every minute of this movie is like that down to the throwaway horror cameo characters, which are haphazard cussfests that attempt to be funny but are just, I dunno, lame. Zombie's downtrodden ""everyone is stupid"" modernistic attitude kills every frame of the movie, as if none of the characters he wastes over an hour on matter because MICHAEL MYERS is coming and this time he seems to be based on professional wrestler Kane or The Undertaker. Which is fitting, this is a very modern mall goth approach to story telling, and Rob Zombie is mall metal with an audience that could never hope to name the origins of horror film samples found in his music so I don't know. Michael Myers jumps out and stabs lots of people but its nothing too graphic or interesting, there's no suspense, buildup or pay off. Its just kind of there.
  John Carpenter's early films were minimalist, Rob Zombie films are excessive, so its only ironic his film comes off as an empty exercise in generic slasher fare. The late 80s are back I guess.",1223683200,10,3039,4.639405204460966
2944436,5,B000VKL6Z2,"The 1st thing I noticed about this movie was it was from the point of view of the hunter instead of the hunted. For the 1st time wee see what Michael sees not what his victims see. This version does an extensive build up of the Michale Myres character from his child hood of abuse- how his step dad mentally and physically abuses him and how his sister ignores him. We learn how he was picked on at school to the point this small 10 yr old snaps. We also get to learn about his obsession with masks and how he dealt with being in the mental institution as well as how he escaped and the storyline of how he became the monster he was in the previous movies. The 1st part of the movie gets the viewer to see exactly what happened to this small child to push the right buttons to create the perfect killing machine.
.
The cinematography was great from the film color dating the movie back 20 yrs. With some modern changes to how high school kids act now a days to add to the realism. The blood wasn't over done or digitalized. Zombie kept a sense of realism that made the movie that much more believable raising the scare factor.

Of course if you follow zombies previous films you will see a hand full of actors and actresses make an appearance from time to time. The children actors did an amazing job as well. The other thing I liked was I never got bored. I remember the old slasher flicks like the Freddy and the Jason films as well as the old Halloween movies- during scenes of character development there was a lot of boring dialog that slowed the movies down to a crawl and lost my interest until another sex scene or another killing depending on the film I was watching. This movie manager to negate all that boring sluggishness development and still create a character on the screen.",1223424000,,1790,4.3273809523809526

2944438,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I was very interested in an updated version of the film, plus the previews looked really dark and creepy.  Unfortunately, I went and saw the movie...

For one, ALL of the characters have abnormally filthy mouths.  Even Laurie had a filthy mouth, which made it very hard to think of her as a victim I'd want to survive.

Secondly, I don't need a lengthy biography on Michael.  I wish they'd just leave at him being a born sociopath.  Instead they made it due to child abuse and being picked on in school.  What was interesting in the first one was when the parents run up to Michael after he's stabbed Judith to death and the parents look completely normal; their son is just crazy.  Also in this remake here, Judith was an awful person and I was completely apathetic to her death.  In fact, she pretty much deserved.  I prefer innocent victims.

Rob Zombie knows how to create an awesome atmosphere, but he should NOT write his own scripts.  He makes his characters so hard to like and they all have mouths like a bunch of uneducated trash.

Apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie, but I hated every single character and basically sided with Michael despite how much I already hated his character.  In my opinion, this movie is an enormous failure and it does not deserve this 3 disc special edition.",1222905600,40,1307,4.52991452991453
2944439,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm not a big horror fan. My housemates have repeatedly talked me into watching slasher film after slasher film, and I still just can't get into the genre. But this film is different. This film is actually really good. And that's not to say that other slasher films aren't. (I could never discredit the Scream series.) Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" just goes beyond the simple bad-guy-with-a-knife stereotype and delivers an amazingly scary and sad story of a well-known fictional psychopath.

In this version of ""Halloween"", director Rob Zombie doesn't just retell the original story in his own style - he retells it well: Zombie's ""Halloween"" is more of a biography of Michael Myers than a slasher film staring Michael Myers. The first and best example of this is the opening act of the film: the back-story of Myers's childhood is almost thirty minutes long. (Most slasher films tell the back-story in a short five-minute teaser before the opening credits.) Once the audience is attached to Myers' character, the story progresses to show Myers' troubled life in a mental institution, his escape from the mental institution and finally his killing spree. Most films wouldn't go into this much detail on the nemesis's character which is what makes Zombie's version so good.

Overall, this movie will likely appeal more to horror fans but non-horror fans, such as myself, may enjoy it too. Yes, it shows blood and guts, but it's a great retelling of Michael Myers's story and I highly recommend it.",1222819200,2,1493,4.991967871485944

But being a die hard and working my way to old timer I liked the perspective change to the main characters point of view. The over use of nudity reminded me of much of the schlock in the 1980's. Malcolm McDowell's performance as the kindly doctor seemed too sloppy considering the caliber of actor he is. Most of the cast were all top notch in their character portrayals for the quality of actors present. If you are a fan of any of Rob Zombies other films you will recognize old favorites returning in new rolls. It was a good attempt at breathing new life into the old franchise but seemed a bit rushed in scripting and a bit in production you can tell by the dialog. The film seems to drag a bit in the end when most fans are ready to move on to something else.  The saving grace for me was the sets, cinematography, and yes even the some of the slapstick dialogue. Not since Mortal Combat and Manos the Hands of Fate have I stopped a movie dead in its tracks to confirm that I heard what I thought I did. Look if you are home alone on Saturday night and feel like self medicating and watching a new movie you will like it. Now if the Idea of a good time is watching a film by H.G.

It spends the first hour giving backstory to how Michael Myers came to be the unstoppable killer he becomes when he grows older.  While that was fascinating to endure, in the end it ultimately felt empty, unnecessary, and not believable.  The acting wasn't that great in the backstory by any of the players.  They seemed to over do it and try to hard.  Screaming absurd dialogue at one another to the point where I just wanted to smack them to chill out.  The original Halloween is much like the original Psycho movie.  Nothing can come close to the classics.  John Carpenter's Halloween had little gore, but managed to create atmosphere and fright.  This Halloween is heavy on the gore, but it lacked suspense.  I enjoyed it merely to see a new take on Halloween.  It was entertaining to a degree while feeling disjointed and all over the place at times.

With the Devils Rejects it once again became massively overstated that he was capable of much more as an artist and a writer than we could ever have predicted, and the shocking violence and intesity becomes addictive and always memorable. Zombie's remake of the legendary classic Halloween brings him full circle as an intelligent creative individual with his trademark of stark realism and uninhibited aggression. Zombie's films are honored as landmarks in the genre and equally praised by followers as he praised these films in his own music. Rob Zombies Halloween is one of the most effective looks at the nature and motivations of violence and sociopathology in horror cinema, and each film stands as a relevant social/political commentary that mocks the multifaceted and seemingly facist agenda of the MPAA and the PMRC. thankfully the cast of the films remains standard, giving the terrifying worlds that Zombie creates an ominous familiarity.

The most innovative and creative part of Zombie's film is the first hour where he explores the birth of a serial killer. Zombie's extraordinary depiction of Michael's life in a hellish home where domestic violence is the norm and sexually explicit language abounds is so well done. The young actor who portrays Michael is perfect. Sherri Moon Zombie plays Michael's mother quite well and even throws in a pole dance for good measure. Michael's life in a mental institution is also extremely well done, culminating in a bloody murder spree as he escapes. One wishes Zombie had stopped there and called the film: ""Halloween: The Beginning"". Unfortunately,the last 45 minutes of the film consists of an extremely weak and hurried remake of Carpenter's original film. Laurie Stode, Michael's sister, is so annoying that you will want to kill her yourself. She wines and screams all the time and it's merciful when Michael kills her equally annoying friends. The last 20 mintues of this bloody mess are pure agony -- a confusing mishmash of mayhem as Michael knocks holes in an attic, trying to pry Laurie out. So dumb. I must, however, compliment Malcom McDowell on his performance as Dr. Loomis. He brings dignity to a role that was owned by Donald Pleasance. An odd and annoying thing about this film is the confusion about the time in which it is set. The musical soundtrack is late 70's, but people are using cell phones. Guys have long hair, but girls are wearing clothes that appear to be at least 90's stuff. Just makes your head want to explode. Runtime is about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Way too long and absolutely exhausting. Trust me, the original and most of its sequels are better ways to spend your time.",1217635200,,2333,5.824561403508772
2944448,3,B000VKL6Z2,"In order to make this a more brief and positive review, I will disregard the entire first half of the film.  Rob Zombie should have kept Michael's personality and motives more of a mystery, because I think this aspect of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is what has helped to make it a timeless genre masterpiece.
  That said, I believe that the last hour of the film is quite faithful to the original film, and even takes it to highs that John Carpenter, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis would never have imagined.
The actor playing adult Michael in this film is much larger than Nick Castle was in 1978's ""Halloween"", and this immediately makes him more frightening.  The pace of the last hour is swift and flawless, and Zombie wisely pays homage to many scenes and set-pieces of the original movie.  The Doyle house is particularly cinematic and creepy, even more so than the Meyer's house.  There are odes to the original, which Zombie was wise to include, and Carpenter's original score is used generously and respectfully.
  Malcolm McDowell is a good doctor Loomis, very different from Donald Pleasence's performance, and necessarily so.  Scout Taylor-Compton is a terrific Laurie Strode, in the final scenes especially, but she squints too much, and it was like watching a performance from one of those apple-face dolls.  The real revelation of this film is Danielle Harris.  She wipes away her Jamie Lloyd persona (her character from ""Halloween"" 4&5) completely, and emerges as a new form of scream queen.  Her Annie Brackett is more believable than the other actresses' performances, and Annie's anguished attempts to warn Laurie out of the Wallace house were the most blood-curdling screams I've ever heard in a movie.  I don't know where Danielle Harris got those unearthly cries, but they are anguished and unforgettable.  I believe that this is the best acting that she's done.
  There's also a particularly great bonus feature on the second disc - Adrienne Barbeau's deleted scene!  She looks incredible, quite like she did in ""The Fog"", and her scene just crackles with tension.  Too bad it didn't make it into the final cuts of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"".",1215907200,,2166,4.9529085872576175
2944449,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I saw the original Halloween in theaters and loved it. Have seen it many times since, and Carpenter's version is great. Just about all the sequels blew one way or the other, changing Michael Myers from a lunatic into an unstoppable juggernaut. Bullets can't stop him! Fire can't stop him! Decapitation can't stop him! Who cares anymore?! This began a whole trainload of bat guano mascarading as horror/splatter flicks like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elmstreet, ad naseum, with monsters that can't be killed and teenagers who can, and are, no matter how clever they are. The fanboy geeks love it because their sophistication level isn't exactly stellar, let's face it.

This is why Rob Zombie made House of 1,000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects - to bring the horror back into horror films. The creepiness level and humor that made the early genre so great is missing during later entrees - and even more so in the whole alleged ""re-invention"" with crapola like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Saw, Hostel....

Zombie's Halloween is a slightly different film than Carpenters, almost as if you are seeing the same story from another perspective. And it's brilliant. The first half (the part many horror nerds gripe about because they can't stand characterization and just want to see gore and blood and some dumb creep in a halloween mask killing people as fast as he can - ""what's the body count, dude?"") is riveting and far more interesting than the 2nd half, which plays out like the original movie. But even that part is great. This movie has got to be one of the best ""slasher flicks"" of all time. I can't wait to see what Rob comes up with next.",1215388800,3,1657,4.710344827586207
2944450,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career, in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film, HALLOWEEN, Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.

Everyone already knows the tale of Michael Myers, the psychopath from Haddonfield, IL, who murdered his sister only to be committed to an institution he would later escape from with the intent of more killings back home years later. While that is the basis for Zombie's film, it is not a remake but more of a retelling, a reinvention of the same character.

Here we are offered young Michael and the household he grows up in that forms his life. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper, saddled with a new husband (William Forsythe) who is disabled and a neer do well more interested in yelling at the kids than in offering any sort of role model. Michael's sister is a trashy sleep with anyone teen who dresses provocatively and does little else. All of this is not lost on Michael who spends his time killing his pets and taking photos of them. What we are being offered is a textbook glimpse as to why a youngster becomes a serial killer. The nice middle class family shown in the original is tossed aside for this new group. And in this first portion of the film, the problems Zombie has are apparent.

Zombie has filled three films now with the same characters. Sure, they may have different names and different small time characteristics, but the fact remains that he focuses on the dysfunctional family and their housecleaning inabilities. Yes, it seems that all families in Zombie's world can't clean to save themselves. Not only that but they all have the same dingy look to their living quarters as well as references to pop culture. The house Michael grows up in could be a home that the Firefly family would feel comfortable in. It all looks the same and that detracts greatly from the viewing experience, unless of course you'd never seen another Rob Zombie film.

Comparisons to the original film are inevitable and this will most likely be the downfall of the film in the long run. Michael goes overboard with his murderous rampage as a child in this film unlike the original. Where no blood was seen in that film, it flows freely now. Perhaps this is due to the changing times, but it adds nothing to the scares of the film or the character. It does make him a more brutal killer, leaving him one without a touch of sympathy. But the mindless killer from the original is replaced by someone we feel absolutely nothing for now.

Once finished with the whole back story of young Michael, his family and the kindly Dr. Loomis (Michael McDowell) who takes care of him at the institution, we move forward 15 years to when Michael escapes and heads back home. The body count increases once more as he kills everyone he comes into contact with their, including a worker who had befriended him. Once out, the story becomes more familiar, almost a duplicate of the original shot from different angles, with different actors and focusing less on the character of Laurie Strode, the central character in John Carpenter's version.

Laurie and her friends are nothing more than meat to be slaughtered by Michael in this one. There is no development of character, no reason for us to think of them as more than teens in peril that we have seen in hundreds of other slasher flicks. While we cared about the original teens, this time around they seem less human and placed in our way for two reasons: to be killed by Michael and to offer more exposed flesh than the first.

By the film's end we are offered the traditional sliced and diced teens, gratuitous nudity and enough blood to make a special effects company weep for joy at the size of their bill. But we have gained nothing in the iconography that is Michael Myers. While we are given more background on him, we care less about him than we ever did.

Worst of all is the fact that Rob Zombie, a director that showed such great potential before, seems to be telling us after only three films that this is all he has to offer. Stories told from the same world, a world that blasts apart the whole FATHER KNOWS BEST world we would all like it to be. In his world, there is no caring parent. And when they are caring, they are twisted in some revolting way.

I haven't given up on Zombie yet though. Having recently signed a two picture deal with the Weinstein's, perhaps he will show us he has more tricks up his sleeve than he let on. But if he returns to the carnie soiled world he's offered in three films to date, then it looks as though he's a one note director. Let's hope he offers us more. It's in there somewhere.",1214524800,12,4947,4.54320987654321
2944451,5,B000VKL6Z2,"There's far more Rob Zombie bashing in these reviews than is needed so I'm going to twist it back. John Carpenter may have came up with a great idea with ""Halloween"" but his version was always an overrated horror classic and a blatant ripoff of the original ""Black Christmas"". Bashing Zombie for remaking a ""classic"" in his own way is like bashing Carpenter for remaking ""The Thing"" in his own way. The major difference is ""The Thing"" is the only good Carpenter movie. Had he only written ""Halloween"" and let someone else direct it and had a better cast for it, it might have been a classic. Some common complaints with my rebuttal:

Malcolm McDowell vs Donald Pleasence: McDowell is criticized for overacting? You're joking! What has every role Pleasence has taken on been? Good drama? You can tell he started as a stage actor and he should have stayed there. Don't worry, Don, we get the point that only you can understand why Michael Myers is doing what he's doing and we can also understand why no one will listen to you when you're acting more like a lunatic than a doctor.

Scout Taylor-Compton vs Jamie Lee Curtis: JLC was never the scream queen as far as I was concerned and I commend her for realizing that so early in her career and getting out of horror. Does anyone care to remember Prom Night? I doubt she does. She did an okay job in Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and you didn't want to see her get killed but Scout Taylor-Compton was far more convincing in Zombie's ""Halloween"". It could have been the way her character was written, though, because she has no idea that Myers is her brother and, in the end, she fights harder and shows more fear than our heroine did in the original movie.

Sluts vs Sluts: People have complained about the ""sluts"" in Zombie's version. Times have changed, people, and there's not much we can do about it, but let's not forget that there were sluts in the original version also, and back then no-one complained. I fail to see the point in this argument. Read the rating on the back of the DVD and it will tell you why the movie is Rated R or 18A. You shouldn't be shocked then when you watch the film.

Rob Zombie vs John Carpenter: Zombie has shown more style and promise with ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Halloween"" than I could have predicted. He's cutting edge and definitely knows how to push buttons. Carpenter has had his shining moment(s), ""Halloween"" (to some) and ""The Thing"" but that's a long time ago. But I'll give him this saving grace: He always wrote better music than Rob Zombie or White Zombie ever did.

All in all, I found Zombie's version very suspenseful and fearful, and I've enjoyed repeated viewings to the same degree. I can understand why this movie might be too much for some people, but to call it garbage because there's too much gore...well, you might as well call Carpenter's ""The Thing"" garbage for the same reason.",1213574400,2,2887,4.576402321083172

2944456,4,B000VKL6Z2,"As I have said in other reviews, the unrated versions of films on DVD have become the defacto Gold Standard.
I saw this film in theatre and I was wowed by the power and impact of film, even though the supernatural element seemed a little drained from the film. For someone like Rob Zombie, the surreal seems to reign supreme in his art, but that was in what I saw in the Booklet art of HELLBILLY DELUXE, however, in film Rob seems to want to go for the ""real"".
 The First part of the film was, as I understand it, shot basically shot in sequence, so that by the time they got to Institution sequences, not only has the Young actor playing Michael actually Grown, but Tyler Mane gets a chance to incorporate Young Michaels moves into his own styles. Probably the most shocking scenes and therefore the best items to watch and pick apart, take place at the Institution, the Truck Stop ( Ken Foree is just so Cool in a scene he makes so his own, even though you have two huge guys obviously trying to outdo each other, and this is more
so when you realise that the side of the stall they damage is NOT the stunt stall, its the real metal), and the element I find most surprising is that whilst Young Michael ( the actor) needs a stunt double, so does [ they said] the Huge Tyler Mane;Tyler Objected to the Double on one point, and the double for ""Young Michael"" is a girl... my question is, before hearing the commentary or the features, can you pick them ?
Anyways, This Unrated is a very well deserved edition. Expect more... you might even pick up some of the tricks on how Michael Hides in a shot, when he is 6'9 and hard to miss.

DVD: The Bonus Features. Standout features on this are the deleted scenes or the Bloopers where Malcolm McDowell and Brad Douriff do a brilliant job at riffing off each other ( if only these two had been contracted to do a Commentary track with cast).The Features are worth it indeed. The Commentary however, is technically informative, but dry and unentertaining as you could have it. If they are going to have a film school class track, they could at least have an entertaining commentary track. Rob's ""Commentary as Director"" track has its purpose, but it needed a track for more entertaining elements.",1212192000,,2238,4.429611650485437

2944459,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's Halloween has breathed new life into the series for me.  It is in my opinion, that many people don't like this version of Halloween, simply because it is not the original.  Many people feel as though ""classic"" movies should be left alone.  However, for those who can accept that classics are not some sacred piece of work that can never be touched, this version of Halloween has a lot to offer on its own.

Unlike the original Halloween, this version of Halloween gives us some insight into Michael Myers' past, while taking a few liberties from the original.

In the original Halloween, it is kind of implied that Michael Myers came from a normal family, and for some unexplained reason he decided to murder his sister.  Then the story fast forwards 15 years.  In Zombie's Halloween, Michael Myers comes from a ""white trash"" dysfunctional family.  His mother is a stripper, his step-father is verbally abusive, and his older sister is neglectful and self-centered.  At school, Myers is bullied by older, bigger students.

As the story progresses, we learn that Michael shows some psychopathic symptoms, such as the enjoyment of harming and killing animals while showing no remorse.

In this re-imagining of the original, we even get to see Michael during his time in the mental institution, and we witness the character drift further into the ""darkness"" and become more evil.  Another thing I liked, was we get to see how Michael got his mask (we even find out why he wears a mask).  In the original, Michael escapes the mental institution, stole a random mask at a hardware store, and that's that.  In this version of Halloween, the mask actually kind of has a story of its own.

Eventually the story essentially picks up where the original Halloween starts, and in fact, many of the scenes are re-created nearly shot for shot.  This has turned off many, but for me, I actually like it.  It kinda brought everything full circle from him being certified into the mental institution, to his escape, and then to where things started in the original Halloween.

Many people also didn't like how ""human"" Michael Myers seems in this version of Halloween.  I take what they mean by that is, we know too much of the character.  Where in the original, he was a killer who just kinda showed up out of nowhere and started killing for no apparent reason.  However, I also disagree with this.  In Zombie's Halloween, Michael Myers is scarier than he has ever been.  He is very scary.  For the very fact that there could be a real life ""Michael Myers"" among us.  He isn't just some supernatural killer who only shows up in nightmares.  And he isn't some mindless, unstoppable zombie with a machete.  Michael Myers could be among us.  There could very well be someone who has suffered severe trauma at some point in life, who is being consumed by emotional darkness.  Hopefully not, but the possibly is could very easily happen.

Overall, if your a purist, then this movie will only disappoint.  However, if you like Halloween, but can accept that this movie is a new movie, not a sequel to the last Halloween, and not meant to be a direct re-make of the original, then this movie should be pleasantly entertaining. I consider it the best of the Halloween movies so far.",1209859200,5,3270,4.724381625441696

The script and characters are cardboard and plot holes (like what happened to the sheriff after he found his daughter?) plague this dud.  Yes, I know, horror films are noted for brilliant narratives but the original was effective in its simplicity.  Michael's back story took way too long -- was it even needed? -- and there was no sense of climax.  The only thing this film proves is that Malcolm McDowell should have retired after his classic turn in ""A Clockwork Orange.""

It seems that Zombie grows white trash on a farm and incorporates every said type of actor into his movies, and this one goes to the extreme on that regard.  Tons and tons of needless cussing and nudity, not to mention a rape scene that is beyond too much.  Also, there are lengthy periods of time during this movie that you struggle not to fall asleep.  I will say that I enjoyed the incorporation of the original Halloween music throughout the movie, not just the theme music but pretty much all of the tunes from the first.

2944463,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Ridley Scott's American Gangster about real life bad guy and drug lord, Frank Lucas, in American Gangster receives two Oscar noms.  Forrest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin.  Who says you can't do a biopic film of a fictional character?  Rob Zombie does just that in this biography, not remake, of horror icon Michael Myers.  I would also guess that more Americans have probably heard of the fictional, Michael Myers, than Amin, or Lucas.

Zombie's Halloween goes into detail of Michael as a child, while there is still something of a child left, and the hell on earth that exists in many households.  Michael Myers will become the manifestation of evil in society.  Halloween was reminiscent of David Cronenberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brood/dp/B00009PY2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brood</a>&nbsp;and how the mother's anger physically manifested itself as she spawned deformed children to seek out what angered her.  Unlike the mother in The Brood Michael doesn't lash out at society but becomes the evil in society and eventually will no longer be human.  True evil cannot be stopped with a gun or a knife and neither can Michael Myers.

My point is Zombie's film can be looked at as poetic and a message for non violence (you think I'm crazy).  Michael Myers is a metaphor for the evil in our society, specifically the evil that hides in the suburbs behind closed doors.  Myers uses a mask to hide this evil as suburbs could mask this with white picket fence as a happy front. If you can't use violence to stop this evil as we do in our society then you have to go to the roots, the family and family values.  Similarly the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Cups-of-Tea-One-Man-s-Mission-to-Promote-Peace-One-School-at-a-Time/dp/0143038257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time</a>&nbsp;which uses education to fight terror where it starts and not bombs.

There are two moments in the film where, Michael Myers, the boy fights that evil.  The first, after Michael has murdered his family and is locked away in an institution he has an emotional breakdown with Dr. Loomis at Christmas time.  Michael for an instant realizes the situation and is terrified this reminded me of Regan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-25th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/079073804X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;as the demon left her.  Flash to the next scene and Michael is gone and the evil has taken him.  The second moment after Michael has kidnapped Laurie he once again becomes human for a  moment, drops his knife, and shows his face to his sister, once Laurie stabs him and he puts the mask back on Michael is now dead and there is only evil.

Zombie has a stellar cast of horror veterans that there are too many to list.  Zombie does not use this as a gimmick or to wink at horror fans the film is taken seriously from beginning to end and their are solid performances all around.  Rob Zombie seems to get better with each film as does his wife Sheri Moon Zombie who gave a solid performance as Michael's mother.  The photograph that is shown at the end was very effective and tragic.

2944464,2,B000VKL6Z2,"What happens when you give a horror fanatic like Rob Zombie the liberty to do as he wishes on a horror franchise like John Carpenter's ""Halloween""? Unfortunately you get bored to death with one cliche ridden scene after another. What the hell happened? I didn't think his first two films were bad, not great, but not awful either. I figured the major problem here is the same deal you'll get from Tarantino or Rodriguez, they're film enthusiasts. They're better skilled at creating tributes to the films they love than adding any original ideas of their own. That being said the film isn't a complete remake. If you've seen the original ""Halloween"" you'll remember that it starts with Michael breaking out of the asylum. In the new revamp version Zombie, in the first act, gives us a glimpse of what Michael was like as a child and what led him to be locked away in an asylum in the first place. Oddly enough I think the first act (all the scenes that eventually lead into his killing spree) is excellent. I would have rather have seen a film about  a child growing up into the killer instead of just a simple explanation for the sake of exposition. Imagine what a riskier and much more controversial film that would have been! And what a way to reawaken the franchise which was originally hit or miss anyhow. Regardless, once Michael escapes the asylum we are treated to simple slasher film clichs with no rhyme or reason for half the killings. Were any of these people in his way in the first place? How does he know to find his sister? Basically he just goes on a killing spree for the sake of a killing spree and several times I found myself yawning and losing interest. Forget about tension because without that rhyme and reason you get none. I wanted to enjoy this film but it was a total let down.

2944466,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Anyone who has seen the original Halloween and the sub standard fodder that followed knows that this is possibly one of the best horror flicks made at the time. To step up and remake it takes someone with a passion for the original and the will to do it justice by making a film that pays homage and builds on it.

Zob Zombie stepped up to the challenge and has come out of it with an excellent version.

Using a well cast younger Michael Myers we see the degrading mental state of a child into the monster that was Michael Myers, but also right upto the end when we see him capture his sister there's a touching element to the love of a brother for that of his baby sister. There were so many extra segments generated into this new version that simply did it so much more justice, and in my view eclipsed the original.

The down side for me, and this is personal, I felt that Malcolm Macdowell was very poorly cast, he just wasn't up to the role originally filled by Donald Pleasance. He himself always appears to act with a complete contempt for the role, and never really makes you believe in him, okay maybe just my opinion a very small blip in an excellent film that fills the gaps the original left behind.

Lets just hope this is where Rob Zombie leaves it and doesn't feel the need to remake part two.....",1206921600,,1313,4.303643724696356
2944467,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie did a great job on Halloween. He made it his own movie. I had doubts when I first heard about this about a year ago. But as previews and news started popping up, I knew a masterpiece was soon to be born.

The best thing about Zombie's version is the fact that Michael has a backstory. We get to see Michael's life as a kid and his life in the sanitarium. Rob Zombie really made it feel so realistic and so fascinating.

Another great thing is that Michael isn't some in-destructable superhuman. He can actually die. In the original, and also many of the sequels, no matter what people do to him, he will not die. I think Rob Zombie's is the more realistic of the series.

So all the people who hate Rob Zombie's Halloween, I have one question.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU???

I saw an advanced screening of an amazing movie and definitely enjoyed it.
Rob Zombie's Halloween has great action and scares. You'll have a hell of a time!

2944468,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The Good Things
*Strong, vivid photography and style.
*Good acting.  Great portrayal of Michael Meyers; this film fully explores his genesis, and it is very brutal and gripping.  Malcom McDowell is interesting as the psychiatrist.
*Excellent sound and music design.
*Lots of bloody killings.  Horror fans should be satisfied.

The Bad Things
*Many of the girls in the film scream incessantly and act stupidly.  Sometimes, you want to yell at the screen ""What are you doing? Run!!"" Could also be a good thing, because it's suspenseful.
*None of the victims show as much strength as Jamie Lee Curis did in the original version.  The one surviving character shows this only in the very very last second.
*There is stronger brutality, more swearing, more sex, and more blood.  Fans of the older, classier version may not like this.

I really hated the original ""Holloween,"" so I believe this is a superior version.  Its style is not only modernized, but also downright scary and unsettling.  I am particuarly impressed by its portrayal of Michael Meyers; there is much more character depth to him, and they go into his back story much more deeply.  Instead of being an inhumane, unkillable, supernatural entity, he is a human monster, and that is perhaps much more frightening (and maybe more realistic).  There is more bad content (sex, violence, swearing), but I do not think it is entirely overwhelming.  Horror fans everywhere should at least look at this rendition, for it is quite intense.",1206230400,4,1491,4.987854251012146

2944471,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's interpretation of the John Carpenter classic horror film ""Halloween"" is a much crueler variation on the traditional story.  I found it to also be a tribute to horror fans.

The movie tells the story of Micheal Myers upbringing that planted the seeds of his homicidal mania.  It was quite moving, in my opinion, as the parents yelled and screamed at each other in front of their infant child.

In many ways, the movie was also a tribute to the slashers of the '80's.  I have never seen so many teens having sex and getting maimed for it since my '80's favorites, the Friday the 13th series.

The movie also had many horror acting favorites coming in for cameos, including original ""Dawns..."" Ken Foree, Rob Zombie fave Sid Haig, Sybil Danning, Danny Trejo as a sympathetic janitor, and several others... I really liked Malcolm McDowell's performance, as well as the grown up sister of Micheal.

Zombie also peppered the film with clips from classic horror movies, naturally Zombie's favorite genre.  I was also very happy they kept the traditional ""Halloween"" theme song.

The murder's are atrocious, the story is good, and ultimately, Zombie took the classic and made it his own.  And despite the fact that I agree that you shouldn't mess with a classic, they both tell a fine horror story.",1205625600,4,1303,4.802690582959642

This is what happens when people can't think of any new ideas. First try to copy and imitate the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with one movie... now do a remake of a classic and fail miserably.

What exactly does this have to do with the original?... This is Rob Zombie's warped version of a classic.

We have some twisted version of the 1970's with a family of Rednecks. Michael Myers is their child.  You can see the kids face- There is no mystery in this at all-  Then we have the same plot as the original with different things added. Then the story switches over to present day and the same old story except 10 times worse.  Here we have Malcolm McDowell as Doctor Loomis and the lady from E.T.... Even these good actors couldn't save this mess of a movie.

 The horror genre really needs to think up something new instead of recyling the same old movies and failing at it. You have the greats and then you have the copiers and imitators who end up trying to copy legends and failing everytime. This is another example of that.  I strongly recomend you do not see this-  it will disapoint you.

The dialogue is cheesy and lame as hell, Zombie isn't a literary god not even a little.

But I digress.

I have to admit that while I've watched Rob Zombie's other movies, none of them have been remarkable for me.  However, this remake of Halloween has certainly gotten my attention.

What I love about this remake is that there are background information added to the story.  For example, how Michael came to be this ""immortal"" serial killer.  Rob Zombie takes us back to Michael's childhood.  It seems that Michael has always been a bad seed, limiting his evil deeds with just mutilating animals.  The monster in him emerges when he reaches a breaking point with his classmates bullying him, his mother always working, the mother's boyfriend constantly picking on him, and his older sister neglecting him for her boyfriend.  Only his innocent baby sister escapes his rage.

Years later, we see Michael breaking out of an asylum.  What's freaky is that Michael is this huge guy, about 6'8"".  Michael makes those WWF guys look like sissies.  So, can you imagine facing a serial killer with that kind of build?  That's enough to scare the nine lives outta you.  (I know, I know...we're not cats.)

Anyways, if you've seen the original in regards to Michael's return to Haddonfield, you'll start to connect the missing pieces that Rob Zombie presents with what you can remember (from John Carpenter's film).

It's a interesting idea to bring back a classic to the big screen in this age. The only problem is if you can't make it just as good as the original then leave it alone.

The film way just way too much in the way of gore. I love how the original focused more on terror then tons of blood and guts, leaving the brutality more to the imagination then right in front of your eyes. Then there is Laurie. The way she was portrayed in this version was far from innocent and extremely annoying. I was actually hoping Myers would kill her to shut her up. The original made her so innocent which added to the terror. Then you have the ultra white trash Myers family which was yet another strike. The original showed michael coming from the typical middle class family which made it so much more effective. And what about Dr. Loomis? Thank God they didn't cast this guy as the original. Halloween just isn't the same without the real Loomis. The only thing that did make sense was the freakish size of myers. I mean he always seemed to have superhuman strength but looked like a normal size man. Here he was a monster. This would explain why he could crush someones head with his bare hands.

Overall I feel this remake just missed the mark in so many ways. I really did want to like it, but just couldn't find enough to do so. I felt it lacked any kind of horror. Just stick with the original.",1203292800,4,1518,4.304195804195804

It should also be noted that I have never really liked Rob Zombie's films. I respect his art style and direction but to me his films aren't that great or original what so ever. They are just Chainsaw rip-offs.

Im only 20 minutes in and I have to wonder why mess with the story so much? The original Carpenter masterpiece was flawless. So why change EVERYTHING??? When Michael killed his family in the original it was in 1963. Now Zombie has Michael running around with a KISS T shirt and listening to KISS. I love KISS don't get me wrong. But the band formed in the early 70's. Why change that? And why change the dynamic of Michaels parents? In the original you only see them in the scene after he killed his sister. His parents were clean cut people. Why take the father out of the picture all together and replace him with a drunken step-dad? Why turn mom into a stripper? To show how Mike got so screwed up? Thats all fine and dandy but even clean cut families have dysfunction. Why did Zombie have to change basically the WHOLE MOVIE??? Why even re-make Halloween at all???

Please listen to me. If you love the original you owe it to yourself NOT to watch this film. It takes what was great about the original and flushes it right down the toilet.",1203033600,4,1414,4.332075471698113

Lines like He had the blackest eyes,the eyes of the Devil,and Was that the boogeyman?Yes,I believe it was were what made the original work as a scary film. Rob Zombie made a mock docudrama very brilliantly and put a unrated graphic version with great explanations in his commentary as well as great interviews,and outstanding bloopers. If he'd remade it with the same extralarge actor and less background it would've been much scarier.

2944486,3,B000VKL6Z2,"This week we, Sid the Elf, decided to review the remake or whatever of the greatest horror film ever, Halloween. Now, we knew that this film was done by the ever-creepy Rob Zombie so we realized going in that things had a chance to get wierd or stupid but this one was ridiculous. It was a remake of the classic, kind of but not really. And the parts that were the same as the original were different here. Sounds confusing? Well how about watching this in an altered state trying to figure it out?

The bulk of the film concentrated on Michael Myers's early life and his rise to the top of the world of serial killing. The funniest parts of this movie came in the section where the evil stepdad was making fun of a young Myers calling him a freak and questioning his sexuality while Myers stands there taking it while wearing a homemade mask. It doesn't get much funnier than that. You also had young Myers making the ""I want to wrestle you so freaking bad"" face whenever anyone made him mad. Well, when he wasn't wearing one of his little masks. That was great. Also, young Myers offered us a couple of freakouts. The one when he went off on Loomis was awesome. If this movie was not a remake of a classic, and stood on its own, it would have made a pretty good horror B as all the elements were there. However, when you look at this film as the remake that it was, it fell way short.

First, Sid would like to talk to you about Loomis. In the original, he was the best part about the film. Who could forget such classic lines as, ""Tell your men to keep their eyes open and their mouths closed,"" along with many others. In the remake Loomis offered nothing, he had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. He even exploited Myers's psycosis by writing a book and going on a speaking tour over it. Then, there was Laurie. In the first film, she was sweet and innocent and you really did not want Myers to catch her. This was one of the things that made the original. In the new version, she was trashy and annoying. Sid was hoping they would change the ending and have Myers strangle her by the 30 minute mark. Finally, there was Myers. In this one, he was a giant goon, which does explain his freakish strength and adds a lot in the way of unintentional comedy. But, he was so goofy. Sid even joked that Kane was playing him, only to find out that it was actually a more b wrestler that we'd never even heard of! Big Sky is the guy's name for the record.

So, this film was ok at best. That's factoring in all the unintentional comedy by goofy Myers, young Myers, and the stepdad; and the um, comedic mood Sid was in. Apperances by Clint Howard and Danny Trejo helped ease the pain a little. Oh, and the few times the film featured ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" was a pretty cool nod to the original and to more cowbell. But, Zombie's version concentrated too much on the gore of Myers' killings and his disturbed past really trying to drive home the fact that this man is totally insane. Yeah, we kind of got that by the huge killing spree, but I guess when you're Rob Zombie that's not really enough to classify someone as off the reservation. This one is probably only worth checking out if you've never seen the original and want to settle in with a decent horror B or if you just want to make fun of fat young Myers for a little bit.

2944491,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I wanted to do the original Omen for my 666th review, but I have been wanting to watch this film for a long time. My review is for the unrated 3 disc set from Circuit City.

I went into this film with the mind set that this was a Halloween movie from a parallel universe. If you want to enjoy this film, try not think of it as a remake....OK?...alright, here we go.

This film is well produced and the first half deals with young Michael Myers at age 10. Although sort of interesting to watch, it really doesn't give us much more insight than the original on why he's so evil. Carpenter's film leaves  a lot to the imagination and we all know that what we conjure in our own minds is usually scarier than what we see on screen. This is a new Halloween and we get to see some brutal murders unlike the original. This isn't necessarily a bad a thing.....well,.... I usually don't complain (too much) about really stupid scenes in horror movies, but this film has some real bad ones! Michael is in the mental institution for brutal murders and yet he walks around unchained and is allowed to use forks and knives when he's eating! I guess so he can stab and kill a nurse who is left alone to watch him.

Unlike the original in which ""The Shape"" was actually a slender man and or supernatural being, this guy is huge and should have been restrained in a straight jacket 24/7! I only mention this because it appears Zombie is trying to make this character more ""human"". Well that requires making sense throughout the film. When a couple of ""boneheads"" who work in the hospital try to have their way with a new young female patient, what do they do?........ well, they bring her over to Michael Myer's room where the gigantic lunatic(who loves to kill people)sits making his disturbing masks and they rape her with their backs turned to Mr. Myers! Then, they antagonize and hit Mr. Myers as if he isn't a threat! It's scenes like these that keep this from being a much better movie.

I had no problem sitting through it's 2 hour time length, but I kept thinking how close Zombie came to making a good horror film. As it is,(at least the unrated version I saw), it's a 2 1/2 star horror film. Only in the last 25 minutes or so did it finally build some tension, something the original had in spades! The Michael Myers in this film does look menacing and the film has an upgraded slick look, so Zombie's heart was in the right place. Some things he got very wrong...Unlike the original, I didn't feel this film had anything to do with Halloween as it just seemed to be in the distant background of the film. Carpenter's version was all about Halloween. Also, making Myers a human nut job took a lot away from the unknown eerieness of the character in the original.

The unrated edition has a great transfer and lots of extra goodies. My version had a third disc with the cast at comic con doing a question and answers gig. Now that I have seen the theatrical version, I would have to recommend it over the unrated one, even with some slightly trimmed down gore, it's a way better movie and makes more sense! I give the theatrical version 3 1/2 stars!",1201392000,2,3142,4.390034364261169
2944492,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm going to try to be brief here.  The thing about this movie is...it's gritty.  They swear a lot, the teens are perverted, it's bloody and brutal.  But it's also realistic.  The camerawork makes the scenes look real, not extremely neat and tidy like in some recent movies.  It's all believable.  Also, the story is very absorbing.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the first time i watched it.

something i've read many complaints about is the fact that michael is now human.  Personally, i think a human that goes insane is far scarier than just a dude that can't die.  It shows michael as he travels down the dark road, becoming more unstable than before, but still seems to have some grasp on reality (a scene towards the end of the movie).  It also shows his family, which adds sort of an emotional level to the film.

Don't even bother watching the movie if you're going to compare it to John Carpenter's Halloween.  Rob Zombie's Halloween is completely different.  If you're not willing to watch the movie without analyzing everything about it, then don't bother.  You won't enjoy it.  Also, if you dislike shaky camera movements, don't watch it.

Now, for the unrated version vs the theatrical version.  I heard the Unrated flows a bit better, but there are 2 scenes in the unrated that are different from the theatrical.  1 being when he escapes, and the other being the ending.  I heard both scenes were better on the theatrical.  (better scene doesn't equal better flow though.)

One thing this movie is not, is corny.  Every other remake that has come out over the past few years has lacked substance that the original had.  Not at all the case with this movie. When I first saw it in theaters it didn't live up to my expectations because I just wanted to see Meyers suited up in action, doing his thing.  I originally thought the first half dragged as well. But it did give you a clear view to Michael's whole story.  It did a real well job in showing you a lot of things that were very vague in the original movie.  The Directors cut however, a few scenes changed making the movie more realistic.  When Michael returns to Haddonfield the movie just pops off.  Some nights I throw this movie in and just watch the second half because it is just so dope.  Michael is a straight beast in this movie.....he is in 100% prime form.  I never make my mind up based on other peoples reviews, but i just had to drop my two cents on this movie.  This is a very well-acted horror movie with a good understanding of the story.  The dialogue was also pretty funny as always coming from Zombie's team of actors.  By the way......Danielle Harris is fine as hell.",1201132800,,1341,4.24901185770751
2944495,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I have always been a fan of the Halloween films, especially the first one.  That may be part of the reason I was not really impressed by this film.  This movie made me feel ""dirty"" with all of the foul language (especially at the beginning) and the violence involving children.  I felt like this version dealt too much with Michael's childhood.  It really made the third act seem really rushed.  The third act is the section dealing with Michael's adulthood (the material covered in the original Halloween).

I caught myself looking at the timer on my dvd player several times while this movie was playing.  It ran way too long, again primarily because of the extensive time devoted to Michael's childhood.  It almost seemed like this should have been two films, as long as it was.

As for the good things, there were a few.  The new Laurie (who we don't even meet until about an hour into the film) is very good.  She seems much more believable than the Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  There were some scary scenes in the third act as well.

I don't think I would really recommend this movie to anyone except Rob Zombie fans.  I don't think the movie would appeal to general audiences, as few horror films do.  I also think many Halloween series fans will not really enjoy it all that much.  Honestly, I don't see it getting many repeat-viewings on my dvd player.",1201132800,,1368,4.545081967213115
2944496,1,B000VKL6Z2,"It seems that Rob Zombie's Halloween is a love-it-or-hate kind of thing.  Well, that places me firmly in the HATE IT category.  The main problem I have with the story is how much time is devoted to Michael Myers' troubled childhood.  So, little Mikey is picked on at school, he kills animals, and his homelife truly sucks.  So...are we supposed to feel sympathy when he becomes a raging psychopath?  I certainly didn't.

And, since this is a Rob Zombie film, you have to include virtually non-stop profanity, sickening violence and thoroughly loathesome characters.  Others have menioned that Myers' mother was the lone sympathetic character in the film.  And she's a stripper.  Not much sympathy there, either.

Look, I LIKE horror movies.  And I like the original Halloween and maybe about half of the sequels.  But this thing is just pitiful.  There's no suspense, no levity at all, just 2 hours of in-your-face filth and violence.  I can't imagine what anyone sees in this garbage.",1201046400,13,985,4.926829268292683

Zombie didn't really ""remake"" the original, he actually expanded the story and created a very different - but essentially the same - movie. He managed to create a movie that both respects the series and also has ""rob zombie"" written all over it. Couldn't expect more.

This movie deviates enough from the original for it to have been better being the source for a similar horror movie series not entailing Michael Mathers or the Halloween name- had I been seeing something foreign to the Halloween name but fashioned by the basic ideas in it I would have been more satisfied. Or possibly even a Halloween series movie but not about Micheal- rather about a different child who turns into a phsycopath. This movie also lacked any sort of suspense it was just a slasher- yawn. The original lacks the blood and gory available in todays films yet its still much more compelling and suspenseful. What I don't understand is why not continue with the Halloween movie series- if the characters of Micheal and Laurie are still alive why restart the whole thing?",1200614400,,957,4.505747126436781

Tyler Mane makes a great Michael Myers, with his large and intimidating stature.  I also like Malcom Mcdowell as Loomis and the scenes that focused on Michael's time in the institution.  This movie is of an acquired taste, I suppose.  It's Rob Zombie's artistic vision, and not everyone will like it.  Not everyone will think it's art, but those are the risks taken when making a film.

His next movie, Devil's Rejects, was a good movie that I would have watched all the way through but probably wouldn't have kept the movie for my personal collection. With Halloween, Rob has made a film that I would have wanted for my personal collection regardless of who directed it. Were as I kept the other two movies because I'm a Rob Zombie fan, I'm keeping my DVD of Halloween because I think it's a kick *ss movie. The story is completely different than the original movie and I like this story much better.

2944506,1,B000VKL6Z2,"""Reimagining,"" and ""reinventing"" are popular words these days. But the truth is, there seems to be a creative bankruptcy that has plagued Hollywood for the past ten years or so. Plenty of foolish horror remakes have come down the line recently (The Hitcher, When a Stranger Calls, The Fog, The Omen), but few of those even hold a candle to Rob Zombie's desecration of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, HALLOWEEN.

Made for literally next to nothing, and with a no-name cast (at the time), Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN created genuine suspense and terror through masterful direction. The atmosphere was thick, the compositions perfect, and the haunting soundtrack was right on the money. Carpenter's vision contained next to no blood and a very small body count. What makes the original HALLOWEEN so deliciously frightening is the anticipation of violence.

Most know the nuts and bolts of the tale. On Halloween night, a 6-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister (after she has sex with her boyfriend) and is sent to a mental institution. Fifteen years later he escapes and returns to his stomping grounds for another round of terror.

Writer/Director Rob Zombie establishes from the outset that his version needs more exposition than the original, and this is a stupendous error. This clich-ridden back story to serial killer Michael Myers is pathetic. Little Michael kills animals, gets picked on at school, and has a morbid fascination with masks. Dr. Samuel Loomis does his best to try and rehab the young boy, but it's to no avail. Michael is pure evil, but we know that going in. That Zombie populates the entire first half of the film with this nonsense is inexplicable.

The excessive first few reels make the second half a frustrating bore. Once Michael escapes from the hospital the film basically turns into a retread of the original, though it contains NO suspense, just a whole lot of spurting blood. Once the killing really begins the entire first half is canceled out almost immediately; we feel nothing. Worst of all, the hero of the original, Laurie Strode, is reduced to a supporting player. Since we don't even get to know her until the hour mark, how much can we care about her? (It must also be said that making Laurie Strode Michael's sister was never Carpenter's original intention. Michael was supposed to be pure evil  on a killing spree. Box office profits and a contractual sequel forced Carpenter to come up with that particular tie-in for part two and he has often said he never liked it. If one watches the original 1978 film, no mention of Laurie's relationship to Michael Meyers is even hinted at.)

With it's overlong prelude about Meyers childhood, what Zombie has ultimately done is turn Michael into the film's hero. The rest of the characters are so despicable that it's impossible to root for them (except for Danny Trejo as a janitor who befriends Michael in the institution). Zombie's trailer trash humor and all-around filth adds nothing and only serve to elicit a smirk or tiny sense of disgust in the viewer.

The sad fact is that this is an incompetent film no matter how you examine it. Just one more brand name rip-off in the name of a quick buck - and the complete debasement of a groundbreaking original. John Carpenter can rest easy. This version will never replace the amazing (and still very scary) 1978 masterpiece.",1200528000,24,3366,4.894736842105263
2944507,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I must have been watching a different movie from some of the other posters because this movie was not only boring but also rambling. Rob Zombie has this annoying trademark of doing everything but literaly forcing you to sympathize with the 'bad guys'. Between the generic and predictable back stories to the sappy music he plays around his antagonists. I LOVE the original Halloween and Halloween 2. As a matter of fact every Halloween movie but 3 was better, and SCARIER, than this movie. I would have loved it if Rob had just made another entry, an original one, in the series rather than trying to turn an already great movie into the generic troubled kid next door scenario. Most of Micheal Myers' mystique was NOT KNOWING what the hell was going on behind that mask. Knowing made me like him less and it made me see him as much less threatening. Two things I doubt Mr. Zombie was goinmg for. ALSO a few things that bothered me about the 're make'

Myers family seemed to be a middle class working family that didn't seem to stand out for any reason in the original. In the remake they are poor white trash. Even the houses fence and landscaping are much different.

They actualy show Micheal in Halloween 2 I think, Maybe 1, for a flash and hes not a long haired blonde kid.

How the hell, in Zombies version, did Micheal know Laurie was his sister? And whynot kill her when he was a child? She was 'innocent' I suppose...blech. Thats the problem with over explaining things. You cant explain some of the minute details and not others that actualy lend to the story.

So he pops out, or pops in, Loomis' eyes yet in the very next scene there is no blood and he can see? WTF.

Laurie Strode was not as big a pussy in the original and Zombie killing her parents in this version seemed very silly.

Rob Zombie, for the love of god please stop using the same cast in every movie. It may work for comedys but this is getting annoying.

Some of you will say this wasn't a remake at all but a retelling of the story in Rob Zombie world...I say whatever. I DO NOT recommend this movie at all for any reason. This is the first horror movie ever that has actualy BORED me and I have seen ALOT of horror movies.

The acting is stellar. Of special note is the young boy who plays the part of a young Michael. He is so believable and terrifying in his role that one forgets he is just acting. The themes of abuse and neglect in a violent childhood, eventually leading to sadistic, heartless violence are very disturbing and realistic. It is a real horror!

The only thing I will say that maybe redeems this film, but not really, is that there were honestly a few moments when Zombie's scenes eerily brought to life the original, like a spirit returning from the grave.....it was like I was there again, watching it for the first time...but the rest and especially the ending were so disappointing....

2944510,2,B000VKL6Z2,"This 2007 remake flick of HALLOWEEN by Rob Zombie wasn't that good and seemed like a bit of a waste and a rip off even though it had a lot more action, violence, and blood than the original John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece film of HALLOWEEN, plus it wasn't nearly as heart-pounding either, so this was a poor imitation and poor remake and/or resurrection and revision of HALLOWEEN and I don't recommend it anyone, because even though Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick included a human side of Michael Myers and how he became so deranged and psychotic from being bullied at school and coming from trashy family household, Zombie's 2007 HALLOWEEN film lacks style and goes too far with Michaels human side and childhood days, unlike John Carpenter's 1978 HALLOWEEN masterpiece.

For instance, Michael Myers didn't make the heavy breathing sounds like he made in John Carpenters 1978 version of HALLOWEEN and like Michael Myers did in Halloween II as well.

You also wouldn't see Michael Myers one second and then vanishing the next like you did in the original either and Michael Myers wasn't as sneaky either, but it's almost as if they tried to overcompensate by making Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick a lot gorier with a lot more nudity and cussing instead by making the sex, nudity and bloody scenes overkill in comparison to the original, plus Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN left no cliffhanger ending at the end of this HALLOWEEN flick either, unlike John Carpenters 1978 HALLOWEEN flick.

In addition to what sucked about this HALLOWEEN flick by Rob Zombie, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) was very rude, snotty, and annoying, but Lynda(P.J. Soles) in the original 1978 version of Halloween wasn't nearly as rude, obnoxious, or as annoying at all, which made the Lynda character in this 2007 version of Halloween a very annoying character, plus Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell) dies off from Michael Myers in this HALLOWEEN flick, but Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) survives in the original by John Carpenter along with all the other HALLOWEEN installments.

Additionally, in John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN flick, Lynda(P.J. Soles) was having a good time humping around with her boyfriend(Bob)at a babysitters houses in someone else's bed, but in this Zombie HALLOWEEN flick, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) and her boyfriend(Bob) sneak into the vacant dumpy Myers house to do hubba hubba with some blankets on the floor instead, except Lynda doesn't end up having a good time with her boyfriend and not enjoying the sex with Bob at all and ends up putting Bob down instead of praising him or appreciating him and showing us a lot more nudity on Lynda instead of having Lynda and Bob enjoying the intimacy, unlike how it went for Lynda and her boyfriend in the original, since Lynda complimented her boyfriend in the 1978 version after Lynda and Bob have their orgasm by Lynda saying ""Oh Fantastic"" after Bob finishes boning Lynda, since Lynda and Bob obviously enjoyed the lovemaking in the original, especially before they got killed by Michael Myers not to mention that the characters who have premarital sex in these kind of terror flicks always seem to die off, but the survivors always seem to be virgins like Laurie for instance.

In addition to what helped screw this HALLOWEEN remake up by Rob Zombie was in the original 1978 flick of HALOWEEN by John Carpenter; Michael Myers killed his older sister(Judith Myers) at age 6 and then escapes from the institution 15 years later at age 21 to return to his hometown(Haddonfield, Illinois) to kill his kid sister(Laurie Strode), but in Zombie's 2007 remake; Michael kills his big sister(Hannah Hall), his stepfather(Bill Forsythe), and sisters boyfriend at age 10 instead of 6 and returns to Haddonfield to kill less than 15 years later.

This HALLOWEEN version also didn't even show the credits to the cast, crew, and credits at the beginning of this flick either, unlike the original HALLOWEEN done by John Carpenter.

Something else I noticed about this movie is in the scene just before Lynda(Kristina Klebe) dies off was for some reason they had censored out Kristina Klebe's coochie in this DVD, but in the movies they had actually shown Kristina Klebe's whole Womanhood with the 3B's Breast, Bush, Butt when Kristina Klebe(Lynda)was shown in full frontal nudity just before being killed off by Michael Myers.

All the actors and characters in this movie also acted very amateurish with abnormal potty mouths and bad attitudes, plus I didn't even care or sympathize for the characters Laurie(Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda(Kris Klebe), or Annie(Danielle Harris) in this movie either since they all seemed hardly likeable and a lot more immature and airheaded than Laurie(Jamie-Lee Curtis), Lynda(PJ Soles), and Annie(Nancy Loomis)were in the original HALLOWEEN by John Carpenter, which I had liked and sympathized for in that version, unlike Zombie's version.

Therefore I had zero sympathy for Judith Myers and Judiths boyfriend when Michael killed them after Judiths boyfriend finishes seducing her since Judith was rude and slutty looking in this HALLOWEEN version especially after Judith flaked out on taking Michael trick-or-treating to go upstairs to have sex in her bedroom instead which would make me almost fired up enough to want to do something like that who bowed out on me just so they could get laid.

In addition to why I had zero sympathy for all the victims who died off in this HALLOWEEN flick; Michael Myers came from a dysfunctional trashy family household with no manners like the Bundys on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, but in the original HALLOWEEN flick by John Carpenter from 1978, Michael came from a clean, sweet, honest, & typical family household like on LEAVE IT TO BEAVER which is why I sympathized for Judith Myers & most of Michaels other victims in the original HALLOWEEN since Michael was a lot less prompted by his victims to kill as opposed to this version.

So I agree with anybody who disapproves of this 2007 horror film and I agree with anyone who thinks Zombie did a terrible job with this revision of HALLOWEEN along with the fact that I expected Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick to be much better, but it wasn't even close to being as great as I had expected and I agree with anyone who felt the same way about Zombie's version of HALLOWEEN as opposed to John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece of HALLOWEEN.

So you could say Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, and Danielle Harris all tarnished the characters of Laurie, Annie, and Lynda.

So save your money and don't buy this DVD, but if you choose to watch it, just rent the movie or borrow it from a friend and it's almost as if this terror flick was overrated too.

Therefore, this HALLOWEEN by Rob Zombie bites the big one and the HALLOWEEN flick by John Carpenter is still the very best to this very day and always will be.

Therefore, this flick would've been better off if it had been titled something like HALLOWEEN 9: THE BEGINNING just like they did with the PSYCHO saga installments with PSYCHO 4:THE BEGINNING which tells us more about the story and untold story on Norman Bates and how he was before he went haywire and killed his own mother and customers who'd stay at the Bates Motel, which was similar to what Zombie did in this version, but since Zombie had revised Carpenter's version of HALLOWEEN and it wasn't as good or as authentic, this HALLOWEEN flick faltered instead making it even better than the original, but I think this flick would've been a little more successful if this movie would've been made as HALLOWEEN 9: THE BEGINING or something like that, since the purpose of Zombie's Halloween flick was to show and explain the untold story about Michael Myers and how he became the way he did and that Michael Myers actually had a human side to him that actually even talked, just like there was more to Norman Bates than we all knew that was revealed in PSYCHO IV:THE BEGINNING.

So for anyone who can prefer Zombie's version to Carpenter's version is way beyond me and is quite baffling and I agree with anybody who says Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick is a rip off, a waste of time, or insult to the original.

By the way, I just got word that Rob Zombie will be having his sequel to this movie released this Summer and that H2 will be released on Friday August 28th in theatres everywhere, but from the previews I've seen on its theatrical trailer online, H2 looks pretty cheesy and will probably be even cheesier than Zombie's HALLOWEEN 1 flick and will probably bite at the box office.",1200268800,4,8507,4.888349514563107
2944511,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie does a great job, actually I am not a fan of his previous movies but I love the original version of this movie so I wanted to see what rob zombie did to it. I love what he did with micheal meyers as a child, it makes you feel a little sorry for him and you kind of root for him. The one bad thing about this is the actor who played sam loomis in rob zombie's halloween did not do a very good job, his dialogue did not feel natural too me, it seemed kind of cumbersome.",1200096000,2,479,3.8
2944512,3,B000VKL6Z2,"As you can see from the title of this review, I called it ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"", because no matter how much resemblances there are between Zombie's and Carpenter's vision, both films are drastically different.  In other words, John Carpenter's is still a better film.

I'm not sure exactly what to think of this film. As much as I love Michael Myers, I really didn't need any story on how he actually became the killer he was.  The beauty of the original is that there was no motive for what he is doing.  He was raised in a nice, quiet neighborhood with his loving family.  When he snaps then, it makes it all the more terrifying and the audience questions why he does things he does.

In this version, his family are a bunch of grungy, profanity-spewing pigs.  They are not loving or caring (except for the mother) and in a way, we sympathize with Michael as a child.  Plus, the lead up to the killings, which start his path towards violence forever, is filled with Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"" playing in the background as Michael thinks about his Mom stripping at a club (Is this Halloween?  Am I watching a different movie?).  Anyway, it seems like Michael just gets bored on Halloween night and kills his family members.  There's no mystery whatsoever.  He just picks up a knife because he has nothing better to do.

Rob Zombie does a good job of moving the story along at a brisk pace, but that's also his downfall.  As soon as we're introduced to Laurie and her friends, they are killed 10 minutes after. Actually, a lot of people are introduced and then killed two seconds later. In the original, time (a lot of time) was spent on the girls and even though you may have been bored because of it, you at least cared when they were killed. Not so much here.

There were a few high points though. The direction by Zombie was pretty good and managed to get some good scares out of me.  Yet, I wanted more suspense-filled moments (no more of these jump scares) like the original.  There needed to be more stalking of the victims and less killing.

In the acting department, props to Scout Taylor-Compton, who I thought actually did BETTER than Jamie Lee Curtis. I know people are going to hate on me for that, but I found her much more believable and wanted her to live. Malcolm McDowell did an adequate job as Loomis, but he's no Donald Pleasance.  Some of his lines felt very forced and unintentionally funny.  Tyler Mane did a great job as Michael in my opinion.  Too bad that we had to see him as a child as it lessened the image of him.  Regardless, he was a brute, menacing, and had a great aura about him.

Overall, it was a good horror movie. I just wish more time was devoted to the victims than the actual killer. It would have made for a much better (and scarier) ride.",1200096000,,2782,4.433070866141732
2944513,4,B000VKL6Z2,"............unfortunately it is a remake of an already perfect horror movie, or else this would have easily been 5 star's.

Let me first start off by saying I thought this remake was extremely unnecessary, and I'm not a big fan of remake's in general, but if a classic movie like Halloween is going to be remade (which is innevitable in this day and age) I'm glad it was done by Zombie, he did a great job. Anyone else would have tore this masterpiece apart. Everything that plagued his first two movie's is completely gone here. The acting is definitely a step up from his previous flick's, he ditched the hand-cam for a steady-cam for most of the scene's, and all the effect's are good old fashoined prosthetic's and fake blood. The backstory on Michael Myers is done really well, and Daeg Faerchs' (little Michaels') performance is very good considering his age. It was also fun idea to think what Myers might have been like as a little boy. For most of the movie it is all backstory, and it is a completely different film than the original Halloween. I'm really glad he didn't just do a shot-for-shot remake, it's a preqeal/remake-hybrid which make's it very interesting. As unnecessary as it was, I enjoyed watching it, and I thought it was the most enjoyable Halloween film since Halloween 2. Recommended.",1200009600,,1311,4.724890829694323

I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (Not the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans!

HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psyschopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time? You gotta watch the movie to find out! If you love horror, remakes, and Rob Zombie's work, you'll love HALLOWEEN!!!",1200009600,,2205,4.712435233160622

2944516,2,B000VKL6Z2,"When I bought the Director's Cut I expected to basically get the same amazing film I saw in the theater, with some added action and more backstory. What I ended up with instead is a major disappointment. The original scene in which Michael escapes (one of the best scenes of the theatrical version) is now preceded by a horrific and very graphic rape scene, and the escape itself has been changed. What was a very dramatic, violent and destructive event is much less so, having been watered down to be almost PG-13 worthy.

Where was Udo Kier? I remember seeing him in the theatrical version but unless I blinked and missed him he was completely absent from the Director's Cut. There are several missing pieces, including some of the footage from the scene toward the end of the film in which Michael chases Boo (Laurie) through the house.

The special features (deleted scenes, etc.) are really good - I wonder why they weren't added to the Director's Cut when some of them were already present in the original version of the film?

The performances were all strong, the directing was excellent, and it was interesting to see the alternate ending and other features, but overall the film has lost it's initial impact due to too much tinkering.

Potential buyers would be better off buying the other two-disc set (the theatrical version) than this cut.",1199836800,5,1352,4.764957264957265
2944517,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Anyone who thinks this is the worst Halloween movie obviously hasn't seen Halloween 4 through 8. This movie is brilliant. It perfectly captures what made the original great and at the same time does its own thing and brings it to another level while not taking anything away from the original. It's impossible to even say whether one is better than other because they both bring something unique to the table and it never overdoes it with gore. There is a certain charm left to the original of course but thats what so great about it because I can still watch that if I want to and get enjoyment out of it. They compliment eachother rather than cancel eachother out. Not only is it one of the most satisfying and well made remakes but its probably the best horror remake too. Easily the best Halloween since the misunderstood third one. Some people just don't get the genius of Rob Zombie and probably never will. People complain that they changed things. But seriously, if you're not going to do anything with the material there's no point in doing a remake at all. You can do a shot by shot remake like Psycho and see where that goes. I think the fact that this completely polarized fans says a lot about how unique and clever this film is. Zombie took it and had a ball with it and those of us that got that appreciated this reimagining and tribute to the original. Yeah, they gave a bit more character development to Michael Myers and backstory but he is the star of the show and it surprisingly added to the effect rather than take away from it even though you might expect otherwise. Not that it matters but the new Laurie is much better to look at. People were ready to hate this movie before it even came out. Its a bias and a sad one at that. But they are the ones who will miss out. Whine and complain that they revamped a pretty good classic but you know what, take it or leave it but the original isn't going anywhere.  Also, if you were underwhelmed when you saw it in the movies, try the new cut. Bottom line: make up your mind but form your opinion and don't develop a bias beforehand based on nothing (don't listen to others' preconceived notions either for that matter) and you just might enjoy yourself. All in all this is a refreshing dose of real horror after the last few Halloween movies and considering where the horror franchise in general has been going lately.",1199750400,3,2386,4.43507972665148

This was a pretty entertaining movie on its own but comparing it to the origional? I gotta go with John Carpenters version. It was just chilling. This movie was more a Rob Zombie 'Devils Rejects' kind of white trash exploitation movie.,1199750400,2,405,4.486486486486487
2944519,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding. Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!

The casting for HALLOWEEN is also pure genius.  While all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and do a convincing job, Malcolm McDowell is especially effective in his brooding and eccentric interpretation of Dr. Samuel Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode almost makes die-hard fans of the original forget that Jamie Lee Curtis originated the role.  In addition, Daeg Faerch is genuinely frightening as the young Michael Myers, and Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie is quite good--arguably one of her best performances to date--as the white-trash mother of young Michael.

The DVD set here contains the theatrical version of the film, and thankfully, the disc offers the film in widescreen (a full-screen version is also offered, but why someone would actually want to watch it butchered like that is unfathomable). An Unrated Director's Cut is also available on DVD, but beware--it is far from the same film. Containing more than the usual ""restored footage"" that had to be cut in order to receive an ""R"" rating by the MPAA, the Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on that DVD a much weaker flick.

Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but if you want to see the work of genius for which he earned that praise, purchase the theatrical release offered here and avoid the Unrated Director's Cut.",1199750400,5,2076,5.148367952522255
2944520,3,B000VKL6Z2,"When you make a remake of a movie it should come close to the original story.
For me it took to much of a left turn, it had no feel like the original Halloween.
It seems that people that make movies think movie goers like to listen to bad language, I thought that's what made the original Halloween unique is that there wasn't much bad language in it.
It's cool that ROB gave us a insight on how Michael became a serial killer, and the guy playing Michael is a giant.
This movie reminds me more of ""Friday the 13th"" or ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"".
Just to let you know now this movie has quite a few sex sense in it.
Don't!! start watching this movie thinking it's like the original Halloween.
I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!",1199664000,,728,4.170212765957447
2944521,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I was fairly excited to see this movie, I have always enjoyed the other Halloween movies in this series. The only suspicion I had was the fact Rob Zombie was the director, I was not much of a fan of his other work. That being said, this movie is just mediocre.  It isn't so bad; it isn't that good.

Whatever little character development attempted failed miserably. The story of Michael Myers is nothing unexpected. (In not ruining too much) He came from a chaotic family with less than amiable family members. That's all you really get from his family. Zombie spends a decent amount of time predicating  Myers' personality, which is to show he has none whatsoever (which is a little odd if you think about it, considering the situation he's already in). So you won't get much in regards to character essence.

And now to the best part--or in fact, not the best part at all: the killing scenes. It doesn't necessarily concern me if this is in the ""thriller"" or ""horror"" genre because this movie includes neither element. People dying doesn't make such a movie, lots of people die in Braveheart, yet that movie yields neither such class. Zombie must have really missed out here. Just because someone wears a mask whilst carnage is in the works doesn't make it scary. There are no jump-in-your-seat shocking killings. There are no killings which are that horrific. Like I said, every killing scene is predictable, because you know for a FACT Michael is already there. Know those feelings you got watching the Friday the 13th movies, where you just knew that person was going to die, and somehow doesn't because the killer wasn't actually there or her boyfriend jumps out instead? None of those either. V e r y  P r e d i c t a b l e.

Mediocre. Shallow. Predictable. These are the words I chose to describe this movie. But, if you have a night where you don't really have much to do and your friend was kind enough to have purchases this movie and wouldn't mind lending it to you, it's snowing outside and nobody in their right mind would think about going outside, you have a cup of coffee and a blanket, this movie is worth watching. Maybe just once...",1199664000,3,2152,4.562176165803109
2944522,2,B000VKL6Z2,"With the release of ""Halloween"" in 1978, director John Carpenter introduced audiences to one of cinema history's most classic villains, Michael Myers, and ushered in the era of the slasher film. Even though his film was not all that much of a slasher film, in fact it was more of a thriller, the many sequels, and countless other film series', which were spawned from it were much more in the vein of slashers. Skip forward to 2007, after 7 sequels, some good and some not so much, the `Halloween' film series seemed to have run its course, so it must have appeared to some in Hollywood that the only options left for this franchise were to, A) let it die (which would have been fine and should have happened after ""Halloween: H20""), B) continue making pointless sequel after sequel that would most likely wind up going straight to DVD shelves (case in point, the `Hellraiser' series), or C) remake/reimagine the franchise. Apparently option C seemed the most viable, as musician/director/writer Rob Zombie (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") was tapped to helm this new incarnation of Michael Myers with his remake of the original film, simply titled ""Halloween"".

""Halloween"" is partly a remake of the John Carpenter original film from 1978, but is also an origin story for Michael Myers (this time played by Tyler Mane), giving viewers some insight into what caused Michael to become the monster that he is. Michael Myers seemed like a fairly normal 10-year-old kid, but appearances can often be deceiving. Behind his seemingly innocent faade was a cold-blooded killer, he just hadn't manifested himself fully yet. Then one Halloween night, Michael suddenly unleashes his dark side and kills his stepfather, older sister and her boyfriend, leaving only his mother and younger sister, Laurie alive. After the grisly murders, Michael is locked away in a psychiatric hospital where he meets his longtime doctor Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), and begins to fall even further into the abyss of his murderous psychosis. Fast forward 15 years, and Michael suddenly decides it is time to escape the hospital that has served as his prison for so long, and return to the town where his rampage began and to finish what he started by killing his only remaining family member, his younger sister that he had spared all those years ago.

The choice of Rob Zombie as director/writer for the new film didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me. Sure, the franchise had kind of wandered into the typical slasher subgenre of horror films, but Zombie's brand of horror was much more extreme and gratuitous than anything contained within this film series. However, when the film was released and began receiving some praise for the reinterpretation of the original classic, I thought maybe Rob Zombie had managed to make a more mainstream, and better film instead of his demented crop of horror films that he'd been crafting over the last couple of years. So, when I rented the film I approached it openly, and had hopes that it would be a good film, that could possibly equal the original (which should always be the goal for any remake), and if nothing else give an interesting origin story to the character of Michael. Upon watching the film, I soon realized, after getting about 30 minutes into the movie, that this film though not a typical Rob Zombie movie, it did contain most of the familiar elements that he loves to include in his films, i.e. plenty of language, graphic nudity, disturbing images, and extreme violence. Basically, Rob was making a more toned down film than usual, but in the end it didn't really feel like it was all that much of a `Halloween' film, as it seemed to still fit more in line with Zombie's previous two disturbing pieces of cinema, than with the series it was supposedly paying homage to while trying to breathe new life into the character.

The story, as I stated earlier, is a mixture of origin tale and remake all rolled into one film. The first half of the film is devoted to the early years of Michael Myers, essentially expanding on the opening moments from the original movie. This portion of the movie was somewhat interesting because it was showcasing a different time in the life of this villain, and also giving some clues as to why he became this killer. But, this new origin seemed to contradict the opening of the original film, because here Michael's family is painted as broken and abusive, whereas in the original he appeared to have come from a loving home and he simply snapped one day. Having Michael come from such an abusive upbringing served as a way of explaining why he killed some members of his family, mainly the ones who mistreated him the most, but it also seemed like an attempt on Zombie's part to humanize Michael and to try to get the audience to feel some semblance of sympathy for the character. This is where I feel the movie made a big mistake; the film is about Michael Myers, one of the most dreaded villains in cinema, I for one do not want to be made to feel sorry for this character. Why should we as an audience be sympathetic to him, why not just show him as a kid who suddenly snapped, committed a horrible crime, and then show how he slipped further into psychosis while in the mental hospital. That is what I thought this movie was going to do, and to an extent it did, but it also seemed to go to great lengths to create sympathy, which should not have happened. Once Michael is committed to the institution the movie seems to gain momentum, and these are some of the most fascinating scenes in the movie, and I thought that Rob Zombie actually did a good job of showing the character's gradual descent into madness, and he also used this as an opportunity to explore why Michael always wears a mask, which was a surprising addition to the story.

The second half of the film, is basically a rehash of the original film with some changes made to certain events, but it is pretty much the first movie condensed into one hour. This portion of the movie works on some levels, I liked some of the changes that Rob made to the original film, but it was also nice to see that even after all these years some aspects of the original movie are just too good to change, and should just be redone similar to how they were before. However, as good as parts of this section of the movie was, they were overshadowed by Rob Zombie's penchant for blood, gore, and gratuitous nudity, all of which took away from not just this portion of the film, but the entire movie as well since all of these components were sprinkled throughout.

The actors in this film were all decent; those playing the various teenagers were average at best. Their performances for the most part were fairly by the book, and therefore their characters were pretty much forgettable, not a single one of them contained even an ounce of the screen presence of Jamie Lee Curtis. Her performance in the original film is part of what made that film so successful, she was so sweet and innocent, and Jamie played her so naturally that you couldn't help but invest in her as a character. But the ones here were pretty much standard horror film fare, no real standouts just a bunch of unknowns trying to make a break, but none of them deliver anything resembling a memorable performance. The highlight of the cast was Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, the role made famous by the late Donald Pleasance. Malcolm plays Loomis as a caring child psychologist who desperately wants to reach Michael in hopes of finding some good in him, and when he realizes that this can't happen it breaks his heart. So when Michael escapes, Loomis comes after him with such zeal that it seems borderline obsessive. McDowell is fun to watch as Dr. Loomis, and steals every scene that he is in, and convincingly takes the doctor from being a man who cares for this young boy as merely a patient to being a man obsessed with stopping this monster who he feels responsible for because of his failure to reach him. It was a new angle to view the character from and one that Malcolm did an exceptional job handling.

In the end, ""Halloween"" is a major letdown of a remake. It fails to even come close to capturing what made the original film so good, and I think a majority of the blame must be laid on the shoulders of the film's writer/director Rob Zombie. His talents as a screenwriter and director are average at best, definitely not worthy of big screen feature films, his films seem more at home in the Direct-to-DVD marketplace. Even if you are a fan of Rob Zombie's work in movies, I believe that even you fans have got to admit that his adaptation of ""Halloween"" is nowhere near good enough to hold a candle to John Carpenter's original classic that started it all.

""Halloween"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both containing graphic violence, language, nudity/sexuality, and gore.",1199404800,2,8921,4.656725888324873
2944523,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie has done a very good job in remaking one of horror's most classic films.  Seldom do remakes live up to the original, but this scary film comes very close and adds in some extras along the way.

Unlike the original Halloween, Zombie's version starts out with the entire Myers family.  Young Michael (Daeg Faerch) is constantly tormented by other children at school.  They make fun of his stripper mom Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) and his promiscuous sister. Deborah's slob of a boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe) spends his days lying on the couch and hurling insults at the rest of the family.  The only person that Michael is somewhat close to is his baby sister.

One day, the tormenting from the other children goes too far, and Michael snaps.  One child is killed, and Michael then kills his sister, her boyfriend, and Ronnie on Halloween night.  His mother finds him holding his baby sister on the steps outside the house.

Michael is put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to a mental hospital.  At the hospital, Michael is placed under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  At first, Dr. Loomis sees Michael as a troubled child who has no recollection of what he has done.  He longs to go home to be with his mother.  But, as time passes, Michael slips deeper and deeper into a shell.  He begins wearing masks constantly and soon, he snaps again.  More people are killed, Michael escapes, and he heads back to Haddonfield to claim his last victim; his young sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who was adopted after Michael's earlier killing spree.

The events after this point unfold pretty much the same as they did in John Carpenter's original Halloween.  There are some subtle differences but, for the most part, Zombie follows the original very closely until the end, which is very different from the original.

I am a big fan of Carpenter's Halloween movies, and I was anxious to see how this version compared to the earlier ones.  I was very impressed with Zombie's film.  What I liked most about this movie was the look into Michael Myers' early life and how he became the madman he turned out to be.  Unlike the beginning of Carpenter's film, where the viewer only sees Michael killing his sister, Zombie spends almost an hour of film time setting the stage for Michael's slide from a troubled child to maniacal killer.  He also makes the viewer feel somewhat sympathetic for Michael, due to his troubled upbringing by a mom who works as a stripper and a deadbeat boyfriend.

I recommend this movie very highly.  Rob Zombie has taken a classic horror film and reworked it in such a way as to make it almost better than the original.  I still prefer Carpenter's version over Zombie's, but this scary movie is definitely worth watching.",1199404800,4,2798,4.755186721991701

The language is way too constant, and the violence is needlessly graphic.
If John Carpenter really wanted his film re-made, he should've done it himself, or gotten any other director to do it, besides Rob Zombie, he doesn't have the slightest idea what he's doing and should continue writing music, and retire from directing.
I give this film 3 stars for two reasons: Malcolm McDowell and the explanation for what made Michael go nuts, this is rent-material only.",1199318400,2,603,4.98019801980198

Halloween is a classic - however, what made it a classic for so many of us was the fact that we had no connection with why Michael is the way he is. His family life appeared to be somewhat picture perfect and yet that sweet innocent looking little boy in a clown suit was to be a psychotic killer.

Enter Rob Zombie. Now the film is full of reasoning. His abusive stepfather, his stripper mother, being bullied at school and his connection with masks. The fear of the original comes from the 'unknown'.

I enjoy the horror genre, the blood, the chase, the violence and the scares. Why is Zombie so in tune with half naked women crawling along on all fours and being stabbed from behind? Lastly, 'cause I can bare no more to talk about this film....as my best friend says, ""What is with the Extreme Makeover Home Edition at the end?!"".

Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"", surely blows out of the water all the pointless sequels in between and has his own unique touches (including his usual southern countrified hellbent revenge types and period soundtrack music plus his over the top mind numbing hallucinatory violence)but unlike the original ""Halloween"", none of the characters are sympathetic and are close to stereotypes and the comedic elements seem out of place (though the suspense and entertainment don't cease) and though obviously intended as a tribute to the original in parts also seems to parody it, which taken by today's standards seems almost wholesome (a metaphor of small town America fighting an out of control menace) and Rob Zombie's take is a full frontal assault on the senses. I do find it interesting to examine the life of Michael Myers as a child and expand on that brief part in the original film though the idea of it as even close to a ""case study"" is ridiculous. Some people who have been through mental hospitals actually are not deranged killers. Some recover and some even write Amazon reviews (including yours truly). As Loomis would say ""that is a scary thought indeed"". In brief, a relatively sincere effort to remake a classic and certainly, light years above Gus Van Sant's remake of ""Psycho"" but not up to the standards of Rob Zombie's genre bending classics ""The Devils's Reject's"" and ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". Watch the original first and then this out of curiousity as it is filled with too many elements and goes in too many directions to make it quite a success.",1199232000,3,1781,4.8618421052631575
2944527,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This review is on the long side, but please just bare with me.

Halloween just might be the most controversial horror remake of all time; when it was announced as a remake with Rob Zombie directing a lot of people were for it and a lot of people were against it. While I wasn't happy Halloween was being remade I also looked forward to it. I feel the last couple of installments were rather weak. Even though I do enjoy 2-5, it's all been downhill after the classic original. Also being a fan of Rob Zombie got me interested.

The series though needed something to get back on track and I hoped this would be the movie to get things going. I know a lot of people were upset that the series wouldn't get closure now. But does it really matter? This series has so many loose ends to begin with. The unfairly bashed Halloween 3 has nothing to do with the previous 2 or anything afterwards so that will never be wrapped up. Halloween 4-6 were ignored come H20 and Resurrection. So no matter what this series would never get closure. And honestly after Halloween: Resurrection this franchise was in much need of a resurrection.

Adding a back-story is something that can be very tough to work and that is what really made me nervous and when I heard it was the first half of the movie I got even more nervous. This may be a remake, but let's face it most people will still see this as the 9th Halloween movie. The funny thing is I happen to think the first half was the strongest of the movie and I know a lot of people felt that way. Even those who hated the movie, a lot of the times say the first half was better. The backstory here is far, far better than the lame curse of thorn. The first half was an interesting character study of a very disturbed boy.

The screenplay by Rob Zombie was very uneven; most of his ideas play out well, but there are some cringe worthy moments. The first 10-minutes or so features some weak writing. But as a fan of this genre the writing is often the weakest part and none of the Halloween movies had great screenplays. Yes even the original; the script really wasn't all that great. The reason Halloween is the masterpiece it is, is simply because of the strong lead performances and Carpenter's directing and music. In Halloween 07 most of the poor dialogue is from Ronnie White played by the very cool William Forsythe. His dialogue is terrible and his performance is border-line of a parody. His character is entertaining, but the biggest flaw with the first half. But the good is any scene with Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and young Michael played by Daeg Faerch. Also the scenes withy young Michael and Deborah Myers played by Sheri Moon Zombie also works very well.

The Loomis and Michael scenes actually come out well, and it was quite interesting to see Loomis actually trying to reach Michael and help him. In the original we never see Loomis working with young Michael, which is fine. That wasn't the point of the original, but it is interesting seeing Loomis trying to reach Michael. I found their relationship the strongest part of Halloween 07. In the original as well as the sequels Loomis is out to stop Michael no matter what. Even if it means giving his own life; when Loomis first comes across Michael at the end in the original his first reaction was shoot to kill. In Halloween 07 Loomis though tries to reach Michael first and if that doesn't work than shoot to kill. The scenes with Loomis and Michael are well written and acted and play out very well overall. Daeg Faerch does an excellent job as young Michael.

Some people dislike the backstory, but it was for the most part well done some people disliked the fact Michael was given a motive. I don't think that was the case. Michael was a disturbed boy who was bound to snap sooner or later. His home life just made him snap sooner. But the things he does as a child and later as an adult isn't something people do unless they are very disturbed.

The first half actually works well despite some weak writing at times; the performances were mostly good with Sheri Moon Zombie being the stand-out; I do think Zombie has a slight problem writing for normal characters, but he does a great job with Deborah Myers. She was likeable and very sympathetic. I do think though the screenplay could have used a touch up in the first half, but Zombie keeps the pace moving at a solid pace and makes up for any shortcomings.

The problem with the 2nd half is basically 80-minutes of the original crammed into about an hour. The pacing is the biggest problem; characters are introduced for a scene or two and are killed off right away. There is very little getting to know them. There are moments where it does sort of become a rehash of the original, but it still works well. No doubt it's not as suspenseful and scary as the original, but Zombie's scenes do work well overall.

With Halloween, the problem of writing for normal characters is still there for Zombie. None of the characters were really all that likeable outside of maybe Ismael Cruz played by Danny Trejo. The Strode family was Rob's attempt at writing normal characters, but the problem is they come across as really weird. It's like those people who get older, but yet try and act like they are down with the youth they always seem weird. Pat Skipper does a good job as Mason Strode as does Dee Wallace as Cynthia. Both characters are likeable though, but just come across as a little weird. Their deaths though are very brutal and work really well.

Scout Taylor-Compton does an excellent job as Laurie Strode, but her character was just not fully developed, but than again the point of Halloween 07 was to focus more on Michael Myers. It was his story where as the original was Laurie's story. Scout gets some heat, but she was one of the bright spots of the movie. Some people say she wasn't likeable and was too mean to Tommy Doyal played by Skyler Gisondo. I have to disagree; the scenes with her and Tommy and than later with Lindsey played by Jenny Gregg Stewart are the strongest scenes in the 2nd half. She wasn't being mean to them they have brother/sister kind of relationship and it worked quite well. Zombie is getting better at writing for normal characters. His first two were all about the villains, and here the main focus is the villain, but he does do better with the normal characters, than he did in Corpses and Rejects. But The Devil's Rejects is still by far his best movie thus far.

By the time Laurie enters the movie there is about an hour left and there was no way all these characters plus Laurie could be fully developed without slowing down the pace. This Laurie isn't the repressed virgin Jamie Lee's Laurie was. Scout's Laurie was a nice girl with an edge to her. But her first scene was very weird and that shows Zombie needs more work on normal characters. By the time Laurie came into play developing her too much would have slowed the pace down a lot. And at this point you gotta keep moving forward. There was potential with the Laurie character, but despite not being fully developed I do think the character was likeable.

Some people complain about the lack of screen time for Lynda played by Kristina Klebe and Annie played by Danielle Harris making her big return to the Halloween series. If you go back and view the original Halloween, Lynda actually doesn't have a lot of screen time. Difference is her part is spread out more through the picture, where as here it's not. Though it does seem like Annie may have had less screen time than the original Annie did; both girls though play their roles well. They weren't all that likeable in general, but they both provide solid performances.

I think the writing for Laurie, Lynda and Annie was good and bad. They do come across like teenagers in the things they say and do. Not all teens are like that, but a lot of them are. But they just lacked depth. But as much as I love the original there was some weak writing and Lynda had the weakest of lines. Lynda in the remake is no more developed, but in some ways she actually is. Prior to her death when she talks to Laurie on the phone does add a little bit of depth to Lynda. Her tough girl act is just that an act. Zombie's screenplay was very mixed, but there is some potential there for him as a writer with normal characters.

Tyler Mane I thought did a great job as Michael Myers. To be honest I would rate him 2nd to only Nick Castle of the original. If the original Michael was the incarnation of evil, this Michael is the incarnation of rage. Despite his size he's still stealthy. The scene when he stands behind Lindsey Wallace as she watches TV is a very creepy moment. Tyler's Michael and Nick Castle's Michael are very much a like, but very different. But I really loved Tyler's performance.

The good and bad of the backstory is simple. We get to know Michael so well it does sort of take away the boogeyman element. But it also brings a human side to Michael and makes him feel so much more real. I'll admit the 2nd half had some creepy moments thanks to Tyler's movements and the fact we knew Michael more makes him seem real. In the sequels he became too much of an un-killable monster. Like the original, this is the most human Michael has ever been. In the original Michael was just pure evil, he was the shape of evil in a man. But he felt like a real person. And while he kept coming back an excuse can be made for why he survived what he did. Zombie goes back to that in a sense. Again this is the most human Michael has been in a while.

What I liked about Tyler Mane was his eyes show nothing. And what I mean by that they show no remorse. He has this empty look. The person inside of him is dead and just evil has taken over his body. Having such a big Michael may not have been the smartest move, but it works out great as Tyler Mane gives it his all and makes a great Michael. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Dr. Loomis, though nobody can ever top Pleasence. My only problem with McDowell is sometimes he comes across as a bit shady. The major problem is a lot of his scenes in the 2nd half with Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is a rehash of the original just worded slightly different.

Some people complain about the violence, but I thought it was done in a great way. The one thing Rob Zombie really has going for him as a filmmaker is he knows how to shoot a brutal death scene. His love of exploitation cinema serves him well with the deaths. The victims try and fight back and put more of a struggle up. The scene with Michael dragging away a topless Annie is a very creepy moment. And when Laurie finds her later on it's actually quite chilling. This is probably the most violent Halloween, but it does work well since it's very raw and real. As a director despite some pacing problems Rob Zombie is able to keep things moving forward and like him or not there was a story and I personally enjoyed it.

Not everybody will like this flick, but I can't help but feel a lot of the hate stems from it being a remake. I saw a lot of negative reviews from people who never even have seen this and I read a lot of negative stuff before the movie was even shot. Liking the remake doesn't make you any less of a fan of the original and Halloween 07 will never replace the original. I don't get that so many people are willing to accept the sequels, but dismiss the remake before even viewing it.

Make no mistake Halloween 07 isn't a perfect film and not as good as the original. But it does deliver some suspense and scares. I would rate Halloween 07 as the 2nd best of the series only behind the original. I didn't like Halloween 07 at first, but now I've come to love it. Give it a chance and just forget it's a remake and enjoy the ride.",1199232000,3,11788,4.3818015546410605
2944528,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I did like how Rob Zombie made this remake very different from the original 1978 masterpiece of horror. Most horror film remakes today are the exact same film with bigger production values and zero horror. At least Rob made something totally fresh, though it has many flaws. I liked Michael Myers much better when I knew nothing about him. Now he is given a more realistic abused past and thus makes him human. Big mistake. The acting is decent enough for a horror film, but even the original wasn't the best acted film, so I can't really knock this one too much in that department. I think this is the third best film in the Halloween series after Halloween and Halloween II. Hallween 4 was okay, but all the rest aren't worth watching.",1199232000,3,737,4.548872180451128

2944531,4,B000VKL6Z2,"While not perfect, Rob Zombie's take on 'Halloween' is unquestionably the most enjoyable entry in the long-running series since the 1978 original. That's probably because it pretty much is the original, with a few new twists, and a backstory which offers a look at the childhood of Michael Myers. As is the norm with a Rob Zombie film, it's also very gory and violent at times, but not when you compare it to his other directorial efforts, 'House Of 1,000 Corpses' and 'The Devil's Rejects'.

Zombie's best decision in this ""re-imagining"" is to make Michael Myers vicious again. In too many of the inferior previous sequels, Myers is more like Frankenstein's monster, moving in slow motion. Here, he's far more energetic, and in one climactic scene, even runs at his intended victim. Tyler Mane, a former professional wrestler who played Sabretooth in the first 'X-Men' film, brings a physical presence in the role of Michael Myers; he's a towering menace. Zombie also uses most of his cast from his other two films, though the scene in the theatrical version in which most of them appear has been cut from this unrated version. Also, big kudos to Zombie for bringing Danielle Harris back into the fold, as she was the little girl in the fourth and fifth 'Halloween' sequels. She's all grown up now, and probably closer to 30 than the 18 year old she plays in the film, but she does just fine with the screen time she has. Finally, Scout Taylor-Compton has the daunting task of playing Laurie Strode, the role which made Jamie Lee Curtis famous all the way back in 1978. Taylor-Compton certainly is cute, but she can't quite pull off as convincing a performance on the same level as Curtis. Not that it's bad, but it's just not as memorable. Same goes for Malcolm McDowell, who steps into the big shoes of the late Donald Pleasence as Dr. Samuel Loomis.

Nonetheless, this film is surprisingly much more fun than any prior installment, with the exception of the original. Actually, some of this film is an improvement on the classic 'Halloween', because Zombie is generally faithful to the source material, right down to the characters' names. Even the famous score by John Carpenter is well reproduced by Tyler Bates. This is Zombie's best effort so far, and while the conclusion of this 'Halloween' seems to indicate that it's the final go-round for Michael Myers, I'd be happy to have Zombie do another sequel, if he wanted to.

Recommended, but be warned, some of the violence is brutal in this unrated version; opt for the theatrical version otherwise.",1198972800,4,2557,4.806818181818182
2944532,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I went into this movie with doubts-never a good sign -but the movie had some luck going for it because I was told by a few people how bad it is and this is usually the opposite kiss of death reaction -you know the one where someone tells you ""you'll love this movie"" right then you know you never will--turns out  that the people who told me it was awful have steered me wrong in the past.. sometimes enough to ask them ""what the hell where you on when you saw this movie? Because you clearly saw a different movie than I did.."" so I usually take that as good sign omen, what have you..
Now Ol' Rob has made only 2 other movies before he ventured into re-make  world. .and they were both sort of maverick originals. House of  1000 Corpses he pulled out all the stops and used every influence from 70's horror Texas Chainsaw Massacre( you know,, the good one),Hills Have Eyes, Deranged, aww hell all of them... and then he stepped back just a tad with the Devil's Rejects ..using the same characters but about halfway thru that movie something happened to its style and idea, and it changed , took a turn for the worst and had me wanting to leave the theatre
So as one can see it was not easy for me to wrap my brain around any UN preconceived notions about Rob Zombie's Halloween so I went in expecting perhaps an excruciating time  and guess what? I kinda liked it.
Now it goes ahead and takes a buncha artistic license like having the first half be the ""how Micheal Myers got that way "" saga but William Forsythe RULES and he didn't disappoint as the abusive drunken white trash step dad.. and Rob's wife Sherri Moon was surprisingly cool as the burdened stripper mom.. I know it won't sound like it but it was a stretch from her 2 previous ultra psycho-bitch-kitty roles. And the pudgy scary kid with the long hair as the young  fat kid Micheal was creepy. .but let's just note here that you cannot I repeat CANNOT beat some one to death with a tree branch sorry... and then there's Malcolm Mcdowell taking over the Donald Pleasance role...leaving me to once again say to myself what the hell happened to Malcolm Mcdowell? I mean there was time when he s ummmm GOOD! Well he wasn't so bad in  this anyone who watches the original again will notice that the dr.  Samuel Loomis role doesn't do much  the entire movie except stand around in wind bristled trees ..
Ok so the violence was good, gore was good, the fun part of seeing all kinds of character actors popping up including Mickey Dolenz-yes the one from the Monkees and the entire Zombie repertory theatre company of Sid Haig, Bill Mosely, Danny Trejo,Tom Towles,et all I really liked spotting Richard Lynch, Clint Howard,(Ron's bro) the gratuitous Udo Kier,and even the always excellent ""no matter what piece of crap I am in these days "" Brad Dourif as the sheriff
The second half of the movie stays pretty true to the original but it also has to be done in half the time so--when things look like they might plod..??? another brutal killing and brutal they are.. way into the bludgeoning factor in this one...but the ol' knife slashing complete with the new chunk and drip noise that accompanies all good horror blood lettings theses days is  no slouch either-- all the hot teenage babysitting chicks and their dialogue was I bet you word for to the original just not as much and that is a good thing because a lot of the jibber jabber in the first one is just filler because you know the psycho killer is out there SOMEWHERE in his William Shatner mask ready to strike.. I think that Rob tried to stay pretty faithful but with the high-tech of todays movies a slow story like this does need a bit more action not just extra violence and just like with a good cover song its better to take the original idea and bend it to your own creative interpretation and Zombie's case he shoulda twisted it all over the place and made it more of the psychedelic messes he is so fond of.",1198886400,2,3936,4.410468319559229
2944533,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I found this remake of John Carpenters classic to be one of the best films of the year. It was both revelutionary with its inclusion of Michael Myers back story, a more intimidating physical presence from the Myers character and finally he is no longer an invicible killing machine of the Vorhee's/Crougar variety but a much more terrifying 'human being' who happens to be both psychotic and immensely strong. I was also elated to find the original story intact and much more importantly the original score. BEST SCORE EVER!",1198886400,,524,4.898876404494382
2944534,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I thought Rob's take on Halloween and Michael Myers was excellent. The first half of the film was the most interesting part, as it describes Michaels background, his hellish family, and what eventually triggered his killing spree. It doesn't explain *why* he did it and it doesn't treat him with any particular symphaty. It's just a cold and raw description of his upbringing, much more realistic and gruesome than anything from Carpenter's original film. Michael ends up in a cell, he breaks out, and after that, it's unfortunately pretty much business as usual for a Halloween film.

I say unfortunately, because the film works best when Rob follows his own vision and I thought it was annoying when he tried to keep the Halloween traditionalists happy by including the Captain Kirk mask, the jump suit, the corny ""sheet over the head"" gag, etc. The first half of the film is so realistic that these pointless silly details ruin the overall impression and atmosphere. There's no real reason for Michael to put on the Captain Kirk mask or the jump suit, other than that the fans demands it. Michael does his own masks, as shown by the chilling scene from his cell, where the walls are covered with them. And Michael would *never* waste time by putting a sheet over his head, when there's killing to be done.

These leftovers from the original film should have been canned, even if it would have made the fans angry, because let's face it, the hardcore fans were *always* going to hate this, no matter how good it was.",1198886400,2,1518,4.724528301886792
2944535,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The original ""Halloween"" from 1978 was a great horror flick, a classic that hasn't been topped by any of the numerous sequels and clones that have followed. So what is there to do besides making another pointless sequel? Do a remake. And that's exactly what writer/director Rob Zombie did by redoing a new take on the horror classic. This time around Zombie decided to go back to the series' roots by showing new stuff that wasn't featured in the original. For example, we saw Michael Myers as a child killing his older sister in the first five minutes of the original film. At the beginning of this new movie, this time we see more of Michael as a child and how he slowly begins to turn to the dark side as he begins his killing spree on Halloween. The midway point of the film shows more scenes of Michael at the mental sanitarium, which of course he eventually breaks out of. And the last half features Michael heading back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois.

I haven't seen Rob Zombie's two previous movies (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") so going into this new ""Halloween"" movie I had no idea what kind of films this guy made. And judging by the opening scenes, I thought I was going to hate this film. We're not only introduced to Michael Myers as a kid, but we're also introduced to his family, and a happy family it ain't. The other members of the Myers household are Michael's mother Deborah, who works as a stripper; Michael's sister Judith, who's a sex-obsessed slut; and Michael's mother's boyfriend Ronnie, who's an abusive jerk. Oh and I almost forgot, there's Michael's baby sister, who will grow up to be Laurie Strode. These beginning scenes are so downright ugly that I found myself laughing at what was going on. This is true of that kitchen scene where Deborah and Ronnie are arguing and Ronnie loud angry tone causes Michael's baby sister to start crying not once, not twice, but three times! But then a funny thing happened while I was watching. The movie started to get interesting and I found myself more involved with the backstory of Michael Myers. The first half of the movie works best because it's the part that we hadn't really seen before in the earlier ""Halloween"" films, while the second half is more familiar territory as Michael (after breaking out of the sanitarium) returns to Haddonfield to claim his sister who's now grown up, and will kill anyone who gets in his way.

I was very surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did. It's one of the better horror movie remakes to come out of Hollywood recently, and there have been a lot of horror movie remakes. In the past couple of years we have seen remakes to hit horror movies from the '70s and '80s such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Fog"", ""When a Stranger Calls"", and ""The Hills Have Eyes"". And I'm sure there will be more remakes to come (""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" will probably be next). In my opinion, the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake from 2004 is still the best of all of these films. The ""Halloween"" remake from this year follows in second place. Sure Rob Zombie has made a movie that some people will probably describe as trashy. It's graphically violent, very profane, and contains a lot of sexuality/nudity. It's far more violent, profane, and sexual than the original John Carpenter film. But Zombie directs the film with a unique blend of stylishness that I found to be interesting. Plus, he gets some good performances from his cast of actors.

There are four performances here that stand out. Malcolm McDowell takes over the role of Dr. Sam Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence in the earlier films), and plays the character differently this time out. In the other ""Halloween"" films, there were times it seemed that the Dr. Loomis character was crazier than Michael Myers (that was especially true in the awful fifth movie). But McDowell plays Dr. Loomis as someone who doesn't act crazy. He's pretty sane, and wants nothing more that to stop the terror that's happening around him. His performance here is pretty good. The best performances are turned in by Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob Zombie's wife in real life) as Michael's mother, and young Daeg Faerch as the 10 year old Michael Myers. I found myself actually caring for these two individuals, and their relationship was very touching despite the evil that lurks around them. And newcomer Scout Taylor-Compton is very good as the new Laurie Strode. She might not top Jamie Lee Curtis, but she's still very effective in the role here. This time out Laurie isn't as uptight as she was in the original. She has some spunk, and I thought that was refreshing. Plus there's some good work done by Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" movies) as Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett, Danielle Harris (who played Jamie Lloyd in ""Halloween 4"" and ""Halloween 5"") as Laurie's friend Annie, who's also the sheriff's daughter, and Dee Wallace (the mother from ""E.T."" and ""Cujo"") as Laurie's adoptive mother Cynthia.

I did have a few quibbles with this film. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters earlier this year, and after seeing the unrated version on DVD noticed a few differences. For example, the scene where Michael breaks out of the sanitarium is completely different in the unrated version than it was in the theatrical version. Surprisingly, that alternate scene that played in the theatrical version isn't even featured in the DVD extras of this movie. And to tell you the truth, I was a little disappointed by that because I thought the breakout scene that was featured in the theatrical version was better and more effective. The new scene that's featured in the unrated version has a rape sequence that is quite nasty, and I'm guessing Zombie changed it for the theatrical version because if he had put in that scene for the theatrical version, the movie would have gotten an NC-17 rating. I wish Zombie had left that breakout scene the way it was in the theatrical version.

Nevertheless, the 2007 remake of ""Halloween"" is still a pretty good one. And the DVD extras are excellent. The bloopers are hilarious, there are plenty of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, casting sessions for many of the young actors who appear in the film, and a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie (which appears in different parts). All-in-all a decent remake.",1198886400,2,6444,4.709219858156028
2944536,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm sad to report that I'm disappointed in this version of the film. Among other things, the scene in which Michael escapes is completely different from the theatrical version and now contains what feels like brutality for the sake of brutality -- considering the fact that I don't feel this way about any of the scenes in Zombie's previous films, that's saying a lot. It truly pains me to say these things about one of my favorite directors.

I honestly liked the fact that you did not go into Michael's childhood. Thats what made him mysterious. We saw enough in the original to know he was not white trash so I did not get that. This movie spent to much time on his childhood for my taste. To many sex scenes and I don't dig rape scenes. I don't even understand the point of adding that into the movie. Also such bad acting. People seem to forget that the original was an Indie movie with no high priced actors or props just great scenes that scared you until the end.

2944540,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I must have watched this film about three times for no other reason then to decide if I liked it or not.  I was really that on the fence about it.  Final verdict is in and I feel that, although this is admittedly Zombie's best work and there is several kudos to be handed out; ultimately, the film fails.

'Halloween' can really be split pretty evenly into two halves.  The first of which is a brand new origin-story for Myers.  Granted, it's a little clichd and basically the same white-trash Olympics that Zombie seems to be fixated on.  At the same time though, it's really not bad and I bought into it.  The real standout here is Zombie's real-life wife (Sherri-Moon Zombie) who does a FANTASTIC job of portraying the tragedy of a mother who just can't seem to piece her life back together after Michael snaps.

I liked Malcolm McDowell here quite a bit as well.  I've read some pretty heavy criticism of the way he approached the 'Loomis' character, however, I like his approach a little better then (God forgive me for saying this) Donald Pleasance's take.  I always saw Pleasance's 'Loomis' as just some nut that shows up screaming ""He's evil!"" while shooting a couple of rounds in the air.

The real problem is, it's the very existence of this back-story that ultimately betrays the original concept of Myers in the first place.  In the original, and in most of John Carpenter's early films, Carpenter seemed to have a general understanding that nothing was scarier then the fear of the unknown.  In the original 'Halloween' Myers was an unseen terror lurking in the shadows, stalking his victims and biding his time until he decided to strike.  He didn't show even a HINT of emotion or humanity.  Until the audience caught a glimpse of him with his mask off, most people probably weren't even sure he was human.  We didn't know WHAT the motivation was for his rampage.  It was as if ""death itself descended on Haddonfield.""

By explaining too much, in my opinion, Zombie ultimately betrays that concept and demystified what made Michael Myers so cool in the first place.  If you'd made the first half about ANYONE other then the Michael Myers character, it would have worked and been a hundred times better.

I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.

If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.

While I'm willing to admit that it was a good swing; regrettably in the end, it just doesn't work.",1198800000,,3359,4.6440677966101696

I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.

If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.

While I'm willing to admit that it was a good swing; regrettably in the end, it doesn't work.",1198800000,,3354,4.645161290322581
2944542,1,B000VKL6Z2,"The Halloween series adds one more piece of trash to the tired franchise. Sadly, it made lots of money and will return again soon. What the producers are doing with this movie series is like a pimp that continues to drag his tired old prostitute to the curb and demand she make a dime. And like in real life only shallow, low-brow, easily amused individuals step up and pay their hard earned money and then ask for more. What keeps them coming back is knowing that at one time this tired old hooker actually looked good and delivered a quality service. I believe the original Halloween is one of the best movies ever made and I didn't think for a moment that this one would come close to being that good. However, I expected more than this scare-free, vulgar talking at every turn (seriously - who talks like that 24/7?), nude obsessed junk. When will we get back to suspense? What's scary about seeing a guy slowly creeping towards his victims from two miles away. What happened to the stalker jumping out - unexpectedly. Anyway, at least we can say it was better than Halloween Resurrection (another tired old whore).",1198713600,5,1119,4.6
2944543,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I finally watched Rob Zombie's ""remake"" of Halloween.  It wasn't completely horrible and I didn't feel like I wasted 2 hours, however, I have no desire for any repeat viewings.  For me, this just didn't feel like ""Halloween"" at all.  It completely lacked the two major factors (at least for me) that made the original ""Halloween"" work...and even the second one to some degree.  The two factors are suspense and atmosphere.  Zombie's version could really have been about any generic psycho at really any time of the year.

Main problems:
1. No real scares or sense of real menace.
2. I more or less disliked the Haddonfield actors (Strode & her friends).
3. Myers has too much screen time overall.
4. Too many Myers-in-the-daylight scenes.
5. Too much of a ""white trash"" background to Myers.

I understand what Zombie was trying to do, but for me it didn't work very well at all.  He should stick to developing his own original ideas into film.  I'm glad I Netflixed this instead of buying it outright.",1198713600,,1001,4.706896551724138
2944544,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I was pretty excited about the remake...I am a huge fan of the origional. Rob Zombie ruined Mike Meyers story. The Meyers were not white trash, they were a regular middle class family. That's what made it scary! Mike was just the boy next door. Rob Zombie just sucks...I can't believe that any real fan would destroy the orgional vision the way he did.",1198713600,9,352,4.515625
2944545,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I'll start off by saying that I got this on Christmas. I was glad that I got it but when I seen other peoples reviews and said there was a nice escape scene in the other version, I wished my dad got me the other one. Well this movie was very interesting. I liked how Zombie reflected about half of the movie on Myers childhood. I don't know if his family was really like that because it felt like he added his own sickest style to it. In the original the Myers family looked like middle or upper class people with a very nice house. When you look at this you see that the mom is a stripper and his step dad looks like a drunk with a very poor house. There was a lot of nudity in this movie to. There was some unnecessary scenes and that including one thing that made this movie go towards a sick and nasty Rob Zombie movie. There was a rape scene in this movie that felt really dumb and corny and I wished they would have just kept the escape scene. I haven't seen the escape scene but I can tell it was good by the reviews. I new the cast looked very familiar because they have been in every one of Robs movies. I thought the mask was very stylish and I think John should of done that. I wished it could have been a lot more violent because of the unrated version. It just looked like they wanted to focus on nudity and sex. Plus the ending felt very stale and I felt like I got dupped. The extras on the second disk was okay. The bloopers were very funny and it felt like they didn't take it very serious and it also felt you didn't watch a horror movie.

OveraLL this was okay but Im going to see if I can find the escape scene online so I can feel better about this ""horror"" movie.",1198713600,2,1685,4.0148809523809526
2944546,1,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I am such a big fan of the original version, but this one made me want to cry.

When I think of Halloween, there are many things that should have been incorporated into the movie. First, the scene where Micheal wears a sheet and glasses (which he does in this movie). Everything else was missing. There sould have been a scene where Laurie was in the closet and Micheal tried to get her. One other important thing is only being able to see his mask, as if it were floating in mid air. No scenes like this. Instead, they make him to be more like Jason from Friday the 13th. I love the Friday the 13th franchise, but his is Halloween. Micheal lurks in the shadows and surprises his victims, he does not use brute strength to tear through everything to get to the victim. I enjoyed the backstory idea, but I didn't like how they made his family trailer trash.

I really liked the young girl who played Laurie Strode. I am really happy that Rob Zombie did not make her like she was in the original version. In all honesty, there is no 17 year old girls like that in 2007. I am glad he made her spunky instead of Amish.
I also really liked how the mask was all aged and dilapidated. These were the only two good parts of the movie.

One things that really bothers me is that I felt like I was back in freaking 1972 throughout the entire movie. Every single male character had long hair. I thought they were all in a bad 1970 rock band. I understand that the movie probably starts out in the 80's, so the long hair would be expected. But when it is in present day, come on. Every single movie that Zombie makes is like a freaking music video because all the guys are like rock stars with long hair. THIS IS 2007.

Another things that bugs me is, yet again, this movie has the same cast from House 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. I honestly have not seen another movie with these actors in it, and there is probably a good reason for that: THEY CAN'T ACT. The exception is Sherri-Moon Zombie. I actually really liked her in this movie. But the rest, come on. They are freaking Z-List celebrities.

And lastly, I do not consider this a horror movie. I consider this a porn movie with Micheal Myers as a side character. Every five minutes there is a sex scene with naked women running around. It was so gross. Even the scene when Micheal escapes the sanitarium is because of a gross sex scene. (which I don't understand why the two men wish to do what they did to the poor woman in Micheal's room. This was a very weak scene.) Almost all of the main characters that die in this movie die right after or during having sex. The sex scenes overshadow the gore scenes. I mean, Micheal will be in the middle of killing someone, and suddenly it skips to a sex scene. When we come back, there is blood EVERYWHERE, and we don't get to see how this happened. I would much rather see the blood shed, and less porn. I mean, if I wanted to see a porn movie, I would rent one.

This movie was complete and utter trash. I really want everyone to watch the original Halloween instead of this stupid movie. Although, if you are in for a good porn flick, then I'd rent this one.

Its inclusion makes for a very different film on the unrated DVD.  I saw this movie with my dad when it came to the cinema, and I was a little uncomfortable then, being that we are  huge fans of the original.  But had we seen this version together, I probably would have been cowering under my seat with embarrassment  This has Zombie's stamp all over it.  And his style has won him devotees.  I am fairly indifferent to his previous films.  But,  there are some redeeming qualities to this movie--his efforts are admirable.  In the end, I think it falls short of what the collective Halloween fan-base desired.  Some director's cuts don't vary much from the original release.

In the Director Cut, they replaced the escape scene of him killing four guards, to a totally not needed rape scene. I think the rape scene didn't help film but made me wish I got the Theatrical Version. In August when I first saw Halloween, the escape scene was one of my favorite scenes. The whole two guards raping a girl in Michael's room just seemed stupid, and it made me feel like I was watching Devil's Rejects, insteed of Halloween.

If you want rape and a really lame escape buy the directors cut. If you want to see Michael take out four guards, Theatrical Version. Other than the escape scene, the directors cut is pretty neat, but trust me, you want miss anything.",1198713600,3,769,4.453900709219858

2944550,2,B000VKL6Z2,"The only thing I can say for this movie is that at least it isn't another SEQUEL to the ""Halloween"" series: the last one with Busta Rhymes was so atrociously bad that I wondered to myself if John Carpenter regretted making the original in the first place.  Also, Zombie has some creepy
scenes with respect to the budding superhuman psychopath who goes by the name of Michael Myers: Loomis' black and white tapes (Malcolm McDowell is completely wasted in this role) where a young Myers wears demented masks, descending further and further into psychosis and rage.  That's about the only chill you're gonna find in this movie.

The rest is just typical Rob Zombie fare.  Young women bruised and bloody, screaming in pain, sociopathic trailer trash descending further and further into hopelessness, and scene after scene of depraved brutality for brutality's sake.

You almost get the feeling that Zombie is parodying the original: Malcolm McDowell actually hosts a college lecture on guess what, folks? ""The Devil's Eyes""!  Would that have anything to do with the lines Donald Pleasance rasped (effectively) about Myers' in the first film?  And hey, Brad Dourif is the sherrif!  Otis is the graveyard keeper for Haddonfield!
Udo Keir is in the movie for about five seconds!  Wow!

Oh, and we get treated to about fifteen minutes of a young Michael killing some mice.  Thanks, Rob.

That disturbing, unnameable, mysterious atmosphere in the original is replaced by mere slasher fare.  I have to admit that I really don't get what people are out to get with respect to Zombie as a filmmaker.  All he does is imitate classic grindhouse flicks of the 70's to very little effect.  The only redeeming quality I can find in any of his work is perhaps the increase in hygiene around the country: I've felt compelled to take a shower after watching a couple of his movies.

2944552,2,B000VKL6Z2,"After several poorly done and failed sequels, director Rob Zombie (Devil's Rejects) attempts a remake of the original 1978 John Carpenter film, ""Halloween."" Veteran actor Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) is somewhat a disappointment as Dr. Loomis, formally played by now deceased actor Donald Pleasence. Relatively newcomer Daeg Faerch makes an interesting young psycho crazed Michael Myers with the exception he is far too old for the role that was originally cast for a much younger actor. The greatest liberty in Zombie's film is that of Michael Myers lost but not forgotten sister, Laurie Strode. Zombie's  sequel paints Strode as a sexual, free thinking, rather loose, filthy mouth character, where John Carpenter saw Laurie Strode as a nave innocent good little girl, in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Zombie's Laurie Strode played by Scout Taylor Compton is completely ineffective in comparison to the 1978 version played by now veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis. Zombie adds an occasional line or two from the original movie and keeps the bone chilling musical score written by John Carpenter, even though Zombie's film completely lacks the classical ""element of surprise"" which made October 1978 movie goers scream and jump 5 feet out of the seats. Zombie is dead to the fact Halloween is a cult classic that has endured. You just can't resurrect and completely alter beyond all recognition, a film loved by a cult following for 30 years. 90% of Hollywood remakes fail as dose Halloween 2007. Zombie would have done far better filling in missing gaps from the original and in hiring actors that were far most suited for their roles. I hope and pray Dimension Films will measure their lack of success of the Halloween sequels, miraculously overcome their dementia and put Michael Myers to bed once and for all. Maybe Dimension Films can allow Michael Myers to sleep for 100 years and wake him up to star in a remake of Rip Van Winkle. This would be perfect for me as in 100 years I won't be here to watch that film, thank God!  Most of all I hope Michael Myers is never transformed into a Zombie film again. Don't get me wrong, I like Zombie films for the gore blood and guts  B movies they are, but enough already. I thing Zombie should expand beyond his horizons as I do think him capable of a mainstream film. If I am wrong about Zombie's talents, I would recommend he spend the rest of his life getting a body piercing or more tattoos.

The Fog, The Shining, Amityville Horror, The Omen, and a host of others that did not need to be remade are all reminders of this.

Halloween is one of those films that is sacred. Touching it is like touching the Rosetta Stone. If you are going to attempt to remake it you had better have something significant to add. Rob Zombie has added something significant. While keeping the original story basically intact he has added a back story and updated what needs to be updated so that the film feels contemporary.

This film was well made, well thought out, and obviously crafted by Zombie with care and reverence of the original. I was expecting it to be lame like a host of other films but it turned out to be great.

I wish all remakes were done with such care and added as much to classic films as this did. It expanded the myth in a good way.

2944554,2,B000VKL6Z2,"This Hollywood ""carnival"" of remakes is getting uglier with no end in sight. Almost none of them work and bring very little money--movie producers should have figured this out by now. But this nonsense did not stop rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie from creating a Heavy Metal version of the 1978 classic horror film Halloween. Zombie brings an upgrade by adding new materials of his own--he is also the producer and wrote the screenplay--but most of his new content does more bad than good. The film is a long, predictable, gory, unoriginal, loud and unnecessary remake. Yes, another distorted and destructive version of a classic. Like a said earlier, Hollywood is no stranger to these so-called remakes and I hope they stop.

Brief Intro Story (some small spoilers):
Introvert teenager Michael Myers lives with his dysfunctional family. He likes to wear his clown mask and loves torturing animals in his room while his stripper mother fights all the time with her alcoholic husband--Myer's older sister is not that nice either. After an incident with some bullies at school, Michael takes it to the next step. He becomes a ruthless serial killer and the bully is his first victim (this is where Zombie starts playing the classic main theme.)

It's Halloween night and while his mother is ""working"" Michael decides to kill again and starts from home--using a big kitchen knife and a baseball bat. Everybody in the house gets it except his baby sister. His mother comes home and sees little Myers holding his baby sister and realizes what happened. After this horrific incident, he is taken into custody. While in prison, after talking to Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and his mom, little Michael kills again (this time a nurse is the victim) and that pretty much seals his fate--at least for now. Years pass by and Michael is now a super ""wrestler-like"" giant who still wear his masks, but he still lives in prison. Fortunately for him, that's about to change.

Review:
Director Rob Zombie takes the freedom to explore with more detail Myers' beginning--by using his Metal artistic style. In other words, we get to see the birth of the character and probably the reasons why he becomes the T-Rex of the serial killers--a broken home and an abusive father figure are the ingredients to his behavior. But Zombie makes a fatal mistake by degrading Myers to a new regular ""sick puppy"" status. In the original film, there was a mystery surrounding Myers because we didn't know for sure, if he was even human at all. But Zombie cannot help himself and gives too much unnecessary background detail to the slasher plus superhuman physical strength. Not only he looks like a WWE wrestler, he also can take many shots to the chest and a stab to the shoulder on top of that. Wait a minute, isn't he just a ""human"" serial killer in this remake? Zombie, you're taking away the mysticism of our bogeyman.

Myers aside, the worst attributes of this Halloween are their goofy characters and their dialogue. It's all gibberish. There is no real focal point in any of them--sexual situations and dirty talk are abundant here. Not only nudity is overdone as well as the amount of blood on screen. In the original film, the killings were mostly subjective, but again Zombie follows the steps of the new ""mainstream"" of horror movies like Saw and brings an unnecessary bloodbath to the film--which by the way, the amount of blood that the victims bleed is very unrealistic.

Perhaps I'm being too harsh on Rob Zombie's effort. Despite the negativity, there are some moments of suspense that actually work. For example; young Myers killing the bully is probably the best horror scene. Also the moment when young Myers wears his white mask for the first time creating the Halloween legend, which is pretty intense to watch--the mask gets an upgrade and looks rough and scary.

The Verdict:
Moviegoers know that we have to take these remakes with a grain of salt and you don't have to be a film critic to figure that out. We've been letdown before. Rob Zombie's remake doesn't even come close to the horror and mystery of the 1978 cult classic. Adding more gore, nudity and taking away good build-up, character development and coherent dialogue are not the way to please the old school fans. Yes, there are very few moments of horror, but not enough to pay for the general admission.",1198454400,,4368,4.8328877005347595
2944555,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is an amazing remake.  When it comes to the myriad of remakes that have flooded theaters for the past decade, there have been some real clunkers.  The Omen is a prime example.  It followed every scene from the original, deviating only to splash in a little extra gore and throwing in a montage insinuating that mankind's sins (9-11 and the like) and natural disasters are signs that clearly show that the apocalypse is at hand.

Zombie's version of Halloween did not go that route.  It created something fresh.  A lot of the people that hate this movie have opinions that are biased to the point of not even being worth listening to.  I despised House of 1000 Corpses as well as Devil's Rejects.  However, I didn't let that deter me from going to see my favorite slasher being re-imagined with an open mind.  A lot of people went into this film with a set mind frame:  Halloween should have been left alone and Rob Zombie should have been kept from the material with a restraining order.  How could someone walking into a theater with that point of view possibly give it a fair review?

The content itself is fantastic.  For the first time in the history of the franchise, we get to see Michael's past.  We get to see his experiences in the mental asylum.  The role that Dr. Sam Loomis played in his early years is unveiled by a striking performance by Malcolm McDowell.  The violence is brutal and visceral.  It is as unrelenting as the audience should expect from a force of nature like Michael.  Also, while the film does reveal pieces of Michael's motivation, it never really explains why he is the way he is.  That was what John Carpenter initially intended.  He wanted his villain to be an unstoppable force of pure evil.

Zombie was sensible enough to leave many key elements largely in tact.  Michael still dons a ghost outfit.  His mask is the same.  The basic theme music stays the essentially the same.  Also, Rob Zombie avoided one of the most irksome trends in modern horror: weighing it down with a heavy metal soundtrack, and that says a lot considering that he became famous for singing heavy music.

The previous version of the franchise drug on and on and on.  It spawned pointless sequel after pointless sequel, each one filled with an increasing number of plotholes.  Case in point, at the end of part II, Loomis shoots out both of Michael's eyes.  Michael is blinded, forcing him to cover his face and swing randomly throughout the room.  When he reappears in part IV he is miraculously able to see again.  This went on until he was getting his knuckle game on with Busta Rhymes.  Would the loyal Halloween purists ask that this tradition go on until they are old and decrepid?  Rob Zombie goes back to the material that inspired the cult following and puts a new spin on it.  He also ended it in such a way that gurantees viewers will not be drug through the mud of ridiculous sequels.  But...who knows...remember what happened with H20?  Jamie Lee wasn't cutting off Michael's head, it was the paramedic!

I am disappointed that the theatrical version isn't being offered in widescreen.  However, that I can live with.  What annoys me is the incessant fodder being directed at a perfectly good remake.",1198368000,,3247,4.639718804920914
2944556,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Is it wise to try and remake the greatest horror movie of all time? No, its not. Can it be done successfully? Perhaps, with the right writer/director. And whom might be the man for the job? That would be Rob Zombie. Zombie's Halloween is gritty, realistic and character driven.

Zombie did a number of things right besides leaving the music, characters and setting in place. He made his movie a back story/prequel leading into a quasi remake. He penetrated the mythos of Michael Meyers with realistic applications of psychopathology leading into the orgins of a budding serial killer. Zombie is obviously well versed in psychology and the buisness of serial killing. Michael Meyers becomes more human and real in Zombie's version but only to a point. Meyers still retains an ominous, etheral quality and Zombie leaves the audience wanting to know even more about him and his motives. Does that suggest a sequel? No, it suggests a powerful movie experience and a worthy finale to the Halloween franchise.

As a side note:
This theatrical version is better than the unrated version because the escape sequence is more realistic and the edits make the movie less sympathetic to Michael which makes for a more streamlined and scary experience.",1198368000,2,1239,4.980676328502415
2944557,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This film, directed by Rob Zombie (The Devil's Rejects, House of 1,000 Corpses) treads on familiar territory for those familiar with Michael Myers, the slasher killer in the William Shatner mask, but takes it much further and gives much more insight into the origins of this enigmatic character. The backstory begins in 1978 in Haddonfield, Illinois, when Michael is 10 years old, portrayed by Daeg Faerch, who adores his mother Deborah (portrayed by Sheri Moon Zombie) but hates her boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe). His older sister Judith (Hanna Hall) is promiscuous and this bothers Michael. The other member of his family he adores is his younger sister Laurie, whom he affectionately calls ""Boo."" Michael's path of destruction begins with killing animals and then graduates to full-fledged murder, of his older sister, his mother's boyfriend, his sister's boyfriend and a schoolyard bully. He is then sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he is evaluated by Psychiatrist Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) who treats him for 15 years until Michael begins not speaking and shuts himself down emotionally. Michael begins an affinity for masks while locked in the Sanitarium, an obsession really, and is seen more often than not wearing homemade masks. After Loomis stops treatment and becomes a best-selling author, profiting from the deaths his patient caused, Michael, now an adult (Tyler Mane (X-Men)) escapes, killing several along the way. He then makes his way to Haddonfield, where he stalks his now-teenage sister (portrayed by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie's parents are portrayed by Dee Wallace Stone (Abominable, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Cujo, The Howling) and Pat Skipper, and her two friends, Lynda and Annie Brackett, are portrayed by Kristina Klebe and Danielle Harris (Halloween 4, Halloween 5). The rest of the film should be familiar to fans of the original, with a few surprises along the way. I should warn you-with this unrated edition, there is plenty of sex, there is plenty of swearing, there is plenty of nudity, and yes, there is plenty of violence. But these elements help to propel the story along and really make for a film experience unlike any seen in 2007. This film is not an exact carbon-copy of the original, it is not a sequel, and is not exactly a straight remake; it is a film which stands on its own as a true masterpiece of modern horror and terror. I give this one 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1198368000,,2443,5.0495049504950495
2944558,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding.  Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!

Unfortunately, the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD is not the same film that was offered to horror fans in theaters. More than just added footage that had to be cut in order to receive an ""R"" rating by the MPAA, this Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on this DVD a much weaker flick. Alas, the original scene is not even included as an extra on the disk and is missing altogether, and a few fans that missed the film in the theater run don't realize they are watching a different film.

Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but sadly the film for which he earned those kudos is not the one on the Unrated Director's Cut DVD.  Zombie should be chastised NOT delivering that great remake to his fans for home viewing.

The four-star rating is for this DVD, not the real film fans saw in theaters last fall.  Alas, Zombie's true work of art is currently only offered in the vsiually butchered 1.33:1 Wal-Mart Trailer-trash version, but fans won't find it on the Unrated Director's Cut.  Fans who want to revisit the great vision they saw in theaters can only hope that it will someday be released on DVD in widescreen...perhaps as a part of some ultimate edition package.",1198368000,14,1924,4.847560975609756
2944559,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The unrated director's cut of Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" coming out in time for Christmas?  Well, the movie only came out on August 31st of this year, which I thought was two months early for this particular film, but apparently that was so they could still get the DVD out in time for it to be an ironic if not perverse stocking stuffer (the movie was still in theaters at the start of December).  Marketing strategy aside, it should be made clear that this film is actually more than a remake of John Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B00104AL5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>.  The story of how young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) became a killer as a little kid is now the entire first act of the film and not simply the prologue, and in Zombie's revisions it is made clear why Michael picked up that big knife and started slicing and dicing.  Bullied at school, abused at home by his wicked stepfather (William Forsythe), and saddled with a stripper for a mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), Michael has more than his fair share of issues.

We also get to see some of Michael's sessions with Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and what happened to make Michael's baby sister an orphan.  This reflects the other significant difference between this and the original, which is that this time around we know that Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is Michael's sister.  Actually, in the final analysis this movie covers what happens in the original and what happens in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequel/dp/B00005LC4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequel</a>&nbsp;(and if you want to stretch things Michael's fascinating with masks could be a wink and a nod to the atrocious ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-III-Season-Of-The-Witch/dp/B0000AOX09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween III - Season Of The Witch</a>"").  Not that Laurie ever makes it to the hospital, but in the end it come to the siblings.  That sounds like a lot, to condense two movies and add a whole new first act, but once Zombie gets to Halloween present he concentrates on hitting the highlights from the original and throwing in plenty of echoes from the originals: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-from-Another-World/dp/B00009NHC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing from Another World</a>"" is still playing on the television and ""Mr. Sandman"" is still being sung.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Zombie's strategy in making this film.  On the one hand he sticks to the unforgettable music of Carpenter's original score, but on the other he avoids going head to head with that movie's iconic scene when Laurie finds the tableau display of Annie's corpse.  I also have to say there was a lot less blood and gore than I would have suspected given Zombie's previous cinematic efforts (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Rejects/dp/B000AXWHSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Rejects</a>""), but there is a concerted effort here to be more in the style of the original and it is nice to be reminded that a good door slam can be more terrorizing that a geyser of blood.  It is for that slight change in sensibilities, plus all the nifty DVD extras, that lead me to round up on this one.  It goes without saying that the remake does not surpass the original--which stands out in our memories because for most of us it was the first time we saw the killer keep getting up again and again--but no one ever thinks that is going to be the case, so when that turns out to be the case it is not a surprise.  Just do not be surprised when you finish watch this remake that you do not feel the urge to go back and enjoy the original yet again.",1198368000,2,3888,5.543918918918919
2944560,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Michael Myers is finally getting the makeover he has need for quite some time. Just like Mr. Voorhees, Michael has become more of a joke as studios continue to crank out their umpteenth installment of another slasher film to make minimal profits. Rob Zombie introduces us to a young Michael Myers growing up in a dysfunctional family and it is very entertaining stuff.

The return of the classical characters like Dr. Loomis was fine, because he was critical to the overall history. I felt the movie would have been better if Rob had just created all new characters beyond that, while keeping the historical facts concerning Michael intact. We see when Rob used his creative license to fill in gaps for young Michael growing up or his time in the mental institute, the movie is a lot fresher and fun to watch. The last hour basically picks up where we get a lot of redone scenes from the original. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was all well done...but scenes like the ""ghost sheet"" scene and others being included make me wonder what Rob might have come up with on his own. If there is a sequel, we might find out!

As far as director commentary, Rob delivers again with some pretty cool insights on the movie and the extras are a lot of fun. I'm not sure if Rob would do another remake, but Friday the 13th could use it. Once the franchise veered off to Manhatten, then Hell, and even into the future in Outer Space, it was time for someone to wake up.",1198281600,,1456,4.449438202247191

But,even with the deleted scenes...There were still scenes not on the DVD.....Like the scene with Bill Moseley & Leslie Easterbrook. SO.....I purchased the Theatrical Cut as well. The Special Features are the same as the Unrated DVD.",1198281600,2,408,5.390625
2944562,4,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, I grew up watching alot of slasher genre films and the original two Halloween films scared the crap out of me as a kid, plus I've been a big fan of Rob Zombie's twisted creativity for many years so I was really excited about his updated take on what has become known as one of the greatest slasher film franchises ever.
  Having seen it in the theater and loving it, I looked forward to the inevitable ""Director's"" or ""Unrated"" cut of the film on DVD. I can't say I was disappointed but this version of the film feels more sympathetic to the monstrous Michael Myers, whereas the original cut left it more for the audience to decide for themselves if Michael deserves any sympathy. I was left with a strong satisfaction for Michael's fate and Laurie's reclamation of her homicidal birthright, the ""Unrated Cut"" stole a bit of that away from me. I was left with more compassion for Michael, and an overwhelming sense of pity for Laurie's destroyed innocence. This version of the film, through the deletion of the theatrical version's bloody massacre of the asylum guards and the insertion of Michael's violent revenge against two repugnant orderlies, fine-tuned a possible message of Michael's gory mission to find his beloved Laurie-- perhaps even to restore some warped semblance of his previous life.
  Rob has injected a more obvious tragedy to the story of Michael Myers and his search for Laurie. I feel almost a mythic connotation to it all, urban mythic-- the boogeyman with the heart of gold, or at least, gold-plated.
  At times, many people-- and critics-- have allowed nostalgia for John Carpenter's original film to obscure their objectivity in reviewing Rob's version. I won't go into my opinions of the original, but I did thoroughly enjoy this updated version. It has even made me lust after a Rob Zombie retelling of Jason Voorhees' and Freddy Krueger's stories-- imagine ho farked-up those would be.
  Anyway, BUY THIS but BEWARE, this version of the film is radically different with just a few subtle-- and one not-so-subtle-- changes! You'll feel the difference, and that isn't always for the best.",1198281600,3,2127,4.872576177285318
2944563,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Unlike Gus Van Sant's 1998 ""Psycho"" remake, in which he decided to match Hitchcock's original film shot-for-shot, Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" adds his own vision to the Carpenter original. The result? It's a more brutal film, especially when no blood is being shed. Example: A thoroughly bummed-out and disillusioned young Michael Myers sits on a curb on Halloween night, in costume, as the other kids go frolicking by. Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"" plays in the background while Zombie ping-pongs between shots of Michael and his stripper mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) working the pole at the local dive bar. It's a master stroke, the kind of thing Rob seems to do so well and so effortlessly...how DO you show sympathy toward a character that's largely unsympathetic?

Another smart decision was to have Malcom McDowell in the role of Dr. Loomis. If you're familiar with the backstory of the original Halloween films, you know that the late Donald Pleasance has been credited as the ""mojo"" behind those films, an established actor who graciously became involved at a lower pay rate than he was accustomed to because he believed in Carpenter and his story. McDowell does his own thing here. He does not ""reinvent"" the role as much as he expands on it, just like the movie expands on John Carpenter's foundation.

The ""Zombie Regulars"" are here, and it adds to the squirm factor to see Danielle Harris from ""Halloween 4"" and Halloween 5"" in the role of Myers victim Annie Brackett. Scout Taylor-Compton plays the role of Laurie Strode more like a teenager and less like an adult...she's definitely not channelling Jamie Lee Curtis on any level, and that's a good thing. It was a brilliant move to have Sid Haig and Bill Moseley in relatively minor, supporting roles...it thoroughly obliterates any temptation to compare the film to ""The Devil's Rejects"" (there IS no comparison...they are two completely different movies).

Some people will feel that the movie never should have been made, others (like myself) had no choice but to watch it based on the strength of Mr. Zombie's two previous directorial efforts. I feel that is significantly better than ANY ""official"" Halloween film that followed ""Halloween 5.""",1198281600,3,2207,5.024590163934426

First part of the film is decent, watchable, semi interesting, blah...  Then the 15 years later flashes on the screen and the 100 foot cliff appears and the film takes a leap.  PAINFUL!  Rob seemed to get bored at this point and just threw the rest all together.  To say the least when this movie ended I stood up and uttered these words out loud...""THIS MOVIE SUC!ED BA!!$ !!!"" no joke...
  Fast forward to the DVD.  Now I decided to watch again to make sure I wasn't just fooling myself.  So after watching it with the extras I learned that Rob Zombie lived in a 20 person town full of nimrods.  Hmmm let me put in extras of Myers walking 20 feet behind people in Daylight!  YES DAYLIGHT!  I don't know about you but if I see a 7 foot 320 pound monster wearing a freekin mask walking down the street it might be cause for alarm!!!  HUH?  WHAT??  YEA! And holy crud!  He casts the same people that were in his last 2 movies!  They must owe him some favors or something. The rest of it just drives me crazy.  I don't understand the directors today that have to shake the camera on the ""stressful"" moments in the movie.  It takes away from the action and is just plain dumb.
  The Extras were a bore.  Zombie looks like he just wished he didn't make the movie during the interview.  Nothing but sigh talk sigh talk..
  So this movie is a rental at most just so you can say you watched another crappy remake that didn't live up to the billing.  I know fan boys that he wanted to do something different and not have the ""Boogyman"" Myers but if that is what he wanted then she should of came up with something original...",1198195200,,1771,4.196428571428571
2944568,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Is it wise to try and remake the greatest horror movie of all time? No, its not. Can it be done successfully? Perhaps, with the right writer/director. And whom might be the man for the job? That would be Rob Zombie. Zombie's Halloween is gritty, realistic and character driven.

Zombie did a number of things right besides leaving the music, characters and setting in place. He made his movie a back story/prequel leading into a quasi remake. He penetrated the mythos of Michael Meyers with realistic applications of psychopathology leading into the orgins of a budding serial killer. Zombie is obviously well versed in psychology and the buisness of serial killing. Michael Meyers becomes more human and real in Zombie's version but only to a point. Meyers still retains an ominous, etheral quality and Zombie leaves the audience wanting to know even more about him and his motives. Does that suggest a sequel? No, it suggests a powerful movie experience and a worthy finale to the Halloween franchise.

As a side note:
The theatrical version is better than this unrated version because the escape sequence is more realistic and the edits make the movie less sympathetic to Michael which makes for a more streamlined and scary experience.",1198108800,2,1239,4.980676328502415

The ENTIRE POINT of Rob Zombie's version was to give HIS VERSION of the story. There's already more than enough crappy sequels trying to continue John Carpenter's story. The studio obviously saw no point sinking good money after bad in another one, so they had Rob Zombie create his version, not realizing that so many people still hadn't cut the apron strings from the first film.

I just watched the DVD (I bought the 3-DVD set exclusive to Circuit City). If you can watch the film without crying about every time Zombie deviated from the original film, it's actually very well done.",1198108800,3,816,4.821428571428571
2944570,3,B000VKL6Z2,"The Halloween series has always been one of my favorite horror film series, and in fact, its probably the most well-rounded and credible horror series when to compared to Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and so on. After all, there are no really bad sequels in this series (with the exception of Halloween III which isn't a real horrible movie itself, but has nothing to to with the Michael Myers story and therefore really has no relevance). There has been no ""Michael in Space"" or ""Zombie Michael Myers that gets buried and resurrected"" plots in this series, and for that, I have to commend them for that. However, when I first heard about this ""remake"" of the original Halloween, I thought it was a terrible idea. Why in the world would you want to remake a classic like Halloween? Its just like all these other remakes that seem to dominate theaters these days. Can't anyone think of anything original anymore? And almost all these remakes are no not even close to being as good as the original film. There's absolutely no reason to remake a film like Halloween unless its only to cash in. And that's probably the real reason why this movie was even considered being made in the first place. These people know that its gonna bring in horror fans, both young and old, out of the woodwork. And of course, fans are gonna be critical and compare the two films relentlessly. So to all the movie producers and film makers out there..STOP REMAKING CLASSIC FILMS!! All you guys are doing is watering down and for the most part ruining the reputations of actual good movies!! Okay, now that off of my chest, let's start the review, shall we?

  First of all, to say that this is purely a remake is incorrect. Its half prequel, half remake, really. But when I found out that Rob Zombie would be writing and directing the picture, my hopes got much brighter about the film. I love House of the 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, and I really thought that he would bring something new to the series but without screwing everything up. After watching the film in theaters, and now on DVD, I can't say that he didn't bring something new to Halloween series, but for the most part, I definitely think he did more harm than good. I just have a hard time accepting this movie as being anything but mediocre, really. There's just way too many things that I didn't like about the actual plot of the story, and yes, way too many differences, and flat out contradictions of that of the original Halloween. I know, maybe its unfair to compare it the original Halloween so closely, but dammit, I can't help it. I love the original film. Its gotta be one the best horror films ever made. And just don't like the fact that someone can come in and nearly change everything about it, and yet call it, if only partially in this case, a remake.

  First off, almost all the backstory of the young Michael Myers is total contradiction to the original film. Yeah, I know there wasn't really anything shown or told about Myers' childhood or family life in any of the films, but then again, there was no hint of anything BAD happening to him either! Why did Zombie feel the need to put in every bad cliche into the home life of young Michael Myers. Living in a trashy environment, a stripper mom, an abusive, drunk father figure, a bitch of a sister, being bullied at school, being neglected, and the list goes on an on. It seems like Zombie was GIVING Michael Myers a reason to become the monster he became! That's not what the original film was about. The great thing about that film was the idea that no one knew why Michael did what he did. He had no reason. That's what's scary about it. How a normal boy could do something like that without a cause. But here, you don't have that.

  Another thing I didn't like was the acting and the portrayal of some of the characters, especially the Lorrie Strode character played by Scout Taylor-Compton. She's just so damn annoying!! Geez, Jamie Lee Curtis did such a good job of playing the ""girl next door"" role, and here you have a annoying, bubbly, whore wanna be. I know that you gotta modernize the characters a bit, but c'mon! I was wanting Michael to kill Lorrie a minute into her first scene, not to mention her friends, which were just as bad! Now it is worth mentioning, that when the chase scenes with Lorrie and Michael begin, Taylor-Compton actually does a pretty good acting good there. Also, Daeg Faerch, who played young Michael Myers, and well as Sheri Moon Zombie, who played Michael's mother, Deborah, just didn't fit the parts to me. Faerch acting wasn't all that great, and he just didn't look the part, and Sheri Moon's acting was alright, but seeing her play that kind of role just doesn't look right to me. And Malcolm McDowell didn't exactly put on a brilliant performance himself either.

  Other things I didn't like..well.. the scene where 10 year old Michael kills his sister in his trademark mask just looks, well..stupid. The mask is huge and looks dumb on a child's body, and its not scary at all. Not even a little. And speaking of body, I really thought that the Michael Myers character was too physically big. Michael Myers is supposed just some average looking guy, not a professional wrestler, so why make him so larger than life? The way Michael seems to ""grunt"" numerous times in the film, what the heck is up with that? And the way Michael seems to try ""interrogate"" Lorrie's step mom by showing her Lorrie's picture and I assume, trying to find where she was at..just way out of the Michael Myers character for me. I also thought the music was mis-used in the film. At times, it felt like Zombie was trying to use the music to build a mood, when there was really nothing there to build upon.

  Alright, enough of the bashing of this film. I actually have some good things to say about it. After all, I am giving it 3 stars! First off, I like the blood gore content. A definite step up from the original, though just to make things clear, you don't need blood and guts and gore to make a film, nor does that stuff make a film good. But I'm just saying I liked that aspect of this film. Also, the guys who did the Michael Myers mask did a great job on this one. It looks real close to the original mask. And speaking of the mask, Tyler Mane does a pretty decent job of portraying Michael Myers as well. I also felt that the last half hour of the film was real good too. I especially liked the scenes where Lorrie was hiding from Michael in-between the walls and in the loft of the house. I thought Zombie really did a good job there.

  So finally I've come to the end of this ungodly long review! Thanks to those you've actually read this whole thing. In closing, I know that I'm probably being too critical about some of the things I didn't like about this film. And if I had never seen the original, or wasn't a big fan of the original film, I probably wouldn't be so critical and be picking out every single little thing that's different from the original. I know that when a remake of a film is made, you can't simply copy everything from the original, otherwise, what's the point in remaking it? But on the other hand, how can you call something a remake, when in fact, there are so few similarities between it and the original? There's got to be some balance somewhere. Anyways,as a stand alone film, maybe its better than I'm giving it credit for. And if it hadn't been a ""Halloween"" movie, and just another horror film, I might have loved it. And again, that's why I'm giving it a benefit of a doubt and trying to ignore my biased opinion and giving this film 3 stars. However, I can't help to compare to the original classic. And this one doesn't ever really come close in capturing the mood or suspense that the original film did. And as far as comparing to the other films in the series, this is one of the worse. Is it worth watching or worth owning? I say yes to both. But its nothing really great to watch, and I wouldn't say its a ""must buy"" unless you have all the other Halloween films and need for your collection. And thats one of the very few reasons, I own this film right now.",1198108800,,8194,4.447701532311792
2944571,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Horror fans! Don't hate me, but the Rob Zombie remake of ""Halloween"" could quite possibly be better than the John Carpenter directed original. I love the first ""Halloween"" (I even caught it at a movie theatre where they played it the night before Halloween and the day of) and I love Rob Zombie's previous two movies. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" wasn't very good, but I enjoyed it...And ""The Devil's Rejects"" was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Zombie's re-imagining of ""Halloween"" sticks close enough to the original store to not upset horror buffs, but puts his own stamp on it at the same time. One thing the film does is delve a bit deeper into the childhood of Michael Myers. The movie opens on Halloween, where we meet the family. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon) is a stripper with an abusive, drunken, crippled boyfriend. He has a baby sister and an older sister and, besides wearing masks constantly appears fairly normal. Well, for two seconds...Until we watch him slaughter his pet rat. Pretty soon, Michael has killed a schoolyard bully and, while his mother is at work, he kills the boyfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend...Leaving only the baby alive. Sent to a mental asylum, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, who is nice to see in a nice-guy role) is assigned to treat Michael. Pretty soon though, Michael has killed a nurse at the asylum and has withdrawn into his mind...And not long after, his mother commits suicide. 15 years later; Michael escapes from the asylum and decides to try and find his sister. Most of the things that happen after his escape will seem quite familar to watchers of the original film. Zombie did a really great job with this movie. Learning about the Myers character was very interesting and creepy. His casting of McDowell (whom he no doubt cast over his love for ""A Clockwork Orange"") was great, as well as casting Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) as a cop. The aging of the characters is very well done. When we meet Loomis in the beginning, he looks like a fairly younger guy. 15 years later; Loomis looks like...Well, Malcolm McDowell. ""Halloween"" has it's share of originality on top of the things that were necessary for the remake (i.e., the music). But this is easily the best remake I've seen of a horror film in a good long while. Rob Zombie is a very gifted writer/director (I'm starting to like his movies better than I ever liked his music) and I hope he continues, because this movie already shows that Zombie has created a signature style (listen to the dialogue between Michael's mother and her boyfriend in the beginning of the film). Anyway, as it is a horror film...It's no masterpiece. And it has its share of nudity and violence, but overall...It's a work of art.

2944572,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I hate remakes.  The horror genre has become a breeding ground for remakes and re-hashes of classic films in the genre, as is the case with Halloween.  As flawed as House of 1000 Corpses was, musician turned director Rob Zombie more than made up for it with The Devil's Rejects, which really seemed to find him coming into his own.  That's why I was looking forward to the Halloween remake, of which I had heard both great and terrible things about.  After viewing it, well, it's not nearly as terrible as what I had heard, but at the same time, the film is a needless remake that wastes much of it's potential.  The subtlety of John Carpenter's original classic is replaced with brutal violence and buckets of blood, as we witness the beginnings of Michael Myers' (played as a child by Daeg Faerch, and later by X-Men's Tyler Mane) journey to becoming a killer from his childhood on, as Zombie makes an attempt to give the viewer a sympathetic view towards Michael.  The relationship with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is further examined as well, as is Michael's return to Haddonfield.  The abundance of backstory and sympathetic view towards Michael Myers is where Halloween fails, but where it succeeds is with Zombie's techniques for getting the most out of the shocks and scares that he pummels the viewer with.  The final act, in which Michael faces off with Laurie Strode (the super cute Scout Taylor-Compton), is a visceral blast, as is what leads up to it.  As he has done before, Zombie has peppered genre stalwarts throughout the film, including his wife Sheri Moon, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree, Sid Haig, and an all grown up Danielle Harris, whose role here is a far cry from the petrified child of Halloween 4 and 5.  The two-disc Unrated edition features an insightful commentary from Zombie, plenty of deleted scenes (including Adrienne Barbeau's deleted role), a more downbeat alternate ending, and a pretty funny blooper reel.  Not for the faint of heart to be sure, Rob Zombie's Halloween remake isn't anything spectacular, but it's nothing terrible in the least either, and more than worth checking out for horror/slasher fans young and old alike.",1198108800,5,2263,4.851948051948052
2944573,2,B000VKL6Z2,"What can I say, this update disapointed me. While the introduction and history of the pre-teen Michael Myers was nice as a prequel of sorts, the almost word-for-word remake of that fateful Halloween night fifteen years when ""He"" came home lacked the same spark as the first time around. Each new actor seemed to turn in a murder-by-numbers approach with the established characters, and the movie's new ending really paled in comparision to the 1978 original. While to any fan of the Halloween franchise should see this at least once, it will definitely NOT replace your yearly viewings of the original. If only Rob Zombie concentrated on making a prequel only instead of this watered down attempt to lure a new generation of audiences, this could have been a little more satifiying.

While I'm here, let me let others in on what exactly is on that Circuit City exclusive bonus third disc. First off, it's in a paper sleeve (not part of the original packaging), that has only one extra feature, a 20 minute discussion with Rob Zombie & three other cast members at Comic-Con 2007. In fact, it doesn't even have a menu, just plop in the disc and it begins. I was wondering why this wasn't just put on the 2 disc as maybe an easter egg or something, it should have fit in the space nicely. Oh, and concerning that regular's second disc....if you missed Malcolm McDowell's personality from ""A Clockwork Orange"" after he made that film, check out the 10 minutes of Bloopers with him, he's a riot, almost as if this film brought out the lost ""Alex De Large"" outta him again. It's just too bad it didn't show during the actual movie.

2944575,3,B000VKL6Z2,"It seems that Rob Zombie's efforts are usually hit or miss. Unfortunately, this one slips somewhere between the cracks of both. I'm not going to relay the story, as several people already have, but instead I'd like to lay out a few key points (positive and negative) on the film.

  The first act of the film deals with Michael Myer's childhood and the reasons behind his descent into madness. The original film provided us with no real reason for his bloodthirst and honestly...did we really need a explanation? Isn't it scarier to NOT know? Regardless, I was hoping the same as everyone else that Zombie would come up with a creative and original idea...he did not. Micheal Myers is an unstoppable serial killer because he was picked on in school, his mom was a stripper and his home life sucked. Seriously, that's it?! THAT is what we've been waiting for? I could turn on any daytime drama and find the same tired old plot. To make it even less appealing we are literally birraged with over-the-top foul language and brutal violence. Mr. Zombie seems to be in the mind set that violent images and grotesque deaths are more important than any actual scares in his ""horror"" movie.
  The second act has Micheal in Smith's Grove. Personally, I found this entire sequence to be boring. We get it...the kid is nuts. To make matters worse the ""unrated"" version contains the most un-necessary rape scene in film history. It serves no purpose other than to simply ""shock"" the audience. Just because you make something controversial Rob, doesn't mean that it's good.
  The best part of the film is the third act, where we meet Laurie Strode and her friends (the re-make kickoff). There are some decent moments in the third act and even a few unexpected scares. Rob used the audience's knowledge of the first film as a manipulation tool. I could go on and on with the issues I have but there is one that is so outstanding I can't get over it. The dialogue is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It seems like the lines were written the day of shooting. When Lori and her friends are in the library she has the following line...

""Annie wants me to pretend to babysit Lindsay-Wallace, then sneak out and dump her with me so she can go and see Paul.""

 That doesn't even make sense. At all. Who wrote this? And it's just not in this scene, but in fact the entire ""Girl talk"" dialogue that happens is so cheestastic you can't help but laugh. The best lines in the film were imports from the original film with one or two words changed to a synonym (good job, Rob).

  The bottom line is, the negatives of this film FAR outweigh the positive. Mr. Zombie needs to worry less about making stylized 70s' trash and more about making a HORROR MOVIE.

  And if you're wondering what more we're getting in the 11 minutes...well...naked girls being raped and murdered. Yay. We've seen it all before and... it was better before.",1197936000,2,2892,4.608187134502924
2944576,2,B000VKL6Z2,"There's a scene in the original Halloween where through the camera's POV complete with holes functioning as our eyes, we follow a figure walk through a house, grab a knife and proceed upstairs to viciously attack a young girl only for it at the end to be a young boy in a clown mask. Later he grows into an unstoppable killing machine that stalks and terrorizes comes after you and no bullet or knife can stop him. It was that feeling of an evil that would continously coming after you that made ""the Shape"" such a memorable horror icon. Apparently that notion was lost on Rob Zombie who thought that clearly we need an explanation as to why he'd be such a monster (beware of hick families is the message here) and not only from a story standpoint but from a filmmaking one as well, the new Halloween just hits all the wrong notes - no pun intended, Mr. Zombie - the whole time.

Michael Myers is a seriously disturbed young boy growing up with a promiscuous sister, a controlling father figure and a stripper mother who at least tries to help. But after viciously killing his family, save his mother, Michael is institutionalized under care of Dr. Samuel Loomis. But 15 years pass and Michael escapes and makes his way back to his home of Haddonfield where he tries to track down his baby sister, Laurie.

Whereas ""the Shape"" of 1978 liked to appear in the shadows, ominously watching teenagers unaware to his presence, this new guy likes to just mindlessly bash stuff in and be as loud as possible (he's like one of those hulking brutes with the deep voice and lack of intelligence that school bullies have for protection) and this practically sucks the suspense right from the film. Remember that scene where Michael sits right up behind Laurie who doesn't see him? Nothing like that here. Not to mention the gaps in the story like the lack of trick-or-treaters, Michael's seemingly psychic knowledge of Laurie's school schedule, her present appearance, much less her name. Then of course there's things in the filmmaking spectrum like out-of-focus shots, out-of-character decisions and dialogue, continuity errors like crazy and just strange cuts (in one scene, Laurie is behind hauled away by Michael kicking and screaming and in the next shot, she's passed out being carried off by Michael. Uh, did he punch her out?) With the Zombie trademark of characters swearing with reckless abandon, and I might add, zero creativity, this Halloween version is just unfortunate.

As far as casting is concerned, the Samuel Loomis of this one, played by Malcolm Macdowell is a good one and the young boy playing Michael is good as well while the rest either overact, don't act enough or just not simply given nothing to do. The new Laurie, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, is easy on the eyes but she almost seems to be given one direction: be cute and scream your face off when the terror starts. The casting is just one of many a problem that the film faces and quite simply, there's just not enough to recommend.

In all good seriousness, I just can't recommend this. Sure it does stand out from Carpenter's original and not just a clone and the idea of exploring the evil sounds like a good idea but this is just one unfortunate business of a film.",1197936000,,3245,4.687719298245614
2944577,5,B000VKL6Z2,"this is a darker, grittier retelling of John Carpenter's classic horror flick that began the slasher genre.

2944578,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I've read quite a few different reviews,that stated Rob Zombie's new remake DIDN'T work,because it was almost a scene for scene remake that simply had nothing new to offer,that would allow it to stand up against the original (In fact,that is what kept me from seeing it in the theatre).Now that it's been released on dvd,I simply couldn't resist the temptation of purchasing it,and judging for myself (being a big fan of the original).Well,I'm glad I did...I found myself totaly immersed throughout the entire film. Yes,alot of it is scene for scene the same as the original,but how else could it be the ""same"" movie?? Enough of it is done different,to make it more than just ok (compared to the original or just horror film standards in general).I'm not going to give the ""different"" parts away here,but I found the whole thing very well done. Unlike many of the previous reviewers,I found the young Michael Myers childhood storyline,worked very well within the story as a whole. Rob Zombie has once again brought his own love of the horror classics into his work as a film director (he makes the types of films that he himself would have wanted to see,and it shows).Once again,a great soundtrack (Kiss,Blue Oyster Cult and Rush)and some great cameo guests (Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees)add to the fun. One thing that DID surprise me though,given Rob's attention to detail,is the ""non-vintage"" Kiss Destroyer shirt,that young Michael wore in the beginning of the film (shirt is 1996 era).With plenty of great extras and bonus material,this new 2 disc package is sure to provide plenty of BIG fun for any and all fans of great/classic horror films,both old and new.",1197936000,3,1665,4.907801418439717
2944579,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I was really looking forward to this remake ever since I heard about it. Zombie directing a Halloween remake/prequel? Heck yeah! What did I get? A stereotypical ""tormented kid"" who likes to kill animals. On the day it is discovered that he kills animals (the day being Halloween doesn't seem to be any catalyst) he kills a kid from school, and then goes home to be further tormented by his scummy family. Then, when he finds he can't go trick or treating, he kills his sister, her boyfriend, and his stepdad (if in fact his mother married the guy). After the cops pick him up, Mikey (who is still talking) claims he can't remember the event. Yet slowly he starts wearing masks and withdrawing, until he kills a nurse at which point he becomes ""the shape"", by which I mean he shoots up to the 7-8 foot mark, and trades in his mass of body fat for toned muscle.

It is here that we turn from the more reality based bad childhood, to the completely unrealistic Halloween portion. Honestly, what mental hospital would let a guy (especially one this physically scary) indulge in his obsession of mask-making? What guard would, after knowing what the guy did as a kid and obviously seeing the physical build, treat the guy in such a gentle manner? What about the physical build itself? Did they allow him to spend hours in a gym... with a trainer? Wouldn't they shave his hair? Completely unbelievable. The rest of the movie is just a rehash of the original, but without any tension, no compassion for the victims, and a spelling out that Laurie Strode is Mikey's sister... oh, and Dr. Loomis (who starts out as a bit of a beatnik, but then sells his story and seems to forget about Mikey until he escapes) is killed.

I know what Zombie was trying to do (at least I think I do). He was trying to bring the Myers mythology into a ""real"" world situation, giving the kid a real (or at least clinical) reason to turn psycho. The problem is that we have seen that before. We've seen the innocent kid, ruined by his environment, turned into a monster. That's why the original has so much power... because we didn't know why. It gave the story a mystical quality. Why did he kill? What did he think inside his catatonic state for 15 years? How could he drive a car? Why doesn't he die? Zombie's version answers all these questions, but the answers are cheap. Easy answers like, ""Because he was abused."" Or having him NOT be catatonic, or NOT drive a car. That's even better, cause then there is no question. ""He doesn't die because he's really big."" It cheapens the whole idea of the movie. The only question that still remains is how does he know Laurie is his sister? (why even have the whole sister thing since this is suppossed to exist outside of all the other movies. we didn't even know Laurie was his sister until the sequal) This part is left unanswered, unless you say something like, ""Because their bond was THAT strong.""

This honestly doesn't deserve the name of Halloween. This should have been called ""Mask"", advertised as yet another in the ""gritty and real"" horror movies, and then thrown in the pile with all those other nu-slashers (wolf creek, wrong turn, house of wax-the remake) and remembered only for being a mis-step in Zombie's filmography (hopefully).",1197936000,,3266,4.579487179487179

However, this is really quite the muddled mess and there's very little to like, or horrify.

The over the top characters and acting that worked so well in Devil's simply falls flat here and seems entirely out of place. Unfortunately, the movie never finds it pacing, and isn't able to generate an iota of suspense.  On the upside, fabulous to see the wonderful Dee Wallace on the screen, she's terrific.

Then he gets up after 15 seconds of them doing this bad rape scene, to crushing them to death. So if you are like me, and liked that particular part of the movie, then I would not pick this up. I am trying to find out if that scene is in the regular rated R version because I just do not understand how you take that scene out of the movie, to be replaced by this rape scene. If anyone else knows, would be very helpful. Other than that, it's a good 2 disc set, with good funny bloop takes, and deleted scene out takes.

2944582,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a awesome remake! Rob Zombie gives us a better look at how Myers became the way he is without straying too far from the original story.

2944583,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Ever since the announcement that Rob Zombie would be re-imagining John Carpenterfs slasher classic Halloween, critics and horror fans alike have been picking sides, alternately at arms over what they saw as a modern travesty and supportive of Zombiefs ability to recreate and update the thrills of what many consider the original slasher flick (though Black Christmas - recently reworked for 2006fs Black Xmas - appeared in Canada over four years earlier than the original Halloween).

The film's release in late August did little to quell the controversy: critics panned it and audiences showed up in droves to push the film to a record-breaking Labor Day weekend opening. Regardless of critics words and filmgoers money, though, where does Rob Zombie's Halloween stand in the annals of horror movie history? After viewing the unrated directorfs cut of the film, along with a second disc packed full of special features, it's not a clear cut (no pun intended) victory for either side. If anything is clear, it's what Zombie attempted to do with his re-imagining: 1. Propel his film career forward by exposing himself to a wider fanbase, and 2. Attempt to psychologically deconstruct one of American horrorfs most infamous killers. Itfs obvious from the film's box office numbers that Zombie accomplished his first goal, but the second goal is a little more difficult to assess.

Opening in 1978 (a clever nod to the year the original film came out), the audience witnesses a young Michael Myers (eeriely portrayed by young Daeg Faerch) navigating his way through an abusive household, getting bullied by older kids at school, and being neglected by his stripper mother (played by Zombiefs own wife Sheri Moon Zombie). Though the opening scenes are raw and gritty - Zombies specialty - the foulness and crassness of the Myers household actually begins to take away from the assertion that Michael Myers, like Damien from The Omen, was simply born disturbed and evil. The incessant ranting by his motherfs boyfriend, and the older punks at school may serve as worthy impetuses for Michaelfs repressed violent nature and help explain his desire to hide behind a mask, but ultimately this takes away from the simple horror of a psychotic killer arising from a typical, run-of-the-mill household.

As Michael tortures and kills his pet rats, itfs clear Zombie is drawing on real serial killer history (animal torture is an early sign of sociopathy).  The reworking of the initial murder scene from the first Halloween is also strikingly impressive. In fact, for the first hour of the film, as Zombie's Myers unfolds before a bewildered audience, it starts to feel as if Zombie may have done the unthinkable and successfully created a back story that both evokes the original and adds new haunting layers to it. Malcolm McDowellfs intense Dr. Loomis provides a credible foil to Myersf silent stoicism, and playing on the mask theme works in Zombie's favor as little Michael quietly tells his mother that the mask hides [his] ugliness.

Unfortunately, once the inevitable fast-forward 15 years occurs and an older Michael Myers is accidentally let free of his sanitarium cell (in one of the most overly and unnecessarily perverse scenes in recent history) all hell breaks loose - both on and off screen. Michael sets off on his rampage of violence and Zombie's screenwriting prowess is tested beyond its breaking point. As anyone who saw The Devil's Rejects knows, Zombie is somewhat of a master at the disturbing, the subversive, and the grotesque, but when it comes to writing dialogue for suburban families and teenie bopper girlfriends, Zombie is out of his element, and his film suffers for it. Rather than continuing along the semi-realistic slant he had been following, suddenly Zombie begins to flounder. The conversations are stilted and unnatural and no character manages to evoke even a hint of redeeming qualities.

Meanwhile, Myers roams the street in broad daylight, with nary a frightened pedestrian in sight. This concept may have worked if Myers were of normal stature, but the casting of the 6' 8"" WCW star Tyler Mane as Myers makes his bemasked public appearances on quiet suburban sidewalks a little too imposing to go unnoticed. That's not to say that Mane's portrayal of the masked killer is at all faulty. His hulking physical presence and vacant stares provide more than enough chills to go around. But by the same token, those same qualities almost demand that Myers remain in the shadows as he did in the original.

Scout Taylor-Compton has little to offer as Myers' sole surviving relative Laurie Strode. A few painful scenes as a babysitter and some even more painful screaming and crying will leave audiences feeling more pain than perhaps Laurie herself feels. The fact that she can never find her way out of a mess and insists on constantly running up stairs does little to endear her to audiences. In fact, she made such a minimal impression in Zombie's original script that he changed the ending to ensure that she grew as a character. (The original ending is included in the special features).

Zombie's film does up the gore factor considerably, and the nudity factor as well. These unneeded additions could be nods to the unillustrious history of the horror/slasher film, or they could just be softballs to a built in audience Zombie is seeking to connect with; either way they're taken straight out of the Horror 101 handbook. Still, this 2007 Halloween towers over the recent glut of horror classic remakes that have hit theatres: The Omen, The Amityville Horror, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Fog, House of Wax, The Hitcher, Black Christmas, The Wicker Manc etc. Only The Hills Have Eyes and Halloween have had the audacity to do more than simply remake the originals with glossier film. Instead these films have taken the original concepts and expanded on them for a new generation of viewers.

While Rob Zombie's Halloween has done nothing to tarnish his name, it's also done nothing to improve upon his filmmaking cred. Perhaps the leap from House of 1000 Corpses to The Devil's Rejects was so vast that audiences should have expected a bit of levelling out with his newest film, but here's hoping he'll continue to push the envelope that he opened with his impressively unique and startlingly dark foray into the world of film.

The second disc of special features is exceptionally broad, and even includes a six minute blooper reel (mainly featuring Malcom McDowell's superbly un-PC riffs). A breakdown of the mask construction and a discussion with director Rob Zombie on his re-imagining offer a good deal of information for anyone interestd. The deleted scenes are here, but of course itfs clear that theyfve been deleted for a reason.  There's a brief breakdown of the entire cast, as well as clips from casting sessions. Much like the film itself, this special features disc leaves little to the viewer's imagination, but if you don't want to know, don't watch it.",1197849600,3,7006,5.010309278350515

Why would a self-professed horror film buff like Zombie even try to remake a revered classic like Halloween? Hubris? Fanboy wish fulfillment? Or, did he figure that this film was going to be made one way or another and rather than let some hack do a crappy job; he could at least bring his stylistic touches and point-of-view to the table.

Zombie's remake works because he takes the Halloween mythos and expands it in all kinds of fascinating ways. He makes some really intriguing choices like not making Michael supernaturally strong but rather a big guy who is naturally tough and strong. Zombie also opts for gritty realism like he did with The Devil's Rejects and it is a smart choice that works. Whether you love or hate his take on the material, you have to admit that it doesn't resemble Carpenter's film in any way. It is easily the best Halloween film since Part III, although that isn't really saying much when you consider the quality of the subsequent sequels.

The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Rob Zombie. He points out the various locations they shot in while also drawing our attention to where he took footage out and why. Zombie spends a lot of time talking about the challenges he faced on certain scenes. He also points out the new footage in this cut and why he put it back. The filmmaker delivers another solid commentary that is well worth a listen if you're a fan of this film.

The second disc starts of with 17 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Zombie. Unlike some auteurs, he is refreshingly ruthless with his footage and so we have a lot of scenes that were cut, including more of the strip club where Michael's mom works. There's also more of Loomis talking to a young Michael. Michael also attends a parole hearing that features a character played Tom Towles. Adrienne Barbeau even shows up briefly in a scene with Loomis. Zombie does a good job explaining why these scenes were cut.

Also included is an ""Alternate Ending"" with optional commentary by Zombie. This one is more sympathetic to Michael but wasn't satisfying enough for the director and he went with the other ending which is much more visceral.

""Bloopers"" features footage of McDowell cracking up with Sheri Moon Zombie take after take. It turns out that the veteran actor is a real goofball and looks like he's having a blast making his fellow actors laugh.

""The Many Masks of Michael Myers"" takes a look at how they constructed the iconic Michael Myers mask. They created several versions, including clean ones and then gradually grungy ones to symbolize the passage of time. We also see how the put together the various ones that Michael makes in the sanitarium.

""Re-Imagining Halloween"" is a three-part look at various aspects of the making of the film. Zombie wanted to shoot it in the style of 21 Grams and The Constant Gardener. He wanted the three acts to have their own distinctive looks: the first part was all hand-held cameras, the second was very static, and the third act used lots of steadicam work. The film's production design is examined. They take a look at the various sets and briefly talk about the specific look Zombie was after. The makeup effects are also featured. This involved a lot of work as Michael kills a lot of people. Zombie wanted them to look realistic and we see how some of the kills were done.

""Meet the Cast."" Zombie says that the casting process is the most exciting part of the filmmaking process for him because it is the first time the film feels real. He talks about why he cast the actors that he did and, in turn, they talk about their approach to the characters and a bit about working on the film.

""Casting Sessions"" is a collection of excerpts of audition footage of the cast members. It gives us a chance to see what convinced Zombie to hire them.

""Scout Taylor-Compton Screen Test"" features more footage of this young actress testing for the role of Laurie Strode. It is easy to see why she was cast as she nails the role.

2944586,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I liked it. I really did. I enjoyed it as a film. As an individual film, seperate from the rest. Sure, it wasn't perfect. It felt a little uneven in the middle. In other words, it seemed like each half of the film were really just shortened individual films that were put together to make a whole new one. Because of that, the remake phase was a tiny bit fast-paced for me. However, overall, I enjoyed it a great deal. There is a reason why, however, that is deeper than the film itself.

What Rob presented was a great film, that had a story that wasn't perfect. Therein lies the genius of it. It felt real. It didn't feel like a movie. While many will find that to make it a cluttered mess, it didn't for me. An example would be the way he presented Michael's victims. We didn't get to know them that well before he killed them. But when some serial killer kills a group of people, and it is announced on the news, what do you think the chances are that you know those people? You don't. And yet, it is still horrifying. In other words, you don't have to know the victims to understand how terrifying the crime is.

In a movie, you follow these people around, the camera being your eye as you stalk them invisibly. You really get to know the people. Here, by not following them, it presents that realism quite well. You don't know who these people are, but whether you know them or not, Michael Myers is still presented as a terrifying being. Speaking of ol' Mikey...

I thought Tyler and Daeg's performances were amazing. I loved how even though you could sympathize with him in his early life, it didn't change how bizzare, and truly evil he was. Right in the opening scenes, we see him petting a rat, and then we see moments later cleaning a bloody scalpel or something. Then, he tells his mother that his rat died. You know what he did. It's not that hard to figure out. What's great about this is that it shows that even though he had this terrible life, he didn't just snap over night. He's been going crazy for some time. The scene with the bully in the woods was powerful, at least for me. His eventual escape was equally amazing. How he took out those guards truly showed his power, and menace. I especially liked when he killed Ismael Cruz, because that was the indicator that the young boy that went into Smiths Grove was not the monster that walked out. To quote the original Doctor Loomis, ""That part of him died years ago."" Michael Myers in this film, as a character, was just as scary as he was in the original. The best Myers since Castle IMO.

Which brings me to another point that I really liked. I think that of all the actors who could have played Loomis, Rob really picked the right one, which was surely a difficult task. Sure, many suggested Anthony Hopkins, but (and I hate to say this) having played similar characters several times, he may have had a spirited performance, but he would have taken you out of the real world, and remind you that it was only a movie. Rob could have cast an actor that wasn't that well known, but then the performance would have been lacking, and have the same effect. With someone like McDowell, he has that face that is just obscure enough that you can buy him as a real person, yet he is also a great enough actor that he can still pull an amazing performance.

The rest of the cast was great as well. I really liked Harris as Annie, and Laurie was cast pretty well in my opinion. She acted like a real teenage girl. I would know, there's one next door, and then there's my younger sister. As for greeting each other with ""Hey, Bitches"" I think that was actually rather spot on. Real girls aren't like cartoon girls, or 7th Heaven characters, who go wide-eyed the moment someone uses a curse word.

Like I said, the film isn't perfect, but it was definately better than most, if not all of the sequels. As for how it measures up against the original, well, in terms of sheer quality, no, it wasn't better. But better isn't what they set out to do in the first place. I think this is the problem with most remakes. Many people who bash them believe that the initial concept is to make a better version. What Rob set out to do was make a Halloween that was just as good as the original, to make Michael Myers scary again, and at that he passed in flying colors. Sure, the original had good things that this film didn't have, but this film had good things that the original didn't have. They're different films, so you can't really judge them together. It's not a shot-for-shot remake, and it isn't a rehash either, so there's not much room to really compare everything. The only area where you can compare them is in the level of quality, and at that, they're at about the same level for me.

Will this film have a legacy like the original? No, probably not. The original Halloween made a legacy because it was a fresh concept, and the first true slasher. Yes, it could be said that the original Black Christmas is the father of Halloween (funny, huh?), but Halloween is the father of slasher films. Without it, there would be no Friday the 13th, no Prowler, no Nightmare on Elm Street, no Cropsy (The Burning), none of these characters and franchises would have been brought to life without the original Halloween. Now that the slasher genre has grown so much, this new Halloween can't really do the same thing that the original did. However, as is evident in the upcoming Friday the 13th, it does seem as though it may inspire one new trend: remakes that actually try hard to be good movies, rather than cash-ins.",1197763200,9,5574,4.400581959262851
2944587,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I have seen alot of remakes in my life but never have I seen one as great as this.  Nothing will compare to the original film, of course, however I love how it puts a fresh take on the story and adds some more detail to Michael Myers' childhood and what drove him to become what he is.  The movie keeps enough of the original concepts and characters to seem like a true remake but adds enough new material to make it interesting.  The original film focuses alot on the three teenage girls who are the main characters other then Michael, especially on Laurie Strode.  This film does not focus on them as much, but anyone who has seen the original really doesn't need those details.

Like everyone else, the main problem is that I must accept Michael Myers was a Kiss loving redneck with a stripper mother and a slutty sister. No one told Rob the secret of making a great movie: Less history, more mystery.. I understand what he's trying to do, but making him a moronic bloodthirsty killer is not his style, that's reserved for Jason Vorhees. This would've been a decent film if it had nothing to do with the Halloween franchise, but this one will be in the dollar bin soon enough, and we can all forget it ever happened.",1197590400,4,691,4.40625

Im a huge fan of the Halloween series and Rob stuck with the original story line and i liked how he added his own twist to it as well. This is now my favourite movie of all time!!! and if you don't agree well then I guess Rob Zombie did a good job scaring the hell out of you, and you must of ran outta the theatre crying for your mom, anyways way to go Rob, you've made a great remake!",1197417600,5,501,3.8737864077669903
2944590,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I am going to come right out and admit that I was extremely impressed with Rob Zombie's ""Halloween.""

His film has clearly already become the stuff of mass controversy. Most of that seemingly stems from the staunch defenders of John Carpenter's landmark original, who all curiously believe that Mr. Zombie has somehow committed a cardinal sin and defaced a highly revered genre classic. It was therefore understandable that I harbored some considerable degree of reluctance in voicing my own personal opinion. What, after all, could I possibly say in direct praise of Zombie's stellar achievement that would not automatically be meticulously scrutinized or dismissed? How many people would instantly and unfairly discredit my claim as a ""tried and true"" fan of horror simply because I dared to embrace a fresh angle on an already well established slasher?

To be quite honest, I no longer cling to such minor concerns. We, as people, can nitpick all we want. The fact is, Rob Zombie is an obvious fan of Carpenter's work and boasts a great deal of respect for the material. He has perfectly captured the brooding atmosphere and bone-chilling dread that was sorely lacking from the last several threadbare sequels. How this is such a bad thing in the eyes of certain fans, I will more than likely never fathom. This movie, in as much the same vein as Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" merely takes the premise of Carpenter's initial vision and steers it in a completely different direction. Michael Myers has finally once again become the same blood-curdling boogeyman he was nearly thirty years ago. This realization is mostly fueled by the refreshing backstory Zombie has provided us within his film's opening act. Some viewers I have noticed seem to take issue with the whole ""white trash"" approach Zombie applies to Michael's family. But, from where I stand, it works. I base that conclusion around two supporting factors, the first of which concerns Michael's subdued portrayal in Carpenter's film. While he certainly was a very formidable and sinister presence, I always still found him altogether empty and one dimensional. There was no meat on his bones, no real motive behind his heinous crimes aside from what Dr. Loomis presumed was just ""pure evil."" That was always the one key gripe I had with Carpenter's vision, and it was also something I was more than delighted to see Rob Zombie address here so many years later. My second point deals more specifically with the fleshing out of Michael's family. I found this incredibly effective and had absolutely no problem with the bold liberties Zombie took by making Ronnie White, Michael's overly abusive and potty-mouthed stepfather, so utterly and ferociously loathsome. We may not want to admit it, but people of this wretched caliber do exist within our society. Whether such horrific conduct can ultimately drive somebody to mass murder can certainly be contested. Although, for the purpose of this totally fictional horror movie, I seriously believe it was a plot device that worked sheer wonders.

As the movie segues back to Haddonfield in its second half, as most anyone already knows, Zombie shifts gears with a wonderfully nostalgic updating of ""Mr. Sandman"" and revisits more familiar territory with scenes lifted almost letter perfectly from the 1978 original. He takes us back to the same West Hollywood streets Carpenter utilized for his shoot and gives us a Haddonfield that, in many of the same ways, actually feels like an average everyday midwest american neighborhood. The set dressing and overall attention to detail is absolutely amazing!

I also rather quite liked the casting. Malcolm McDowell, the new Dr. Loomis, openly admitted that he never actually viewed any of the prior films. He was apparently discouraged from doing so by Zombie, himself, who did not wish to see a carbon copy of the Donald Pleasance portrayal. Donald's contribution to the original series, it goes without saying, will always remain legendary. But, I do have to say that I found much to enjoy with Malcolm's spin on the character, as well. The same can also easily be said for Daeg Faerch and Tyler Mane, the actors behind Michael's two respective personas. I was especially taken by the emotional range young Faerch brought to Michael's childhood. He displayed great depth in a role that, as I have already outlined, did not previously offer it. And Tyler Mane is plain and simply awe-inspiring! I won't say anything outside the simple fact that I feel he is the single greatest actor to don the Michael Myers mask since Nick Castle. He really is that good and gives Michael a raw savagery he hasn't had in years!

I have long since read up on all the many bonus features supplied within the forthcoming ""unrated"" DVD release. You can rest assured that I will most definitely be adding it to my collection.

Okay, so, having voiced all of this, I must now unfortunately and very briefly touch upon a matter that I personally would rather not. That would entail most of the highly unnecessary and heated backlash I've seen dished out in recent months against the varying slasher fans who favored this particular production. The Carpenter purists can spout all the negativity they want about Rob Zombie. I have never seen his prior films, so I have nothing further to judge him by. People mostly tend to forget that he never claimed to be ""remaking"" John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Zombie specifically stated, from day one, that he was putting his own unique stamp on this time-honored film and that is precisely what he has done. That is predominantly why this movie is called Rob Zombie's ""Halloween."" The fact that any one person enjoys this new film does not make them any less a true fan of John Carpenter's original. I find the idea that so many others vehemently disagree with that sentiment as laughable as it is pathetic. But, hey, so is the world we live in at times.

Go figure.

It's a slasher movie, not a political statement. Watch it, have fun with it, and appreciate it for what it is....a well-crafted and worthy companion piece to John Carpenter's classic.",1197331200,8,6130,4.933139534883721
2944591,5,B000VKL6Z2,"The original Halloween is a classic and will in my book always receive a five star rating. Recently there has been a great deal of remakes that were flops and catered to the teeny bopper crowd such as, The Fog, The Omen, Dark Water, etc.  However there has been only two remakes that I thought were diserving of our attenion, one being the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, and Halloween.

What I liked about the remake was it gave us something fresh to work with.  In the original Halloween we never really knew why Michael was bad, in this remake, the first thirty minutes or so expore the childhood of Michael Myers.  People say that the dialog concerning Michael's family was wrong.  Trust me, I have seen broken homes and Mr. Zombie gives us exactly what you would expect from a trashy family.

Besides satisfying my curiosity of Michael's childhood, I found this to be similar in many cases to the original, but at the same time the material was quite fresh with new chills and scares.  Zombie took a masterpiece and reminded us why it is called a masterpiece.  He accomplished a great job capturing a 70's look and theme, and did a great musical score as well.

It's got everything I and II have - storyline, atmosphere, incredible camera work, and brilliant lighting. The films that SHOULD be scorned are H20 and Resurrection.

Seeing him as a child was a treat, thus making the ending heartfelt. Im not saying you actually care for him, but you now have an understanding of him, and see it was out of his hands. All you fanboys out there need to grow up, and open your eyes!",1197158400,3,554,4.388349514563107
2944597,2,B000VKL6Z2,"You know you're watching a Rob Zombie film by the amount of facial hair, verbal abuse, domestic squalor and bar brawl ballads peppering the scenes. And ""Halloween"" doesn't disappoint in the opening act, with the stripper mom tossing breakfast plates at her deadbeat significant other, who in the space of less than a minute belittles an infant and lusts after the underage whore daughter. I call it Jerry Springer noir.

But when, soon after, young Michael Myers is shuffling from room to room mechanically killing everyone in his home on Halloween night, the action lacks tension. At which time I realized that without suspense, murder scenes come off as clinical, no more heart-racing than a knee operation. That wouldn't be so bad if, in between the psycho surgery, there was a healthy dose of witty, nihilistic hillbilly banter. But you get lines like, ""I know I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday"" that belong in intentionally stupid films like ""Snakes on a Plane.""

I was expecting Zombie to transport the Myers clan to the pork-fried South setting of his earlier films -- with haunted houses staffed by double-headed nuclear fallout survivors, day-glo basilisks and scuba-suited big-rig drivers high on meth and gasoline. The only actor who earns his paycheck actually is a trucker by the name of Big Joe Grizzley (Ken Foree), but he's rubbed out a few blinks after he's introduced -- although his outfit continues in his stead. The kid (Daeg Faerch) looks the part but his acting prep seemed to consist primarily of swigging 'Tussin a half-hour before someone yelled, ""Action."" Zombie broods over young Michael for such a significant amount of time that by the end, you're left wondering why he bothered at all when, just as in the original, Michael turns out to be no more than a mindless beast.

In an interview with Premiere before the film's release, Zombie compared the legend of Michael Myers to the ""Frankenstein"" story, itself based on Prometheus, giving John Carpenter's franchise much more credit than it deserves. But he goes on to say, ""My movie takes place as if no other movies ever existed. It's not connected to anything,"" a baffling statement because when ""Halloween's"" perspective switches from Michael to other characters in the ""present-day"" portion of the film, scenes looks as if they were lifted straight from the Carpenter version. This seems to be nothing more than an assignment to see if Zombie is ready for the washed-out big leagues.",1197158400,3,2473,4.968599033816425
2944598,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a great movie and is scary as hell. It's a remake to John Carpenters classic Halloween which came out in 1978. This movie starts out pretty by exploring more as to what drove Michael in to turning into a psycopatic killer. They basically show us how his relationships with his mother, stepfather, and sister which were not good at all aside from the mother. Michael being bullied at school also did not help.  Michael finally snapps from all of this and goes trick or treating. Malcolm Mcdowell plays Dr. Samual Loomis who tries to help the young Michael who is locked up at Smith Grove for the next 15 years. Then we move to Michael who is now grown up and doesn't talk at all. Loomis finally gives up on him because hes see no hope for helping him at all and moves on and writes a book on Michael. Michael of course escapes. Dr Loomis gets a call that he has escaped.  He knows where he is going to and tries to do anything to help and to stop him because he knows how dangerous he is. After this the second part of the movie beginns which is very similar to Carpentors except more gorier, more death scenes, and too much nudity.  Laurie and her friends are stalked by Michael and we also see Laurie's adoptive parents in this film. The movie moves pretty quickly from here where Michael goes trick or treating again and will kill anybody to get to her baby sister Laurie. It's very suspensful full and action packed so I won't give it away. Some of the bonus materials on the second disv which I found interesting were the deleted scenes, alternate ending, some parts of how the movie was made. Other bonus materials which people would find interesting are the bloopers, and the casting sessions. Overall I highly recommend this movie!!",1197072000,,1747,4.470219435736677

What set this movie apart from many of the other horror movies was that there were some actual story here, an explanation as to why Myers turned out like he did. There were some parts that were predictable, but there were also some parts that really made me jump. I rated this with only four stars because there was a little too much nudity. Sadly enough, there will always be the obligatory nudie scene, but Zombie went over the top on this one. I would recommend the DVD and a fast forward button when they show. As per usual, they don't add anything to the movie, only detract. If you can live with that though, this movie will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.",1196812800,3,777,4.328767123287672

This prequel/re-imaging had one fantastic scene during the first 10 minutes, and then it just fell apart and was exposed for the train wreck die hard Halloween fans were certain it would be.
  Michael myers now comes from a white trash family complete with an abusive pedophile stepfather. His sister a trash talking whore.(the whole family is trash talking) A pole dancing mother who was actually
redeemable(somewhat) and played very well by Zombie's wife. Malcolm McDowell has none of the hypnotic effect that the late Donald Pleasance had as DR. Sam Loomis. The grown Myers is an incredible bulk with catchers mits as hands, and just lumbers his way through this. The second re-imaging half just moves along at a frantic pace with no suspense or atmosphere, and is hardly frightening in the least. Many parts were laughed at in the theatre I was in.
  Trying to remake a classic timeless masterpiece of filmaking is like trying to change the laws of physics, it can't be done, and could actually be quite dangerous if tried.

2944601,4,B000VKL6Z2,"And make no bones about it, the original masterpiece by John Carpenter did NOT need to be remade, however; this does go to show that on occasion, given some style and a slightly different approach, a remake can work (hey Hollywood, originality works even better!).  I begrudgingly went to see this (a friend offered me a free ticket so...), more out of curiosity and an urge to back up my preconceived notions that this would be utter garbage, rather than for enjoyment or entertainment purposes.  So just imagine my suprise when by the end of the film I was as giddy as a junior highschool boy with a pack of cigarettes and a porno magazine!  Director Rob Zombie actually brings enough unique and original material to the Michael Myers mythos that we understand (kinda) why he becomes what he ultimately becomes... an awesome and unstoppable killing machine!  Oddly enough though, this also works as a detracting factor, because although Rob does a nice job showing us an origin for one of the best (if not THE greatest) slasher icons of all time (which TCM: The Begining was completely inept at doing), in the end though, I still feel it was much creepier knowing less rather than more.  In Carpenter's original, Michael looks like a normal kid from a normal middle class family and you never know or understand why he did what he did on that fateful Halloween night... while in Zombie's version, Michael comes from a bad white trash family and is constantly under verbal and physical abuse from those around him.  Not nearly as suprising or shocking when he does finally lose it, in fact you end up almost rooting for him to let loose.  The movie provides considerably enough new material that if Rob had decided to rename the characters and change Myers into some other distinctive madman of his own creation he probably could have had an exciting new slasher franchise on his hands... but instead he put his own spin on Halloween, and he did a nice job of it.  Acting is top notch throughout (if not a little over done at times) and the killings are as realistic and brutal as I've seen in awhile (including a cringe worthy baseball bat to the head... several times!), plus thankfully Carpenter's original score also returns for some scenes.  This version is actually sleazier and more exploitative than the original (much like the equally excellent ""Hills Have Eyes"" remake was) and pushes the language, nudity, and graphic content way past it's predecessor (which the original didn't need to be a great movie but...) and helps it to stand on it's own two blood stained boots.  Not being particullarly fond of either Rob Zombie as a director OR remakes says quite allot for the film, and I've rarely had a better time watching a movie while simutaneously being transformed into a hypocrite!  I'd recommend this to any and all horror fans, not everyone will like it, but you might be suprised at how many of you will.  Also keep and eye out for the always great Ken Foree (original Dawn Of The Dead, From Beyond) as trucker Joe Grizzly in my favorite scene from the movie which features him on the toilet doing battle with a taco salad and Michael Myers (no really...

When I first heard that Rob Zombie would be doing a ""re-imagining"" of Carpenters original, I was, well, scared a little. I could deal with a sequel being bad, but going back and tampering with what made Michael Myers such a horror icon is pretty risky. After viewing the 11:00 show last night with a sold out crowd, I can tell you that Zombie sure did tamper with the movie. Hell, he gave it over a half-hour of insight into why Michael's childhood caused him to become a masked killer. In my opinion, it paid off. What made the original so great was the mystery of Michael Myers, you really had no idea why he did what he did and that made it creepier. What sets the tone of Zombie's version is how in your face the details of this kid are, its to the point where you are forced to feel creeped out, as if someone tied you down to the chair. After the insight and the institution days (which in my opinion, brilliantly tie some knots that Halloween fans should be pleased with) the movie cuts right to the chase, having an aura of the original and a fresh new feel at the same time. I do not want to give away any deaths (although I will say they are GRUESOME and mostly terrifying), big details or the ending, which some idiotic IMDb users do, but I can tell you that the twists in this film, especially towards the end will totally catch you off guard. As for the style of the film, I personally like Zombie's directing style, I think its unique and very much his and I was happy that he wasn't trying to copy Carpenter like so many other past directors have tried to with the Halloween Sequels. The casting was for the most part top notch. Expect to see some heavy hitters in the genre in little bit parts through out the film. To wrap this up, I was very pleased. The film screams at you, its right in your face whether you want it to be or not. If you can let your guard down and stop being so defensive of the original, you should enjoy yourself as much as I did.

This is all the more vital if one is going to tribute film patriarchs. Gus van Sant's version of Psycho is still contentious--an egotistical blasphemy as far as some buffs are concerned. Tom Savini's remake of Night of the Living Dead seems largely ignored, while Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is really a dumb Americanization of 28 Days Later. Important considerations if one presumes to remake that daddy of slasher films, Halloween.

Independent film master John Carpenter gave us the original, from a screenplay co-written with Debra Hill, and possibly inspired by Black Christmas. Dimension Films acquired the rights and after a string of terrible sequels, began looking to reboot the series. Along comes Rob Zombie.

Up front, forget this noise about ""re-envisioning,"" or ""remakes for a new generation"". I only care about good movies. Movies that love themselves and their audiences too. With an exception or two, Halloween is such a slasher movie.

Mainly because Zombie chucks out the supernatural canards in favor of a true crime sensibility. Nuts to that stuff about the curse of Samhain. The real horror comes from a dirt head little boy in a Kiss shirt, who takes enough abuse with too little love to become a psychopath. The first half of the movie charts Michael Meyer's transition into murder, complete with screaming parents, indifferent siblings, and schoolyard bullies. By the time school authorities discover evidence of the boy's madness, things become famously, dramatically too late.

Plenty of horror movies have a vignette or a toss-away speech to explain their villains. Rob Zombie spends two whole acts to show how Meyers is shaped by his environment to become The Shape. Along these lines he develops actual relationships between the killer and other people: notably that of his mother, a janitor, and Dr. Sam Loomis. The mother and doctor in particular play much longer and deeper roles than in the original film, contributing greatly to my interest. But even the sister and father get more screen time and development in terms of Michael's growing addiction to death.

That Zombie fills in gaps is another mark of the film's quality. We see when Michael finally crosses the line from a troubled boy to a speechless murder machine. How he escapes imprisonment. How Meyers acquires his mask and coveralls. How he knows to stalk the virgin babysitter Laurie and her not-so-virgin friends.

And stalk he does. For Zombie's vision is dark, literally as well as figuratively. A selective use of slow motion, sound effects, and low-end rhythms in the soundtrack evoke night-time terrors even during the day. It makes heavy use of source lighting to create thick shadows. For that matter, a lot of the sound is source-based too, and Zombie sometimes uses deep throated sirens or high pitched baby screams as a substitute for ambient music. The film itself is saturated to emphasize dark colors, and even broad daylight looks as if shot through a grimy window.

The blood is dark red to black, which probably helped this movie get an ""R"" instead of an ""NC-17"". It also helps that, as usual for horror movies, most of The Shape's victims are unsympathetic--it's always okay to kill cops, abusive dads, truckers, and sluts in the movies.  And as usual, we don't see the death of animals or little kids. We even get the old clich' of a loathsome punk being killed, to foreshadow another character's prowess. I don't knock the movie much for this, though, because *Halloween* comes from that sort of tradition. The most ""innocent"" victims are still portrayed as schmucks, and indeed one of the recurrent themes in Rob Zombie movies is that the public is too naive and ill-equipped to deal with psychos.

Speaking of violence and themes, Zombie eschews the current trend in dismemberments and arterial sprays. He also avoids the 1980's trend of lingering on the murder weapon as if it were a phallus. Instead, Mike Meyers lands fierce, rapid blows; he does not stab so much as bludgeon. And while he does not torture his victims, they die more painfully and terror-stricken than in *Hostel*. Because where Zombie does linger is the moment of expiration, and so *Halloween* is a death fan's delight. People gurgle and twitch in bathtub-sized pools of blood, as their killer looks them in their bulging eyes... Typically, the majority of time the camera skips over a death scene is when the victim is an animal.

Indeed, the one big sin of this film is not brutality, but boredom. The Shape kills at least 21 characters before I lost count, most of them extras or cameos. I began to tire around 17. The pursuit of the Laurie character dragged further, with multiple escapes and captures and false deaths. I never got the sense that Zombie was aware of how much the story dragged in the last half-hour, and I can think of at least three murders scenes he could have shaved to improve the pace.

So I liked the first half of the movie, which consisted mainly of original material and real shocks, than the more derivative second. Otherwise, it's a damn sight better than any other horror remake I've seen. Most of them suck because they are produced or filmed by people with no competency or love for the source material.

Like Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth, Rob Zombie combines a respect for his roots with the ability to apply them. The result is a remake that becomes its own classic.",1196294400,,5591,4.853095487932844

And to this day, it's the only horror movie that scares me every time I watch it. So when I heard Rob Zombie was doing a reimagining (NOT A REMAKE!) I was a little apprehensive but optimistic.
I thought it was a damn good horror movie. But not as scary as the original. Which is fine, seeing as it's not a remake. It was gory enough for me. I actually liked the main character (Laurie), which is rare in horror movies these days. The only complaint I really have with this movie is that Mike Myers was too big and strong. But on the whole, the movie was exactly what I was expecting it to be.",1196294400,3,698,3.9574468085106385
2944619,4,B000VKL6Z2,"As a true long-time fan of the original Carpenter ""Halloween"", and a true skeptic of most of the current remakes of classics, I was a little hesitant about wanting to see this remake.  However, knowing that if I disliked it I could just erase it from memory, I went in to the theater to see this with an open mind.  I also kept in mind that as long as the original is still available to be seen, it DOESN'T MATTER if the remake was not up to par.  The original is still there to be seen.  I have to say that after seeing Rob Zombie's vision of this story, I was blown away.  I was a huge fan of ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"", and was definitely NOT disappointed in the re-imagining of the Michael Myers story.

That being said, I have to say I honestly do not know what people who loathe this reinvention expected.  There is such hatred towards this movie that I do not understand.  If anyone has seen any of Rob Zombie's previous works, they should have known going in that this was going to be a BRUTAL and graphically realistic movie.  The comparisons to Carpenter's building of suspense are baffling....Zombie is known for the more ""in your face"" brutality and edginess...nothing else should have been expected.

If you're familiar with Zombie's previous works, you will love this movie.  If you want the more subtle, subdued suspense that the 1978 original offered (which I also loved), then this is probably not the movie for you.  However, if you've not seen the Rob Zombie ""Halloween"", please do not post a negative review just on what you've heard or what you've felt about the remake UNLESS you HAVE seen it.  I feel there are a lot of posts on here from people who haven't seen it and just want to give it negative reviews based on the fact that they are upset that a remake of the classic was done.",1196208000,10,1831,4.429850746268657
2944620,1,B000VKL6Z2,"For one, I am a big fan of the original. I think it's a masterpiece. Michael Myers, as a character, truly scares the crap out of me. When I heard Zombie was going to do a remake of this classic, at first I was appalled, but then I saw the Devil's Rejects and my apprehensions were quickly allayed. Then the trailer came out in the spring, after seeing that... Halloween(2007) quickly became my most anticipated movie of the year over everything else.

Aug 31st rolls around, I catch the midnight show, the theatre is packed and pumped for a good scarin'... ten minutes roll by and my head is ringing with the words 'oh no, this can't be happening.' The first hour rolls by and I'm slumping in my seat, thinking there might be some hope. The 90 minute mark rolls by and my hand is covering my mouth, not by the terror of what's unfolding on screen, but by the stark realization that I'm probably watching the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The credits pop up and my jaw just hits the floor at the stench of awfulness this movie exudes.

Piss poor direction. Piss poor acting from everyone(I'm talking to you Malcolm McDowell) involved. Piss poor writing. Piss poor cinematography. Not only is this movie poorly made, but it's just not scary... AT ALL!!!!!

What makes this movie tragic is the fact that Rob Zombie is a 42 year old horror junkie who has been around the block. In his interviews he seems like a guy who knows what he's talking about. You would think his life experience would translate into a piece of work that was unique. Not so.

And for those who support this flick then I have to come to the conclusion that 1) You don't know anything about Horror movies. 2)You really don't know anything about Horror movies. 3) You TRULY don't know anything about Horror movies.

Rob Zombie, in my mind, has made the first Horror movie for the mentally challenged. It's akin to watching a fecal clogged toilet bowl in a grimy public restroom. This movie could actually be a litmus test for judging one's character.

Yet I encourage everyone to see it if they're interested in filmmaking as a cautionary tale of what not to do when crafting a story. It's toxic ineptitude almost has to be seen to be believed. You were warned.",1196208000,15,2239,4.488943488943489

History:

I am one of the originals who saw the birth of Michael Myers in the theatre. The first has been and always will be the best. I was not thrilled with 2. I thought 4 was a great return but 5 crash and burned. 6 I felt was pretty good but the shadow of Donald dying while making the film made it a little sad to watch. 7 went back to basics. I liked it. 8 was a joke.

I own a Michael Myers outfit that I wear every year. Michael in his own way has become part of my mythology.

When they announced the restart I was furious. I wanted to burn Hollywood down. Then they named Rob Zombie to helm the film and I took a step back. I have always preached that the only good restarts were made by those who has a true love of the original. Rob Zombie is one of those artists.

So in trying to keep a level head I saw the film.

Unfortunately:

My viewing of the film was damaged by two idiots who kept talking on their cell phone and the theatre lights came on before the movie was over so I will be seeing this movie again.

My review of the film is slow in coming because I really wanted to sit back and think about the film. Not rush to any judgements.

The Review:

I really liked what I saw.

As a filmmaker Rob Zombie is truly growing. After viewing The Devil's Rejects I compared his style to Sam Peckinpah. Never playing it safe. In your face with the violence. And most important, great script and well-defined characters.

No matter how small the role you remember who each character is. What they do. Their personality. Even if they are on the screen for just 2 minutes you remember them. This is a great gift to scripting.

Another thing Rob Zombie excels at is film score. The music he chooses enhances the scene. Never commands it. I did like how he used cuts from the first Halloween and Halloween 4.

The camera and cinematography was gritty matching the feel.

The cast was excellent. The ones that really stood out were:

Sheri Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers (Michael's Mother). She gave a depth to her performance that I really have not seen from her before. Very sad as the mother trying to keep her family together.

Daeg Faerch as young Michael. He changes from child to monster were outstanding.

William Forsythe as Ronnie White (Deborah Myers live in abusive boyfriend). This man could make a monster out of a nun.

Danny Trejo as Ismael Cruz (Hospital Worker). You felt his caring and fear of Michael.

As for the main two characters:
Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Samuel Loomis: The character was totally rewritten. Which to me was a good thing. Donald Pleasence had created a tortured Ahab hunting down the evil that he felt only he understood. I could not see anyone going in the same direction and giving the character justice. What Rob did and Malcolm gave a very good performance with was making Loomis more of a researcher. An explorer of the mind. New ways to cure. As the film went along Loomis could see more and more the primeval force inside Michael. And towards the end he realizes the great error he made in how to handle Michael which I will talk about later.

Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. Tyler has been around for a few films but he may have finally made his mark with Michael. He let his presence speak for him. He did not over due the role. I will easily rank him as one of the best to portray Michael Myers.

The script:

My first thought after the film was ""This ain't your Daddy's Halloween"". Rob Zombie made a wise move in not trying to duplicate the original but instead made his own mark on the legend. Yes. It is grittier and bloodier then the first and surprisingly I did not have a problem with that. There was a method to anyone Michael killed. A reason behind every action. Not just some random body count. To Michael, those he killed were not innocent.

Another wise move was to base the whole film on Michael. In the original we had Dr. Loomis and the three babysitters as the main focus with Michael always being in the background. Again, to try to base the film on the originals would have been disappointing. Instead we get a full look at Michael. What drove him. His reasons. His rage. The one downside to this is you loose the mystique of Michael. But Rob only has one unused direction to take this film and so that had to be sacrificed. What we do get in its place is an unstoppable force of rage. In this film Michael is the purest form of Monster in human form.

As for what drove him. I am fascinated by his psychological reasons to the killing. From the school bully to the hatred of his sister and her flaunting the sex. The whole family slaughter was based on his love for his mother and baby sister. He systematically removed everything that prevented him from having a happy family life. His mother and baby sister were literally the only two women that could be in Michael's life. All others reminded him of his older sister.

I really enjoyed the way the masks were used in the film. Thinking that he was hiding the ugly when in fact the mask was enhancing the monster in him.

Another drive to Michael which fueled his rage and I really wonder if anyone else picked up on this, was his abandonment. People he loved were leaving him. His mother's death. Dr. Loomis giving up and leaving after they had built this strange friendship. Ismael Cruz retiring from the hospital. The only worker that had treated Michael with respect. Which all lead up to the rage that erupted when he finally confronted his sister without his mask and then her trying to kill him. Everything he was. Everything he did lead up to that key moment. She was all he had left and she rejected him destroying any hope for Michael.

The film left the door wide open for a sequel. It will be interesting what direction they go for next.

I give it a 4 out of 5 and consider it a very worthy companion to the Halloween films.",1196035200,7,5896,4.358904109589041
2944622,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been a die hard fan of the classic for a long time (ever since I saw it during its broadcast debut on NBC in 1981).  However, I say, without shame, that I like this reimaging.  I say reimaging rather than remake because it was intended to be a different movie than the original.  I love the fact that they spent more time on young Michael, and the actor that portrayed him did a wonderful job.  There was a creepy yet sympathetic element to his performance, not unlike Sissy Spacek's role in Carrie.  The casting of the giant Tyler Mane was also a good move.  He towered over everyone and the scenes in the institution with the orange mask were chilling.  Alot of people missed the point of some of the plot changes, but, to me, that is what made the movie good.

I will say if you go into this movie expecting a classic on par with John Carpenter's film, you may be disappointed.  If you go into this movie with an open mind, you may enjoy it more.  Do not go into it ready to pick out the differences, if so you will miss the point of the film entirely.  It is more brutal and has more nudity and profanity than the original,so be prepared for that.

The bottom line is that I liked it.  It is not John Carpenter's Halloween, it's Rob Zombie's Halloween.  If you want to see the classic, then watch the original.  If you want to see a reimaging, then watch the new version.  The choice is yours.",1195948800,11,1404,4.241509433962264
2944623,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's re-visioning of the original classic 'Halloween' completely strips it of what it once was and stood for.  Our pal Michael was a silent, stealthy, suspenseful and tricky lad back in the day, hiding in the shadows and laying traps for his victims.  Back then, he represented a more subtle horror icon over his buddies Jason and Freddy.
Enter the new Michael, complete with a back story.  Zombie paints a killer whose redneck family abused him and whose young compassion is stripped by seemingly mindless violence.  The mystery behind Michael is completely thrwarted by Zombie, who feels it necessary to expose Michael as an everyday human being, unlike Carpenters 'The Child is just plain evil' theory.
Twelve or thirteen killings later, we have the older Michael, built like  WWF wrestler and a senseless killing machine.  Murder, sex, murder, cameo, murder, sex, murder, etc.  Blah, blah, blah.  Timing is terrible in this movie and there is no suspense.  You know everyone is going to die and you don't care about any of them.  Michael becomes a bore and laughable as well.  The old bush scene and laundry line scene are replaced by myers just standing around in broad daylight while the three young girls look across the street at him.
The ending is hardly memorable and the movie overall is a complete mess.  I liked some things about the rawness of 'House of 1,000 Corpses' and the 'Devils Rejects', but this film has nothing to borrow from them and ends up killing a classic.  It's a good slasher film if you can forget everything you know about Michael Myers and Halloween.  I, unfortunately, cannot easily forget.  And I will not forgive Mr. Zombie for such a worthless, effortless and talent-less re-visioning of an immortal horror classic.  If you can't stick to the basics of good horror, such as suspense, sympathy for the characters and overall intrigue, stick to music or your infamous 'Texas Chainsaw', um, I mean 'Devil's Rejects'movies.",1195948800,15,1965,4.927051671732523
2944624,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is another classic hit remade by Rob Zombie.  I've noticed in all of his films he carries his cast around; this one, House of a 1000 Corpses, Devil's Rejects... they all seem to play a vital role.  I like the back story to Michael Myers that Rob Zombie came up with.  It's very important to establish where or how someone became who they are today and I think Rob did a nice job in showing us why Michael is Michael.  His home life not being so great, his mother played by none other than Sheri Moon (Rob's wife) is a exotic dancer, the father figure is a pig, and his sister is your normal average teenage daughter... it's like what a life.

On another note, I don't know if any one was aware that the character Annie Brackett, Lori Strodes best friend is played by none other than Danielle Harris who also plays as young Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.  At first glance she was just another Hollywood face but when I looked closer I noticed that she played the little girl in 4 & 5 that was out at the farm house where there was the party and people were being killed one by one.  It's kind of ironic that Zombie would pick her, knowing she had a history with Halloween.  Plus for her to be killed and pratically nude in the 2007 movie, shows that closure was needed somehow.  But that's my opinion.

All and all, I enjoyed this horror flick.... as I am a HORROR Lover.  It's very hard to find horror movies so moving to slasher flicks is the next best move.",1195516800,2,1536,4.2620689655172415

I thought it was silly to remake such an iconic film. and a film in which the series is still carrying on. But, I saw it in theatres the day it came out and LOVED it. It was great in it's own way. A great companion piece to the original. Scout Taylor-Compton did a fantastic job as Laurie. Her acting and her fear and her screma were all very realistic and natural.

2944636,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Wow! After reading the previous reviews, you would have thought this film is to blame for the rise of Nazi Germany. So much hate for a fictional story. I would like to express my opinion of the movie. First, I was eight when the original came out and was probably ten or eleven when I saw it for the first time. I was horrified, but it has become one of my favorite horror films. It is a classic, and probably will always be the best one. Over the years as greedy producers tried to squeeze every penny out of this franchise, the quality of the movies has dropped. No version will ever cause the tension and fear of the original. But with all the sequels, some large holes in the story were created. This movie at least gets the whole Laurie Strode story in order instead of the original, making us wonder why he singled her out. This gives him a purpose to come back. I loved the fact that so much time was used showing Michael develop. The whole ""born-evil"" is fine, but give him a reason to snap. I like the fact you can see him grow into this monster, and feel that maybe, if he had a ""normal"" family, they could have stopped him. It makes him more of a tragic character, instead of a one dimentional horror mold. You get to see him evolve into what he becomes, from killing small rats, to his family. I love the way you see him evolve at the institution. Becoming silent, and then the fixation with the masks. It helps define him. Then he escapes and the rest of the movie follows the original without all the dragging. (It does drag in some places.) And Dr Loomis is more of a real character. Selfish and looking out for himself. (You also don't have the over-the-top acting. ""Death has come to your town Sheriff"".  And if you don't understand the whole kneeling and acting submissive to Lorie, it was because she was the only person he ever loved and when he was locked up as a child and still talked, all he ever wanted, was to go home. So he went home and brought her there so they could be a family. Then she stabbed him and he lost any good still in him and went ""to the dark side"" (I'm surprised no one accused zombie of ripping-off Star Wars #3) Again, I love the original and no movie under the name ""Halloween"" will EVER be as good. But this is a re-telling through Zombie's eyes, and I like the fact he gives us more of a back story and shows us the evolution of the Michael Myers character. It shouldn't be the same as the original. But it pays tribute to the original, with a modern edge. (Kevin Smith doing a remake of Goodfellas would be very different from the original) So please, give the movie a chance. Let it stand on it's own without constant comparison to the original. And I'm not a ""Horror Professor"", but I watch a lot of Horror films, and nothing could be worse than Busta saying, ""Trick or treat, mother f'er!"" as he Kung-fu's Michael.",1194998400,14,2868,4.291512915129151

2944641,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been a fan of the horror genre since I was young.  As a teenager, friends and I would sometimes pull all-night horror marathons and have a blast.  It was never the mindless slasher nonsense that drew us in, but the smart, well-crafted films with both suspense and true scares.  The list that meet these criteria is a short one, ranging from the original Exorcist from 1973 to modern classics like Session 9 and even May.  Some of our most cherished, however, have been part of the Halloween series.

John Carpenter's original Halloween and Rick Rosenthal's respectable sequel are both classic greats in the horror world.  Most of the sequels that followed were questionable at best.  And when something is done well, imitation is expected.  Countless film makers have tried to compete with the likes of Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street or Alien.  Naturally, almost none of the films these have inspired turned out to be memorable.  But then a terrible thing happened in 1998 that opened a door that never should have been opened.  They remade Psycho.  Those of you who watched Gus Van Sant's film know what it was.  It was a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece as well as to audiences everywhere.  It was an attempt to bring the greatest psychological thriller in cinema history to a whole new generation.  And why did it fail so miserably?  Was it the director?  The actors?  The script (which was almost word-for-word the original)?  No.  It failed because you can't remake a classic.  That is precisely what makes them classics.

When the previews for a Halloween remake directed by Rob Zombie came out, I was really excited.  Having bought both House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, I had a fair amount of faith in Zombie's ""new take on a classic legend.""  Zombie has proved to be a man willing and unafraid to push the limits in both music and movies far past what regular (read: boring) audiences are used to.  So I watched it.  I was intrigued.  I kept watching.  Pretty different alright, I thought.  But as the movie went on, and differences mounted, I began to feel a little discouraged.  Was I just watching another bad slasher movie?  The f-bomb was being used way to much, everyone the killer saw was being slaughtered, the nudity was needlessly excessive and the only suspense came from wondering when and if it would get better.  It didn't.  Rob Zombie pillaged Carpenter's legacy by turning a scary story into a run-of-the-mill piece of trash no different from the likes of Wrong Turn or Rest Stop.

Trust me.  Trust me.  Rob Zombie is still cool and I will certainly not allow this one failure to keep me from checking out his next project.  I gave Halloween 2 stars instead of 1 because, hey, he tried.  But Beware.  This movie will disappoint anyone looking for more than just blood and guts.

2944644,1,B000VKL6Z2,"John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" works brilliantly on so many levels.
Rob Zombie's update has succeeded in mangling virtually every element, to the point that there isn't a single thing right in it.

I'll first address those who rail against we who post negative critiques, saying that we just need an open mind and we need to be willing to see a new interpretation:
Bull.
I have no problem with new interpretations as a concept, but a classic of the genre, a film that is one of the pinnacles of suspense horror deserves a better turn that to be ""re-envisioned"" into this execrable waste.

Let's start picking:

The backstory - way, WAY too long, for starters.  I guess it's possible that it could have been more stereotypical and less intersting, but off hand I can't imagine how.  Okay, so we all now know that abusive and dysfunctional upbringing can lead to torture of small animals, which is a warning sign that the subject may tend towards homicidal tendencies as an adult.  Got it.  Thanks.  Do we really need to spend 60% of the film hashing this out?

Plus, the grossest flaw of this backstory is that it belittles and de-mystifies the character of Michael Meyers entirely, not to mention that the terribly inappropriate casting of Tyler Mane doubles this damage.

Why is he doing these things?  What drives his evil?  How is he so physically powerful for having the build of anybody else?  How the hell can he sit up and keep coming after having a knitting needle rammed into his throat?  According to the 1978 original, we'll never know, and that's why he's scary.
`The Shape', the creepy guy in the overalls with the cheesy mask, could have been anybody.  He grew up in an apparently normal household, showed no signs of danger right up until he put the knife to his sister and her boyfriend.  As an adult, he's not physically remarkable in any way.  Just an average guy.  There is no reason or explanation for his murderous ways, he simply does it, and that's all that needs to be known.  And the fact that he doesn't seem remotely excited or amped up about doing what he's doing - he just does his thing.  He simply IS the Boogeyman.

By showing us a kid who was almost engineered to be a psycho-killer, and having him grow up to be that huge, it's obvious that he's a juggernaut of mayhem.  Of course, a knitting needle to the throat isn't going to put him down, and it's a reasonable assumption that he'll take more bullets than any gun can carry before he'll start showing any effect.  The fact that he flies into violent rages diminishes him, too.  Of course, I'd be scared if that monster was coming at me.  I'd be scared if I was staked out on a railroad track with the daily freight bearing down on me - doesn't necessarily mean that it will make for good entertainment; nor does it mean that it's appropriate in a movie that should play up vaguely supernatural associations with the date of Halloween.

Now let's compare the two renditions of Dr Loomis.
Donald Pleasance's portrayal showed a man haunted by his failure as a psychologist, an otherwise brilliant man who just never could get through to this boy of pure evil, and that mark against him has clearly had an effect on his psyche.  Through this, though, there's still some humor left in him, as when he scares Lonny away from the house and grins to himself as the boy scampers off.
Malcolm McDowell gives the depth of someone who's just read his lines for the first time just before the camera rolled.  I don't fault Mr McDowell for this, I fault the script and direction.  His Dr Loomis shows no real connection to anyone else in the film; he acts panicked at times, slightly brooding at others, but we never get the sense that he's anything other than just a guy who's known Michael since he was a boy, and has come to regard him as scary.  He's more like a pep coach, aware of the ghastly failure last time, but let's give it another go anyway, shall we?

Another flaw the backstory brings to the table is this:  By the time we get to the modern day with the night of horrors the movie's supposed to be about, there's no time to give any kind of depth to any of the characters.  We don't care about them, we just want them to shut up and stop screaming.  Laurie elicits no sympathy as all her friends are dying around her, because we haven't gotten a chance to get to know her or anybody else.  By the time they're introduced, there's just enough time now for Michael to come to town and start slashing.

The biggest flaw of all is the completely inept handling of what should be a masterpiece of suspense.  That's what the 1978 version was about - suspense and tension.  Rob Zombie has bludgeoned those ideas altogether, and his movie is just about brutality and gore.  Sure, that gets uncomfortable to watch after a while, but it's not scary.  It's not horror.  It's just watching unedited news reels of murder scenes.  This type of filmmaking works fine for ""House of 1,000 Corpses"", because the theme of god-awful brutality is what that movie's about.  But not ""Halloween"".  ""Halloween"" is supposed to be about terror, tension, suspense.

Nothing in Rob Zombie's butchery is remotely scary.  The only reason I was getting tense is that I was hoping it would end soon.  There is no buildup, there is no development, there is only the cheap thrill of some over-the-top violence.  Prolonged shots of somebody screaming and bleeding are not scary.

I enjoy his music, and ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is a guilty pleasure movie I'll load up now and again, but I have never been so disappointed in a movie until this.  Especially considering what a comprehensive horror aficionado Rob is.
I expected something much, much better.

Bottom line:
If the depth of your horror interests goes no further than the recent trend of torture-flicks like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"", you'll probably dig this.  If something with some atmosphere and good acting is more your style, steer WAY clear of this turkey.",1194393600,4,5967,4.591682419659735

Rob Zombie's update has succeeded in mangling virtually every element, to the point that there isn't a single thing right in it.

I'll first address those who rail against we who post negative critiques, saying that we just need an open mind and we need to be willing to see a new interpretation:
Bull.
I have no problem with new interpretations as a concept, but a classic of the genre, a film that is one of the pinnacles of suspense horror deserves a better turn that to be ""re-envisioned"" into this execrable waste.

2944646,4,B000VKL6Z2,"""Horror has to step outside that boundary that is beyond taste""-Wes Craven

Harsh critics of this film need to take that lesson to heart. Horror is not meant to be something that society sees as tasteful or neccesary. Just what kind of gruesome deaths are tasteful? Was Janet Leighs death in Psycho tasteful because you never see the knife piercing the skin? What difference does it make? She died. Audiences are used to seeing that and that is the reason that kind of P.C horror is no longer suspenseful nor scary. If a little blood and guts is too much for you then maybe you should stick to the more ""safe"" fare such as SCREAM.

Rob Zombie took a character that had become a cliche and unscary and kicked him back into the fearful monster that he is. Yes, the movie spent less time on stalking and more time on killing. How long would a killer stand there and watch you before he made his move? He's there and he strikes. He doesn't wait around for you to put your clothes back on before he does the deed.

2944652,1,B000VKL6Z2,"In early September, I went to the theater to see Rob Zombie's 2007 version of Halloween, and despite my reservations over the very notion of a remake of the 1978 classic--Not to mention a few controversies along the way--I wanted to give the film a fair shake...

Put simply--the update is a mess and really makes you appreciate the genius of John Carpenter and Debra Hill back in '78.

As a 10 year old child, Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) brutally kills his sister Judith (Hanna Hall) and his stepfather (William Forsythe). Shortly thereafter, young Michael is put in an asylum and placed under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).

Years later, the boy, now an emotionless catatonic man has escaped back to his hometown of Haddonfield to complete the murderous rampage. that began all of those years ago. Now, the adult Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) is back, and his hometown is about to find out that there is no escape from pure evil.

One of the strengths of the Carpenter version of Halloween is its ability to scare viewers using suspense and shock-without having to depend on gore--to tell its story. While I realize Zombie wanted to make the 2007 flick as different as possible, having no desire to make a shot for shot retread, his film uses blood and gore to make up for the fact that his film is just NOT scary.

Even though Zombie keeps the framework of the story in tact, he wastes golden chances to scare us--with the new stuff. As I feared, knowing too much of Myers' backstory just weighs everything down like an anchor. I wouldn't have minded spending 40 minutes learning how screwed up little Mikey's home life is....but frankly, as presented it's quite uninteresting.

The series already tried explaining the Shape's origin in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers with mixed results (see Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, the Producers' Cut for more details). I agree with the Carpenter/Hill approach that ""less is more""-allowing the audience to guess at the killers whys--rather than leading us there--keeping him a mythological figure or evil force--more or less...

Once the film moves into more familiar terrain though, most of that material is either dropped all together or truncated to get to its new conclusion

I actually feel bad for the cast of the movie. Everyone gives it their best shot, but thanks to bad writing by Zombie--most of the characters are given stiff and silly dialogue to utter--with the F-Word thrown in for good measure--a lot.

Many of the movie's great supporting players are wasted here. Dee Wallace, playing Mrs. Strode is introduced quickly and has only one really meaty scene after that... Danielle Harris (who is well known to the franchise faithful having played Jaime Lloyd in both Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5) plays Annie, fares a bit better with screen time but deserves better material.

When I first heard that Malcolm McDowell would be playing Dr Sam Loomis, as a fan of most of his work, I actually was pretty jazzed. It's a shame that his performance only serves to further exalt the way the late Donald Pleasence played the doc through 5 films. Sure, there was a touch of camp the way Pleasence did things, but it never got in the way of you totally buying into it full on. McDowell is not very subtle when chewing the scenery and serves as a major distraction.

Scout Taylor-Compton playing the pivitol role of Laurie Strode isn't given enough time for the part to make her the star that it made Jamie Lee Curtis almost 30 years ago.

Zombie turns the simple killer stalks babysitter premise into a bloody version of a daytime talk show or violent ""After School Special""

Thank goodness, Halloween 2007 has no chance of ever becoming the true classic, that is the original.",1193702400,11,3778,4.78494623655914
2944653,1,B000VKL6Z2,"We arrived at the theater early to get good seats.  Rob Zombie's new rendition of the classic ""Halloween"" had been hyped for weeks on the Internet, television, and in magazines so it was all we could think about.  My wife and I (being devoted fans of the 1978 classic) wanted to be first in line to see just how close the publicity was to the actual delivery.  Is ""re-imaging"" the perfect modern horror film a good idea?  We had mixed feelings on that but nonetheless remained unbiased and anxious to see what Rob Zombie had in store for us.  Sure, his past films didn't exactly amount to anything worthwhile but maybe he worked that out of his system, and this was Halloween.  He at least had a good storyline to draw from.  We sat discussing the many avenues the film could take, watching the small group of other moviegoers take their seat for the matinee showing.  The glow from the projection booth kicked on, the crowd fell silent,  the lights dimmed.

Expecting something intriguing for the opening credits and remembering how stylistic John Carpenter had been with his slow tracking shot of the flickering jack-o`-lantern with credits rolling to the right, I couldn't wait to see how this new remake started.  Excitement quickly gave way to disappointment.  The film simply kicks off with a simple shot of the Myers house being thrown in the audience face complete with the onset of Rob Zombie's blaring, classic rock soundtrack.  I couldn't help but sigh out loud with a sense of  pessimistic foreshadowing ...would this opening scene set the pace for the rest of the film?  I sincerely hoped not.

Next, and in typical Rob Zombie fashion, we are introduced to the loud, obnoxious, vulgar, screaming, white-trash characters in the film.  It was about this point I abandoned all hope of this even coming close to the original and realized this was going to be just another typical Rob Zombie shoutfest, complete with excessive gore, shock value gimmicks, unsteady camera movements, endless close-ups and stereotypical characters including another shameless plug for his wife.  The only difference is this time he had the Halloween name to deceive and lure an audience with.

Lacking any subtle sickness of the original film the movie chugs along as scattered as a shotgun blast.  Rob Zombie attempts to add some backstory to the Michael Myers character but in doing so eliminates any mystery surrounding his presence,  making him just another knife-wielding killer who pops up to slash and kill...slash and kill...slash and kill...

Even the veteran actor  Malcolm McDowell, in his role of Dr. Loomis, can't save this run-of-the-mill Zombie zero.  The character who was so powerfully played by Donald Pleasance in 1978 is now lacking in recklessness determination and intensity.  He is reduced to a soft spoken, school psychiatrist who actually befriends Michael as a child and then just gets lost in the mix as another faceless character/victim.

Although this movie doesn't follow the same predictable suit as its countless sequels, it seems  Mr. Zombie is almost incapable of creating suspense.  Genuinely frightening moments are substituted for unnecessary (and comedic) amounts of carnage, blood, and gore.  The movie feels rushed, paying no attention to mood or atmosphere.  The camera continues to erratically bounce around as Michael Myers keeps popping up so fast I lost track of certain scene settings.  Asking myself, ""Wait...what house are we in now...wasn't he just down the street two seconds ago?""  Characters continue to talk but speak their lines on top of each other and with such speed I actually started laughing at one point.

As the film concluded and the credits began to roll people began to exit the theatre.  I couldn't help but notice the looks of disappointment on  the audience faces as they were leaving.

In a nation of full of trendy PG-13 rated horror films I can respect what Rob Zombie is doing to make a no-I-won't-tone-it-down statement but his in-your-face style of directing doesn't (to say the least) transfer over to this genre very well.  It seems he is just more interested in getting a reaction out of people then creating a good film, which is very sad considering the potential this project had.

Bottom line:  If you are a fan of the original ""Halloween"" you will be insulted by this remake.  Rob Zombie's self-important vision of a classic might play well with today's younger and more gullible teenage audience but for longtime Halloween addicts (and everyone else for that matter) this film is sure to disappoint.",1193616000,114,4571,4.971014492753623
2944654,3,B000VKL6Z2,"OK first off I wasn't expecting too much when I first saw this film.  I wasn't watching it with a note pad and pencil closely examining every discrepancy with the original film nor did I expect it to stand up to the original but then to be honest I didn't really care.

I watched it as an entertaining slasher movie just as the original was.  I guess some people forget that the director commentated that his son loved the films so much because when he took a girl to the movies she would cling hold of him during the scary moments.  I guess some forgot that the original film was designed to entertain and I seriously doubt that too many went to watch it and then came out of cinema describing it as a cinematic masterpiece along side Lawrence of Arabia or Casablanca.

The film starts off with Young Michael's troubled childhood in what I would guess is a small town somewhere.  His mother is a pole dancer, his father? a drunk, wife/kid beater who seems to give his every breath to abusing all around him, his sister while probably the better of the bunch is a bit of a ahem 'girl around town'

Michael carves up small furry animals in his spare time and gets bullied by the local kids eventually getting pushed too far when he gets found out taking various dead things to school (as you do) He takes his revenge on one of his bullies in the most horrific of ways (The scene lasts so long it is pretty disturbing) and then decided to chop up the family (well you know the rest)

The film goes on to chronicle his stay in a mental institution and the reason why he constantly wears a mask (another reviewer has already pointed out why he has taken up the mask he became famous for) carrying out one more horrific attack before making good his escape (in the most unbelievable of ways) picks up a new set of clothes and his trademark knife in an equally ridiculous way, (he was walking around in his slippers and dressing gown prior to that (now why would anyone notice a 6 foot 6 hippie in his dressing gown wandering around the streets?)) and then heads for his home town to kill a few folks.

So begins pretty much a re-run of the original Halloween film.  Few naked babes, lots of blood, Michael appearing and disappearing whenever the mood takes him and his former shrink running about the place flapping while the local police wander about aimlessly.

Horror films are not supposed to have amazing plots they should frighten, shock, disgust and sometimes amuse the audience and this film does a fairly good job. Much of it makes absolutely no sense at all (Michael breaking his chains at will, taking out all who stand before him etc etc) But the same could be said for the original.  Yeh there were discrepancies with the time like but really, this is a horror film I guess if I wanted to be intellectually stimulated by a film I would have gone for a French flick set in a Parisian apartment where some middle aged artist 'analyzes' sex for 2 hours but I didn't I just wanted a bit of cheap gore and I got it.

The first half of the movie is all about young Michael and how he became the killer he is. I would have liked it more but am I the only one that does not think that the constant use of the ""F"" bomb does not make for either compelling dialoge or good story telling.
More than half way through the movie we get to the rush job of the original story which does not allow for any character developement. Parts of it was more intense than the original but you certainly cannot care about this Laurie as much as the original Jamie Curtis Laurie.

I found it interesting to see Myers as a child. I admit, Laurie was a bit too ""bouncy"", but in the end she was great. The scream....what a release!

Unfortunately, like the original movie....the original Dr. Loomis will never be duplicated. I think they cast as best they could....thank about Anthony Hopkins....superb actor, but would've been too typecast and cliche for that role.

Rob Zombie is a genius film-maker...if you don't have a love for his movie-style, than maybe you won't appreciate Halloween.

2944669,4,B000VKL6Z2,"If you check history, you will find that John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" did not come out the gate a critics' darling or a financial success; according to late producer/cowriter Debra Hill, the initial reactions ""were brutal."" Ironic, then, how it has since developed a revered following (though I'm honestly not a big fan) that most people today think was always the case.

I bring this up because Rob Zombie's remake--in addition to being the shot in the arm the franchise desperately needs--will likely have the same fate; years down the road, I think it will be valued on the same level as the ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" remakes. While Zombie's film is jagged in spots, with narrative jumps (where did Loomis get the cop car? how does Michael get to Haddonfield from the middle-of-nowhere truck stop?) and plain-view continuity errors (some of which were probably inspired by the ill-advised Weinstein Bros. reshoots), the filmmaker has brought a pathos to this human monster that is more rich and fulfilling than any of the films prior (yes, I'm including the original).

What seems to offend ""Halloween"" purists most is the mere principle of Zombie's undertaking--how DARE he remake a CLASSIC--instead of looking at the film in the broader scope of things: would you rather see Michael Myers going head-to-head with Busta Rhymes? How about a continuation of that desperate Celtic mumbo-jumbo? Zombie's position was inarguably unglamorous, no doubt realizing as many people would embrace his film as decry it. For my tastes, he has brought an angle that fuses popular serial killer lore with the sense of tragedy that marked the classic Universal Monsters--it's a tricky feat, but by introducing us to pint-size Michael (Daeg Faerch) and spending time with him, his adult counterpart--while a ruthless machine of brutality--possesses the faint traces of humanity that marked Frankenstein's Monster, or the Wolf Man. In many ways, his ultimate downfall is as tragic as the atrocities he commits. And THAT is what ultimately transcends all in ""Halloween""--putting a face and motive to what was once a mere in-the-shadows specter of ""evil.""

The first half of the film provides a satisfying, creatively-filmed backstory (I'm anxiously awaiting the additional scenes being restored for the upcoming DVD), wherein we get an overview of young Michael, his fatal deeds, and his time in Smith's Grove, under the watch of Dr. Sam Loomis (a well-cast Malcolm McDowell). Only in the second half does ""Halloween"" kick into full-blown remake mode, with gritty renderings of scenes from Carpenter's film; despite this, Zombie manages to put his own spin on traditional scares, adding a visceral edge and urgency to death. I actually appreciated the truncated characterizations of Laurie (the immensely likable Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda (Kristina Klebe), and Annie (""Halloween 4/5"" vet Danielle Harris), since their interactions in the original are what ultimately dulled it down for me; here, Zombie gives us a quick introduction (just enough time to get a feel for the characters) before getting down to business. And while the ""sex=death"" equation here is hardly inspired, it certainly beats the torture-device-laden-labyrinth of another ""Saw"" film.

Zombie treats the material with a great deal of reverence and respect, and utilizes a reality-focused style to establish a proper tone (imagine the dustbowl squalor of ""The Devil's Rejects"" brought to suburbia); the death scenes are filmed with unflinching brutality, yet seldom feel exaggerated. Time will tell, but to me, ""Halloween"" is a more than worthy addition to the pantheon of great remakes (and horror films in general).",1192233600,28,3688,5.277683134582624
2944670,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I think this new take on John Carpenter's Halloween is very well done.  It gives lots of scares and suspense.  Malcolm McDowell does a good job portraying Dr. Sam Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton is very good as Laurie Strode.  If you love horror movies, you should definately own this DVD.

2944673,1,B000VKL6Z2,"... it has to sting when another director ""kills"" your crowning achievement.

Here's the thing: I had actually read the horrendous critical reviews of Zombie's film and thought, ""When have critics ever understood horror?"" So, in a weird way, I guess I have only myself to blame ...

As someone who teaches horror-film theory and horror-film studies, I know what will endure the ages and what will not. Still, I'm not some jaded academic. I love horror ... the more (figuratively) visceral, the better. Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B00009UW0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;(1978) is well-respected by film scholars (even the snobbiest!) for a reason: it manages to inspire terror with little on-screen bloodshed ... much like Hooper's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>&nbsp;(1974).  Neither of these works necessitate a remake. And, while Nispel's 2003 revisit of ""TCM"" elicited tension and revulsion (both good), Zombie's ""Halloween"" only elicited anger.

Foremost, the film is technically unpolished. At one point, the viewer becomes convinced that Loomis (McDowell) is responsible for Myers's adult outbursts. In early therapy sessions, Loomis and Myers both wear black ... it becomes the topic of their conversation. It draws a parallel between the two. Then, Loomis pens an account of his experience with Myers and begins a book-tour. The scene opens with a projection of Myers' face ... and as Loomis utters ""Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, they absence of light, these are of a psychopath"" the camera moves to an extreme close-up of Loomis' eyes. So for the entire film, the viewer waits for the ""other shoe to drop"" ... for Loomis to confess some (perhaps ""unconscious"") involvement in Myers' now silent rage. But this never happens ... so one is led to ask, why create these parallels and then fail to complete the message? At best, we may discover the connection in the director's cut ... at worst, it was a really unforgivable error in filming.

The casting of Myers is horrendous. Why make him physically monstrous? Carpender's original casting of Nick Castle was clever (tall but muscular), Zombie's casting of WWF/WCW wrestler Tyler Mane (6'8 and grotesquely built) was all too literal. Carpender's Myers terrifies audiences without having to appear physically extraordinary ... he is ""The Shape"" (for those in the know) ... not ""The Lumbering Blob.""

Moreover, by providing one of the most wretched back-stories I have ever witnessed, Zombie destroys Carpenter's most gruesome message ... some people are born evil. This is why Donner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen/dp/B000EYK4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen</a>&nbsp;(1976) was so gripping. Damien was born evil ... no amount of compassion (mother's love/father's love) could alter that which was encoded on the child's DNA (if you will). To make Myers' a product of his environment ... well, that's just obvious. I forgot, was this a film or an after-school special?

These are the most unbelievably painful problems ... I'll not even launch into the needless deaths of several adults who DO NOT warrant such treatment (by logic and theory). Or Zombie's vile treatment of a ""Halloween"" cult-favorite like Danielle Harris (creepy, but in a pathetic way). Maybe Zombie thought he was evolving the genre ... maybe he thought was modernizing Carpenter's work ... maybe he needs to mature (but he's already forty-five) and learn from the masters (like Carpenter and Hooper): less is better.

So, I return to my original question ... ""When have critics ever understood horror?"" I guess I must have forgot that the critics were blown-away by Romero's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>&nbsp;(1978), raved over Kubrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shining/dp/B00005ATQJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shining</a>&nbsp;(1980), lauded Hooper's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poltergeist/dp/B000V4UFZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poltergeist</a>&nbsp;(1982), gushed over Shyamalan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;(1999), and loved Boyle's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;(2003). I guess they have always known what constitutes film worthy of an audience. Next time, I hope I will take my cue from these professionals ... and, I sincerely hope Zombie will do likewise.",1191024000,15,4987,6.769110764430577
2944674,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Ok, everyone is bashing this film as if it actually is the worst of the series, yet in reality it really isn't that bad. First of all, you have to understand this fim is not a sequel of Halloween Resurrection nor any other Halloween film. Along with the late great Moustapha Akkad (God rest his soul)the original Halloween series has died. Lets face it Halloween fans, the 8th and final film (Halloween: Resurrection) was an embarassment and there was absolutley no where else to go with the franchise. Thus the film by Rob Zombie, who was charged to re-invent this franchice in his own image WITH may i add the blessing of John Carpenter who acually LIKES the film. Carpenter and all loyal Halloween fans know that his film will NEVER be topped and no one should have expected Zombie's film to do so.

ok after my pleading intro lets look at the good, the bad, and the down right ugly. If you are familiar with Rob Zombie's first two film's (House of 1000 Corpes) and (The Devil's Rejects) you will understand the opening scence of this film is vintage Zombie. The slutty sister, trailer trashy house, useless stepfather, and out of this world profanity with words you never knew exzisted....That's just Zombie. The great thing about the film is that it actually does spend some time in Michael's childhood, an element Carpenter left out of the original. The bad about the childhood scenes are they still just leave us all dumbfounded as to why Myer's becomes a killer. One minute little Michael is eating candy, next he's got duck tape a knife and a metal baseball bat. The mental hospital scences show Michael slowly turn into just a silent kid who has a mask obsession and it just doesn't make much sense (probably what they wanted). Let me say though Daeg Faerch was the perfect actor to select for the child Myers. This kid has got talent and is scary looking! Awesome performance kid.

Adult Michael: Tyler Maine is a decent actor at best and I believe he should have did a Jason movie rather than a Myers film. A 7ft Michael Myers actually took away from the suspense because it was just too much of a radical transformation. We see little Daeg Faerch, a fifteen years later sign, and then 7 ft Maine. We are used to seeing Myers as a stalker, pacient, never quick to make the kill. This Myers is explosive and never seems to actually stalk his prey, and as stated in a previous review we don't really see him just stare at his victums and do his signature head tilt. Although we do get a scence where he is spinning a body around in circles which is actually kind of funny. Overall Maine did an exceptional job, I'm sure he was just following the script, I doubt there was much study of the original Myers being as this was a new direction film.

Dr. Loomis: ok this is where I was most disapointed with the film, I'm a die hard fan of the Halloween series I saw this movie 3 times in 2 days. We all know Malcolm McDowell is a legend amoung actors, but when it comes to this role I challenge his range. Most people believe the role of Myers himself is the most important, however Carpenter will even tell you he was most excited when Donald Pleasence joined his cast for the original film. Words cannot describe the way Donald Pleasence played the role of Loomis, to this day when you say his name people will only know Pleasence as Sam Loomis. His composure, vocabulary, and overall look just made him perfect for the part, and it is those traits McDowell just didn't display. The only other actor who could have pulled that role off today I believe is Anothony Hopkins, McDowell just failed to deliver what I thought from Pleasence to be oscar worthy performaces.

The Ugly: ok you get a scence with a guy that calls himself ""Big Joe Grizzly"" it's just for laughs, and is pretty funny, but completly unnecessary. Laurie strode's role was tarnished in the film but replacing Jaimee Lee Curtis is practicly impossible so understandable. Scout Taylor-Compton was not terrible in the movie, the way her role was scripted in the movie was. And finally the role of Dr. Loomis as I stated in the paragraph above, just a complete failure.

Overall this film is pretty good, definitely the best film Zombie has ever made. His previous 2 were gorefest meaningless films but I think he captured a new vision of Halloween and if there is a sequal he's started us in the right direction. Listen to the score of this film, Zombie does an exellent job using the original music from the first 5 films (excluding Halloween 3 of course). He also uses a couple familar scences from the original, sheet ghost scene where Myers hands Linda a beer. Again just keep in mind this is a new direction the producers are going with the Halloween franchise, people will compare it with the first film which is not the way this film was intended, it is NOT a re-make, if anything this movie will make people want to go out and see the original. John Carpenter's legendary masterpeice STILL reigns supreme. The cast did a great job, actress Scout Taylor-Compton has a great set of screaming pipes on her and does a fine job. Note worthy is the return of Danielle Harris all grown up from playing the neice of Myers in 4 and 5, as well as Brad Dourif who is the voice of Chucky from the Child's Play series, In this film he plays the Sherrif. Halloween fans, Buy the dvd, it is a must have for the collection, and everyone else this movie IS worth the 2 hours, I recommend watching the original first to see the differences.",1191024000,5,5503,4.5155466399197595
2944675,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Yes, this is worse than ""Halloween 6"" when we find out that Michael kills because he is a member of a Druid Cult. Yes, this is worse than ""Halloween Resurrection"" when we see Michael get beat down by Busta Rhymes wearing a Myers mask. And yes, this is worse than ""Halloween 5"" when Michael shows his sensitive side and cries when his niece calls him ""uncle"".

""Halloween 2007"" is the absolute nadir of the ""Halloween"" series, and manages to make the aforementioned films look good by comparison.

In this new movie we find out that Michael kills because the kids in school made fun of him because his mommy is a pole dancer, his stepdad calls him a name that rhymes with ""maggot"", and his big sister didn't take him trick-or-treating (give me Druid Cults any day). We find out that he steals the classic mask from his big sister's burnout boyfriend who wears it first and makes doofus noises when doing so (and you thought Busta Rhymes wearing a Myers mask was bad?). And we find out that he has a sensitive side when he confronts Laurie, drops his knife, falls to his knees, droops his head, takes off his mask, and hands Laurie a photo of the two of them as children (this has to be seen to be believed, but could have been a lot worse since the original screenplay had Michael repeating the word ""Boo"" over and over again since this was his nickname for Laurie - yes, the writer/director actually wanted to show Michael talking as an adult). Give me Michael crying in ""Halloween 5"" any day over this.

Gone is the sweet-natured and innocent Laurie. Instead we have an unsympathetic Laurie who makes fun of the kids she is supposed to care for, and who makes sex jokes with food. Gone is the obsessive Dr. Loomis who knows that Michael's return means Death for Haddonfield. Instead we get a new Loomis who, when asked by the Sheriff why Michael has returned, says ""I don't know, but it can't be good"" and says to his murderous patient as he attempts to kill Laurie, ""Michael, it's me Samuel"" - you can't make up bad dialogue like this.

And gone is the mysterious and creepy Michael Myers - the child who killed his sister, and didn't speak a word after doing so. No scene of his mask slowly appearing in the darkness behind Laurie. No scene of him sitting up in the backround and turning his head to face Laurie. No scene of him tilting his head at a victim he just killed.  No scenes of him in the backround, like a ghost, appearing and disappearing. None of these iconic scenes are referenced.

Instead we see Michael as a child, talking and saying things like ""Happy Halloween, Boo""- can't make this up, people. We see child Myers screaming when he kills, and wearing the classic Myers mask and looking like a bobble-head doll. And we see him having a pity-party when his mom pole dances and he misses out on trick-or-treating, while the '70s rock ballad ""Love Hurts"" plays in the backround. Amateur film-making at it's worst.

As an adult, we see a 7 foot tall Michael wearing an orange paper pumpkin mask (again, you can't make this up) looking like a member of the band Slipknot or the wrestler Kane, and behaving like Jason when he punches guards in the face. We get some clumsy scenes of the girls seeing Michael watching them, but these scenes are so poorly realized that they look like outtakes from ""Halloween 5"". And the new mask Michael wears, with the rotted look and scars, is a pathetic update to the classic Shatner mask.

This new Michael Myers also likes to knock on bathroom stalls, hand a can of beer to a girl, and hold out photos to people (he does this twice). And he likes to drag people around a lot.

This film has no Halloween atmosphere whatsoever, and it looks like the props were bought at Halloween Adventure, with plastic pumpkins, and in one case a wreath on the door of one of the houses. And to make matters worse, we get a first - Christmas in a ""Halloween"" movie. Only Tim Burton is allowed to pull that one off.

And plot inconsistencies galore: Since Myers doesn't drive in this one, exactly how does he get from the hospital to the truck stop, and from the truck stop to Haddonfield? How does he get a 500 pound tombstone from the cemetery to his basement? How does he know who teenager Laurie is since the last time he saw her she was a baby? And how does the sheriff know the adopted baby was Laurie - was there only one baby on the market during that 3 month period and aren't these records confidential anyway?

The attempts at gore fall flat - a character has his eyes gouged out, but when Michael drags his body we see that his eyes look fine. A topless female character gets stabbed in the chest, and it's obvious the director thinks this is a shocking scene since he shows us repeated shots of her lying on the ground screaming, but it's not effective since her acting is dismal (""LAAAURRRIIIEEEE""), and no attempt was made to make it look like she has stab wounds - it looks like they just smeared stage blood on her chest, well, because that's exactly all they did.

The music by Tyler Bates is good, and reworks all of the classic themes from the first movie, however, some of the cues are used at inappropriate times - we first hear the classic main title, not during the opening credits, but 15 minutes later when child Myers is running out of school. The song ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" is used twice just before a character is killed, no subtlety whatsoever.

This is an embarrassing train-wreck of a movie, a weird amalgam of other films in the series (the sister storyline and the song ""Mr. Sandman"" is from ""Halloween 2"", Danielle Harris starred in Parts 4 & 5, and other scenes seem to reference other sequels), and is so bad that it almost feels like the director had contempt for the source material and wanted to make as horrible a parody as possible.

Upon its release, this film, which was not screened for critics, did break box office records for Labor Day Weekend (it opened on 3,500 screens, almost twice the number of screens for a regular release), but the second week earnings are important since they indicate if a film ""has legs"" - earnings dropped a huge 69% second week for this, the largest drop for any movie in the top ten that week, and show that bad word of mouth was starting to get around.

Michael speaks as a child and says things like ""Happy Halloween, Boo"".

You get to see Michael Myers as a kid wearing the classic white mask with his pajamas - he looks exactly like a Michael Myers bobble-head doll.

You see Michael as an adult wearing a home-made orange paper pumpkin mask, a bathrobe, and a pair of slippers.

Michael as an adult ""cruising"" in the men's room looking for some action.  Not *that* kind of action, he's not a Republican Senator, he just needs some new coveralls since his bathrobe won't match the updated classic mask.

Loomis saying things like ""I don't know but it can't be good"" when asked why Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Shouldn't his Doctor know why he came back?

Loomis saying ""Michael, it's me Samuel"" when he sees Michael attacking Laurie.

Loomis saying ""Michael, hell, no, Jesus"" when Michael attacks Laurie again.

Loomis showing the Sheriff the cover of his true crime paperback entitled ""The Devil's Eyes"" - the closeup of the cover is hilarious - Michael as a kid doing his best Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining"" scary stare.

Misplaced music cues. The classic main title played 15 minutes later when Michael is running from school. And ""Laurie's Theme"" played whenever Laurie is not around. And let's play ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" *twice* before murder scenes, so clever. Did a 14 year old direct this?

Michael holding out a photo to Laurie's mom, like a cop, why didn't he just say ""have you seen this girl""?

Michael finding Laurie as an adult and knowing who she is even though he hasn't seen her since she was a baby.

Michael the new Criss Angel - he can get from the hospital to Haddonfield without a car, and transport a 500 pound tombstone from the cemetery with no car.

Michael dropping the knife, falling to his knees, taking off his mask, and *holding out a photo* to Laurie. In the original screenplay, he spoke and said ""Boo, Boo, Boo"" over and over again, but it was cut.

  I was a teenager when the first Halloween (starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) was out and about, now I'm a mature man with a grown daughter, but I still enjoy the scare of a good horror film.
  I have seen all of the other 8 ""Halloween"" films, but this Rob Zombie's Halloween had constant cursing that disenchanted me and I found the first act and second act less suspenseful than the original John Carpenter's ""Halloween"".
  This 2007 version does give you insight to why Michael Myers killed as a child.  In this version, 10-year old Michael's (Daeg Faerch) home life is not the best. His mother, Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and the house appears to be unkept. Her boyfriend, Ronnie, (William Forsythe) lives in the house and argues and shows no respect towards 10-year old Michael (Daeg Faerch).
  In the original 1978 version, the two-story house was so immaculate, the parents were older and of middle class.
  Dare I say, this 2007 film does reflect the way some young people are today and we know of the dysfunctional parents in this day and age too. It makes this film all the more difficult to watch.
  When young Michael becomes maniac due to the kids bothering him in school and the abusive nature of his mother's boyfriend, Michael kills his school enemy Wesley (Daryl Sabara), Ronnie, Judith, his own sister (Hanna R. Hall) and her boyfriend, Steve (Adam Weisman). he leaves his baby sister, Laurie Strode, alive.
  Laurie Strode as a teenager is played by Scout Taylor-Compton, now in the role made famous by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original ""Halloween"" movies.
  This film does not overshadow the cinematography and direction of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), which is still the best scare and suspense of any Halloween film.
  While Rob Zombie's adult ""Michael Myers"" is more giant, grisly and brutal (played by Tyler Mane), Zombie did open my eyes and made a very daring motion in the final act.
  We all know of the chilling ending in the original Halloween (1978), but director/writer Rob Zombie went even further and beyond this point for 15 more minutes. The climax that Rob Zombie added to his ending was very new, fresh and so suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat.  The last 15 minutes surprised me and the last minute twist was fantastic. It left you wanting more.

2944680,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Michael Myers (Faerch) is a kid destined for trouble.  His mom (Zombie) and her boyfriend (Forsythe) are terrible parent figures.  Pushed to the brink, he eventually snaps.  One Halloween, he dons a mask and attacks a school bully.  Then he heads home to kill his family.  The only survivors are his mother and infant sister Laurie.  Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (McDowell).  Loomis eventually realizes he is dealing with pure evil in Michael.  Fifteen years later, on Halloween, Michael (Man) escapes from the sanitarium and heads home to Haddonfield to find his sister, and finish the job he started years before.

""Halloween"" does some things really well, and some things really poorly.  The result is an average movie that in no way eclipses the original.  The good includes Tyler Mane as the grown up Michael.  Finally played by an actual actor, Michael is menacing and really scary.  It's also nice to see familiar scenes from the original.  That, along with the original's music makes the film feel close to the original at times.  Unfortunately, with 45 minutes devoted to backstory that took about 10 minutes in the original, the meat of the story feels compressed and rushed.  There is no building up to the final showdown.  It feels like the movie is one continuous murder after the other.  Lastly, the ending is terrible, without any of the creepiness of the original.  Yes, it has been changed, and not for the better.  Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is an interesting take on the original, but is deeply flawed.  If you want to see a great ""Halloween"", go rent the original directed by John Carpenter.",1190246400,4,1662,4.864285714285714
2944681,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Wow, there is alot of slander about this film flying all over the internet. This film was cursed from the start. A remake of a classic horror movie like Halloween is a daring and risky move! The man in the drivers seat...Rob Zombie. An interesting choice for a director but none the less the film was doomed right from the start. ""Die hard fans"" of the original (like myself) were astonished that Malek Akkad would dare and copy the original classic! But wait a second...the sequels have gotten very stale. Is this the appropriate direction? All in all Rob Zombie's version of Halloween is an entirely different film from the original. I think it was pretty smart to change the direction of the film some so one does make the same mistake that Gus Van Sant did with ""Psycho"". Now the question: Was the remake better than the original? The answer is - No way, not even close! However, this film compliments the original very well. I was surprised with the quality of the film as Rob Zombie is a fairly good director. The film was filled with foul language, nudity and alot of gore! As any good horror movie should be! The casting was well done. Apparently Rob Zombie used the entire cast from his previous movie in Halloween, but I have not seen either of his other two movies, so I don't care in the least. The girl playing Laurie was well cast. Finally Laurie was attractive! Malcolm McDowell as Loomis was brilliant and I loved him in the role. Still nowhere near as good as Donald Pleasence but again, who expected him to be? The back story written into the movie was well done. The little boy who played young Michael Myers managed to creep me out, so that says alot. Michael who is like 10 feet tall in this version is scary again. The ending can go either way for the fans. I happened to LOVE the ending myself, but I am clearly in the minority here! Before you pass judgement on this film, see it. The film BANKED in the theaters and the inevitible sequel is sure to follow. All in all a good film, not as good as the original, but nobody thought it would be.",1190246400,24,2066,4.4109947643979055

You can tell Rob Zombie made this flick. There were some REALLY violent scenes in this. Some were so violent I had to look away and collect myself( NOT A FAN OF THE RAPE SCENE!)

2944683,3,B000VKL6Z2,"When it was announced last year that rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie would be helming a remake of John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" it was met with mixed reactions. Some balked at the idea of remaking such a vital and iconic movie, while others were anxious to see what such a unique character as Rob could do with the material. Count me in the latter. It helps being a fan of his music from the beginning, but also take into consideration how poor the past few ""Halloween"" movies have been. If anyone were to remake it, could it turn out any better than Rob Zombie's? Even after watching it twice, and both times being frustrated with it's lack of focus, I still say the answer to that question is most certainly ""no.""

We all know the story of the Boogeyman, The Shape, or quite simply, Michael Myers. So to do a shot-for-shot remake (ala ""Psycho"") or anything of the like would be silly. Which is exactly where the trouble with this movie lies. ""Halloween 2007,"" as I will refer to it from here-on-out, plays like two very different movies fused together. First, we have Rob's vision. A Michael Myers with a story. He might not be given much motivation, but what Rob gives us in the first half is not only intriguing and disturbing, but actually refreshing when compared to the sequels. This is where he truly makes his mark and reinvents Michael Myers as we know him. About 45 minutes into the movie, however, it takes a turn. From out of nowhere, Rob starts rushing into a lazy remake of the original movie's events. We are introduced to Laurie Strode, this time played by fresh-faced Scout Taylor-Compton, along with Annie (played by Danielle Harris, making a bold return to the series) and Linda (Kristina Klebe). The three girls spout off lines from the original in such an off-handed way that you feel like you're watching an amateur film-maker fresh out of his first high school film-making class. To say the dialogue is terrible would be an understatement: it cripples the second half of the second movie completely! Virtually nothing in the second half of the film is effective. The kids are routinely dispatched in such a careless way. Some characters die after only being in the movie for a matter of moments. There is no character development for the second half, so it's hard to feel any tension. It was nice to see Rob recreate some memorable moments in his own way, and Danielle Harris has some truly unforgettable moments with Michael, but other than that, it's a dud, and as someone who awaited this movie with baited breath (a big ""Halloween"" nut and Rob Zombie fan, mind you), I found myself yawning from time to time in the last half. And let's not even get into it's dud of an ending. Had Rob Zombie stuck with what he had established in the first half and forgotten about paying tribute to the original movie (or whatever he was trying to do) in the second half, the results could have been much, much better.

On a more positive note, it sports an impressive cast. Not only is it satisfying to see Danielle Harris once again facing Michael Myers, but Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"") is about the best they could have done to replace Donald Pleasence and Sam Loomis. Brad ""Chucky"" Dourif, as Sheriff Brackett, is spot on, but unfortunately gets very little time. Just about everyone involved in ""The Devil's Rejects"" gets a part, from Bill Moseley, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie, who takes advantage of her role as Michael's mom and surprisingly goes against the stereotype she has been built up to. Danny Trejo, however, was the biggest surprise, and his parts with Michael are those that work best. His fate serves as the best example of Michael's lack of reason or mercy, and truly makes him a horror villian to be reckoned with and may be enough to send chills down the spines of even the biggest horror fans. Daeg Faerch, who plays a young Michael Myers, is also a nice surprise, as kids in horror movies can tend to be annoying. Yet, he turns in a very creepy and very believeable performance of a very disturbed young boy.

The movie, on the whole, looks gorgeous. Rob obviously knows his stuff, but the major problem is in the script. At times, the movie feels incomplete, and at others, it feels like he is making it up as he goes along. It goes without saying that the original didn't need to be remade, as it is still effective to this day, so if a ""re-telling"" was neccessary, why didn't Rob make it his own? Like ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers,"" you can literally smell the studio interference here. The movie not only makes little sense, but feels incomplete and rushed. What starts off as an intriguing and refreshing take on a well-known character, eventually degrades itself into boring drivel. It's painful to say it, but Rob's vision of ""Halloween"" hardly pans out any better than the dismal ""H20"" or ""Resurrection."" Even those watching who don't know the original should sense that something is wrong here. It's like Rob Zombie either didn't have the confidence to make this his own, or didn't really want to make the film in the first place.",1189382400,,5131,4.667403314917127
2944684,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Halloween (2007) Director Rob Zombie seems to be no stranger to serial killer/horror genre after past projects (e.g., The Devil's Rejects (2005) and House of 1000 Corpses (2003)) that have focused on similar themes.  However, remaking a cinema classic such as the John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween is no ""walk in the park"" given the film's established cult following.

But Rob Zombie seemed up to the task with an excellent screenplay that focuses on Michael Myers troubled beginnings as an 8-year old child from a broken home; his fetish for masks; as well as the subsequent homicides, fratricide, and to some extent--matricide--as his mother committed suicide following Myers initially killing spree. These horrific and visually graphic events (the film has been Rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and terror throughout, sexual content, graphic nudity and language.) eventually lead to Myers incarceration at Smith's Grove Sanitarium for the next 15 years.

Upon his inadvertent liberation at the hands of a decadent watchman and his equally obtuse cousin, Myers picks up where he left off, spilling carnage along his path until he comes face-to-face with his younger sister and former physician Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell; Star Trek: Generations).

Much like most slasher-flicks of the past, Halloween (2007) does not present a fresh take on this age-old formula. Instead, the average moviegoer's interest may be piqued by the director's vision and take on the ""selectively mute"" (and I use this term very loosely) Michael Myers.",1189382400,3,1543,5.337448559670782
2944685,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombies's Halloween is awesome way better then the original. Zombies take and style is brutal and disturbing which makes this movie great. Zombie's intense style of camera shots is what makes this movie roll. It's right in your face and keeps you on the edge. I love how some scene's Zombie shakes the camera with the the music being intense while Michael is attacking someone. The lighting and sound effects are brilliant. The back story of young Michael is creepy and makes him more human instead of some guy just in a mask killing people who is invincible. I just want to say thank you Mr. Zombie for making the Halloween franchise scary again. This is just and all around good movie ,just don't come into this comparing it to the original. Think of it as a another movie on it's own. Just watch it and enjoy it.",1189209600,3,819,4.503355704697986

2944687,5,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, I think Rob Zombie is just getting better and better at this. Afterall, I thought the best he had to offer was ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" but this movie exceeded all expectations that I had. Secondly, I am pleasantly surprised to see that his wife Sherry Moon Zombie can actually act which I was highly doubtful of in the beginning. To be quite honest, I don't know if this movie can be considered a remake or a prequel, but maybe, it's Zombie's vision of Michael Myers, and this was his take on the story. Thus, giving the audience an understanding of why Michael Myers is the monster that he is. Personally, I think Rob Zombie's mission is to breathe life back into the horror genre that has been dead and buried for some time now thanks to the lack of originality by ""the powers that be."" I believe his mission has been accomplished with this version of Halloween. This movie is not some ""teen slasher"" fluke, nor is it for for the squeamish at all, and it's the closest thing you'll find to scary these days. It starts off showing Michael Myers as a 10 year old boy. Michael's mother is a stripper, his stepfather is abusive, and his older sister is a slut. Michael is also tormented at school by fellow classmates. In fact, the only things that Michael finds any solice in, is torturing and killing animals and his ability to create masks. The only person Michael even relates to is his baby sister. On Halloween, Michael snaps by beating one of his bullies to death in the woods behind the school. Later on that night, he kills his stepfather, sister, and her boyfriend after they refuse to take him trick or treating. After that, Michael is institutionalized for having no knowledge of even commiting these murders. I think we all know the rest of the story from here. At any rate, this movie goes inside the mind of one of the sickest, most brutal killers of all time. I hate to have to spoil some of the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the one reasons I don't think this is a prequel or a remake because Michael kills Dr. Loomis in this one, and we all know for this to be a prequel or a remake that can't be possible. Other than that small detail.. I LOVED IT!",1189209600,3,2223,4.38498789346247
2944688,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob, you've had me frustrated with this film from the very beginning. The fact it was being made, that you were doing it, and then the horrendous reviews that were coming in from critics and ""online"" people. I went into the movie expecting the worst after reading these so called ""reviews"", and I came out very happy. No movie in recent memory has had me frustrated, nor have I been so led astray from online communities I usually believe. Rob Zombie's interpretation of the 1978 John Carpenter original is by no means a masterpiece. It is flawed, it has cliches, it has holes big enough to drive a semi thru, and parts that expect you to defy all logic. That being said, it was an interesting ride. You all know the story, so no need to get into that. The second the movie starts, it's a bit jarring. It is definitley a Rob Zombie movie, but definitley not a Halloween movie. Things get better once little Michael starts to snap. I was not a fan of the redneck, hillbilly, white trash section of this film, but it gets good when Michael finally flips. Plus, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingy emotional and touching in places. William Forsythe?. Well, he's William Forsythe. The second section, at Smith's Grove, is quite interesting. Michael's break out is a little too easy, but riveting nonetheless. The third section, where things really take us to ""Halloween"" land, is not a ""shot by shot remake"" that others would lead you to believe. There are some dialogue lifted from the original, and some classic scenes are recreated. However, most of these recreated scenes have a different touch to them, and this half also has new scenes, outcomes, directions, and so on, that cancel out ALL claims that it is a shot by shot remake. Zombie always keeps things interesting and interesting looking, if not some of the characters. He has littered the movie from start to finish with numerous decorations, pumpkins, and trick or treaters, to make this movie feel more like Halloween than even the original, and a number of the sequels. The three teenage girls are a problem. The Laurie character is no Jamie Lee, but she doesn't quite get as short changed as the other two, especially the Linda character. This part of the film felt a bit rushed and poorly thought out. At least Danielle Harris is still beautiful!. Malcolm McDowell is a welcomed Loomis. Once you see him and hear his voice, you realize that there is no other person but him who could of been Loomis. As for Tyler Mane, I was ready to hate his Michael, but I didn't. I still think he's too big, but he was effective and creepy in places. Brad Dourif was a fun choice for Sheriff Brackett, but like other B movie veterans, he is underused and discarded not long after he's introduced. The violence makes Carpenter's original look PG rated. Brutal violence like this has it's place, but I don't care for it in a Halloween movie. That being said, it didn't take me out of the picture as stated by other critics. However, I did feel a scene here and there were quite pointless and were just there to be extreme and hardcore, as if Rob couldn't dream up some scares so he wanted to just jolt people again. The score is teriffic. Bits of Carpetner's original are here and there, as well as Tyler Bates' own. Folks, this isn't the hatchet job a lot of Zombie haters and Halloween purists(of which I am one)are ballyhooing about. It's a very strong and interesting film that had me hooked from start to finish. There is no denying that nothing will ever top or match Carpenter's scary classic, but this was probably the best Halloween since the original, and the first to really give out that classic Halloween vibe, especially in the third act. I never thought I would find myself defending a Rob Zombie movie, since I was not a fan of his other films, but here I am. It's wicked, it's nasty, it's atmospheric, it's creepy, and it's just a wild ride. The first horror movie in a long time to really grab me and make me think about it afterward. Rob, I was all set to write some witty attacks on your film, but I won't get to use them. Instead, I say thanks, thanks for making a Halloween film that really hits you for the first time in nearly 30 years.",1189209600,3,4205,4.541501976284585
2944689,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Few directors can be trusted to make a good slasher movie these days, let alone a good remake of any kind of horror movie. Most  everybody else has moved on, lost their magic, or never had it in the first place.

This is all the more vital if one is going to tribute film patriarchs. Gus van Sant's version of *Psycho* is still contentious--an egotistical blasphemy as far as some buffs are concerned. Tom Savini's brilliant remake of *Night of the Living Dead* seems largely ignored to me, while Zack Snyder's *Dawn of the Dead* is really a dumb Americanization of *28 Days Later*. Important considerations if one presumes to remake that daddy of slasher films, *Halloween*.

Independent film master John Carpenter gave us the original, based on a screenplay co-written with Debra Hill. Dimension Films acquired the rights and after a string of terrible sequels, began looking to reboot the series. Along comes Rob Zombie.

Up front, forget this noise about ""re-envisioning,"" or ""making it your own"", or ""a film for a new generation"". I only care about good movies. Movies with smarts and maturity, from plot to acting to editing. Movies that love themselves and love their audiences too. Like Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth, Rob Zombie combines a respect for his roots with the skill and vision to apply them. With a couple exceptions, *Halloween* is such a slasher movie.

Mainly because Zombie chucks out the supernatural canards in favor of a true crime sensibility. Nuts to that stuff about the curse of Samhain. The real horror comes from a dirt head little boy in a Kiss t-shirt, who takes enough abuse with too little love to become a psychopath. The first half of the movie charts Michael Meyer's transition into murder, complete with screaming parents, indifferent siblings, and schoolyard bullies. By the time school authorities discover evidence of the boy's madness, things become famously, dramatically too late.

Plenty of horror movies have a vignette or a toss-away speech to explain their villains. Rob Zombie spends two whole acts to show how Meyers is shaped by his environment to become The Shape. Along these lines he develops actual relationships between the killer and other people, most notably that of his mother, a janitor, and Dr. Sam Loomis. The mother and doctor in particular play much longer and deeper roles than in the original film, contributing greatly to my interest. But even the sister and father get more screen time and development in terms of Michael's growing addiction to death.

That Zombie fills in gaps is another mark of the film's quality. We see when Michael finally crosses the line from a troubled boy to a speechless murder machine. How he escapes imprisonment. How Meyers acquires his mask and coveralls. How he knows to stalk the virgin babysitter Laurie and her not-so-virgin friends.

And stalk he does. For Zombie's vision is dark, literally as well as figuratively. A selective use of slow motion, sound effects, and low-end rhythms in the soundtrack evoke night-time terrors even during the day. It makes heavy use of source lighting to create thick shadows. For that matter, a lot of the sound is source-based too, and Zombie sometimes uses deep throated sirens or high pitched baby screams as a substitute for ambient music. The film itself is saturated to emphasize dark colors, and even broad daylight looks as if shot through a grimy window.

The blood is dark red to black, which probably helped this movie get an ""R"" instead of an ""NC-17"". It also helps that, as usual for horror movies, most of The Shape's victims are unsympathetic--it's always okay to kill cops, abusive dads, truckers, and sluts in the movies.  And as usual, we don't see the death of animals or little kids. We even get the old clich&eacute;' of a loathsome punk being killed, to foreshadow another character's prowess. I don't knock the movie much for this, though, because *Halloween* comes from that sort of tradition. The most ""innocent"" victims are still portrayed as schmucks, and indeed one of the recurrent themes in Rob Zombie movies is that the public is too naive and ill-equipped to deal with psychos.

Speaking of violence and themes, Zombie eschews the current trend in dismemberments and arterial sprays. He also avoids the 1980's trend of lingering on the murder weapon as if it were a phallus. Instead, Mike Meyers lands fierce, rapid blows; he does not stab so much as bludgeon. And while he does not torture his victims, they die more painfully and terror-stricken than in *Hostel*. Because where Zombie does linger is the moment of expiration, and so *Halloween* is a death fan's delight. People gurgle and twitch in bathtub-sized pools of blood, as their killer looks them in their bulging eyes... Typically, the majority of time the camera skips over a death scene is when the victim is an animal.

Indeed, the one sin of this film is not brutality, but boredom. The Shape kills about 21 characters, most of them extras or cameos, and I began to tire around 17. By the time Meyers stalks the babysitters, the murders play more like the original: faster, less bloody, but more cinematic. Yet it was too late; the pursuit of the Laurie character dragged further, with multiple escapes and captures and false deaths. I never got the sense that Zombie was aware of how much the story dragged in the last half-hour. He only changed his portrayal of murder when he wanted to bring his vision closer to that of Carpenter, or to avoid upsetting PETA.

Zombie's own sin then, is that he doesn't give his audience enough credit. Believe me, Rob: I study violence and psychopathy; I spent eight years in the military, I know plenty of violence victims, and I am a witness to violence myself. So I got the point before I even stepped into the theater. I wanted to be entertained, and that doesn't happen when I start to yawn. I have three murder scenes in mind that could be altered to a non-fatal attack, or cut altogether, and the climatic chase can also stand to shave about two minutes.

So yeah, I liked the first half of the movie, which consisted mainly of original material and real shocks, than the more derivative second. That's not the final word on this movie. It's a damn sight better than most, let alone all horror remakes I've seen. Most of the latter suck because they are made by commercial and music video directors who have no competency or love for the source material.  It's further obvious that Hollywood has become too cheap and risk-adverse to make original films. I tend stay away from the theater as a result.

Rob Zombie, himself a music video director, is that rare fellow who can make water better than most people can make a movie. That's a strong statement from a guy who doesn't believe in brownnosing, and I solicit it freely because it's the truth. If you want to see a good movie in general, not just a good slasher, see Zombie's remake of *Halloween*.",1188864000,,6937,4.807046979865772
2944690,4,B000VKL6Z2,Well I will say that I had heard mixed reviews going into this movie some saying that it was awful and some people it was great. I thought that it was a very solid effort by Rob Zombie considering some of his other movies I had not been to found of. I got to see the first Halloween first before the new one so that was cool. The one thing that I really liked about the new movie is it took time to give you the story we he wants to live behind the mask. You got to see what it was like in his family and how kids treated him and there were some pretty cool killings. Another thing that I liked about the new Halloween is this was non stop action. I have watched all the Halloweens and they seemed to move slower which is not a bad thing but I would say it was a nice change to see non stop action. I did not know when it was going to end but the ending is for you to judge I did not like it that much and I will say that is the only flaw in this movie but a really solid effort and better than the recent Halloween movies. I think that you should pick this up on DVD when it comes out or at least rent it. It is for you to judge but I liked it so give it a shot.,1188777600,2,1163,3.693548387096774
2944691,4,B000VKL6Z2,This was by far one of the greatest remakes Ive seen. The prequel leading up to the remake was sweet! Rob Zombie really exceded my expetations with this movie . No remake is going to be good as the original so all those idiots need to shut it whining that didn't like it. As a Halloween movie it was by far the best since Pt. 4 or 5 . Really sweet movie GO SEE IT OVER AND OVER!,1188777600,3,378,3.858974358974359
2944692,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I really enjoyed the original movie, and thought the remake looked really interesting.  I knew it would take on a different twist, especially since I looked at the spoilers on Wikipedia.  However, I didn't realize it would show the murders.  I left the movie after the first act finished, as I was numbed and tired from seeing the beatings/murders in their entirety.  The original was better in that the scenes cut away during the beatings.  The viewer still knew the victims were being murdered; watching the scenes in the remake was so unnecessary.  The music was sensational and I loved the inclusion of the original Halloween theme.  The backstory was clever (I differ from the reviewers who said the remake gave too much away).  Still, I was very disappointed with all the gore shown.  I long for the movies where the story was more about creepy than blood and gore.  I think I'll go rent the original at Blockbuster now.",1188777600,2,926,4.73125

2944695,1,B000VKL6Z2,"As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.

The problem with this ""Halloween"" is:

1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from ""Devil's Rejects"" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.

2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.

 In the original, the grown up Michael was known as ""The Shape"", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.

3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to ""God Of Thunder"", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.

4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! ""Rest in Peace""? You bet.

5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, ""What do I do now?""

6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is ""Halloween"" not ""High School Musical"".

7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E's ""Cold Case File"" or ""American Justice"". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.

8. The ending. Absolute bull***t.

3176852,3,B000VKL6Z2,"It's hard to recommend this new version of Halloween because it's brutal and disturbing but well acted and well made. The body count increased incredibly in this remake. I can't even count how many people died in the movie.

  The movie is creepy and scary and despite how awfully violent it is I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I might need therapy for that reason though. This is probably the most insane movie I have seen, well next to Devil's Rejects anyway. Rob Zombie is a good director but.....the movie is a bit over done. We didn't need the body count to be even bigger this time around.

  Seeing person after person die brutally tends to get tiresome and hard to watch and it even holds the movie down from being great. There's a little too many un-needed killings in the movie. Rob Zombie went all out when he really didn't have to. He loses focus on the main story by having sooo many side characters brutally murdered.

  The movie is gripping especially at the end but the beginning drags on too long and is a bit depressing despite a creepy performance by the kid who plays young Michael. Sarah Moon also does good work as his mother and you feel bad for her since she clearly loves her child who broke her heart by going all psycho. Rob Zombie pulls off giving us a film that's a bit different, so if you are avoiding it because you feel as if you seen it already, don't avoid it for that reason. You might want to avoid it due to being so over the top violent though.",1188691200,2,1483,4.324909747292419
3176853,4,B000VKL6Z2,"There may be nothing in the world Rob Zombie could have done with this remake of the slasher masterpiece, HALLOWEEN, to outdo John Carpenter's original. The first, and best, HALLOWEEN took its audience by total surprise, and its subtletey continues to impress, especially now, in this age of excess, instant gratification, and horror gore. Having said that, the new HALLOWEEN is, by far, more frightening than any of the HALLOWEEN SEQUELS--and, yes, I am including Part II in that assessment.

You can count me in on the large crowd that clamored and complained that HALLOWEEN didn't need remaking. I still think that. Rob Zombie was evidently conscious of this sentiment, too, because he went very far to make this movie his own. There are significant departures from the original storyline, which was powered by its very mystery and its unapologetically unexplainable boogeyman. By contrast, Zombie explains everything--and he makes you watch everything, too; not in the comfortable, established, Hollywood-safe method of bloodletting (watch any of the FRIDAY movies for examples of this), but in brutal, painful-to-watch murder scenes that are, at times, deliciously tortuous to endure.

Some will say they don't want to know WHY Michael is what he is. He's more frightening because we DON'T get him. Okay. That's true. However, these explanations take up a lot of Zombie's movie, and whatever one may say about the strengths of the original, these are probably the most horrifying scenes in the film. Watching ten-year-old Michael take out everyone in his family other than his mother and little sister--using duct tape, a baseball bat, and, of course, a butcher knife--was the most disturbing thing I'd seen since HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.

What I missed most from the original was Donald Pleasance. I thought the replacement for Jamie Lee Curtis was actually the only real improvement the movie had on the original (and I just know that most people will disagree with me on that, but what the heck); but Malcolm McDowell is astonishingly weak in his portrayal of Dr. Loomis. Strange ... Going in, he was the only one I really had confidence in.

It's impossible not to compare. You can't simply take the movie on its own merit, and when a filmmaker decides to remake a classic, he opens himself up to that unpleasantness. Even if you are coming to HALLOWEEN for the first time, you've been exposed to it through its paltry imitations and sequels. Ranked up against them, this HALLOWEEN is a fine, frightening tour de force.

3176854,5,B000VKL6Z2,"When I first heard about Rob Zombie writing and directing the remake to John Carpenter's HALL0WEEN, I immediately knew that the film was gonna be incredible. I am a major fan of Michael Myers and the entire HALLOWEEN series, so you ought to believe how excited I was to see this film when Rob Zombie had finished it. Little did I know that this remake was even more incredible than I had anticipated. I was expecting a great remake, and what I saw was not great; it was fu*BEEP*ing outstanding. Rob Zombie went into a completely different direction with his remake, a direction so different that this remake does the original film so much more justice.

The film starts on Halloween, introducing MICHAEL MYERS (played by Daeg Faerch) , a troubled ten year old boy. In his room, Michael admires Elvis, a pet rat, while wearing a clown mask. Downstairs, his mother DEBORAH MYERS (played by Sherri Moon Zombie, Rob Zombie's sexy wife) argues with her crippled boyfriend RONNIE WHITE (played by William Forsythe) and Michael's sister JUDITH MYERS (played by Hannah R. Hall). Michael, in the bathroom washing a small bloody knife, is called downstairs by Judith. Ronnie berates him, teasing him for wearing masks all the time. Later at school, Michael is confronted by WESLEY RHODES (played by Daryl Sabara), a bully, and his friend. Wesley teases Michael, threatening to make copies of a newspaper advertisement for The Rabbit in Red, a strip club where Michael's mother works. A fight ensues and Deborah is called into the school to speak with DR. SAMUEL J. LOOMIS (played by Malcolm McDowell), a child psychologist. Loomis wants to evaluate Michael, after the school found a dead cat and numerous photographs of dead animals in Michael's backpack. Michael, overhearing the conversation, leaves the office and follows Wesley Rhodes into the woods. Donning his clown mask, Michael brutally beats the bully with a sturdy tree branch. While Wesley begs for mercy, Michael finds the advertisement in his coat pocket. He takes it before murdering Rhodes.

At home, Ronnie and Michael are watching a movie on television as Deborah is about to leave for work. Before leaving, she tells Michael that every thing will be better soon. She leaves, and Judith is left to take Michael trick-or-treating. However, Judith's boyfriend STEVE shows up, canceling Michael's trick-or-treat plans. Ronnie falls asleep on the couch, leaving Steve and Judith to have sex in her room. Michael, again donning his clown mask, proceeds to duct tape Ronnie to the couch, where Michael then violently slits Ronnie's throat. Upstairs, Steve and Judith finish having sex, and he puts on the infamous William Shatner mask, wanting to have sex with the mask on. Judith refuses, and Steve goes downstairs to make some food. While in the kitchen, Michael sneaks up on Steve and bludgeons him with an aluminum baseball bat. With Judith asleep upstairs, Michael finds and puts on the white mask. He enters Judith's room, and places his hand on her leg. Mistaking him for Steve, Judith turns and questions the silent Michael, slapping him. He then stabs her in the stomach with a kitchen knife. As she stumbles through the halls of the house, Michael follows, stabbing her a total of seventeen times. He then enters the baby's room and takes her out to the porch. Deborah returns home from work, finding Michael and the baby on the porch. The police arrive, and Michael is taken into custody.

Eleven months later, Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Loomis. In recorded therapy sessions with Loomis, Michael claims to not remember anything about killing. As Deborah has weekly visitation rights, Michael now creates and wears masks at all times. By Christmas, Loomis and Michael are screaming at each other. Eventually, Michael stops talking. During a visit, Deborah gives Michael a picture of him holding his baby sister. Moments later, as Loomis is about to walk Deborah to her car, Michael stabs an overseeing nurse in the throat with a fork. At the Myers home, Deborah is watching old home movies of Michael, crying. She then proceeds to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head.

Fifteen years later, Loomis tells a 27-year-old MICHAEL MYERS (played by Tyler Mane), who hasn't said a word in 15 years, that he is no longer going to be his psychologist. That same night, Smith's Grove plans on transferring Michael to a maximum security prison. Before the asylum police can transfer him, Michael kills them, and eventually the majority of the Smith's Grove staff. He escapes, and runs into a truck driver named Big Joe Grizzley. Michael confronts him in the bathroom, and kills him, stealing his coveralls. Michael completes his journey by returning to his home. Under the floorboards, he finds the knife with which he murdered his family, and the white William Shatner mask, now tarnished and dirty.

The story shifts to that of LAURIE STRODE (played by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie is living a happy life with her parents, CYNTHIA STRODE (played by Dee Wallace) and MASON STRODE (played by Pat Skipper). As she heads off to school, Laurie is met by TOMMY DOYLE (played by Skyler Gosondo), a boy she babysits. They pass the old Myers home, where Laurie must drop off an envelope for her father. Tommy warns her not to go near the house, as the boogeyman lives there. Laurie toys with Tommy, while Michael watches from inside the house. At school, Laurie and her best friends, ANNIE BRACKETT (played by Danielle Harris) and LYNDA van der KLOK (played by Kristina Klebe), make plans for Halloween night as Laurie notices Michael watching her from outside. Annie convinces Laurie to babysit for her that night, so Annie can meet with her boyfriend Paul. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield to find the Myers's gravestone missing and the grave vandalized with a crucified animal carcass. On the way home from school, Laurie notices Michael again, and Lynda and Annie mock him. Annie is picked up by her father, LEE BRACKETT (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, the killer doll), the town sheriff, who offers Annie a ride home. Lynda also eventually leaves, and Laurie is followed home by Michael. That evening, Laurie leaves her home with Annie to babysit at Tommy's house. After they leave, Michael murders the Strode family. Michael then returns to his house, only to find Lynda and her boyfriend, BOB SIMMS (played by Mick Mennell), having sex. Bob leaves the living room to get more beer, and is met halfway back by Michael, who impales him to a wall with his knife. Michael puts a sheet over his head while wearing Bob's glasses. Lynda mistakes Michael for Bob, and as she turns around, Michael strangles her to death.

At the Doyle house, Annie leaves Lindsey Wallace with Laurie and Tommy. Annie then returns home to be with her boyfriend PAUL (played by Max van Ville). While they have sex, Michael comes and murders Paul, while severely beating Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett, convinced by Loomis that Michael is in Haddonfield, is searching the town in his patrol car. He tells Loomis that he responded to the 9-1-1 call for Deborah Myers's suicide. He found the young baby sister, but did not want her to grow up knowing what happened to her family. He took her to a foster home, where she was adopted by the Strode family.

Laurie heads back to the Wallace home to take by Lindsey, when they two find the bodies of Paul and Annie. Paul is dead, hung from the ceiling rafters with a jack o' lantern on his head, while Annie is severely injured, but alive. Laurie tells Lindsey to go back to Tommy's house, while she calls 9-1-1. As Lindsey leaves, Michael, who was hiding behind the door, shuts it, and begins to chase Laurie. Laurie outruns Michael to the Doyle house, and she and the children look themselves in a room. As police officers arrive, Michael kills the officers, breaks into the bathroom and takes Laurie. Loomis and Brackett, responding to Laurie's 9-1-1 call, finally arrive at Lindsey's house to find Annie still alive on the floor. Loomis leaves, only to see Tommy and Lindsey, screaming in the street. They tell him where Michael went, and Loomis follows, armed with a .357 Magnum handgun.

Laurie awakes in the Myers house, next to the gravestone of Judith Myers and the naked body of Lynda. Michael enters, placing his knife on the ground and taking off his mask. He kneels down and offers Laurie his picture of them as children. Laurie cries and tells him she doesn't understand, but then reaches for the knife and stabs Michael in the shoulder. Laurie slips away, but Michael corners her after she falls into a drained swimming pool. Loomis appears and shoots Michael three times. He falls, evidently dead. Loomis gets Laurie inside the police car, where Laurie asks, ""Was that the boogeyman?"" Loomis responds, ""As a matter of fact, I do believe that was."" Michael suddenly breaks through the window and grabs Laurie. Loomis chases after them, and tells Michael he was the one who failed by giving up on him. Michael lets Laurie go, and grabs Loomis, crushing his skull.

Laurie hides inside the Myers house as Michael drags Loomis's body inside. Michael searches for Laurie, smashing the frail walls. Laurie grabs Loomis's gun, and hides in the attic. Michael then grabs a plank of wood, and begins bashing it through the ceiling. Laurie nearly escapes, but falls through the ceiling into a bedroom. Michael enters the room, and as she raises the gun, he charges at her sending both through the second story window to the ground below. Laurie comes to, lying on top of an unconscious Myers and attempts to shoot him, but the first few shots are empty. Michael recovers, grabbing Laurie's hand as she shoots again. The gun fires, hitting Michael in the head. Laurie, covered with blood, screams in terror as the film abruptly cuts to credits.

  As I said before, Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 Horror classic, is simply outstanding. I was expecting a great remake, but this outstanding was not what I had expected. Out of all the Horror movies that were remade in the last few years, this is the best out of them all.",1188518400,4,10173,4.850316637881405
3176855,5,B000VKL6Z2,"The writing was on the wall. The past twenty years have seen remakes of such beloved horror classics like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""The Omen,"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; because of that, I guess the idea of remaking John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" was not so far fetched, after all. Of course, that got everyone wondering: Can this new version in any way, shape, or form live up to expectations? Having seen it, I can say without a doubt that the answer is yes. Quite frankly, this is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen, updating the original story into a dark, gritty, and stylistic fright fest. As far as remakes are concerned, I'd say that this is in the same league as John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or Marcus Nispel's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

Taking the reigns from Carpenter is Rob Zombie, who's first movie--""House of 1,000 Corpses""--gave the horror genre a rejuvenating boost. While the film itself was unfocused and derivative, it's style was eye catching; watching it, I knew that, if given the right material, Zombie would be the skillful horror filmmaker he set out to be. He's lived up to that potential with ""Halloween,"" a film that does a masterful job of updating--but not rehashing--the original 1978 film. Carpenter's version was brilliant in its ability to build tension, keeping masked madman Michael Myers hidden in shadow, having him strike at just the right moments. Zombie's version is also brilliant, but not in the same way: he gives the film a primal edge that perfectly captures the rage and evil that is Michael Myers.

This is a good thing, especially since Zombie has created a much more compelling and understandable Michael Myers back-story, beginning in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. As a ten-year-old boy (Daeg Faerch), Myers was disturbed, showing psychopathic behavior by hurting and killing animals. He also lived in a troubled household, with a verbally abusive stepfather (William Forsythe) and an uncaring, promiscuous older sister (Hanna Hall). The only person he loved--the only person who loved him back--was his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie), who earned a living as an exotic dancer. Everything changed fifteen years ago, on Halloween night; in a fit of rage, Myers savagely murdered his stepfather, his sister, and her boyfriend (both of whom refused to take him Trick-or-Treating).

Eleven months later, Myers was institutionalized at the Smith Grove Sanitarium and put under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). He noticed how disconnected the boy was from the world, seeming unaware of what he did, continuously covering his face with masks made out of paper and crayon. The murder of a nurse permanently closed him off, leaving his mother heartbroken and Loomis baffled.

The story then flashes forward to the present day. Now in his mid-twenties, Myers (Tyler Mane) is mute and obsessed with wearing masks. After learning that Loomis plans to stop all forms of therapy, Myers uses unnatural physical strength to escape during a patient transfer. His attacks are savage, using violence that's quick, raw, unnerving, and ultimately bloody (it should be noted that the aftermath of every murder is far gorier than anything seen in Carpenter's original film). After killing a truck driver in a rest stop bathroom and stealing his jumpsuit, Myers heads back to Haddonfield on Halloween, taking residence in his abandoned childhood home and covering his face with a dirty white mask hidden beneath the floor.

From here, the film effectively pays homage to many of the original film's subtler nuances. We meet Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends Lynda (Kristina Klebe) and Annie (Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Strode in the fourth and fifth ""Halloween"" sequels). The three are typical high school girlfriends: popular, pretty, and boy-crazy. Both Laurie and Annie spend Halloween night babysitting, which introduces us to young Lindsay (Jenny Gregg Stewart) and Tommy (Skyler Gisondo). Like the Tommy of the original film, this new Tommy is curious about the Boogyman, so much so that it begins to annoy Laurie.

As the film draws to a close, it becomes a taut, suspenseful ride, pitting the unlucky teenagers--primarily Laurie--against an incurable killing machine. If you haven't seen the original films, then I can't tell you why Laurie becomes his target; let's just say that the two are somehow connected. They play against each other during the final scenes, all of which crescendo to screaming heights. Zombie did not hold back in his attempts to frighten the audience, which is appropriate given the kind of film ""Halloween"" is. Just as Carpenter's original version defined the Teen Slasher film, Zombie's version defines creative reinterpreting; he took a well-established story and gave it some fresh blood, resulting in a frightening new film that respectfully pays tribute to its source (example: the inclusion of the original ""'Halloween' Theme""). If you appreciate the art of horror filmmaking, then Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the movie for you.",1188518400,11,5108,5.1704957678355505
3176856,4,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, I'm not sure this movie was worth four stars. It's more like 3.5, but considering that isn't an option, I'd rather give it half more than half less. Rob Zombie has made three movies in his career as a writer/director. The first was the cartoonishly over-the-top, ""sadistic"" (it wasn't) 'House of 1,000 Corpses', the highlight of which was Rainn Wilson as ""Fish Boy"". His second was 'The Devil's Rejects', an indirect sequel (meaning all it had in common was the same characters and actors) to 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. While 'Corpses' was more focused on being weird (the Dr. Satan underground climax; the apparently supernatural monsters), 'The Devil's Rejects' was focused on being an actual movie. The cartoonishness was gone, replaced by actually sadistic violence, likeable villains, and one of the most vile rape scenes but to film. Among all of that, it was a throwback to movies of the same genre from the 1970's. Zombie also directed one of the fake previews in the movie 'Grindhouse', though his, 'Werewold Women of the SS', was the second worst of the lot.

I am in no way a horror fan. Usually all the movies are the same, and there hasn't been an actual good horror movie for several decades. But Zombie's movies are different than the normal ""gross before scary"" horror being released in droves every weekend. That's why it was such a dissapointment, to me at least, that, among other admirable qualities, his 'Halloween' remake has very few chills. It's almost a normal slice-'n-dice horror movie, complete with naked women running around getting fileted for most of the third act.

The first two acts, both of which seriously deviate from the original 1978 classic, gives a back story on serial killer Michael Myers, which seriously deafens the impact of most of the terror later in the movie, the terror that was so present in the original. The biggest mistake was giving the killer a motive. Part of why the original was so scary was that it was just some crazy guy killing innocent teens. But here, in this one, the killer is made out to be a victim. His mother was a stripper, his father an angry ""cripple"", and his sister a promiscuous, careless teenager. The first act is spent almost entirely at the Myers' house, leading up to the massacre. Some of this is entertaining, such as Michael's mother (Sherri Moon Zombie, wife of the director), and Michael's father (William Forsythe) go-around in the opening minutes, mostly because of the incessent profanity. The rest, though, even the murders, are suprisingly boring and feel like there was nothing put into them.

The second act of the movie focuses on Michael in the sanitarium, under the watch of Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, in a role originated by Donal Pleasence in the original). Most of this segment, again, takes place in one location: the mental hospital. Michael's mother, the only one to escape the massacre, comes to visit him once a week, and alot of screen time is given to Moon-Zombie and her depression over loosing her entire family. In a nice detail, she looks much older and worse-for-the-wear in the second act than she did in the first. This act culminates in another massacre, and Myers' subsequent escape from the hospital.

The third act is spent in Haddonfield, Illinois, the setting of the original. There are the three girls, Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris), and Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart), just like in the original. There are the two kids, babysat by Compton and Harris, and there are the two respective boyfriends of Harris and Stewart. This segment of the movie, by far the shortest, is, ironically, the one that feels the longest. This is mainly due to the fact that it's basically a condensed version of the original. The four teens are killed off in the beginning of the segment, and the rest is the police and Loomis trying to get to Myers before he has a chance to kill Laurie, and chase scene between Myers and Laurie that, although long, is uninteresting. The only truly disturbing scene in the entire movie is Harris' death.

It's obvious that Zombie tried something different with his version of the movie, but it doesn't work out in his favor. Instead of the brisk pace and character development of 'The Devil's Rejects', Zombie goes overboard with blood and gore, of which the original had none. I know there was never a chance of this, but it would have been a great idea to cut out the prologue and go with the structure of the original, including leaving it bloodless. Again, I know there was never a chance of that, but it would have been interesting and, obviously, different from the norm. Ending on a positive note, Sherri Moon Zombie has to be the most attractive actress around, next to Katherine Heigl.

Runtime: 109 Minutes.

Rating: R, for strong brutal bloody violence and terror throughout, sexual content, graphic nudity, and language.",1188518400,6,4921,4.851190476190476
3176857,3,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, the original Halloween is my favorite horror film and I knew with Rob Zombie directing, things would get very twisted. The constant swearing (this coming from a guy who watched HBO's Deadwood) was way too frequent in the first twenty minutes. Thankfully that thinned out as the story progressed. It felt too much like the recent Texas Chainsaw remakes for my tastes. The acting wasn't as bad as most critics are saying and some of the dialogue actually made me laugh a bit. This is a very brutal movie to say the least. Even when Rob doesn't show a lot of gore, the way he films some of the murders is flat out disturbing (especially the ones involving young Michael).

I'm glad he kept the famous music and didn't shy away from showing some nudity. The MPAA seems to feel that showing a little skin is worse than peeling it off someone and deep frying it. What are these suits thinking?

The back story was nearly an hour long (1/2 hour too long) and the second half with the girls felt rushed. You just get to know them and in the next scene they are dead.

Overall, Rob didn't impress or disappoint me too much. This is really the kind of film I figured he would turn in. For me, I liked Michael Myers better as a mystery.",1188518400,3,1236,4.3652173913043475

3176878,2,B000VKL6Z2,"From the very start this looks and feels like a Rob Zombie film. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it reminded me more if HIS movies than the original Halloween. Myers' back story is believable, and yet somehow lacks impact. I was waiting for something out the ordinary to happen that would perhaps explain some of the Myers' motivations and behavior. I don't feel that the film delivered in that respect. This version of Halloween isn't as creepy as the original. Ironically, even though Meyer's back story was added, the whole movie feels like it lacking. It doesn't feel like an extension of the original movie. It almost feels like it's own, separate story, with a main character who also happens to be name ""Michael Myers.""

3176888,4,B000VKL6Z2,"It's rare that a reboot of any classic film is good by any standard, but this is the exception. Rob Zombie does an excellent job re-telling the story with his own vision in mind. The casting of Malcolm McDowell is inspired. In particular, the portrayal of young Michael Meyers by Daeg Faerch is downright chilling. The one criticism is that the first half and second half feel like they are two different films. However, the juxtaposition has its merits especially for true crime aficionados. The focus on Michael's early years and the psychological component is essential to his character development overall. In addition, it is a fascinating exploration into the mind of a true psychopath. The second half is where the real fun takes place and Zombie directs some fantastically horrific scenes. Yet, despite his murderous rampage, the viewer is still left trying to understand Michael's character and his motives. This is what perhaps makes Zombie's version stand out. The film epitomises the slasher genre, yet the jump scares and blood is not what is truly terrifying. Instead, we are left haunted by our attempt and failure to humanise a psychopathic killer.",1509667200,,1163,5.0625

3176890,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I am not going to waste anyone's time reviewing the movie. If you have seen it already, you know what it's about. Me telling people how good or bad it is won't change their idea about buying it. I AM going to describe the transfer and any extras on the disc. First off, the Blu-ray transfer is fantastic. It is incredibly sharp and clear. Clearer than any other Blu-Ray I own, and I have a bunch. And clearer than what you see on an HD channel on TV. It is that clear and bright. It does have bars on top and bottom, but that is because it is in 2.40:1. That is the original size of the movie and the only way they can fit ALL of it on a TV screen. I have a large screen (52 inch) plasma TV so it looked just fine that way.
The audio gave a choice of two types. Either one was clear and crisp. Not sure exactly what the difference between the two is, but I experienced no problems using either.
The deleted scenes on the disc were interesting, but I am not sure all of them are present. I have seen some scenes on YouTube from the movie that were NOT on the disc. One being a group of security guards who were assigned to move Michael Meyers from the original hospital to a less secure hospital. Michael made short and gruesome work of them. That scene is missing from the movie and deleted scenes.
It IS nice that the deleted scenes all have subtitles as an option. The second Halloween by Zombie didn't have that, and some of the the dialogue is hard to understand on his Halloween II. The second disc includes a 4 hour ""made for"" by Rob Zombie. Haven't watched it yet. All in all the Blu-Ry version is worth every penny I paid.",1509580800,,1630,4.145110410094637

They both gave us 2 different Michael Myers. Original kept us in a lot of suspense which is always good in horror films, the second one went in deeper. In the remake, we saw a deeper side of iconic killer, starting back when he was only a kid, leading up to his first kill, to the story showing us how any kid, if pushed hard enough, can become Michael Myers themself.

In  the end it's same ole some ole tons of awful dialogue followed by a crap story followed up by screaming and screaming and screaming to the point that you're head is hurting then gore that's not even used well and you get a slow whiny unwatchable Rob Zombie Presents Halloween and it's just as bad now 2016 as it was when i wasted 12.00 to see it in theaters,1481587200,,892,4.216374269005848

3177047,1,B000VKL6Z2,"The film cannot hold a candle to John Carpenters original movie.  It seems to me that the remake is trying too hard to be scary causing a reverse effect.  For one thing Michael Myers is much scarier as a normal sized male 6ft and skinny, not 6 foot 8, 290 lbs.  The blonde kid portraying Michael didn't look like Andre the giant as a grade schooler, so no way would he grow up to be that big.  Having Michael Myers be that huge makes him less scary.  Like Frankensteins monster people would spot him coming from a mile away.  He wouldnt be able to hide anywhere.  It was a problem for Halloween 4 as well having Linebacker Michael is less scary than your average person.

The original films version of Michael as a child prodigy from a normal average suburban loving home is a much more interesting premise than Michael coming from a white trash family.  The original film builds a lot of tension and left a lot of his back-story up to the viewers imagination.  In the remake Michael is bullied, but not to the tipping point where he would commit homicidal murder.

The psychiatric hospital breakout was utterly ridiculous.  Since when does Michael Myers have super human strength like Jason Vorhees in the later Friday the 13th movies?  That whole scene came off as comical nothing more.  Michael kills the guards and just happens to slowly walks out of the whole maximum security complex like a Sunday stroll in the park.

Another thing about the film that really bothers me is Michael not killing his sister Laurie onsite.  Since when would he just gather her up in his arms take her for a stroll around the block, Ludicrous Speed GO!!!!!  The Michael Myers from the original would have killed her instantly in a millisecond.

The body count is much higher in this film and you never really care about these characters in general.  It cheapens death in a way making it feel less final.  I think network TV shows are doing this far to often nowadays as well.  The original Halloween did not have a lot of blood, guts or gore, it was far more about the suspense with much better storytelling.  In this movie the gore is overboard as well once again giving us the opposite effect of scary.

I saw this film in the movie theater on its original run and when the movie finished walking out of the theater I thought man that sucked.  Now I am a fan of Rob Zombie.  I like Robs music and saw him in concert a few times and he puts on a great show.  I thought House of 1000 Corpses was not bad just a little above average.  I hated The Devils Rejects and thought it was stupid.  So lets hold the praise for calling Rob Zombie some great director.  He is not in the same league as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Alfred Hitchcock etc etc.

I would rate this film 1 to 1  stars.  It is definitely not worth your time or money.  It does nothing but tarnish the original Halloweens legacy.  Rob needs to learn that sometime less is more when it comes to horror movies.  The movie needed more suspense and less outright gore and a normal sized Michael Myers not Kane from the WWE.",1478649600,,3066,4.414285714285715

3177066,5,B000VKL6Z2,A lot of people disliked this film simply because it was a reboot of an iconic film. I thoroughly enjoyed Zombie's reimagining of this classic story.  The increased attention to the origins of Michael added a dimension I felt was lacking in the original.  He took a slightly different approach to the character of Michael as well as Dr Loomis.  It changed the flavor of the film but still kept the basic premise of the movie intact.  If you are one who feels that the original film should be inviolate then you won't like this movie.  If you enjoy a different take on a classic then this one is for you.,1478390400,2,603,4.396396396396397

Most of the first part of the movie goes into the child hood of Micheal Myers. The movie had a great plot also. I will say not more, I want this to be a spoiler free review.

Back-story was decent, Malcolm ""Macbeth"" McDowell phoned it in from a place completely devoid of emotional investment, and, the dead horse slasher cliche's all combined to render this a failed attempt artistically, that found monetary success cruising to the bank on the back of Carpenter's coattails.  Definitely Trick with very little Treat.",1477958400,,564,5.108695652173913

In this remake of a classic, Rob decides to go deep into the psyche of what makes Michael Meyes and unstoppable monster, hell-bent on killing everyone.... and he does that... by... revealing that... he was... bullied as a kid?  Really, Rob Zombie?  Nothing more sinister or other-wordly?  He was just bullied?  Okay. So like, 80% of Americans should all have the powers that Michael Meyer has, since almost everyone was bullied?  Gotcha. Great idea.

3177190,3,B000VKL6Z2,"This is definitely a case of ""Why was this made?""  Your familiar with the story, but here is a funny anecdote.  Around the time this movie came out, I saw an interview with Malcolm McDowell.  He was praising Sherrie Moon Zombie as being perfect for the role she played.  I thought, ""Oh, you're just saying that because she is the director's wife, and you're playing Hollywood butt-kissing.""  Then, I thought about what he said and the role Sherrie played, which is the role of a white trash stripper.  So, yes, I agree:  Sherrie Moon Zombie was PERFECT for this role!",1477612800,,567,4.61
3177191,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Watching this reminds one how good Carpenter's original was.  Zombie invites his audience to spend alot of time with the horribly dysfunctional family in which Michael grew into a little monster.  Later in the movie he wants us to regard the mother as loving--why then did she insist on inflicting a drunken brute on them as stepfather/live-in boyfriend?  The sanatorium to which Michael is consigned after he beats a bully to death, slices and dices the brute, kills his older sister's boyfriend, and slashes his older sister (after attempting to fondle her) takes security very laxly: they supply him with a fork with which he kills a nurse.  Zombie shows us two sadistic prison workers raping a young girl IN THE ADULT (and by now GIGANTIC) MICHAEL'S CELL.  Naturally he escapes, butchering bystanders on the way.  Carpenter frightened his audience, eventually making an ordinary couch and a broom closet terrifying.  Zombie disgusts.  Does he want his audience to reflect that, while watching the on-screen torture, they are behaving like Michael?  Who knows?  Amidst the mayhem one catches sight of competent actors earning a paycheck.  If they thought the world needed a remake of a classic, why didn't the financial backers of this sewer offer Carpenter enough money to reshoot his movie with better dialog?",1477612800,2,1314,5.093457943925234

3177197,1,B000VKL6Z2,This is terrible in every sense of the word. In this genre I like to think that a movie can be judged on how well it can scare people. This film fails to scare at all. There is no real sense of suspense or dread. The creators of this remake do not understand how to instill fear into the audiance. At best it is a low grade fill with lots of titillation factor to try and add to its appeal.,1477526400,2,390,3.8875
3177198,1,B000VKL6Z2,"What a terrible movie! What the F was Rob Zombie thinking?? He took a classic horror film and made it totally predictable and lame with terrible characters and a stupid story. Cmon, in the original Halloween, Dr. Loomis feared Michael and in this movie he calls Michael his best friend?!?! So stupid. The thing that made the original so good was you didn't have all the predictable and unnecessary backstory. Just stick to music Mr. Zombie because your movies suck.",1477526400,,465,4.825

3177218,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Visually, this movie is great. Rob Zombie is great at putting together a scene, and his cinematography is intense. The dialogue, however, is awful. Zombie also tends to be obsessed with sex scenes, as there are 3 of them in this, each one with completely different characters. This doesn't bother me but I can see it being off-putting or distracting to others. The backstory given to Michael Myers in this movie is also much weaker, and takes away from how much of a monster Michael is supposed to be. The acting is simply average, and the lead actress has nowhere near the charisma of Jamie Lynn Curtis in the original. If you enjoy good scary scenes and slasher movies, and aren't bothered by poor dialogue and average at best plot, then this movie is for you.",1477526400,4,762,4.610294117647059

This remake was more bloody and horrifying, and frankly, thought that it was better than the original in that aspect.

In its favor it did get better as the movie went on. It's just the entire beginning with the character development was just boringly predictable. I don't watch Robs movies because his characters all seem like the same stereotype in every movie that he does. It's like he gave all his metal head and wrestling and fetish friends roles in all his movies. And it's supposed to shock us, but it doesn't. It's boring and predictable when he does the slow close up of someones face that only his inner circle are supposed to recognise. I want to gag. The characters always act exactly the same. Oh here's a shouty violent stripper, here's a shouty violent drunk guy. Oh look here's some more shouty domestic violence. Oh look everyone has long hair and tattoos. Oh look at me I'm edgy, and wierd. You're not used to wierd, are you, average viewer? It's boring and it insults my boredom threshold.
How are we supposed to believe that there's some kind of quiet preternatural intelligence in Mike Myers character if his family are just morons? There are so many angles the character development and childhood plot could have gone in but instead we just got a pile of stupid. Easy way out. After the childhood scenes the movie got better.

3177475,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Now remember this is not the usual John Carpenter Halloween film. This is the a serial killer named Micheal Myers (based of a character of John Carpenter) and his life and family. Im not a fan of Rob Zombie as a director (his music though! Love it!) His movies have always been 60% porn, 35% gore, and %5 scary.

Personally any 'Horror Movies' now either put me to sleep (Better than a Tylenol PM), or have me in a fit of giggles. I'm kinda hard to scare now with all the films I've seen :(

Halloween is a good written movie. I absolutely love the first 30 minuets of it! (Don't worry No spoilers from me.) The ending kinda made me laugh, feel sad, and jump. all at the same time.

I would give it five stars the only thing that stopped it was too much recurring tit scene it felt like they paid a frat dude to stay on set I find scenes that they COULD have a topless chick in.",1475107200,4,878,4.093023255813954

3177493,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Just my opinions, but....this probably should have been a prequel to the classic Halloween instead of a remake. Even a movie based on the original classic. To take such a great classic and turn it into this is just SAD. Rob Zombie is too talented for this. Entirely too much $mut and domestic violence which can be left to the imagination if done properly. I tried to watch this a few years ago, and only made it to the second scene. I thought I'd try it again this evening, but again...I could not make it beyond the second scene. It is disturbing, especially being a remake of a terrific classic horror which gives a great feel of the true Halloween spirit.",1474675200,3,659,4.454545454545454

3177495,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Not sure where to start other than this film was bad from the get-go. I will say that I liked Rob Zombie's ""Devils rejects"" and ""House of a 1000 corpses,"" but this remake was atrocious. First things first, Zombie recycles his actors. It is a tad difficult to get into a movie when the same people show up in his films. Second, the whole part of what made Myers creepy and sinister was that we knew extremely little about him. He did not communicate with anyone in the original and that's what made it great. Zombie turns Myers into a momma's boy and a piece of trailer trash which ruins one of, if not THE, best characters in horror.",1474502400,,633,4.3277310924369745

3177525,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I admire the effort to provide insight into why Michael Myers is a crazed homicidal maniac, but it tries way too hard.  Even for horror movies, the acting is over the top.  Catpenter's original did not need a reboot.",1472774400,,216,4.512820512820513
3177526,4,B000VKL6Z2,I don't care- Rob Zombie makes great horror films. Sit back and enjoy this objectively and have a good horror film experience.

Being a huge horror fan I was disdained in what other directors did to damage the reputation of other slasher films like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street. Zombie not only did a great job on staying true to the core story but also added a back story to how Michael Myers grew up. Casting was great Tyler Mane who plays Michael Myers.

3177569,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Well,"" loved it"" are  not exactly the words I would use when describing my feelings about this film. However, I gave it a five because it was very good. Of course, my favorite is the original Halloween. This movie is brutal and gory with full front nudity. Some parts are brutally gory and rather savage. However, what else would you expect from Rob Zombie? The take on Michael Myers childhood would fit the development of the full blown violent psychosis he lived with. At least the part about the small animal torture that he practiced and the bullying that he endured. As far as his family structure and the other families in this film; they were all twisted in some way, so I consider the representation just a tongue and cheek satire on the American family, and the American teen. Rob Zombie wanted to do his take on ""Halloween"" and did a darn good job on it.  He was able to put on film what he envisioned as his style of an old favorite.

However, this movie is definitely not for little kids. It would give them nightmares and the contents can be viewed as inappropriate.",1468022400,,1079,4.494897959183674

3177575,5,B000VKL6Z2,Normally I am not a fan of remake of a classic film. Robbie Zombie put a great take on the original Halloween film. Like that this version allows us to know more about Michael Myers. In this version we learn why Michael returns home. In the original had no idea Laurie was his baby sister. Lots of surprises and twist in this film so that it's fresh. While I really enjoyed this version there is only one Laurie Strode and that's Jamie Lee Curtis. Still it's really exciting heck Robbie Zombie involved in it...,1467331200,,511,4.446808510638298

3177578,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a very visceral, brutally honest remake and homage to the 80s horror classic that, though predictably scary, is a fun film to enjoy on a dark and stormy night. There is something to be said about a child who grows up in an abusive household and who develops a penchant for animal sadism, which evolves in a full-on blood lust. The first half of this film takes an uncompromising look at Michael's upbringing and ultimate abandonment in a mental health facility, where he descends into a morass of seething rage and hatred of life.

The drama (struggle) of his character is very clear; you know and understand beyond any doubt, WHY he became a psychopath to begin with. Rob Zombie (of White Zombie rock fame) does a great job with this movie, pushing his previous B style flops to the background with a monster of a thriller as beefy as Michael Myers himself.

The campy coming-of-age and horniness teen slasher has come full circle, blending in the obligatory (and predictable) teen sexuality and primal fear that made 80s slasher flicks cult classics. This SHOULD be the last remake; it is well made, well written, and enjoyable.",1466899200,,1138,4.742424242424242

Just a story that didn't make a lot of sense, some jump scares, boobs just for the sake of having boobs in there, an uncomfortable rape scene that didn't even seem to be necessary to the plot just plain disturbing, mediocre performances with the exception of Tyler Mane who definitely fit the role well but was misused, and awful dialogue. I'll give this movie the benefit of the doubt and say that the first act with the origin of Michael at ten years old was exceptional. It was scary and not just disturbing, set up the movie and it's characters, and gave a look on what the motivations are by the main character. But after that, there wasn't much to cover that was either interesting or even original. So mediocre it made me sad, and I needed to watch comedy to feel better. That hardly ever happens.

Its a different take on the whole thing as it gives us a look at Michael's childhood.  This kind of movie is always going to have the blood and guts factor but in this one I think it was done well, not too much and not too gross.  The only thing, which is typical in a lot of movies, is the animal deaths.  At least we don't have to watch them get killed but I could have lived without it.  Otherwise, great movie!

3177612,4,B000VKL6Z2,"We all know how horror remakes usually go. I mean we live in an era where almost every single horror movie is either a remake or a sequel, so clearly originality is running thin these days and I usually like to say that if it was good the first time, leave it alone. With that being said, Rob Zombie actually didn't do a horrible job. Yes, there were a lot of things that were lacking but one thing I have to absolutely applaud is the superior casting. The cast of this movie was absolutely outstanding. Sheri Moon Zombie, William Forsythe, Hanna Hall, and Daeg Faerch made probably the best possible Myers family you could possibly find. I mean all of this can make you perfectly understand why Michael would become the killer he is. The broken household and Michael's obsession with torturing and killing animals are textbook serial killer signs. The transformation is so easy to understand and so that was done really well. The movie does feel a little short and rushed and there is a lot left to be desired but honestly for a remake this is a pretty visionary film for the stigma that horror remakes get these days for good reason.",1464393600,,1135,4.541463414634146

3177733,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I love this movie!  It's one of my favorite Halloween movies.

Rob Zombie takes John Carpenter's original Halloween and makes it his own, making it more violent, re-creating the characters his way, and adding a backstory and a motive for Michael to kill.  In this version, he is abused and bullied, lives in a broken home and the only one who cares for him is his mom.  The first half of the movie is him as a kid committing the murders and then goes through his time in the insane asylum.  Before this came out, the last time we saw Michael Myers was when he was getting beaten through martial arts by Busta Rhymes in Halloween: Resurrection.  Where do you go with him from there?

The characters are great in my opinion.  I like Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode more than Jamie Lee Curtis because she is more relatable in these movies because I'm the agenow as these characters are in the movie, and Scout reacts to her situation with Michael much like I would think someone would if it happened now.  Unlike the original, where Dr. Loomis shoots Michael and it ends, this time, Laurie has to take on Michael herself at the end, which helps add to her character.  Tyler Mane as Michael Myers is great.  He is more brutal than he has been in the past, and I like that.  I like the mask because in real life, it would rot after sitting around for 17 years.  Malcolm McDowell is as good a choice for Dr. Loomis as anyone would be.  I think he does a great job in this movie.  Danielle Harris comes back from the original series this time as Annie, and she does a good job with her role.  Brad Dourif is great as Sheriff Brackett.  Sheri Moon Zombie is good as Deborah Myers.  You really feel sorry for her about her family situation and feel sad about what happens after her family is murdered and Michael is locked up.  Daeg Faerch is good as young Michael and he is kind of creepy at times.  The whole cast does an excellent job in their roles.

The only negative thing I can say about the Unrated version is Michael's escape scene.  The Theatrical version's escape scene where he kills the guards is a lot better than the Unrated version's, which is a rape scene.

The 3-Disc Unrated Collector's Edition that I have comes with the commentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending, bloopers (Which are funny and entertaining), the theatrical trailer, and featurettes: The Many Masks of Michael Myers; Meet the Cast; Casting Sessions; and Scout Taylor-Compton Screen Test.  The third disc comes with a 4 1/2 hour documentary, Michael Lives: The Making Of Halloween, which goes through from pre-production to the end of post-production.  It's a neat and insightful documentary.

This is one of the most underrated movies in the Halloween series.  When I want to watch a Halloween movie, I frequently watch Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II, then Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and the original Halloween.  Rob Zombie's Halloween is grittier, more brutal and violent, and I enjoy it every time I watch it.  I don't care what people say about these movies, I love them.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and this is mine.

EDIT:

I bought the Theatrical version that has the much better alternate escape scene where Michael kills the guards while being transferred.  Because of the escape, I like the Theatrical version more than the Unrated version.  The Theatrical DVD comes with the same special features as the Unrated version except it doesn't have the documentary.",1451606400,,3494,4.6644844517184945

3177736,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Why do modern remake film makers feel the need to explain away every nuance and mystery of the original?  Zombie has talent as a filmmaker, when he is not preoccupied with creating scenes of violence and rape of naked women for his amusement. Tyler Mane as the grown-up Shape is the best part of the film. Unfortunately, he does not appear until the last 45minutes of the movie.",1451088000,,378,4.5588235294117645

3177738,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This is an excellent remake. Unfortunately it takes the story in a different direction than the original. Giving Michael a back story definitely adds a psychological twist.

3177739,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I personally love the Halloween franchise, but this one is a different story... His childhood was an okay part of the movie, but it took half of the movie away.

3177740,1,B000VKL6Z2,Just like all of Rob Zombie's movies all the dialogue is loud complaining. If I wanted to hear white trash bitch and moan for 2 hours I'd just go to Walmart and steal somebody's Cheetos.,1449878400,3,186,4.3428571428571425
3177741,4,B000VKL6Z2,"If you don't care for Rob Zombie the filmmaker, I don't know why you buy his films and then complain after you watch them. As a fan of Zombie, I found this remake better than most remakes and no one portrays the white trash culture better than Rob Zombie. The Unrated edition contains over 7 minutes of footage the MPAA made him cut out in order to receive an R-Rating and also contains some exposition that fleshes-out the characters. There are also a ton of cameos (some which are no longer with us), which is another Zombie trait. Zombie has been a horror fan since he was a kid and I find his style infecting. All the haters should just move on and watch PG-13 drivel like TWILIGHT or THE HUNGER GAMES franchises. If it's violence and over-the-top dialogue you want, Zombie is your man. I found this ""re-imagining"" clever and it in no way diminishes John Carpenter's version. You can always purchase the 10 different versions of that film on DVD. It's not like they took it off the market to make way for Zombie's version. There is enough room for both versions.",1449532800,,1066,4.5

Seeing Michael go from a troubled boy to a maniac and breaking out of the psych ward is enjoyable.  So, the 1st half gets 5 stars from me.
The 2nd half of the movie is where Michael returns to Haddonfield and it's pretty much typical Halloween/horror genre from there on out.  Michael kills all his baby sisters friends and then takes her prisoner until he is finally killed by multiple bullets...you know in horror movies multiple shots only takes the killer down long enough to let your guard down again.  I'll give the 2nd half 3 stars, so a combined score of 4.",1447286400,,721,4.350746268656716

3177821,5,B000VKL6Z2,Rob Zombie is at the top of his game with this gritty reboot of a horror classic.,1447027200,,81,3.823529411764706
3177822,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm one of millions who think the original is a classic! So, I wasn't expecting much. This is one film I'd classify as a re-imagining, more than a remake.  Definitely, a totally different approach from Carpenter. One of the reasons Michael was so menacing was the mystery of why he became such a Monster. The question of nature versus nurture was never involved in any explanation of Michael.
  Rob Zombie gives his reasoning for the madness of Michael Myers. It's interesting, different, and much more bloody than the original. It does take some of the mystique away from the character, but it serves the modern day blood lust of today's viewers. And, in the world in which we live, this seems very real!
The young Michael is my favorite part of the film. The  kid looks psychotic!  I would lock my doors if he came Trick or treating!  The only downside is Sherry Moon.  A terrible actress who hurts an otherwise, better than expected reimagined classic.",1447027200,,955,4.716867469879518

3178038,2,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, Halloween did not need to be remade.  Considering that Rob Zombie is a fan of the horror genre, I thought his take would be a little more interesting.

I can't say whether this film is good or bad.  The prologue is vulgar and needless, but the scenes in the hospital are well-done.  There are scenes of visual elegance smashed into very clumsy, brutal stuff.  It seems as if you are watching two films- one a modern slasher, with prolonged deaths and gratuitous nudity, and the other a reinterpretation of a classic in the same style.  All the white trash antics seem out of place, and the violence is not frightening so much as painful, but when Michael is haunting the streets on Halloween night, some semblance of the film  that could have been shines through.

I am one of the rare few who appreciate the sequel, as I think it finds the harmony between Zombie's formal leanings and the blunt nature of his style.  This one, not so much.",1446249600,,951,4.514619883040936

3178042,5,B000VKL6Z2,"As remakes go, this is one of the best I've ever seen.  It builds on the terror of John Carpenter's original vision and fleshes it out with many more diverse and interesting characters.  It's definitely a grave mistake to raise a budding psychopath in an environment fraught with bullying as well as physical and mental abuse; it's the formula for the creation of a true monster.  Zombie's method of introducing the viewer to more of young Michael's ""less than ideal"" home life and childhood provides some foreshadowing of the grisly consequences to follow.

3178047,4,B000VKL6Z2,Sort of interesting reboot of the Halloween movies with a different take on Michael Myers. The brunt of the movie is the childhood Michael had and pretty much what makes him tick.

I feel Rob Zombie has really grown as a director (House of thousand corpse looked like a music video) and then the Devils Rejects happened.

If you want to see naked teens getting stabbed to death, then you can't go wrong here with this Halloween reboot.

3178114,3,B000VKL6Z2,"SPOILER ALERT:  90 minutes into the movie, I was anxious to return and give this movie a 5 star rating!  Unfortunately, I watched the final 30 minutes.  It fell apart.  Michael takes the girl to the old house.  When she wakes and tries to escape, all doors are locked, chained, etc.  When she finally gets outside, there's a fence.  Locked and chained.  She gets by that, to find herself... in a graveyard?  This one even has a huge hole (I guess for mass burials )into which she of course falls.  With Dr. Loomis' help, she escapes - temporarily, and while Michael is gouging the doctor's eyes out, she runs back into the house.  Once she's inside, there's again no way out. ??? Michael drags Loomis inside - and the blood on him has totally disappeared (as has the bullet holes the dr. had put in Michael's clothes). The girl has the gun.  At one point, she's about a foot away and concealed from Michael - but she doesn't fire.  She crawls through a hole in a wall barely large enough to fit through - ignoring the much larger a hole a foot higher.  She gets to the attic and, hearing her, Michael starts to destroy the ceiling, thus the wood beneath her.  Yet only when she escapes to a section of the attic Michael hasn't touched - does the floor give way and she falls through!  The doctor wakes up, and some of the blood has returned, along his left cheek. His eyes are fine.  Michael comes face to face with the girl, and again she doesn't fire.  So he charges, and both go over the open balcony (recall there was no way out?) and hit the ground.  Bullets and clubs don't harm him, but the fall knocks Michael out cold.  And the small teenager recovers first!  She finally deigns to fire, but the gun fails to go off - three times.  Did the dr., who earlier bought the gun, fail to load it fully?? Only 3 shots have been fired!  But no... just as the police show up (who called them?) and Michael wakes, she fires once more - and blows Michael's head off.  My suggestion? Watch the first 90 minutes.  It's great!  But, sadly, the final 30 minutes are enough to lose it 2 stars.",1445731200,,2085,4.322997416020672

In this respect, Carpenter is one of the lucky ones. I am a fan of the original, and I guess that's what ruined it for me. At least Zombie didn't mess much with Carpenter's original score, which is about the only positive thing I can take away from this flick. Zombie ""treats"" his audience likes idiots who need every little facet spelled out for them; he leaves little room for suspense and imagination.

I simply turned it off and never even watched the rest of it.  Instead we got out Empire of the Sun, which the little cousins absolutely loved.

The first half of it, following young Micheals (beautifully played by Daeg Faerch) genesis into an unstoppable killing machine is a tour de force and one of the best things ever put on film genre wise. For this the movie would have deserved a 5 star rating. But after this genious excursion into true terror the movie became a poor copy of the (in my opinion not very frightning, or scary, or suspensful) John Carpenter film. So the second part would have deserved a 1 star rating, so I tried to find some middle ground here. I'm a big fan of Rob Zombie`s work (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects) and in the first half of this film he showed us what he is capable of. Unfortunately he wasted  an opportunity in creating something that the original film (again: in my opinion for no reason) is always labeled with: a true masterpiece of horror film making.",1431993600,4,909,4.4431137724550895

Even though Zombie's sequel to this remake was somewhat lack luster, it still was good enough for me to say I wish Rob Zombie would at Least finish the Halloween series.

Rob Zombie removed anything truly horrorifying that was put together in the original movies and tried to add a explanation of why this actually happened from beginning to end losing any real reason why this should be considered a horror movie & instead be a lame attempt at a documentary on the effects of bad parenting, drugs, abuse, etc. could have on children in the household.

3178330,5,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, let me say that if you want to experience the original John Carpenter Halloween movies, those still exist in all their glory. This movie does not in any way tarnish what was made before.

I prefer to think of the Zombie films as wholly unique. They are a different story.

The original Halloween presented us with Michael Meyers as the living embodiment of pure evil, a faceless menace with no conscience who could not be killed and had no human motivation.

Zombie, on the other hand, presents us with a sociopathic child, bred in a dysfunctional environment, his evil both biological and environmental.

I like both incarnations of the monster.

I give this movie 5 stars primarily because of the first half hour or so. I really enjoyed seeing the Meyers backstory. I also enjoyed the way Meyers was so visceral. The scene in the truckstop bathroom comes to mind, where Meyers pounds the trucker through a seemingly solid stall partition, and we see the metal buckle and warp with each maniacal hit. Meyers is a giant, powerful manifestation of darkness, come to wreak havoc on the world.

After the beginning, the movie becomes more of an homage to the original than a treading of new ground, devolving into typical horror movie tropes. However, these tropes are executed and acted well.

The movie is far better than the average slasher film, that's for sure.

How does Loomis leave her alone with him?  How do they give him a metal fork?  The reporter says ""the most gruesome murders since Manson.""  So they cant put 2+2 together?  Comon.

3178418,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been a Halloween fan since the 1978 original version. I was a kid when I first saw them so to put Daeg Faerch in as the role of young Michael Myers, was fantastic. Great to have the kid's point of view. He is captivating in the movie, from his genetics, body language, tone of voice. Perfect.

I have had mixed feelings about Rob Zombie in the past. I used to love his music but then got older and grew out of that trend. Then, I saw some of his newer movies and found them disjointed and a bit confusing. He does have a great sense of humor though, but I (mistakenly) thought that this element would take over this movie in a far too overwhelming way. However, this movie brings Rob justice as well as his wife Sherry Moon Zombie. She's actually a great actress along with being supremely beautiful.

I love that the choice to delve deeper into Michael's past was a large part of the movie because to all Halloween fans, I believe I can safely say that, we all wondered what exactly happened there but very little was discussed. I was quite impressed that there were elements that were completely validated by science: Michael was killing small animals for a time, quite angry, a social outcast and hid this all under his mother's nose. His broken family with little boundaries sexually of course can damage psyche as well. This is true to psychological and psychiatric assessments of early (as in budding) serial killers, but Rob is very smart so I am not surprised, just grateful.

I was truly overjoyed to see Danielle Harris return to the Halloween series after being in Halloween 4 and 5. There are very many scenes and lines that I was smiling about because they were so close to being taken from the original one. Rob Zombie paid great respect and tribute to the original.

My final thought but my most important is that I actually LIKED Michael in this. He was a sympathetic character as well as being a bad ass. Great job Rob Zombie!!!!",1414886400,2,1953,4.492957746478873

Some of the characters are annoying, but they're meant to be that way. A couple of things surprised me. It was interesting to see so much of Michael as a boy. I think all of the actors/actresses did a great job. I was glad to see more than one survivor at the end (but don't get too attached to everyone who survives if you watch the sequel).

While I appreciated the deeper perspective into Michael Myers, and how evil manifested itself within him, I felt the movie was nothing more than a illustration of profanity and gratuitous violence. What made the original such a classic was how John Carpenter used pacing, time and classic story telling to tell his story. To weave the audience into the film in a manner that was reflective of his inspiration. One Alfred Hitchcock.

Unfortunately for Mr. Zombie, his playbook is deeply and profoundly flawed. A playbook in which the usual was employed as a substitute for what makes a great film. Horror or otherwise. Good characters, a good storyline and a plot that amounts to something more than a collection of horrible actors drenched in a derived, blood soaked mess. In short, this movie was nothing more than a piece of garbage. Garbage undeserving of carrying the moniker of its superior predecessor. Don't waste your time....",1414713600,,1001,4.923076923076923

Now we all know that the franchise has long gone down the tubes and yet here we are again with these remakes. I consider them more to be like reimaginings of the two good movies, Halloween 1 and 2. Here he wants to go into the back story of Michael Myers and make the movie more about him. What he doesn't understand is that we don't want to go into the back story of Michael Myers. It's like showing too much of the shark in Jaws or too much of the Xenomorph in Alien. He doesn't get the appeal of the movies. Which makes you scratch your head because he's such a fan of the original cult film. This is the problem with all these remakes and movies in general. They show too much, they try to go too deep and they end up making a laughable exaggerated version of something that shouldn't be touched to begin with. Bringing on some good actors will only help this whole mess so much. At its surface its a harmless remake. Everyone knows these movies suck.

3178461,4,B000VKL6Z2,"What can I say? The Original Horror movie has been a fascinated me since I was a a child. From the music, the way it was filmed, the low budget, the cast, and even the sequels. It changed my life along with the original Universal Monster and forever turned me into a Horror Movie Junkie who now attends conventions. With that being said I wasn't upset when I heard one of my favorite musical performers and directors would be remaking this film. I wasn't even skeptical, I loved House of 100 Corpses for its campyness and insanity, AND the Devil's Rejects for its grit and badass tendencies. I guess I'm one of the few who actually doesn't mind remakes(I really disliked the ""Psycho"" remake), I enjoy seeing a fresh perspective on things especially when they pay homage to the original. I dunno, I can separate the two in my head and nothing gets ruined for me.

Adapt or Die

So now the film. I Liked the back story (It's funny, before this film I would hear people say ""I wish I knew his back story!"" than after this film I heard the same people say ""Who cares about his back story it ruins everything!"" The hypocrisy is astounding here) I liked the casting. I loved how many scenes were filmed on the same Pasadena streets as the original and how Rob Zombie had to use fake leaves that they made and would have to rake them up, just like John Carpenter had done nearly 30 years prior. And finally, the mask was great too, I always thought the way the masks looked in Halloween 4,5,6,7,8 were lacking compared to the original first two films. This made me happy. The more people I talk to about this film, the more I hear about how much they actually love it as time goes by. Besides... lets be honest.. After the first 2 films, The rest of the Halloween series got very bland and corny, 4,5,6,7,8? 4 and 5 are filled with 80's cheese (not that that's a bad thing, I love it, but these are so dated and all the fear of Michael Myers that I had was gone) 6 was the first Halloween film I saw in the Theaters and brought back some of the childhood fears I had of some slasher invading my home and trying to kill me (lol). 7:H20 was very nostalgic with the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, and 8...??? ""Trick or Treat Motherfucker? Nah man. I remember watching that and holding my head saying ""My favorite franchise is dead.""

Than this happened. Raw, gritty, and finally something I didn't feel like I was wasting my money on. Of all the recent remakes, this is by far my favorite, I don't really even think of it as a remake in my head anymore, In my mind its just ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". Kudos Rob Zombie! P.S. I even Liked the sequel, go with the directors cut of both films) Enjoy!

Also the way Laurie acts with her parents? are you kidding me? find me six ""good"" girls who talk to their parents like that and make those kinds of jokes, they dont. They turned one of her friends into a bitchy nasty trashy chick who you almost rooted for the  death of same with the oldest sister. I personally loved in the original how michael didn't have a reason to go bad, he simply was. Some people simply are born bad. I believe that they don't need a tragic back story of living in a dumpy house with a trashy family a mom who is blind to how screwed up her kids are etc... I think michael myers as a five year old who murders his older sister and her boyfriend just because is extremely more disturbing than the ten year old who is bullied everywhere he goes that eventually just snaps but some how restrains from killing his mother and baby sister. also the age time line in this movie doesnt make sense. In the beginning of the movie Laurie is supposed to be 1 at most but 15 years later she is a senior in high school? not to mention we go from the 70s to the late 90s/early 2000s? Also I don't know anyone who talks the way zombie constantly has his characters speak. cussing everyother word? I have never met a single person without the help of alcohol who speaks like that. I suggest skipping this movie unless you just like watching teenagers die horribly gory ways. the added back story at the beginning was a good idea but took away from the horror that is Michael Myers. a ""boy so evil neither heaven nor hell would have him""",1413590400,,1701,4.282608695652174

Everything else that came with that ruined what little fun I had with a more maniacal Michael Myers. Rob Zombie did not handle this story well at all. I don't like how he tried to make Michael into a product of a harsh environment. The Allure of Michael Myers (for me anyways) was always the enigma. No one knows what made him snap the first time. Mr. Zombie destroyed that. On the plus side, Danielle Harris returns to Haddonfield, which is a nice little bonus.",1412985600,,744,4.321428571428571

Remakes really have to go in a new direction to ever work.  Here they try setting up a realistic back story for the killer Michael Myers.  It didn't work for me.  Anyone who has seen the original knows that a good part of the fun is the fact that a murderer with a knife, who is killing teenagers on Halloween, turns out to be supernatural entity. That's how a 6'4"" guy wearing a creepy mask gets to lurk on sidewalks in the middle of day, that's how he can fade in and out of shadows, that's why he can take six gun shots and get up and disappear. By going the realistic route and still have Michael Meyers do all these things, the movie comes off a bit ridiculous.

Beyond the central problem with the story, I thought the acting was better than you'll find in most horror movies these days, and, strangely enough, once the movie gets past its new origin story, the second half does effectively ramp up the tension and brutality in the later scenes to good effect.

I know studios are contractually obligated to make movies because they'll lose the copyright, but the best of this remake should have been a new property.",1412380800,,1239,4.412280701754386

I like that we get to see more of Michaels childhood, but the brutal, biker/stripper/neglectful/trailer trash upbringing was a bit of a stretch from the original. The original painted Michaels home life as a very normal, white bread suburban one, which made his murderous break from reality as a child even that much more disturbing. I felt they spent a little too much time on Michael and Dr. Loomis' relationship in the mental hospital and not enough time on Michaels calculated stalk of Laurie, which was among the best suspense sequences of the genre for its time. Overall I thought Rob Zombie did a good job, but some of it was a bit over the top for Halloween and horror genre purists like myself.

so when i heard about this remake by Rob zombie i didn't think much of it at all
i thought it was an insult to the original classic
just like it was insult for Platinum Dunes Production to remake NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST
i decide to rent it from my Local Video store just to check it out
i rented the UNRATED version which has extra scenes in it
the whole film is Different from John carpenter's version so not all Halloween fans will like it
Rob zombie wrote the script aswell as Directing it
in the script Michael myers mother SHERI MOON ZOMBIE is included in the plot which i don't think was necessary for the story
there are more scenes of Dr Loomis treating Michael myers at the Mental Hospital
the Actress who played Laurie strode in this film SCOUT TAYLOR-COMPTON
thought she over done the acting for the role
about half way through the film i lost interest, i'm to much big a fan of John carpenter's version
to give this remake a chance
John carpenter's version is a classic there should've never been a remake in the first place
this version is definitely an acquired taste of film so not all Halloween fans like myself will like it.
i might as well talk about the rest of the blu-ray which are the special features
Disc 1 has lots of featurettes,
RE-IMAGINING HALLOWEEN & MEET THE CAST featurette's, plus Bloopers and Audio commentary
Disc 2 has 4hour on the set footage of the making of the film

Unlike the original I felt no sympathy towards his little sister mainly because of her attitude.
I did like how they got more into the back story of Micheal and I find Rob Zombie to be a pretty good director overall.",1411171200,2,509,4.151515151515151

so, i revisited rob zombie's halloween. i hated it the first time i saw it, but now, seven years later, i hafta confess i have much more positive feelings about rob's grimy 70's-inspired revisit to haddonfield. there is a lot going for this movie, and there are some troubling things against it. ultimately, i think it works, particularly as rob seeks to give michael myers some impetus for being the way he is. i feel content to consider this movie on its' own, free from comparison to carpenter's brilliant original. rob zombie did not direct john carpenter's halloween; he directed rob zombie's halloween.

i really enjoyed seeing little kid michael myers this time around. daeg faerch does a tremendous job portraying a troubled little boy whose lack of empathy makes it easy for him to kill brutally. while it's predictable to see him torturing animals and surrounded by family dysfunction, it makes sense. he was a kid, and he had to start somewhere. i appreciate the clear message that cruelty to animals leads to more cruelty, and it kind of touches my soul that despite rob's penchant for on-screen sadism and cruelty, he's clearly an animal advocate. we get michael's first foray into killing, as he dispatches a handful of folks who he doesn't particularly care for, leaving only himself and his infant sister.

in these early scenes, i really dug seeing little michael receive counsel from dr. sam loomis, who is wonderfully played by malcolm mcdowell. mcdowell is not donald pleasance. his sam loomis is at once more connected with michael, and more self-serving, as well. he really cares about michael, and is somewhat heartbroken when his efforts fail to get through. the scenes shared by mcdowell and faerch are natural and well-written. i found that they augmented my understanding of michael myers, and actually made him kind of sympathetic. while he is very much a psychopath, or merely a ""shape of a human"", as loomis cleverly observes, zombie's michael has more in common with frankenstein's monster than with the very essence of evil. i mean, i'm pretty sure he's evil, too, but unlike in the prior series, this michael is human and has impulses. he's trying to figure out who is, what's going on, and who's left that he connects with (i.e. that he didn't kill). i also like michael's obsessive mask-making, and the masks themselves are very much zombie, which makes me appreciate the hand he has in the visual aesthetic of this movie.

i feel i must stick-up for the very beleaguered and hard-working sheri moon-zombie, who is fantastic as an overwhelmed mother in a world well out of her control. she loses everything, and still visits michael and tries her best to love him. i believed her pain.

so, we fast forward to the present, and see teenager laurie strode, nee angel myers, who is growing-up in a loving household, filled with people who genuinely care about one another. this stands in stark contrast to the chaos of her infancy, and dee wallace and pat skipper are excellent as laurie's stable family. the interactions between the strode's is natural and loving, foreshadowing poor laurie's locomotive of heartbreak. scout tayler-compton does a nice job of establishing who she is when spewing crude sexual taunts at her mother (ah, rob, you're incorrigible) and then lovingly helping her fix a plastic skeleton. she may be virginal, but she's real.

another delight i took in this viewing was appreciating the relationship between laurie and the children she's babysitting. again, despite his insane level of violence, rob brings a compassionate and clever hand when working with children. laurie is a babysitter who really enjoys working with kids and it shows. the children themselves are hilarious when needed, and terrified at others. they were great. it's also refreshing to see again that in rob zombie's world, ten year-old modern day kids will sit in rapt attention while watching old black and white movies. we see snips from white zombie and the thing, of course. this led me to think that perhaps michael myers dresses as he does in a nod to james arness in everybody's favorite 50's science fiction flick.

halloween is loaded with great performers, from sid haig to ken foree, to danny trejo, who gets, outside of spy kids, a rare sympathetic role. we also see leslie easterbrook, bill mosely, sybill danning, daniel roebuck, richard lynch, and udo kier, among others, in great cameos. the rest of the cast is excellent, including brad douriff as sheriff bracket, and danielle harris,, little jamie from halloween 4 and 5, as his daughter, annie.

and annie brings me to the main problem with zombie's halloween, and it's a big one. she fights and claws and scratches, but her dramatic scene of violence features her topless. earlier, kristen klebe is killed completely nude, and michael's sister is also killed with little clothing on. in general, i have no issue with how rob zombie portrays or writes women, and i don't at all believe that he's a misogynist, but three naked or partially naked women killed in one movie is a definite red flag. throw in a repugnant and unnecessary rape scene in the unrated director's cut (i am not very tolerant of rape in movies, so if it's in there it damn well better be central to the plot; don't play lightly with those intentions or images), and halloween starts to display, for me, some troubling vibes. these moments distracted from what was otherwise an excellent movie, i thought, and they nag at me now. what makes it even crazier is that, in addition to the clear link between animal cruelty and increased violence, there are several lines of dialogue that rail against corporate greed, class inequity, and poor treatment of the mentally ill, so it doesn't really figure why rob's got this movie loaded with so much needless intersection of violence and sexuality. michael may be repressed ( i assume), but, other than an early scene of him creepily caressing his sisters leg, little is suggested that he's acting out sexually. anything but, really, and he does show compassion and restraint here and there. my hope is that rob directed those scenes with visions of last house on the left (where those horrid sequences were central to the plot and the purpose of the movie) or old nazi prison flicks. but please, rob, beware. i love your use of homage, but don't do it blindly. you're much too smart and too good. i tolerated that sh** in devil's rejects, cus it fit, but it doesn't really fit here.

this movie is brutal, and this michael myers is shockingly violent, and becomes even more so in the superior sequel. tyler mane's size is just astounding, and he moves with strength and power and forcefulness. he is unrelenting bulk, and i think he was cast well and did a great job.

halloween features great music, great make-up (wayne toth, you rock!), great set design, and a great camera. rob captures illinois in the fall, and creates a creepy halloween atmosphere. the cast is fantastic. it meanders a bit at the end, and even with it's potentially troublesome sexual politics, i think rob zombie has successfully explored and executed his conception of michael myers and the halloween mythos. and the final sequence, in its' schockingness, is an absolute scream, baby.",1406505600,2,7296,4.890864995957963

This is one serious piece of fanfic. We finally get to see the development of Michael Myers into the monster who scared us all in the original Halloween, as imagined by one of the sickest minds in showbiz (luv ya, Rob!).
Zombie totally discards the demon possession/witchcraft theories spun about for years (and featured in Halloweens 4 and 5) in favor of the child driven deep into psychosis by his abusive stepfather and the negative and violent environment in which he was imprisoned.
My only gripe is that he never did a sequel. In one scene Michael's sister tells her boyfriend that her real daddy (and Michael's) was in Heaven. Maybe Michael's twisted mind also had a genetic marker?

3178590,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Firstly, let me say that I am not a Halloween fan. I am a Nightmare/Freddy fan, but never Halloween. Ever. Always hated it, since I was a young pup. I'm also a Rob Zombie fan. I was in no hurry to see this, but since Lords of Salem was unavailable on Redbox, I went to Amazon. I was 'settling' for Halloween. And dubious, but willing to be entertained.
This movie is very much like bicycling on a steep hill. The beginning is so slow and trudging, you have time to get impatient, and start making judgements about the film as a whole. At an apex, suddenly you're flying and its all downhill! What?? It's Halloween!! How engaging and interesting can it be?? Well!
There's no shortage of murdering and naked teenagers, and really almost no softening of the Myers character, but there is a definite appreciation of emotion throughout the playout of the story that seems to give it the depth and intelligence that the original lacked for me. That appreciation of finer emotion and deceptive use of sympathy actually winds up suckering you into a constant one-two punch at every next step Michael takes. It seems like this time is going to be different... ooh, Michael Myers is cool with so-and-so... then Blam! Noooo!!
Definitely worth seeing, though original Halloween fans would probably find it too 'complex' and high-brow in its filmmaking. I just liked it, though, since I could watch it while remaining intelligent.

3178606,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's ambitious retelling of the Carpenter classic met with negative to mixed results. In my opinion, he may have bit off more than he can chew. I admire his passion for the genre and the film has its merits but overall, the film is inferior to the original.

Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" is iconic and remains a classic. It is one of my favorite films of all time and I constantly re-watch it because I love it. The film does not rely on excess, over-the-top violence and gore to get its point across. The gore is minimal yet it overflows with tension, fear, suspense and mystery which elevates this rather simple tale to great cinematic heights. Even Roger Ebert (RIP) compared it to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Furthermore, Carpenter didn't really explain much. He simply gave us some spine-tingling images starting off with a chilling scene of a boy brutally killing his sister on a sinister Halloween night and culminating with that image of an empty yard where moments prior, Michael Myers lay dead from a gunshot wound to the head and 5 to the chest. We are left with questions. Why did this little boy kill his sister? Why did he return to Haddonfield 15 years later? Why does he stalk a shy high school student and her obnoxious friends? Why does he want to kill her? But .....do we really need to know this? Not really. Carpenter didn't even attempt to let us in on the mind of Michael Myers. Let us make up our own minds on why this evil exists. This is where I think Zombie tried too hard. The entire first half of his film is dedicated in showing us why Michael Myers became Michael Myers. In vain, he tried to give a face-less, murderous monster a soul. In doing so, he stripped away the mystery, the mythology. Also, in telling his tale he squeezed in as many unpleasant stereotypes as possible. In Zombie's version, Michael (played by Daeg Faerch as a child) was a dysfunctional, un-kept, disturbed social misfit. His mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and didn't really have the means to emotionally support her dysfunctional offspring. Her abusive, drunk boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe), who is obviously a negative influence lives with them as does Myers' egotistical, selfish, sex-crazed sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall) and let's not forget the school bully. Yuppers, I guess with so much wrong in this kids surroundings, it is understandable why he tortures small animals and is destined to become a mass murderer. In my opinion, it does not work. I do not think that there is enough time here to fully explain how a mentally sick child can turn into such an incredible, invincible mass killing machine. Zombie may have been successful in showing us how the young Myers could have become a Ted Bundy or a ""Jack the Ripper"" type killer... but never Michael Myers. Anyhow, due to neglect, emotional abuse, and mental problems, the young Myers snaps and commits some grisly murders on Halloween night. After a lengthy trial, he is found guilty of first degree murder and committed to the Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium where he is looked over by psychologist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and is visited frequently by his mother. It is within the walls of the Sanitarium that Myers begins another mental decent into madness. He becomes obsessed with making sinister papier-mch&eacute; masks. Dr. Loomis and Deborah try in vain to reach through to him but the boy just zones out and become more withdrawn until he is just an empty shell and when least suspected, commits another bloody act that proved to all the boy is a murderous psychopath. The story then jumps ahead several years. Michael (now portrayed by Tyler Mane), still withdrawn, unkempt, and massive (the guy looks to be at least 7 feet tall) escapes and returns to Haddonfield where he begins stalking the unsuspecting Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends. The rest of the film, despite some differences, is similar to the original film and follows the typical slasher formula. Lots of grisly executions, nudity and lots and lots of screaming.

As already stated, I just could not believe the chubby, androgynous, awkward blonde kid from the first part of the film became the 7 foot, invincible, hulking monster of the second half. It was not believable to me. I do appreciate that Zombie tried to take the tale in another direction and I did not expect him to give us a total rehash of the original film. Had he done so, he would have been criticized for not being original. In a tale like ""Halloween"", less is more and Zombie simply put, gave us too much. The atmosphere is also lacking. The ominous dark tones of the original was shoved to the side to make room for some trashy, unlikeable, uninteresting characters and lots and lots of vulgarity. This does not mean the film has no merits. As a slasher film, it delivers and this version out-does the original in sheer brutality. This Michael remains a spectacular villain. His size overwhelms and his grisly executions leave us no doubt he has a bone to pick with humanity. There are also some unsettling images such as those scenes that show a voiceless, withdrawn child in a psychiatric ward wearing sinister papier mch&eacute; masks. I just wished the rest of the film was this effective. Watch it for the gore, the spills, and for some of the performances (Malcolm McDowell, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingly effective here). Try not to compare it to the original. The magic that made that film so good is unfortunately missing here.

This version is the Unrated Director's Cut and is loaded with extras - Commentary, deleted scenes, bloopers etc that should please hard-core fans of the film and its director.",1399593600,2,5697,4.79938900203666

3178615,5,B000VKL6Z2,"When you decide to fool around with a film as beloved as John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic 'Halloween', you'd better be prepared for a backlash, whether you did the original justice or not. One look at the reviews here on Amazon is proof; nearly equal amounts of 1 star and 5 star ratings. But the truth is that Zombie, for all of his artistic imperfections, did indeed do Carpenter justice with his riveting remake. And that's a rarity in itself, with the more recent reworking of 'Evil Dead' being the only other modern horror remake worthy of acclaim.
  Where Carpenter succeeded with a sparse, quiet quality to create chills, Zombie knows no such restraints. He encourages histrionics from his actors, which works when blessed with a strong cast (see 'The Devil's Rejects', still his strongest work). In 'Halloween's case, a bit less could have been more, but overall the performances are gritty and appropriate to the subject matter. Of course, the primary question is: Is it scary? Oh, yes. Much like Carpenter, Zombie understands that the mood you create is crucial. Zombie's 'Halloween' will leave you shaken and unsettled.",1399075200,,1134,4.994708994708994

3178618,1,B000VKL6Z2,"So many things that made the original Halloween an instant classic was the ""why"" behind Michael Myers. I remember watching the original as a child and being scared out of my mind, not by the gruesome acts but by the ""why was he doing it?"" When his parents came upon him after he killed his older sister, he was silent, his eyes were dead, he stood there without an ounce of remorse, THAT is scary. THAT is what aids in the suspense of a true classic.

This movie... failed in so many ways, I couldn't even watch the whole thing. The Michael character was just pointless. There are a ton of people who come from lives like that who do not turn killer. Rob Zombie wants to say that a dysfunctional childhood creates killers? This Michael Myers was not scary, he was an emo waste.

People have commented that they like it because it explains his childhood from the original, where he went bad, (A) that's not enough to make a movie worth watching, and (B) in the original his childhood doesn't matter, the kid/murderer/psycho was simply born with no soul, which by the way makes him even spookier. Trying to relate this to the original doesn't even make any sense as in the original Michael wasn't born into a white trash, low class family with mom stripping and a pole dancer and his dad wasn't a lazy, non-working, alcoholic child abuser. The original Halloween was a classic, they should never try to remake a classic, especially if they're going to go so low budget. I said that this took 30 minutes of my time, well that's actually not true, I fell asleep pretty shortly after it started. That should tell you something. Not to mention how dark all of the scenes are, that put a decent strain on my eyes. This is nothing like the original, just a bunch of gore so if that's what you're into then go ahead and watch it. Me? I prefer to actually be scared when watching a 'scary' movie, not bored to tears. I cannot in any good faith recommend this movie. Stick to the original.

3178625,2,B000VKL6Z2,"So I liked the backstory. I really did. Yeah, it's cliched, and a little unbelievable, but I liked it all the same. Kudos to the actor who played young Michael Myers, he does a great sweet-and-adorable as well as a creepy-as-heck kid.

The film started to lose me with the teenage girls. They didn't talk like any teenage girls I've ever heard; in fact, the dialogue was so poorly written it seemed satirical, which does not have a place in this movie. Every word out of their mouths was laughable and made me hate them more and more.

On that point, not a single one of the characters was likable, which I feel is a huge drawback for a horror movie. The audience needs to be rooting for somebody but honestly, but the end I just wanted Mr. Myers to shut everyone up. Even Laurie, dear Laurie, was obnoxious and rude and there was really no reason to feel sorry for her or want her to live.

Last up, the sex. More specifically, the rape. There was a rape scene in this movie that was wholly, utterly, completely unnecessary. It did nothing to advance the story line and only made me uncomfortable watching it. It's really not good when the most uncomfortable part of a horror movie is rape that didn't need to be there in the first place.

Thanks for trying. It had potential, but it got lost somewhere along the way and ended up something I only barely don't regret watching.",1398297600,,1377,4.430830039525691

3178627,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie seems to love mixing white trash with the morbid. This movie is no exception. Though that is the case, I do feel like this movie did a much better job explaining some of the motivations behind Michael Myers. It also did a great job of building anticipation that preceded Micheal's return to his hometown.

What I really appreciated (other than being creeped out by the movie) was how Rob honored the first movie. There were many ties to the first film and it seemed to choose honoring the first movie over Rob's own twisted aspirations. Some of the shot sequences of the girls walking down the sidewalk with Michael in the background, along with the music from the first movie were used beautifully.

I'm not a huge fan of horror films, but I appreciated this one.",1398211200,,775,4.608695652173913
3178628,4,B000VKL6Z2,"It is definitely worth a view if you have a place in your heart for classic 70's and 80's horror. I grew up watching the Saturday Creature Feature and the Midnight Madness on my local UHF station. This brand and style of horror had narrative and characters you actually rooted for. This was the golden age of horror before CGI and torture porn took the style and substance away from horror movies. Michael Myers will always be a true legend in the horror cannon of my youth. I appreciated what Rob Zombie did with the film staying close to the source material but tweeking some of the vision of the film. Watch it for the glimpse into the childhood of Michael Myers and the relationship that was developed between he and Dr. Loomis during Michael's time in the mental institution. Malcom McDowell is great as Dr. Loomis and truly channels his inner Donald Pleasence. I was always curious about this relationship in the original Halloween. The second half of the film is the traditional teens having sex while being stalked and slaughtered by the unstoppable maniac. Tyler Mane does a great job acting out the mannerisms of a silent but insane killer. Kudos to Daeg French who played the young Michael Myers. His sweet youthful innocence is nicely balanced with the underlying force of brutality that lurks beneath the surface. I also appreciate all of the winks and nods to the classic Halloween, Mr. Sandman and Don't Fear the Reaper anyone? Also keep your eyes open for the cameos of the great horror actors we grew up with. Though they have bit parts, it is great to see them on screen again, especially Joe Grizzly. This is definitely the the better of the two Rob Zombie Halloween films as the second film focuses to much time on the supposed psychological mechanisms that drives Michael Myers. While I love Rob's wife as a b movie diva, there is a limit to how many scenes one can tolerate of her in a wind blown gown urging her son to reunite the family. So enjoy this film for what it is, a modern interpretation of a true classic. Afterall, there are so many Saw and Paranormal Activity movies one can tolerate.",1398038400,,2120,4.611111111111111

3178660,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I once sat in on a theatrical showing of this remake while I was waiting for my intended feature to start, I remember being revolted then, and nothing had changed by the time I tried watching it again. Zombie just is not a good director. His films lack story interest and anything close to a sympathetic character. I myself am not a drunk, a pervert, a stripper or exotic dancer, and I'm not a drug addict or a rapist or a serial murderer. So maybe that's why I have no empathy for any of his characters. They all seem like they were intended as mere psycho-fodder, so where's the drama? The Michael Meyers character especially is neither menacing nor sympathetic. He's just an ugly moon-faced brat who needs 2 in the brainpan. His family and victims all feel like they were destined to be killed in some grisly way that matches their dissolute existence. So where's the story? Who cares?",1396396800,3,888,4.55625

3178672,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Disgrace of a reimagining.  Rob Zombie loves the over the top white trash characters.  While that is not my style, it clearly is his style, and that's fine.  The problem is that it is not effective in the story that is being told.  Michael Myers in the original series was scary because there was no understanding of why he was so ""evil"".  Zombie's masked killer is a product of an epically dysfunctional family/upbringing.  In the classic debate of nature vs nurture he is a classic case of nurture.  Thus students in an intro to psychology class could explain his maniacal behavior.  Michael Myers is not supposed to be a grown up, damaged psychopath.  Michael Myers is the very personification of evil.  There is no obvious cause, he is simply evil.  Zombie's Michael Myers is not so much evil as he is in need of psychological therapy and some powerful medication.",1395878400,12,868,4.72

3178674,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This new version of the old favorite by Rob Zombie is actually very good.  A little bit more brutal than the original and full of cursive language (they use the F word a lot) it is sometimes harder to watch.  But a lot of the original scenes are recreated with different actors and actresses so it sometimes looks like the original.  The cinematography is better and the direction is pretty intense... I like the new Dr. Loomis and the kid who plays Michael.  Michael really turns into something horrible and is sometimes hard to look at.  Fast paced, brutal, bloody and intense, it might be scarier than the first although it was the newness of the first that gave it real shock value and that, I admit, is missing here.  We are all too used to being shocked I suppose.  I would suggest this movie for anyone who likes horror movies.  It is a good remake.",1395878400,,856,4.4423076923076925

3178677,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Like most of Rob Zombie's films, Halloween is gritty and filled with a dark realism that captures audiences by giving them a glimpse at the black depths of human nature.  The failing in this movie comes from Rob Zombie's attempt to bring that realism to the character of Michael Myers by making him nothing more than a disturbed child that becomes a ruthless killing machine.  This movie makes Michael Myers, originally portrayed and the epitome of evil, as nothing more than a sad product of his environment.  This detracted from the main story for myself, as it is not in line with the original movie, but Rob Zombie makes up for this with the intensity of the movie.",1395705600,,669,4.6525423728813555

As an audience member it was very good to know more about Michael Myers' family history...how he became evil incarnate, and how he drops further into madness.  Most remakes of 1980's horror flicks are not good.  I am happy to report that this remake, along with the recent release of the new Carrie movie, are worth watching!",1395619200,,500,4.767441860465116
3178681,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I am a horror movie junkie. My all time favorite horror movies were the original Halloweens. John Carpenter was and is a cinematic genius. When I heard that a remake of the original Halloween I was excited and skeptical. I was excited since Halloween would be coming alive again, I was skeptical since I didn't know how anyone could possibly come close to creating a piece even in the same league as the original. In a addition I was curious as to why it was even needed to be attempted to the first. Although, I was going in with a low bar of hope, I still wanted to see how it was due to the fact that I loved horror movies and am quite the analyst.
I have to say, I hated this film. There was nothing about it that I enjoyed. I barely felt the unknown or suspense that I had felt with the original. The movie added unnecessary elements, such as some of his history. The fact that we didn't know a lot of his history in the original made him a scary figure since it seemed like he was just killing to kill. They also made him quite large, which took out the scary element as well. Yes, the original Michael Meyers was tall but he was still an apparent human man. And the fact that he was just like any other man's size was scary since he could be so evil at the same time. They also added a rape scene in this movie. Totally unnecessary and extremely distasteful. Added nothing to the story. If you are going to add in extra scenes to make it your own, it should strengthen the movie not make it worse. Overall, I felt like there was too much gore. The pure scare of the original was the suspense and not seeing exactly what was occurring when Michael was always killing. It gave the audience the chance to imagine what terrifying things he did. I didn't get the same eeriness of camera angles, the characters seemed out of sync, Laurie Strode was increasingly annoying and stupid, Dr. Loomis was quite the cocky jerk as well and never seemed helpful or like the guardian that he was appointed in the original. I just thought it was a mess and was an awful experience. I felt like Rob Zombie took a classic and just decided to add a lot of gore and extreme death scenes, but really not adding a real feel of true scary. Anyone can have a man stab violently with a lot of blood, which is what he did. He doesn't seem to know the know the true essence of terror or how to portray evil. In this case, the remake of Halloween does not even begin to compare to original.

Side note, sometimes remakes can actually take over the reputation of the original which is devastating in this case since a lot of young people hadn't seen the original and went and saw this instead and didn't have anything to compare it to, thinking that this was ""awesome"". Halloween, 1978, was an amazing classic and will forever stand as being not only significant in the horror genre but in cinematic history.",1395532800,3,2884,4.311233885819521

3178683,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Not too bad at all.  Like many I grew up on the original Halloween and went with this out of nostalgia.

My rating is within the context of this genre of movie, which I rarely watch .  I thought some of the dialogue and non-action acting was on the weak side, but acceptable.  Good story line, good horror suspense.  I'll check out another Rob Zombie production after watching this...that is the next time I'm in the mood for horror.

3178684,3,B000VKL6Z2,"The good part was for a stand alone new version it was fine for the new fans. As for being a remake I can't understand where everyone acts like Rob used such a fresh angle. This was far from a fresh angle. It was the same pathetic attempt at pandering to a dumbed down society with the cliche dysfunctional family that drove the boy to kill. WRONG!!! Did Rob even watch the original movie in the first place. It wasn't a very long scene. Also Dr. Loomis mentions the fact a few times through some of the movies that the Michael had no reason to do the killing and that was what fascinated Loomis to the case. However it was explained that Michael's middle class NORMAL family from a NORMAL middle class neighborhood comes home that night from a Halloween party and as everyone slept he slaughtered his family without rhyme or reason with NO MOTIVE! Which made his character alot more vicious and scary then this version. All this Mike was just an abused Jeffrey Dahmer animal killing wannabe from a bad home. Where mommy was a stripper, sissy was a whore, and step daddy an abusive prick. I wish Rob had just stuck to his original 1000 Corpses family and not killed them off. This version is disappointing but still enjoyable enough to watch.",1395446400,,1242,4.5

3178686,5,B000VKL6Z2,This movie ( in my opinion ) was way better than John Carpenters version.....It's like Rob Zombie filled in the missing pieces to the original movie.,1393718400,,149,4.769230769230769
3178687,5,B000VKL6Z2,"FIrst of all, as a remake this movie does have some problems but as just another movie it's pretty darn good. The biggest changes actually didn't bother me as I enjoyed seeing Michael's backstory and actually felt for him in this movie, along with most characters. The overall tone of the movie was a refreshing change from the moderatly dark tones of the previous 5 films. Also a good plus was the violence aspect, and unlike the Friday the 13th movies this film got it right in that, I felt for the characters when they died in gruesome ways.

I should mention that in this movie past characters are portrayed differently from their counterparts. Loomis is a lot more action in this movie, Laurie's friends feel like they are less helpless (albeit just as stupid) and Laurie herself was more interesting to watch as this time, you don't know if she'll make it.

Now this movie does have a good amount of problems. People of course won't enjoy the characters acting differently, the problem with every movie, in that Michael is never noticed. Finally the biggest issue of, this movie has way to much bad language. Now usually I'm not annoyed by bad language, I'm a big fan of Pulp Fiction and Hell's Kitchen, but in this movie it was off the charts. Most annoying is the Laurie's first scene has her simulating a sexual act. Movie's can have the first showing of the protagonist doing stuff like that, but here it didn't work. I had a somewhat hard time feeling for Laurie given that first scene.

All in all, it was good for me, but won't be good for many others.",1393545600,,1565,4.542553191489362

3178691,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I have always been a huge Halloween fan. Halloween was one of the first horror movies I watched growing up. The original movie is a classic in every way. Everything about the original (acting, music, plot) is spot on.

Now I was feeling mixed emotions when I heard Halloween was going to be remade. Most likely because it's rare to find a decent remake to a movie. I kind of gave up hope on remakes especially after watching The Fog remake. That movie sucked on all levels! But I wanted to give this remake a chance especially as I am huge Halloween fan.

After watching the first half of the movie, I will give Rob Zombie credit where it's due. He came from a different angle. He focused the first half of the movie on Michael's childhood. There was way to much talking. So much talking - I was falling asleep!

Then it started to pick up after Michael is about to escape the hospital. What I was incredibly sickened by was having a rape scene in the movie. What the hell was Rob thinking putting a scene like that in this movie? Thank heavens, the forward skip button on the remote control exists.

When we meet the characters, I was quite shocked by the amount of sexual references each character makes. I mean each character was incredibly boring. The actress playing Laurie Strode was constantly screaming. Giving me a complete headache. Even the actor played Dr Loomis was boring. The violence in this movie was incredibly horrible. Way to strong!

I know with your average horror movie, you'll get the nudity, sex scenes and gore. But this movie was almost filled with too much of it. The only good thing about this movie was the music but that couldn't save it.

So if you enjoy a horror movie with a lot of sex and violence. Then this is the movie for you!

But if you enjoy your average horror movie, stick with the original.

Zombie takes this film and attempts to make it his own and it is hard to take this film seriously especially after being such a huge fan of the original. (BTW his wife is in this one as well).

3178704,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I like Rob Zombie. Met him a couple times and seems like a humble, normal person. I am not sure what all went wrong here. I think it is a tale of studios, trying new things, and a script that just wasn't very good. The killing in this film turns into weirdness at some point. At that time you also start picking apart the script. And then the house of cards starts falling down. The whole premise just has an aura of amateurish killing delight that the reality of it becomes more stupid the more you watch.

We all know America and beyond is messed up and produces the worst of the worst. But when you give life to these stories you need to make them real. Part of the problem here is that everything just starts becoming a carnival and this isn't Devil's Rejects. That was a great film. Really, it was. This one isn't even half that film. Someday I guess I am supposed to watch a director's cut. Well, I almost walked out of the theater for this film it was so bad. So.... idk about that. But I think now that he is back to making his own films the quality has gotten much better again.

The source material for this isn't exactly the greatest stuff in the world as far as realism or script goes. Well, imo, this film needed a healthy dose of realism to go along with its insane kill scenes. And it just doesn't have it here. Loomis and the like are just imbecilic in their roles and the way these guys go about trying to stop the killer is just absurd at this point. I couldn't get into this and believe a single moment even for a second and that is never good with horror in my opinion. I like subtle horror. If you are going to make a maniac and make him brutal then do it right. When you make this guy stupid, monster-like, and damn near sci-fi I just lose everything here I needed to like the film.

It becomes a circus and one that is deplorable, violent, and empty inside. If this film was more subtle, had less kills scenes but made them matter with more realistic dialogue in the social scenes I might have cared. As is half-way through you just start realizing you are watching kill scene after kill scene with no real point.",1385856000,8,2136,4.230392156862745

3178706,2,B000VKL6Z2,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic...

Halloween (2007) is a remake (yes, a REMAKE) of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), a classic of the horror genre.  Rob Zombie decided he wanted to remake Carpenter's classic and he turned it into an all-out gore fest that leaves nothing to the imagination.  We see lots of brutal killings, lots of nudity, and worst of all, Zombie gives a back story on Michael Myers which explains why he ended up being a killing machine.  I thought Michael Myers is the boogeyman.  The boogeyman shouldn't have a back story.  There shouldn't be any explanation of why Myers ends up a mass murderer.  When an explanation is given, it makes the viewer think, ""Well, this guy is just a typical serial killer, nothing unique about him.""  It totally destroys any mystery about the boogeyman/Michael Myers.  In the original movie, Myers was a guy with a playful side and we didn't know too much about him, other than that he escaped from a mental institution.

This movie doesn't do it for me.  The only decent thing about this movie is the autumn/Halloween atmosphere, which is a big improvement over the original, but that's it.  I added one star because of this.

There shouldn't have ever been a remake done.

I like it more every time I see it, much like the original film, which I still think is superior, but that is not to say that this film does not have it's merits.  It is a great film in its own right.  If the Carpenter film is about the evil that is unknown that is out there in the world, then Zombie's film is trying to make us look very hard into the idea of myth and history and what is really there.  Many people have seen this film as a biopic or trying to be to analytical of the original film, but I have to say that Zombie is trying to construct the mid american mysticism.  Most people in this country believe in ghosts.  It is because of religion and pop culture that we believe in things that allow us to look at a child murderer that is cute as a button and say, well, he must be possessed by a demon or a celtic deity.  The reality is that he probably came from an abusive home that is pretty typical in American life.  The film does not pick a particular period to be placed, but feels generally nostalgic of a memory of what American is supposed to be.

I know a lot of reviewers have commented on the cursing.  There is no character development they say.  I am not so sure that kids that age have fully developed anything.  I remember my friends getting together and just cursing and telling dirty jokes because it masked our insecurity.  The articulate teen is the inner dialogue that we remember thinking in those situation that becomes the memory of what happened.  This film goes directly into the face of the memory of the America that was and deconstructs it and terrorizes it.

I thought I should also comment on the director's cut vs. the theatrical cut.  Unlike many special editions, there is very little difference between the two films.  Some people have commented that the theatrical version is much better paced, while I myself prefer the director's cut in terms of message, but I can definitely see why people would prefer the other as it does flow better.  It is a shame that with all the different editions that have come out, that they haven't offered both versions of the film at the same time, but if I was only going to ever own one, I would go with the director's cut.  The reason that I have the theatrical cut on DVD as opposed to Blu Ray, which is the director's cut is on, is because if I am on the go, my DVD is more accessible.  The biggest difference being the escape sequence where Michael takes on several guards.  Another big difference is that Dr. Loomis dies in the theatrical version.  All this seems to focus on Michael as this unstoppable monster, where the slower pace of the director's cut focuses more on Michael as the victim.  It is a little slower and more methodical.",1378598400,3,2757,4.341796875

3178741,4,B000VKL6Z2,"*WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers*

As every horror movie fan is aware, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a classic, this is Rob's vision & not a total remake, so it's quite different than the original, hence the ""reimagining"" part.

The Movie: Overall, it's similar to the original & yet it's very different. Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is significantly darker, gory & has way more profanity, no big surprise there if you've seen Zombie's other films. There is more of a back story with Michael Myers, I understand some fans liked that whereas other fans of the original didn't, many preferred the mystery with Michael Myers. I personally preferred the actors performances in the 1978 version, but again, that's just my opinion. I found that in some scenes the girls were rather irritating to watch when they interacted with one-another & were over-acting at times to ensure that the audience knew they were close. Scout Taylor-Compton did a decent job, I'd never seen her in anything prior to this, I know that when the film was announced she got some flack for portraying Laurie Strode, mainly because she was famously played originally by Scream-Queen, Jamie Lee Curtis & it was a tough role to beat. One of the biggest differences I noticed in this from the original is that it's no secret, to the audience, that Laurie Strode (aka, Boo) is Michael myers' little sister; John Carpenter didn't release that information to fans until ""Halloween 2"".

The BluRay: Works well, no issues with playing it. If I'm not mistaken, there are quite a few special features, I haven't watched it in a while, but from what I remember they were pretty decent.

Overall: I recommend giving it a watch. You can't say you're a true Halloween fan unless you've seen the entire series!",1370476800,3,1769,4.886666666666667
3178742,5,B000VKL6Z2,"for the most part i find that remakes just aren't as good as the originals, but in this case i'm proven wrong. love what was done with it.",1369008000,,138,3.9642857142857144
3178743,5,B000VKL6Z2,"All you haters should just shut up or make your own movie and prove that you can make something better.  I thought the white-trash element at the beginning of the movie showing Michael's upbringing was perfect.  It was simultaneously gritty and funny in a way that few directors would have been able to pull off.  And it was exactly what was needed to bring the viewer into the movie and show us SOME of what contributed to the monster Michael became.  I emphasize ""some"" because I've seen reviews where it is claimed that Mike Myers is supposed to be just pure evil and was born that way.  Well what's to say that that isn't the case?  He just had some extra grief in the form of abusive step-dad, abusive sister, abusive schoolmates to contribute to his psychopathy.  He started off killing animals and being obsessed with dead animals.  That isn't something that just occurs because of poor upbringing.  Jeffrey Dahmer had a fine upbringing and look what he turned into.

People complained about bad acting.  I thought the acting was just fine, even from the young girls.  It had good music, as all Rob Zombie films do.  I saw nothing wrong with Malcolm McDowall's lines as some people have complained about.  Sheri Moon's acting was top-notch.  She has become one of my favorite actresses for being able to take on harsh roles while still being able to act sweet at the same time.  As someone who I think has been thrust into movies and didn't aspire to become an actress, she has done well.  She has progressed in her acting ability since The Devil's Rejects.

It saddens me to see all the negative reviews from people who just can't get over the fact that Rob made something original and didn't just remake the exact same movie.  Maybe this is why I saw Rob say in an interview that he is done making horror movies.  Rob, I hope you reconsider, because the horror movie world needs you.

And as a disclaimer, I'm not a fan of Rob Zombie's music, despite the fact that I love metal.  His directing and screenwriting on the other hand, is sheer brilliance.",1367712000,3,2060,4.5710382513661205
3178744,4,B000VKL6Z2,"John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is one of the best horror films ever made, a true classic in every sense. It had the formula to which every other horror film after would use time and time again. It also introduced the world to one of the most terrifying forces of evil to ever grace the silver screen: Michael Myers. For me, the idea of someone remaking a classic horror like this is outrageous. The original ultimately proves best. Which is why I have given this four stars instead of five. But only for that reason and that reason alone.

Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is a complete re-imagining of the Michael Myers legend. We see Michael's home life post killing his eldest sister, as a troubled young boy obsessed with killing small animals and being picked on by bullies. His violent nature is already pre-determined in the first five minutes of the film which begs the question that Mr. Zombie places before us: Nature vs. Nurture. I'd like to think Michael was an ignored child but ultimately he was born evil. His mother tries hard to be there for her son, but with working nights as a stripper and making ends meet without the help of her lazy lump of a boyfriend she simply doesn't have the time. Growing up in this sort of environment you can't help but feel sorry for Michael in some aspects, but not everyone who comes from a dysfunctional or abusive home turns into a vicious killing machine. After Michael murders his mother's boyfriend, his eldest sister, and her boyfriend he is arrested and sent to a Mental Facility under the guidance of Dr. Sam Loomis. After years of analysing and trying to get through to Michael, 20 or so years pass and Loomis eventually gives up. Then of course Michael escapes and returns to his hometown and the rest is history.

I can see perfectly clear where Rob Zombie was trying to go with this and I appalled him that he has in some ways pulled it off. I myself had my doubts, especially after seeing Rob Zombie's previous films HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. I think he knew that he had to treat this film with more respect considering the original's vast amount of fans who are just itching to troll him with negative comments about how he's ruined the series. No one can ruin the mark that the original film has left and in no way has this remake hurt it in any way shape or form. Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN isn't perfect, but it's better than most remakes Hollywood is chugging out.",1367366400,3,2437,4.548974943052392

3178747,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I am a Hardcore Halloween fan. I've seen all of them. This obviously pales in comparison to the original Halloween but we shouldn't compare. Scout Taylor Compton was awful in this. She was the biggest disappointment in the film. Malcom Mcdowell had the difficult task of trying to create a new Dr. Loomis after Donald Pleasence had cemented his place in history as one of the most beloved and greatest horror protagonist and hero. He was viewed as an honorable man here he is different. Dr. Loomis cares for Myers, wants to protect the teenagers from him but is also a little into himself trying to make money off his book. Danielle Harris was awesome in this. She gave stellar performances in Halloween 4 and 5 which made it feel nostalgic. A touch of the old with the new.
  Harris was great in the role of Annie and made up for Compton's atrocious performance. A nice touch is having most of the cast of The Devils Rejects make cameos in Halloween. It's nice to see Sid Haig, Bill Mosley and others in here. Brad Douriff is a great actor. He did good in this and played a bigger part than his character did in the original version. His character was the most likable in the film. Daeg Faerch did a great job in this. I thought he gave one of the best performances in the movie as a young Myers. He looked the part and did a great acting job. Sherri Moon Zombie did pretty good in this one as Myers mother. I found her to be likable and her acting was not bad in this film.
  The first half of this movie seems to be all Rob's vision and then the second back to the original story. I think overall hardcore fans of the series will enjoy this film. I think Rob Zombie fans will like it. I think you have to try to be fair to it. No one is going to equal what Carpenter did but this movie is still fun. I think some people may not have liked the different take on Dr. Loomis character I think there will only be one Dr. Loomis but it was good they took his character in another direction instead of a carbon copy of Pleasence. So my two favorite things about this movie was Malcom Mcdowell and Danielle Harris. We had a quality actor playing Loomis and a actress who was a big part of the original franchise. I recommend this movie to all horror fans. Cheers!",1364601600,3,2259,4.271028037383178
3178748,5,B000VKL6Z2,Rob zombies remake was very cool yeah never better than the original but it was an awesome movie. He brings you in side of Michael Myers and shows why he went mad and was unstoppable. Great idea and writing...,1363046400,,209,4.384615384615385

3178750,4,B000VKL6Z2,"There generally are two camps for this movie. People who hate it and think it should never have been made and people who love it. I am actually somewhat in between. Although I do lean toward liking it, it is not as good as the original. There is a definite effort here to establish a back story for Michael and to try to explain why he turned out the way he did. Whether it works or falls flat is pretty much a matter of subjectivity. Part of what made the character scary is that there was no explanation in the first one for why he killed his sister in the beginning. In this one you get the impression that he kills her because she is mean to him and does not take him Trick or Treating on Halloween. He also kills the sister's boyfriend and alcoholic step dad. I do however like how they showed how the mom reacted to everything. I also liked how they developed the Loomis Meyers relationship over time.

Once the 15 year time jump happens the film stays closer to the original, but is not a shot for shot remake. While some of the scenes and lines from the original are recreated, it is ultimately a different movie. Some people like that and some hate that, but if you are expecting an exact remake of the original movie you will not get it.

The two things I did not like about the movie was how they kind of made Loomis into a publicity seeker (by having him write the book) and that only gets worse in the sequel to this. I also did not like the casting for the adult Michael. Tyler Mane is a 6'7"" ex pro wrestler. Part of what made Michael Myers scary in the first place was the fact that he was a normal size guy who could not be stopped. You take a 6'7"" guy who can throw people around like a rag doll and you automatically think unstoppable, and it is laughable when anyone tries to fight back. That may have been what they were going for, but when you have a guy that cannot be knocked down then you lose the dramatic effect of him getting back up.

I did like the casting otherwise. I thought Scout Taylor Compton did a good job as Laurie, although she was not the meek character that Jamie Lee Curtis played in the first film. However given that this was made three decades later, they really did have to update how the teenagers and even the younger kids acted to make it something that would appeal to the audience. I also liked how they gave Danielle Harris (the little girl from Halloween 4 and 5) a large role in this movie.

There is also a lot more gore in this one than the original. One of the hallmarks of the first movie is that there was very little blood. Given today's horror movie climate, and who was directing the movie, there was of course going to be a lot more blood and gore in this one. By now anyone who was likely to see this already has. But if you have not, then I would say if you are a fan of the series and do not have a how dare they mess with the original attitude, then check this out. If the though of a remake makes you wince then probably skip it.",1362787200,3,2998,4.146048109965636

I liked the new take on Michael Myers. Rob gave him a little more background and the physical presence to match the emotional rage the original character must have felt. I think the key to Rob Zombie evolving into one of the ""Horror Masters"" is going to be him learning to leave a slight bit to the imagination. I see him playing with this concept in this movie as compared to some of his others.",1358208000,,542,4.323529411764706

3178759,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Why remake a perfect film? Rob Zombie asked himself this same question when it came to making and directing this movie. There are several reasons why Michael Myers (also known as The Shape) endures as a horror icon. One reason is because John Carpenter's 1978 classic was the first film since Psycho (1960) to really create a memorable horror movie villain. Another reason might be that Halloween was such a well made film that it has become a benchmark of the horror genre. So why remake the movie? Your guess is as good as mine. It could be that we have been living in an age of big budget Hollywood remakes for about 10 years now. And who better than to make this production a reality than Rob Zombie who did 2 really solid horror flicks before this (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects).

The problem is that the 2007 Halloween remake, while it adheres to the basic story elements of the original, it takes Michael Myers and his supporting characters out of the comfort zone that Halloween fans were in and turns these beloved characters into shadows of their former selves.

Michael Myers becomes a product of abuse and a trailer trash upbringing and that is to serve as his motive for being a psychotic killer. The mystery that existed in the original film is removed. Laurie Strode starts out close to the original portrayal as offered by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, a shy wallflower, but by the end of the film she is little more than a rebellious, psychologically scarred teenager. Dr. Loomis is played as wholly different than in the original film as well... He is a much colder and stranger personality and less of a serious psychiatrist bent on helping or stopping his mad patient. The rest of the characters, Michael Myers family, and others seem very unbalanced as the film progresses as well and don't really seem to serve much purpose. His mother for example is a stripper, concerned more about her dancing at the beginning until her son kills and is put into an asylum. Then all of a sudden she becomes a caring and nurturing mother.

It is an entertaining reimagining and the scenes in the mental hospital were a nice touch, but ultimately it lacks what true fans of Halloween wanted, a suspenseful, holiday-centric, horror movie.",1356825600,,2261,4.690176322418136

All the characters are unrealistically despicable and the added kills to the beginning of the story take away from any actual shock that was intended to exist. It's also bogged down by needless socio-political commentary, goofy shot choices and a lack of understanding of the source material.

You weren't supposed to sympathize with the killer in the original film, you weren't supposed to know his intentions, BECAUSE HE'S NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER. The point of Michael Myers was to create a modern version of a movie monster, a dehumanized force of violence that didn't care about what it was doing. All this film does is make Michael Myers into a whiny brat who's given the worst psychotherapist in a world where all the characters are despicable a-holes.

As soon as I read news that a remake was in the works I was a little dissapointed at first because of the way ""Reurrection"" ended. But when I went to the theater to seen this one my mouth dropped. I was so pleased. I knowdist that Rob Zombie helmed it as well. Before I was a little nervious at first because I hated ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". But if it wasn't for it's sequel ""The Dvil's Rejects"" then I would have said ""no"" entirly to this one. From the moment this one started I knew I would like it. I loved how Zombie devided the story in three acts. The first is showing Michael's childhood and what made him snap. The second showed him in the mental hospital then the third when he breaks out and goes after his sister.

I thought it was a really good idea to get us familiar with the character of Michael Myers,before turning into a full-blown killer.

Malcolm McDowell, William Forsythe, Danielle Harris, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Clint Howard, Dee Wallace, Ken Foree, and Sid Haig.

With some great characterization from new comers Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Sheri Moon Zombie, Skyler Gisondo and Jenny Gregg Stewart (plays young Lindsay Wallace, who will blast your ears off with her freaking screams geez!).

This is brutal an raw if you want pg-13 horror look away, its got enough cuss words to rival Scarface and more than enough blood and gore to satisfy even Jeffrey Dahmer's eclectic tastes.

Like it or hate it is different, the basic structure is there but that's what made Halloween ""Halloween"" it'd be like Friday the 13th without the lake and counselors.

Watch a new spin on an old classic and take it for what it is; a homage, a re-imaging, and most of all a good time.",1350864000,,1032,4.807909604519774
3178779,4,B000VKL6Z2,"When Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" first came out, despite my initial reaction to anyone trying to remake Carpenter's classic, I went to see it in the theater. I hated it! Outside of the soundtrack, I thought there was little to no value in Zombie's film.

For lack of anything better to watch I decided to give the movie another shot. I have to say I was pleasently surprised. While I still hate the opening 5 - 10 minutes or so (I think Zombie was a bit ham handed  and over the top in making sure the viewer knew Michael came from a dysfunctional family), the rest of the film was pretty gripping and interesting.

As the movie starts out, we are introduced to the Myers family. A family so dysfunctional they would have to go to therapy in order to move into a trailer park. Stripper Mom, Alcoholic and Abusive Step-Dad, Trampy older sister named Judy, Wierdo and bullied Michael and the baby Laurie. Some people didn't like that we got Michael's backstory, I was one of them initially, because it was bit creepier thinking that Mike came from a good home and just snapped like in the original. With Zombie's film we get to see what creates the hulking psychopath seen in the second half of the film. When Michael finally snaps and kills one of the bullies from his school, it starts the killing spree that will conclude on Halloween night 18 years later (or continues 18 years later once the sequel came out?).

Institutionalized because of the murders, Michael meets Dr. Loomis, a psychiatrist that initially tries to help Michael, but later exploits him and his crimes. Michael spends most of his life locked away in a small room, hiding and wearing masks of his own design until one Halloween night he decides to go home and find his little sister.

Very bloody, boob filled and violent as all get out, Zombie definately makes the story his own. Zombie's version of Michael Myers is similar to the classic portrayal of Jason Voorhees from the ""Friday the 13th"" films, an unstoppable hulking, silent killer. In the old ""Halloween"" films, Michael was the boogeyman that lurked and popped up out of the dark. If you go into this film hoping to see Michael lurking in the background, slowly sneaking up on his prey...you'll hate this movie. There is nothing subtle about the scare or Michael in this movie.

And while I don't think Zombie's version is nearly as good as Carpenter's classic, it's a good deal better than part's 4, 5, 6, & Resurrection. Zombie at least made Myers scary again.",1350604800,,2490,4.634920634920635

A terrifying portrait of what can be wrought on to others by a person whose years of systematic abuse by his family, & by those who ostracize him from society, filled with malicious school bullies, to a psychologist exploiting him for personal monetary gain & fame.

I like his music and was overwhelmed with joy after House of 1000 Corpses, just because it was a REAL horror film, when all we had were ignorant 'horror' films that just tried to trash horror altogether. When I first heard that Rob was going to do a Halloween movie, I jumped for joy. I heard he was supposed to be such a huge fan of the movie and I thought if anyone could bring it back to the brilliance of John Carpenter, Rob could do it.
  I WAS WRONG.
  I think Rob must've sat and watched John's movie and said, 'Everything he DID do, I WON'T do. Everything he DIDN'T do, I WILL do.'
  Not much blood, mine will be a bloodbath.
  Not a lot of nudity, mine will have wall-to-wall t&a.
People who never got the idea that Michael Myers was supposed to be the boogeyman and he's supposed to be a supernatural entity in the shape of a human will be happy, because Rob makes Michael a 'regular' guy, making the Loomis dialogue about him being evil sound really pretentious. Also, it's funny that you can keep shooting him and stuff and he still keeps coming, despite the fact he's a 'regular' guy. You can even blast his blood and brains all over the place and he'll just wind up with a little scrape on his head.
  Sorry Rob. Have to call B.S. on that.
  I'm really trying to say that Rob Zombie just WAY OVERTHOUGHT this movie. One of the things that made the original so great was the fact the story was so simple, if you just pay attention while watching it.
  I DO like the cast a bit. Danielle Harris and Kristine Bleebe are lovely, awesome and look really good with no clothes on. Malcolm McDowell was a super choice for Loomis. Brad Dourif is always a joy to see in any movie. We get the Zombie regulars (i.e. Sherry Moon, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Ken Foree, etc.) That warmed my heart to see that.
  I am waiting with anticipation to see Lords of Salem, his next movie, but Rob should stop with remakes and make his own, original movies. This flick shows that just because you can remake movies, doesn't mean you should.
  Plus, the original Halloween is a beautiful, well-shot movie. This looks more like Rob was making a dingy, unappealinjg exploitation movie. Good stuf, but John Carpenter still rules.",1345075200,6,2317,4.373831775700935

I don't know any other way to let people know how big a fan I am of these movies and you too. Hopefully you will read this someday and see how much I love you. That would be the biggest thrill of all. Love the great Sheri Moon Zombie and all the horror veterans in your Halloween movies. Make Halloween 3 please!!!

3178803,5,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, this is a great horror movie.  Forget whether or not it's a remake.  Almost every review compares this Halloween to the original, but the point isn't to say whether it's better or worse.  The point is that Rob Zombie wanted to tell the story his way.  May I also mention that John Carpenter gave Zombie his blessing to do so?  When I read the negative reviews here and saw so many people bashed it, I decided to watch it again, just to see if it deserved the criticism I was seeing.  What I noticed is that everyone keeps pointing out the same aspects, but what I can't understand is why (especially when most reviews start out with: ""I love horror movies, but..."").  I wanted to justify the reasons why Zombie's Halloween included the things many people disliked, namely:

-Michael's trashy family and they way they talked to each other.  I'm sorry, but some families are really like this.  It's sad, but it's true.  I've lived in apartments most of my adult life and have had the misfortune of living next to white trash neighbors on more than one occassion.  I've heard comments similar to those in this movie coming through the walls when my neighbors would start up with each other.  It may have been exaggerated a little in the movie, but that's not to say it isn't far from the truth for some people.  It's reality and it's unpleasant.

-Michael's family life isn't a sufficient enough reason for him to become a killer.  Who's to say?  I've never researched serial killers' backgrounds, but don't most cases reference some abuse or molestation as a child?  In the movie, Michael's getting it from all sides--his mother's boyfriend, his sister and bullies at school.  I assume either his genetic makeup predisposed him to violent behavior and it only took a small stimulus to trigger it, or years and years of verbal (and possibly physical) abuse was enough to make him snap.

-The actor who played the adult Michael was too big.  WHAT?!?  He HAS to be big, in order to fight off everyone he encounters.  Seriously, if he were average size, would he have been able to withstand the nightstick attacks from the guards at the mental ward?  What about the trucker or the teenage boys who fight back when Michael attacks them?  If Michael were 5'6"" and 150 lbs, the likelihood of someone stopping him would be too high.  The impact alone from the gunshots he sustained would have sent him reeling.  Most horror movies get slammed because the villain has almost superhuman abilities and keeps coming back again and again, but in this case you're saying you want the killer to be smaller and more vulnerable?  Making Michael a bigger guy supports his ability to take a hit and keep on coming.

*On a related note, one thing that impressed me at the end of this movie was Laurie shooting Michael in the head.  Perhaps the biggest cliche in any movie (not just horror films) is assuming the bad guy is dead without confirmation.  Laurie repeatedly pulling the trigger on the revolver until it fired was an excellent addition to the ending.

-Gratuitous female nudity.  Yes, there's a lot.  Why?  Well, just like in every horror movie, there are teenagers experimenting with sex.  Isn't that what Friday the 13th taught us and Scream reiterated?  Having sex in a movie will get you killed?  The difference here is that Zombie doesn't sugarcoat it just for the sake of keeping the MPAA off his back.  Right before Lynda dies, she thinks she's talking to the guy she just had sex with, so she doesn't bother to get dressed before getting up to grab the beer from his hand.  Why would she, given they had just been together moments earlier?  Her dead body is then shown naked throughout the rest of the movie because Michael doesn't care if she's clothed or not.
When Annie's attacked, she has to do what she can to save her life.  She doesn't have time to put on a shirt.  I think these are more realistic depictions of those situations than most horror movies portray.  Zombie wants to evoke empathy and a feeling of helplessness from the audience by showing the girls being attacked when they're at their most vulnerable. Those same scenes could have been shot from the neck up, but they would have lost their impact.  Some people have said all that nudity doesn't make this a good movie to watch with the family.  Huh???  I hope they're not talking about kids, and if they're talking about other adults, I would assume those adults could handle a little skin.  I'm a grown man and I would have no problem watching this movie with any of my friends, male or female, as long as they knew to expect a more graphic horror experience than what most scary movies provide.

-The guys all have long hair and the teen girls act too loose.  Again, I think too many people are focusing on the original, which is generally referred to as an '80s movie (even though it came out in 1978). The remake never says when it takes place.  The opening sequence only says ""October 31,"" not the year.  I assume Michael was a child in the '70s, when it was popular for guys to have long hair.  As for the girls acting slutty, I seem to remember a few girls from high school who had a reputation for being easy, too.  Just because the girls weren't angels and the guys had long hair, this was a bad movie?  Come on.

All in all, I think the people criticizing this movie are either paying too much attention to the name on the box or are somewhat naive to the real world.  This isn't a movie to screen at your church social or when you have your mother over for tea.  Zombie has created a brutally violent horror movie that is probably about as real as you can get and still keep theatrical distribution and an R rating.  It's his response to all the PG-13 ""horror"" movies that have been mass-produced in recent years just to give the latest batch of Hollywood up-and-comers acting jobs.  It's SUPPOSED to churn the stomachs of people with decent morals.  Some people may find it too over the top, but I think it turned out exactly as it should have, given what Zombie was likely trying to achieve.",1321920000,2,6086,4.543698252069917
3178804,1,B000VKL6Z2,"do not a classic make.
The first half of this film is tedious and boring and totally saps the life out of one of the greatest movie monsters of all time.
The point of the original film was that Michael Myers was evil incarnate.  By reducing him to a human serial killer Rob Zombie drives a stake through the heart of a legend, and shines a light on some of the deepest problems of our day: evil is banal, common, and totally human.
In the original film Michael was an ordinary 6 year old from a good family.  There was no human explanation for his actions on that fateful Halloween. paving the way for the acceptance that evil had taken up residence in his soul, breathing life into the boggy man.
I haven't even finished watching the new version yet, I know that it's going to be little more than a boring, bloody rehash of the original, so far the second half is just a scene for scene ripoff.  The only thing new and different is that the slut and her boyfriend are partying in the old Myers house.  Not enough to justify the waste of my time.  I'm glad that I only paid $3.99 to rent it.
I haven't seen anything approaching a sympathetic character yet.  This version's Lorie is just another dumb, vulgar bimbo who I will find it hard to root for.
And suspending disbelief to accept that this Michael is evil incarnate won't happen.
All the 5 star reviews for this film just further convinces me that imagination is dead in this society.  It's a sad fact that all it takes to keep modern movie audiences happy is gallons of fake blood poured all over the set.",1321660800,7,1562,4.347079037800687

If that doesn't demystify Carpenter's creation, everything that follows does.  Zombie has managed to do the unthinkable; he's turned an icon of horror into a sniveling creature of banality.  Then he populated his film with strange casting choices that came off as crazy inside jokes: Udo Kier and Clint Howard!

3178808,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie immediately sets about committing the worst mistake you can with a horror villain: He shows us way too much.

First we get a painfully long look at Myers childhood. His white trash parents, abusive step-father, bullies at school, etc. Myers snaps and kills a bully. Then on Halloween night he kills his step father, after strapping him down to a chair with duct tape. It beggars belief not just on a practical level, but the child playing Myers just does not seem all that disturbed. We are supposed to assume he is based on his actions, but it's not present in the performance. At all.

Then Myers is shipped off to the Mental Hospital where he meets Dr Loomis and then grows up. We are treated to many scenes letting us know what a bad ass Myers is now. Eventually Myers escapes and then a much less effective rehash of the original film is played out. None of it is the least bit scary.

That's the main problem here. It's obvious that Mr. Zombie sympathizes with the Myers character above all else. He has little love for Loomis or anyone else in this film (except Myers mother...paging Dr Freud...)

This is a love letter to fan boys of, not Halloween, but the Myers character. It's apparently societies fault that Myers goes berserk, and his victims are not so much victims, but deserving targets of Myers rage. It's something a disaffected 14 year old might come up with. The sort of sheltered poser that got all their ideas about what is ""gritty and real"" from, well, bad Halloween sequels.

I suppose none of this is too surprising, considering the cult following Myers has built up over the course of several sequels. It would have been nice to see the series dragged back to its original premise though, where Myers was not a hero and we were supposed to care about his victims.

Gone is most of the supernatural element of the original. We are firmly in fully human psycho territory here. How boring. Especially since Zombie has nothing to add, he just regurgitates all the well worn clich&eacute;s. Brain dead style over no substance.",1319932800,5,2058,4.624657534246575

3178814,1,B000VKL6Z2,"HALLOWEEN (2007)
Rated R / 109 minutes

Back in July of 2002, I sat in the local movie theater, stunned at the awfulness known as ""Halloween: Resurrection"". I couldn't fathom how someone could actually make such crap. After the film concluded, I vowed I would never see another ""Halloween"" in the theaters again. Well, fast forward to 2007 and lo and behold, I lied. In this era of filmmaking, the biggest hurtle and the worst flaw for many films is brought on by the very first step of the filmmaking process; the script. While viewing Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, ""Halloween,"" I can safely say that the film suffers the same fate.

It is no exaggeration to say that the film is filled with nothing more than half baked ideas, truly God-awful dialogue (that seriously could have been written by a rambunctious young teen) and one-dimensional characters. This new age ""Halloween"" is just filled with such mean-spirited and foul-mouthed language that it rarely sounds natural. This rings especially true during the sequences of Michael's ""white trash"" upbringing. However, you can hardly blame the poor acting performances (William Forsythe, for one) on anything other than the poor script. You can only work with what you got, and most of which is quite bad.

A major structural problem with Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the uneven three-part element to the film. Essentially, the film wants to suggest that Michael is a psychotic killer due to the abuse he's had to withstand and ultimately, Zombie tries to make Myers a sympathetic character. Consistently picked on by bullies and his mother's boyfriend, Michael eventually snaps. From some of the illogical and silly ""kill sequences"" that sets-up Michael's eventual path to the Institution to his over-the-top escape 15 years later, we learn nothing about Michael that couldn't have been stated in all of 3 minutes into the film. Basically, Myers has been reduced to a run-of-the-mill serial killer that is neither interesting nor scary. Though Zombie goes to great lengths to try and make the story resonate as being a disturbing piece of work, it often comes across as either unintentionally comical or painfully contrived. In fact, I must say the idea of the ""mood masks"" is a really bad one, and never works on screen. Tyler Mane (adult Michael Myers) looks absolutely ridiculous in them. And speaking of unintentionally funny moments; the film features the worse misuse of the classic tune ""Love Hurts"" you are ever likely to see. Furthermore, and even more troubling, Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) are no longer the lovable characters they once were. Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) is wasted and Laurie's teen friends Annie (the near 30-year-old, Danielle Harris) and Lynda (Kristina Klebe) are not only unlikeable, there's no real differences established between the two characters. In fact, nearly every character is underdeveloped and unlikable while every female character is either bitchy or slutty, but mostly both. Quite simply, Zombie's characters lack personality and individuality. They are interchangeable and often times, characters are introduced only to be dropped moments later.

After the clichd and tired way of Myers gaining his iconic mask to the killing of Joe Grizzley (Ken Foree), the 6'8 mask-wearing maniac roams the streets of Haddonfield nearly undetected. By this point of the film, it was decided to remake ""Halloween"" nearly scene for scene in rapid fire transition. Many flaws pop up during these sequences that simply defy explanation -- for one such example being; continuity. Apparently, Myers is able to be everywhere at once. From scene to scene, he is magically in a different place as if he's the genie from ""Aladdin"". Another major flaw is the fact that Zombie has assumed that everyone has already seen Carpenter's original (and even its sequel). I hope those audience members have or they will be deeply confused why Myers is all of a sudden stalking some teenage girls. It is never known previously that Laurie is his sister. In fact, the earliest part of the film refers to Laurie one time, and that is only by the nickname of ""Boo"".

It seems that the main idea was to remake ""Halloween"" into a film with a higher body count, more T & A and more gore with no regards to logic or continuity. The latter could quite possibly be tolerated, however, if the film was able to deliver any scares, suspense or even some creative kills. Instead we are lambasted with shaky-cam effects during some lame, repetitive kill sequences that can not be glossed over just by loud sound effects or by turning up the musical score. The key to making a good horror film both scary and suspenseful, you would first need characters that you can truly care about, and this film doesn't have any. If the idea was to be more of a ""complete film,"" Rob Zombie has certainly failed to deliver as he was unsure to be a prequel or a remake, and thus we are left with incoherent bits and pieces of both.

Overall, this ""Halloween"" is an unfocused mess. It's just insulting, deeply flawed (so much so I'd need twice the space to describe them all), and it entirely lacks any semblance of a cohesive unit, not to mention the severe lack of atmosphere and suspense. And while some scenes look sharp, the interaction between characters comes out as being forced and uninspired. Do yourself the favor of steering clear away from this drivel. Now, after all this, I know I can swear off future ""Halloween"" installments forever ... or so I say.",1317427200,9,5568,4.949732620320856
3178815,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie took and already awesome classic and made it better.

3178817,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Once upon a time, someone decided it would be a great idea to let Rob Zombie make a movie: the result was a piece of crap known as ""House of 1000 Corpses"". Oddly enough, someone gave him money again and he came up with an even worse piece of crap: ""The Devil's Rejects"". Though showing no real talent nor any real distinct vision, someone decided to give ol' Rob the reigns on a ""Halloween"" remake and he delivered... yet another piece of crap. Only this piece of crap is destined to be compared to a rather simple, yet effective modern horror classic and what many consider to be the springboard for the modern slasher film.

People will say it's unfair to compare this remake with the original film that inspired it, but then those are probably the same un-thinking clowns who thought this whole enterprise would be a good idea anyways. Look, it's a film called ""Halloween"" with a storyline that mirrors a previous film called ""Halloween"" - how do you not compare the two? More importantly, this remake is so inept that you really can't help but think of the original and what it did (or didn't do) more effectively. If you were doing a remake of a small foreign film that no one ever heard of, you could probably get away without much comparison, but when you remake a film this well-known, you're pretty much asking for it... and crying foul when people do so seems a little ridiculous on your part.

Side Note: that particular criticism never makes any sense because the basic argument is that you should be open-minded enough to accept a new interpretation on an old idea, but the argument really works both ways. If you tell someone the remake sucked and the original was better, they often counter with how the original sucked and the remake was better. Aren't the people who champion the remake just as guilty of being closed-minded as those who deride it? Talk about a pot/kettle moment.

With that being said, Zombie gives us almost an hour of unnecessary backstory before propelling us into the by-the-numbers slasher plot that most viewers are accustomed to. Here it is in a nutshell: Michael Myers is a pudgy demented kid who has an equally annoying family and is taunted by even more annoying bullies. One day he snaps because this is pre-Jerry Springer so he can't go on television to get it all out of his system. After an hour of this, it's more-or-less Carpenter's original film as Michael, now a human tank, hacks and slashes his way back to Haddonfield in order to do... um... something. Zombie's script combines elements of the original ""Halloween"" and elements from ""Halloween II"" and tries to make you more sympathetic to Michael's mental imbalance. There's a lot of psychological mumbo-jumbo that doesn't really go anywhere and there's lots of ambiguity concerning what Michael's ultimate goal really was.

In the meantime, you get plenty of bad acting, multiple amounts of T&A (sans Mrs. Zombie - sometimes it pays to be married to the director) and no real scares. To say it's all rather unnecessary is putting it mildly. The only real fun to be had is by hardcore horror buffs who can make a game out of spotting-the-C-list celebrity (is that Mickey Dolenz? Hey, Ken Foree! Oh, it's Dee Wallace!) This is the only cheap thrill that the film seems to muster and aside from some clever casting, the movie really doesn't have much going for it. Since it's clear that the main focus of this film is Michael Myers, all the other characters are largely ancillary. Scout Taylor-Compton proves she's totally incapable of playing a convincing teenager (hired because Zombie felt she ""wasn't too actor-y"" - truer words were never said), though it's not entirely her fault since Zombie feels more at home writing scenes that feature the worst of cussing white trash than scenes of actual believable people. Laurie's friends are largely forgettable, but it is fun to see Danielle Harris (particularly if you remember her from previous sequels to the original ""Halloween""). Here, she's mostly unnecessary and you sort of wish she was playing Laurie, though that would just send the fans of the original ""Halloween"" films into a mental geekgasm tailspin.

It's always fun to see Malcolm McDowell and Danny Trejo in nearly anything, but here they don't serve much purpose. Donald Pleasance may have only served the purpose to spout a lot of jargon about the nature of evil in the original films, but he chewed the scenery quite nicely and he's sorely missed here. Michael's nemesis, Sam Loomis, is largely underdeveloped here - so much so, that he's practically unnecessary, which is a shame because there's only so much you can do with a film centered around a walking slaughterhouse who's mute. Speaking of, there's Daeg Faerch, who plays young Michael Myers and he's horrible. Some people praised his performance, but I'm not sure they saw the same kid I did. He's unpleasant to look at (which you think would help when playing Michael Myers) and he's unconvincing. Apparently, he filmed scenes for Zombie's ""Halloween II"" but was cut because he was too tall, so they got another kid. This automatically makes ""Halloween II"" a better movie, but that's a whole other review all together.

Also, since this is a Rob Zombie film, Sherri Moon Zombie is in this and plays Michael's mother in the rather-lengthy backstory. Strangely, she's the only seemingly likable character in the whole film and seems to be the only character somewhat fleshed out (pun intended, cuz see... Michael's mother is a stripper in this film. However, paradoxically, Sherri seems to be one of the few female cast members who isn't nude in this film. Go figure.) The rest of the cast isn't of particular interest, so there's no real point in talking about them.

So, aside from some bad acting, what else makes the film seem so shoddy? Well, it's crystal clear that Zombie has an obvious affinity for late 70's horror films reminiscent of Wes Craven or Tobe Hooper, however, most horror fans won't admit that most of the horror films of that particular era just weren't very good, so it seems a somewhat odd choice of era to emulate with a film that's trying to appeal to today's youth. At any rate, there Zombie goes and succeeds in making us not like a single character on the screen. Quite a feat, really. Unfortunately, by doing this, we have no one to really sympathize with (sorry, I don't sympathize with Michael Myers either. Yeah, he had a bad childhood, but he seems just as likely to end up as Marilyn Manson as Michael Myers - the unstoppable killing machine.) With no one to sympathize with, it doesn't really matter what happens in the rest of the movie and, quite frankly, this film doesn't try really hard to generate any suspense. In that sense, I guess Zombie did succeed in emulating the likes of something like Wes Craven's original ""The Last House on the Left"": things just sort of happen and they film it, but it's not like you care about it too much.

There are also several other issues you seem to think about while watching this movie that cause you to not really care for it. For me, it was the following:

1.) What timeframe do the two halves of the movie take place in? The first half seems like the late 70's/early 80's, but the second half - supposedly taking place only 15 years later, has a clear post-2000 vibe.

2.) What is with the long hair? Nearly everyone in this film has annoying long hair (even Malcolm McDowell for quite awhile)... and it usually hangs in front of their face. WTF? This isn't scary, just annoying.

3.) If I have to watch one more horror film that features Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear The Reaper"", I will spend my own savings to buy the rights to that song just so I can not license it to anybody and I don't have to hear that song in another horror film ever again.

4.) How come Michael emphatically kills some people, but lets others live for no discernable reason? Zombie establishes earlier that Michael has no boundaries (seemingly, the reason why Danny Trejo is killed), but then he lets Danielle Harris survive and Sam Loomis is only incapacitated. Guess you can't kill fan favorites in case there's a sequel.

5.) What's Michael's plan? He kills one of Laurie's friends and places the Myers tombstone above her and then abducts Laurie and shoves a picture at her that she has no idea how to interpret. Is his plan to kill her or just resume being a family again? Sure, things are just as ambiguous in the original, but here, they went through all the effort to explain Michael, yet his motivations are still entirely unclear.

6.) In both this film and the original, how come kids (and teenagers) running down a suburban street yelling ""Help! Help!"" never elicit any response from any neighbors... ever?

7.) When Laurie called 911 to help her friend Annie (Danielle Harris), the cops show up at the house Laurie runs back to though she called to get to help at the house that Annie was in. Later, Loomis and the sherriff (as well as an ambulance) show up at the house Annie is in and seem to ignore the patrol car (with lights flashing) at the other residence that Laurie went back to. How does the emergency crew know to show up at different houses?

8.) That ""Trick or Treat"" title card... really? What was that for?

Maybe I'm too meticulous in my nitpicking, but with a boring movie, you tend to think of these things. All in all, there's nothing to recommend this movie and you're not missing much if you never see it. I would recommend picking up the original. Though it's definitely dated, it's far more effective and really utilizes the theme of the holiday (the original film used traditional Halloween lore and activities far more extensively thus making the title appropriate. In the remake, it really doesn't matter if it's Halloween or not - these events seem like they could have taken place whenever.) In the end, I'm amazed this remake got made, but then again, Zombie made two previous films before this one and I'm really amazed that those got made, so I guess this shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.

If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, you'll love this film. If you're a fan of John Carpenter, you'll definitely hate it. If you like angry rednecks yelling and swearing at each other every five seconds, you'll love this. If you like fleshed-out characters and actual acting, you'll hate this. If you enjoy gratuitous nudity and incomprehensible story plotting, you'll love this. If you enjoy competent filmmaking and a script worth being filmed, you'll hate this.

Maybe Zombie will remake ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" next because that... well, that... I'd be curious to see...

3178818,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie may as well be in the business of selling vacuum cleaners, for he has given a whole new meaning to the word 'suck'! I've never seen any of Zombie's trash, er, I mean films (if they could be called such), but I have heard from a LOT of people (friends/family/critics/strangers) that ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" was horrendous, a poor man's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", awful, dreadful, NOT scary, etc., etc. I had forgotten (like a LOT of people) that he had made a 2nd 'film', ""The Devil's Rejects"". How he was allowed to even make a 3rd, especially a remake of ""Halloween"" is SO beyond me!! When I 1st saw a trailer for it I thought it was yet another awful sequel, but NO, it's a remake...UGH! This is garbage. Yes, garbage! This is a vile piece of celluloid. It's a useless remake of a film that did NOT need a remake! Zombie took something and revamped it when it was something that didn't need to be touched.

Calling it a 'reimagined version' doesn't change the fact that it is still a REMAKE (and ""remake"" is just another name for ""theft""!) , and a totally unnecessary, unneeded, dreadful, awful, atrocious, sacrilige at that.

And, for the people posting on here ""Who cares about the original? It was boring and slow, and it took SO long to develop characters, which was a waste of time, cause you're just getting to know characters that are gonna get killed anyways?"", well, you all scare me more than this crap ever could! Where is your moral compass? Your moral center? Your moral core? In other words, your Human side? Just how dehumanized (not to mention how lowbrow) society has become is so frightening. Plus, you all miss the entire point of a horror movie, showing your ignorance to the mechanisms that make a scary movie successful; a rule of thumb that goes all the way back to the silent days of cinema: You MUST get to know the characters so you can feel for them, then therefore be scared when they start getting murdered.

It seems as though the mass viewing public doesn't feel the need for 'plot' these days, they just want the latest trend in being 'shocked' instead of being scared, and unfortunately they aren't educated enough to know the difference; or, they have become too dehumanized to even care. Just because Zombie loves horror does not mean he can make a good horror film.

What made ""Halloween"" so great: Pacing, and realistic situations, and realistic characters doing realistic things, and VERY creepy atmosphere and music. Plus, it is a very dark psychological film at heart. The way Michael Myers kills off Laurie Strode's friends, making sure she has no one to run to when he goes for her. And, none of them were running around a lake out in a deserted forest in the middle of the night like stupid airhheads screaming ""Here I am Mr. Murderer, come kill me!"" like they were in the senseless ""Friday The 13th"" movies, which were just clones of Carpenter's classic film. No, they were all doing very realistic things suburban teenagers (of that era) do: Smoke a bit of pot, go to school, baby sit, etc

Rob Zombie has raped/pillaged/stolen/ruined/destroyed everything that was great about this horror masterpiece (yes, masterpiece!) by tinkering around with something that didn't need fixing. He needs to be committed to the 'house of 1,000 corpses' and tortured by 'the devil's rejects' for this sacrilige! Poor Debra Hill is doing flips in her grave, for this is the second John Carpenter/Debra Hill film to be remade counting ""The Fog"". R.I.P. Debra! Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is considered a classic, and ranked among the likes of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" for a reason: It is a solid masterpiece of psychological horror, NOT just another slasher/horror film. It didn't need sequels, and sure as heck didn't need to be remade.

IF it had been a frame by frame/shot for shot remake, I might have given it a fairer shake, but to try and give 'history' to Mike Myers, and making his family look like white trash from ""The Jerry Springer Show"", well, he should have called it something else, because it is NOT ""Halloween""! I just don't find it necessary to have a 'backstory' on Michael Myers, well, other than the one that was put into ""Halloween II"", revealing that Laurie Strode was his younger sister. That was the only thing I like about ""Halloween II"", and wished there were some way to edit it into the original film.

I would urge anyone that wants to see what all the fuss is about to seek out the John Carpenter/Debra Hill classic, and see the film that has terrified audiences for over 30 years to this day, the last 15 minutes so intense, it could induce heart attacks; and forget this dog turd even exists! I mean, really, who's gonna be talking about Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" in a few years from now??? Except to say ""Avoid it like a rabid dog!"". People won't even remember it long enough to say that in another couple of years. It will fade away and rot like a rotten tomato, so it begs to question: WHY did Zombie waste his time remaking a classic when he could have at least tried to make something original (even though his 'original' films are just as forgettable as well)? This ranks in the same lowbrow category as Gus Van Zant's atrocious remake of ""Psycho"".

Sorry, but I'm trying NOT to think about anything in this film anymore. I'm trying REAL hard to forget it even exists, which really isn't that hard to do. Either way, good or bad, I do wish the remake cycle would come to a grinding halt! As for Zombie, well, I don't know what else to say, for I feel like he's a waste of breath (no offense), and his 'remake' is sucking trees out of the ground! AVOID!!

3178820,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's ""re-imagination"" of the 70s classic ""Halloween"" has several pros and several cons. My rating is 3 stars. Now I will break down my reasons. The first 40 minutes of this movie are fantastic! Zombie gives Michael Myers a childhood, a family and a cause for his ""evil"". In the original, Michael was a faceless supernatural force of nature. He existed just to kill and we never really found out why. Zombie tries to dig deep into the character of Michael and he tries to humanize him. I think he succeeds in the beginning, Michael as a child, played brilliantly by Daeg Farch is a sympathetic character. He lives in a hellish 70s environment, his mother Deborah is a stripper, his sister Judith a slut, his stepfather Ronnie verbally abuses everyone in the household. Michael's only respite is his infant sister who he calls Boo. This all comes to ahead one Halloween night when Michael wants to go trick-or-treating. Mom tells Sister to take Mike out but Sis is too busy getting banged by her bf. So Mike just sits on the porch while Mom strips and the rest of the family does their thing. Mike gets revenge by going postal on the whole family except for Boo. This is different than in the original as in this movie Mike kills 3 instead of just 1. This lands him at the sanitarium where he is counseled by Dr Loomis played well by the great Malcolm McDowell. Zombie does a great casting job by getting McDowell to replace the late great Donald Pleasance in the Loomis role. The interactions between McDowell and young Farch are some of the best scenes in the whole movie. Michael has murdered his entire family except his mother and baby sister yet he claims not to remember any of it. Michael wants to leave the sanitarium but of course he is not allowed to as Dr Loomis explains because he has ""done terrible things"". Due to his incarceration, Michael is slowly delving into madness. He is obsessed with making masks of all colors and kinds. This is a clever plot twist from the original movie. One day when Michael is being visited by Mom, Michael stabs a nurse with a fork. This scene is very well done by Zombie as all we hear is a siren going off yet we see Michael screaming at his mother because she took off his mask. The movie then jumps ahead 15 years. Michael is now a long-haired giant played by Tyler Mane. He still makes masks but now he is completely mute. Dr Loomis informs Michael that he is quitting because Michael is making no progress. Michael will now be transferred to a minimum security sanitarium. As he is being transferred by 4 armed guards Michael breaks his shackles and makes mincemeat out of his guards. This scene is dynamic and it proves that Rob Zombie is great at visuals and making dramatic scenes. The last great scene of this movie is where Michael invades a truck stop and kills a huge trucker for his clothes. There is a problem here though. Time has not seemed to have passed even though 15 years have gone by during Michael's incarceration. The music and fashions are still stuck in the late 70s. That's one con of this movie. The rest of the movie is basically a waste. Instead of doing something different Zombie decides to simply reshoot the entire original movie in the 30 minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, the actors that Zombie gets to play Laurie Strode and her friends are not real actors they just use expletives a lot and try to act like teenagers even though they all look on the wrong side of 25. Scout Taylor Compton who replaces the great Jamie Leigh Curtis in the Laurie Strode role is not fit to even shine Curtis' shoes with her tongue. She is an awful actress but she is not alone. The other ""actors"" that play her friends and the kid that plays Tommy Doyle are a complete waste and I will be surprised if they ever work in a movie again at least one not made by Rob Zombie. The last part of the movie feels completely rushed and forced. It's as if Zombie used all of his creativity in the first 40 minutes and with nothing left he just decides to reshoot the original again with lousy non-actors. I think that if Zombie reflects on this movie he will realize that he made a big mistake. The original movie did not need to be reshot. Also the whole brother-sister angle should have been trashed. In the original 1978 movie John Carpenter never intended for Michael and Laurie to be siblings. His idea was that Laurie was a virgin with no boyfriend and a lot of sexual frustration and somehow her frustration summons Michael back to his hometown.  He stalks and chases her because he is trying to be her lover but tragically he can't because he is insane. It is this idea that Zombie should have used for his re-imagination. The whole brother-sister angle was a cheap way that other directors used to make more sequels Carpenter NEVER intended for his original to have a sequel. If Zombie had used Carpenter's idea in a different way then he could've made something really special and a perfect remake, instead his remake deserves only 3 stars because of the first half of the movie, the last part of the movie is loud annoying and utterly unnecessary.",1305072000,,5124,4.515608180839613
3178821,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie seriously brings the horror movie experience to the next level. While combining the inherant creepiness that is Michael Myers with a pretty plausible backstory that at points borders on touching or at least an insight into the monster, this film hits all the right now. While it allows itself to fall prey to the formula that other horror movies fall into; teens have sex, breasts get shown, teen dies-these are necessary evils for Rob Zombie when releasing a horror film especially one as iconic as Halloween who knows he must pay homage to thsoe that came before. Not only does he do this, but he does it with style, giving depth to characters that on the whole, no one has significant screen time. One of the large failures I see in horror films, is their inability to humanize the victims of the monsters that destroy them. Not so in this movie, instead the viewer gets to look into the eyes of the victims along with Michael Myers and the sheer terror reflected there reveals a film that must have been toughly directed because Rob Zombie somehow has his actors and actresses show real terror. Don't listen to anybody's opinion, even this reviews, when going into watching this film, just do so with an open mind and go from there.",1301356800,2,1247,4.647058823529412

Tyler Mane is also good in his monstrous killer instict as Michael Myers. Sheri Moon Zombie & Scout Taylor Compton are also good in their portrayals of Deborah Myers & Lauri Strode characters. The only blunder that director Rob Zombie committed was to give an uncessesary complete background of Michael Myers, thus dilluting the Myer's mystery that we've been accustomed to.

I think Rob Zombie's re-writing and direction was very well done, the performances were phenomenal, and overall the flick is a very effective study of psychosis and the tragedy of poverty, apathy, and mental illness in our society.

But to have the title of ""Halloween""...

This ""re-imagining"" was obviously done with a love of the original, and again I hasten to say I didn't DISlike it, but it just does not come close to the magic found in Carpenter's masterpiece.  Too many other reviewers here have pointed out what is MY primary issue with it...the humanization of Michael Myers robs him of the menacing fear that he carried in the original film.

That fear is inevitably replaced with a kind of grudging sympathy.  Regardless of his brutality or the fact that he's now about nine feet tall and weighs about a thousand pounds, we can't help but feel sorry for the poor child we get to know and share heartache with in the first half-hour or so of the film.  Those of us who have seen it, admit it; are there any of us out here that didn't think his first two killings were justified?  Did we not, albeit in a fantastic sense of horror-film viewing, feel that those first two victims got what they deserved?

After that, it was easy to swallow his fall into psychosis and at least partially not hold him to blame for what he did.

The cinematography and acting is superb; Scout Taylor-Compton is excellent in her starring role, Malcolm McDowall was an inspired choice to take up the mantle of Dr. Loomis, and Tyler Mane is an intimidating screen presence, with or without the signature Mask.  Add in Danny Trejo in a wonderfully sympathetic performance (which only adds to the sadness we ultimately feel for Michael, although it seems to try to make us hate him), William Forsythe in a grimy and easily hated part, and the wonderful Dee Wallace in a small but convincing role, and you have all that is needed for a great horror film...

...and we get a very good one, but not if you were like I was, and hoping (perhaps naively so) for the same level of horror and fear we got in 1978.

Well worth the watch; you won't feel you've wasted your time on it, but don't be expecting the hair on the back of your neck to be doing the two-step as you sit in dread for the grim, masked spectre of Myers...instead, expect to feel disgusted with the illustrated failings of family, society, and the mental-health system.

My one hangup about the film is the creation of an ""origin story"" for Mike Meyers.

The circumstances leading up to his career as a homicidal maniac are a little cliche: he comes from a dysfunctional family  with an abusive father.

The creepiness of the original Mike Meyers is that he was a seeming normal child from a normal home who one day murders his sister for no discernible reason.

So for that, it looses points. Otherwise a great flick.",1273276800,2,532,4.5
3178836,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is a pathetic attempt to remake an even more pathetic original. To a risibly threadbare story line, Zombie adds horrible acting by a trio of dumb bimbos, profane language solely for shock value, and a cliched introductory sequence offering a glimpse into Michael Myers's past. As a horror buff, I can't understand the seemingly widespread attraction to depictions of senseless gore (e.g., the truck stop bathroom scene, the introductory throat slicing scene of the stepfather). The power of horror to scare lies in forces unseen or psychological demons, not marauding oafs following their victims in plain view. Such obvious sensationalist tripe as Zombie's directorial efforts should only impress those with IQs of 80. The only thing I would like to see Michael Myers do is time travel back to 1978 and bludgeon the whole inane series out of its misery.

It keeps characters from the original but things are different, that is good. It goes more in depth which I think could have been a bad thing, but it was pulled off well. So far, I have thought all of Rob Zombie's movies have sucked. I guess eventually you have to get something right, I'm glad it was this movie. Now for things I don't like. I hate these Blu-Ray movies that are Director's Cut and Unrated Versions. I just want the Theatrical Cut. Now I am probably in the minority on this but oh well. It's my review. I wish they would give you the theatrical version with the option of adding the footage in if you want. I thought Aliens Vs. Predator on DVD was perfect. To bad they can't all be like that. The thing I don't like about the movie. The ending. It is way to drawn out. I mean dang man, I kept watching it thinking how much longer can this thing drag out. I mean the ending of this movie has seriously put a damper on it's replay value. I want to watch it again but all I can think of is man, that's a long ending to go through again - wheres the cut the crap ending version, I want to buy that one. That's why I'm giving it 4 Stars instead of 5. OK, with that out of the way. I'd say buy it.

3178838,3,B000VKL6Z2,"What a travesty! Not so much that Halloween has been remade, but that Zombie's take on Michael Myers begins so well only to end up being a turd. I resisted seeing this upon release, but finally gave in when it available to me for free. The idea of one of my favorite films of all time being messed with just didn't sit right with me.

I must admit that for the first 50 minutes I was genuinely captivated. Originally I was appalled by the prospect of fleshing out Michael Myer's childhood. What made it work was that this was clearly Zombie's vision. I could accept it because I didn't feel that this had anything to do with Carpenter's Michael Myers. It felt more like Zombie's fantasy of what Michael Myers childhood had been like in a white trash family and how it led to his murderous spree. Of course the scariest thing about the original Myers is that there is no apparent reason for his evil. He's a blank slate which all sorts of fears can be projected on. For Zombie that projection is having a stripper mom who has a boyfriend who threatens to ""skull f*&k"" her. This all works because it is clearly Zombie's universe.

The film goes down hill and I mean tumbling down when Zombie enters Carpenter's territory. The film becomes all to familiar in that its plot begins to mirror Carpenter's original. By no means is Zombie able to pay homage or even copy Carpenter in a compelling manner. What has to be the worst aspect of this is the actresses who play the three teenage girls. All of them are horrible, and what's most unforgivable is how awful the girl is who play Laurie Strode. This is the character who was played by Jamie Lee Curtis, who gave an iconic performance in the original. All this girl does is shriek and talk like some valley girl. Imagine this line, ""so like was that the boogie man"". Now I'm not sure if these were her exact words, but that's what her character is like. The biggest abomination of this fiasco is that it's not even scary. The set pieces just make you wish you were watching the original. Zombie only comes close only once to an effectively scary scene when Laurie is trapped in a drained pool. She can't get out and Myers is in hot pursuit. What kills this creative sequence is that you really could care less if the girl lives or dies. More will actually probably wish her to die.

Never before have I seen a director construct a psychopath from the ground up the way it was done in this movie.  Usually you just have to accept that there's a crazy guy running around butchering people.  Here, we see a disturbed child with sadistic tendencies twisted by life in an institution into psychopathic madness.

Allow yourself to consider life in Michaels his head and let Zombie take you on a journey that is totally believable and terribly frightening.

3178840,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I actually thought this film was (maybe) half-decent and wrote a reasonably complimentary review...that is, until I watched the original 1978 Halloween again the other night!

I cannot think of any remake that misses the point so completely as Rob Zombie does here. The power of the original Halloween film lies in several factors:

1) The sheer blankness of the killer, about whom we literally know almost nothing from the start of the film to it's end. His motives, his inner life, his personality, remain ominously hidden.

2) The dread that builds up from hinting at horrors to come, which is helped on by us barely glimpsing the killer until he begins his rampage towards the end of the film.

3) Most importantly - John Carpenter's masterfully eerie direction, which lends a deeply unsettling air even to a shot of an empty surburban street.

So what does Rob Zombie do? He completely strips away all the mystery and dread right from the very first scene, by tirelessly trying to fill in the blanks in Michael Myers' life! We don't want them filled in, for heaven's sake, that's the whole point!

It pains me to say this (because this was obviously a labour of love) but RZ really couldn't have missed the point any more if he'd tried.

Having said all that, this film is still better than any of the sequels (with the possible exception of Halloween H2O). It's certainly better than a lot of slasher films on the market, although at over 2 hours it is far too long to be truly effective even on that score.

I really wouldn't want kids watching this. I thought the R-rated stuff had to wait until 1am to air. For example, the 'smashing the bully's head in' scene early in the movie. Also, in that scene, after the pause when you think Michael may let the kid live, I would have just went to Michael bringing the club/stick/shovel for a final blow then fade to black. But what do I know. I also actually wondered, when young Michael finally shuts down in the mental hospital, how many other kids would do the same thing under the same circumstances. I'm only referring to the shutting down part. Not the killing. I agree with the others about Mike's size. Unnecessary, although I was stunned when I saw him stand up. I really thought he would let the Janitor live. Now the 2nd half, after Mike escapes, pretty much blows. The entire movie is fairly predictable, but the lousy 2nd half was just too 'campy'?

Like the escape scene where Michael kills all the security gaurds and gets out that is changed to a new escape scene. The story it's pretty cool, in the beginning of the story there's a how story behind the reason Micheal does what he does, like what he did when he was a kid.

This remake is different from the original and Zombie's remake of Halloween came as a total surprise to me; I didn't expect to like it at all and thought that he was going to ruin a classic of horror films. It goes deeper into the original Halloween story which I thought was fascinating and well done, it explains things and gives the movie more depth. I liked how the movie started with Michael Myers as a child and the flashback sequences which explained what just happened as Myers killed members of his family. You see an interview with Myers as a child and the setting is very interesting it tries to explain what happened. Then the movie progresses to the point where he is older and escapes from prison and murders people. There is more gore and everything seems more brutal than in the original which was to be expected and makes it more according to today's standards in horror movies. Some things are different and entertaining and are not an exact copy of the original scene by scene which I thought was well done and creative of Rob Zombie. It's like he took the movie and added things to it and made it his own.

Most remakes tend to be pretty bad (even if there are some great ones) and contrary to what many fans thought of Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween I actually enjoyed it and found it was a decent remake. Make no mistake this remake is not as good as the original one and it will never be I just think it was good and that it gave the movie an interesting twist to it.

3178849,5,B000VKL6Z2,"If you're autistic, like I am, you'll probably want to thrill to this documentary which explores the link between autism and mass violence.  You see, Michael Meyers, like most autistics, finds himself lost in a world he never made.  A world populated by frighteningly vulgar and loud neurotypicals who encroach relentlessly, victimizing him until he lashes out with great and fiery vengeance, laying waste to the sordid humanoids around him in a blistering blaze of white heat.  The sister's boyfriend who got put down with an alunimum bat was particularly deserving of this fate, by the way.  Just before getting his head beaten in, you see him fashioning a sandwich from noisesome cold cuts.  He's the type of person who has absolutely no personality whatsoever, apart from a basic sloppiness of demeanor and a shaggy mane of hair that is in the process of fusing into white dreads.  Such a pity his early demise.  The world has lost so very much.

Michael then is unjustly incarcerated just for being a freedom fighter.  His mother can't take how great he is, and so she blows her brainz out.  Whatta shame.  So then Michael lays waste to some worthless hillbillies and busts right out of the mental hooskow, leading the resident psychiatrist and stereotypical liberal to bleat ""ooohh... oooh!""

Flash forward to later that night.  More people need Michael to give them a proper seeing to, which he does, very autistically.  You see, the man behind the mask is the perfect metaphor for autism.  The sense of disconnect and alienation, the sense of needing shelter... add in the fact that the original Meyers mask was adapted from a rubber mask of Captain Kirk (William Shatner interpretation) and we've come full circle.

Well, after seeing it...I have to tell ya, Rob didn't hit a home run but his new vision and re-telling of Carpenter's ""classic"" Halloween is a solid hit. He stuck to the basic story and plot (rearranged some things) and completely re-vamped Halloween into something much better (he got rid of allot of the hokeyness that was in the original). While not perfect (I had an issue with the ""time line"") I can look past that one discrepancy, it played out much smoother and with less down time.

Zombie's version of Halloween is far more violent and shows much more graphic detail. I liked the back story that gave you a better glimpse to how Michael Meyers came to be and the meaning behind ""the mask"". Halloween purists will argue that Zombie revealed too much by giving too much away and spending too much time on other details. Those are the minute minority that are just hung up on Carpenter's classic and are unwilling to accept a new version of the film.

You can't compare the two films. While similar in character and plot, they are completely two different animals. Carpenter's Halloween will always be the ""cult classic"" and what Zombie was attempting to do (and executed well) was make it ""his film"". Doing a complete carbon copy of the original would have been pointless and an insult to the original. I'm glad that Zombie manned up and took the reins on this one giving it quite a different look and feel. Dirty, gritty, cruel and ferocious to the end.

3178855,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Remakes often fail, especially when based on classic material, as they are constantly compared to the original. It may be unfair, but it is inevitable.  So, with the remake of a movie as good and as well known as Halloween, Rob Zombie was stepping into some very big shoes.  What was interesting to me, is how the portions of the movie that had nothing to do with the original were far more interesting to me than those which were a remake.  While nothing necessarily unique, watching Mike Myers as a young boy, with all sorts of problems, mental and social, was rather interesting.  In some ways, leaving this movie as a prequel rather than a prequel/remake would have been advised.  Once the movie decided to become a remake I largely lost interest, knowing who was going to die, and constantly feeling that it had been done before dragged the movie down a notch.  When Laurie finally asks ""Was that the boogie man?"" I cringed, as it felt so out of place, and a forced nod to the original.

It's a shame really that the remake portion detracted from the what could have otherwise been something interesting.  I think Rob Zombie had shown some real darkness and great film making in the dark and sadistic devil's rejects, and was hoping for more from this.  While I got some interesting moments, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Maybe his sequel will cure the defects of the remake, and stick to being its own entity.

3178856,3,B000VKL6Z2,"After reading the dead-on ""Needless Look Behind The Curtain"" review (good job Miles!), I just wanted to add that Zombie not only missed the point but took too many cheap liberties.  There are alot of swearing just for the sake of swearing moments that leave me underwhelmed.  Usually when theres a lack of any real substance in a movie (typically in horror or ""gangsta"") foul language can be used as ""padding"", kind of like puddy to fill the cracks in an otherwise spotty stretch of dialogue.  Many of Michael's murder sequences are very dark and confusing and continue for lengthy periods.  While I like this effect when used in restraint (a key concept lacking in Zombie's movies), it is actually distracting to the point of leaving these dramatic moments ineffectual.  Nothing is ever dramatic in a Zombie film because the man has no RESTRAINT.  Like ""Full Metal Jacket"", this movie has 2 parts: childhood/incarceration; adulthood/escape.  This first part is wonderfully done but relies too much on schlocky sex angles and that language.  I do like the retro 70's vibe of the first part and I can go with the Michael Myers childhood storyline if need be.  Michael's new history seemed plausible and made Michael more human.  Like Miles said in his review, this human element ruins the 2nd part where he takes on those immortal qualities we've all grown up with.  Another complaint about the darkness of many scenes is I can't tell if Laurie shoots Michael in the head at the end or what.  Why was she able to recover from the balcony fall with Michael faster than him?  HUH??  There are a few grey areas in this movie to say the least.

Zombie, nontheless, comes up with a stellar cast (Malcolm MacDowell, Mickey Dolenz, and even Richard Lynch ""Seven-Ups"") and their bright performances all but save this movie.  Halloween fans may be divided and some I'm sure will like this movie.  As far as I'm concerned, Dr. Loomis has nothing to apologize to Michael over!",1255737600,,1964,4.7804154302670625
3178857,2,B000VKL6Z2,"My first reaction to Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN was: ""Why?"" The film is near-perfect as it is, and didn't need to be remade or, as the idiotic studio-suit buzzword goes, ""re-imagined."" But what the hell. Since Hollywood isn't interested in new ideas, and Zombie has apparently run out of such ideas as he has, I guess it was inevitable. This leads me to my second reaction, post-watching-the-film, which is, ""Is Rob Zombie a f-ing idiot or what? Doesn't he get why this was a good movie in the first place?""

I don't say this to be abusive. I do believe Zombie has some talent and aesthetic style. The problem is that his style - at least as it pertains to HALLOWEEN -- is the wrong one. You don't use a sledgehammer to do a flyswatter's job, and you don't let a sadistic, gore-infatuated fanboy direct a horror masterpiece. The original HALLOWEEN was great for a lot of reasons, but chief among them, it didn't overanalyze its villain. And this is the real point that needs to be made here, because what Zombie does to his HALLOWEEN is part of an much wider and sillier trend in modern horror - the need to provide a reason why its killers do what they do.

If I had to sum up the original, John Carpenter-directed version of the film in one phrase, it would be this: ""Yes, Virginia, there really is a Boogeyman."" That's basically it. The motivations of the film's masked, mouth-breathing murderer, Michael Myers, are never explained to any meaningful degree, because - gasp! - they don't have a rational explanation. Michael doesn't get an ""origin story""; no insight is provided as to why he murdered his sister Judith as a young boy, or why he's re-enacting the crime on a much larger scale as an adult. He's killing Because. Just BECAUSE. That's as much why as you get. It's almost Biblical. (""Who are you?"" Moses asks the burning bush. ""Who I AM."" God replies. ""I Am Who I AM."") As Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) explains to the Sheriff, Michael is not so much a human being as an embodiment of Evil itself, a Bad Thing that Happens to Good People. He's the Book of Job in a William Shatner mask. (That's why, incidentally, he's credited at the end of the film not as Michael Myers, but as ""The Shape"": he's taken the shape of your fears, whatever they might be.) But HALLOWEEN is not less scary for this lack of information. Quite the contrary. It's scarier precisely because we don't get the satisfaction. There is no ""Why?"" where Michael is concerned. He just Is.

Zombie isn't satisfied with that answer, and so he's approached the film from a different angle - the angle of the ""origin story."" Here, Michael's origin is that as a child, he was abused, neglected, picked-on, and basically f'd from birth. As a result, he developed into an unspeaking, sadistic, remorseless killer. Very neat. Very plausible. And completely missing the point. Because by reducing Michael to a set of influences, mere cause and effect, he's also taking away nearly all his power as a villain. There's a reason we don't look behind the curtain in Oz; we might discover the Wizard is a sweaty dwarf on a treadmill. That's not cool. That's boring. And so is this film. Because not only does Zombie ruin the best aspect of HALLOWEEN - the almost-supernatural Boogeyman angle - he also viciously stomps the other aspect that made the original special -  its sense of restraint. Carpenter had enough sense to understand that what is left out of a movie is often just as important as what is left in. Instead of a few perfectly set-up and executed murders, we get a gigantic massacre that quickly numbs. Instead of a few drops of blood, we get buckets of steaming gore (always the first refuge of the hack who can't actually scare his audience). Instead of long cat-and-mouse games with totally unsuspecting victims that rack up the tension to an unbearable degree, climaxing in sudden death, we get drawn-out bludgeonings, followed by nonfatal stabbings, followed by near-escapes, followed by more bludgeonings and finally, fatal stabbings. Zombie's complete lack of subtlety, his refusal to leave anything to the imagination, isn't just bad film-making in and of itself; it's completely unsuited to the telling of this particular tale. Using him to do a HALLOWEEN remake is like using a rusty chainsaw to perform eye surgery.

I suppose you could make an argument that since this is a remake (excuse me, a ""re-imagining""), Zombie was entitled, even obligated, to go in a different direction than Carpenter, one which has Dr. Loomis actually apologizing to Michael for ""failing"" him instead of blasting him with a .38, 'cause tha's what you do with Pure Evil when you find it. But even here the film falls down, because if Michael is a pure sociopath, as Malcom McDowell's version of Loomis maintains, Loomis has little to apologize for. See, while the jury's still out about whether a psychopath/sociopath can be actually be ""made"" in childhood (as opposed to simply ""born wrong"") there is universal agreement that neither sociopathy nor psychopathy are actually curable. How can a doctor fail the incurable? And this brings us back to the whole idea that made Carpenter's flick scary: that pure Evil is something outside of human influence, happening on its own terms for its own reasons and not subject to psychological analysis or treatment. (Donald Pleasance's Loomis ultimately got that Michael couldn't be ""reached"" - except by bullets.) Put simply, the genius of the original HALLOWEEN is that it ducked all the moral-psychological elements Zombie embraces and concentrated on one simple idea, best summed up by the last two lines of dialogue in the film:

LAURIE STRODE: (sobbing) Was that the Boogeyman?

From bullies to a broken home it was no wonder why he suddenly started killing people! Back then in the original one we didn't know why he killed people, he came from a nice home which was what made the not knowing terrifying, he came up pretty good as a kid.  I just think Zombie wanted to show us what his childhood was probably like and if so then well all I got to say is DO IN YOUR MOVIES FILLED WITH THE SAME TRASH AND LEAVE THE CLASSICS ALONE! Seriously another thing that was stupid and this is nothing bad on Scout who played Laurie but seriously how are we to believe the girl is his sister he's over 6'0 tall and the girl looks 12! In the original ones it was believable as a grown woman played the sister!

Definitely more suspenseful then the original and just as entertaining. However, this movie is much more graphic and is definitely above and beyond your typical new slasher film with a twist of Rob Zombie's humor added in as well. One thing I do complain about is that Rob has to put his damn wife in every movie he does. Don't get me wrong I like her and she is very attractive, but sometimes you just have to get someone else. With her being in it, it brings back a House of a Thousand Corpses vibe or Devils Rejects. Despite that this movie is definitely worth a view....",1254528000,,729,4.488721804511278

And to me that's a good thing; Zombie attempts to re-invent the Michael Myers character in his version versus basically doing over what was already done masterfully with the original.

So what I suggest that you do is go into this movie with the above understanding. Because if you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptation will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was quite entertained by Zombie's Halloween. After all, a simple re-do that adds nothing new to what was already solidly in place would be pointless, right?

Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.

The first half of the movie is devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie starts by showing Myers' at age 10 or 11. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The movie flash forwards 15 years through Myers incarceration and ultimate escape to wreak havoc on the infamous town of Haddonfield just like in the original.

The first half of the movie is very well done to the point I was saying to myself that ""this is a great movie."" But then in the second half it collapses a bit with too many clich&eacute; horror movie ""oh that would never really happen"" moments. You know, like the police don't believe there's any danger and they're stupid; people venturing into places that you know they'd never go...especially on the heels of the warning that Myers could be in town; and the whole point of the first half of the movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.

But, like I said, I was entertained. The cast is pretty good, and the kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. This re-make is definitely worth a watch for horror fans, but devoted fans of the original might want to take a pass.",1253750400,,2545,4.923076923076923

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake does this. The My Bloody Valentine remake does this. The Friday the 13th remake does this. But Rob Zombie didn't do that, regardless of all of the things he has done.
  Comparing this to the original is like comparing Frank Oz's Little Shop of Horrors to Corman' s. Of course Frank Oz's is different. It's a musical. It stars Rick Moranis, It was made twenty years later for another audience and it burlesques the silliness of the original. Complaining that this ruins Halloween or lacks the atmosphere of the original is completely missing the point. Zombie has taken a movie with strong Giallo influence and infused it with splatpunk. It is not a thriller, it is a gritty, brutal slasher film that is not meant to have socially redeeming qualities but rather to bring Myers into the 21st century. It doesn't completely succeed at this. Zombie deserves some praise for deciding to make Michael Myers more than The Shape, but he does it in sort of a derivative fashion and he doesn't put Myers into our world but rather his.

3178870,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Halloween (Rob Zombie, 2007)

Despite my contempt for the current Hollywood remake craze, I somehow can't stop myself from watching them despite knowing that almost every remake will find some way to mess itself up, even when it tries to be slavishly faithful (think Gus van Sant's shot-by-shot Psycho remake here). It's very rare that a remake gets it even half-right, and when someone does a remake and attempts to add something, that way lies madness. Except when it works. I know I'm probably in the minority in thinking so--after all, the whole reason Michael Myers is scary in John Carpenter's classic Halloween is that we have absolutely no idea how he got that way, save for one scene at the beginning of the movie that tells us he's already messed up by the time he's ten years old--but I think Rob Zombie giving us Michael Myers' backstory in his Halloween remake actually works.

In case you've been underwater for the last thirty years, the plot: a youngster named Michael Myers (played as a youth by Hancock's Daeg Faerch, as an adult by X-Men's Tyler Mane), sick of his abusive family, snaps and offs his stepfather and older sister. When his mother (played by Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon) gets home from her shift at the strip club, Myers is sitting outside the house holding his baby sister. Following this bit, we get half an hour of Myers growing up in the institution, being counselled by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, about as perfect a replacement for Donald Pleasance as possible). Myers, of course, breaks ourt and heads back to Haddonfield, spending the rest of the film terrorizing Laurie Strode (Wicked Little Things' Scout Taylor-Compton) and her pals.

Why does the backstory bit work here? Because Rob Zombie actually thought about it. From the looks of things, he spent years thinking about it. I grant you, it's pretty basic slasher-movie psychology these days--you have to try and make the killer sympathetic by showing that he was abused as a kid or whatever--but the kicker is that Zombie never once attempts to make Michael Myers in any way sympathetic. (You get the feeling for a while he's going to, but he resists the temptation.) It's a subtle subversion of that same slasher-movie psychology Zombie is borrowing wholesale, and it works. In fact, it's kind of brilliant, if you turn your head and squint the right way. Unfortunately, the film falls apart after that, becoming as generic a slasher movie as has come down the pike in some time, but the promise of the first half tells me Rob Zombie may actually be putting it together as a filmmaker. Much better than I expected. ***",1251331200,,2618,4.800443458980045
3178871,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Being a huge fan of the original Halloween and not exactly ""liking"" Rob Zombie, but respecting that he is attempting to be somewhat creative, I decided to give this movie a try.  There were so many things wrong with it I can't even decide where to start.  May as well go with the cast: The ""new Laurie"" was so annoying to watch my sister and I instantly elbowed each other when we saw this in the theater.  The teenagers in the original Halloween were what teenagers are supposed to be: not 'tweens that screech and twist their faces and bob their heads with every line of dialogue.  Also, her screaming was enough to make me crazy by the end of the movie.  I'll move on to the young Michael Myers:  he looked like an overweight and not so cute Dakota Fanning.  His acting was also so bad that it was distracting.  The bedhead hair in the eyes got old after about 2 minutes.  Not scary, just annoying. The only saving grace in the cast was Tyler Mane - very scary and tall.  And almost mysterious....  Almost.
Next, I'll address the whole premise of this ""remake"":  Why is it that Rob Zombie has to white trash everything up?  I totally agree with other reviewers that the whole POINT and the whole thing about Michael that is SCARY is that we have no idea what made him lose it.  Mystery is something that escapes Rob Zombie and that he will never be able to duplicate from the original Halloween.  Stick with the Saw over-the-top-gore-screaming-violence Rob, because true fear and mystery is not something you are skilled in presenting on screen.",1251244800,37,1548,4.517985611510792

3178873,5,B000VKL6Z2,"In honor of writing my demonic-numbered review, I thought I'd pick one of my favorites! I love Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (NOT the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans!

HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psychopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time?

3178874,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I am a huge fan of the original Halloween, so took a chance on this one.  Although I always thought that the original film left gaps in the story...why was Michael the way he was?...yes, Rob answered this for us folks, but how difficult it was to watch this poor boy living in this over the top dysfunctional home! It makes sense to the story, but I found it too disturbing to watch. He was a much more believable Michael, we understood where he was coming from, his pain was too huge for a young child to handle...but did I really want to know these details and suffer along with this young boy?  Heck, no! To top it all off, Zombie movies (which I should have known!) are far too grotesque and bloody for my taste.  The original movie had just the right amount of gore, suspense, scary music and fear.  I didn't need to be taken to the next level of horror, so I shut the movie off.  I never finished it because what I had seen was more than enough.  I wondered, afterward, about our society and what makes us love these type of movies.  If these horrific events happened to anyone we knew, we wouldn't be so anxious to watch them on the big screen. The fact is that the world is hard enough, scary enough, dark enough...we hardly need to be on a journey of insanity for two hours and then watch the bonus features so we can see more about how they made the gore fest come to life! This one is just over the top, and not enough of an improvement on the original to make it worth seeing.  Watch some quality horror, something that scares you, but doesn't make you want to be sick.",1250121600,12,1581,4.229235880398671
3178875,2,B000VKL6Z2,"A few aspects of the film are actually quite good. Tyler Mane is a great Michael Myers. He's almost seven feet tall and is built like a giant. He's a total monster and the destruction and mayhem he causes is believable given his size. The adult version of Michael Myers is spot-on for a re-imagining of the film. Malcolm McDowell also does a good job as Dr. Loomis. He's no Donald Pleasance, but McDowell's take on the character isn't bad. Scout Taylor-Compton is also a worthy mention. She slips into the shoes of a modern day Laurie Strode rather flawlessly. Moving on from the acting though, the film is pretty solid from the time Michael gets his iconic mask through the finale. The way Michael made so many masks while he was in Smith's Grove was an interesting idea and the scene where you see his room fifteen years later with nothing but masks on every wall is one of the best in the film. The cinematography is also something that is often overlooked, which is a shame since it's actually pretty exceptional. It seemed to stand out most during the scenes where Michael was stalking Laurie, especially in the abandoned Myers house at the end. There's a scene right after Michael gets out of Smith's Grove where he goes to a truck stop and winds up getting the jumpsuit we're all familiar with. While there, he runs into Big Joe Grizzly in the bathroom stall and is banging Grizzly's hand, which is holding a knife, against the bathroom stall wall. As he's doing this though, the bathroom stall is just getting demolished but with every smashing blow, the camera violently shakes. The camera just always seemed to have a knack for giving a good perspective of what the character was going through, whether it was Michael or Laurie.

The disappointing part of this is pretty much everything leading up to Michael getting his mask back after his escape is pretty terrible. The dialogue, especially in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film, is horrendous. Everything that's said between Deborah Myers and Ronnie White is just awful. The white trash upbringing just doesn't seem worthy for a horror icon like Michael Myers. It's just hard to believe that Michael Myers is the way he is because his mom was a stripper and his older sister was a whore. Logic seems to just be thrown by the way side as the film progresses. After Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, he returns to his old house where his mask and knife that he used to kill his family happen to just be lying under the floorboards. So did the police just pick up the bodies without searching the house or what? So he got his jumpsuit by stealing it from a guy taking a dump at a truck stop? Really? Hearing some of the original music return from John Carpenter's version of the film was a bit bittersweet. On one hand, it was great hearing it again. On the other, however, it just didn't seem to fit. Made me miss the original film more than anything. Giving Michael Myers a specific origin was probably Zombie's biggest mistake. The most terrifying thing about Michael Myers was that he was The Shape and had a bit of mystery to him. You knew he was going after Laurie, but other than that you had Loomis' word to fall back on. Michael was the human incarnation of pure evil. That's it. That's all you need. Humanizing the character and introducing us to his childhood only watered down the Michael Myers character.

There's a scene with Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis in Smith's Grove Sanitarium where Michael has made a mask that he's colored completely black. When Loomis asks him why it's black, Michael says that it's his favorite color. Loomis goes into an explanation about the color spectrum. Black is on one end and is the absence of color while white is at the opposite end and is every color. That's actually a great explanation of the differences between the original film and the remake. The original film would be the black segment of the spectrum. Carpenter's version leaves more to the viewer's imagination as the only explanation for Michael Myers is that he is ""pure evil."" While the remake would be the white segment of the spectrum as it goes into full detail why Michael Myers is the way he is and it shows every little violent and vulgar detail. Some people would say that having a little bit of mystery would be a good thing when it comes to a film like this while others like having everything laid out for them. It all depends on the viewer and which end of the spectrum they prefer. In my opinion though, that's the biggest mistake Rob Zombie made. There's no mystery left with the Michael Myers character. He's no longer The Shape, but is a psychopathic killer because he was raised by a white trash family, liked to torture animals, and whose sister didn't take him trick or treating.",1249862400,2,4784,4.587616822429907
3178876,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a hard movie to review.  For one thing, I don't want to compare it to the original Halloween, since the original is supposed to be a classic and therefore, untouchable.

Something was wrong with the pacing in this remade version though.

The movie started off SO good when it was dealing with the little kid going crazy and killing everyone in sight.  He was being picked on at school by a bully, a stepfather that treated him poorly, and a sister he didn't like.  The only person the little boy liked was his mother.

There was a disturbing aspect to the storyline in that watching the little boy kill people in graphic ways time and time again, you begin to realize for the boy there's no compassion for human life whatsoever.  A disturbing side of the horror genre when it deals with realistic and dangerous subjects such as that.

They even touched upon the subject of whether the little boy actually felt anything when he was doing the killing.  Apparently not.

This movie must have some kind of record for the most killings in a movie, haha.  Time and time again people would get slaughtered, smashed, stabbed, you name it, but the same unstoppable insane lunatic roaming the streets and suburbs.

The main problem with the movie was how it started off so darn good and gradually got worse and worse until eventually you knew what was going to happen at the very end.  To me this is inexcusable for a movie that should have kept a consistent momentum that it had for the first hour or so.  Seriously, the first hour of the movie was pure horror perfection.  It just failed to keep the same exciting pace for the last 40 minutes or so because the final segments of the film were so predictable.

The subject of the killer trying to find his sister had potential, but never delivered.  What was he planning to do with his baby sister once he found her?  Also, why did he kill that guy who was supposed to be his friend back at the psychiatric hospital?  The killer had no sympathy for someone that honestly cared about him for several years, you think he would have given the guy a break.

But the most important thing is that the movie turned into a rather ordinary slasher horror by the second half of the movie, failing to come through.  I'll be generous and give the movie 4 stars anyway because I really did enjoy the first half of the movie with all the creative and constant killing action.",1249084800,,2410,4.481651376146789

Well, I watched HALLOWEEN last night, and couldn't believe how wrong I was! Zombie has not simply rehashed the original, he has recast it in a more modern and psychologically satisfying way. John Carpenter's Michael Myers was perfect for his day (and for any day, really)- a silent, faceless, relentless killing machine, without any personal history. A murderous enigma. Zombie has given Michael motivation and purpose. He has fleshed-out his childhood, much like HANNIBAL RISING did for Lector. I look at Zombie's HALLOWEEN as a seperate and completely different movie from the original. In the same way that I love both the originals and the remakes of DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE HILLS HAVE EYES for example, I can watch and enjoy either HALLOWEEN. Tyler Mane is an awesome, imposing Michael. He seems like he's 9 ft tall! Giving him a back-story did not lessen his horrifying and utterly lethal character.

What makes me the most sad  is that some kid in the next 10 years will read a review of how Halloween is on the list of best horror movies ever made and will pick up this garbage instead of the original.

3178884,3,B000VKL6Z2,"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE 3-DISC UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT ONLY!

I'm a little late on this one.  I saw it with everyone else two years ago, and saw the unrated cut about a year ago.  I didn't loathe the film as much as the fanboy purists, but I also didn't love the film as much as the new fanboys who seem to like anything that was made within the last ten years.  To me this film is half original brilliance and half uninspired mediocrity.  Hence, the three star rating.  But the actual three disc set gets a five star rating, but I'll get to that in a minute.

First off, the unrated director's cut is miles ahead and better then the cut shown theatrically.  We get more character beats, especially with Dr. Loomis and Michael's break-out scene is  done more realistically.  Zombie spends so much time making Michael a real human being in this film that it always boggled my mind how he escaped like Superman in the theatrical cut.  The director's cut not only uses incidents torn from the past's headlines, it seems more in step with the new tone and mythology of Zombie's Michael Myers.  We also get more time spent in the asylum with young Michael.  It's really well written and directed stuff that helps further drive Zombie's main thesis regarding Michael home, and it's truly creepy and unsettling.  For horro movie nerds we get a couple more detailed horror icon cameos in the form of Courtney Gains(Children of the Corn) and Udo Kier(Andy Warhol's Dracula, Modern Vampires) and Clint Howard(c'mon, you know this guy!).  Though, we lose the theatrical cut's cameos by Devil's Rejects allumni, my persoal favorite being Bill Mosley('Dog will hunt!)

The problems with this remake vary.  Firstly, the opening breakfast scene is so over the top and silly that it's just annoying.  Obviously, Zombie had a loaded script and had to make a short cut in setting up this dysfunctional family, but it's not very believable or well done.  More importantly, Zombie takes some of the mythos and general mystery away from the Michael character by letting us get to know him and see that he was a regular kid with problems, major mental problems.  Unlike Carpenter's original where Michael was the personification of the unknown and faceless evil, Zombie just makes Michael your average American psycho.  It's interesting and unexpected but it is one of the factors that help in making the second half of the film not work.  I do appreciate the asylum scenes and I really like the relationship between young Michael and Loomis, played beautifully and tragically by Malcolm Mcdowell, leaving behind the kooky obsession of Donald Pleasance's Loomis.  The movie tries hard to make the viewer understand Michael and feel connected to him while being repulsed by what he is.  It's only half successful, and only in the first hour.

After about forty-five minutes the film switches into a total remake of the Carpenter film proper.  Unfortunately, the film is so top heavy that we never really get to know or care about Michael's future victims including Laurie Strode, and this is big gripe for me. Not being able to care about the characters or even differentiate them from one another is death to a horror film.  Many slasher films from the mid to late 80's made the same mistake and just became exorcises in gore special effects. Kudos to Zombie for holding back on the gore though.  Sure, this movie is way gorier then the original but it's not that gorey in general.  The violence is more implied with body twitches, murky lighting, sound effects and unsettling music stings by the great composer Tyler Bates.  So, all the folks who saw this film and claimed it to be more violent then it is, are just giving Zombie the ultimate compliment as a director.  Hitchcock achieved the same thing with his shower scene in Psycho, though this film is also more violent then that film for sure.  Different times and different strokes I guess.

While all the remake additions are interesting on their own right, the rushed and by the numbers remake section, the section with the real terror from the original, is slighted and less then desirable.  The finale is a great roller coaster ride, and I for one LOVE the final shot.  It was unexpected and leaves the audience unnerved for the future of the main character.  I don't think the film is a complete failure or terrible, but rather an underachiever with moments of originality and brilliance.  I would prefer Zombie to stick to original material then to remake ANYTHING.  I hold his Devil's Rejects in very high regard.  Maybe this summer's sequel Halloween 2, Zombie will perfect his original vision and not be shackled by following the original film's storyline.  Though, from the trailers I saw, Zombie's Halloween 2 seems to be set in a hospital.  NATCH.

The three disc set is AWESOME!  If you loved this remake it's a no-brainer, but the third disc is worth a look even if you didn't.  Hell, if you're an aspiring filmmaker at all the third 4-hour making of disc is a must see.  Zombie does, like Peter Jackson, his own bonus materials for his films and chronicles the whole production.  This doc really shows the filmmaking process in it's entirety like none other I've seen in a long while.  One really gets an inside look at how these things are done, and not the usual B.S. EPK material most DVDs come with that end up really being a commercial for the film that has the actors saying empty things like, ""Yeah, it was a really fun shoot.  Everyone's great.""  You really get to see what a director's ultimate role in a film is, from every level.  There's a great bit involving the location scouting that shows Zombie making the tiniest of alterations to a set.  An alteration the viewer wouldn't think twice about but is on the director's mind at all times.  The second disc is the same as the previous releases as is the commentary.  A really good commentary that doesn't repeat too much of the info found on either bonus disc.  Not to mention Zombie goes into detail regarding his decision for this remake as far as the visuals, the violence, color scheme, and performances--which are all good despite some of the underwriting on some of the characters.

Bottom line, this at least an interesting film, if not a great one.  I like it enough, while not being totally enamored of it.  I anticipate the sequel, and whether it's good or bad, I hope Zombie moves out of the remake business and gets back to making real films from his heart. Carpenter's Halloween is one of my favorite films of all time.  I hold it in high regard as far as horror cinema goes.  Carpenter himself is a filmmaker I use as a template for my own endeavors.  One thing that this remake tragically loses that the original had, and it was very important to the original, is that Michael was truly the boogeyman.  Some dialogue regarding the boogeyman, like the original, is peppered throughout the remake but it all seems moot considering how Zombie makes Michael so much more human.  He's not the boogeyman, he's a psycho with a motive only a psycho would understand or relate to.  The original Michael Myers was truly faceless and without motive, which made him scarier in his randomness, well until the original Halloween sequels screwed all that up.  This remake is no worse then the sequels, which were all mediocre in my opinion. Here's hoping for the future.",1242864000,3,7384,4.706157443491816
3178885,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This film is one of the few remakes that I like, and what Rob Zombie has done is made one hell of remake that has some brutal moments and has made Michael Myers more nasty then has ever been before.

The film kicks off trying to explain the events that led to Myers to kill and the results are not nice fast forward 15 years later and Michael Myers has escaped the nuthouse and heading back the Haddonfield and Dr Lomis has to try and find him and somehow stop him.

Rob Zombie's remake has had good and bad reviews but I did like this film, ok we all know this will never top the 1978 Film but this one stands well on it's own, what Halloween fans will notice on this one, is that this one has a lot of gore which the others rarely had and Michael Myers is more sadistic and brutal then he has ever been

The film has some good scare moments that will movie goers on edge.

3178886,1,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie was such a disgrace that I don't think I could write a review without it being so long it would take me an hour to type it all. Rob Zombie thinks he has the right idea, but he can't see past his ego and turn Halloween into something he believes it should be. Blood, gore and all of the other cliche slasher movie formula's. It is almost as if he does not know how to build suspense and atmosphere that can make a horror movie that much more creepy and frightening to watch.

The only part that I enjoyed was seeing Danielle Harris come back to the franchise as the character Annie Brackett, and topless as well!

So from now on, I will be avoiding anything from Rob Zombie in the future, he is a true letdown from such a horror movie buff.",1241568000,5,750,4.165517241379311

The film was new enough to be intriguing, pulling you into original story elements that were latter meshed with my familiarity of the classic. I had heard of the ""white trash"" origin that was given to Michael in this film, and I had thought I was going to despise that element.  However, it ground Michael into a reality, a harsh, gritty, completely possible reality, that made the film even more creepy.  I am so used to remakes that are completely disappointing, this one was indeed worth the effort.",1241308800,,609,4.559633027522936
3178888,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been wanting to slam this movie for some time and now that I have nothing better to do with my time here goes,
I respect Rob Zombie as a musician I love his work when he was with White Zombie, to this day it's one of my favorite bands. To me it seems you should stick with what you are good at if you were blessed with a talent of some sorts you should by all means try to hold on to that talent and make it grow. Rob Zombie is a great musician he should have known better than to dabble in other arts there was one instance where he was lucky however and that was the devils rejects for a fan of a good gory shoot em up movie that was good but, that was all just good. There was no need to remake this movie there was nothing wrong with the original. There was no reason to explain the killer and why he did what he did throughout the entire franchise it was already explained that he was pure evil. The original showed that Michael Myers grew up in a loving family that's what helped make the story good because nobody understood how a good family raised a killer child plain and simple. This movie ruined the credibility that the story once had. As a writer and a reviewer I must look at all sides of the movie and judge it fairly there were some parts I liked about it, the story actually made sense it seemed logical for Michael Myers to turn out a killer after his childhood was stolen from him, but there is a problem with that considering there has been a franchise of Halloween for a long time the classics never die until remakes like this come out it's about as bad as casting a rapper to be an actor (Halloween resurrection) I guess it's almost fair to say the franchise died when Busta Rhymes appeared in that movie the only good part was when he was stabbed, I am trailing off here so I guess I said what needed to be said about this movie, Rob stick with the music don't kill your career just yet.",1241136000,2,1919,4.1063829787234045
3178889,4,B000VKL6Z2,"As far as horror remakes go, I'm usually quick to write them as nothing more than just Hollywood's way of saying they have no other tricks up their sleeve & a remake is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Sadly, horror remakes rarely are as innovative nor as entertaining as the originals & most of them are financial flops at the box office. With the mere exception of perhaps a few, I could very well skip most of them altogether & not miss a beat honestly. In recent years, most of the remakes cater to the teeny bopper crowd & select few deserve our attention. Zombie's take on the Carpenter classic Halloween is one of the more tolerable exercises in futility for our times.

As anyone will tell you, the future of horror films may look somewhat more positive with the strange but powerful presence of Rob Zombie standing behind a camera. His determination & sincere dedication to making great scary flicks is hopeful to say the least as no one out there wants to really scare us anymore nor craft anything that will merit a solid R-rating. God forbid you make a film which is steeped in heavy violence & gore that may warrant a very cool but undesired NC-17 rating. (Now that's what I'm talking about.) Zombie, however, is very capable of straddling the hardcore horror world while keeping the mainstream masses in check. Kudos to Zombie for sure!!

Let me begin by saying I've never been a fan of the original Halloween series per se. For some unearthly reason, I simply cannot fathom the concept of a child who is simply evil &enjoys killing for the fun of it. A great many slasher films have been made throughout the years which are nothing particularly special but yet the villains' motivation for killing is often justified in some fashion. In Carpenter's original film, we never get a clear understanding of why Michael kills which makes Halloween a cop-out in my opinion & nothing more than a springboard to deliver some cheap thrills.

Zombie does get it right & I give him props for atleast giving us a solid hour of Myer's history before releasing the slasher bloodbath with a heavy body count. Malcolm McDowell gives a bang up performance as Dr. Loomis, who tries very hard through the years to work with young Myers with no success whatsover. Rob's take on the original clearly explains much of Myer's psychological motivation which spirals into an inevitable homicidal explosion. In fact, most of the viewers are more than likely to feel sorry for the little guy this time around whereas we never really felt any sympathy in the original film nor any of the horrendous sequels.

The second half of the film is nothing more than your average chills & thrills horror flick. Zombie has a keen eye for visuals & special effects, the remainder of his film is just your typical slasher fare which is decent but don't expect anything revolutionary here. While most of the movie isn't very scary, there are some cringe-worthy moments that will more than likely satisfy genre enthusiasts everywhere or fans of the original series. I just wish Zombie had found a better actress to take on the role of Laurie Strode. I'm sorry but she will never hold a candle to the incomparable Jamie Lee Curtis. That's just small potatoes I'm sure but Scout Talor-Comption is an annoying actress or maybe her part was poorly written. Perhaps a combination of both?

This is, quite possibly, one of the better horror remakes I've seen with the exception of Aja's Hills Have Eyes. I am curious to see what Zombie does this time around with H2.",1241136000,,3542,4.678972712680578
3178890,4,B000VKL6Z2,"If you are a horror fan you will like this movie. It has all the classic horror attributes. But it also bring in the new school horror elements as well. Rob zombie tells the story in a similar manner but with twist and a deeper dive into the heart of the characters. Even to the point of making Micheal seem human and we all know he is evil incarnate!
  Is this Oscar worthy? NO! But not every movie has to be perfect some times raw and imperfect works just as well! The story is told with heart but he had to stick to the story because it was a remake/retelling so he was confined into what was!
  The kills were there the story was there and the characters were there. It smoothly transitions from young Micheal to teen Michael to Adult killer! It stays true to the story so no worries for us HALLOWEEN fans it right up our alley!
  What people need to remember is that this is just a freshening to the series not the deathnail or rebirth of the franchise! It takes what we love the Halloween series and gives it a make over!

This leads me to believe that even the director wasn't sure of the tale or that the producers weren't fond of his vision and forced re-shoots.  Sounds like a disaster in progress.

Where he humanizes a character that is scary because of how inhuman he is, it would have helped the film.  Michael is also poorly cast, he is way too huge.  It looks humorous.

Enjoyable revamp of the Halloween franchise that started with the 1978 slasher landmark from John Carpenter. Fans cried blasphemy when they heard this was gonna be remade but Rob Zombie who is a hardcore fan of the original and whom helmed the underrated ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and the brilliant ""Devil's Rejects"" went to save the franchise after it became a joke of itself no thanks to ""Halloween Resurrection"" with Busta Rhymes ruining the film. Although he had no intention to make a full remake like the horrible ""Psycho"" remake from 1998 he wanted to make a prequel and a reinvention of the original movie that honors John Carpenter's masterpiece. The film does co-star Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Brad Douriff, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Danielle Harris, Dee Wallace Stone, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, and Sybil Danning as this film does give an interesting extended history of Michael Myers and how he had a dysfunctional family. I know some fans of the original Halloween are kind of disgusted with the new Myers being a ""Married with Children"" kind of trashy family. There is some brutal gory violence making this the goriest Halloween movie since ""Halloween 2"" in 1981, though it does miss out on the original bloodless scares that made the original movie a classic this one goes for bloody action like some of the Halloween sequels. Though it is very entertaining but can never replace the original classic as that was not the intention that Rob Zombie did for he just wanted to re-establish the franchise.

3178902,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Director Rob Zombie shows us in his remake of the classic, Halloween, how to grab the money and run.

First of all, you don't want to create anything fresh or original--like the original ""Halloween, ""Alien,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" etc. You can always remake a third-rate Asian horror import because all the special effects you need are to slap white make-up on the faces of Asian kids, pile on black mascara and make them bulge their eyes and grit their teeth. Or, you can make the l5th or 20th sequel to a once brilliant original like ""Saw"". Or, you can just go back to the original classic--in this case ""Halloween""--and know that you'll be guaranteed tons of free buzz on the internet. The younger movie buffs who never saw the original will be guaranteed to fill up the seats for this much ballyhooed remake.

In this remake, Zombie has trashed everything that made the original so treasured by its fans. Instead of likeable, suburban characters, who wore attractive clothes and seemed to be fond of each other, he gives us a world of sleazy, repulsive jerks who engender no sympathy from the audience. Michael Myers, terrifying and mysterious, in the original, is now a towering, seven foot gorilla. In fact, the first hour of this travesty is spent studying the evolution of Myers from moon-faced idiot to his adult monsterhood. His step-father is a human monster, disguised as red-neck nutjob, his sister is a skanky, hard-faced idiot and his mother, a stripper, is so weak-minded in her love for her little monster, that you care nothing about their fates.

Just as bad is the casting of the youngsters. Jaime Lee Curtis was completely likable and sympathetic, as the sweet, naive young girl. Although her two girlfriends were more frisky, you still liked them, too. Also, they all wore attractive clothes. In the remake, the girls live in their boring jeans and tennis shoes and sweatshirts. They look no different from the other colorless clones you see at a mall. Show them a skirt or a dress and they'd probably scratch their heads and go, ""Duh, what's dat?""

There's a total lack of suspense as Michael Myers becomes the destroyer. You see him too much, for one thing, and his William Shatner white mask becomes boring. When he removes it, you see a good-looking young guy with stringy hair but with neatly manicured fingers. He trashes rooms and murders everyone in his path until finally, you're yawning and glancing at the clock and thinking: how much longer is going to continue. The original used a brilliant musical score, composed by the movie's director, John Carpenter. The music is an integral part to the original's greatness. It was used sparingly or brilliantly and greatly enhanced the sheer fear. In this remake, it's thrown in from the very beginning until you forget you're even listening to it.

The new Laurie spends the entire seond half of the movies shrieking non-stop, screaming and weeping and gibbering. If I was trying to escape from a killer, I think I'd be as quiet as possible and save my breath. In her boring jeans and tennis shoes and sweater and ugly glasses, she's as dull and forgettable as her mall buddies.

Equally irritating is the way the girls try to be playful and talk funny by swallowing their words and going nasal and gooching each other.  They're always trying to act scary by fluttering their fingers and disguising their voices to sound scary.

Although the original featured some nudity, Zombie wallows in it--female, that is, although you never see any male nudity. The girls are hard, snarling, tough and repellant. It's not the fault of the performers. They all try hard. It's the way they're directed that drains them of any likablity or audience identification. Even the first scene where we see Laurie and her parents over the breakfast table is ruined when Laurie makes a sexual joke using a finger and a bagel. Why? You want to slap her because she seems to think she's the cutest and sharpest girl in the world.

I remember those old, golden times in a theater where movie-makers would occasionally thrill us with brilliant, original fantasy and horror--with movies like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Thing,"" ""Alien,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" Now and then, we do get something original like ""Jeepers Creepers"".

But mostly, it's sequel after lousy sequel and worst of all, lousy remakes of golden classics. If you've never seen the original, ""Halloween,"" watch it and see why it'll be watched for decades to come--and disasters like its endless sequels and terrible remakes like this one will be relegated to the garbage dumps.",1230595200,24,4623,4.862770012706481
3178903,1,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, this film is so shallow, cliched, and tired I don't even know where to begin.  Zombie somehow manages to take a beloved classic (which was so good to begin with that it didn't ned to be remade in the first place) and destroy just about everything great about it.

Where to begin?  The dialogue is incredibly insipid, crass, and totally unbelievable.  The characters are thinner and more one-dimensional than a piece of white paper, and the motivations are absolutely straight out of a ""how to make a B-movie"" manual.  The Michael Myers backstory is so cliched that it's laughable; he comes from a seriously dysfunctional household with an abusive/alcoholic father, a stripper mother who is barely hanging on to life, and a cruel, whore sister.  Therefore, poor Michael becomes a serial killer!  Makes sense, right?  Not really...but, Zombie would like to fool people into thinking it does.

The three heroines from the original are back in the form of Anie, Linda, and of course, beloved Laurie.  Except these three girls are transformed from charming, wonderful, smart-alecky (in a cute way) girls into obnoxious, mean-spirited, vacuous, shallow twits who we can't even begin to care about.  Even Laurie herself fails to elicit much sympathy or empathy from the audience due to her being just plain stupid and rather, as I said before, obnoxious.

Loomis is transformed from a venerable, noble, and sympathetic Doctor into an egocentric, clueless, simpleton.  One can't feel any respect or identification with him either.

Finally, there's Michael himself.  In this incarnation, Michael turns from a child into a hulking behemoth...a 6 foot 8 inch bulking monster of a man.  Where's the suspense, horror, mystery, fright, or aura of terror in this idea?  I won't delve deeply into the ""what makes Michael work"" argument...but, making him 8' 9"" tall and built like a Hummer does NOT show basic comprehension for what made Michael such a legendary terror to begin with.  If bigger = scarier...why not just turn him into a 12' 8"" cyborg fashioned out of the remains of other serial killers and Nazi tanks?  Turning Myers into the Hulk doesn't make him scarier per se. In fact, it has the opposite effect because it's too obvious, lazy and cliched.  Everyone is expected to be scared of a HUGE man in a mask...but think of it this way. Real life serial killers Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy were ""normal"" guys. They appeared ""normal"" on the exterior and were also ""normal"" sized; but they were absolutely evil and some accounts also say they possessed inhuman strength. You wouldn't expect that from people who just look like they are the ""guy next door"". And THAT'S what makes them so scary. You would expect a 6'8"" hulking monster to be superhumanly strong...but you would absolutely NOT expect a man who stands just above 6 feet to be a completely indestructible force of nature. Sure, Zombie's version is more obvious...but that's also why it's so much less scary to some people. There's no mystery and no subtlety to Zombie's Myers, we expect exactly what we get. And therein lies the problem.  The original Myers had a quiet stealth and mystery to him that was truly disturbing; Nick Castle didn't simply walk while wearing the mask...he glided.  He moved smoothly and efficiently, like a shark.  And because of his ""normal"" stature, it made it even scarier when he performed superhuman feats of strength and stamina.

When I first saw the film, I wasn't sure whether or not to blame most of my dislikes on the actors...but then I realized, they were doing their best given the material they had to work with.  The fault lies with the director/writer for even putting such trash to paper in the first place.

Naturally, when this film was announced and the director revealed, audiences shouldn't have expected a shot-for-shot remake of the original.  But, audiences WERE expecting a film with intelligence, style, and a basic comprehension and respect for what made ""Halloween"" work in the first place. Zombie showed NONE of those things.  Instead he caters to the average IQ level of the reality-TV-slurping cro-magnons who have the attention span and aesthetic sensibility of a pre-schooler.  He took a great idea, a masterpiece of horror and dumbed it down...stripped it of it's mystery and subtlety, and thus its effectiveness...and layered it with white-trash characters, foul-mouthed and crass teens that are unlikeable, and poured buckets of blood on it; he made it more ""today"". That's NOT necessarily a good thing.",1229385600,39,4539,4.974834437086093
3178904,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Halloween (2007) Initially I was very disappointed to hear that the next movie from the Halloween franchise would be yet another ""reboot,"" or ""reimagining"" of the original movie rather than another sequel. I'm torn on this trend of remaking the classic horror films of my youth, initially finding most unnecessary. But at the same time, I came to realize that a set of British remakes of the Universal Studios Monsters movies of the 30's resulted in the Hammer Horror series nearly thirty years later, so there is some precedent of quality and worth. At the same time, I'm also one of the few people who will cut an eighth horror sequel some slack. Later I was a tiny bit less disappointed to hear that Rob Zombie had been chosen to write and direct the reboot as I have enjoyed his other movies to varying extents. Zombie's Halloween grounds Michael Myers in a horrible white trash upbringing, spending the first fifty minutes detailing why he descends into madness and murder. Part of that extra time is spent in Smith's Grove, giving more screen time to Dr. Loomis, now played by Malcolm McDowell. After that the story basically follows Carpenter's original with the almost feminine looking and tiny ten year old somehow growing to be 6'5'' Tyler Mane on institution food and becoming kind of a Terminator, bashing through walls to grab his victims instead of silently popping out at them from the dark. He pursues Laurie, Annie, and Linda through their worst October 31st ever, but also grabs several other victims every chance he gets, tripling the body count of the original Halloween. The supernatural dread Michael Myers originally had is muted by his grounded in reality origin all the way through the new movie's finale, a far cry from the sick fear you felt when Michael's body was no longer lying on the ground in front of the Wallace home. Weirdly, although I find this more realistic origin undermining to Michael Myer's ability to be fearsome, I find the movie's first 50 minutes more entertaining than the last hour, though the greasy long hair on everybody started to be annoying eventually. In fact, during the final chase between Michael and Laurie I grew bored, ready for the movie to just wrap it up. Overall, it is kinda fun to see how Zombie populates nearly every adult speaking part with a familiar genre face, but even that starts to grate when a lot of them are only on screen for a few seconds or don't even speak. As far as the negatives go, I dislike almost every bit of casting Zombie did on the younger cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis was so good as Laurie in 1978, and this new actress pales so far in comparison. Her Laurie is actually unlikable, and most of the time I couldn't even tell her and Linda apart even with the glasses shtick. The only bright spot among the younger cast is Danielle Harris as Annie. Harris, a vet of Halloweens 4 and 5 is a bright spot here and completely pulls off being a high schooler even though the actress was around 30 at the time of the production. I was a little sad to see her do a nude scene this far into her career though. McDowell is probably the best choice you could make to play Loomis, but it was a mistake for him to avoid watching the original, because he never takes the character as far out as Donald Pleasance did which is who Loomis is. And it's not as if McDowell isn't capable of scenery chewing when he chooses. So, to put the final nail in this one, though there is a level of quality to this production and a few positive moments here and there, this remake is one of those unnecessary ones I mentioned.",1229212800,3,3629,4.584615384615384

3178906,5,B000VKL6Z2,"When you're doing a remake of a movie that was done right the first time, you have to differentiate it, take the same premise and go down some different paths than the first one took.  The 2007 Halloween remake does this, and it helps make it one of the best horror remakes ever done.

  The most obvious deviation from the original line of films is that Michael Myers now has an origin.  A large part of what made the original work was the very lack of a reason behind the character's malevolence: Michael was a perfectly normal little kid who, for no discernible reason, picks up a kitchen knife one October 31 and butchers his sister, beginning a years-long cycle as a mute, endlessly killing, boogeyman.  This time there's nothing normal about Michael to begin with.  He was born with psychotic tendencies and then grew up in an envirornment of abuse and torment; either of these factors - the nature or the nurture - could have resulted in a murderer, but coming together they create what Sam Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell in the role Donald Pleasance originally made famous) calls a 'perfect storm', that creates the monsterous killing machine Myers becomes.  It was a big risk to change the core of the character from an eerily blank slate to the more human monster we have in this version, but it worked great, and Myers (played by Tyler Mane as an adult and Daeg Faerch as a ten year-old) is menacing enough to leave just that little glimmer that Maybe there's even more at play behind that white mask than the aforementioned factors.

  The other big change is the time frame.  The 1978 original opens with Myers as a child but that takes up only a few minutes - 95% of the movie occurs on the Halloween day and night fifteen years later when Michael returns to his hometown of Haddonfield.  Here, the movie starts some time before the night Michael becomes a killer and continues through the years that follow, including his incarceration at a mental hospital and his eventual, devastating escape and return to Haddonfield.  We see the evolution of the monster in full, and by the time he's back home on Halloween night Myers is a tremendous, truly frightening force.

  Everything from the acting to the direction and the special effects, musical score, etc. is extremely high caliber and in addition to being scary and, at times, surprisingly moving, it's also one of the sexiest horror movies out there thanks to a cast of great looking actresses including Danielle Harris, Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Hanna Hall and Sheri Moon Zombie.  Also of interest on the acting front are appearances by Bill Mosely and Danny Trejo (both from director Rob Zombie's Firefly films - ""The House Of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky from the ""Child's Play"" movies).  Effective use of music and a number of hugely memorable visual images are also worth noting.

  The 2007 Halloween doesn't take the place of the original series, nor does it set out to; it extablishes itself as a great, Different take on the original concept and characters, and manages to match anything from the original series.  A horror essential.",1228176000,,3177,4.778388278388278
3178907,5,B000VKL6Z2,Ok I was not around when the original Halloween was released but watched it many many times over the course of my child hood and love it to this day. When Rob Zombie said he was remaking it I flipped becuase I am a huge fan of his since White Zombie and loved all his other movies. This movie not only did John Carpenters justice I think Zombie actually out did it. I try to see as many of the horror remakes I can because I am a big fan of Horror classics and the genre in general. Most of the remakes have been lame or over gorified. This one is by far the best remake I have ever seen and still managed to creep me out when I saw it in theaters. There are only a few remakes I would consider good but this one was Amazing. For any fan of horror movies in general this is a must have.,1227830400,,786,3.888198757763975

I must say i was greatly disappointed & lost almost all hope for an awesome movie when i heard tons of people from his other films inclueding his wife were in this film to i thought oh it's the same damn thing he's goin to ruin it. but i ended up goin on opening night out of being curious & loved it, his wife did a pretty good job to if you ask me. showed more acting skills than she did in the other 2 films i must say. although i still love the first i don't think you should compar them but more as look as them as a different veiw & i love rob's veiw of this film as well as the original",1227657600,,766,3.79375
3178909,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I have to say, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to films, especially horror films. I cannot say that I've ever sat through a film that literally made my head want to explode from severe pain. This is until I sat through Rob Zombie's Halloween.

I swear, I wanted to shut it off after the first ten minutes. What made me watch it all the way through.. I don't know. Chalk it up to too much curiosity, I guess. It was mind numbing! The dialog.. The acting.. The story.. I was shaking my head in disbelief. I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. Like some surreal nightmare. The worst pile of garbage ever to hit celluloid.

And this is coming from a big fan of Rob Zombie. I practically considered him my creative idol for a while. Man, what the hell was I thinking?! Mr. Zombie claimed he wanted to bring back Michael Myers to true form and make him terrifying again. He did the EXACT opposite. He made Michael into a JOKE! A walking, talking cliche. Laughable. Not scary or even remotely terrifying. Just one big joke!

And this all for a three picture deal. That was Zombie's only reason for remaking Halloween. To further his film making career, which should be laid to rest. I've lost so much respect for Rob, it's not even funny. As far as I'm concerned, he spit in John Carpenter's face with this failed attempt of a remake.

Bottom line.. You have to be completely brain dead to enjoy this movie. I'm sorry for be insulting but I can't for the life of me imagine how anyone could've possibly enjoyed this movie. It is utter trash. From beginning to end if you can make it that far without your brain completely shutting down.

Worst film ever made. PERIOD! Negative 5 stars.

3178912,3,B000VKL6Z2,"While I was watching Rob Zombie's new ""Halloween,"" I was truly amazed by two things: its length and violence. Having seen his films ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects,"" I knew what I was going to see in this revamped version, but I never expected he would spend so much time (more than 30 minutes) to show Michael Myers as a 10-year-old bullied boy (played by Daeg Faerch, who is certainly convincing).

I will not write here the details of his family; I only say it is not very pleasant to see, but maybe that is the point. Maybe Rob Zombie is just trying to give Michael a social background, something few people care. I am afraid it only deprives this horror icon of its superhuman presence. Tyler Mane did a very good job as grown-up Michael Myers, but the long introductory part that tried to (sort of) explain him has made the new ""Halloween"" just another serial killer movie.

And this film is very gory. It also has nudities (more than once). Not that I am complaining. Screaming Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is again chased by Michael Myers, and to his credit Rob Zombie has made each sequence competently, but that is all. What is shown here looks clichd, familiar to those who have seen other slasher films, except the unique cast including William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Richard Lynch, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig and Sybil Danning. Blink your eyes and you will miss Udo Kier and Clint Howard. (And ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz? Where was he?)

I have watched the original ""Halloween"" long time ago, but I still remember some of the film's scenes were really creepy. But they were not about Michael Myers as killing machine murdering his victims; they were about Michael Myers just standing in the street as if he is something supernatural coming from another world. From the strictly technical viewpoint, Rob Zombie's re-imagined version is decent. It is only that John Carpenter's vision is replaced by Zombie's relentless descriptions of violence, which was seen in his previous films. It was about time to move on.",1226102400,2,2068,4.803370786516854
3178913,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Way better than the original Halloween.
This version completes the story, explain why many stuff are there and on that way. I liked it very much. Instead, the original 1978 version lacks something.",1225929600,,197,5.0
3178914,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I won't go into a long review about the film, save to say it's not a great one, but I didn't find it extremely horrible either. It's a Rob Zombie movie in all respects (if I want to see Carpenter I'll watch the original, it's as simple as that), but it's never nearly as great as his previous film, The Devil's Rejects. It stays in apathy, just like the main character. A two hour biopic about a psychopath is hardly meant to be about cheers, but neither does this deliver on its scares. It's decent. I'd rate the unrated cut of the film 5 out of 10.

This edition is everything you could want out of the film and beyond. If you enjoyed it, or the absolutely excellent R2 DVD for The Devil's Rejects, this is perfect for you. There are all the briefer featurette segments from the previous DVD, which are enjoyable enough (the bloopers don't leave me in stitches, but they're somewhat funny), and there's also every screen test known to man (Rob must love to watch these early and stark readings for whatever reason). As just two discs, it's a somewhat decent special edition, putting into account that the film is unrated with eleven more minutes, and that Rob has a commentary on the entire film and all the deleted scenes. And speaking of those, they're actually pretty good, at least interesting to watch. There are a lot of moments there that the film could've used, but it's too bad there was nothing more with the female trio of the film, perhaps exactly all their scenes were used.

Then there's the third disc, with the most exhaustive (length-wise) documentary I've ever seen: ""Michael Lives: The Making of Halloween"". This four and a half hour-long documentary follows the entire pre-production and principal photography process in a rapid fire, day to day event style, including interview segments from Rob and his cast and crew. It shows you everything you could ever want to see about ""how it went down"", but I think it's too bad that there is almost nothing at all on post-production, even if that would've made this mammoth over five hours long. Less Rob wanting to dirty up sets, and more of editing, sound, music, promotion, premiere! Most of the entire thing is also ""coincidental"" camera, we're usually not given any specific context (which is sort of explained in the end credits, with a fun and quick segment of people wanting to continually kill or get rid of the cameraman shooting the documentary). Even if it's more about ""watching when Halloween was made"" than as detailed as Peter Jackson's great ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder: The Making of King Kong"", it's a very good documentary, and it will require more than a casual fan, a completely free afternoon and several cups of coffee or other stimulants to be watched.

With Halloween, Rob has done a pretty good job, but has overall delivered a lot more quantity than quality. It is appreciated though, because it's certainly better than the usual five-minute a**kisser segments that pass as special features these days.

Oh, and a small plus for the neat slipcase.",1225843200,2,3043,4.725047080979285
3178915,1,B000VKL6Z2,"First off I wish to say that I enjoyed Rob Zombie's other two films and that this review will contain spoilers for anyone who has not seen the other films in the HALLOWEEN series.

When I first heard about this movie I was extordinarly excited. I'm a HUGE fan of the HALLOWEEN series. I own all the movies ((except this one)) I even own Halloween 3 *which in case you didn't know, has NOTHING to do with Micheal*. So I started watching the movie and felt like i was going to scream, in a bad way. Here are a list of things Mr. Zombie did so horribly wrong.

1. Micheal killed ONLY his sister first
2. His parents were very normal loving people
3. Mr. Zombie tried to give Micheal a reason when HALLOWEEN 6 already did that
4. Is it just me or did this feel like and excuss for a little T & A
5. WAY to violent, yeah I know its horror, but the original one isn't like that
6. What is up with the ""lumbering bohemeth"" Micheal, I'm sorry but I'm more afraid of the little man that is strong enough to stick me three feet off the floor into a door with a kitchen knife
7. When did Mr. Zombie think it was a good idea to make Laurie a complete B***H!
8.((more something im disappointed in))Danielle Harris, love her as Jamie in HALLOWEEN 4 & 5, but as Annie...WTH?! It's like her acting ability just vanished.
9. Dr. Loomis...Okay I love Mr. McDowell and I actually liked him as Loomis, but Loomis is not that brave at first, he is actually afraid of Micheal in a way.
10. The ending, wow...it was just as much of a let down as the rest of the movie if not MORE.

okay there's my list, I'm sure there are a few things I forgot, but I think you get the point. I would also like to add that I do enjoy a GOOD remake (e.x. When A Stranger Calls) when they don't mess with the formula of the original to much. Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN not only didn't follow the formula but almost destroyed a true classic. I would suggest to any teenagers ((or anyone really)) reading this ((im 24 fyi)) to watch the ENTIRE series and don't even bother with this. John Carpenter's version ALL THE WAY!!",1225670400,14,2075,4.1825
3178916,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Many can understand the disappointment a remake can bring, but viewing it in a different perspective really helps. Nine times out of ten a remake fails to restore the magic the original held so high. Even with a large budget, powerful cultish fanbase, and inspired crew some movies just fail to deliver. Here we are with Halloween, a classic slasher from the late 70's. Holding key elements many slashers would religiously follow in the near future, Halloween spawned many seqauls but non seemed to really live up all as well. Also note Halloween (the original) was filmed with a measly budget.

Excessive gore, nudity, and screams dust off any filler most halloween films hold. Which is not positive thing, the frugal use of these really aided more in the dynamic swift kills the original held high. Instead of tension and release we get a snapshot of the masked maniacs childhood. With a rather long segment devoted to the development of a psychotic youths background, we are then bombarded with a short clean of suspense gore fest. It summarizes the original films story so fast and inorganically it almost feels like two films brought together.

If I sound critical, the positive begins here. I really enjoyed the revamped music, the shaky camera views, and the few twists on things. The very way Micheal's grimacing stares penetrate the hope in the victims, in my opinion, shows how terrifying deranged he's become. Standing taller then most combined with his physical strength well beyond normal human exertion he is quite the killer. This is a man who has remained mute for years, losing all sense of moral, filled with rage from childhood issues with a unthoroughly psychopathic nature. Never would he admit to his wrong doings. His blood lust slaying ways are basically encrypted as second nature by the half mark of the film. Gone is the child he once was.

So really the film kaputs the mysterious entity many liked. In return we get a more indepth view. Although not as good as the original and lacking many of the qualities, it still isn't a bad movie. With a few nods here and there to the old film, some might enjoy it, but many may not like the forced feeling. So it boils down to a entertaining, intensified, slasher ride. Many won't go for this as Rob Zombie has tarnished his name in the film industry ( I personally disagree), you be the judge and rent it.",1225411200,2,2376,4.734299516908212
3178917,2,B000VKL6Z2,"What a major disappointment this film is coming after the Devil's Rejects. I thought Zombie's directorial debut House of a 1,000 Corpses was too gross and graphic, which is exactly how I feel about this film, whereas the Devil's Rejects was so stylish and well told that you actually cared about the characters. This is just a pointless remake of one of the best horror films of all time. Zombie's intentions with this film were to tell the back story of Michael Myers and offer an explanation for why he was a ruthless psychotic killer. Did we really need an explanation? Isn't it better without? The problem is that the background info is so stereotypical. Mike's mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper. Her drunk boyfriend (William Forsythe) is a homophobe who teases Michael mercilessly. His sister thinks he is weird and for good reason since she walks in on him torturing and killing an animal while wearing a weird mask that he made. At school he is the target of bullies who make sexual comments about his mom and then beat him up. The principal does nothing since he doesn't like him either. The only person in his life who doesn't hate him despite his mother is his baby sister who is too young to have an opinion. Come Halloween night his mom is at work, his sister is upstairs having sex, and the boyfriend is passed out on the couch leaving Michael all alone with no one to take him trick or treating. He decides to go into the house, grab a knife and kill everyone save for his baby sister. When mom comes home she finds him calmly sitting on the steps holding the baby. He is arrested and institutionalized where a fame seeking doctor named Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) tries to analyze him and figure out why he did what he did. Michael isn't talking and doesn't for years prompting both Loomis and Michael's mother to give up on him. Fifteen years later Michael stages a violent escape from the institution and goes back to his hometown. Like in the original film we now meet Laurie (Scout Taylor Compton) and her fellow babysitting friends who are discussing their Halloween night plans. The other girls save for Laurie will be with their boyfriends while Laurie will be babysitting the neighbor's kids. By the end of the night Laurie will come face to face with pure evil as Dr. Loomis describes Michael. The doctor will team up with the sheriff (Brad Dourif) to try and stop Michael before he can carry out his mysterious mission. This is the only thing that makes this film different is the back story provided and it finally gives a reason for why Michael is seeking Laurie but those reasons alone don't make it a good film. It is graphically violent like Corpses was and lacks any of the style or wit of Devil's Rejects despite retaining half of that cast. The acting is pretty bad save for McDowell who gives a really good performance which isn't saying much after you see what a ham he is on the gag reel. There are tons of extras on the two disc set but they don't disguise how disappointing and unnecessary this film was. A major step backwards for Zombie as a director.",1225411200,4,3093,4.55475763016158
3178918,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Like many others have already said, this is a different perspective on the same story. I am a huge fan of Halloween, but was open to seeing how it can be retold. One aspect of this version I thoroughly enjoyed was the exploration of Michael's childhood. This was a point of controversy, as it humanizes and in a sense psychologically tries to explain Michael as a character. I felt it really was more social commentary since I don't think it was about explaining who he is, as much as a commentary on how we try to rationalize these kinds of behaviors as a society.

Again, this movie is very different, and everyone should at least take comfort that even if you don't like it, the original will always be there. I felt this was a fantastic re-telling or as it is called ""re-imagining"". Besides, I really felt this movie was a lot better than a lot of the follow up sequels that came after the original Halloween and Halloween 2.",1225411200,,929,4.464705882352941
3178919,5,B000VKL6Z2,"So, I won't start a debate on whether or not you like this film, as compared to the original, since the truth is---they are two different walks of life.

I love Zombie's remake. Does it hold a candle to the original? The point of Zombie's film is to recreate Halloween, not duplicate.

With that said, I've been a fan of the series since age 8. Now, 25 years later, with technology improving the way we watch these movies, I must say Zombie's Halloween on Blu-ray is more than worth the purchase.

The sound is incredible, for you home theater geeks out there. And the HD transfer is crystal.

As for the bonus features, what a treat to see a day by day behind the scenes documentary that made this film. The second blu-ray disc has a chapter menu that lets you watch the filming of this movie in 5 day shooting spurts, each section anywhere from 25-40 min long. 40-some days in total, and it's like being on the set and going through the ups and downs, the laughs, seeing the cast as family, and getting a window into how Zombie is a great horror director with vision, and a great relationship with his cast. And seeing how the cast brought this movie together. Die-hards like myself will love this--to the casual fan, maybe not.

This is one hell of a packed Blu-ray.",1225238400,3,1269,4.429184549356223
3178920,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The #1 ""Helpful Review"" on this site ridiculously gives this movie 1 star.  How on EARTH is this a 1-star movie?  I thought it was brilliantly done.  Going back and showing Michael Myers' progression into becoming a serial killer was not only a very smart movie, but it was pulled off extremely well.  Of course, a lot of the movie was predictable, especially after Michael became an adult, but that's what you expect from Halloween movies.

Nearly half of the movie is Michael as a child; finally reaching his breaking point after being bullied at school, and killing his first victim, then his entire family (except his sister, who we all know was Jamie Lee Curtis in all of the other Halloween movies).  I can't believe that I'm reading negative reviews about this portion of the movie.  It was brilliant in every regard.

Michael wasn't ""less scary"" because they showed a human side of him.  It probably made him MORE scary, because he was an absolute nut job.  He just flat out stopped talking one day, and never spoke another word ever again.  He was deranged, yet extremely intelligent, calculated, and precise.  A world class serial killer.  Showing his background added to the series, and made me appreciate the other Halloween movies even more, now that you got a look at a background story.

GREAT movie, and I highly recommend it.  4.5 stars.",1224892800,3,1354,4.75107296137339

3178922,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Sorry Zombie-philes. I like some of the guy's music, but he's a complete waste of celluloid as a director. Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' was the worst film of last year and one of the worst ever made. I'm not completely against remakes whatsoever. Films like 'The Fly', 'The Thing', 'The Blob', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' were all fantastic second-takes on classic movies. Admittedly, besides 'Dawn' I don't think I've seen a good remake in the past 5 years.

I was hopeful for Zombie's reinvention of Michael Myers. I will never fault someone for taking a franchise that pretty much crapped the bed, and trying to make it scary again. After 'H20' and the putrid 'Resurrection' I would have paid to see Michael in a college road trip flick for the possibility of an intentional laugh. Zombie instead took the reigns and delivered what I believe to be the worst 'Halloween' film in the entire series--and I have some hardcore hate for 'Revenge', 'H20' and 'Resurrection'.

This film fails in the first five minutes. The director can't stay away from white-trash characters filling his scenes with hilariously ridiculous dialogue. The fact that we're to follow Michael Myers from his awkward tween years on up is such a horrible misstep. We don't want to know what Michael Myers looks like in the principal's office. John Carpenter showed us a kid in a clown suit with a giant, bloody carving knife--and that was all we needed. It's scarier when we aren't held by the hand and shown exactly why a guy decides to put on a mask and kill people. All Rob had to do was tell a new story in Haddonfield and it would have sufficed. Instead we're subjected to countless poorly directed scenes with despicable characters you don't care about spouting high school-esque dialogue before being stabbed. It's pathetic filmmaking, and it's laughable that anyone involved in this honeybucket of a movie would try to justify its existence.

It's sad if the new generation of horror fans embrace drivel like this. Do yourselves a favor and buy Carpenter's masterful original. If you've already seen this then I hope you're one day able to burn it from your memory... I know I haven't been able to yet.",1224720000,6,2220,4.806282722513089
3178923,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I saw Halloween when it was release in Theaters and I loved the film. So when it came out on DVD, I went out and bought the Director's Cut to see what was added. I discovered that one of my favorite scenes was replaced! In the theatrical release, Micheal escaping from the guards was just a fun scene, but Rob Zombie felt 'it wasn't real enough,' so he replaced it with a rape scene.

So, Micheal breaking lose and killing a handful of guards, or two guys break into Micheal's cell to rape a girl (WTF) and Micheal just walks out (and kills the two guys). The director's cut also including pointless things like fading to black and it reading ""Halloween night."" Zombie must think his fans are retarded that we couldn't figure that out.

If you watch the director's cut and hated the movie, I don't blame you. But give the film another try and watch the theatrical release, it's way better. It's amazing, ask anyone who saw it in theaters.

3178924,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I am not going to over exaggerate in this review like most do with this film. Let's get one thing straight, remakes will never be better than the original. You will never again experience a remake the same way you experienced the original because it isn't fresh anymore. You knows whats going to happen, and most of the time nothing is changed. A film should never be called a remake unless it truly is a remake, a new vision, something not entirely like the original. Pay homages to the original, but never do it scene for scene, or shot for shot, like Gus Van Sants Psycho. Make it your own, and a true remake. Build up upon what was already great.

With a film as fantastic as Halloween, its very hard to do a remake of it because it did everything right. It had absolutely no blood, only a creepy atmosphere and suspense throughout. How do you remake a film like Halloween? You make it your own and show another vision for today's generation.

Rob Zombie did just this, while paying homage to the original. While the film may contain the same characters and certain scenes, they are no way in hell done the way they were done in the original. Zombie takes a more modern approach, understanding how most girls today talk (Yes, they can be this bad-mouthed in the real world, dare I say worse) and knowing today that almost all horror films are filled with blood and gore. I am not for blood and gore, but I have learned to accept that it is present in all Rated R horror films today.

The worst part of the film is the explanation for why Michael is the way he is. It's just weak scripting, and he turns evil in a flash. It sort of reminded me of how quick Anakin turned to the dark side in Star Wars Episode 3, its that quick, but it doesn't bother you once he begins to kill those in the household with the new version of Carpenters theme playing in the background.

The acting is great all around, but there are two lines in the film that are horribly delivered, and they are both within 10 seconds.

""Was that the bogeyman?""

""As a matter of fact, I do believe it was.""

Can you even use the words ""As a matter of fact"" and ""I do believe"" in the same sentence? Moving on.

I am shocked to see that this film has a 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, because the film isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. When you put it side-by-side with other remakes, you could certainly do a helluva lot worse. Just take the film as another vision of John Carpenters horror classic, unlike most did, and you should appreciate what you are given here.

PQ: Fantastic. This is new demo material. The constant zoom-ins in the film show a great amount of detail, and the black levels are great.

AQ: One of the better TrueHD soundtracks to come from the Weinsteins. The scene when Michael is stabbing at the ceiling will push your system.

Supplements: All of the supplements from the previous DVD are on one disk, with another disk containing the documentary. Most of them are fairly interesting. I haven't got to the documentary yet.

The blu-ray: 5/5",1224633600,3,3061,4.386925795053004
3178925,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm a huge fan of Rob's work both with his music and previous films.  I was excited to say the least when I first heard he'd direct a Halloween remake and eagerly awaited the film to hit theatres.  I just remember sitting through the movie with my girlfriend being incredibly bored and in awe at how bad this movie was.  It just was not scary what so ever. I so wanted to like to the movie, that even half way through I was telling myself it will get better. I was really dissapointed and it really bumped down Rob's skills as a film maker in my book.",1224460800,3,551,4.130841121495327
3178926,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Upon the anticipation of one of my favorite holidays, I felt it was necessary, if not crucial to dabble in some suspenseful and horrifying cinema this week. The suspense, or lack thereof, mostly resulted into a depressing and horrific cinematic experience. It was so horrifying to see a remake fail in all aspects, visually and cinematically that I could almost hear John Carpenter's hair turn whiter as he chain-smokes his last and final cigarette.

The truth is I happen to be a fan of Rob Zombie's previous films; moreover, I appreciated his passion for cult horror movies that sometimes incorporated the sort of nostalgic drive-in movie era. Upon hearing a remake of Carpenter's classic, I became annoyed and disappointed at first, but was soon relieved to find out it was someone not only worthy of creativity but truly passionate about these type of slasher films that Zombie cares about so much. Boy, was I profoundly disappointed in Zombie's ""re-imaging"" of Halloween, or shall I call it a sheer massacre.

For the first 45-50 minutes of the film, We get a lengthy and interminable back round of Michael's Myer's psychology; the rationale; he comes from a broken home with a mother who strips late night to make ends meet, a dead-beat father figure who incessantly call his boy, ""faget"", and an uncaring older sister who is about as uninteresting as the film. At school, it is no different as Michael endures a myriad of tortures from school bullies who appear about as non-threatening as a senile old lady. The young boy playing Michael Myer's childhood was disturbing in the sense that he was scarier looking without the mask as his girlish blonde hair, pre-adolescent chubby face and crooked teeth rendered him retarded looking. The bottom line is that Rob Zombie's approach into making Michael Myer's character more sympathetic to the audience truly defies John Carpenter's intentions. I honestly loathed the weak climatic build up of Michael Myer's mental breakdown if you could call it that; personally it looked like a rebellious pre-pubescent hissy fit. It was a tough pill to swallow to take Myer's childhood seriously and even more so when he's battering his sister's boyfriend brains with a baseball bat, or slitting William Forsythe's throat. Even Malcolm Mcdowell's psychological evaluation of Michael Myer's meltdown in the mental institution came off as incredibly corny adding entirely no substance to the film; it was uninformative and just plain boring. I just hope they paid Mcdowell a pretty penny to waste his valuable acting skills on this film, but that is beside the point.

After the long introduction horror fans of the genre finally get to see the true modern Michael Myer's we've been waiting for, the result, a 280 lb. 6'8 gorilla. Hey who would of thought Michael Meyer's physique would mimic an NFL coaches wet dream. This is another problem I had with this film, Rob Zombie thought it was necessary to seriously upgrade Myer's physique, bad idea... what were they feeding this kid at the mental institution, HGH and testosterone! His figure looks overbearing in the film to the point where his on-screen presence looks inhuman and far too dominating as his broad shoulders and towering height look more like a Caterpillar bulldozer at a construction site. In all seriousness, I had difficulty deciphering whether Myer's was suffering from middle-child syndrome or exhibiting symptoms of roid rage, which is probably the only mysterious enigma about Myer's Psychology in the entire film. Personally, I thought what made Carpenter's Myer's more frightening is that he appeared more average and less animated. It was his slow but persevering amble that gave me the chills, not a fast over dominating beast that broke through every door and main beam in that house. It was ridiculous and nauseating to witness Zombie's over extended chase scenes that really amounted to sheer emptiness and dissatisfaction in the end. In other words, the pay-off sucked big time. The editing overall was pretty weak as well, a few interesting wide-angle shots in the mental institution accompanied by more mundane uninteresting chase scenes. Rob Zombie also upgrades the violence as well but it fails miserably to compensate for the lack of suspense. As a result, the violence comes off as incredibly gratuitous and unwarranted. However, I cannot bash the nudity even though it delivered the same unjustified result as the violence. It was almost as if Robb Zombie was forcing the nudity as if saying, ""I can show bush in my Halloween and get away with it"".

Despite my criticism, there are some few and sparse redeeming qualities such as the authenticity of recapturing the 1970's feel which Rob Zombie subtlety recaptures and manages to weave into the film. Sheri Moon Zombie actually pulls it off kind of nicely, maybe it was her carefully selected wardrobe or her soft dirty blonde hair, couldn't tell you but her looks worked for the time being. Her acting is another story, I won't go there, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say its serviceable at best. Rob Zombie throws in some 70's one hit wonders, some Blue oyster Cult, which is also featured in Carpenter's version when Jamie Lee Curtis is driving with PJ Soles, Rush and Nazareth. The only interesting relationship I found was that between Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers in the mental institution and Sid Haig's quick cameo, other than that the character development was extremely weak leaving me disconnected from relating to anybody.
 I did get through most of the bonus features and even some of that 4  hour documentary. There are some interesting bonus features, just about enough to last you through next Halloween. Horror Fans will enjoy the 2nd disc with interviews and behind the scenes, along with a 3rd disc step by step ""making of documentary of the entire movie. Despite Rob Zombie's catastrophic reimaging of a Horror classic, I have to applaud his audaciousness for actually exposing how he screwed up a classic in the infamous 4  documentary. But seriously, it is interesting to see how a film is made and how frustrating it is to meet deadlines, deal with actors, prop sets you name it. There is a great deal patience and articulation in respect to guiding your actors, script and photography.  The film is certainly not a good remake, more like horrendous but the bonus features can keep you occupied for a bit if your interested in making films.",1224374400,4,6458,4.973148148148148

3178929,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Watching Rob Zombie's Halloween was a pretty interesting experience. When I rented it, I was pretty sure it would suck, as all remakes invariably do. Then I started watching it. I started to get mad, thinking ""this movie is lame"" because it is a COMPLETELY different take on the classic Halloween storyline. Its so different its almost a completely separate movie. I realized I was getting angry because Rob's movie wasn't following the original. What a silly thing! To want a cookie-cutter REMAKE when Rob's movie was a clever and successful 'reimagining'.
  Don't watch this movie expecting Halloween. Watch it as a stand-alone movie, and you will appreciate what a good job Rob Zombie did at what seemed to be an impossible task (equalling the original). The movie does take quite a while to really get rolling, so stick with it. Once the good stuff arrives (and you all know what that means) there are some truly frightening and suspenseful scenes (and better than the original!). While I would still rate the original Halloween higher than Rob Zombie's version, I must say I was impressed with his fresh take on the story, and his excellent handling of the scary scenes.

3178930,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Since so many people have railed on Zombie's Halloween for the same reasoning -- with a backstory, Michael is less scary -- I wanted to present an alternate opinion. Looking at it entirely from the perspective of the remake and trying to put Carpenter's admittedly classic original out of my head, I thought the backstory was fascinating, I also thought the first 40 minutes or so were the best part of Zombie's reimagining, and when Michael was breaking out of the compound to go on his signature rampage, I was particularly happy with the film (Michael's relationship with Danny Trejo is one of the best elements of the film).

However, when the focus turns to Haddonfield, the film turns to s---. Zombie has cast, or written -- in the case of the main character, I'm not really sure -- the three most annoying girls in the history of cinema. Every line out of their mouths made my head ache and I longed for the characters from the original movie. Even Danielle Harris, who was fairly charming in Halloween 4 and 5, is as shrill and grating as the other two. The only advantage to Zombie's movie in this aspect is that since it spends so much time with Michael as a boy, this section of the movie is naturally sped up. After Michael had dispatched a couple of them the movie started to get back on track, but had this section resembled Carpenter's more closely, I might have just turned the movie off.

Regardless, I thought Halloween 07 was interesting. For all the horrible, uninspiring, Xerox-level remakes out there (like, for instance, the shot-for-shot remake Quarantine, which at every opportunity has spoiled the original, [REC] for me), at least Zombie made a film that is unquestionably his, containing hallmarks and themes from the original, but is a distinctly different film.",1223769600,4,1791,4.774193548387097
3178931,1,B000VKL6Z2,"95% of remakes have no reason to exist - And only work in the hands of genius filmmakers.  I believe that Rob Zombie has talent, but his sensibilities are Tobe Hooper/Geek Show attraction.  This is perfect for House of 1,000 Corpses or Devil's Rejects but doesn't lend itself to Halloween at all.  John Carpenter grew up on Howard Hawks (which shows in Assault on Precinct 13) and JC's remakes of Howard Hawks production, The Thing.  Rob Zombie may've been impacted by Halloween but doesn't understand it the way John Carpenter understood The Thing.  That's the problem.

Though some remakes are valid - the trouble of a remake is: Good or Bad - it erases the original film from public memory.  This is a problem, especially in horror because the next generation of horror fans will grow up without knowledge and respect for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and soon - A Nightmare on Elm St.

In he 2007 Halloween, nearly an hour is wasted on Michael's Trashy upbringing in one of the most pointless origin stories ever put on screen since The Grinch.  What made John Carpenter's Halloween so scary is that Michael can't be expalined - he had a good family.  His evil is a mystery which is what makes him fascinating.  Rob Zombie's may be true to life but it's boring as hell.

Then the last 40 minutes is a sped up re-make of the original.  We don't get any time to know the kids and none of them are even remotely interesting.  As a fan of Zombie's first two films - I anticipated this one, knowing he was wrong for it, but hoping he'd pull it off and make something interesting.

I was wrong, both he and Neil Marshal (with Doomsday) neutralized the impact of their last two fascinating films.  The Descent and Devil's Rejects were refreshing detours from the stupid Saw and Eli Roth films.  These haven't been easy years for horror fans and this film is yet another major setback.",1223769600,5,1900,4.607142857142857
3178932,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of The Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, and now Halloween. All originals were independent productions made with limited budgets that found worldwide success due to the fact they were simply well made original films. Leave it to Hollywood to do some sloppy cut n paste jobs with some hack/poser directors cashing in hard earned name recognition, basically they see something so old making more money consistently over the years when their modern dull horror flicks fail to be remembered once they're out of theaters so they create some mock-ups with the same name and cut in front of line. All these new horror remakes are BORING to their very core, the violence isn't even ""XTREEEME"" as they try to make it out to be, even if there is more blood than the originals (well Dawn of The Dead remake was no where near as graphic as the original on top of being moronic/annoying).
  Well here's Rob Zombie's Halloween. Rob Zombie is a terrible writer and a lousy director, he belongs directing Saw movies or some straight to DVD horror flicks, this is easily the worst horror remake since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it might be even worse than that one. The film has vague character outlines but nothing much else, and don't say it doesn't matter because a good hour of this movie is devoted to fall-flat-on-its-face character development that is nonexistent. There is setup, location, some empty lines, and well its so amateurish, either the door is wide open for some real talent to save horror or it really is over for the genre.
  The payoff at the end of the film is very cut n paste. Its no better or worse than any Halloween sequel, well its not even as good as 2 or 4. Since its a new movie the camera is constantly shaking around and there's that fake ""realistic"" brutality/dying/screaming acting that is so forced its just annoying. There is nothing worse in my opinion than something that believes it is truly shocking and in your face when in truth it is very plain and kind of dull. Every minute of this movie is like that down to the throwaway horror cameo characters, which are haphazard cussfests that attempt to be funny but are just, I dunno, lame. Zombie's downtrodden ""everyone is stupid"" modernistic attitude kills every frame of the movie, as if none of the characters he wastes over an hour on matter because MICHAEL MYERS is coming and this time he seems to be based on professional wrestler Kane or The Undertaker. Which is fitting, this is a very modern mall goth approach to story telling, and Rob Zombie is mall metal with an audience that could never hope to name the origins of horror film samples found in his music so I don't know. Michael Myers jumps out and stabs lots of people but its nothing too graphic or interesting, there's no suspense, buildup or pay off. Its just kind of there.
  John Carpenter's early films were minimalist, Rob Zombie films are excessive, so its only ironic his film comes off as an empty exercise in generic slasher fare. The late 80s are back I guess.",1223683200,10,3039,4.639405204460966
3178933,5,B000VKL6Z2,"The 1st thing I noticed about this movie was it was from the point of view of the hunter instead of the hunted. For the 1st time wee see what Michael sees not what his victims see. This version does an extensive build up of the Michale Myres character from his child hood of abuse- how his step dad mentally and physically abuses him and how his sister ignores him. We learn how he was picked on at school to the point this small 10 yr old snaps. We also get to learn about his obsession with masks and how he dealt with being in the mental institution as well as how he escaped and the storyline of how he became the monster he was in the previous movies. The 1st part of the movie gets the viewer to see exactly what happened to this small child to push the right buttons to create the perfect killing machine.
.
The cinematography was great from the film color dating the movie back 20 yrs. With some modern changes to how high school kids act now a days to add to the realism. The blood wasn't over done or digitalized. Zombie kept a sense of realism that made the movie that much more believable raising the scare factor.

Of course if you follow zombies previous films you will see a hand full of actors and actresses make an appearance from time to time. The children actors did an amazing job as well. The other thing I liked was I never got bored. I remember the old slasher flicks like the Freddy and the Jason films as well as the old Halloween movies- during scenes of character development there was a lot of boring dialog that slowed the movies down to a crawl and lost my interest until another sex scene or another killing depending on the film I was watching.

3178935,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I was very interested in an updated version of the film, plus the previews looked really dark and creepy.  Unfortunately, I went and saw the movie...

For one, ALL of the characters have abnormally filthy mouths.  Even Laurie had a filthy mouth, which made it very hard to think of her as a victim I'd want to survive.

Secondly, I don't need a lengthy biography on Michael.  I wish they'd just leave at him being a born sociopath.  Instead they made it due to child abuse and being picked on in school.  What was interesting in the first one was when the parents run up to Michael after he's stabbed Judith to death and the parents look completely normal; their son is just crazy.  Also in this remake here, Judith was an awful person and I was completely apathetic to her death.  In fact, she pretty much deserved.  I prefer innocent victims.

Rob Zombie knows how to create an awesome atmosphere, but he should NOT write his own scripts.  He makes his characters so hard to like and they all have mouths like a bunch of uneducated trash.

Apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie, but I hated every single character and basically sided with Michael despite how much I already hated his character.  In my opinion, this movie is an enormous failure and it does not deserve this 3 disc special edition.",1222905600,40,1307,4.52991452991453
3178936,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm not a big horror fan. My housemates have repeatedly talked me into watching slasher film after slasher film, and I still just can't get into the genre. But this film is different. This film is actually really good. And that's not to say that other slasher films aren't. (I could never discredit the Scream series.) Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" just goes beyond the simple bad-guy-with-a-knife stereotype and delivers an amazingly scary and sad story of a well-known fictional psychopath.

In this version of ""Halloween"", director Rob Zombie doesn't just retell the original story in his own style - he retells it well: Zombie's ""Halloween"" is more of a biography of Michael Myers than a slasher film staring Michael Myers. The first and best example of this is the opening act of the film: the back-story of Myers's childhood is almost thirty minutes long. (Most slasher films tell the back-story in a short five-minute teaser before the opening credits.) Once the audience is attached to Myers' character, the story progresses to show Myers' troubled life in a mental institution, his escape from the mental institution and finally his killing spree. Most films wouldn't go into this much detail on the nemesis's character which is what makes Zombie's version so good.

Overall, this movie will likely appeal more to horror fans but non-horror fans, such as myself, may enjoy it too. Yes, it shows blood and guts, but it's a great retelling of Michael Myers's story and I highly recommend it.",1222819200,2,1493,4.991967871485944

3178938,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Nothing will compare with the original for any die hard or old timer. But being a die hard and working my way to old timer I liked the perspective change to the main characters point of view. The over use of nudity reminded me of much of the schlock in the 1980's. Malcolm McDowell's performance as the kindly doctor seemed too sloppy considering the caliber of actor he is. Most of the cast were all top notch in their character portrayals for the quality of actors present. If you are a fan of any of Rob Zombies other films you will recognize old favorites returning in new rolls. It was a good attempt at breathing new life into the old franchise but seemed a bit rushed in scripting and a bit in production you can tell by the dialog. The film seems to drag a bit in the end when most fans are ready to move on to something else.  The saving grace for me was the sets, cinematography, and yes even the some of the slapstick dialogue. Not since Mortal Combat and Manos the Hands of Fate have I stopped a movie dead in its tracks to confirm that I heard what I thought I did. Look if you are home alone on Saturday night and feel like self medicating and watching a new movie you will like it. Now if the Idea of a good time is watching a film by H.G.

3178939,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This was a decent movie to add to the endless list of Halloween movies in the franchise.  It spends the first hour giving backstory to how Michael Myers came to be the unstoppable killer he becomes when he grows older.  While that was fascinating to endure, in the end it ultimately felt empty, unnecessary, and not believable.  The acting wasn't that great in the backstory by any of the players.  They seemed to over do it and try to hard.  Screaming absurd dialogue at one another to the point where I just wanted to smack them to chill out.  The original Halloween is much like the original Psycho movie.  Nothing can come close to the classics.  John Carpenter's Halloween had little gore, but managed to create atmosphere and fright.  This Halloween is heavy on the gore, but it lacked suspense.  I enjoyed it merely to see a new take on Halloween.  It was entertaining to a degree while feeling disjointed and all over the place at times.

This was an interesting approach that's watchable and managed to hold my attention.  Things don't really take off into after the first hour.  Until then I was subjected to",1220918400,,1118,4.637755102040816

3178941,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie has continued to surprise and impress. With my first veiwing of his cult classic House of 1000 Corpses, it was very clear that i had underestimated his skill as an artist. With the Devils Rejects it once again became massively overstated that he was capable of much more as an artist and a writer than we could ever have predicted, and the shocking violence and intesity becomes addictive and always memorable. Zombie's remake of the legendary classic Halloween brings him full circle as an intelligent creative individual with his trademark of stark realism and uninhibited aggression. Zombie's films are honored as landmarks in the genre and equally praised by followers as he praised these films in his own music. Rob Zombies Halloween is one of the most effective looks at the nature and motivations of violence and sociopathology in horror cinema, and each film stands as a relevant social/political commentary that mocks the multifaceted and seemingly facist agenda of the MPAA and the PMRC. thankfully the cast of the films remains standard, giving the terrifying worlds that Zombie creates an ominous familiarity.

I loved how it gives a very in-depth look into the childhood of Michael Myers and showed the abuse he suffered from his step father and his parents weren't Leave It To Beaver parents like they are portrayed on the original movie. I don't know what there is not to like about this movie. When I watched this movie in theaters, I literally had to check my pulse I was jumping so much. Rob Zombie had a big mountain to climb and he has achieved its height.

I thought McDowell was fantastic as Dr. L and was a worthy successor to DP who played the character originally. I also enjoyed all of the cameos of other horror movie icons.

The most innovative and creative part of Zombie's film is the first hour where he explores the birth of a serial killer. Zombie's extraordinary depiction of Michael's life in a hellish home where domestic violence is the norm and sexually explicit language abounds is so well done. The young actor who portrays Michael is perfect. Sherri Moon Zombie plays Michael's mother quite well and even throws in a pole dance for good measure. Michael's life in a mental institution is also extremely well done, culminating in a bloody murder spree as he escapes. One wishes Zombie had stopped there and called the film: ""Halloween: The Beginning"". Unfortunately,the last 45 minutes of the film consists of an extremely weak and hurried remake of Carpenter's original film. Laurie Stode, Michael's sister, is so annoying that you will want to kill her yourself. She wines and screams all the time and it's merciful when Michael kills her equally annoying friends. The last 20 mintues of this bloody mess are pure agony -- a confusing mishmash of mayhem as Michael knocks holes in an attic, trying to pry Laurie out. So dumb. I must, however, compliment Malcom McDowell on his performance as Dr. Loomis. He brings dignity to a role that was owned by Donald Pleasance. An odd and annoying thing about this film is the confusion about the time in which it is set. The musical soundtrack is late 70's, but people are using cell phones. Guys have long hair, but girls are wearing clothes that appear to be at least 90's stuff. Just makes your head want to explode. Runtime is about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Way too long and absolutely exhausting. Trust me, the original and most of its sequels are better ways to spend your time.",1217635200,,2333,5.824561403508772
3178945,3,B000VKL6Z2,"In order to make this a more brief and positive review, I will disregard the entire first half of the film.  Rob Zombie should have kept Michael's personality and motives more of a mystery, because I think this aspect of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is what has helped to make it a timeless genre masterpiece.
  That said, I believe that the last hour of the film is quite faithful to the original film, and even takes it to highs that John Carpenter, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis would never have imagined.
The actor playing adult Michael in this film is much larger than Nick Castle was in 1978's ""Halloween"", and this immediately makes him more frightening.  The pace of the last hour is swift and flawless, and Zombie wisely pays homage to many scenes and set-pieces of the original movie.  The Doyle house is particularly cinematic and creepy, even more so than the Meyer's house.  There are odes to the original, which Zombie was wise to include, and Carpenter's original score is used generously and respectfully.
  Malcolm McDowell is a good doctor Loomis, very different from Donald Pleasence's performance, and necessarily so.  Scout Taylor-Compton is a terrific Laurie Strode, in the final scenes especially, but she squints too much, and it was like watching a performance from one of those apple-face dolls.  The real revelation of this film is Danielle Harris.  She wipes away her Jamie Lloyd persona (her character from ""Halloween"" 4&5) completely, and emerges as a new form of scream queen.  Her Annie Brackett is more believable than the other actresses' performances, and Annie's anguished attempts to warn Laurie out of the Wallace house were the most blood-curdling screams I've ever heard in a movie.  I don't know where Danielle Harris got those unearthly cries, but they are anguished and unforgettable.  I believe that this is the best acting that she's done.
  There's also a particularly great bonus feature on the second disc - Adrienne Barbeau's deleted scene!  She looks incredible, quite like she did in ""The Fog"", and her scene just crackles with tension.  Too bad it didn't make it into the final cuts of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"".",1215907200,,2166,4.9529085872576175
3178946,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I saw the original Halloween in theaters and loved it. Have seen it many times since, and Carpenter's version is great. Just about all the sequels blew one way or the other, changing Michael Myers from a lunatic into an unstoppable juggernaut. Bullets can't stop him! Fire can't stop him! Decapitation can't stop him! Who cares anymore?! This began a whole trainload of bat guano mascarading as horror/splatter flicks like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elmstreet, ad naseum, with monsters that can't be killed and teenagers who can, and are, no matter how clever they are. The fanboy geeks love it because their sophistication level isn't exactly stellar, let's face it.

This is why Rob Zombie made House of 1,000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects - to bring the horror back into horror films. The creepiness level and humor that made the early genre so great is missing during later entrees - and even more so in the whole alleged ""re-invention"" with crapola like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Saw, Hostel....

Zombie's Halloween is a slightly different film than Carpenters, almost as if you are seeing the same story from another perspective. And it's brilliant. The first half (the part many horror nerds gripe about because they can't stand characterization and just want to see gore and blood and some dumb creep in a halloween mask killing people as fast as he can - ""what's the body count, dude?"") is riveting and far more interesting than the 2nd half, which plays out like the original movie. But even that part is great. This movie has got to be one of the best ""slasher flicks"" of all time. I can't wait to see what Rob comes up with next.",1215388800,3,1657,4.710344827586207
3178947,2,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career, in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film, HALLOWEEN, Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.

Everyone already knows the tale of Michael Myers, the psychopath from Haddonfield, IL, who murdered his sister only to be committed to an institution he would later escape from with the intent of more killings back home years later. While that is the basis for Zombie's film, it is not a remake but more of a retelling, a reinvention of the same character.

Here we are offered young Michael and the household he grows up in that forms his life. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper, saddled with a new husband (William Forsythe) who is disabled and a neer do well more interested in yelling at the kids than in offering any sort of role model. Michael's sister is a trashy sleep with anyone teen who dresses provocatively and does little else. All of this is not lost on Michael who spends his time killing his pets and taking photos of them. What we are being offered is a textbook glimpse as to why a youngster becomes a serial killer. The nice middle class family shown in the original is tossed aside for this new group. And in this first portion of the film, the problems Zombie has are apparent.

Zombie has filled three films now with the same characters. Sure, they may have different names and different small time characteristics, but the fact remains that he focuses on the dysfunctional family and their housecleaning inabilities. Yes, it seems that all families in Zombie's world can't clean to save themselves. Not only that but they all have the same dingy look to their living quarters as well as references to pop culture. The house Michael grows up in could be a home that the Firefly family would feel comfortable in. It all looks the same and that detracts greatly from the viewing experience, unless of course you'd never seen another Rob Zombie film.

Comparisons to the original film are inevitable and this will most likely be the downfall of the film in the long run. Michael goes overboard with his murderous rampage as a child in this film unlike the original. Where no blood was seen in that film, it flows freely now. Perhaps this is due to the changing times, but it adds nothing to the scares of the film or the character. It does make him a more brutal killer, leaving him one without a touch of sympathy. But the mindless killer from the original is replaced by someone we feel absolutely nothing for now.

Once finished with the whole back story of young Michael, his family and the kindly Dr. Loomis (Michael McDowell) who takes care of him at the institution, we move forward 15 years to when Michael escapes and heads back home. The body count increases once more as he kills everyone he comes into contact with their, including a worker who had befriended him. Once out, the story becomes more familiar, almost a duplicate of the original shot from different angles, with different actors and focusing less on the character of Laurie Strode, the central character in John Carpenter's version.

Laurie and her friends are nothing more than meat to be slaughtered by Michael in this one. There is no development of character, no reason for us to think of them as more than teens in peril that we have seen in hundreds of other slasher flicks. While we cared about the original teens, this time around they seem less human and placed in our way for two reasons: to be killed by Michael and to offer more exposed flesh than the first.

By the film's end we are offered the traditional sliced and diced teens, gratuitous nudity and enough blood to make a special effects company weep for joy at the size of their bill. But we have gained nothing in the iconography that is Michael Myers. While we are given more background on him, we care less about him than we ever did.

Worst of all is the fact that Rob Zombie, a director that showed such great potential before, seems to be telling us after only three films that this is all he has to offer. Stories told from the same world, a world that blasts apart the whole FATHER KNOWS BEST world we would all like it to be. In his world, there is no caring parent. And when they are caring, they are twisted in some revolting way.

I haven't given up on Zombie yet though. Having recently signed a two picture deal with the Weinstein's, perhaps he will show us he has more tricks up his sleeve than he let on. But if he returns to the carnie soiled world he's offered in three films to date, then it looks as though he's a one note director. Let's hope he offers us more. It's in there somewhere.",1214524800,12,4947,4.54320987654321
3178948,5,B000VKL6Z2,"There's far more Rob Zombie bashing in these reviews than is needed so I'm going to twist it back. John Carpenter may have came up with a great idea with ""Halloween"" but his version was always an overrated horror classic and a blatant ripoff of the original ""Black Christmas"". Bashing Zombie for remaking a ""classic"" in his own way is like bashing Carpenter for remaking ""The Thing"" in his own way. The major difference is ""The Thing"" is the only good Carpenter movie. Had he only written ""Halloween"" and let someone else direct it and had a better cast for it, it might have been a classic. Some common complaints with my rebuttal:

Malcolm McDowell vs Donald Pleasence: McDowell is criticized for overacting? You're joking! What has every role Pleasence has taken on been? Good drama? You can tell he started as a stage actor and he should have stayed there. Don't worry, Don, we get the point that only you can understand why Michael Myers is doing what he's doing and we can also understand why no one will listen to you when you're acting more like a lunatic than a doctor.

Scout Taylor-Compton vs Jamie Lee Curtis: JLC was never the scream queen as far as I was concerned and I commend her for realizing that so early in her career and getting out of horror. Does anyone care to remember Prom Night? I doubt she does. She did an okay job in Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and you didn't want to see her get killed but Scout Taylor-Compton was far more convincing in Zombie's ""Halloween"". It could have been the way her character was written, though, because she has no idea that Myers is her brother and, in the end, she fights harder and shows more fear than our heroine did in the original movie.

Sluts vs Sluts: People have complained about the ""sluts"" in Zombie's version. Times have changed, people, and there's not much we can do about it, but let's not forget that there were sluts in the original version also, and back then no-one complained. I fail to see the point in this argument. Read the rating on the back of the DVD and it will tell you why the movie is Rated R or 18A. You shouldn't be shocked then when you watch the film.

Rob Zombie vs John Carpenter: Zombie has shown more style and promise with ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Halloween"" than I could have predicted. He's cutting edge and definitely knows how to push buttons. Carpenter has had his shining moment(s), ""Halloween"" (to some) and ""The Thing"" but that's a long time ago. But I'll give him this saving grace: He always wrote better music than Rob Zombie or White Zombie ever did.

All in all, I found Zombie's version very suspenseful and fearful, and I've enjoyed repeated viewings to the same degree. I can understand why this movie might be too much for some people, but to call it garbage because there's too much gore...well, you might as well call Carpenter's ""The Thing"" garbage for the same reason.",1213574400,2,2887,4.576402321083172

I saw this film in theatre and I was wowed by the power and impact of film, even though the supernatural element seemed a little drained from the film. For someone like Rob Zombie, the surreal seems to reign supreme in his art, but that was in what I saw in the Booklet art of HELLBILLY DELUXE, however, in film Rob seems to want to go for the ""real"".
 The First part of the film was, as I understand it, shot basically shot in sequence, so that by the time they got to Institution sequences, not only has the Young actor playing Michael actually Grown, but Tyler Mane gets a chance to incorporate Young Michaels moves into his own styles. Probably the most shocking scenes and therefore the best items to watch and pick apart, take place at the Institution, the Truck Stop ( Ken Foree is just so Cool in a scene he makes so his own, even though you have two huge guys obviously trying to outdo each other, and this is more
so when you realise that the side of the stall they damage is NOT the stunt stall, its the real metal), and the element I find most surprising is that whilst Young Michael ( the actor) needs a stunt double, so does [ they said] the Huge Tyler Mane;Tyler Objected to the Double on one point, and the double for ""Young Michael"" is a girl... my question is, before hearing the commentary or the features, can you pick them ?
Anyways, This Unrated is a very well deserved edition. Expect more... you might even pick up some of the tricks on how Michael Hides in a shot, when he is 6'9 and hard to miss.

DVD: The Bonus Features. Standout features on this are the deleted scenes or the Bloopers where Malcolm McDowell and Brad Douriff do a brilliant job at riffing off each other ( if only these two had been contracted to do a Commentary track with cast).The Features are worth it indeed. The Commentary however, is technically informative, but dry and unentertaining as you could have it. If they are going to have a film school class track, they could at least have an entertaining commentary track.

3178956,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's Halloween has breathed new life into the series for me.  It is in my opinion, that many people don't like this version of Halloween, simply because it is not the original.  Many people feel as though ""classic"" movies should be left alone.  However, for those who can accept that classics are not some sacred piece of work that can never be touched, this version of Halloween has a lot to offer on its own.

Unlike the original Halloween, this version of Halloween gives us some insight into Michael Myers' past, while taking a few liberties from the original.

In the original Halloween, it is kind of implied that Michael Myers came from a normal family, and for some unexplained reason he decided to murder his sister.  Then the story fast forwards 15 years.  In Zombie's Halloween, Michael Myers comes from a ""white trash"" dysfunctional family.  His mother is a stripper, his step-father is verbally abusive, and his older sister is neglectful and self-centered.  At school, Myers is bullied by older, bigger students.

As the story progresses, we learn that Michael shows some psychopathic symptoms, such as the enjoyment of harming and killing animals while showing no remorse.

In this re-imagining of the original, we even get to see Michael during his time in the mental institution, and we witness the character drift further into the ""darkness"" and become more evil.  Another thing I liked, was we get to see how Michael got his mask (we even find out why he wears a mask).  In the original, Michael escapes the mental institution, stole a random mask at a hardware store, and that's that.  In this version of Halloween, the mask actually kind of has a story of its own.

Eventually the story essentially picks up where the original Halloween starts, and in fact, many of the scenes are re-created nearly shot for shot.  This has turned off many, but for me, I actually like it.  It kinda brought everything full circle from him being certified into the mental institution, to his escape, and then to where things started in the original Halloween.

Many people also didn't like how ""human"" Michael Myers seems in this version of Halloween.  I take what they mean by that is, we know too much of the character.  Where in the original, he was a killer who just kinda showed up out of nowhere and started killing for no apparent reason.  However, I also disagree with this.  In Zombie's Halloween, Michael Myers is scarier than he has ever been.  He is very scary.  For the very fact that there could be a real life ""Michael Myers"" among us.  He isn't just some supernatural killer who only shows up in nightmares.  And he isn't some mindless, unstoppable zombie with a machete.  Michael Myers could be among us.  There could very well be someone who has suffered severe trauma at some point in life, who is being consumed by emotional darkness.  Hopefully not, but the possibly is could very easily happen.

Overall, if your a purist, then this movie will only disappoint.  However, if you like Halloween, but can accept that this movie is a new movie, not a sequel to the last Halloween, and not meant to be a direct re-make of the original, then this movie should be pleasantly entertaining. I consider it the best of the Halloween movies so far.",1209859200,5,3270,4.724381625441696

The script and characters are cardboard and plot holes (like what happened to the sheriff after he found his daughter?) plague this dud.  Yes, I know, horror films are noted for brilliant narratives but the original was effective in its simplicity.  Michael's back story took way too long -- was it even needed? -- and there was no sense of climax.

It seems that Zombie grows white trash on a farm and incorporates every said type of actor into his movies, and this one goes to the extreme on that regard.  Tons and tons of needless cussing and nudity, not to mention a rape scene that is beyond too much.  Also, there are lengthy periods of time during this movie that you struggle not to fall asleep.

3178960,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Ridley Scott's American Gangster about real life bad guy and drug lord, Frank Lucas, in American Gangster receives two Oscar noms.  Forrest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin.  Who says you can't do a biopic film of a fictional character?  Rob Zombie does just that in this biography, not remake, of horror icon Michael Myers.  I would also guess that more Americans have probably heard of the fictional, Michael Myers, than Amin, or Lucas.

Zombie's Halloween goes into detail of Michael as a child, while there is still something of a child left, and the hell on earth that exists in many households.  Michael Myers will become the manifestation of evil in society.  Halloween was reminiscent of David Cronenberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brood/dp/B00009PY2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brood</a>&nbsp;and how the mother's anger physically manifested itself as she spawned deformed children to seek out what angered her.  Unlike the mother in The Brood Michael doesn't lash out at society but becomes the evil in society and eventually will no longer be human.  True evil cannot be stopped with a gun or a knife and neither can Michael Myers.

My point is Zombie's film can be looked at as poetic and a message for non violence (you think I'm crazy).  Michael Myers is a metaphor for the evil in our society, specifically the evil that hides in the suburbs behind closed doors.  Myers uses a mask to hide this evil as suburbs could mask this with white picket fence as a happy front. If you can't use violence to stop this evil as we do in our society then you have to go to the roots, the family and family values.  Similarly the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Cups-of-Tea-One-Man-s-Mission-to-Promote-Peace-One-School-at-a-Time/dp/0143038257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time</a>&nbsp;which uses education to fight terror where it starts and not bombs.

There are two moments in the film where, Michael Myers, the boy fights that evil.  The first, after Michael has murdered his family and is locked away in an institution he has an emotional breakdown with Dr. Loomis at Christmas time.  Michael for an instant realizes the situation and is terrified this reminded me of Regan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-25th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/079073804X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;as the demon left her.  Flash to the next scene and Michael is gone and the evil has taken him.  The second moment after Michael has kidnapped Laurie he once again becomes human for a  moment, drops his knife, and shows his face to his sister, once Laurie stabs him and he puts the mask back on Michael is now dead and there is only evil.

Zombie has a stellar cast of horror veterans that there are too many to list.  Zombie does not use this as a gimmick or to wink at horror fans the film is taken seriously from beginning to end and their are solid performances all around.  Rob Zombie seems to get better with each film as does his wife Sheri Moon Zombie who gave a solid performance as Michael's mother.  The photograph that is shown at the end was very effective and tragic.

3178961,2,B000VKL6Z2,"What happens when you give a horror fanatic like Rob Zombie the liberty to do as he wishes on a horror franchise like John Carpenter's ""Halloween""? Unfortunately you get bored to death with one cliche ridden scene after another. What the hell happened? I didn't think his first two films were bad, not great, but not awful either. I figured the major problem here is the same deal you'll get from Tarantino or Rodriguez, they're film enthusiasts. They're better skilled at creating tributes to the films they love than adding any original ideas of their own. That being said the film isn't a complete remake. If you've seen the original ""Halloween"" you'll remember that it starts with Michael breaking out of the asylum. In the new revamp version Zombie, in the first act, gives us a glimpse of what Michael was like as a child and what led him to be locked away in an asylum in the first place. Oddly enough I think the first act (all the scenes that eventually lead into his killing spree) is excellent. I would have rather have seen a film about  a child growing up into the killer instead of just a simple explanation for the sake of exposition. Imagine what a riskier and much more controversial film that would have been! And what a way to reawaken the franchise which was originally hit or miss anyhow. Regardless, once Michael escapes the asylum we are treated to simple slasher film clichs with no rhyme or reason for half the killings. Were any of these people in his way in the first place? How does he know to find his sister? Basically he just goes on a killing spree for the sake of a killing spree and several times I found myself yawning and losing interest. Forget about tension because without that rhyme and reason you get none. I wanted to enjoy this film but it was a total let down.

3178963,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Anyone who has seen the original Halloween and the sub standard fodder that followed knows that this is possibly one of the best horror flicks made at the time. To step up and remake it takes someone with a passion for the original and the will to do it justice by making a film that pays homage and builds on it.

Zob Zombie stepped up to the challenge and has come out of it with an excellent version.

Using a well cast younger Michael Myers we see the degrading mental state of a child into the monster that was Michael Myers, but also right upto the end when we see him capture his sister there's a touching element to the love of a brother for that of his baby sister. There were so many extra segments generated into this new version that simply did it so much more justice, and in my view eclipsed the original.

The down side for me, and this is personal, I felt that Malcolm Macdowell was very poorly cast, he just wasn't up to the role originally filled by Donald Pleasance. He himself always appears to act with a complete contempt for the role, and never really makes you believe in him, okay maybe just my opinion a very small blip in an excellent film that fills the gaps the original left behind.

3178964,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie did a great job on Halloween. He made it his own movie. I had doubts when I first heard about this about a year ago. But as previews and news started popping up, I knew a masterpiece was soon to be born.

The best thing about Zombie's version is the fact that Michael has a backstory. We get to see Michael's life as a kid and his life in the sanitarium. Rob Zombie really made it feel so realistic and so fascinating.

Another great thing is that Michael isn't some in-destructable superhuman. He can actually die. In the original, and also many of the sequels, no matter what people do to him, he will not die. I think Rob Zombie's is the more realistic of the series.

So all the people who hate Rob Zombie's Halloween, I have one question.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU???

3178965,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The Good Things
*Strong, vivid photography and style.
*Good acting.  Great portrayal of Michael Meyers; this film fully explores his genesis, and it is very brutal and gripping.  Malcom McDowell is interesting as the psychiatrist.
*Excellent sound and music design.
*Lots of bloody killings.  Horror fans should be satisfied.

The Bad Things
*Many of the girls in the film scream incessantly and act stupidly.  Sometimes, you want to yell at the screen ""What are you doing? Run!!"" Could also be a good thing, because it's suspenseful.
*None of the victims show as much strength as Jamie Lee Curis did in the original version.  The one surviving character shows this only in the very very last second.
*There is stronger brutality, more swearing, more sex, and more blood.  Fans of the older, classier version may not like this.

I really hated the original ""Holloween,"" so I believe this is a superior version.  Its style is not only modernized, but also downright scary and unsettling.  I am particuarly impressed by its portrayal of Michael Meyers; there is much more character depth to him, and they go into his back story much more deeply.  Instead of being an inhumane, unkillable, supernatural entity, he is a human monster, and that is perhaps much more frightening (and maybe more realistic).  There is more bad content (sex, violence, swearing), but I do not think it is entirely overwhelming.  Horror fans everywhere should at least look at this rendition, for it is quite intense.",1206230400,4,1491,4.987854251012146

3178968,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's interpretation of the John Carpenter classic horror film ""Halloween"" is a much crueler variation on the traditional story.  I found it to also be a tribute to horror fans.

The movie tells the story of Micheal Myers upbringing that planted the seeds of his homicidal mania.  It was quite moving, in my opinion, as the parents yelled and screamed at each other in front of their infant child.

In many ways, the movie was also a tribute to the slashers of the '80's.  I have never seen so many teens having sex and getting maimed for it since my '80's favorites, the Friday the 13th series.

The movie also had many horror acting favorites coming in for cameos, including original ""Dawns..."" Ken Foree, Rob Zombie fave Sid Haig, Sybil Danning, Danny Trejo as a sympathetic janitor, and several others... I really liked Malcolm McDowell's performance, as well as the grown up sister of Micheal.

Zombie also peppered the film with clips from classic horror movies, naturally Zombie's favorite genre.  I was also very happy they kept the traditional ""Halloween"" theme song.

The murder's are atrocious, the story is good, and ultimately, Zombie took the classic and made it his own.  And despite the fact that I agree that you shouldn't mess with a classic, they both tell a fine horror story.",1205625600,4,1303,4.802690582959642

This is what happens when people can't think of any new ideas. First try to copy and imitate the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with one movie... now do a remake of a classic and fail miserably.

What exactly does this have to do with the original?... This is Rob Zombie's warped version of a classic.

We have some twisted version of the 1970's with a family of Rednecks. Michael Myers is their child.  You can see the kids face- There is no mystery in this at all-  Then we have the same plot as the original with different things added. Then the story switches over to present day and the same old story except 10 times worse.  Here we have Malcolm McDowell as Doctor Loomis and the lady from E.T.... Even these good actors couldn't save this mess of a movie.

 The horror genre really needs to think up something new instead of recyling the same old movies and failing at it. You have the greats and then you have the copiers and imitators who end up trying to copy legends and failing everytime. This is another example of that.  I strongly recomend you do not see this-  it will disapoint you.

But I digress.

I have to admit that while I've watched Rob Zombie's other movies, none of them have been remarkable for me.  However, this remake of Halloween has certainly gotten my attention.

What I love about this remake is that there are background information added to the story.  For example, how Michael came to be this ""immortal"" serial killer.  Rob Zombie takes us back to Michael's childhood.  It seems that Michael has always been a bad seed, limiting his evil deeds with just mutilating animals.  The monster in him emerges when he reaches a breaking point with his classmates bullying him, his mother always working, the mother's boyfriend constantly picking on him, and his older sister neglecting him for her boyfriend.  Only his innocent baby sister escapes his rage.

Years later, we see Michael breaking out of an asylum.  What's freaky is that Michael is this huge guy, about 6'8"".  Michael makes those WWF guys look like sissies.  So, can you imagine facing a serial killer with that kind of build?  That's enough to scare the nine lives outta you.  (I know, I know...we're not cats.)

Anyways, if you've seen the original in regards to Michael's return to Haddonfield, you'll start to connect the missing pieces that Rob Zombie presents with what you can remember (from John Carpenter's film).

It's a interesting idea to bring back a classic to the big screen in this age. The only problem is if you can't make it just as good as the original then leave it alone.

The film way just way too much in the way of gore. I love how the original focused more on terror then tons of blood and guts, leaving the brutality more to the imagination then right in front of your eyes. Then there is Laurie. The way she was portrayed in this version was far from innocent and extremely annoying. I was actually hoping Myers would kill her to shut her up. The original made her so innocent which added to the terror. Then you have the ultra white trash Myers family which was yet another strike. The original showed michael coming from the typical middle class family which made it so much more effective. And what about Dr. Loomis? Thank God they didn't cast this guy as the original. Halloween just isn't the same without the real Loomis. The only thing that did make sense was the freakish size of myers. I mean he always seemed to have superhuman strength but looked like a normal size man. Here he was a monster. This would explain why he could crush someones head with his bare hands.

They are just Chainsaw rip-offs.

Im only 20 minutes in and I have to wonder why mess with the story so much? The original Carpenter masterpiece was flawless. So why change EVERYTHING??? When Michael killed his family in the original it was in 1963. Now Zombie has Michael running around with a KISS T shirt and listening to KISS. I love KISS don't get me wrong. But the band formed in the early 70's. Why change that? And why change the dynamic of Michaels parents? In the original you only see them in the scene after he killed his sister. His parents were clean cut people. Why take the father out of the picture all together and replace him with a drunken step-dad? Why turn mom into a stripper? To show how Mike got so screwed up? Thats all fine and dandy but even clean cut families have dysfunction. Why did Zombie have to change basically the WHOLE MOVIE??? Why even re-make Halloween at all???

Please listen to me. If you love the original you owe it to yourself NOT to watch this film. It takes what was great about the original and flushes it right down the toilet.",1203033600,4,1414,4.332075471698113

3178983,3,B000VKL6Z2,"This week we, Sid the Elf, decided to review the remake or whatever of the greatest horror film ever, Halloween. Now, we knew that this film was done by the ever-creepy Rob Zombie so we realized going in that things had a chance to get wierd or stupid but this one was ridiculous. It was a remake of the classic, kind of but not really. And the parts that were the same as the original were different here. Sounds confusing? Well how about watching this in an altered state trying to figure it out?

The bulk of the film concentrated on Michael Myers's early life and his rise to the top of the world of serial killing. The funniest parts of this movie came in the section where the evil stepdad was making fun of a young Myers calling him a freak and questioning his sexuality while Myers stands there taking it while wearing a homemade mask. It doesn't get much funnier than that. You also had young Myers making the ""I want to wrestle you so freaking bad"" face whenever anyone made him mad. Well, when he wasn't wearing one of his little masks. That was great. Also, young Myers offered us a couple of freakouts. The one when he went off on Loomis was awesome. If this movie was not a remake of a classic, and stood on its own, it would have made a pretty good horror B as all the elements were there. However, when you look at this film as the remake that it was, it fell way short.

First, Sid would like to talk to you about Loomis. In the original, he was the best part about the film. Who could forget such classic lines as, ""Tell your men to keep their eyes open and their mouths closed,"" along with many others. In the remake Loomis offered nothing, he had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. He even exploited Myers's psycosis by writing a book and going on a speaking tour over it. Then, there was Laurie. In the first film, she was sweet and innocent and you really did not want Myers to catch her. This was one of the things that made the original. In the new version, she was trashy and annoying. Sid was hoping they would change the ending and have Myers strangle her by the 30 minute mark. Finally, there was Myers. In this one, he was a giant goon, which does explain his freakish strength and adds a lot in the way of unintentional comedy. But, he was so goofy. Sid even joked that Kane was playing him, only to find out that it was actually a more b wrestler that we'd never even heard of! Big Sky is the guy's name for the record.

So, this film was ok at best. That's factoring in all the unintentional comedy by goofy Myers, young Myers, and the stepdad; and the um, comedic mood Sid was in. Apperances by Clint Howard and Danny Trejo helped ease the pain a little. Oh, and the few times the film featured ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" was a pretty cool nod to the original and to more cowbell. But, Zombie's version concentrated too much on the gore of Myers' killings and his disturbed past really trying to drive home the fact that this man is totally insane. Yeah, we kind of got that by the huge killing spree, but I guess when you're Rob Zombie that's not really enough to classify someone as off the reservation. This one is probably only worth checking out if you've never seen the original and want to settle in with a decent horror B or if you just want to make fun of fat young Myers for a little bit. All in all 3 stars, not great, not bad. It insists upon itself, I like The Money Pit.",1201651200,3,3416,4.252307692307692
3178984,1,B000VKL6Z2,"This had enormous potential considering Zombie's artistic repertoire. WOW did this one disappoint.

And Laurie Strode is a joke...she is no different than any of the other teens in the film...oops, bad mistake. Plus the actress is not good either. And we get it, Rob Zombie, you are an immense fan of Sid Haig and Ken Foree, do they REALLY need to be in every movie you make?

It was good to have more backstory about Michael Myers, although they could have tightened it up a bit.  One thing I enjoyed (although it has nothing to do with the story) was that practically the whole cast from ""The Devils Rejects"" (Zombie's previous film) was somewhere in this move, mostly in small parts, but it was still fun.",1201478400,,437,4.37037037037037

And to be made by Rob Zombie which meant to me that it was going to be nothing but loads of swearing, nudity, and blood. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt because just maybe it could be good and really dive inside the mind of Michael Myers. But sadly and horribly I was very wrong. It was exactly how i thought it would be. I thought there could have been hope with the whole background but no. To me it just seemed to be a waste of time for the film. I read someone else's review and highly agree with them...Rob Zombie should have just made Halloween 9.",1201392000,8,756,4.149659863945578
3178988,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I wanted to do the original Omen for my 666th review, but I have been wanting to watch this film for a long time. My review is for the unrated 3 disc set from Circuit City.

I went into this film with the mind set that this was a Halloween movie from a parallel universe. If you want to enjoy this film, try not think of it as a remake....OK?...alright, here we go.

This film is well produced and the first half deals with young Michael Myers at age 10. Although sort of interesting to watch, it really doesn't give us much more insight than the original on why he's so evil. Carpenter's film leaves  a lot to the imagination and we all know that what we conjure in our own minds is usually scarier than what we see on screen. This is a new Halloween and we get to see some brutal murders unlike the original. This isn't necessarily a bad a thing.....well,.... I usually don't complain (too much) about really stupid scenes in horror movies, but this film has some real bad ones! Michael is in the mental institution for brutal murders and yet he walks around unchained and is allowed to use forks and knives when he's eating! I guess so he can stab and kill a nurse who is left alone to watch him.

Unlike the original in which ""The Shape"" was actually a slender man and or supernatural being, this guy is huge and should have been restrained in a straight jacket 24/7! I only mention this because it appears Zombie is trying to make this character more ""human"". Well that requires making sense throughout the film. When a couple of ""boneheads"" who work in the hospital try to have their way with a new young female patient, what do they do?........ well, they bring her over to Michael Myer's room where the gigantic lunatic(who loves to kill people)sits making his disturbing masks and they rape her with their backs turned to Mr. Myers! Then, they antagonize and hit Mr. Myers as if he isn't a threat! It's scenes like these that keep this from being a much better movie.

I had no problem sitting through it's 2 hour time length, but I kept thinking how close Zombie came to making a good horror film. As it is,(at least the unrated version I saw), it's a 2 1/2 star horror film. Only in the last 25 minutes or so did it finally build some tension, something the original had in spades! The Michael Myers in this film does look menacing and the film has an upgraded slick look, so Zombie's heart was in the right place. Some things he got very wrong...Unlike the original, I didn't feel this film had anything to do with Halloween as it just seemed to be in the distant background of the film. Carpenter's version was all about Halloween. Also, making Myers a human nut job took a lot away from the unknown eerieness of the character in the original.

The unrated edition has a great transfer and lots of extra goodies. My version had a third disc with the cast at comic con doing a question and answers gig. Now that I have seen the theatrical version, I would have to recommend it over the unrated one, even with some slightly trimmed down gore, it's a way better movie and makes more sense! I give the theatrical version 3 1/2 stars!",1201392000,2,3142,4.390034364261169
3178989,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I'm going to try to be brief here.  The thing about this movie is...it's gritty.  They swear a lot, the teens are perverted, it's bloody and brutal.  But it's also realistic.  The camerawork makes the scenes look real, not extremely neat and tidy like in some recent movies.  It's all believable.  Also, the story is very absorbing.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the first time i watched it.

something i've read many complaints about is the fact that michael is now human.  Personally, i think a human that goes insane is far scarier than just a dude that can't die.  It shows michael as he travels down the dark road, becoming more unstable than before, but still seems to have some grasp on reality (a scene towards the end of the movie).  It also shows his family, which adds sort of an emotional level to the film.

Don't even bother watching the movie if you're going to compare it to John Carpenter's Halloween.  Rob Zombie's Halloween is completely different.  If you're not willing to watch the movie without analyzing everything about it, then don't bother.  You won't enjoy it.  Also, if you dislike shaky camera movements, don't watch it.

Now, for the unrated version vs the theatrical version.  I heard the Unrated flows a bit better, but there are 2 scenes in the unrated that are different from the theatrical.  1 being when he escapes, and the other being the ending.  I heard both scenes were better on the theatrical.  (better scene doesn't equal better flow though.)

I greatly reccomend this movie, unless you fit into one of the categories i described above.",1201305600,,1590,4.684782608695652

3178991,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I don't know what that girl from Philly is on but nobody could have made this movie better than Zombie.  This is real talk, I'm not a Zombie fan but a huge Halloween fan.  One thing this movie is not, is corny.  Every other remake that has come out over the past few years has lacked substance that the original had.  Not at all the case with this movie. When I first saw it in theaters it didn't live up to my expectations because I just wanted to see Meyers suited up in action, doing his thing.  I originally thought the first half dragged as well. But it did give you a clear view to Michael's whole story.  It did a real well job in showing you a lot of things that were very vague in the original movie.  The Directors cut however, a few scenes changed making the movie more realistic.  When Michael returns to Haddonfield the movie just pops off.  Some nights I throw this movie in and just watch the second half because it is just so dope.  Michael is a straight beast in this movie.....he is in 100% prime form.  I never make my mind up based on other peoples reviews, but i just had to drop my two cents on this movie.  This is a very well-acted horror movie with a good understanding of the story.  The dialogue was also pretty funny as always coming from Zombie's team of actors.  By the way......Danielle Harris is fine as hell.",1201132800,,1341,4.24901185770751
3178992,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I have always been a fan of the Halloween films, especially the first one.  That may be part of the reason I was not really impressed by this film.  This movie made me feel ""dirty"" with all of the foul language (especially at the beginning) and the violence involving children.  I felt like this version dealt too much with Michael's childhood.  It really made the third act seem really rushed.  The third act is the section dealing with Michael's adulthood (the material covered in the original Halloween).

I caught myself looking at the timer on my dvd player several times while this movie was playing.  It ran way too long, again primarily because of the extensive time devoted to Michael's childhood.  It almost seemed like this should have been two films, as long as it was.

As for the good things, there were a few.  The new Laurie (who we don't even meet until about an hour into the film) is very good.  She seems much more believable than the Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  There were some scary scenes in the third act as well.

I don't think I would really recommend this movie to anyone except Rob Zombie fans.  I don't think the movie would appeal to general audiences, as few horror films do.  I also think many Halloween series fans will not really enjoy it all that much.  Honestly, I don't see it getting many repeat-viewings on my dvd player.",1201132800,,1368,4.545081967213115
3178993,1,B000VKL6Z2,"It seems that Rob Zombie's Halloween is a love-it-or-hate kind of thing.  Well, that places me firmly in the HATE IT category.  The main problem I have with the story is how much time is devoted to Michael Myers' troubled childhood.  So, little Mikey is picked on at school, he kills animals, and his homelife truly sucks.  So...are we supposed to feel sympathy when he becomes a raging psychopath?  I certainly didn't.

And, since this is a Rob Zombie film, you have to include virtually non-stop profanity, sickening violence and thoroughly loathesome characters.  Others have menioned that Myers' mother was the lone sympathetic character in the film.  And she's a stripper.  Not much sympathy there, either.

Look, I LIKE horror movies.  And I like the original Halloween and maybe about half of the sequels.  But this thing is just pitiful.  There's no suspense, no levity at all, just 2 hours of in-your-face filth and violence.  I can't imagine what anyone sees in this garbage.",1201046400,13,985,4.926829268292683

Zombie didn't really ""remake"" the original, he actually expanded the story and created a very different - but essentially the same - movie. He managed to create a movie that both respects the series and also has ""rob zombie"" written all over it. Couldn't expect more.

This movie deviates enough from the original for it to have been better being the source for a similar horror movie series not entailing Michael Mathers or the Halloween name- had I been seeing something foreign to the Halloween name but fashioned by the basic ideas in it I would have been more satisfied. Or possibly even a Halloween series movie but not about Micheal- rather about a different child who turns into a phsycopath. This movie also lacked any sort of suspense it was just a slasher- yawn. The original lacks the blood and gory available in todays films yet its still much more compelling and suspenseful. What I don't understand is why not continue with the Halloween movie series- if the characters of Micheal and Laurie are still alive why restart the whole thing?",1200614400,,957,4.505747126436781

Tyler Mane makes a great Michael Myers, with his large and intimidating stature.  I also like Malcom Mcdowell as Loomis and the scenes that focused on Michael's time in the institution.  This movie is of an acquired taste, I suppose.  It's Rob Zombie's artistic vision, and not everyone will like it.  Not everyone will think it's art, but those are the risks taken when making a film.

3179003,1,B000VKL6Z2,"""Reimagining,"" and ""reinventing"" are popular words these days. But the truth is, there seems to be a creative bankruptcy that has plagued Hollywood for the past ten years or so. Plenty of foolish horror remakes have come down the line recently (The Hitcher, When a Stranger Calls, The Fog, The Omen), but few of those even hold a candle to Rob Zombie's desecration of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, HALLOWEEN.

Made for literally next to nothing, and with a no-name cast (at the time), Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN created genuine suspense and terror through masterful direction. The atmosphere was thick, the compositions perfect, and the haunting soundtrack was right on the money. Carpenter's vision contained next to no blood and a very small body count. What makes the original HALLOWEEN so deliciously frightening is the anticipation of violence.

Most know the nuts and bolts of the tale. On Halloween night, a 6-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister (after she has sex with her boyfriend) and is sent to a mental institution. Fifteen years later he escapes and returns to his stomping grounds for another round of terror.

Writer/Director Rob Zombie establishes from the outset that his version needs more exposition than the original, and this is a stupendous error. This clich-ridden back story to serial killer Michael Myers is pathetic. Little Michael kills animals, gets picked on at school, and has a morbid fascination with masks. Dr. Samuel Loomis does his best to try and rehab the young boy, but it's to no avail. Michael is pure evil, but we know that going in. That Zombie populates the entire first half of the film with this nonsense is inexplicable.

The excessive first few reels make the second half a frustrating bore. Once Michael escapes from the hospital the film basically turns into a retread of the original, though it contains NO suspense, just a whole lot of spurting blood. Once the killing really begins the entire first half is canceled out almost immediately; we feel nothing. Worst of all, the hero of the original, Laurie Strode, is reduced to a supporting player. Since we don't even get to know her until the hour mark, how much can we care about her? (It must also be said that making Laurie Strode Michael's sister was never Carpenter's original intention. Michael was supposed to be pure evil  on a killing spree. Box office profits and a contractual sequel forced Carpenter to come up with that particular tie-in for part two and he has often said he never liked it. If one watches the original 1978 film, no mention of Laurie's relationship to Michael Meyers is even hinted at.)

With it's overlong prelude about Meyers childhood, what Zombie has ultimately done is turn Michael into the film's hero. The rest of the characters are so despicable that it's impossible to root for them (except for Danny Trejo as a janitor who befriends Michael in the institution). Zombie's trailer trash humor and all-around filth adds nothing and only serve to elicit a smirk or tiny sense of disgust in the viewer.

The sad fact is that this is an incompetent film no matter how you examine it. Just one more brand name rip-off in the name of a quick buck - and the complete debasement of a groundbreaking original. John Carpenter can rest easy. This version will never replace the amazing (and still very scary) 1978 masterpiece.",1200528000,24,3366,4.894736842105263
3179004,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I must have been watching a different movie from some of the other posters because this movie was not only boring but also rambling. Rob Zombie has this annoying trademark of doing everything but literaly forcing you to sympathize with the 'bad guys'. Between the generic and predictable back stories to the sappy music he plays around his antagonists. I LOVE the original Halloween and Halloween 2. As a matter of fact every Halloween movie but 3 was better, and SCARIER, than this movie. I would have loved it if Rob had just made another entry, an original one, in the series rather than trying to turn an already great movie into the generic troubled kid next door scenario. Most of Micheal Myers' mystique was NOT KNOWING what the hell was going on behind that mask. Knowing made me like him less and it made me see him as much less threatening. Two things I doubt Mr. Zombie was goinmg for. ALSO a few things that bothered me about the 're make'

Myers family seemed to be a middle class working family that didn't seem to stand out for any reason in the original. In the remake they are poor white trash. Even the houses fence and landscaping are much different.

They actualy show Micheal in Halloween 2 I think, Maybe 1, for a flash and hes not a long haired blonde kid.

How the hell, in Zombies version, did Micheal know Laurie was his sister? And whynot kill her when he was a child? She was 'innocent' I suppose...blech. Thats the problem with over explaining things. You cant explain some of the minute details and not others that actualy lend to the story.

So he pops out, or pops in, Loomis' eyes yet in the very next scene there is no blood and he can see? WTF.

Laurie Strode was not as big a pussy in the original and Zombie killing her parents in this version seemed very silly.

Rob Zombie, for the love of god please stop using the same cast in every movie. It may work for comedys but this is getting annoying.

Some of you will say this wasn't a remake at all but a retelling of the story in Rob Zombie world...I say whatever. I DO NOT recommend this movie at all for any reason. This is the first horror movie ever that has actualy BORED me and I have seen ALOT of horror movies.

The acting is stellar. Of special note is the young boy who plays the part of a young Michael. He is so believable and terrifying in his role that one forgets he is just acting. The themes of abuse and neglect in a violent childhood, eventually leading to sadistic, heartless violence are very disturbing and realistic. It is a real horror!

THAT was fun.....the deeply evil mind that Michael Myers was born with is what mystifies me, not that he had a bad, bad stepdaddy...(and why did the young Michael Myers have to look like a chubby lesbian in Zombie's film??)
The only thing I will say that maybe redeems this film, but not really, is that there were honestly a few moments when Zombie's scenes eerily brought to life the original, like a spirit returning from the grave.....it was like I was there again, watching it for the first time...but the rest and especially the ending were so disappointing....

3179007,2,B000VKL6Z2,"This 2007 remake flick of HALLOWEEN by Rob Zombie wasn't that good and seemed like a bit of a waste and a rip off even though it had a lot more action, violence, and blood than the original John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece film of HALLOWEEN, plus it wasn't nearly as heart-pounding either, so this was a poor imitation and poor remake and/or resurrection and revision of HALLOWEEN and I don't recommend it anyone, because even though Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick included a human side of Michael Myers and how he became so deranged and psychotic from being bullied at school and coming from trashy family household, Zombie's 2007 HALLOWEEN film lacks style and goes too far with Michaels human side and childhood days, unlike John Carpenter's 1978 HALLOWEEN masterpiece.

For instance, Michael Myers didn't make the heavy breathing sounds like he made in John Carpenters 1978 version of HALLOWEEN and like Michael Myers did in Halloween II as well.

You also wouldn't see Michael Myers one second and then vanishing the next like you did in the original either and Michael Myers wasn't as sneaky either, but it's almost as if they tried to overcompensate by making Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick a lot gorier with a lot more nudity and cussing instead by making the sex, nudity and bloody scenes overkill in comparison to the original, plus Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN left no cliffhanger ending at the end of this HALLOWEEN flick either, unlike John Carpenters 1978 HALLOWEEN flick.

In addition to what sucked about this HALLOWEEN flick by Rob Zombie, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) was very rude, snotty, and annoying, but Lynda(P.J. Soles) in the original 1978 version of Halloween wasn't nearly as rude, obnoxious, or as annoying at all, which made the Lynda character in this 2007 version of Halloween a very annoying character, plus Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell) dies off from Michael Myers in this HALLOWEEN flick, but Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) survives in the original by John Carpenter along with all the other HALLOWEEN installments.

Additionally, in John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN flick, Lynda(P.J. Soles) was having a good time humping around with her boyfriend(Bob)at a babysitters houses in someone else's bed, but in this Zombie HALLOWEEN flick, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) and her boyfriend(Bob) sneak into the vacant dumpy Myers house to do hubba hubba with some blankets on the floor instead, except Lynda doesn't end up having a good time with her boyfriend and not enjoying the sex with Bob at all and ends up putting Bob down instead of praising him or appreciating him and showing us a lot more nudity on Lynda instead of having Lynda and Bob enjoying the intimacy, unlike how it went for Lynda and her boyfriend in the original, since Lynda complimented her boyfriend in the 1978 version after Lynda and Bob have their orgasm by Lynda saying ""Oh Fantastic"" after Bob finishes boning Lynda, since Lynda and Bob obviously enjoyed the lovemaking in the original, especially before they got killed by Michael Myers not to mention that the characters who have premarital sex in these kind of terror flicks always seem to die off, but the survivors always seem to be virgins like Laurie for instance.

In addition to what helped screw this HALLOWEEN remake up by Rob Zombie was in the original 1978 flick of HALOWEEN by John Carpenter; Michael Myers killed his older sister(Judith Myers) at age 6 and then escapes from the institution 15 years later at age 21 to return to his hometown(Haddonfield, Illinois) to kill his kid sister(Laurie Strode), but in Zombie's 2007 remake; Michael kills his big sister(Hannah Hall), his stepfather(Bill Forsythe), and sisters boyfriend at age 10 instead of 6 and returns to Haddonfield to kill less than 15 years later.

This HALLOWEEN version also didn't even show the credits to the cast, crew, and credits at the beginning of this flick either, unlike the original HALLOWEEN done by John Carpenter.

Something else I noticed about this movie is in the scene just before Lynda(Kristina Klebe) dies off was for some reason they had censored out Kristina Klebe's coochie in this DVD, but in the movies they had actually shown Kristina Klebe's whole Womanhood with the 3B's Breast, Bush, Butt when Kristina Klebe(Lynda)was shown in full frontal nudity just before being killed off by Michael Myers.

All the actors and characters in this movie also acted very amateurish with abnormal potty mouths and bad attitudes, plus I didn't even care or sympathize for the characters Laurie(Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda(Kris Klebe), or Annie(Danielle Harris) in this movie either since they all seemed hardly likeable and a lot more immature and airheaded than Laurie(Jamie-Lee Curtis), Lynda(PJ Soles), and Annie(Nancy Loomis)were in the original HALLOWEEN by John Carpenter, which I had liked and sympathized for in that version, unlike Zombie's version.

Therefore I had zero sympathy for Judith Myers and Judiths boyfriend when Michael killed them after Judiths boyfriend finishes seducing her since Judith was rude and slutty looking in this HALLOWEEN version especially after Judith flaked out on taking Michael trick-or-treating to go upstairs to have sex in her bedroom instead which would make me almost fired up enough to want to do something like that who bowed out on me just so they could get laid.

In addition to why I had zero sympathy for all the victims who died off in this HALLOWEEN flick; Michael Myers came from a dysfunctional trashy family household with no manners like the Bundys on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, but in the original HALLOWEEN flick by John Carpenter from 1978, Michael came from a clean, sweet, honest, & typical family household like on LEAVE IT TO BEAVER which is why I sympathized for Judith Myers & most of Michaels other victims in the original HALLOWEEN since Michael was a lot less prompted by his victims to kill as opposed to this version.

So I agree with anybody who disapproves of this 2007 horror film and I agree with anyone who thinks Zombie did a terrible job with this revision of HALLOWEEN along with the fact that I expected Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick to be much better, but it wasn't even close to being as great as I had expected and I agree with anyone who felt the same way about Zombie's version of HALLOWEEN as opposed to John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece of HALLOWEEN.

So you could say Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, and Danielle Harris all tarnished the characters of Laurie, Annie, and Lynda.

So save your money and don't buy this DVD, but if you choose to watch it, just rent the movie or borrow it from a friend and it's almost as if this terror flick was overrated too.

Therefore, this HALLOWEEN by Rob Zombie bites the big one and the HALLOWEEN flick by John Carpenter is still the very best to this very day and always will be.

Therefore, this flick would've been better off if it had been titled something like HALLOWEEN 9: THE BEGINNING just like they did with the PSYCHO saga installments with PSYCHO 4:THE BEGINNING which tells us more about the story and untold story on Norman Bates and how he was before he went haywire and killed his own mother and customers who'd stay at the Bates Motel, which was similar to what Zombie did in this version, but since Zombie had revised Carpenter's version of HALLOWEEN and it wasn't as good or as authentic, this HALLOWEEN flick faltered instead making it even better than the original, but I think this flick would've been a little more successful if this movie would've been made as HALLOWEEN 9: THE BEGINING or something like that, since the purpose of Zombie's Halloween flick was to show and explain the untold story about Michael Myers and how he became the way he did and that Michael Myers actually had a human side to him that actually even talked, just like there was more to Norman Bates than we all knew that was revealed in PSYCHO IV:THE BEGINNING.

So for anyone who can prefer Zombie's version to Carpenter's version is way beyond me and is quite baffling and I agree with anybody who says Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick is a rip off, a waste of time, or insult to the original.

By the way, I just got word that Rob Zombie will be having his sequel to this movie released this Summer and that H2 will be released on Friday August 28th in theatres everywhere, but from the previews I've seen on its theatrical trailer online, H2 looks pretty cheesy and will probably be even cheesier than Zombie's HALLOWEEN 1 flick and will probably bite at the box office.",1200268800,4,8507,4.888349514563107
3179008,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie does a great job, actually I am not a fan of his previous movies but I love the original version of this movie so I wanted to see what rob zombie did to it. I love what he did with micheal meyers as a child, it makes you feel a little sorry for him and you kind of root for him. The one bad thing about this is the actor who played sam loomis in rob zombie's halloween did not do a very good job, his dialogue did not feel natural too me, it seemed kind of cumbersome.",1200096000,2,479,3.8
3179009,3,B000VKL6Z2,"As you can see from the title of this review, I called it ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"", because no matter how much resemblances there are between Zombie's and Carpenter's vision, both films are drastically different.  In other words, John Carpenter's is still a better film.

I'm not sure exactly what to think of this film. As much as I love Michael Myers, I really didn't need any story on how he actually became the killer he was.  The beauty of the original is that there was no motive for what he is doing.  He was raised in a nice, quiet neighborhood with his loving family.  When he snaps then, it makes it all the more terrifying and the audience questions why he does things he does.

In this version, his family are a bunch of grungy, profanity-spewing pigs.  They are not loving or caring (except for the mother) and in a way, we sympathize with Michael as a child.  Plus, the lead up to the killings, which start his path towards violence forever, is filled with Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"" playing in the background as Michael thinks about his Mom stripping at a club (Is this Halloween?  Am I watching a different movie?).  Anyway, it seems like Michael just gets bored on Halloween night and kills his family members.  There's no mystery whatsoever.  He just picks up a knife because he has nothing better to do.

Rob Zombie does a good job of moving the story along at a brisk pace, but that's also his downfall.  As soon as we're introduced to Laurie and her friends, they are killed 10 minutes after. Actually, a lot of people are introduced and then killed two seconds later. In the original, time (a lot of time) was spent on the girls and even though you may have been bored because of it, you at least cared when they were killed. Not so much here.

There were a few high points though. The direction by Zombie was pretty good and managed to get some good scares out of me.  Yet, I wanted more suspense-filled moments (no more of these jump scares) like the original.  There needed to be more stalking of the victims and less killing.

In the acting department, props to Scout Taylor-Compton, who I thought actually did BETTER than Jamie Lee Curtis. I know people are going to hate on me for that, but I found her much more believable and wanted her to live. Malcolm McDowell did an adequate job as Loomis, but he's no Donald Pleasance.  Some of his lines felt very forced and unintentionally funny.  Tyler Mane did a great job as Michael in my opinion.  Too bad that we had to see him as a child as it lessened the image of him.  Regardless, he was a brute, menacing, and had a great aura about him.

Overall, it was a good horror movie. I just wish more time was devoted to the victims than the actual killer. It would have made for a much better (and scarier) ride.",1200096000,,2782,4.433070866141732
3179010,4,B000VKL6Z2,"............unfortunately it is a remake of an already perfect horror movie, or else this would have easily been 5 star's.

Let me first start off by saying I thought this remake was extremely unnecessary, and I'm not a big fan of remake's in general, but if a classic movie like Halloween is going to be remade (which is innevitable in this day and age) I'm glad it was done by Zombie, he did a great job. Anyone else would have tore this masterpiece apart. Everything that plagued his first two movie's is completely gone here. The acting is definitely a step up from his previous flick's, he ditched the hand-cam for a steady-cam for most of the scene's, and all the effect's are good old fashoined prosthetic's and fake blood. The backstory on Michael Myers is done really well, and Daeg Faerchs' (little Michaels') performance is very good considering his age. It was also fun idea to think what Myers might have been like as a little boy. For most of the movie it is all backstory, and it is a completely different film than the original Halloween. I'm really glad he didn't just do a shot-for-shot remake, it's a preqeal/remake-hybrid which make's it very interesting. As unnecessary as it was, I enjoyed watching it, and I thought it was the most enjoyable Halloween film since Halloween 2. Recommended.",1200009600,,1311,4.724890829694323
3179011,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I loved Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (Not the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans!

HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psyschopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time? You gotta watch the movie to find out! If you love horror, remakes, and Rob Zombie's work, you'll love HALLOWEEN!!!",1200009600,,2205,4.712435233160622

3179013,2,B000VKL6Z2,"When I bought the Director's Cut I expected to basically get the same amazing film I saw in the theater, with some added action and more backstory. What I ended up with instead is a major disappointment. The original scene in which Michael escapes (one of the best scenes of the theatrical version) is now preceded by a horrific and very graphic rape scene, and the escape itself has been changed. What was a very dramatic, violent and destructive event is much less so, having been watered down to be almost PG-13 worthy.

Where was Udo Kier? I remember seeing him in the theatrical version but unless I blinked and missed him he was completely absent from the Director's Cut. There are several missing pieces, including some of the footage from the scene toward the end of the film in which Michael chases Boo (Laurie) through the house.

The special features (deleted scenes, etc.) are really good - I wonder why they weren't added to the Director's Cut when some of them were already present in the original version of the film?

The performances were all strong, the directing was excellent, and it was interesting to see the alternate ending and other features, but overall the film has lost it's initial impact due to too much tinkering.

Potential buyers would be better off buying the other two-disc set (the theatrical version) than this cut.",1199836800,5,1352,4.764957264957265
3179014,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Anyone who thinks this is the worst Halloween movie obviously hasn't seen Halloween 4 through 8. This movie is brilliant. It perfectly captures what made the original great and at the same time does its own thing and brings it to another level while not taking anything away from the original. It's impossible to even say whether one is better than other because they both bring something unique to the table and it never overdoes it with gore. There is a certain charm left to the original of course but thats what so great about it because I can still watch that if I want to and get enjoyment out of it. They compliment eachother rather than cancel eachother out. Not only is it one of the most satisfying and well made remakes but its probably the best horror remake too. Easily the best Halloween since the misunderstood third one. Some people just don't get the genius of Rob Zombie and probably never will. People complain that they changed things. But seriously, if you're not going to do anything with the material there's no point in doing a remake at all. You can do a shot by shot remake like Psycho and see where that goes. I think the fact that this completely polarized fans says a lot about how unique and clever this film is. Zombie took it and had a ball with it and those of us that got that appreciated this reimagining and tribute to the original. Yeah, they gave a bit more character development to Michael Myers and backstory but he is the star of the show and it surprisingly added to the effect rather than take away from it even though you might expect otherwise. Not that it matters but the new Laurie is much better to look at. People were ready to hate this movie before it even came out. Its a bias and a sad one at that. But they are the ones who will miss out. Whine and complain that they revamped a pretty good classic but you know what, take it or leave it but the original isn't going anywhere.  Also, if you were underwhelmed when you saw it in the movies, try the new cut. Bottom line: make up your mind but form your opinion and don't develop a bias beforehand based on nothing (don't listen to others' preconceived notions either for that matter) and you just might enjoy yourself. All in all this is a refreshing dose of real horror after the last few Halloween movies and considering where the horror franchise in general has been going lately.",1199750400,3,2386,4.43507972665148

This was a pretty entertaining movie on its own but comparing it to the origional? I gotta go with John Carpenters version. It was just chilling. This movie was more a Rob Zombie 'Devils Rejects' kind of white trash exploitation movie.,1199750400,2,405,4.486486486486487
3179016,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding. Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!

The casting for HALLOWEEN is also pure genius.  While all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and do a convincing job, Malcolm McDowell is especially effective in his brooding and eccentric interpretation of Dr. Samuel Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode almost makes die-hard fans of the original forget that Jamie Lee Curtis originated the role.  In addition, Daeg Faerch is genuinely frightening as the young Michael Myers, and Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie is quite good--arguably one of her best performances to date--as the white-trash mother of young Michael.

The DVD set here contains the theatrical version of the film, and thankfully, the disc offers the film in widescreen (a full-screen version is also offered, but why someone would actually want to watch it butchered like that is unfathomable). An Unrated Director's Cut is also available on DVD, but beware--it is far from the same film. Containing more than the usual ""restored footage"" that had to be cut in order to receive an ""R"" rating by the MPAA, the Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on that DVD a much weaker flick.

Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but if you want to see the work of genius for which he earned that praise, purchase the theatrical release offered here and avoid the Unrated Director's Cut.",1199750400,5,2076,5.148367952522255

For me it took to much of a left turn, it had no feel like the original Halloween.
It seems that people that make movies think movie goers like to listen to bad language, I thought that's what made the original Halloween unique is that there wasn't much bad language in it.
It's cool that ROB gave us a insight on how Michael became a serial killer, and the guy playing Michael is a giant.
This movie reminds me more of ""Friday the 13th"" or ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"".
Just to let you know now this movie has quite a few sex sense in it.
Don't!! start watching this movie thinking it's like the original Halloween.
I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!",1199664000,,728,4.170212765957447
3179018,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I was fairly excited to see this movie, I have always enjoyed the other Halloween movies in this series. The only suspicion I had was the fact Rob Zombie was the director, I was not much of a fan of his other work. That being said, this movie is just mediocre.  It isn't so bad; it isn't that good.

Whatever little character development attempted failed miserably. The story of Michael Myers is nothing unexpected. (In not ruining too much) He came from a chaotic family with less than amiable family members. That's all you really get from his family. Zombie spends a decent amount of time predicating  Myers' personality, which is to show he has none whatsoever (which is a little odd if you think about it, considering the situation he's already in). So you won't get much in regards to character essence.

And now to the best part--or in fact, not the best part at all: the killing scenes. It doesn't necessarily concern me if this is in the ""thriller"" or ""horror"" genre because this movie includes neither element. People dying doesn't make such a movie, lots of people die in Braveheart, yet that movie yields neither such class. Zombie must have really missed out here. Just because someone wears a mask whilst carnage is in the works doesn't make it scary. There are no jump-in-your-seat shocking killings. There are no killings which are that horrific. Like I said, every killing scene is predictable, because you know for a FACT Michael is already there. Know those feelings you got watching the Friday the 13th movies, where you just knew that person was going to die, and somehow doesn't because the killer wasn't actually there or her boyfriend jumps out instead? None of those either. V e r y  P r e d i c t a b l e.

Mediocre. Shallow. Predictable. These are the words I chose to describe this movie. But, if you have a night where you don't really have much to do and your friend was kind enough to have purchases this movie and wouldn't mind lending it to you, it's snowing outside and nobody in their right mind would think about going outside, you have a cup of coffee and a blanket, this movie is worth watching.

3179019,2,B000VKL6Z2,"With the release of ""Halloween"" in 1978, director John Carpenter introduced audiences to one of cinema history's most classic villains, Michael Myers, and ushered in the era of the slasher film. Even though his film was not all that much of a slasher film, in fact it was more of a thriller, the many sequels, and countless other film series', which were spawned from it were much more in the vein of slashers. Skip forward to 2007, after 7 sequels, some good and some not so much, the `Halloween' film series seemed to have run its course, so it must have appeared to some in Hollywood that the only options left for this franchise were to, A) let it die (which would have been fine and should have happened after ""Halloween: H20""), B) continue making pointless sequel after sequel that would most likely wind up going straight to DVD shelves (case in point, the `Hellraiser' series), or C) remake/reimagine the franchise. Apparently option C seemed the most viable, as musician/director/writer Rob Zombie (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") was tapped to helm this new incarnation of Michael Myers with his remake of the original film, simply titled ""Halloween"".

""Halloween"" is partly a remake of the John Carpenter original film from 1978, but is also an origin story for Michael Myers (this time played by Tyler Mane), giving viewers some insight into what caused Michael to become the monster that he is. Michael Myers seemed like a fairly normal 10-year-old kid, but appearances can often be deceiving. Behind his seemingly innocent faade was a cold-blooded killer, he just hadn't manifested himself fully yet. Then one Halloween night, Michael suddenly unleashes his dark side and kills his stepfather, older sister and her boyfriend, leaving only his mother and younger sister, Laurie alive. After the grisly murders, Michael is locked away in a psychiatric hospital where he meets his longtime doctor Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), and begins to fall even further into the abyss of his murderous psychosis. Fast forward 15 years, and Michael suddenly decides it is time to escape the hospital that has served as his prison for so long, and return to the town where his rampage began and to finish what he started by killing his only remaining family member, his younger sister that he had spared all those years ago.

The choice of Rob Zombie as director/writer for the new film didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me. Sure, the franchise had kind of wandered into the typical slasher subgenre of horror films, but Zombie's brand of horror was much more extreme and gratuitous than anything contained within this film series. However, when the film was released and began receiving some praise for the reinterpretation of the original classic, I thought maybe Rob Zombie had managed to make a more mainstream, and better film instead of his demented crop of horror films that he'd been crafting over the last couple of years. So, when I rented the film I approached it openly, and had hopes that it would be a good film, that could possibly equal the original (which should always be the goal for any remake), and if nothing else give an interesting origin story to the character of Michael. Upon watching the film, I soon realized, after getting about 30 minutes into the movie, that this film though not a typical Rob Zombie movie, it did contain most of the familiar elements that he loves to include in his films, i.e. plenty of language, graphic nudity, disturbing images, and extreme violence. Basically, Rob was making a more toned down film than usual, but in the end it didn't really feel like it was all that much of a `Halloween' film, as it seemed to still fit more in line with Zombie's previous two disturbing pieces of cinema, than with the series it was supposedly paying homage to while trying to breathe new life into the character.

The story, as I stated earlier, is a mixture of origin tale and remake all rolled into one film. The first half of the film is devoted to the early years of Michael Myers, essentially expanding on the opening moments from the original movie. This portion of the movie was somewhat interesting because it was showcasing a different time in the life of this villain, and also giving some clues as to why he became this killer. But, this new origin seemed to contradict the opening of the original film, because here Michael's family is painted as broken and abusive, whereas in the original he appeared to have come from a loving home and he simply snapped one day. Having Michael come from such an abusive upbringing served as a way of explaining why he killed some members of his family, mainly the ones who mistreated him the most, but it also seemed like an attempt on Zombie's part to humanize Michael and to try to get the audience to feel some semblance of sympathy for the character. This is where I feel the movie made a big mistake; the film is about Michael Myers, one of the most dreaded villains in cinema, I for one do not want to be made to feel sorry for this character. Why should we as an audience be sympathetic to him, why not just show him as a kid who suddenly snapped, committed a horrible crime, and then show how he slipped further into psychosis while in the mental hospital. That is what I thought this movie was going to do, and to an extent it did, but it also seemed to go to great lengths to create sympathy, which should not have happened. Once Michael is committed to the institution the movie seems to gain momentum, and these are some of the most fascinating scenes in the movie, and I thought that Rob Zombie actually did a good job of showing the character's gradual descent into madness, and he also used this as an opportunity to explore why Michael always wears a mask, which was a surprising addition to the story.

The second half of the film, is basically a rehash of the original film with some changes made to certain events, but it is pretty much the first movie condensed into one hour. This portion of the movie works on some levels, I liked some of the changes that Rob made to the original film, but it was also nice to see that even after all these years some aspects of the original movie are just too good to change, and should just be redone similar to how they were before. However, as good as parts of this section of the movie was, they were overshadowed by Rob Zombie's penchant for blood, gore, and gratuitous nudity, all of which took away from not just this portion of the film, but the entire movie as well since all of these components were sprinkled throughout.

The actors in this film were all decent; those playing the various teenagers were average at best. Their performances for the most part were fairly by the book, and therefore their characters were pretty much forgettable, not a single one of them contained even an ounce of the screen presence of Jamie Lee Curtis. Her performance in the original film is part of what made that film so successful, she was so sweet and innocent, and Jamie played her so naturally that you couldn't help but invest in her as a character. But the ones here were pretty much standard horror film fare, no real standouts just a bunch of unknowns trying to make a break, but none of them deliver anything resembling a memorable performance. The highlight of the cast was Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, the role made famous by the late Donald Pleasance. Malcolm plays Loomis as a caring child psychologist who desperately wants to reach Michael in hopes of finding some good in him, and when he realizes that this can't happen it breaks his heart. So when Michael escapes, Loomis comes after him with such zeal that it seems borderline obsessive. McDowell is fun to watch as Dr. Loomis, and steals every scene that he is in, and convincingly takes the doctor from being a man who cares for this young boy as merely a patient to being a man obsessed with stopping this monster who he feels responsible for because of his failure to reach him. It was a new angle to view the character from and one that Malcolm did an exceptional job handling.

In the end, ""Halloween"" is a major letdown of a remake. It fails to even come close to capturing what made the original film so good, and I think a majority of the blame must be laid on the shoulders of the film's writer/director Rob Zombie. His talents as a screenwriter and director are average at best, definitely not worthy of big screen feature films, his films seem more at home in the Direct-to-DVD marketplace. Even if you are a fan of Rob Zombie's work in movies, I believe that even you fans have got to admit that his adaptation of ""Halloween"" is nowhere near good enough to hold a candle to John Carpenter's original classic that started it all.

""Halloween"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both containing graphic violence, language, nudity/sexuality, and gore.",1199404800,2,8921,4.656725888324873
3179020,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie has done a very good job in remaking one of horror's most classic films.  Seldom do remakes live up to the original, but this scary film comes very close and adds in some extras along the way.

Unlike the original Halloween, Zombie's version starts out with the entire Myers family.  Young Michael (Daeg Faerch) is constantly tormented by other children at school.  They make fun of his stripper mom Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) and his promiscuous sister. Deborah's slob of a boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe) spends his days lying on the couch and hurling insults at the rest of the family.  The only person that Michael is somewhat close to is his baby sister.

One day, the tormenting from the other children goes too far, and Michael snaps.  One child is killed, and Michael then kills his sister, her boyfriend, and Ronnie on Halloween night.  His mother finds him holding his baby sister on the steps outside the house.

Michael is put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to a mental hospital.  At the hospital, Michael is placed under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  At first, Dr. Loomis sees Michael as a troubled child who has no recollection of what he has done.  He longs to go home to be with his mother.  But, as time passes, Michael slips deeper and deeper into a shell.  He begins wearing masks constantly and soon, he snaps again.  More people are killed, Michael escapes, and he heads back to Haddonfield to claim his last victim; his young sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who was adopted after Michael's earlier killing spree.

The events after this point unfold pretty much the same as they did in John Carpenter's original Halloween.  There are some subtle differences but, for the most part, Zombie follows the original very closely until the end, which is very different from the original.

I am a big fan of Carpenter's Halloween movies, and I was anxious to see how this version compared to the earlier ones.  I was very impressed with Zombie's film.  What I liked most about this movie was the look into Michael Myers' early life and how he became the madman he turned out to be.  Unlike the beginning of Carpenter's film, where the viewer only sees Michael killing his sister, Zombie spends almost an hour of film time setting the stage for Michael's slide from a troubled child to maniacal killer.  He also makes the viewer feel somewhat sympathetic for Michael, due to his troubled upbringing by a mom who works as a stripper and a deadbeat boyfriend.

I recommend this movie very highly.  Rob Zombie has taken a classic horror film and reworked it in such a way as to make it almost better than the original.  I still prefer Carpenter's version over Zombie's, but this scary movie is definitely worth watching.",1199404800,4,2798,4.755186721991701

3179022,1,B000VKL6Z2,"I would like to start by saying that I love horror films. Halloween is a classic - however, what made it a classic for so many of us was the fact that we had no connection with why Michael is the way he is. His family life appeared to be somewhat picture perfect and yet that sweet innocent looking little boy in a clown suit was to be a psychotic killer.

Enter Rob Zombie. Now the film is full of reasoning. His abusive stepfather, his stripper mother, being bullied at school and his connection with masks. The fear of the original comes from the 'unknown'.

I enjoy the horror genre, the blood, the chase, the violence and the scares. Why is Zombie so in tune with half naked women crawling along on all fours and being stabbed from behind? Lastly, 'cause I can bare no more to talk about this film....as my best friend says, ""What is with the Extreme Makeover Home Edition at the end?!"".

Myers has definitely left the building.",1199318400,,933,4.412790697674419
3179023,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Weird that I would live to see the days where you could say that the original ""Halloween"" and yes even ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" acheieved more with less when at the time they were accused of graphic excess. Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"", surely blows out of the water all the pointless sequels in between and has his own unique touches (including his usual southern countrified hellbent revenge types and period soundtrack music plus his over the top mind numbing hallucinatory violence)but unlike the original ""Halloween"", none of the characters are sympathetic and are close to stereotypes and the comedic elements seem out of place (though the suspense and entertainment don't cease) and though obviously intended as a tribute to the original in parts also seems to parody it, which taken by today's standards seems almost wholesome (a metaphor of small town America fighting an out of control menace) and Rob Zombie's take is a full frontal assault on the senses. I do find it interesting to examine the life of Michael Myers as a child and expand on that brief part in the original film though the idea of it as even close to a ""case study"" is ridiculous. Some people who have been through mental hospitals actually are not deranged killers. Some recover and some even write Amazon reviews (including yours truly). As Loomis would say ""that is a scary thought indeed"". In brief, a relatively sincere effort to remake a classic and certainly, light years above Gus Van Sant's remake of ""Psycho"" but not up to the standards of Rob Zombie's genre bending classics ""The Devils's Reject's"" and ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". Watch the original first and then this out of curiousity as it is filled with too many elements and goes in too many directions to make it quite a success.",1199232000,3,1781,4.8618421052631575
3179024,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This review is on the long side, but please just bare with me.

Halloween just might be the most controversial horror remake of all time; when it was announced as a remake with Rob Zombie directing a lot of people were for it and a lot of people were against it. While I wasn't happy Halloween was being remade I also looked forward to it. I feel the last couple of installments were rather weak. Even though I do enjoy 2-5, it's all been downhill after the classic original. Also being a fan of Rob Zombie got me interested.

The series though needed something to get back on track and I hoped this would be the movie to get things going. I know a lot of people were upset that the series wouldn't get closure now. But does it really matter? This series has so many loose ends to begin with. The unfairly bashed Halloween 3 has nothing to do with the previous 2 or anything afterwards so that will never be wrapped up. Halloween 4-6 were ignored come H20 and Resurrection. So no matter what this series would never get closure. And honestly after Halloween: Resurrection this franchise was in much need of a resurrection.

Adding a back-story is something that can be very tough to work and that is what really made me nervous and when I heard it was the first half of the movie I got even more nervous. This may be a remake, but let's face it most people will still see this as the 9th Halloween movie. The funny thing is I happen to think the first half was the strongest of the movie and I know a lot of people felt that way. Even those who hated the movie, a lot of the times say the first half was better. The backstory here is far, far better than the lame curse of thorn. The first half was an interesting character study of a very disturbed boy.

The screenplay by Rob Zombie was very uneven; most of his ideas play out well, but there are some cringe worthy moments. The first 10-minutes or so features some weak writing. But as a fan of this genre the writing is often the weakest part and none of the Halloween movies had great screenplays. Yes even the original; the script really wasn't all that great. The reason Halloween is the masterpiece it is, is simply because of the strong lead performances and Carpenter's directing and music. In Halloween 07 most of the poor dialogue is from Ronnie White played by the very cool William Forsythe. His dialogue is terrible and his performance is border-line of a parody. His character is entertaining, but the biggest flaw with the first half. But the good is any scene with Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and young Michael played by Daeg Faerch. Also the scenes withy young Michael and Deborah Myers played by Sheri Moon Zombie also works very well.

The Loomis and Michael scenes actually come out well, and it was quite interesting to see Loomis actually trying to reach Michael and help him. In the original we never see Loomis working with young Michael, which is fine. That wasn't the point of the original, but it is interesting seeing Loomis trying to reach Michael. I found their relationship the strongest part of Halloween 07. In the original as well as the sequels Loomis is out to stop Michael no matter what. Even if it means giving his own life; when Loomis first comes across Michael at the end in the original his first reaction was shoot to kill. In Halloween 07 Loomis though tries to reach Michael first and if that doesn't work than shoot to kill. The scenes with Loomis and Michael are well written and acted and play out very well overall. Daeg Faerch does an excellent job as young Michael.

Some people dislike the backstory, but it was for the most part well done some people disliked the fact Michael was given a motive. I don't think that was the case. Michael was a disturbed boy who was bound to snap sooner or later. His home life just made him snap sooner. But the things he does as a child and later as an adult isn't something people do unless they are very disturbed.

The first half actually works well despite some weak writing at times; the performances were mostly good with Sheri Moon Zombie being the stand-out; I do think Zombie has a slight problem writing for normal characters, but he does a great job with Deborah Myers. She was likeable and very sympathetic. I do think though the screenplay could have used a touch up in the first half, but Zombie keeps the pace moving at a solid pace and makes up for any shortcomings.

The problem with the 2nd half is basically 80-minutes of the original crammed into about an hour. The pacing is the biggest problem; characters are introduced for a scene or two and are killed off right away. There is very little getting to know them. There are moments where it does sort of become a rehash of the original, but it still works well. No doubt it's not as suspenseful and scary as the original, but Zombie's scenes do work well overall.

With Halloween, the problem of writing for normal characters is still there for Zombie. None of the characters were really all that likeable outside of maybe Ismael Cruz played by Danny Trejo. The Strode family was Rob's attempt at writing normal characters, but the problem is they come across as really weird. It's like those people who get older, but yet try and act like they are down with the youth they always seem weird. Pat Skipper does a good job as Mason Strode as does Dee Wallace as Cynthia. Both characters are likeable though, but just come across as a little weird. Their deaths though are very brutal and work really well.

Scout Taylor-Compton does an excellent job as Laurie Strode, but her character was just not fully developed, but than again the point of Halloween 07 was to focus more on Michael Myers. It was his story where as the original was Laurie's story. Scout gets some heat, but she was one of the bright spots of the movie. Some people say she wasn't likeable and was too mean to Tommy Doyal played by Skyler Gisondo. I have to disagree; the scenes with her and Tommy and than later with Lindsey played by Jenny Gregg Stewart are the strongest scenes in the 2nd half. She wasn't being mean to them they have brother/sister kind of relationship and it worked quite well. Zombie is getting better at writing for normal characters. His first two were all about the villains, and here the main focus is the villain, but he does do better with the normal characters, than he did in Corpses and Rejects. But The Devil's Rejects is still by far his best movie thus far.

By the time Laurie enters the movie there is about an hour left and there was no way all these characters plus Laurie could be fully developed without slowing down the pace. This Laurie isn't the repressed virgin Jamie Lee's Laurie was. Scout's Laurie was a nice girl with an edge to her. But her first scene was very weird and that shows Zombie needs more work on normal characters. By the time Laurie came into play developing her too much would have slowed the pace down a lot. And at this point you gotta keep moving forward. There was potential with the Laurie character, but despite not being fully developed I do think the character was likeable.

Some people complain about the lack of screen time for Lynda played by Kristina Klebe and Annie played by Danielle Harris making her big return to the Halloween series. If you go back and view the original Halloween, Lynda actually doesn't have a lot of screen time. Difference is her part is spread out more through the picture, where as here it's not. Though it does seem like Annie may have had less screen time than the original Annie did; both girls though play their roles well. They weren't all that likeable in general, but they both provide solid performances.

I think the writing for Laurie, Lynda and Annie was good and bad. They do come across like teenagers in the things they say and do. Not all teens are like that, but a lot of them are. But they just lacked depth. But as much as I love the original there was some weak writing and Lynda had the weakest of lines. Lynda in the remake is no more developed, but in some ways she actually is. Prior to her death when she talks to Laurie on the phone does add a little bit of depth to Lynda. Her tough girl act is just that an act. Zombie's screenplay was very mixed, but there is some potential there for him as a writer with normal characters.

Tyler Mane I thought did a great job as Michael Myers. To be honest I would rate him 2nd to only Nick Castle of the original. If the original Michael was the incarnation of evil, this Michael is the incarnation of rage. Despite his size he's still stealthy. The scene when he stands behind Lindsey Wallace as she watches TV is a very creepy moment. Tyler's Michael and Nick Castle's Michael are very much a like, but very different. But I really loved Tyler's performance.

The good and bad of the backstory is simple. We get to know Michael so well it does sort of take away the boogeyman element. But it also brings a human side to Michael and makes him feel so much more real. I'll admit the 2nd half had some creepy moments thanks to Tyler's movements and the fact we knew Michael more makes him seem real. In the sequels he became too much of an un-killable monster. Like the original, this is the most human Michael has ever been. In the original Michael was just pure evil, he was the shape of evil in a man. But he felt like a real person. And while he kept coming back an excuse can be made for why he survived what he did. Zombie goes back to that in a sense. Again this is the most human Michael has been in a while.

What I liked about Tyler Mane was his eyes show nothing. And what I mean by that they show no remorse. He has this empty look. The person inside of him is dead and just evil has taken over his body. Having such a big Michael may not have been the smartest move, but it works out great as Tyler Mane gives it his all and makes a great Michael. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Dr. Loomis, though nobody can ever top Pleasence. My only problem with McDowell is sometimes he comes across as a bit shady. The major problem is a lot of his scenes in the 2nd half with Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is a rehash of the original just worded slightly different.

Some people complain about the violence, but I thought it was done in a great way. The one thing Rob Zombie really has going for him as a filmmaker is he knows how to shoot a brutal death scene. His love of exploitation cinema serves him well with the deaths. The victims try and fight back and put more of a struggle up. The scene with Michael dragging away a topless Annie is a very creepy moment. And when Laurie finds her later on it's actually quite chilling. This is probably the most violent Halloween, but it does work well since it's very raw and real. As a director despite some pacing problems Rob Zombie is able to keep things moving forward and like him or not there was a story and I personally enjoyed it.

Not everybody will like this flick, but I can't help but feel a lot of the hate stems from it being a remake. I saw a lot of negative reviews from people who never even have seen this and I read a lot of negative stuff before the movie was even shot. Liking the remake doesn't make you any less of a fan of the original and Halloween 07 will never replace the original. I don't get that so many people are willing to accept the sequels, but dismiss the remake before even viewing it.

Make no mistake Halloween 07 isn't a perfect film and not as good as the original. But it does deliver some suspense and scares. I would rate Halloween 07 as the 2nd best of the series only behind the original. I didn't like Halloween 07 at first, but now I've come to love it. Give it a chance and just forget it's a remake and enjoy the ride.",1199232000,3,11788,4.3818015546410605
3179025,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I did like how Rob Zombie made this remake very different from the original 1978 masterpiece of horror. Most horror film remakes today are the exact same film with bigger production values and zero horror. At least Rob made something totally fresh, though it has many flaws. I liked Michael Myers much better when I knew nothing about him. Now he is given a more realistic abused past and thus makes him human. Big mistake. The acting is decent enough for a horror film, but even the original wasn't the best acted film, so I can't really knock this one too much in that department. I think this is the third best film in the Halloween series after Halloween and Halloween II. Hallween 4 was okay, but all the rest aren't worth watching.",1199232000,3,737,4.548872180451128

3179028,4,B000VKL6Z2,"While not perfect, Rob Zombie's take on 'Halloween' is unquestionably the most enjoyable entry in the long-running series since the 1978 original. That's probably because it pretty much is the original, with a few new twists, and a backstory which offers a look at the childhood of Michael Myers. As is the norm with a Rob Zombie film, it's also very gory and violent at times, but not when you compare it to his other directorial efforts, 'House Of 1,000 Corpses' and 'The Devil's Rejects'.

Zombie's best decision in this ""re-imagining"" is to make Michael Myers vicious again. In too many of the inferior previous sequels, Myers is more like Frankenstein's monster, moving in slow motion. Here, he's far more energetic, and in one climactic scene, even runs at his intended victim. Tyler Mane, a former professional wrestler who played Sabretooth in the first 'X-Men' film, brings a physical presence in the role of Michael Myers; he's a towering menace. Zombie also uses most of his cast from his other two films, though the scene in the theatrical version in which most of them appear has been cut from this unrated version. Also, big kudos to Zombie for bringing Danielle Harris back into the fold, as she was the little girl in the fourth and fifth 'Halloween' sequels. She's all grown up now, and probably closer to 30 than the 18 year old she plays in the film, but she does just fine with the screen time she has. Finally, Scout Taylor-Compton has the daunting task of playing Laurie Strode, the role which made Jamie Lee Curtis famous all the way back in 1978. Taylor-Compton certainly is cute, but she can't quite pull off as convincing a performance on the same level as Curtis. Not that it's bad, but it's just not as memorable. Same goes for Malcolm McDowell, who steps into the big shoes of the late Donald Pleasence as Dr. Samuel Loomis.

Nonetheless, this film is surprisingly much more fun than any prior installment, with the exception of the original. Actually, some of this film is an improvement on the classic 'Halloween', because Zombie is generally faithful to the source material, right down to the characters' names. Even the famous score by John Carpenter is well reproduced by Tyler Bates. This is Zombie's best effort so far, and while the conclusion of this 'Halloween' seems to indicate that it's the final go-round for Michael Myers, I'd be happy to have Zombie do another sequel, if he wanted to.

Recommended, but be warned, some of the violence is brutal in this unrated version; opt for the theatrical version otherwise.",1198972800,4,2557,4.806818181818182
3179029,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I went into this movie with doubts-never a good sign -but the movie had some luck going for it because I was told by a few people how bad it is and this is usually the opposite kiss of death reaction -you know the one where someone tells you ""you'll love this movie"" right then you know you never will--turns out  that the people who told me it was awful have steered me wrong in the past.. sometimes enough to ask them ""what the hell where you on when you saw this movie? Because you clearly saw a different movie than I did.."" so I usually take that as good sign omen, what have you..
Now Ol' Rob has made only 2 other movies before he ventured into re-make  world. .and they were both sort of maverick originals. House of  1000 Corpses he pulled out all the stops and used every influence from 70's horror Texas Chainsaw Massacre( you know,, the good one),Hills Have Eyes, Deranged, aww hell all of them... and then he stepped back just a tad with the Devil's Rejects ..using the same characters but about halfway thru that movie something happened to its style and idea, and it changed , took a turn for the worst and had me wanting to leave the theatre
So as one can see it was not easy for me to wrap my brain around any UN preconceived notions about Rob Zombie's Halloween so I went in expecting perhaps an excruciating time  and guess what? I kinda liked it.
Now it goes ahead and takes a buncha artistic license like having the first half be the ""how Micheal Myers got that way "" saga but William Forsythe RULES and he didn't disappoint as the abusive drunken white trash step dad.. and Rob's wife Sherri Moon was surprisingly cool as the burdened stripper mom.. I know it won't sound like it but it was a stretch from her 2 previous ultra psycho-bitch-kitty roles. And the pudgy scary kid with the long hair as the young  fat kid Micheal was creepy. .but let's just note here that you cannot I repeat CANNOT beat some one to death with a tree branch sorry... and then there's Malcolm Mcdowell taking over the Donald Pleasance role...leaving me to once again say to myself what the hell happened to Malcolm Mcdowell? I mean there was time when he s ummmm GOOD! Well he wasn't so bad in  this anyone who watches the original again will notice that the dr.  Samuel Loomis role doesn't do much  the entire movie except stand around in wind bristled trees ..
Ok so the violence was good, gore was good, the fun part of seeing all kinds of character actors popping up including Mickey Dolenz-yes the one from the Monkees and the entire Zombie repertory theatre company of Sid Haig, Bill Mosely, Danny Trejo,Tom Towles,et all I really liked spotting Richard Lynch, Clint Howard,(Ron's bro) the gratuitous Udo Kier,and even the always excellent ""no matter what piece of crap I am in these days "" Brad Dourif as the sheriff
The second half of the movie stays pretty true to the original but it also has to be done in half the time so--when things look like they might plod..??? another brutal killing and brutal they are.. way into the bludgeoning factor in this one...but the ol' knife slashing complete with the new chunk and drip noise that accompanies all good horror blood lettings theses days is  no slouch either-- all the hot teenage babysitting chicks and their dialogue was I bet you word for to the original just not as much and that is a good thing because a lot of the jibber jabber in the first one is just filler because you know the psycho killer is out there SOMEWHERE in his William Shatner mask ready to strike.. I think that Rob tried to stay pretty faithful but with the high-tech of todays movies a slow story like this does need a bit more action not just extra violence and just like with a good cover song its better to take the original idea and bend it to your own creative interpretation and Zombie's case he shoulda twisted it all over the place and made it more of the psychedelic messes he is so fond of.",1198886400,2,3936,4.410468319559229
3179030,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I found this remake of John Carpenters classic to be one of the best films of the year. It was both revelutionary with its inclusion of Michael Myers back story, a more intimidating physical presence from the Myers character and finally he is no longer an invicible killing machine of the Vorhee's/Crougar variety but a much more terrifying 'human being' who happens to be both psychotic and immensely strong. I was also elated to find the original story intact and much more importantly the original score. BEST SCORE EVER!",1198886400,,524,4.898876404494382
3179031,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I thought Rob's take on Halloween and Michael Myers was excellent. The first half of the film was the most interesting part, as it describes Michaels background, his hellish family, and what eventually triggered his killing spree. It doesn't explain *why* he did it and it doesn't treat him with any particular symphaty. It's just a cold and raw description of his upbringing, much more realistic and gruesome than anything from Carpenter's original film. Michael ends up in a cell, he breaks out, and after that, it's unfortunately pretty much business as usual for a Halloween film.

I say unfortunately, because the film works best when Rob follows his own vision and I thought it was annoying when he tried to keep the Halloween traditionalists happy by including the Captain Kirk mask, the jump suit, the corny ""sheet over the head"" gag, etc. The first half of the film is so realistic that these pointless silly details ruin the overall impression and atmosphere. There's no real reason for Michael to put on the Captain Kirk mask or the jump suit, other than that the fans demands it. Michael does his own masks, as shown by the chilling scene from his cell, where the walls are covered with them. And Michael would *never* waste time by putting a sheet over his head, when there's killing to be done.

These leftovers from the original film should have been canned, even if it would have made the fans angry, because let's face it, the hardcore fans were *always* going to hate this, no matter how good it was.",1198886400,2,1518,4.724528301886792
3179032,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The original ""Halloween"" from 1978 was a great horror flick, a classic that hasn't been topped by any of the numerous sequels and clones that have followed. So what is there to do besides making another pointless sequel? Do a remake. And that's exactly what writer/director Rob Zombie did by redoing a new take on the horror classic. This time around Zombie decided to go back to the series' roots by showing new stuff that wasn't featured in the original. For example, we saw Michael Myers as a child killing his older sister in the first five minutes of the original film. At the beginning of this new movie, this time we see more of Michael as a child and how he slowly begins to turn to the dark side as he begins his killing spree on Halloween. The midway point of the film shows more scenes of Michael at the mental sanitarium, which of course he eventually breaks out of. And the last half features Michael heading back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois.

I haven't seen Rob Zombie's two previous movies (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") so going into this new ""Halloween"" movie I had no idea what kind of films this guy made. And judging by the opening scenes, I thought I was going to hate this film. We're not only introduced to Michael Myers as a kid, but we're also introduced to his family, and a happy family it ain't. The other members of the Myers household are Michael's mother Deborah, who works as a stripper; Michael's sister Judith, who's a sex-obsessed slut; and Michael's mother's boyfriend Ronnie, who's an abusive jerk. Oh and I almost forgot, there's Michael's baby sister, who will grow up to be Laurie Strode. These beginning scenes are so downright ugly that I found myself laughing at what was going on. This is true of that kitchen scene where Deborah and Ronnie are arguing and Ronnie loud angry tone causes Michael's baby sister to start crying not once, not twice, but three times! But then a funny thing happened while I was watching. The movie started to get interesting and I found myself more involved with the backstory of Michael Myers. The first half of the movie works best because it's the part that we hadn't really seen before in the earlier ""Halloween"" films, while the second half is more familiar territory as Michael (after breaking out of the sanitarium) returns to Haddonfield to claim his sister who's now grown up, and will kill anyone who gets in his way.

I was very surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did. It's one of the better horror movie remakes to come out of Hollywood recently, and there have been a lot of horror movie remakes. In the past couple of years we have seen remakes to hit horror movies from the '70s and '80s such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Fog"", ""When a Stranger Calls"", and ""The Hills Have Eyes"". And I'm sure there will be more remakes to come (""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" will probably be next). In my opinion, the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake from 2004 is still the best of all of these films. The ""Halloween"" remake from this year follows in second place. Sure Rob Zombie has made a movie that some people will probably describe as trashy. It's graphically violent, very profane, and contains a lot of sexuality/nudity. It's far more violent, profane, and sexual than the original John Carpenter film. But Zombie directs the film with a unique blend of stylishness that I found to be interesting. Plus, he gets some good performances from his cast of actors.

There are four performances here that stand out. Malcolm McDowell takes over the role of Dr. Sam Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence in the earlier films), and plays the character differently this time out. In the other ""Halloween"" films, there were times it seemed that the Dr. Loomis character was crazier than Michael Myers (that was especially true in the awful fifth movie). But McDowell plays Dr. Loomis as someone who doesn't act crazy. He's pretty sane, and wants nothing more that to stop the terror that's happening around him. His performance here is pretty good. The best performances are turned in by Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob Zombie's wife in real life) as Michael's mother, and young Daeg Faerch as the 10 year old Michael Myers. I found myself actually caring for these two individuals, and their relationship was very touching despite the evil that lurks around them. And newcomer Scout Taylor-Compton is very good as the new Laurie Strode. She might not top Jamie Lee Curtis, but she's still very effective in the role here. This time out Laurie isn't as uptight as she was in the original. She has some spunk, and I thought that was refreshing. Plus there's some good work done by Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" movies) as Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett, Danielle Harris (who played Jamie Lloyd in ""Halloween 4"" and ""Halloween 5"") as Laurie's friend Annie, who's also the sheriff's daughter, and Dee Wallace (the mother from ""E.T."" and ""Cujo"") as Laurie's adoptive mother Cynthia.

I did have a few quibbles with this film. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters earlier this year, and after seeing the unrated version on DVD noticed a few differences. For example, the scene where Michael breaks out of the sanitarium is completely different in the unrated version than it was in the theatrical version. Surprisingly, that alternate scene that played in the theatrical version isn't even featured in the DVD extras of this movie. And to tell you the truth, I was a little disappointed by that because I thought the breakout scene that was featured in the theatrical version was better and more effective. The new scene that's featured in the unrated version has a rape sequence that is quite nasty, and I'm guessing Zombie changed it for the theatrical version because if he had put in that scene for the theatrical version, the movie would have gotten an NC-17 rating. I wish Zombie had left that breakout scene the way it was in the theatrical version.

Nevertheless, the 2007 remake of ""Halloween"" is still a pretty good one. And the DVD extras are excellent. The bloopers are hilarious, there are plenty of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, casting sessions for many of the young actors who appear in the film, and a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie (which appears in different parts). All-in-all a decent remake.",1198886400,2,6444,4.709219858156028

Among other things, the scene in which Michael escapes is completely different from the theatrical version and now contains what feels like brutality for the sake of brutality -- considering the fact that I don't feel this way about any of the scenes in Zombie's previous films, that's saying a lot. It truly pains me to say these things about one of my favorite directors. I loved this film when I saw it in the theater and still love the first portion of the film which features Michael as a child, but I'm sorry to say that Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut won't be added to my rotation of comfort movies.",1198800000,2,679,4.483870967741935

Maybe I am just a big fan of the original but I still tried to give this movie a chance being a Rob Zombie fan and all. I loved house of 1000 Corpses but did not care for Devil's Rejects. I honestly liked the fact that you did not go into Michael's childhood. Thats what made him mysterious. We saw enough in the original to know he was not white trash so I did not get that. This movie spent to much time on his childhood for my taste. To many sex scenes and I don't dig rape scenes. I don't even understand the point of adding that into the movie. Also such bad acting. People seem to forget that the original was an Indie movie with no high priced actors or props just great scenes that scared you until the end. Zombie had enough money to do a good job and he did not. Hail to John Carpenter still the KING! I hated it and I always will.,1198800000,8,977,3.8656716417910446
3179037,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I must have watched this film about three times for no other reason then to decide if I liked it or not.  I was really that on the fence about it.  Final verdict is in and I feel that, although this is admittedly Zombie's best work and there is several kudos to be handed out; ultimately, the film fails.

'Halloween' can really be split pretty evenly into two halves.  The first of which is a brand new origin-story for Myers.  Granted, it's a little clichd and basically the same white-trash Olympics that Zombie seems to be fixated on.  At the same time though, it's really not bad and I bought into it.  The real standout here is Zombie's real-life wife (Sherri-Moon Zombie) who does a FANTASTIC job of portraying the tragedy of a mother who just can't seem to piece her life back together after Michael snaps.

I liked Malcolm McDowell here quite a bit as well.  I've read some pretty heavy criticism of the way he approached the 'Loomis' character, however, I like his approach a little better then (God forgive me for saying this) Donald Pleasance's take.  I always saw Pleasance's 'Loomis' as just some nut that shows up screaming ""He's evil!"" while shooting a couple of rounds in the air.

The real problem is, it's the very existence of this back-story that ultimately betrays the original concept of Myers in the first place.  In the original, and in most of John Carpenter's early films, Carpenter seemed to have a general understanding that nothing was scarier then the fear of the unknown.  In the original 'Halloween' Myers was an unseen terror lurking in the shadows, stalking his victims and biding his time until he decided to strike.  He didn't show even a HINT of emotion or humanity.  Until the audience caught a glimpse of him with his mask off, most people probably weren't even sure he was human.  We didn't know WHAT the motivation was for his rampage.  It was as if ""death itself descended on Haddonfield.""

By explaining too much, in my opinion, Zombie ultimately betrays that concept and demystified what made Michael Myers so cool in the first place.  If you'd made the first half about ANYONE other then the Michael Myers character, it would have worked and been a hundred times better.

I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.

If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.

3179039,1,B000VKL6Z2,"The Halloween series adds one more piece of trash to the tired franchise. Sadly, it made lots of money and will return again soon. What the producers are doing with this movie series is like a pimp that continues to drag his tired old prostitute to the curb and demand she make a dime. And like in real life only shallow, low-brow, easily amused individuals step up and pay their hard earned money and then ask for more. What keeps them coming back is knowing that at one time this tired old hooker actually looked good and delivered a quality service. I believe the original Halloween is one of the best movies ever made and I didn't think for a moment that this one would come close to being that good. However, I expected more than this scare-free, vulgar talking at every turn (seriously - who talks like that 24/7?), nude obsessed junk. When will we get back to suspense? What's scary about seeing a guy slowly creeping towards his victims from two miles away. What happened to the stalker jumping out - unexpectedly.

3179040,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I finally watched Rob Zombie's ""remake"" of Halloween.  It wasn't completely horrible and I didn't feel like I wasted 2 hours, however, I have no desire for any repeat viewings.  For me, this just didn't feel like ""Halloween"" at all.  It completely lacked the two major factors (at least for me) that made the original ""Halloween"" work...and even the second one to some degree.  The two factors are suspense and atmosphere.  Zombie's version could really have been about any generic psycho at really any time of the year.

Main problems:
1. No real scares or sense of real menace.
2. I more or less disliked the Haddonfield actors (Strode & her friends).
3. Myers has too much screen time overall.
4. Too many Myers-in-the-daylight scenes.
5. Too much of a ""white trash"" background to Myers.

I understand what Zombie was trying to do, but for me it didn't work very well at all.  He should stick to developing his own original ideas into film.  I'm glad I Netflixed this instead of buying it outright.",1198713600,,1001,4.706896551724138

3179042,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I'll start off by saying that I got this on Christmas. I was glad that I got it but when I seen other peoples reviews and said there was a nice escape scene in the other version, I wished my dad got me the other one. Well this movie was very interesting. I liked how Zombie reflected about half of the movie on Myers childhood. I don't know if his family was really like that because it felt like he added his own sickest style to it. In the original the Myers family looked like middle or upper class people with a very nice house. When you look at this you see that the mom is a stripper and his step dad looks like a drunk with a very poor house. There was a lot of nudity in this movie to. There was some unnecessary scenes and that including one thing that made this movie go towards a sick and nasty Rob Zombie movie. There was a rape scene in this movie that felt really dumb and corny and I wished they would have just kept the escape scene. I haven't seen the escape scene but I can tell it was good by the reviews. I new the cast looked very familiar because they have been in every one of Robs movies. I thought the mask was very stylish and I think John should of done that. I wished it could have been a lot more violent because of the unrated version. It just looked like they wanted to focus on nudity and sex. Plus the ending felt very stale and I felt like I got dupped. The extras on the second disk was okay. The bloopers were very funny and it felt like they didn't take it very serious and it also felt you didn't watch a horror movie.

OveraLL this was okay but Im going to see if I can find the escape scene online so I can feel better about this ""horror"" movie.",1198713600,2,1685,4.0148809523809526
3179043,1,B000VKL6Z2,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I am such a big fan of the original version, but this one made me want to cry.

When I think of Halloween, there are many things that should have been incorporated into the movie. First, the scene where Micheal wears a sheet and glasses (which he does in this movie). Everything else was missing. There sould have been a scene where Laurie was in the closet and Micheal tried to get her. One other important thing is only being able to see his mask, as if it were floating in mid air. No scenes like this. Instead, they make him to be more like Jason from Friday the 13th. I love the Friday the 13th franchise, but his is Halloween. Micheal lurks in the shadows and surprises his victims, he does not use brute strength to tear through everything to get to the victim. I enjoyed the backstory idea, but I didn't like how they made his family trailer trash.

I really liked the young girl who played Laurie Strode. I am really happy that Rob Zombie did not make her like she was in the original version. In all honesty, there is no 17 year old girls like that in 2007. I am glad he made her spunky instead of Amish.
I also really liked how the mask was all aged and dilapidated. These were the only two good parts of the movie.

One things that really bothers me is that I felt like I was back in freaking 1972 throughout the entire movie. Every single male character had long hair. I thought they were all in a bad 1970 rock band. I understand that the movie probably starts out in the 80's, so the long hair would be expected. But when it is in present day, come on. Every single movie that Zombie makes is like a freaking music video because all the guys are like rock stars with long hair. THIS IS 2007.

Another things that bugs me is, yet again, this movie has the same cast from House 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. I honestly have not seen another movie with these actors in it, and there is probably a good reason for that: THEY CAN'T ACT. The exception is Sherri-Moon Zombie. I actually really liked her in this movie. But the rest, come on. They are freaking Z-List celebrities.

And lastly, I do not consider this a horror movie. I consider this a porn movie with Micheal Myers as a side character. Every five minutes there is a sex scene with naked women running around. It was so gross. Even the scene when Micheal escapes the sanitarium is because of a gross sex scene. (which I don't understand why the two men wish to do what they did to the poor woman in Micheal's room. This was a very weak scene.) Almost all of the main characters that die in this movie die right after or during having sex. The sex scenes overshadow the gore scenes. I mean, Micheal will be in the middle of killing someone, and suddenly it skips to a sex scene. When we come back, there is blood EVERYWHERE, and we don't get to see how this happened. I would much rather see the blood shed, and less porn. I mean, if I wanted to see a porn movie, I would rent one.

This movie was complete and utter trash. I really want everyone to watch the original Halloween instead of this stupid movie. Although, if you are in for a good porn flick, then I'd rent this one.

Its inclusion makes for a very different film on the unrated DVD.  I saw this movie with my dad when it came to the cinema, and I was a little uncomfortable then, being that we are  huge fans of the original.  But had we seen this version together, I probably would have been cowering under my seat with embarrassment  This has Zombie's stamp all over it.  And his style has won him devotees.  I am fairly indifferent to his previous films.  But,  there are some redeeming qualities to this movie--his efforts are admirable.  In the end, I think it falls short of what the collective Halloween fan-base desired.  Some director's cuts don't vary much from the original release.

I think the rape scene didn't help film but made me wish I got the Theatrical Version. In August when I first saw Halloween, the escape scene was one of my favorite scenes. The whole two guards raping a girl in Michael's room just seemed stupid, and it made me feel like I was watching Devil's Rejects, insteed of Halloween.

Also, Zombie has some creepy
scenes with respect to the budding superhuman psychopath who goes by the name of Michael Myers: Loomis' black and white tapes (Malcolm McDowell is completely wasted in this role) where a young Myers wears demented masks, descending further and further into psychosis and rage.  That's about the only chill you're gonna find in this movie.

The rest is just typical Rob Zombie fare.  Young women bruised and bloody, screaming in pain, sociopathic trailer trash descending further and further into hopelessness, and scene after scene of depraved brutality for brutality's sake.

You almost get the feeling that Zombie is parodying the original: Malcolm McDowell actually hosts a college lecture on guess what, folks? ""The Devil's Eyes""!  Would that have anything to do with the lines Donald Pleasance rasped (effectively) about Myers' in the first film?  And hey, Brad Dourif is the sherrif!  Otis is the graveyard keeper for Haddonfield!
Udo Keir is in the movie for about five seconds!  Wow!

Oh, and we get treated to about fifteen minutes of a young Michael killing some mice.  Thanks, Rob.

That disturbing, unnameable, mysterious atmosphere in the original is replaced by mere slasher fare.  I have to admit that I really don't get what people are out to get with respect to Zombie as a filmmaker.  All he does is imitate classic grindhouse flicks of the 70's to very little effect.  The only redeeming quality I can find in any of his work is perhaps the increase in hygiene around the country: I've felt compelled to take a shower after watching a couple of his movies.

Veteran actor Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) is somewhat a disappointment as Dr. Loomis, formally played by now deceased actor Donald Pleasence. Relatively newcomer Daeg Faerch makes an interesting young psycho crazed Michael Myers with the exception he is far too old for the role that was originally cast for a much younger actor. The greatest liberty in Zombie's film is that of Michael Myers lost but not forgotten sister, Laurie Strode. Zombie's  sequel paints Strode as a sexual, free thinking, rather loose, filthy mouth character, where John Carpenter saw Laurie Strode as a nave innocent good little girl, in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Zombie's Laurie Strode played by Scout Taylor Compton is completely ineffective in comparison to the 1978 version played by now veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis. Zombie adds an occasional line or two from the original movie and keeps the bone chilling musical score written by John Carpenter, even though Zombie's film completely lacks the classical ""element of surprise"" which made October 1978 movie goers scream and jump 5 feet out of the seats. Zombie is dead to the fact Halloween is a cult classic that has endured. You just can't resurrect and completely alter beyond all recognition, a film loved by a cult following for 30 years. 90% of Hollywood remakes fail as dose Halloween 2007. Zombie would have done far better filling in missing gaps from the original and in hiring actors that were far most suited for their roles. I hope and pray Dimension Films will measure their lack of success of the Halloween sequels, miraculously overcome their dementia and put Michael Myers to bed once and for all. Maybe Dimension Films can allow Michael Myers to sleep for 100 years and wake him up to star in a remake of Rip Van Winkle. This would be perfect for me as in 100 years I won't be here to watch that film, thank God!  Most of all I hope Michael Myers is never transformed into a Zombie film again. Don't get me wrong, I like Zombie films for the gore blood and guts  B movies they are, but enough already. I thing Zombie should expand beyond his horizons as I do think him capable of a mainstream film. If I am wrong about Zombie's talents, I would recommend he spend the rest of his life getting a body piercing or more tattoos.

Halloween is one of those films that is sacred. Touching it is like touching the Rosetta Stone. If you are going to attempt to remake it you had better have something significant to add. Rob Zombie has added something significant. While keeping the original story basically intact he has added a back story and updated what needs to be updated so that the film feels contemporary.

This film was well made, well thought out, and obviously crafted by Zombie with care and reverence of the original. I was expecting it to be lame like a host of other films but it turned out to be great.

I wish all remakes were done with such care and added as much to classic films as this did. It expanded the myth in a good way.

3179051,2,B000VKL6Z2,"This Hollywood ""carnival"" of remakes is getting uglier with no end in sight. Almost none of them work and bring very little money--movie producers should have figured this out by now. But this nonsense did not stop rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie from creating a Heavy Metal version of the 1978 classic horror film Halloween. Zombie brings an upgrade by adding new materials of his own--he is also the producer and wrote the screenplay--but most of his new content does more bad than good. The film is a long, predictable, gory, unoriginal, loud and unnecessary remake. Yes, another distorted and destructive version of a classic. Like a said earlier, Hollywood is no stranger to these so-called remakes and I hope they stop.

Brief Intro Story (some small spoilers):
Introvert teenager Michael Myers lives with his dysfunctional family. He likes to wear his clown mask and loves torturing animals in his room while his stripper mother fights all the time with her alcoholic husband--Myer's older sister is not that nice either. After an incident with some bullies at school, Michael takes it to the next step. He becomes a ruthless serial killer and the bully is his first victim (this is where Zombie starts playing the classic main theme.)

It's Halloween night and while his mother is ""working"" Michael decides to kill again and starts from home--using a big kitchen knife and a baseball bat. Everybody in the house gets it except his baby sister. His mother comes home and sees little Myers holding his baby sister and realizes what happened. After this horrific incident, he is taken into custody. While in prison, after talking to Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and his mom, little Michael kills again (this time a nurse is the victim) and that pretty much seals his fate--at least for now. Years pass by and Michael is now a super ""wrestler-like"" giant who still wear his masks, but he still lives in prison. Fortunately for him, that's about to change.

Review:
Director Rob Zombie takes the freedom to explore with more detail Myers' beginning--by using his Metal artistic style. In other words, we get to see the birth of the character and probably the reasons why he becomes the T-Rex of the serial killers--a broken home and an abusive father figure are the ingredients to his behavior. But Zombie makes a fatal mistake by degrading Myers to a new regular ""sick puppy"" status. In the original film, there was a mystery surrounding Myers because we didn't know for sure, if he was even human at all. But Zombie cannot help himself and gives too much unnecessary background detail to the slasher plus superhuman physical strength. Not only he looks like a WWE wrestler, he also can take many shots to the chest and a stab to the shoulder on top of that. Wait a minute, isn't he just a ""human"" serial killer in this remake? Zombie, you're taking away the mysticism of our bogeyman.

Myers aside, the worst attributes of this Halloween are their goofy characters and their dialogue. It's all gibberish. There is no real focal point in any of them--sexual situations and dirty talk are abundant here. Not only nudity is overdone as well as the amount of blood on screen. In the original film, the killings were mostly subjective, but again Zombie follows the steps of the new ""mainstream"" of horror movies like Saw and brings an unnecessary bloodbath to the film--which by the way, the amount of blood that the victims bleed is very unrealistic.

Perhaps I'm being too harsh on Rob Zombie's effort. Despite the negativity, there are some moments of suspense that actually work. For example; young Myers killing the bully is probably the best horror scene. Also the moment when young Myers wears his white mask for the first time creating the Halloween legend, which is pretty intense to watch--the mask gets an upgrade and looks rough and scary.

The Verdict:
Moviegoers know that we have to take these remakes with a grain of salt and you don't have to be a film critic to figure that out. We've been letdown before. Rob Zombie's remake doesn't even come close to the horror and mystery of the 1978 cult classic. Adding more gore, nudity and taking away good build-up, character development and coherent dialogue are not the way to please the old school fans. Yes, there are very few moments of horror, but not enough to pay for the general admission.",1198454400,,4368,4.8328877005347595
3179052,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is an amazing remake.  When it comes to the myriad of remakes that have flooded theaters for the past decade, there have been some real clunkers.  The Omen is a prime example.  It followed every scene from the original, deviating only to splash in a little extra gore and throwing in a montage insinuating that mankind's sins (9-11 and the like) and natural disasters are signs that clearly show that the apocalypse is at hand.

Zombie's version of Halloween did not go that route.  It created something fresh.  A lot of the people that hate this movie have opinions that are biased to the point of not even being worth listening to.  I despised House of 1000 Corpses as well as Devil's Rejects.  However, I didn't let that deter me from going to see my favorite slasher being re-imagined with an open mind.  A lot of people went into this film with a set mind frame:  Halloween should have been left alone and Rob Zombie should have been kept from the material with a restraining order.  How could someone walking into a theater with that point of view possibly give it a fair review?

The content itself is fantastic.  For the first time in the history of the franchise, we get to see Michael's past.  We get to see his experiences in the mental asylum.  The role that Dr. Sam Loomis played in his early years is unveiled by a striking performance by Malcolm McDowell.  The violence is brutal and visceral.  It is as unrelenting as the audience should expect from a force of nature like Michael.  Also, while the film does reveal pieces of Michael's motivation, it never really explains why he is the way he is.  That was what John Carpenter initially intended.  He wanted his villain to be an unstoppable force of pure evil.

Zombie was sensible enough to leave many key elements largely in tact.  Michael still dons a ghost outfit.  His mask is the same.  The basic theme music stays the essentially the same.  Also, Rob Zombie avoided one of the most irksome trends in modern horror: weighing it down with a heavy metal soundtrack, and that says a lot considering that he became famous for singing heavy music.

The previous version of the franchise drug on and on and on.  It spawned pointless sequel after pointless sequel, each one filled with an increasing number of plotholes.  Case in point, at the end of part II, Loomis shoots out both of Michael's eyes.  Michael is blinded, forcing him to cover his face and swing randomly throughout the room.  When he reappears in part IV he is miraculously able to see again.  This went on until he was getting his knuckle game on with Busta Rhymes.  Would the loyal Halloween purists ask that this tradition go on until they are old and decrepid?  Rob Zombie goes back to the material that inspired the cult following and puts a new spin on it.  He also ended it in such a way that gurantees viewers will not be drug through the mud of ridiculous sequels.  But...who knows...remember what happened with H20?  Jamie Lee wasn't cutting off Michael's head, it was the paramedic!

I am disappointed that the theatrical version isn't being offered in widescreen.  However, that I can live with.  What annoys me is the incessant fodder being directed at a perfectly good remake.",1198368000,,3247,4.639718804920914
3179053,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Is it wise to try and remake the greatest horror movie of all time? No, its not. Can it be done successfully? Perhaps, with the right writer/director. And whom might be the man for the job? That would be Rob Zombie. Zombie's Halloween is gritty, realistic and character driven.

Zombie did a number of things right besides leaving the music, characters and setting in place. He made his movie a back story/prequel leading into a quasi remake. He penetrated the mythos of Michael Meyers with realistic applications of psychopathology leading into the orgins of a budding serial killer. Zombie is obviously well versed in psychology and the buisness of serial killing. Michael Meyers becomes more human and real in Zombie's version but only to a point. Meyers still retains an ominous, etheral quality and Zombie leaves the audience wanting to know even more about him and his motives. Does that suggest a sequel? No, it suggests a powerful movie experience and a worthy finale to the Halloween franchise.

As a side note:
This theatrical version is better than the unrated version because the escape sequence is more realistic and the edits make the movie less sympathetic to Michael which makes for a more streamlined and scary experience.",1198368000,2,1239,4.980676328502415
3179054,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This film, directed by Rob Zombie (The Devil's Rejects, House of 1,000 Corpses) treads on familiar territory for those familiar with Michael Myers, the slasher killer in the William Shatner mask, but takes it much further and gives much more insight into the origins of this enigmatic character. The backstory begins in 1978 in Haddonfield, Illinois, when Michael is 10 years old, portrayed by Daeg Faerch, who adores his mother Deborah (portrayed by Sheri Moon Zombie) but hates her boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe). His older sister Judith (Hanna Hall) is promiscuous and this bothers Michael. The other member of his family he adores is his younger sister Laurie, whom he affectionately calls ""Boo."" Michael's path of destruction begins with killing animals and then graduates to full-fledged murder, of his older sister, his mother's boyfriend, his sister's boyfriend and a schoolyard bully. He is then sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he is evaluated by Psychiatrist Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) who treats him for 15 years until Michael begins not speaking and shuts himself down emotionally. Michael begins an affinity for masks while locked in the Sanitarium, an obsession really, and is seen more often than not wearing homemade masks. After Loomis stops treatment and becomes a best-selling author, profiting from the deaths his patient caused, Michael, now an adult (Tyler Mane (X-Men)) escapes, killing several along the way. He then makes his way to Haddonfield, where he stalks his now-teenage sister (portrayed by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie's parents are portrayed by Dee Wallace Stone (Abominable, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Cujo, The Howling) and Pat Skipper, and her two friends, Lynda and Annie Brackett, are portrayed by Kristina Klebe and Danielle Harris (Halloween 4, Halloween 5). The rest of the film should be familiar to fans of the original, with a few surprises along the way. I should warn you-with this unrated edition, there is plenty of sex, there is plenty of swearing, there is plenty of nudity, and yes, there is plenty of violence. But these elements help to propel the story along and really make for a film experience unlike any seen in 2007. This film is not an exact carbon-copy of the original, it is not a sequel, and is not exactly a straight remake; it is a film which stands on its own as a true masterpiece of modern horror and terror. I give this one 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1198368000,,2443,5.0495049504950495
3179055,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding.  Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!

Unfortunately, the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD is not the same film that was offered to horror fans in theaters. More than just added footage that had to be cut in order to receive an ""R"" rating by the MPAA, this Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on this DVD a much weaker flick. Alas, the original scene is not even included as an extra on the disk and is missing altogether, and a few fans that missed the film in the theater run don't realize they are watching a different film.

Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but sadly the film for which he earned those kudos is not the one on the Unrated Director's Cut DVD.  Zombie should be chastised NOT delivering that great remake to his fans for home viewing.

The four-star rating is for this DVD, not the real film fans saw in theaters last fall.  Alas, Zombie's true work of art is currently only offered in the vsiually butchered 1.33:1 Wal-Mart Trailer-trash version, but fans won't find it on the Unrated Director's Cut.  Fans who want to revisit the great vision they saw in theaters can only hope that it will someday be released on DVD in widescreen...perhaps as a part of some ultimate edition package.",1198368000,14,1924,4.847560975609756
3179056,4,B000VKL6Z2,"The unrated director's cut of Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" coming out in time for Christmas?  Well, the movie only came out on August 31st of this year, which I thought was two months early for this particular film, but apparently that was so they could still get the DVD out in time for it to be an ironic if not perverse stocking stuffer (the movie was still in theaters at the start of December).  Marketing strategy aside, it should be made clear that this film is actually more than a remake of John Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B00104AL5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>.  The story of how young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) became a killer as a little kid is now the entire first act of the film and not simply the prologue, and in Zombie's revisions it is made clear why Michael picked up that big knife and started slicing and dicing.  Bullied at school, abused at home by his wicked stepfather (William Forsythe), and saddled with a stripper for a mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), Michael has more than his fair share of issues.

We also get to see some of Michael's sessions with Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and what happened to make Michael's baby sister an orphan.  This reflects the other significant difference between this and the original, which is that this time around we know that Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is Michael's sister.  Actually, in the final analysis this movie covers what happens in the original and what happens in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequel/dp/B00005LC4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequel</a>&nbsp;(and if you want to stretch things Michael's fascinating with masks could be a wink and a nod to the atrocious ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-III-Season-Of-The-Witch/dp/B0000AOX09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween III - Season Of The Witch</a>"").  Not that Laurie ever makes it to the hospital, but in the end it come to the siblings.  That sounds like a lot, to condense two movies and add a whole new first act, but once Zombie gets to Halloween present he concentrates on hitting the highlights from the original and throwing in plenty of echoes from the originals: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-from-Another-World/dp/B00009NHC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing from Another World</a>"" is still playing on the television and ""Mr. Sandman"" is still being sung.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Zombie's strategy in making this film.  On the one hand he sticks to the unforgettable music of Carpenter's original score, but on the other he avoids going head to head with that movie's iconic scene when Laurie finds the tableau display of Annie's corpse.  I also have to say there was a lot less blood and gore than I would have suspected given Zombie's previous cinematic efforts (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Rejects/dp/B000AXWHSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Rejects</a>""), but there is a concerted effort here to be more in the style of the original and it is nice to be reminded that a good door slam can be more terrorizing that a geyser of blood.  It is for that slight change in sensibilities, plus all the nifty DVD extras, that lead me to round up on this one.  It goes without saying that the remake does not surpass the original--which stands out in our memories because for most of us it was the first time we saw the killer keep getting up again and again--but no one ever thinks that is going to be the case, so when that turns out to be the case it is not a surprise.  Just do not be surprised when you finish watch this remake that you do not feel the urge to go back and enjoy the original yet again.",1198368000,2,3888,5.543918918918919
3179057,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Michael Myers is finally getting the makeover he has need for quite some time. Just like Mr. Voorhees, Michael has become more of a joke as studios continue to crank out their umpteenth installment of another slasher film to make minimal profits. Rob Zombie introduces us to a young Michael Myers growing up in a dysfunctional family and it is very entertaining stuff.

The return of the classical characters like Dr. Loomis was fine, because he was critical to the overall history. I felt the movie would have been better if Rob had just created all new characters beyond that, while keeping the historical facts concerning Michael intact. We see when Rob used his creative license to fill in gaps for young Michael growing up or his time in the mental institute, the movie is a lot fresher and fun to watch. The last hour basically picks up where we get a lot of redone scenes from the original. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was all well done...but scenes like the ""ghost sheet"" scene and others being included make me wonder what Rob might have come up with on his own. If there is a sequel, we might find out!

As far as director commentary, Rob delivers again with some pretty cool insights on the movie and the extras are a lot of fun. I'm not sure if Rob would do another remake, but Friday the 13th could use it. Once the franchise veered off to Manhatten, then Hell, and even into the future in Outer Space, it was time for someone to wake up.",1198281600,,1456,4.449438202247191

But,even with the deleted scenes...There were still scenes not on the DVD.....Like the scene with Bill Moseley & Leslie Easterbrook. SO.....I purchased the Theatrical Cut as well. The Special Features are the same as the Unrated DVD.",1198281600,2,408,5.390625
3179059,4,B000VKL6Z2,"First off, I grew up watching alot of slasher genre films and the original two Halloween films scared the crap out of me as a kid, plus I've been a big fan of Rob Zombie's twisted creativity for many years so I was really excited about his updated take on what has become known as one of the greatest slasher film franchises ever.
  Having seen it in the theater and loving it, I looked forward to the inevitable ""Director's"" or ""Unrated"" cut of the film on DVD. I can't say I was disappointed but this version of the film feels more sympathetic to the monstrous Michael Myers, whereas the original cut left it more for the audience to decide for themselves if Michael deserves any sympathy. I was left with a strong satisfaction for Michael's fate and Laurie's reclamation of her homicidal birthright, the ""Unrated Cut"" stole a bit of that away from me. I was left with more compassion for Michael, and an overwhelming sense of pity for Laurie's destroyed innocence. This version of the film, through the deletion of the theatrical version's bloody massacre of the asylum guards and the insertion of Michael's violent revenge against two repugnant orderlies, fine-tuned a possible message of Michael's gory mission to find his beloved Laurie-- perhaps even to restore some warped semblance of his previous life.
  Rob has injected a more obvious tragedy to the story of Michael Myers and his search for Laurie. I feel almost a mythic connotation to it all, urban mythic-- the boogeyman with the heart of gold, or at least, gold-plated.
  At times, many people-- and critics-- have allowed nostalgia for John Carpenter's original film to obscure their objectivity in reviewing Rob's version. I won't go into my opinions of the original, but I did thoroughly enjoy this updated version. It has even made me lust after a Rob Zombie retelling of Jason Voorhees' and Freddy Krueger's stories-- imagine ho farked-up those would be.
  Anyway, BUY THIS but BEWARE, this version of the film is radically different with just a few subtle-- and one not-so-subtle-- changes! You'll feel the difference, and that isn't always for the best.",1198281600,3,2127,4.872576177285318
3179060,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Unlike Gus Van Sant's 1998 ""Psycho"" remake, in which he decided to match Hitchcock's original film shot-for-shot, Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" adds his own vision to the Carpenter original. The result? It's a more brutal film, especially when no blood is being shed. Example: A thoroughly bummed-out and disillusioned young Michael Myers sits on a curb on Halloween night, in costume, as the other kids go frolicking by. Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"" plays in the background while Zombie ping-pongs between shots of Michael and his stripper mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) working the pole at the local dive bar. It's a master stroke, the kind of thing Rob seems to do so well and so effortlessly...how DO you show sympathy toward a character that's largely unsympathetic?

Another smart decision was to have Malcom McDowell in the role of Dr. Loomis. If you're familiar with the backstory of the original Halloween films, you know that the late Donald Pleasance has been credited as the ""mojo"" behind those films, an established actor who graciously became involved at a lower pay rate than he was accustomed to because he believed in Carpenter and his story. McDowell does his own thing here. He does not ""reinvent"" the role as much as he expands on it, just like the movie expands on John Carpenter's foundation.

The ""Zombie Regulars"" are here, and it adds to the squirm factor to see Danielle Harris from ""Halloween 4"" and Halloween 5"" in the role of Myers victim Annie Brackett. Scout Taylor-Compton plays the role of Laurie Strode more like a teenager and less like an adult...she's definitely not channelling Jamie Lee Curtis on any level, and that's a good thing. It was a brilliant move to have Sid Haig and Bill Moseley in relatively minor, supporting roles...it thoroughly obliterates any temptation to compare the film to ""The Devil's Rejects"" (there IS no comparison...they are two completely different movies).

Some people will feel that the movie never should have been made, others (like myself) had no choice but to watch it based on the strength of Mr. Zombie's two previous directorial efforts. I feel that is significantly better than ANY ""official"" Halloween film that followed ""Halloween 5.""",1198281600,3,2207,5.024590163934426

Rob seemed to get bored at this point and just threw the rest all together.  To say the least when this movie ended I stood up and uttered these words out loud...""THIS MOVIE SUC!ED BA!!$ !!!"" no joke...
  Fast forward to the DVD.  Now I decided to watch again to make sure I wasn't just fooling myself.  So after watching it with the extras I learned that Rob Zombie lived in a 20 person town full of nimrods.  Hmmm let me put in extras of Myers walking 20 feet behind people in Daylight!  YES DAYLIGHT!  I don't know about you but if I see a 7 foot 320 pound monster wearing a freekin mask walking down the street it might be cause for alarm!!!  HUH?  WHAT??  YEA! And holy crud!  He casts the same people that were in his last 2 movies!  They must owe him some favors or something. The rest of it just drives me crazy.  I don't understand the directors today that have to shake the camera on the ""stressful"" moments in the movie.  It takes away from the action and is just plain dumb.
  The Extras were a bore.  Zombie looks like he just wished he didn't make the movie during the interview.  Nothing but sigh talk sigh talk..
  So this movie is a rental at most just so you can say you watched another crappy remake that didn't live up to the billing.

3179067,3,B000VKL6Z2,"The Halloween series has always been one of my favorite horror film series, and in fact, its probably the most well-rounded and credible horror series when to compared to Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and so on. After all, there are no really bad sequels in this series (with the exception of Halloween III which isn't a real horrible movie itself, but has nothing to to with the Michael Myers story and therefore really has no relevance). There has been no ""Michael in Space"" or ""Zombie Michael Myers that gets buried and resurrected"" plots in this series, and for that, I have to commend them for that. However, when I first heard about this ""remake"" of the original Halloween, I thought it was a terrible idea. Why in the world would you want to remake a classic like Halloween? Its just like all these other remakes that seem to dominate theaters these days. Can't anyone think of anything original anymore? And almost all these remakes are no not even close to being as good as the original film. There's absolutely no reason to remake a film like Halloween unless its only to cash in. And that's probably the real reason why this movie was even considered being made in the first place. These people know that its gonna bring in horror fans, both young and old, out of the woodwork. And of course, fans are gonna be critical and compare the two films relentlessly. So to all the movie producers and film makers out there..STOP REMAKING CLASSIC FILMS!! All you guys are doing is watering down and for the most part ruining the reputations of actual good movies!! Okay, now that off of my chest, let's start the review, shall we?

  First of all, to say that this is purely a remake is incorrect. Its half prequel, half remake, really. But when I found out that Rob Zombie would be writing and directing the picture, my hopes got much brighter about the film. I love House of the 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, and I really thought that he would bring something new to the series but without screwing everything up. After watching the film in theaters, and now on DVD, I can't say that he didn't bring something new to Halloween series, but for the most part, I definitely think he did more harm than good. I just have a hard time accepting this movie as being anything but mediocre, really. There's just way too many things that I didn't like about the actual plot of the story, and yes, way too many differences, and flat out contradictions of that of the original Halloween. I know, maybe its unfair to compare it the original Halloween so closely, but dammit, I can't help it. I love the original film. Its gotta be one the best horror films ever made. And just don't like the fact that someone can come in and nearly change everything about it, and yet call it, if only partially in this case, a remake.

  First off, almost all the backstory of the young Michael Myers is total contradiction to the original film. Yeah, I know there wasn't really anything shown or told about Myers' childhood or family life in any of the films, but then again, there was no hint of anything BAD happening to him either! Why did Zombie feel the need to put in every bad cliche into the home life of young Michael Myers. Living in a trashy environment, a stripper mom, an abusive, drunk father figure, a bitch of a sister, being bullied at school, being neglected, and the list goes on an on. It seems like Zombie was GIVING Michael Myers a reason to become the monster he became! That's not what the original film was about. The great thing about that film was the idea that no one knew why Michael did what he did. He had no reason. That's what's scary about it. How a normal boy could do something like that without a cause. But here, you don't have that.

  Another thing I didn't like was the acting and the portrayal of some of the characters, especially the Lorrie Strode character played by Scout Taylor-Compton. She's just so damn annoying!! Geez, Jamie Lee Curtis did such a good job of playing the ""girl next door"" role, and here you have a annoying, bubbly, whore wanna be. I know that you gotta modernize the characters a bit, but c'mon! I was wanting Michael to kill Lorrie a minute into her first scene, not to mention her friends, which were just as bad! Now it is worth mentioning, that when the chase scenes with Lorrie and Michael begin, Taylor-Compton actually does a pretty good acting good there. Also, Daeg Faerch, who played young Michael Myers, and well as Sheri Moon Zombie, who played Michael's mother, Deborah, just didn't fit the parts to me. Faerch acting wasn't all that great, and he just didn't look the part, and Sheri Moon's acting was alright, but seeing her play that kind of role just doesn't look right to me. And Malcolm McDowell didn't exactly put on a brilliant performance himself either.

  Other things I didn't like..well.. the scene where 10 year old Michael kills his sister in his trademark mask just looks, well..stupid. The mask is huge and looks dumb on a child's body, and its not scary at all. Not even a little. And speaking of body, I really thought that the Michael Myers character was too physically big. Michael Myers is supposed just some average looking guy, not a professional wrestler, so why make him so larger than life? The way Michael seems to ""grunt"" numerous times in the film, what the heck is up with that? And the way Michael seems to try ""interrogate"" Lorrie's step mom by showing her Lorrie's picture and I assume, trying to find where she was at..just way out of the Michael Myers character for me. I also thought the music was mis-used in the film. At times, it felt like Zombie was trying to use the music to build a mood, when there was really nothing there to build upon.

  Alright, enough of the bashing of this film. I actually have some good things to say about it. After all, I am giving it 3 stars! First off, I like the blood gore content. A definite step up from the original, though just to make things clear, you don't need blood and guts and gore to make a film, nor does that stuff make a film good. But I'm just saying I liked that aspect of this film. Also, the guys who did the Michael Myers mask did a great job on this one. It looks real close to the original mask. And speaking of the mask, Tyler Mane does a pretty decent job of portraying Michael Myers as well. I also felt that the last half hour of the film was real good too. I especially liked the scenes where Lorrie was hiding from Michael in-between the walls and in the loft of the house. I thought Zombie really did a good job there.

  So finally I've come to the end of this ungodly long review! Thanks to those you've actually read this whole thing. In closing, I know that I'm probably being too critical about some of the things I didn't like about this film. And if I had never seen the original, or wasn't a big fan of the original film, I probably wouldn't be so critical and be picking out every single little thing that's different from the original. I know that when a remake of a film is made, you can't simply copy everything from the original, otherwise, what's the point in remaking it? But on the other hand, how can you call something a remake, when in fact, there are so few similarities between it and the original? There's got to be some balance somewhere. Anyways,as a stand alone film, maybe its better than I'm giving it credit for. And if it hadn't been a ""Halloween"" movie, and just another horror film, I might have loved it. And again, that's why I'm giving it a benefit of a doubt and trying to ignore my biased opinion and giving this film 3 stars. However, I can't help to compare to the original classic. And this one doesn't ever really come close in capturing the mood or suspense that the original film did. And as far as comparing to the other films in the series, this is one of the worse. Is it worth watching or worth owning? I say yes to both. But its nothing really great to watch, and I wouldn't say its a ""must buy"" unless you have all the other Halloween films and need for your collection. And thats one of the very few reasons, I own this film right now.",1198108800,,8194,4.447701532311792
3179068,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Horror fans! Don't hate me, but the Rob Zombie remake of ""Halloween"" could quite possibly be better than the John Carpenter directed original. I love the first ""Halloween"" (I even caught it at a movie theatre where they played it the night before Halloween and the day of) and I love Rob Zombie's previous two movies. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" wasn't very good, but I enjoyed it...And ""The Devil's Rejects"" was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Zombie's re-imagining of ""Halloween"" sticks close enough to the original store to not upset horror buffs, but puts his own stamp on it at the same time. One thing the film does is delve a bit deeper into the childhood of Michael Myers. The movie opens on Halloween, where we meet the family. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon) is a stripper with an abusive, drunken, crippled boyfriend. He has a baby sister and an older sister and, besides wearing masks constantly appears fairly normal. Well, for two seconds...Until we watch him slaughter his pet rat. Pretty soon, Michael has killed a schoolyard bully and, while his mother is at work, he kills the boyfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend...Leaving only the baby alive. Sent to a mental asylum, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, who is nice to see in a nice-guy role) is assigned to treat Michael. Pretty soon though, Michael has killed a nurse at the asylum and has withdrawn into his mind...And not long after, his mother commits suicide. 15 years later; Michael escapes from the asylum and decides to try and find his sister. Most of the things that happen after his escape will seem quite familar to watchers of the original film. Zombie did a really great job with this movie. Learning about the Myers character was very interesting and creepy. His casting of McDowell (whom he no doubt cast over his love for ""A Clockwork Orange"") was great, as well as casting Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) as a cop. The aging of the characters is very well done. When we meet Loomis in the beginning, he looks like a fairly younger guy. 15 years later; Loomis looks like...Well, Malcolm McDowell. ""Halloween"" has it's share of originality on top of the things that were necessary for the remake (i.e., the music). But this is easily the best remake I've seen of a horror film in a good long while. Rob Zombie is a very gifted writer/director (I'm starting to like his movies better than I ever liked his music) and I hope he continues, because this movie already shows that Zombie has created a signature style (listen to the dialogue between Michael's mother and her boyfriend in the beginning of the film). Anyway, as it is a horror film...It's no masterpiece. And it has its share of nudity and violence, but overall...It's a work of art.

3179069,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I hate remakes.  The horror genre has become a breeding ground for remakes and re-hashes of classic films in the genre, as is the case with Halloween.  As flawed as House of 1000 Corpses was, musician turned director Rob Zombie more than made up for it with The Devil's Rejects, which really seemed to find him coming into his own.  That's why I was looking forward to the Halloween remake, of which I had heard both great and terrible things about.  After viewing it, well, it's not nearly as terrible as what I had heard, but at the same time, the film is a needless remake that wastes much of it's potential.  The subtlety of John Carpenter's original classic is replaced with brutal violence and buckets of blood, as we witness the beginnings of Michael Myers' (played as a child by Daeg Faerch, and later by X-Men's Tyler Mane) journey to becoming a killer from his childhood on, as Zombie makes an attempt to give the viewer a sympathetic view towards Michael.  The relationship with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is further examined as well, as is Michael's return to Haddonfield.  The abundance of backstory and sympathetic view towards Michael Myers is where Halloween fails, but where it succeeds is with Zombie's techniques for getting the most out of the shocks and scares that he pummels the viewer with.  The final act, in which Michael faces off with Laurie Strode (the super cute Scout Taylor-Compton), is a visceral blast, as is what leads up to it.  As he has done before, Zombie has peppered genre stalwarts throughout the film, including his wife Sheri Moon, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree, Sid Haig, and an all grown up Danielle Harris, whose role here is a far cry from the petrified child of Halloween 4 and 5.  The two-disc Unrated edition features an insightful commentary from Zombie, plenty of deleted scenes (including Adrienne Barbeau's deleted role), a more downbeat alternate ending, and a pretty funny blooper reel.  Not for the faint of heart to be sure, Rob Zombie's Halloween remake isn't anything spectacular, but it's nothing terrible in the least either, and more than worth checking out for horror/slasher fans young and old alike.",1198108800,5,2263,4.851948051948052
3179070,2,B000VKL6Z2,"What can I say, this update disapointed me. While the introduction and history of the pre-teen Michael Myers was nice as a prequel of sorts, the almost word-for-word remake of that fateful Halloween night fifteen years when ""He"" came home lacked the same spark as the first time around. Each new actor seemed to turn in a murder-by-numbers approach with the established characters, and the movie's new ending really paled in comparision to the 1978 original. While to any fan of the Halloween franchise should see this at least once, it will definitely NOT replace your yearly viewings of the original. If only Rob Zombie concentrated on making a prequel only instead of this watered down attempt to lure a new generation of audiences, this could have been a little more satifiying.

While I'm here, let me let others in on what exactly is on that Circuit City exclusive bonus third disc. First off, it's in a paper sleeve (not part of the original packaging), that has only one extra feature, a 20 minute discussion with Rob Zombie & three other cast members at Comic-Con 2007. In fact, it doesn't even have a menu, just plop in the disc and it begins. I was wondering why this wasn't just put on the 2 disc as maybe an easter egg or something, it should have fit in the space nicely. Oh, and concerning that regular's second disc....if you missed Malcolm McDowell's personality from ""A Clockwork Orange"" after he made that film, check out the 10 minutes of Bloopers with him, he's a riot, almost as if this film brought out the lost ""Alex De Large"" outta him again. It's just too bad it didn't show during the actual movie.

Overall, the extra features were more entertaining than the movie. A movie that didn't need to be remade, but worth one look as to see why not.",1198022400,,1770,4.6158730158730155
3179071,5,B000VKL6Z2,I have been a fan of Rob Zombie since he was in white zombie. He then went on to make movies like the devils rejects & house of 1000 corpses.  His remake of halloween was totaly awsome,1198022400,3,184,3.972972972972973
3179072,3,B000VKL6Z2,"It seems that Rob Zombie's efforts are usually hit or miss. Unfortunately, this one slips somewhere between the cracks of both. I'm not going to relay the story, as several people already have, but instead I'd like to lay out a few key points (positive and negative) on the film.

  The first act of the film deals with Michael Myer's childhood and the reasons behind his descent into madness. The original film provided us with no real reason for his bloodthirst and honestly...did we really need a explanation? Isn't it scarier to NOT know? Regardless, I was hoping the same as everyone else that Zombie would come up with a creative and original idea...he did not. Micheal Myers is an unstoppable serial killer because he was picked on in school, his mom was a stripper and his home life sucked. Seriously, that's it?! THAT is what we've been waiting for? I could turn on any daytime drama and find the same tired old plot. To make it even less appealing we are literally birraged with over-the-top foul language and brutal violence. Mr. Zombie seems to be in the mind set that violent images and grotesque deaths are more important than any actual scares in his ""horror"" movie.
  The second act has Micheal in Smith's Grove. Personally, I found this entire sequence to be boring. We get it...the kid is nuts. To make matters worse the ""unrated"" version contains the most un-necessary rape scene in film history. It serves no purpose other than to simply ""shock"" the audience. Just because you make something controversial Rob, doesn't mean that it's good.
  The best part of the film is the third act, where we meet Laurie Strode and her friends (the re-make kickoff). There are some decent moments in the third act and even a few unexpected scares. Rob used the audience's knowledge of the first film as a manipulation tool. I could go on and on with the issues I have but there is one that is so outstanding I can't get over it. The dialogue is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It seems like the lines were written the day of shooting. When Lori and her friends are in the library she has the following line...

""Annie wants me to pretend to babysit Lindsay-Wallace, then sneak out and dump her with me so she can go and see Paul.""

 That doesn't even make sense. At all. Who wrote this? And it's just not in this scene, but in fact the entire ""Girl talk"" dialogue that happens is so cheestastic you can't help but laugh. The best lines in the film were imports from the original film with one or two words changed to a synonym (good job, Rob).

  The bottom line is, the negatives of this film FAR outweigh the positive. Mr. Zombie needs to worry less about making stylized 70s' trash and more about making a HORROR MOVIE.

  And if you're wondering what more we're getting in the 11 minutes...well...naked girls being raped and murdered. Yay. We've seen it all before and... it was better before.",1197936000,2,2892,4.608187134502924
3179073,2,B000VKL6Z2,"There's a scene in the original Halloween where through the camera's POV complete with holes functioning as our eyes, we follow a figure walk through a house, grab a knife and proceed upstairs to viciously attack a young girl only for it at the end to be a young boy in a clown mask. Later he grows into an unstoppable killing machine that stalks and terrorizes comes after you and no bullet or knife can stop him. It was that feeling of an evil that would continously coming after you that made ""the Shape"" such a memorable horror icon. Apparently that notion was lost on Rob Zombie who thought that clearly we need an explanation as to why he'd be such a monster (beware of hick families is the message here) and not only from a story standpoint but from a filmmaking one as well, the new Halloween just hits all the wrong notes - no pun intended, Mr. Zombie - the whole time.

Michael Myers is a seriously disturbed young boy growing up with a promiscuous sister, a controlling father figure and a stripper mother who at least tries to help. But after viciously killing his family, save his mother, Michael is institutionalized under care of Dr. Samuel Loomis. But 15 years pass and Michael escapes and makes his way back to his home of Haddonfield where he tries to track down his baby sister, Laurie.

Whereas ""the Shape"" of 1978 liked to appear in the shadows, ominously watching teenagers unaware to his presence, this new guy likes to just mindlessly bash stuff in and be as loud as possible (he's like one of those hulking brutes with the deep voice and lack of intelligence that school bullies have for protection) and this practically sucks the suspense right from the film. Remember that scene where Michael sits right up behind Laurie who doesn't see him? Nothing like that here. Not to mention the gaps in the story like the lack of trick-or-treaters, Michael's seemingly psychic knowledge of Laurie's school schedule, her present appearance, much less her name. Then of course there's things in the filmmaking spectrum like out-of-focus shots, out-of-character decisions and dialogue, continuity errors like crazy and just strange cuts (in one scene, Laurie is behind hauled away by Michael kicking and screaming and in the next shot, she's passed out being carried off by Michael. Uh, did he punch her out?) With the Zombie trademark of characters swearing with reckless abandon, and I might add, zero creativity, this Halloween version is just unfortunate.

As far as casting is concerned, the Samuel Loomis of this one, played by Malcolm Macdowell is a good one and the young boy playing Michael is good as well while the rest either overact, don't act enough or just not simply given nothing to do. The new Laurie, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, is easy on the eyes but she almost seems to be given one direction: be cute and scream your face off when the terror starts. The casting is just one of many a problem that the film faces and quite simply, there's just not enough to recommend.

In all good seriousness, I just can't recommend this. Sure it does stand out from Carpenter's original and not just a clone and the idea of exploring the evil sounds like a good idea but this is just one unfortunate business of a film.",1197936000,,3245,4.687719298245614
3179074,5,B000VKL6Z2,"this is a darker, grittier retelling of John Carpenter's classic horror flick that began the slasher genre.

3179075,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I've read quite a few different reviews,that stated Rob Zombie's new remake DIDN'T work,because it was almost a scene for scene remake that simply had nothing new to offer,that would allow it to stand up against the original (In fact,that is what kept me from seeing it in the theatre).Now that it's been released on dvd,I simply couldn't resist the temptation of purchasing it,and judging for myself (being a big fan of the original).Well,I'm glad I did...I found myself totaly immersed throughout the entire film. Yes,alot of it is scene for scene the same as the original,but how else could it be the ""same"" movie?? Enough of it is done different,to make it more than just ok (compared to the original or just horror film standards in general).I'm not going to give the ""different"" parts away here,but I found the whole thing very well done. Unlike many of the previous reviewers,I found the young Michael Myers childhood storyline,worked very well within the story as a whole. Rob Zombie has once again brought his own love of the horror classics into his work as a film director (he makes the types of films that he himself would have wanted to see,and it shows).Once again,a great soundtrack (Kiss,Blue Oyster Cult and Rush)and some great cameo guests (Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees)add to the fun. One thing that DID surprise me though,given Rob's attention to detail,is the ""non-vintage"" Kiss Destroyer shirt,that young Michael wore in the beginning of the film (shirt is 1996 era).With plenty of great extras and bonus material,this new 2 disc package is sure to provide plenty of BIG fun for any and all fans of great/classic horror films,both old and new.",1197936000,3,1665,4.907801418439717
3179076,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I was really looking forward to this remake ever since I heard about it. Zombie directing a Halloween remake/prequel? Heck yeah! What did I get? A stereotypical ""tormented kid"" who likes to kill animals. On the day it is discovered that he kills animals (the day being Halloween doesn't seem to be any catalyst) he kills a kid from school, and then goes home to be further tormented by his scummy family. Then, when he finds he can't go trick or treating, he kills his sister, her boyfriend, and his stepdad (if in fact his mother married the guy). After the cops pick him up, Mikey (who is still talking) claims he can't remember the event. Yet slowly he starts wearing masks and withdrawing, until he kills a nurse at which point he becomes ""the shape"", by which I mean he shoots up to the 7-8 foot mark, and trades in his mass of body fat for toned muscle.

It is here that we turn from the more reality based bad childhood, to the completely unrealistic Halloween portion. Honestly, what mental hospital would let a guy (especially one this physically scary) indulge in his obsession of mask-making? What guard would, after knowing what the guy did as a kid and obviously seeing the physical build, treat the guy in such a gentle manner? What about the physical build itself? Did they allow him to spend hours in a gym... with a trainer? Wouldn't they shave his hair? Completely unbelievable. The rest of the movie is just a rehash of the original, but without any tension, no compassion for the victims, and a spelling out that Laurie Strode is Mikey's sister... oh, and Dr. Loomis (who starts out as a bit of a beatnik, but then sells his story and seems to forget about Mikey until he escapes) is killed.

I know what Zombie was trying to do (at least I think I do). He was trying to bring the Myers mythology into a ""real"" world situation, giving the kid a real (or at least clinical) reason to turn psycho. The problem is that we have seen that before. We've seen the innocent kid, ruined by his environment, turned into a monster. That's why the original has so much power... because we didn't know why. It gave the story a mystical quality. Why did he kill? What did he think inside his catatonic state for 15 years? How could he drive a car? Why doesn't he die? Zombie's version answers all these questions, but the answers are cheap. Easy answers like, ""Because he was abused."" Or having him NOT be catatonic, or NOT drive a car. That's even better, cause then there is no question. ""He doesn't die because he's really big."" It cheapens the whole idea of the movie. The only question that still remains is how does he know Laurie is his sister? (why even have the whole sister thing since this is suppossed to exist outside of all the other movies. we didn't even know Laurie was his sister until the sequal) This part is left unanswered, unless you say something like, ""Because their bond was THAT strong.""

This honestly doesn't deserve the name of Halloween. This should have been called ""Mask"", advertised as yet another in the ""gritty and real"" horror movies, and then thrown in the pile with all those other nu-slashers (wolf creek, wrong turn, house of wax-the remake) and remembered only for being a mis-step in Zombie's filmography (hopefully).",1197936000,,3266,4.579487179487179

However, this is really quite the muddled mess and there's very little to like, or horrify.

The over the top characters and acting that worked so well in Devil's simply falls flat here and seems entirely out of place. Unfortunately, the movie never finds it pacing, and isn't able to generate an iota of suspense.  On the upside, fabulous to see the wonderful Dee Wallace on the screen, she's terrific.

Then he gets up after 15 seconds of them doing this bad rape scene, to crushing them to death. So if you are like me, and liked that particular part of the movie, then I would not pick this up. I am trying to find out if that scene is in the regular rated R version because I just do not understand how you take that scene out of the movie, to be replaced by this rape scene.

3179080,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Ever since the announcement that Rob Zombie would be re-imagining John Carpenterfs slasher classic Halloween, critics and horror fans alike have been picking sides, alternately at arms over what they saw as a modern travesty and supportive of Zombiefs ability to recreate and update the thrills of what many consider the original slasher flick (though Black Christmas - recently reworked for 2006fs Black Xmas - appeared in Canada over four years earlier than the original Halloween).

The film's release in late August did little to quell the controversy: critics panned it and audiences showed up in droves to push the film to a record-breaking Labor Day weekend opening. Regardless of critics words and filmgoers money, though, where does Rob Zombie's Halloween stand in the annals of horror movie history? After viewing the unrated directorfs cut of the film, along with a second disc packed full of special features, it's not a clear cut (no pun intended) victory for either side. If anything is clear, it's what Zombie attempted to do with his re-imagining: 1. Propel his film career forward by exposing himself to a wider fanbase, and 2. Attempt to psychologically deconstruct one of American horrorfs most infamous killers. Itfs obvious from the film's box office numbers that Zombie accomplished his first goal, but the second goal is a little more difficult to assess.

Opening in 1978 (a clever nod to the year the original film came out), the audience witnesses a young Michael Myers (eeriely portrayed by young Daeg Faerch) navigating his way through an abusive household, getting bullied by older kids at school, and being neglected by his stripper mother (played by Zombiefs own wife Sheri Moon Zombie). Though the opening scenes are raw and gritty - Zombies specialty - the foulness and crassness of the Myers household actually begins to take away from the assertion that Michael Myers, like Damien from The Omen, was simply born disturbed and evil. The incessant ranting by his motherfs boyfriend, and the older punks at school may serve as worthy impetuses for Michaelfs repressed violent nature and help explain his desire to hide behind a mask, but ultimately this takes away from the simple horror of a psychotic killer arising from a typical, run-of-the-mill household.

As Michael tortures and kills his pet rats, itfs clear Zombie is drawing on real serial killer history (animal torture is an early sign of sociopathy).  The reworking of the initial murder scene from the first Halloween is also strikingly impressive. In fact, for the first hour of the film, as Zombie's Myers unfolds before a bewildered audience, it starts to feel as if Zombie may have done the unthinkable and successfully created a back story that both evokes the original and adds new haunting layers to it. Malcolm McDowellfs intense Dr. Loomis provides a credible foil to Myersf silent stoicism, and playing on the mask theme works in Zombie's favor as little Michael quietly tells his mother that the mask hides [his] ugliness.

Unfortunately, once the inevitable fast-forward 15 years occurs and an older Michael Myers is accidentally let free of his sanitarium cell (in one of the most overly and unnecessarily perverse scenes in recent history) all hell breaks loose - both on and off screen. Michael sets off on his rampage of violence and Zombie's screenwriting prowess is tested beyond its breaking point. As anyone who saw The Devil's Rejects knows, Zombie is somewhat of a master at the disturbing, the subversive, and the grotesque, but when it comes to writing dialogue for suburban families and teenie bopper girlfriends, Zombie is out of his element, and his film suffers for it. Rather than continuing along the semi-realistic slant he had been following, suddenly Zombie begins to flounder. The conversations are stilted and unnatural and no character manages to evoke even a hint of redeeming qualities.

Meanwhile, Myers roams the street in broad daylight, with nary a frightened pedestrian in sight. This concept may have worked if Myers were of normal stature, but the casting of the 6' 8"" WCW star Tyler Mane as Myers makes his bemasked public appearances on quiet suburban sidewalks a little too imposing to go unnoticed. That's not to say that Mane's portrayal of the masked killer is at all faulty. His hulking physical presence and vacant stares provide more than enough chills to go around. But by the same token, those same qualities almost demand that Myers remain in the shadows as he did in the original.

Scout Taylor-Compton has little to offer as Myers' sole surviving relative Laurie Strode. A few painful scenes as a babysitter and some even more painful screaming and crying will leave audiences feeling more pain than perhaps Laurie herself feels. The fact that she can never find her way out of a mess and insists on constantly running up stairs does little to endear her to audiences. In fact, she made such a minimal impression in Zombie's original script that he changed the ending to ensure that she grew as a character. (The original ending is included in the special features).

Zombie's film does up the gore factor considerably, and the nudity factor as well. These unneeded additions could be nods to the unillustrious history of the horror/slasher film, or they could just be softballs to a built in audience Zombie is seeking to connect with; either way they're taken straight out of the Horror 101 handbook. Still, this 2007 Halloween towers over the recent glut of horror classic remakes that have hit theatres: The Omen, The Amityville Horror, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Fog, House of Wax, The Hitcher, Black Christmas, The Wicker Manc etc. Only The Hills Have Eyes and Halloween have had the audacity to do more than simply remake the originals with glossier film. Instead these films have taken the original concepts and expanded on them for a new generation of viewers.

While Rob Zombie's Halloween has done nothing to tarnish his name, it's also done nothing to improve upon his filmmaking cred. Perhaps the leap from House of 1000 Corpses to The Devil's Rejects was so vast that audiences should have expected a bit of levelling out with his newest film, but here's hoping he'll continue to push the envelope that he opened with his impressively unique and startlingly dark foray into the world of film.

The second disc of special features is exceptionally broad, and even includes a six minute blooper reel (mainly featuring Malcom McDowell's superbly un-PC riffs). A breakdown of the mask construction and a discussion with director Rob Zombie on his re-imagining offer a good deal of information for anyone interestd. The deleted scenes are here, but of course itfs clear that theyfve been deleted for a reason.  There's a brief breakdown of the entire cast, as well as clips from casting sessions. Much like the film itself, this special features disc leaves little to the viewer's imagination, but if you don't want to know, don't watch it.",1197849600,3,7006,5.010309278350515

Why would a self-professed horror film buff like Zombie even try to remake a revered classic like Halloween? Hubris? Fanboy wish fulfillment? Or, did he figure that this film was going to be made one way or another and rather than let some hack do a crappy job; he could at least bring his stylistic touches and point-of-view to the table.

Zombie's remake works because he takes the Halloween mythos and expands it in all kinds of fascinating ways. He makes some really intriguing choices like not making Michael supernaturally strong but rather a big guy who is naturally tough and strong. Zombie also opts for gritty realism like he did with The Devil's Rejects and it is a smart choice that works. Whether you love or hate his take on the material, you have to admit that it doesn't resemble Carpenter's film in any way. It is easily the best Halloween film since Part III, although that isn't really saying much when you consider the quality of the subsequent sequels.

The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Rob Zombie. He points out the various locations they shot in while also drawing our attention to where he took footage out and why. Zombie spends a lot of time talking about the challenges he faced on certain scenes. He also points out the new footage in this cut and why he put it back. The filmmaker delivers another solid commentary that is well worth a listen if you're a fan of this film.

The second disc starts of with 17 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Zombie. Unlike some auteurs, he is refreshingly ruthless with his footage and so we have a lot of scenes that were cut, including more of the strip club where Michael's mom works. There's also more of Loomis talking to a young Michael. Michael also attends a parole hearing that features a character played Tom Towles. Adrienne Barbeau even shows up briefly in a scene with Loomis. Zombie does a good job explaining why these scenes were cut.

Also included is an ""Alternate Ending"" with optional commentary by Zombie. This one is more sympathetic to Michael but wasn't satisfying enough for the director and he went with the other ending which is much more visceral.

""Bloopers"" features footage of McDowell cracking up with Sheri Moon Zombie take after take. It turns out that the veteran actor is a real goofball and looks like he's having a blast making his fellow actors laugh.

""The Many Masks of Michael Myers"" takes a look at how they constructed the iconic Michael Myers mask. They created several versions, including clean ones and then gradually grungy ones to symbolize the passage of time. We also see how the put together the various ones that Michael makes in the sanitarium.

""Re-Imagining Halloween"" is a three-part look at various aspects of the making of the film. Zombie wanted to shoot it in the style of 21 Grams and The Constant Gardener. He wanted the three acts to have their own distinctive looks: the first part was all hand-held cameras, the second was very static, and the third act used lots of steadicam work. The film's production design is examined. They take a look at the various sets and briefly talk about the specific look Zombie was after. The makeup effects are also featured. This involved a lot of work as Michael kills a lot of people. Zombie wanted them to look realistic and we see how some of the kills were done.

""Meet the Cast."" Zombie says that the casting process is the most exciting part of the filmmaking process for him because it is the first time the film feels real. He talks about why he cast the actors that he did and, in turn, they talk about their approach to the characters and a bit about working on the film.

""Casting Sessions"" is a collection of excerpts of audition footage of the cast members. It gives us a chance to see what convinced Zombie to hire them.

""Scout Taylor-Compton Screen Test"" features more footage of this young actress testing for the role of Laurie Strode. It is easy to see why she was cast as she nails the role.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1197849600,57,5535,5.656626506024097
3179082,5,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie really re-created a master piece here.
Going back to the original locations and shoot this movie for a second time was nothing but perfect.
I was really looking for this movie after I red in Newsarama that Rob Zombie was in charge. What can say? I listen to his music and now enjoy his movies.
I think that Zombie took really care in this production, kept the original soundtrack and shows us now what created such an evil mind as Myer's.
Highly recommended.",1197763200,,469,4.529411764705882
3179083,4,B000VKL6Z2,"I liked it. I really did. I enjoyed it as a film. As an individual film, seperate from the rest. Sure, it wasn't perfect. It felt a little uneven in the middle. In other words, it seemed like each half of the film were really just shortened individual films that were put together to make a whole new one. Because of that, the remake phase was a tiny bit fast-paced for me. However, overall, I enjoyed it a great deal. There is a reason why, however, that is deeper than the film itself.

What Rob presented was a great film, that had a story that wasn't perfect. Therein lies the genius of it. It felt real. It didn't feel like a movie. While many will find that to make it a cluttered mess, it didn't for me. An example would be the way he presented Michael's victims. We didn't get to know them that well before he killed them. But when some serial killer kills a group of people, and it is announced on the news, what do you think the chances are that you know those people? You don't. And yet, it is still horrifying. In other words, you don't have to know the victims to understand how terrifying the crime is.

In a movie, you follow these people around, the camera being your eye as you stalk them invisibly. You really get to know the people. Here, by not following them, it presents that realism quite well. You don't know who these people are, but whether you know them or not, Michael Myers is still presented as a terrifying being. Speaking of ol' Mikey...

I thought Tyler and Daeg's performances were amazing. I loved how even though you could sympathize with him in his early life, it didn't change how bizzare, and truly evil he was. Right in the opening scenes, we see him petting a rat, and then we see moments later cleaning a bloody scalpel or something. Then, he tells his mother that his rat died. You know what he did. It's not that hard to figure out. What's great about this is that it shows that even though he had this terrible life, he didn't just snap over night. He's been going crazy for some time. The scene with the bully in the woods was powerful, at least for me. His eventual escape was equally amazing. How he took out those guards truly showed his power, and menace. I especially liked when he killed Ismael Cruz, because that was the indicator that the young boy that went into Smiths Grove was not the monster that walked out. To quote the original Doctor Loomis, ""That part of him died years ago."" Michael Myers in this film, as a character, was just as scary as he was in the original. The best Myers since Castle IMO.

Which brings me to another point that I really liked. I think that of all the actors who could have played Loomis, Rob really picked the right one, which was surely a difficult task. Sure, many suggested Anthony Hopkins, but (and I hate to say this) having played similar characters several times, he may have had a spirited performance, but he would have taken you out of the real world, and remind you that it was only a movie. Rob could have cast an actor that wasn't that well known, but then the performance would have been lacking, and have the same effect. With someone like McDowell, he has that face that is just obscure enough that you can buy him as a real person, yet he is also a great enough actor that he can still pull an amazing performance.

The rest of the cast was great as well. I really liked Harris as Annie, and Laurie was cast pretty well in my opinion. She acted like a real teenage girl. I would know, there's one next door, and then there's my younger sister. As for greeting each other with ""Hey, Bitches"" I think that was actually rather spot on. Real girls aren't like cartoon girls, or 7th Heaven characters, who go wide-eyed the moment someone uses a curse word.

Like I said, the film isn't perfect, but it was definately better than most, if not all of the sequels. As for how it measures up against the original, well, in terms of sheer quality, no, it wasn't better. But better isn't what they set out to do in the first place. I think this is the problem with most remakes. Many people who bash them believe that the initial concept is to make a better version. What Rob set out to do was make a Halloween that was just as good as the original, to make Michael Myers scary again, and at that he passed in flying colors. Sure, the original had good things that this film didn't have, but this film had good things that the original didn't have. They're different films, so you can't really judge them together. It's not a shot-for-shot remake, and it isn't a rehash either, so there's not much room to really compare everything. The only area where you can compare them is in the level of quality, and at that, they're at about the same level for me.

Will this film have a legacy like the original? No, probably not. The original Halloween made a legacy because it was a fresh concept, and the first true slasher. Yes, it could be said that the original Black Christmas is the father of Halloween (funny, huh?), but Halloween is the father of slasher films. Without it, there would be no Friday the 13th, no Prowler, no Nightmare on Elm Street, no Cropsy (The Burning), none of these characters and franchises would have been brought to life without the original Halloween. Now that the slasher genre has grown so much, this new Halloween can't really do the same thing that the original did. However, as is evident in the upcoming Friday the 13th, it does seem as though it may inspire one new trend: remakes that actually try hard to be good movies, rather than cash-ins.",1197763200,9,5574,4.400581959262851
3179084,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I have seen alot of remakes in my life but never have I seen one as great as this.  Nothing will compare to the original film, of course, however I love how it puts a fresh take on the story and adds some more detail to Michael Myers' childhood and what drove him to become what he is.  The movie keeps enough of the original concepts and characters to seem like a true remake but adds enough new material to make it interesting.  The original film focuses alot on the three teenage girls who are the main characters other then Michael, especially on Laurie Strode.  This film does not focus on them as much, but anyone who has seen the original really doesn't need those details.  I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to the DVD release on Tuesday.",1197676800,4,757,4.378571428571429

Like everyone else, the main problem is that I must accept Michael Myers was a Kiss loving redneck with a stripper mother and a slutty sister. No one told Rob the secret of making a great movie: Less history, more mystery.. I understand what he's trying to do, but making him a moronic bloodthirsty killer is not his style, that's reserved for Jason Vorhees. This would've been a decent film if it had nothing to do with the Halloween franchise, but this one will be in the dollar bin soon enough, and we can all forget it ever happened.",1197590400,4,691,4.40625

This is now my favourite movie of all time!!! and if you don't agree well then I guess Rob Zombie did a good job scaring the hell out of you, and you must of ran outta the theatre crying for your mom, anyways way to go Rob, you've made a great remake!",1197417600,5,501,3.8737864077669903
3179087,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I am going to come right out and admit that I was extremely impressed with Rob Zombie's ""Halloween.""

His film has clearly already become the stuff of mass controversy. Most of that seemingly stems from the staunch defenders of John Carpenter's landmark original, who all curiously believe that Mr. Zombie has somehow committed a cardinal sin and defaced a highly revered genre classic. It was therefore understandable that I harbored some considerable degree of reluctance in voicing my own personal opinion. What, after all, could I possibly say in direct praise of Zombie's stellar achievement that would not automatically be meticulously scrutinized or dismissed? How many people would instantly and unfairly discredit my claim as a ""tried and true"" fan of horror simply because I dared to embrace a fresh angle on an already well established slasher?

To be quite honest, I no longer cling to such minor concerns. We, as people, can nitpick all we want. The fact is, Rob Zombie is an obvious fan of Carpenter's work and boasts a great deal of respect for the material. He has perfectly captured the brooding atmosphere and bone-chilling dread that was sorely lacking from the last several threadbare sequels. How this is such a bad thing in the eyes of certain fans, I will more than likely never fathom. This movie, in as much the same vein as Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" merely takes the premise of Carpenter's initial vision and steers it in a completely different direction. Michael Myers has finally once again become the same blood-curdling boogeyman he was nearly thirty years ago. This realization is mostly fueled by the refreshing backstory Zombie has provided us within his film's opening act. Some viewers I have noticed seem to take issue with the whole ""white trash"" approach Zombie applies to Michael's family. But, from where I stand, it works. I base that conclusion around two supporting factors, the first of which concerns Michael's subdued portrayal in Carpenter's film. While he certainly was a very formidable and sinister presence, I always still found him altogether empty and one dimensional. There was no meat on his bones, no real motive behind his heinous crimes aside from what Dr. Loomis presumed was just ""pure evil."" That was always the one key gripe I had with Carpenter's vision, and it was also something I was more than delighted to see Rob Zombie address here so many years later. My second point deals more specifically with the fleshing out of Michael's family. I found this incredibly effective and had absolutely no problem with the bold liberties Zombie took by making Ronnie White, Michael's overly abusive and potty-mouthed stepfather, so utterly and ferociously loathsome. We may not want to admit it, but people of this wretched caliber do exist within our society. Whether such horrific conduct can ultimately drive somebody to mass murder can certainly be contested. Although, for the purpose of this totally fictional horror movie, I seriously believe it was a plot device that worked sheer wonders.

As the movie segues back to Haddonfield in its second half, as most anyone already knows, Zombie shifts gears with a wonderfully nostalgic updating of ""Mr. Sandman"" and revisits more familiar territory with scenes lifted almost letter perfectly from the 1978 original. He takes us back to the same West Hollywood streets Carpenter utilized for his shoot and gives us a Haddonfield that, in many of the same ways, actually feels like an average everyday midwest american neighborhood. The set dressing and overall attention to detail is absolutely amazing!

I also rather quite liked the casting. Malcolm McDowell, the new Dr. Loomis, openly admitted that he never actually viewed any of the prior films. He was apparently discouraged from doing so by Zombie, himself, who did not wish to see a carbon copy of the Donald Pleasance portrayal. Donald's contribution to the original series, it goes without saying, will always remain legendary. But, I do have to say that I found much to enjoy with Malcolm's spin on the character, as well. The same can also easily be said for Daeg Faerch and Tyler Mane, the actors behind Michael's two respective personas. I was especially taken by the emotional range young Faerch brought to Michael's childhood. He displayed great depth in a role that, as I have already outlined, did not previously offer it. And Tyler Mane is plain and simply awe-inspiring! I won't say anything outside the simple fact that I feel he is the single greatest actor to don the Michael Myers mask since Nick Castle. He really is that good and gives Michael a raw savagery he hasn't had in years!

I have long since read up on all the many bonus features supplied within the forthcoming ""unrated"" DVD release. You can rest assured that I will most definitely be adding it to my collection.

Okay, so, having voiced all of this, I must now unfortunately and very briefly touch upon a matter that I personally would rather not. That would entail most of the highly unnecessary and heated backlash I've seen dished out in recent months against the varying slasher fans who favored this particular production. The Carpenter purists can spout all the negativity they want about Rob Zombie. I have never seen his prior films, so I have nothing further to judge him by. People mostly tend to forget that he never claimed to be ""remaking"" John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Zombie specifically stated, from day one, that he was putting his own unique stamp on this time-honored film and that is precisely what he has done. That is predominantly why this movie is called Rob Zombie's ""Halloween."" The fact that any one person enjoys this new film does not make them any less a true fan of John Carpenter's original. I find the idea that so many others vehemently disagree with that sentiment as laughable as it is pathetic. But, hey, so is the world we live in at times.

Go figure.

It's a slasher movie, not a political statement. Watch it, have fun with it, and appreciate it for what it is....a well-crafted and worthy companion piece to John Carpenter's classic.",1197331200,8,6130,4.933139534883721
3179088,5,B000VKL6Z2,"The original Halloween is a classic and will in my book always receive a five star rating. Recently there has been a great deal of remakes that were flops and catered to the teeny bopper crowd such as, The Fog, The Omen, Dark Water, etc.  However there has been only two remakes that I thought were diserving of our attenion, one being the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, and Halloween.

What I liked about the remake was it gave us something fresh to work with.  In the original Halloween we never really knew why Michael was bad, in this remake, the first thirty minutes or so expore the childhood of Michael Myers.  People say that the dialog concerning Michael's family was wrong.  Trust me, I have seen broken homes and Mr. Zombie gives us exactly what you would expect from a trashy family.

Besides satisfying my curiosity of Michael's childhood, I found this to be similar in many cases to the original, but at the same time the material was quite fresh with new chills and scares.  Zombie took a masterpiece and reminded us why it is called a masterpiece.  He accomplished a great job capturing a 70's look and theme, and did a great musical score as well.

It's got everything I and II have - storyline, atmosphere, incredible camera work, and brilliant lighting. The films that SHOULD be scorned are H20 and Resurrection.

Seeing him as a child was a treat, thus making the ending heartfelt. Im not saying you actually care for him, but you now have an understanding of him, and see it was out of his hands.

3179094,2,B000VKL6Z2,"You know you're watching a Rob Zombie film by the amount of facial hair, verbal abuse, domestic squalor and bar brawl ballads peppering the scenes. And ""Halloween"" doesn't disappoint in the opening act, with the stripper mom tossing breakfast plates at her deadbeat significant other, who in the space of less than a minute belittles an infant and lusts after the underage whore daughter. I call it Jerry Springer noir.

But when, soon after, young Michael Myers is shuffling from room to room mechanically killing everyone in his home on Halloween night, the action lacks tension. At which time I realized that without suspense, murder scenes come off as clinical, no more heart-racing than a knee operation. That wouldn't be so bad if, in between the psycho surgery, there was a healthy dose of witty, nihilistic hillbilly banter. But you get lines like, ""I know I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday"" that belong in intentionally stupid films like ""Snakes on a Plane.""

I was expecting Zombie to transport the Myers clan to the pork-fried South setting of his earlier films -- with haunted houses staffed by double-headed nuclear fallout survivors, day-glo basilisks and scuba-suited big-rig drivers high on meth and gasoline. The only actor who earns his paycheck actually is a trucker by the name of Big Joe Grizzley (Ken Foree), but he's rubbed out a few blinks after he's introduced -- although his outfit continues in his stead. The kid (Daeg Faerch) looks the part but his acting prep seemed to consist primarily of swigging 'Tussin a half-hour before someone yelled, ""Action."" Zombie broods over young Michael for such a significant amount of time that by the end, you're left wondering why he bothered at all when, just as in the original, Michael turns out to be no more than a mindless beast.

In an interview with Premiere before the film's release, Zombie compared the legend of Michael Myers to the ""Frankenstein"" story, itself based on Prometheus, giving John Carpenter's franchise much more credit than it deserves. But he goes on to say, ""My movie takes place as if no other movies ever existed. It's not connected to anything,"" a baffling statement because when ""Halloween's"" perspective switches from Michael to other characters in the ""present-day"" portion of the film, scenes looks as if they were lifted straight from the Carpenter version. This seems to be nothing more than an assignment to see if Zombie is ready for the washed-out big leagues.",1197158400,3,2473,4.968599033816425
3179095,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This is a great movie and is scary as hell. It's a remake to John Carpenters classic Halloween which came out in 1978. This movie starts out pretty by exploring more as to what drove Michael in to turning into a psycopatic killer. They basically show us how his relationships with his mother, stepfather, and sister which were not good at all aside from the mother. Michael being bullied at school also did not help.  Michael finally snapps from all of this and goes trick or treating. Malcolm Mcdowell plays Dr. Samual Loomis who tries to help the young Michael who is locked up at Smith Grove for the next 15 years. Then we move to Michael who is now grown up and doesn't talk at all. Loomis finally gives up on him because hes see no hope for helping him at all and moves on and writes a book on Michael. Michael of course escapes. Dr Loomis gets a call that he has escaped.  He knows where he is going to and tries to do anything to help and to stop him because he knows how dangerous he is. After this the second part of the movie beginns which is very similar to Carpentors except more gorier, more death scenes, and too much nudity.  Laurie and her friends are stalked by Michael and we also see Laurie's adoptive parents in this film. The movie moves pretty quickly from here where Michael goes trick or treating again and will kill anybody to get to her baby sister Laurie. It's very suspensful full and action packed so I won't give it away. Some of the bonus materials on the second disv which I found interesting were the deleted scenes, alternate ending, some parts of how the movie was made. Other bonus materials which people would find interesting are the bloopers, and the casting sessions. Overall I highly recommend this movie!!",1197072000,,1747,4.470219435736677

What set this movie apart from many of the other horror movies was that there were some actual story here, an explanation as to why Myers turned out like he did. There were some parts that were predictable, but there were also some parts that really made me jump. I rated this with only four stars because there was a little too much nudity. Sadly enough, there will always be the obligatory nudie scene, but Zombie went over the top on this one. I would recommend the DVD and a fast forward button when they show. As per usual, they don't add anything to the movie, only detract. If you can live with that though, this movie will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.",1196812800,3,777,4.328767123287672

This prequel/re-imaging had one fantastic scene during the first 10 minutes, and then it just fell apart and was exposed for the train wreck die hard Halloween fans were certain it would be.
  Michael myers now comes from a white trash family complete with an abusive pedophile stepfather. His sister a trash talking whore.(the whole family is trash talking) A pole dancing mother who was actually
redeemable(somewhat) and played very well by Zombie's wife. Malcolm McDowell has none of the hypnotic effect that the late Donald Pleasance had as DR. Sam Loomis. The grown Myers is an incredible bulk with catchers mits as hands, and just lumbers his way through this. The second re-imaging half just moves along at a frantic pace with no suspense or atmosphere, and is hardly frightening in the least. Many parts were laughed at in the theatre I was in.
  Trying to remake a classic timeless masterpiece of filmaking is like trying to change the laws of physics, it can't be done, and could actually be quite dangerous if tried. Still, after all is said, Rob Zombie made a ton of money for this thing, and it makes me want to consider giving up my day job and attempt to remake or re-image Rocky.",1196726400,3,1487,4.685823754789272
3179098,4,B000VKL6Z2,"And make no bones about it, the original masterpiece by John Carpenter did NOT need to be remade, however; this does go to show that on occasion, given some style and a slightly different approach, a remake can work (hey Hollywood, originality works even better!).  I begrudgingly went to see this (a friend offered me a free ticket so...), more out of curiosity and an urge to back up my preconceived notions that this would be utter garbage, rather than for enjoyment or entertainment purposes.  So just imagine my suprise when by the end of the film I was as giddy as a junior highschool boy with a pack of cigarettes and a porno magazine!  Director Rob Zombie actually brings enough unique and original material to the Michael Myers mythos that we understand (kinda) why he becomes what he ultimately becomes... an awesome and unstoppable killing machine!  Oddly enough though, this also works as a detracting factor, because although Rob does a nice job showing us an origin for one of the best (if not THE greatest) slasher icons of all time (which TCM: The Begining was completely inept at doing), in the end though, I still feel it was much creepier knowing less rather than more.  In Carpenter's original, Michael looks like a normal kid from a normal middle class family and you never know or understand why he did what he did on that fateful Halloween night... while in Zombie's version, Michael comes from a bad white trash family and is constantly under verbal and physical abuse from those around him.  Not nearly as suprising or shocking when he does finally lose it, in fact you end up almost rooting for him to let loose.  The movie provides considerably enough new material that if Rob had decided to rename the characters and change Myers into some other distinctive madman of his own creation he probably could have had an exciting new slasher franchise on his hands... but instead he put his own spin on Halloween, and he did a nice job of it.  Acting is top notch throughout (if not a little over done at times) and the killings are as realistic and brutal as I've seen in awhile (including a cringe worthy baseball bat to the head... several times!), plus thankfully Carpenter's original score also returns for some scenes.  This version is actually sleazier and more exploitative than the original (much like the equally excellent ""Hills Have Eyes"" remake was) and pushes the language, nudity, and graphic content way past it's predecessor (which the original didn't need to be a great movie but...) and helps it to stand on it's own two blood stained boots.  Not being particullarly fond of either Rob Zombie as a director OR remakes says quite allot for the film, and I've rarely had a better time watching a movie while simutaneously being transformed into a hypocrite!  I'd recommend this to any and all horror fans, not everyone will like it, but you might be suprised at how many of you will.  Also keep and eye out for the always great Ken Foree (original Dawn Of The Dead, From Beyond) as trucker Joe Grizzly in my favorite scene from the movie which features him on the toilet doing battle with a taco salad and Michael Myers (no really... I can't make this stuff up)!",1196726400,3,3201,4.686274509803922

I was hoping for more imagination than just a bunch of teenagers who we don't care anything about going around trying to get layed before getting killed. Useless sex, violence and language. Not very much of a reinvisionment if you ask me.  But we should have know, it was by Rob Zombie",1196553600,2,414,4.447368421052632

When I first heard that Rob Zombie would be doing a ""re-imagining"" of Carpenters original, I was, well, scared a little. I could deal with a sequel being bad, but going back and tampering with what made Michael Myers such a horror icon is pretty risky. After viewing the 11:00 show last night with a sold out crowd, I can tell you that Zombie sure did tamper with the movie. Hell, he gave it over a half-hour of insight into why Michael's childhood caused him to become a masked killer. In my opinion, it paid off. What made the original so great was the mystery of Michael Myers, you really had no idea why he did what he did and that made it creepier. What sets the tone of Zombie's version is how in your face the details of this kid are, its to the point where you are forced to feel creeped out, as if someone tied you down to the chair. After the insight and the institution days (which in my opinion, brilliantly tie some knots that Halloween fans should be pleased with) the movie cuts right to the chase, having an aura of the original and a fresh new feel at the same time. I do not want to give away any deaths (although I will say they are GRUESOME and mostly terrifying), big details or the ending, which some idiotic IMDb users do, but I can tell you that the twists in this film, especially towards the end will totally catch you off guard. As for the style of the film, I personally like Zombie's directing style, I think its unique and very much his and I was happy that he wasn't trying to copy Carpenter like so many other past directors have tried to with the Halloween Sequels. The casting was for the most part top notch. Expect to see some heavy hitters in the genre in little bit parts through out the film. To wrap this up, I was very pleased. The film screams at you, its right in your face whether you want it to be or not. If you can let your guard down and stop being so defensive of the original, you should enjoy yourself as much as I did. If you cant, a couple of months from now when your at blockbuster and these two films are side to side, you pick the one you prefer. Ill be picking both.",1196553600,8,2291,4.150561797752809

And if the Z-man ever makes another ""remake"" (as you all call it) of a classic horror flick, we all should know its going to be just as gritty and malicious as any of his films.  This movie was never meant to be compared with the original.  Not even in the same league or even in the same series.

This version kept us on the edge of our seats the entire time, from childhood to the very last scene.  Many say that the new Michael Myers was to big and unhuman like.  Well My son and I totally agree that the new Michael adds some realism to his accomplishments.  You have to be bigger and badder to do most of the throwing and stabbing that this guy did.  Some said it had more gore, again we both disagreed.  Rob hit it right on the head with the amount of gore, story, and filming.

3179114,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Few directors can be trusted to make a good slasher these days, let alone a good remake of any kind. Most  everybody else has moved on, lost their magic, or never had it in the first place.

This is all the more vital if one is going to tribute film patriarchs. Gus van Sant's version of Psycho is still contentious--an egotistical blasphemy as far as some buffs are concerned. Tom Savini's remake of Night of the Living Dead seems largely ignored, while Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is really a dumb Americanization of 28 Days Later. Important considerations if one presumes to remake that daddy of slasher films, Halloween.

Independent film master John Carpenter gave us the original, from a screenplay co-written with Debra Hill, and possibly inspired by Black Christmas. Dimension Films acquired the rights and after a string of terrible sequels, began looking to reboot the series. Along comes Rob Zombie.

Up front, forget this noise about ""re-envisioning,"" or ""remakes for a new generation"". I only care about good movies. Movies that love themselves and their audiences too. With an exception or two, Halloween is such a slasher movie.

Mainly because Zombie chucks out the supernatural canards in favor of a true crime sensibility. Nuts to that stuff about the curse of Samhain. The real horror comes from a dirt head little boy in a Kiss shirt, who takes enough abuse with too little love to become a psychopath. The first half of the movie charts Michael Meyer's transition into murder, complete with screaming parents, indifferent siblings, and schoolyard bullies. By the time school authorities discover evidence of the boy's madness, things become famously, dramatically too late.

Plenty of horror movies have a vignette or a toss-away speech to explain their villains. Rob Zombie spends two whole acts to show how Meyers is shaped by his environment to become The Shape. Along these lines he develops actual relationships between the killer and other people: notably that of his mother, a janitor, and Dr. Sam Loomis. The mother and doctor in particular play much longer and deeper roles than in the original film, contributing greatly to my interest. But even the sister and father get more screen time and development in terms of Michael's growing addiction to death.

That Zombie fills in gaps is another mark of the film's quality. We see when Michael finally crosses the line from a troubled boy to a speechless murder machine. How he escapes imprisonment. How Meyers acquires his mask and coveralls. How he knows to stalk the virgin babysitter Laurie and her not-so-virgin friends.

And stalk he does. For Zombie's vision is dark, literally as well as figuratively. A selective use of slow motion, sound effects, and low-end rhythms in the soundtrack evoke night-time terrors even during the day. It makes heavy use of source lighting to create thick shadows. For that matter, a lot of the sound is source-based too, and Zombie sometimes uses deep throated sirens or high pitched baby screams as a substitute for ambient music. The film itself is saturated to emphasize dark colors, and even broad daylight looks as if shot through a grimy window.

The blood is dark red to black, which probably helped this movie get an ""R"" instead of an ""NC-17"". It also helps that, as usual for horror movies, most of The Shape's victims are unsympathetic--it's always okay to kill cops, abusive dads, truckers, and sluts in the movies.  And as usual, we don't see the death of animals or little kids. We even get the old clich' of a loathsome punk being killed, to foreshadow another character's prowess. I don't knock the movie much for this, though, because *Halloween* comes from that sort of tradition. The most ""innocent"" victims are still portrayed as schmucks, and indeed one of the recurrent themes in Rob Zombie movies is that the public is too naive and ill-equipped to deal with psychos.

Speaking of violence and themes, Zombie eschews the current trend in dismemberments and arterial sprays. He also avoids the 1980's trend of lingering on the murder weapon as if it were a phallus. Instead, Mike Meyers lands fierce, rapid blows; he does not stab so much as bludgeon. And while he does not torture his victims, they die more painfully and terror-stricken than in *Hostel*. Because where Zombie does linger is the moment of expiration, and so *Halloween* is a death fan's delight. People gurgle and twitch in bathtub-sized pools of blood, as their killer looks them in their bulging eyes... Typically, the majority of time the camera skips over a death scene is when the victim is an animal.

Indeed, the one big sin of this film is not brutality, but boredom. The Shape kills at least 21 characters before I lost count, most of them extras or cameos. I began to tire around 17. The pursuit of the Laurie character dragged further, with multiple escapes and captures and false deaths. I never got the sense that Zombie was aware of how much the story dragged in the last half-hour, and I can think of at least three murders scenes he could have shaved to improve the pace.

So I liked the first half of the movie, which consisted mainly of original material and real shocks, than the more derivative second. Otherwise, it's a damn sight better than any other horror remake I've seen. Most of them suck because they are produced or filmed by people with no competency or love for the source material.

Like Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth, Rob Zombie combines a respect for his roots with the ability to apply them. The result is a remake that becomes its own classic.",1196294400,,5591,4.853095487932844

I thought it was a damn good horror movie. But not as scary as the original. Which is fine, seeing as it's not a remake. It was gory enough for me. I actually liked the main character (Laurie), which is rare in horror movies these days. The only complaint I really have with this movie is that Mike Myers was too big and strong. But on the whole, the movie was exactly what I was expecting it to be.",1196294400,3,698,3.9574468085106385
3179116,4,B000VKL6Z2,"As a true long-time fan of the original Carpenter ""Halloween"", and a true skeptic of most of the current remakes of classics, I was a little hesitant about wanting to see this remake.  However, knowing that if I disliked it I could just erase it from memory, I went in to the theater to see this with an open mind.  I also kept in mind that as long as the original is still available to be seen, it DOESN'T MATTER if the remake was not up to par.  The original is still there to be seen.  I have to say that after seeing Rob Zombie's vision of this story, I was blown away.  I was a huge fan of ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"", and was definitely NOT disappointed in the re-imagining of the Michael Myers story.

That being said, I have to say I honestly do not know what people who loathe this reinvention expected.  There is such hatred towards this movie that I do not understand.  If anyone has seen any of Rob Zombie's previous works, they should have known going in that this was going to be a BRUTAL and graphically realistic movie.  The comparisons to Carpenter's building of suspense are baffling....Zombie is known for the more ""in your face"" brutality and edginess...nothing else should have been expected.

If you're familiar with Zombie's previous works, you will love this movie.  If you want the more subtle, subdued suspense that the 1978 original offered (which I also loved), then this is probably not the movie for you.  However, if you've not seen the Rob Zombie ""Halloween"", please do not post a negative review just on what you've heard or what you've felt about the remake UNLESS you HAVE seen it.  I feel there are a lot of posts on here from people who haven't seen it and just want to give it negative reviews based on the fact that they are upset that a remake of the classic was done.",1196208000,10,1831,4.429850746268657
3179117,1,B000VKL6Z2,"For one, I am a big fan of the original. I think it's a masterpiece. Michael Myers, as a character, truly scares the crap out of me. When I heard Zombie was going to do a remake of this classic, at first I was appalled, but then I saw the Devil's Rejects and my apprehensions were quickly allayed. Then the trailer came out in the spring, after seeing that... Halloween(2007) quickly became my most anticipated movie of the year over everything else.

Aug 31st rolls around, I catch the midnight show, the theatre is packed and pumped for a good scarin'... ten minutes roll by and my head is ringing with the words 'oh no, this can't be happening.' The first hour rolls by and I'm slumping in my seat, thinking there might be some hope. The 90 minute mark rolls by and my hand is covering my mouth, not by the terror of what's unfolding on screen, but by the stark realization that I'm probably watching the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The credits pop up and my jaw just hits the floor at the stench of awfulness this movie exudes.

Piss poor direction. Piss poor acting from everyone(I'm talking to you Malcolm McDowell) involved. Piss poor writing. Piss poor cinematography. Not only is this movie poorly made, but it's just not scary... AT ALL!!!!!

What makes this movie tragic is the fact that Rob Zombie is a 42 year old horror junkie who has been around the block. In his interviews he seems like a guy who knows what he's talking about. You would think his life experience would translate into a piece of work that was unique. Not so.

And for those who support this flick then I have to come to the conclusion that 1) You don't know anything about Horror movies. 2)You really don't know anything about Horror movies. 3) You TRULY don't know anything about Horror movies.

Rob Zombie, in my mind, has made the first Horror movie for the mentally challenged. It's akin to watching a fecal clogged toilet bowl in a grimy public restroom. This movie could actually be a litmus test for judging one's character.

Yet I encourage everyone to see it if they're interested in filmmaking as a cautionary tale of what not to do when crafting a story. It's toxic ineptitude almost has to be seen to be believed. You were warned.",1196208000,15,2239,4.488943488943489

History:

I am one of the originals who saw the birth of Michael Myers in the theatre. The first has been and always will be the best. I was not thrilled with 2. I thought 4 was a great return but 5 crash and burned. 6 I felt was pretty good but the shadow of Donald dying while making the film made it a little sad to watch. 7 went back to basics. I liked it. 8 was a joke.

I own a Michael Myers outfit that I wear every year. Michael in his own way has become part of my mythology.

When they announced the restart I was furious. I wanted to burn Hollywood down. Then they named Rob Zombie to helm the film and I took a step back. I have always preached that the only good restarts were made by those who has a true love of the original. Rob Zombie is one of those artists.

So in trying to keep a level head I saw the film.

Unfortunately:

My viewing of the film was damaged by two idiots who kept talking on their cell phone and the theatre lights came on before the movie was over so I will be seeing this movie again.

My review of the film is slow in coming because I really wanted to sit back and think about the film. Not rush to any judgements.

The Review:

I really liked what I saw.

As a filmmaker Rob Zombie is truly growing. After viewing The Devil's Rejects I compared his style to Sam Peckinpah. Never playing it safe. In your face with the violence. And most important, great script and well-defined characters.

No matter how small the role you remember who each character is. What they do. Their personality. Even if they are on the screen for just 2 minutes you remember them. This is a great gift to scripting.

Another thing Rob Zombie excels at is film score. The music he chooses enhances the scene. Never commands it. I did like how he used cuts from the first Halloween and Halloween 4.

The camera and cinematography was gritty matching the feel.

The cast was excellent. The ones that really stood out were:

Sheri Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers (Michael's Mother). She gave a depth to her performance that I really have not seen from her before. Very sad as the mother trying to keep her family together.

Daeg Faerch as young Michael. He changes from child to monster were outstanding.

William Forsythe as Ronnie White (Deborah Myers live in abusive boyfriend). This man could make a monster out of a nun.

Danny Trejo as Ismael Cruz (Hospital Worker). You felt his caring and fear of Michael.

As for the main two characters:
Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Samuel Loomis: The character was totally rewritten. Which to me was a good thing. Donald Pleasence had created a tortured Ahab hunting down the evil that he felt only he understood. I could not see anyone going in the same direction and giving the character justice. What Rob did and Malcolm gave a very good performance with was making Loomis more of a researcher. An explorer of the mind. New ways to cure. As the film went along Loomis could see more and more the primeval force inside Michael. And towards the end he realizes the great error he made in how to handle Michael which I will talk about later.

Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. Tyler has been around for a few films but he may have finally made his mark with Michael. He let his presence speak for him. He did not over due the role. I will easily rank him as one of the best to portray Michael Myers.

The script:

My first thought after the film was ""This ain't your Daddy's Halloween"". Rob Zombie made a wise move in not trying to duplicate the original but instead made his own mark on the legend. Yes. It is grittier and bloodier then the first and surprisingly I did not have a problem with that. There was a method to anyone Michael killed. A reason behind every action. Not just some random body count. To Michael, those he killed were not innocent.

Another wise move was to base the whole film on Michael. In the original we had Dr. Loomis and the three babysitters as the main focus with Michael always being in the background. Again, to try to base the film on the originals would have been disappointing. Instead we get a full look at Michael. What drove him. His reasons. His rage. The one downside to this is you loose the mystique of Michael. But Rob only has one unused direction to take this film and so that had to be sacrificed. What we do get in its place is an unstoppable force of rage. In this film Michael is the purest form of Monster in human form.

As for what drove him. I am fascinated by his psychological reasons to the killing. From the school bully to the hatred of his sister and her flaunting the sex. The whole family slaughter was based on his love for his mother and baby sister. He systematically removed everything that prevented him from having a happy family life. His mother and baby sister were literally the only two women that could be in Michael's life. All others reminded him of his older sister.

I really enjoyed the way the masks were used in the film. Thinking that he was hiding the ugly when in fact the mask was enhancing the monster in him.

Another drive to Michael which fueled his rage and I really wonder if anyone else picked up on this, was his abandonment. People he loved were leaving him. His mother's death. Dr. Loomis giving up and leaving after they had built this strange friendship. Ismael Cruz retiring from the hospital. The only worker that had treated Michael with respect. Which all lead up to the rage that erupted when he finally confronted his sister without his mask and then her trying to kill him. Everything he was. Everything he did lead up to that key moment. She was all he had left and she rejected him destroying any hope for Michael.

The film left the door wide open for a sequel. It will be interesting what direction they go for next.

I give it a 4 out of 5 and consider it a very worthy companion to the Halloween films.",1196035200,7,5896,4.358904109589041
3179119,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been a die hard fan of the classic for a long time (ever since I saw it during its broadcast debut on NBC in 1981).  However, I say, without shame, that I like this reimaging.  I say reimaging rather than remake because it was intended to be a different movie than the original.  I love the fact that they spent more time on young Michael, and the actor that portrayed him did a wonderful job.  There was a creepy yet sympathetic element to his performance, not unlike Sissy Spacek's role in Carrie.  The casting of the giant Tyler Mane was also a good move.  He towered over everyone and the scenes in the institution with the orange mask were chilling.  Alot of people missed the point of some of the plot changes, but, to me, that is what made the movie good.

I will say if you go into this movie expecting a classic on par with John Carpenter's film, you may be disappointed.  If you go into this movie with an open mind, you may enjoy it more.  Do not go into it ready to pick out the differences, if so you will miss the point of the film entirely.  It is more brutal and has more nudity and profanity than the original,so be prepared for that.

The bottom line is that I liked it.  It is not John Carpenter's Halloween, it's Rob Zombie's Halloween.  If you want to see the classic, then watch the original.  If you want to see a reimaging, then watch the new version.  The choice is yours.",1195948800,11,1404,4.241509433962264
3179120,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob Zombie's re-visioning of the original classic 'Halloween' completely strips it of what it once was and stood for.  Our pal Michael was a silent, stealthy, suspenseful and tricky lad back in the day, hiding in the shadows and laying traps for his victims.  Back then, he represented a more subtle horror icon over his buddies Jason and Freddy.
Enter the new Michael, complete with a back story.  Zombie paints a killer whose redneck family abused him and whose young compassion is stripped by seemingly mindless violence.  The mystery behind Michael is completely thrwarted by Zombie, who feels it necessary to expose Michael as an everyday human being, unlike Carpenters 'The Child is just plain evil' theory.
Twelve or thirteen killings later, we have the older Michael, built like  WWF wrestler and a senseless killing machine.  Murder, sex, murder, cameo, murder, sex, murder, etc.  Blah, blah, blah.  Timing is terrible in this movie and there is no suspense.  You know everyone is going to die and you don't care about any of them.  Michael becomes a bore and laughable as well.  The old bush scene and laundry line scene are replaced by myers just standing around in broad daylight while the three young girls look across the street at him.
The ending is hardly memorable and the movie overall is a complete mess.  I liked some things about the rawness of 'House of 1,000 Corpses' and the 'Devils Rejects', but this film has nothing to borrow from them and ends up killing a classic.  It's a good slasher film if you can forget everything you know about Michael Myers and Halloween.  I, unfortunately, cannot easily forget.  And I will not forgive Mr. Zombie for such a worthless, effortless and talent-less re-visioning of an immortal horror classic.  If you can't stick to the basics of good horror, such as suspense, sympathy for the characters and overall intrigue, stick to music or your infamous 'Texas Chainsaw', um, I mean 'Devil's Rejects'movies.",1195948800,15,1965,4.927051671732523
3179121,4,B000VKL6Z2,"This is another classic hit remade by Rob Zombie.  I've noticed in all of his films he carries his cast around; this one, House of a 1000 Corpses, Devil's Rejects... they all seem to play a vital role.  I like the back story to Michael Myers that Rob Zombie came up with.  It's very important to establish where or how someone became who they are today and I think Rob did a nice job in showing us why Michael is Michael.  His home life not being so great, his mother played by none other than Sheri Moon (Rob's wife) is a exotic dancer, the father figure is a pig, and his sister is your normal average teenage daughter... it's like what a life.

On another note, I don't know if any one was aware that the character Annie Brackett, Lori Strodes best friend is played by none other than Danielle Harris who also plays as young Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.  At first glance she was just another Hollywood face but when I looked closer I noticed that she played the little girl in 4 & 5 that was out at the farm house where there was the party and people were being killed one by one.  It's kind of ironic that Zombie would pick her, knowing she had a history with Halloween.  Plus for her to be killed and pratically nude in the 2007 movie, shows that closure was needed somehow.  But that's my opinion.

All and all, I enjoyed this horror flick.... as I am a HORROR Lover.  It's very hard to find horror movies so moving to slasher flicks is the next best move.",1195516800,2,1536,4.2620689655172415

I would like to express my opinion of the movie. First, I was eight when the original came out and was probably ten or eleven when I saw it for the first time. I was horrified, but it has become one of my favorite horror films. It is a classic, and probably will always be the best one. Over the years as greedy producers tried to squeeze every penny out of this franchise, the quality of the movies has dropped. No version will ever cause the tension and fear of the original. But with all the sequels, some large holes in the story were created. This movie at least gets the whole Laurie Strode story in order instead of the original, making us wonder why he singled her out. This gives him a purpose to come back. I loved the fact that so much time was used showing Michael develop. The whole ""born-evil"" is fine, but give him a reason to snap. I like the fact you can see him grow into this monster, and feel that maybe, if he had a ""normal"" family, they could have stopped him. It makes him more of a tragic character, instead of a one dimentional horror mold. You get to see him evolve into what he becomes, from killing small rats, to his family. I love the way you see him evolve at the institution. Becoming silent, and then the fixation with the masks. It helps define him. Then he escapes and the rest of the movie follows the original without all the dragging. (It does drag in some places.) And Dr Loomis is more of a real character. Selfish and looking out for himself. (You also don't have the over-the-top acting. ""Death has come to your town Sheriff"".  And if you don't understand the whole kneeling and acting submissive to Lorie, it was because she was the only person he ever loved and when he was locked up as a child and still talked, all he ever wanted, was to go home. So he went home and brought her there so they could be a family. Then she stabbed him and he lost any good still in him and went ""to the dark side"" (I'm surprised no one accused zombie of ripping-off Star Wars #3) Again, I love the original and no movie under the name ""Halloween"" will EVER be as good. But this is a re-telling through Zombie's eyes, and I like the fact he gives us more of a back story and shows us the evolution of the Michael Myers character. It shouldn't be the same as the original. But it pays tribute to the original, with a modern edge. (Kevin Smith doing a remake of Goodfellas would be very different from the original) So please, give the movie a chance. Let it stand on it's own without constant comparison to the original. And I'm not a ""Horror Professor"", but I watch a lot of Horror films, and nothing could be worse than Busta saying, ""Trick or treat, mother f'er!"" as he Kung-fu's Michael.",1194998400,14,2868,4.291512915129151

3179138,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I have been a fan of the horror genre since I was young.  As a teenager, friends and I would sometimes pull all-night horror marathons and have a blast.  It was never the mindless slasher nonsense that drew us in, but the smart, well-crafted films with both suspense and true scares.  The list that meet these criteria is a short one, ranging from the original Exorcist from 1973 to modern classics like Session 9 and even May.  Some of our most cherished, however, have been part of the Halloween series.

John Carpenter's original Halloween and Rick Rosenthal's respectable sequel are both classic greats in the horror world.  Most of the sequels that followed were questionable at best.  And when something is done well, imitation is expected.  Countless film makers have tried to compete with the likes of Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street or Alien.  Naturally, almost none of the films these have inspired turned out to be memorable.  But then a terrible thing happened in 1998 that opened a door that never should have been opened.  They remade Psycho.  Those of you who watched Gus Van Sant's film know what it was.  It was a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece as well as to audiences everywhere.  It was an attempt to bring the greatest psychological thriller in cinema history to a whole new generation.  And why did it fail so miserably?  Was it the director?  The actors?  The script (which was almost word-for-word the original)?  No.  It failed because you can't remake a classic.  That is precisely what makes them classics.

When the previews for a Halloween remake directed by Rob Zombie came out, I was really excited.  Having bought both House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, I had a fair amount of faith in Zombie's ""new take on a classic legend.""  Zombie has proved to be a man willing and unafraid to push the limits in both music and movies far past what regular (read: boring) audiences are used to.  So I watched it.  I was intrigued.  I kept watching.  Pretty different alright, I thought.  But as the movie went on, and differences mounted, I began to feel a little discouraged.  Was I just watching another bad slasher movie?  The f-bomb was being used way to much, everyone the killer saw was being slaughtered, the nudity was needlessly excessive and the only suspense came from wondering when and if it would get better.  It didn't.  Rob Zombie pillaged Carpenter's legacy by turning a scary story into a run-of-the-mill piece of trash no different from the likes of Wrong Turn or Rest Stop.

Trust me.  Trust me.  Rob Zombie is still cool and I will certainly not allow this one failure to keep me from checking out his next project.  I gave Halloween 2 stars instead of 1 because, hey, he tried.  But Beware.  This movie will disappoint anyone looking for more than just blood and guts.

Rob Zombie's update has succeeded in mangling virtually every element, to the point that there isn't a single thing right in it.

I'll first address those who rail against we who post negative critiques, saying that we just need an open mind and we need to be willing to see a new interpretation:
Bull.
I have no problem with new interpretations as a concept, but a classic of the genre, a film that is one of the pinnacles of suspense horror deserves a better turn that to be ""re-envisioned"" into this execrable waste.

Let's start picking:

The backstory - way, WAY too long, for starters.  I guess it's possible that it could have been more stereotypical and less intersting, but off hand I can't imagine how.  Okay, so we all now know that abusive and dysfunctional upbringing can lead to torture of small animals, which is a warning sign that the subject may tend towards homicidal tendencies as an adult.  Got it.  Thanks.  Do we really need to spend 60% of the film hashing this out?

Plus, the grossest flaw of this backstory is that it belittles and de-mystifies the character of Michael Meyers entirely, not to mention that the terribly inappropriate casting of Tyler Mane doubles this damage.

Why is he doing these things?  What drives his evil?  How is he so physically powerful for having the build of anybody else?  How the hell can he sit up and keep coming after having a knitting needle rammed into his throat?  According to the 1978 original, we'll never know, and that's why he's scary.
`The Shape', the creepy guy in the overalls with the cheesy mask, could have been anybody.  He grew up in an apparently normal household, showed no signs of danger right up until he put the knife to his sister and her boyfriend.  As an adult, he's not physically remarkable in any way.  Just an average guy.  There is no reason or explanation for his murderous ways, he simply does it, and that's all that needs to be known.  And the fact that he doesn't seem remotely excited or amped up about doing what he's doing - he just does his thing.  He simply IS the Boogeyman.

By showing us a kid who was almost engineered to be a psycho-killer, and having him grow up to be that huge, it's obvious that he's a juggernaut of mayhem.  Of course, a knitting needle to the throat isn't going to put him down, and it's a reasonable assumption that he'll take more bullets than any gun can carry before he'll start showing any effect.  The fact that he flies into violent rages diminishes him, too.  Of course, I'd be scared if that monster was coming at me.  I'd be scared if I was staked out on a railroad track with the daily freight bearing down on me - doesn't necessarily mean that it will make for good entertainment; nor does it mean that it's appropriate in a movie that should play up vaguely supernatural associations with the date of Halloween.

Now let's compare the two renditions of Dr Loomis.
Donald Pleasance's portrayal showed a man haunted by his failure as a psychologist, an otherwise brilliant man who just never could get through to this boy of pure evil, and that mark against him has clearly had an effect on his psyche.  Through this, though, there's still some humor left in him, as when he scares Lonny away from the house and grins to himself as the boy scampers off.
Malcolm McDowell gives the depth of someone who's just read his lines for the first time just before the camera rolled.  I don't fault Mr McDowell for this, I fault the script and direction.  His Dr Loomis shows no real connection to anyone else in the film; he acts panicked at times, slightly brooding at others, but we never get the sense that he's anything other than just a guy who's known Michael since he was a boy, and has come to regard him as scary.  He's more like a pep coach, aware of the ghastly failure last time, but let's give it another go anyway, shall we?

Another flaw the backstory brings to the table is this:  By the time we get to the modern day with the night of horrors the movie's supposed to be about, there's no time to give any kind of depth to any of the characters.  We don't care about them, we just want them to shut up and stop screaming.  Laurie elicits no sympathy as all her friends are dying around her, because we haven't gotten a chance to get to know her or anybody else.  By the time they're introduced, there's just enough time now for Michael to come to town and start slashing.

The biggest flaw of all is the completely inept handling of what should be a masterpiece of suspense.  That's what the 1978 version was about - suspense and tension.  Rob Zombie has bludgeoned those ideas altogether, and his movie is just about brutality and gore.  Sure, that gets uncomfortable to watch after a while, but it's not scary.  It's not horror.  It's just watching unedited news reels of murder scenes.  This type of filmmaking works fine for ""House of 1,000 Corpses"", because the theme of god-awful brutality is what that movie's about.  But not ""Halloween"".  ""Halloween"" is supposed to be about terror, tension, suspense.

Nothing in Rob Zombie's butchery is remotely scary.  The only reason I was getting tense is that I was hoping it would end soon.  There is no buildup, there is no development, there is only the cheap thrill of some over-the-top violence.  Prolonged shots of somebody screaming and bleeding are not scary.

I enjoy his music, and ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is a guilty pleasure movie I'll load up now and again, but I have never been so disappointed in a movie until this.  Especially considering what a comprehensive horror aficionado Rob is.
I expected something much, much better.

Bottom line:
If the depth of your horror interests goes no further than the recent trend of torture-flicks like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"", you'll probably dig this.  If something with some atmosphere and good acting is more your style, steer WAY clear of this turkey.",1194393600,4,5967,4.591682419659735

Harsh critics of this film need to take that lesson to heart. Horror is not meant to be something that society sees as tasteful or neccesary. Just what kind of gruesome deaths are tasteful? Was Janet Leighs death in Psycho tasteful because you never see the knife piercing the skin? What difference does it make? She died. Audiences are used to seeing that and that is the reason that kind of P.C horror is no longer suspenseful nor scary. If a little blood and guts is too much for you then maybe you should stick to the more ""safe"" fare such as SCREAM.

Rob Zombie took a character that had become a cliche and unscary and kicked him back into the fearful monster that he is. Yes, the movie spent less time on stalking and more time on killing. How long would a killer stand there and watch you before he made his move? He's there and he strikes. He doesn't wait around for you to put your clothes back on before he does the deed.

3179149,1,B000VKL6Z2,"In early September, I went to the theater to see Rob Zombie's 2007 version of Halloween, and despite my reservations over the very notion of a remake of the 1978 classic--Not to mention a few controversies along the way--I wanted to give the film a fair shake...

Put simply--the update is a mess and really makes you appreciate the genius of John Carpenter and Debra Hill back in '78.

As a 10 year old child, Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) brutally kills his sister Judith (Hanna Hall) and his stepfather (William Forsythe). Shortly thereafter, young Michael is put in an asylum and placed under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).

Years later, the boy, now an emotionless catatonic man has escaped back to his hometown of Haddonfield to complete the murderous rampage. that began all of those years ago. Now, the adult Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) is back, and his hometown is about to find out that there is no escape from pure evil.

One of the strengths of the Carpenter version of Halloween is its ability to scare viewers using suspense and shock-without having to depend on gore--to tell its story. While I realize Zombie wanted to make the 2007 flick as different as possible, having no desire to make a shot for shot retread, his film uses blood and gore to make up for the fact that his film is just NOT scary.

Even though Zombie keeps the framework of the story in tact, he wastes golden chances to scare us--with the new stuff. As I feared, knowing too much of Myers' backstory just weighs everything down like an anchor. I wouldn't have minded spending 40 minutes learning how screwed up little Mikey's home life is....but frankly, as presented it's quite uninteresting.

The series already tried explaining the Shape's origin in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers with mixed results (see Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, the Producers' Cut for more details). I agree with the Carpenter/Hill approach that ""less is more""-allowing the audience to guess at the killers whys--rather than leading us there--keeping him a mythological figure or evil force--more or less...

Once the film moves into more familiar terrain though, most of that material is either dropped all together or truncated to get to its new conclusion

I actually feel bad for the cast of the movie. Everyone gives it their best shot, but thanks to bad writing by Zombie--most of the characters are given stiff and silly dialogue to utter--with the F-Word thrown in for good measure--a lot.

Many of the movie's great supporting players are wasted here. Dee Wallace, playing Mrs. Strode is introduced quickly and has only one really meaty scene after that... Danielle Harris (who is well known to the franchise faithful having played Jaime Lloyd in both Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5) plays Annie, fares a bit better with screen time but deserves better material.

When I first heard that Malcolm McDowell would be playing Dr Sam Loomis, as a fan of most of his work, I actually was pretty jazzed. It's a shame that his performance only serves to further exalt the way the late Donald Pleasence played the doc through 5 films. Sure, there was a touch of camp the way Pleasence did things, but it never got in the way of you totally buying into it full on. McDowell is not very subtle when chewing the scenery and serves as a major distraction.

Scout Taylor-Compton playing the pivitol role of Laurie Strode isn't given enough time for the part to make her the star that it made Jamie Lee Curtis almost 30 years ago.

Zombie turns the simple killer stalks babysitter premise into a bloody version of a daytime talk show or violent ""After School Special""

Thank goodness, Halloween 2007 has no chance of ever becoming the true classic, that is the original.",1193702400,11,3778,4.78494623655914
3179150,1,B000VKL6Z2,"We arrived at the theater early to get good seats.  Rob Zombie's new rendition of the classic ""Halloween"" had been hyped for weeks on the Internet, television, and in magazines so it was all we could think about.  My wife and I (being devoted fans of the 1978 classic) wanted to be first in line to see just how close the publicity was to the actual delivery.  Is ""re-imaging"" the perfect modern horror film a good idea?  We had mixed feelings on that but nonetheless remained unbiased and anxious to see what Rob Zombie had in store for us.  Sure, his past films didn't exactly amount to anything worthwhile but maybe he worked that out of his system, and this was Halloween.  He at least had a good storyline to draw from.  We sat discussing the many avenues the film could take, watching the small group of other moviegoers take their seat for the matinee showing.  The glow from the projection booth kicked on, the crowd fell silent,  the lights dimmed.

Expecting something intriguing for the opening credits and remembering how stylistic John Carpenter had been with his slow tracking shot of the flickering jack-o`-lantern with credits rolling to the right, I couldn't wait to see how this new remake started.  Excitement quickly gave way to disappointment.  The film simply kicks off with a simple shot of the Myers house being thrown in the audience face complete with the onset of Rob Zombie's blaring, classic rock soundtrack.  I couldn't help but sigh out loud with a sense of  pessimistic foreshadowing ...would this opening scene set the pace for the rest of the film?  I sincerely hoped not.

Next, and in typical Rob Zombie fashion, we are introduced to the loud, obnoxious, vulgar, screaming, white-trash characters in the film.  It was about this point I abandoned all hope of this even coming close to the original and realized this was going to be just another typical Rob Zombie shoutfest, complete with excessive gore, shock value gimmicks, unsteady camera movements, endless close-ups and stereotypical characters including another shameless plug for his wife.  The only difference is this time he had the Halloween name to deceive and lure an audience with.

Lacking any subtle sickness of the original film the movie chugs along as scattered as a shotgun blast.  Rob Zombie attempts to add some backstory to the Michael Myers character but in doing so eliminates any mystery surrounding his presence,  making him just another knife-wielding killer who pops up to slash and kill...slash and kill...slash and kill...

Even the veteran actor  Malcolm McDowell, in his role of Dr. Loomis, can't save this run-of-the-mill Zombie zero.  The character who was so powerfully played by Donald Pleasance in 1978 is now lacking in recklessness determination and intensity.  He is reduced to a soft spoken, school psychiatrist who actually befriends Michael as a child and then just gets lost in the mix as another faceless character/victim.

Although this movie doesn't follow the same predictable suit as its countless sequels, it seems  Mr. Zombie is almost incapable of creating suspense.  Genuinely frightening moments are substituted for unnecessary (and comedic) amounts of carnage, blood, and gore.  The movie feels rushed, paying no attention to mood or atmosphere.  The camera continues to erratically bounce around as Michael Myers keeps popping up so fast I lost track of certain scene settings.  Asking myself, ""Wait...what house are we in now...wasn't he just down the street two seconds ago?""  Characters continue to talk but speak their lines on top of each other and with such speed I actually started laughing at one point.

As the film concluded and the credits began to roll people began to exit the theatre.  I couldn't help but notice the looks of disappointment on  the audience faces as they were leaving.

In a nation of full of trendy PG-13 rated horror films I can respect what Rob Zombie is doing to make a no-I-won't-tone-it-down statement but his in-your-face style of directing doesn't (to say the least) transfer over to this genre very well.  It seems he is just more interested in getting a reaction out of people then creating a good film, which is very sad considering the potential this project had.

Bottom line:  If you are a fan of the original ""Halloween"" you will be insulted by this remake.  Rob Zombie's self-important vision of a classic might play well with today's younger and more gullible teenage audience but for longtime Halloween addicts (and everyone else for that matter) this film is sure to disappoint.",1193616000,114,4571,4.971014492753623
3179151,3,B000VKL6Z2,"OK first off I wasn't expecting too much when I first saw this film.  I wasn't watching it with a note pad and pencil closely examining every discrepancy with the original film nor did I expect it to stand up to the original but then to be honest I didn't really care.

I watched it as an entertaining slasher movie just as the original was.  I guess some people forget that the director commentated that his son loved the films so much because when he took a girl to the movies she would cling hold of him during the scary moments.  I guess some forgot that the original film was designed to entertain and I seriously doubt that too many went to watch it and then came out of cinema describing it as a cinematic masterpiece along side Lawrence of Arabia or Casablanca.

The film starts off with Young Michael's troubled childhood in what I would guess is a small town somewhere.  His mother is a pole dancer, his father? a drunk, wife/kid beater who seems to give his every breath to abusing all around him, his sister while probably the better of the bunch is a bit of a ahem 'girl around town'

Michael carves up small furry animals in his spare time and gets bullied by the local kids eventually getting pushed too far when he gets found out taking various dead things to school (as you do) He takes his revenge on one of his bullies in the most horrific of ways (The scene lasts so long it is pretty disturbing) and then decided to chop up the family (well you know the rest)

The film goes on to chronicle his stay in a mental institution and the reason why he constantly wears a mask (another reviewer has already pointed out why he has taken up the mask he became famous for) carrying out one more horrific attack before making good his escape (in the most unbelievable of ways) picks up a new set of clothes and his trademark knife in an equally ridiculous way, (he was walking around in his slippers and dressing gown prior to that (now why would anyone notice a 6 foot 6 hippie in his dressing gown wandering around the streets?)) and then heads for his home town to kill a few folks.

So begins pretty much a re-run of the original Halloween film.  Few naked babes, lots of blood, Michael appearing and disappearing whenever the mood takes him and his former shrink running about the place flapping while the local police wander about aimlessly.

Horror films are not supposed to have amazing plots they should frighten, shock, disgust and sometimes amuse the audience and this film does a fairly good job. Much of it makes absolutely no sense at all (Michael breaking his chains at will, taking out all who stand before him etc etc) But the same could be said for the original.  Yeh there were discrepancies with the time like but really, this is a horror film I guess if I wanted to be intellectually stimulated by a film I would have gone for a French flick set in a Parisian apartment where some middle aged artist 'analyzes' sex for 2 hours but I didn't I just wanted a bit of cheap gore and I got it.

Not a bad little remake, just don't take it too seriously.",1192924800,3,3078,4.388400702987698
3179152,2,B000VKL6Z2,"I have to admit that I love the original Halloween movie and enjoyed some of the sequels ( 4,5 and H20).
I was really looking forward to this remake but must admit I was put off some when I heard that Rob Zombie was picked as director.
The first half of the movie is all about young Michael and how he became the killer he is. I would have liked it more but am I the only one that does not think that the constant use of the ""F"" bomb does not make for either compelling dialoge or good story telling.
More than half way through the movie we get to the rush job of the original story which does not allow for any character developement. Parts of it was more intense than the original but you certainly cannot care about this Laurie as much as the original Jamie Curtis Laurie.
I beg for no sequel to this movie, but rather a true remake that respects the original. One that actually had a story line and lots less unnecessary nudity and did not come close to topping 100 ""F"" bombs. Please!

3179163,5,B000VKL6Z2,"This film has its own unique testure of being a classic. I loved how Rob Zombie consulted the original creaters of Halloween. The start of the movie is excellently portraid with Michael being a kid. As the progresses, you can see the evil cosuming Michael. In the original Halloween, Michael's parents are portraid as lawabiding citizens. However in this movie they are far from lawabiding. The film went into depth of Michael's adolecent and childhood years. I do not want to go into depth to what the movie is about, but is an instant classic for an original remake. The film creaters fly through the parts that simulate the original Halloween scenes of Dr Loomis, Laurie, Annie, and Linda. Truly must see for an slasher fan.",1192579200,3,727,4.777777777777778

Everyone has picked apart the characters, and role casting....even the story...but noone has really acknowledted that this is a NEW version of the original Halloween...as far as the original series is concerned. I think everyone goes into it being biased because the original will never ever be duplicated, but c'mon. Give it a chance!

I found it interesting to see Myers as a child. I admit, Laurie was a bit too ""bouncy"", but in the end she was great. The scream....what a release!

Unfortunately, like the original movie....the original Dr. Loomis will never be duplicated. I think they cast as best they could....thank about Anthony Hopkins....superb actor, but would've been too typecast and cliche for that role.

Rob Zombie is a genius film-maker...if you don't have a love for his movie-style, than maybe you won't appreciate Halloween. But, I have to say Devil's Rejects was an awesome movie...one of the best horror flicks I have ever seen. It's like nothing you've seen before. I like that about Zombie...he goes beyond the norm.

So, if you're debating about this movie...my best piece of advice...go into it open-minded. Don't expect the 1978 Halloween.....expect the 2007 Halloween. Enjoy fellow horror-fans! I sure did!",1192492800,6,1476,5.237288135593221

So for anyone who did not like this one instead of trying to tell people not to watch just let them see it & decide for themselves if they like it .,1192406400,3,415,3.6741573033707864
3179166,4,B000VKL6Z2,"If you check history, you will find that John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" did not come out the gate a critics' darling or a financial success; according to late producer/cowriter Debra Hill, the initial reactions ""were brutal."" Ironic, then, how it has since developed a revered following (though I'm honestly not a big fan) that most people today think was always the case.

I bring this up because Rob Zombie's remake--in addition to being the shot in the arm the franchise desperately needs--will likely have the same fate; years down the road, I think it will be valued on the same level as the ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" remakes. While Zombie's film is jagged in spots, with narrative jumps (where did Loomis get the cop car? how does Michael get to Haddonfield from the middle-of-nowhere truck stop?) and plain-view continuity errors (some of which were probably inspired by the ill-advised Weinstein Bros. reshoots), the filmmaker has brought a pathos to this human monster that is more rich and fulfilling than any of the films prior (yes, I'm including the original).

What seems to offend ""Halloween"" purists most is the mere principle of Zombie's undertaking--how DARE he remake a CLASSIC--instead of looking at the film in the broader scope of things: would you rather see Michael Myers going head-to-head with Busta Rhymes? How about a continuation of that desperate Celtic mumbo-jumbo? Zombie's position was inarguably unglamorous, no doubt realizing as many people would embrace his film as decry it. For my tastes, he has brought an angle that fuses popular serial killer lore with the sense of tragedy that marked the classic Universal Monsters--it's a tricky feat, but by introducing us to pint-size Michael (Daeg Faerch) and spending time with him, his adult counterpart--while a ruthless machine of brutality--possesses the faint traces of humanity that marked Frankenstein's Monster, or the Wolf Man. In many ways, his ultimate downfall is as tragic as the atrocities he commits. And THAT is what ultimately transcends all in ""Halloween""--putting a face and motive to what was once a mere in-the-shadows specter of ""evil.""

The first half of the film provides a satisfying, creatively-filmed backstory (I'm anxiously awaiting the additional scenes being restored for the upcoming DVD), wherein we get an overview of young Michael, his fatal deeds, and his time in Smith's Grove, under the watch of Dr. Sam Loomis (a well-cast Malcolm McDowell). Only in the second half does ""Halloween"" kick into full-blown remake mode, with gritty renderings of scenes from Carpenter's film; despite this, Zombie manages to put his own spin on traditional scares, adding a visceral edge and urgency to death. I actually appreciated the truncated characterizations of Laurie (the immensely likable Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda (Kristina Klebe), and Annie (""Halloween 4/5"" vet Danielle Harris), since their interactions in the original are what ultimately dulled it down for me; here, Zombie gives us a quick introduction (just enough time to get a feel for the characters) before getting down to business. And while the ""sex=death"" equation here is hardly inspired, it certainly beats the torture-device-laden-labyrinth of another ""Saw"" film.

Zombie treats the material with a great deal of reverence and respect, and utilizes a reality-focused style to establish a proper tone (imagine the dustbowl squalor of ""The Devil's Rejects"" brought to suburbia); the death scenes are filmed with unflinching brutality, yet seldom feel exaggerated. Time will tell, but to me, ""Halloween"" is a more than worthy addition to the pantheon of great remakes (and horror films in general).",1192233600,28,3688,5.277683134582624
3179167,5,B000VKL6Z2,"I think this new take on John Carpenter's Halloween is very well done.  It gives lots of scares and suspense.  Malcolm McDowell does a good job portraying Dr. Sam Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton is very good as Laurie Strode.  If you love horror movies, you should definately own this DVD.

3179170,1,B000VKL6Z2,"... it has to sting when another director ""kills"" your crowning achievement.

Here's the thing: I had actually read the horrendous critical reviews of Zombie's film and thought, ""When have critics ever understood horror?"" So, in a weird way, I guess I have only myself to blame ...

As someone who teaches horror-film theory and horror-film studies, I know what will endure the ages and what will not. Still, I'm not some jaded academic. I love horror ... the more (figuratively) visceral, the better. Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B00009UW0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;(1978) is well-respected by film scholars (even the snobbiest!) for a reason: it manages to inspire terror with little on-screen bloodshed ... much like Hooper's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>&nbsp;(1974).  Neither of these works necessitate a remake. And, while Nispel's 2003 revisit of ""TCM"" elicited tension and revulsion (both good), Zombie's ""Halloween"" only elicited anger.

Foremost, the film is technically unpolished. At one point, the viewer becomes convinced that Loomis (McDowell) is responsible for Myers's adult outbursts. In early therapy sessions, Loomis and Myers both wear black ... it becomes the topic of their conversation. It draws a parallel between the two. Then, Loomis pens an account of his experience with Myers and begins a book-tour. The scene opens with a projection of Myers' face ... and as Loomis utters ""Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, they absence of light, these are of a psychopath"" the camera moves to an extreme close-up of Loomis' eyes. So for the entire film, the viewer waits for the ""other shoe to drop"" ... for Loomis to confess some (perhaps ""unconscious"") involvement in Myers' now silent rage. But this never happens ... so one is led to ask, why create these parallels and then fail to complete the message? At best, we may discover the connection in the director's cut ... at worst, it was a really unforgivable error in filming.

The casting of Myers is horrendous. Why make him physically monstrous? Carpender's original casting of Nick Castle was clever (tall but muscular), Zombie's casting of WWF/WCW wrestler Tyler Mane (6'8 and grotesquely built) was all too literal. Carpender's Myers terrifies audiences without having to appear physically extraordinary ... he is ""The Shape"" (for those in the know) ... not ""The Lumbering Blob.""

Moreover, by providing one of the most wretched back-stories I have ever witnessed, Zombie destroys Carpenter's most gruesome message ... some people are born evil. This is why Donner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen/dp/B000EYK4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen</a>&nbsp;(1976) was so gripping. Damien was born evil ... no amount of compassion (mother's love/father's love) could alter that which was encoded on the child's DNA (if you will). To make Myers' a product of his environment ... well, that's just obvious. I forgot, was this a film or an after-school special?

These are the most unbelievably painful problems ... I'll not even launch into the needless deaths of several adults who DO NOT warrant such treatment (by logic and theory). Or Zombie's vile treatment of a ""Halloween"" cult-favorite like Danielle Harris (creepy, but in a pathetic way). Maybe Zombie thought he was evolving the genre ... maybe he thought was modernizing Carpenter's work ... maybe he needs to mature (but he's already forty-five) and learn from the masters (like Carpenter and Hooper): less is better.

So, I return to my original question ... ""When have critics ever understood horror?"" I guess I must have forgot that the critics were blown-away by Romero's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>&nbsp;(1978), raved over Kubrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shining/dp/B00005ATQJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shining</a>&nbsp;(1980), lauded Hooper's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poltergeist/dp/B000V4UFZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poltergeist</a>&nbsp;(1982), gushed over Shyamalan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;(1999), and loved Boyle's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;(2003). I guess they have always known what constitutes film worthy of an audience. Next time, I hope I will take my cue from these professionals ... and, I sincerely hope Zombie will do likewise.",1191024000,15,4987,6.769110764430577
3179171,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Ok, everyone is bashing this film as if it actually is the worst of the series, yet in reality it really isn't that bad. First of all, you have to understand this fim is not a sequel of Halloween Resurrection nor any other Halloween film. Along with the late great Moustapha Akkad (God rest his soul)the original Halloween series has died. Lets face it Halloween fans, the 8th and final film (Halloween: Resurrection) was an embarassment and there was absolutley no where else to go with the franchise. Thus the film by Rob Zombie, who was charged to re-invent this franchice in his own image WITH may i add the blessing of John Carpenter who acually LIKES the film. Carpenter and all loyal Halloween fans know that his film will NEVER be topped and no one should have expected Zombie's film to do so.

ok after my pleading intro lets look at the good, the bad, and the down right ugly. If you are familiar with Rob Zombie's first two film's (House of 1000 Corpes) and (The Devil's Rejects) you will understand the opening scence of this film is vintage Zombie. The slutty sister, trailer trashy house, useless stepfather, and out of this world profanity with words you never knew exzisted....That's just Zombie. The great thing about the film is that it actually does spend some time in Michael's childhood, an element Carpenter left out of the original. The bad about the childhood scenes are they still just leave us all dumbfounded as to why Myer's becomes a killer. One minute little Michael is eating candy, next he's got duck tape a knife and a metal baseball bat. The mental hospital scences show Michael slowly turn into just a silent kid who has a mask obsession and it just doesn't make much sense (probably what they wanted). Let me say though Daeg Faerch was the perfect actor to select for the child Myers. This kid has got talent and is scary looking! Awesome performance kid.

Adult Michael: Tyler Maine is a decent actor at best and I believe he should have did a Jason movie rather than a Myers film. A 7ft Michael Myers actually took away from the suspense because it was just too much of a radical transformation. We see little Daeg Faerch, a fifteen years later sign, and then 7 ft Maine. We are used to seeing Myers as a stalker, pacient, never quick to make the kill. This Myers is explosive and never seems to actually stalk his prey, and as stated in a previous review we don't really see him just stare at his victums and do his signature head tilt. Although we do get a scence where he is spinning a body around in circles which is actually kind of funny. Overall Maine did an exceptional job, I'm sure he was just following the script, I doubt there was much study of the original Myers being as this was a new direction film.

Dr. Loomis: ok this is where I was most disapointed with the film, I'm a die hard fan of the Halloween series I saw this movie 3 times in 2 days. We all know Malcolm McDowell is a legend amoung actors, but when it comes to this role I challenge his range. Most people believe the role of Myers himself is the most important, however Carpenter will even tell you he was most excited when Donald Pleasence joined his cast for the original film. Words cannot describe the way Donald Pleasence played the role of Loomis, to this day when you say his name people will only know Pleasence as Sam Loomis. His composure, vocabulary, and overall look just made him perfect for the part, and it is those traits McDowell just didn't display. The only other actor who could have pulled that role off today I believe is Anothony Hopkins, McDowell just failed to deliver what I thought from Pleasence to be oscar worthy performaces.

The Ugly: ok you get a scence with a guy that calls himself ""Big Joe Grizzly"" it's just for laughs, and is pretty funny, but completly unnecessary. Laurie strode's role was tarnished in the film but replacing Jaimee Lee Curtis is practicly impossible so understandable. Scout Taylor-Compton was not terrible in the movie, the way her role was scripted in the movie was. And finally the role of Dr. Loomis as I stated in the paragraph above, just a complete failure.

Overall this film is pretty good, definitely the best film Zombie has ever made. His previous 2 were gorefest meaningless films but I think he captured a new vision of Halloween and if there is a sequal he's started us in the right direction. Listen to the score of this film, Zombie does an exellent job using the original music from the first 5 films (excluding Halloween 3 of course). He also uses a couple familar scences from the original, sheet ghost scene where Myers hands Linda a beer. Again just keep in mind this is a new direction the producers are going with the Halloween franchise, people will compare it with the first film which is not the way this film was intended, it is NOT a re-make, if anything this movie will make people want to go out and see the original. John Carpenter's legendary masterpeice STILL reigns supreme. The cast did a great job, actress Scout Taylor-Compton has a great set of screaming pipes on her and does a fine job. Note worthy is the return of Danielle Harris all grown up from playing the neice of Myers in 4 and 5, as well as Brad Dourif who is the voice of Chucky from the Child's Play series, In this film he plays the Sherrif. Halloween fans, Buy the dvd, it is a must have for the collection, and everyone else this movie IS worth the 2 hours, I recommend watching the original first to see the differences.",1191024000,5,5503,4.5155466399197595
3179172,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Yes, this is worse than ""Halloween 6"" when we find out that Michael kills because he is a member of a Druid Cult. Yes, this is worse than ""Halloween Resurrection"" when we see Michael get beat down by Busta Rhymes wearing a Myers mask. And yes, this is worse than ""Halloween 5"" when Michael shows his sensitive side and cries when his niece calls him ""uncle"".

""Halloween 2007"" is the absolute nadir of the ""Halloween"" series, and manages to make the aforementioned films look good by comparison.

In this new movie we find out that Michael kills because the kids in school made fun of him because his mommy is a pole dancer, his stepdad calls him a name that rhymes with ""maggot"", and his big sister didn't take him trick-or-treating (give me Druid Cults any day). We find out that he steals the classic mask from his big sister's burnout boyfriend who wears it first and makes doofus noises when doing so (and you thought Busta Rhymes wearing a Myers mask was bad?). And we find out that he has a sensitive side when he confronts Laurie, drops his knife, falls to his knees, droops his head, takes off his mask, and hands Laurie a photo of the two of them as children (this has to be seen to be believed, but could have been a lot worse since the original screenplay had Michael repeating the word ""Boo"" over and over again since this was his nickname for Laurie - yes, the writer/director actually wanted to show Michael talking as an adult). Give me Michael crying in ""Halloween 5"" any day over this.

Gone is the sweet-natured and innocent Laurie. Instead we have an unsympathetic Laurie who makes fun of the kids she is supposed to care for, and who makes sex jokes with food. Gone is the obsessive Dr. Loomis who knows that Michael's return means Death for Haddonfield. Instead we get a new Loomis who, when asked by the Sheriff why Michael has returned, says ""I don't know, but it can't be good"" and says to his murderous patient as he attempts to kill Laurie, ""Michael, it's me Samuel"" - you can't make up bad dialogue like this.

And gone is the mysterious and creepy Michael Myers - the child who killed his sister, and didn't speak a word after doing so. No scene of his mask slowly appearing in the darkness behind Laurie. No scene of him sitting up in the backround and turning his head to face Laurie. No scene of him tilting his head at a victim he just killed.  No scenes of him in the backround, like a ghost, appearing and disappearing. None of these iconic scenes are referenced.

Instead we see Michael as a child, talking and saying things like ""Happy Halloween, Boo""- can't make this up, people. We see child Myers screaming when he kills, and wearing the classic Myers mask and looking like a bobble-head doll. And we see him having a pity-party when his mom pole dances and he misses out on trick-or-treating, while the '70s rock ballad ""Love Hurts"" plays in the backround. Amateur film-making at it's worst.

As an adult, we see a 7 foot tall Michael wearing an orange paper pumpkin mask (again, you can't make this up) looking like a member of the band Slipknot or the wrestler Kane, and behaving like Jason when he punches guards in the face. We get some clumsy scenes of the girls seeing Michael watching them, but these scenes are so poorly realized that they look like outtakes from ""Halloween 5"". And the new mask Michael wears, with the rotted look and scars, is a pathetic update to the classic Shatner mask.

This new Michael Myers also likes to knock on bathroom stalls, hand a can of beer to a girl, and hold out photos to people (he does this twice). And he likes to drag people around a lot.

This film has no Halloween atmosphere whatsoever, and it looks like the props were bought at Halloween Adventure, with plastic pumpkins, and in one case a wreath on the door of one of the houses. And to make matters worse, we get a first - Christmas in a ""Halloween"" movie. Only Tim Burton is allowed to pull that one off.

And plot inconsistencies galore: Since Myers doesn't drive in this one, exactly how does he get from the hospital to the truck stop, and from the truck stop to Haddonfield? How does he get a 500 pound tombstone from the cemetery to his basement? How does he know who teenager Laurie is since the last time he saw her she was a baby? And how does the sheriff know the adopted baby was Laurie - was there only one baby on the market during that 3 month period and aren't these records confidential anyway?

The attempts at gore fall flat - a character has his eyes gouged out, but when Michael drags his body we see that his eyes look fine. A topless female character gets stabbed in the chest, and it's obvious the director thinks this is a shocking scene since he shows us repeated shots of her lying on the ground screaming, but it's not effective since her acting is dismal (""LAAAURRRIIIEEEE""), and no attempt was made to make it look like she has stab wounds - it looks like they just smeared stage blood on her chest, well, because that's exactly all they did.

The music by Tyler Bates is good, and reworks all of the classic themes from the first movie, however, some of the cues are used at inappropriate times - we first hear the classic main title, not during the opening credits, but 15 minutes later when child Myers is running out of school. The song ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" is used twice just before a character is killed, no subtlety whatsoever.

This is an embarrassing train-wreck of a movie, a weird amalgam of other films in the series (the sister storyline and the song ""Mr. Sandman"" is from ""Halloween 2"", Danielle Harris starred in Parts 4 & 5, and other scenes seem to reference other sequels), and is so bad that it almost feels like the director had contempt for the source material and wanted to make as horrible a parody as possible.

Upon its release, this film, which was not screened for critics, did break box office records for Labor Day Weekend (it opened on 3,500 screens, almost twice the number of screens for a regular release), but the second week earnings are important since they indicate if a film ""has legs"" - earnings dropped a huge 69% second week for this, the largest drop for any movie in the top ten that week, and show that bad word of mouth was starting to get around.

Here's a list of things that you'll either love (providing you have an I.Q. under 75), or hate (providing you have reasonable intelligence):

Michael speaks as a child and says things like ""Happy Halloween, Boo"".

You get to see Michael Myers as a kid wearing the classic white mask with his pajamas - he looks exactly like a Michael Myers bobble-head doll.

You see Michael as an adult wearing a home-made orange paper pumpkin mask, a bathrobe, and a pair of slippers.

Michael as an adult ""cruising"" in the men's room looking for some action.  Not *that* kind of action, he's not a Republican Senator, he just needs some new coveralls since his bathrobe won't match the updated classic mask.

Loomis saying things like ""I don't know but it can't be good"" when asked why Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Shouldn't his Doctor know why he came back?

Loomis saying ""Michael, it's me Samuel"" when he sees Michael attacking Laurie.

Loomis saying ""Michael, hell, no, Jesus"" when Michael attacks Laurie again.

Loomis showing the Sheriff the cover of his true crime paperback entitled ""The Devil's Eyes"" - the closeup of the cover is hilarious - Michael as a kid doing his best Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining"" scary stare.

Misplaced music cues. The classic main title played 15 minutes later when Michael is running from school. And ""Laurie's Theme"" played whenever Laurie is not around. And let's play ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" *twice* before murder scenes, so clever. Did a 14 year old direct this?

Michael holding out a photo to Laurie's mom, like a cop, why didn't he just say ""have you seen this girl""?

Michael finding Laurie as an adult and knowing who she is even though he hasn't seen her since she was a baby.

Michael the new Criss Angel - he can get from the hospital to Haddonfield without a car, and transport a 500 pound tombstone from the cemetery with no car.

Michael dropping the knife, falling to his knees, taking off his mask, and *holding out a photo* to Laurie. In the original screenplay, he spoke and said ""Boo, Boo, Boo"" over and over again, but it was cut.

This is the worst film in the series and makes ""Halloween 5"" look good by comparison.",1190764800,13,2190,4.6640625
3179174,1,B000VKL6Z2,"Yes, this is worse than ""Halloween 6"" when we find out that Michael kills because he is a member of a Druid Cult. Yes, this is worse than ""Halloween Resurrection"" when we see Michael get beat down by Busta Rhymes wearing a Myers mask. And yes, this is worse than ""Halloween 5"" when Michael shows his sensitive side and cries when his niece calls him ""uncle"".

""Halloween 2007"" is the absolute nadir of the ""Halloween"" series, and manages to make the aforementioned films look good by comparison.

In this new movie we find out that Michael kills because the kids in school made fun of him because his mommy is a pole dancer, his stepdad calls him a name that rhymes with ""maggot"", and his big sister didn't take him trick-or-treating (give me Druid Cults any day). We find out that he steals the classic mask from his big sister's burnout boyfriend who wears it first and makes doofus noises when doing so (and you thought Busta Rhymes wearing a Myers mask was bad?). And we find out that he has a sensitive side when he confronts Laurie, drops his knife, falls to his knees, droops his head, takes off his mask, and hands Laurie a photo of the two of them as children (this has to be seen to be believed, but could have been a lot worse since the original screenplay had Michael repeating the word ""Boo"" over and over again since this was his nickname for Laurie - yes, the writer/director actually wanted to show Michael talking as an adult). Give me Michael crying in ""Halloween 5"" anyday over this.

Gone is the sweet-natured and innocent Laurie. Instead we have an unsympathetic Laurie who makes fun of the kids she is supposed to care for, and who makes sex jokes with food. Gone is the obsessive Dr. Loomis who knows that Michael's return means Death for Haddonfield. Instead we get a new Loomis who, when asked by the Sheriff why Michael has returned, says ""I don't know, but it can't be good"" and says to his murderous patient as he attempts to kill Laurie, ""Michael, it's me Samuel"" - you can't make up bad dialogue like this.

And gone is the mysterious and creepy Michael Myers - the child who killed his sister, and didn't speak a word after doing so. No scene of his mask slowly appearing in the darkness behind Laurie. No scene of him sitting up in the backround and turning his head to face Laurie. No scene of him tilting his head at a victim he just killed.  No scenes of him in the backround, like a ghost, appearing and disappearing. None of these iconic scenes are referenced.

Instead we see Michael as a child, talking and saying things like ""Happy Halloween, Boo""- can't make this up, people. We see child Myers screaming when he kills, and wearing the classic Myers mask and looking like a bobble-head doll. And we see him having a pity-party when his mom pole dances and he misses out on trick-or-treating, while the '70s rock ballad ""Love Hurts"" plays in the backround. Amateur film-making at it's worst.

As an adult, we see a 7 foot tall Michael wearing an orange paper pumpkin mask (again, you can't make this up) looking like a member of the band Slipknot or the wrestler Kane, and behaving like Jason when he punches guards in the face. We get some clumsy scenes of the girls seeing Michael watching them, but these scenes are so poorly realized that they look like outtakes from ""Halloween 5"". And the new mask Michael wears, with the rotted look and scars, is a pathetic update to the classic Shatner mask.

This new Michael Myers also likes to knock on bathroom stalls, hand a can of beer to a girl, and hold out photos to people (he does this twice). And he likes to drag people around a lot.

This film has no Halloween atmosphere whatsoever, and it looks like the props were bought at Halloween Adventure, with plastic pumpkins, and in one case a wreath on the door of one of the houses. And to make matters worse, we get a first - Christmas in a ""Halloween"" movie. Only Tim Burton is allowed to pull that one off.

And plot inconsistencies galore: Since Myers doesn't drive in this one, exactly how does he get from the hospital to the truck stop, and from the truck stop to Haddonfield? How does he get a 500 pound tombstone from the cemetery to his basement? How does he know who teenager Laurie is since the last time he saw her she was a baby? And how does the sheriff know the adopted baby was Laurie - was there only one baby on the market during that 3 month period and aren't these records confidential anyway?

The attempts at gore fall flat - a character has his eyes gouged out, but when Michael drags his body we see that his eyes look fine. A topless female character gets stabbed in the chest, and it's obvious the director thinks this is a shocking scene since he shows us repeated shots of her lying on the ground screaming, but it's not effective since her acting is dismal (""LAAAURRRIIIEEEE""), and no attempt was made to make it look like she has stab wounds - it looks like they just smeared stage blood on her chest, well, because that's exactly all they did.

The music by Tyler Bates is good, and reworks all of the classic themes from the first movie, however, some of the cues are used at inappropriate times - we first hear the classic main title, not during the opening credits, but 15 minutes later when child Myers is running out of school.

  I was a teenager when the first Halloween (starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) was out and about, now I'm a mature man with a grown daughter, but I still enjoy the scare of a good horror film.
  I have seen all of the other 8 ""Halloween"" films, but this Rob Zombie's Halloween had constant cursing that disenchanted me and I found the first act and second act less suspenseful than the original John Carpenter's ""Halloween"".
  This 2007 version does give you insight to why Michael Myers killed as a child.  In this version, 10-year old Michael's (Daeg Faerch) home life is not the best. His mother, Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and the house appears to be unkept. Her boyfriend, Ronnie, (William Forsythe) lives in the house and argues and shows no respect towards 10-year old Michael (Daeg Faerch).
  In the original 1978 version, the two-story house was so immaculate, the parents were older and of middle class.
  Dare I say, this 2007 film does reflect the way some young people are today and we know of the dysfunctional parents in this day and age too. It makes this film all the more difficult to watch.
  When young Michael becomes maniac due to the kids bothering him in school and the abusive nature of his mother's boyfriend, Michael kills his school enemy Wesley (Daryl Sabara), Ronnie, Judith, his own sister (Hanna R. Hall) and her boyfriend, Steve (Adam Weisman). he leaves his baby sister, Laurie Strode, alive.
  Laurie Strode as a teenager is played by Scout Taylor-Compton, now in the role made famous by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original ""Halloween"" movies.
  This film does not overshadow the cinematography and direction of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), which is still the best scare and suspense of any Halloween film.
  While Rob Zombie's adult ""Michael Myers"" is more giant, grisly and brutal (played by Tyler Mane), Zombie did open my eyes and made a very daring motion in the final act.
  We all know of the chilling ending in the original Halloween (1978), but director/writer Rob Zombie went even further and beyond this point for 15 more minutes. The climax that Rob Zombie added to his ending was very new, fresh and so suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat.  The last 15 minutes surprised me and the last minute twist was fantastic. It left you wanting more.

3179177,3,B000VKL6Z2,"Michael Myers (Faerch) is a kid destined for trouble.  His mom (Zombie) and her boyfriend (Forsythe) are terrible parent figures.  Pushed to the brink, he eventually snaps.  One Halloween, he dons a mask and attacks a school bully.  Then he heads home to kill his family.  The only survivors are his mother and infant sister Laurie.  Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (McDowell).  Loomis eventually realizes he is dealing with pure evil in Michael.  Fifteen years later, on Halloween, Michael (Man) escapes from the sanitarium and heads home to Haddonfield to find his sister, and finish the job he started years before.

""Halloween"" does some things really well, and some things really poorly.  The result is an average movie that in no way eclipses the original.  The good includes Tyler Mane as the grown up Michael.  Finally played by an actual actor, Michael is menacing and really scary.  It's also nice to see familiar scenes from the original.  That, along with the original's music makes the film feel close to the original at times.  Unfortunately, with 45 minutes devoted to backstory that took about 10 minutes in the original, the meat of the story feels compressed and rushed.  There is no building up to the final showdown.  It feels like the movie is one continuous murder after the other.  Lastly, the ending is terrible, without any of the creepiness of the original.  Yes, it has been changed, and not for the better.  Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is an interesting take on the original, but is deeply flawed.

3179178,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Wow, there is alot of slander about this film flying all over the internet. This film was cursed from the start. A remake of a classic horror movie like Halloween is a daring and risky move! The man in the drivers seat...Rob Zombie. An interesting choice for a director but none the less the film was doomed right from the start. ""Die hard fans"" of the original (like myself) were astonished that Malek Akkad would dare and copy the original classic! But wait a second...the sequels have gotten very stale. Is this the appropriate direction? All in all Rob Zombie's version of Halloween is an entirely different film from the original. I think it was pretty smart to change the direction of the film some so one does make the same mistake that Gus Van Sant did with ""Psycho"". Now the question: Was the remake better than the original? The answer is - No way, not even close! However, this film compliments the original very well. I was surprised with the quality of the film as Rob Zombie is a fairly good director. The film was filled with foul language, nudity and alot of gore! As any good horror movie should be! The casting was well done. Apparently Rob Zombie used the entire cast from his previous movie in Halloween, but I have not seen either of his other two movies, so I don't care in the least. The girl playing Laurie was well cast. Finally Laurie was attractive! Malcolm McDowell as Loomis was brilliant and I loved him in the role. Still nowhere near as good as Donald Pleasence but again, who expected him to be? The back story written into the movie was well done. The little boy who played young Michael Myers managed to creep me out, so that says alot. Michael who is like 10 feet tall in this version is scary again. The ending can go either way for the fans. I happened to LOVE the ending myself, but I am clearly in the minority here! Before you pass judgement on this film, see it. The film BANKED in the theaters and the inevitible sequel is sure to follow.

3179180,3,B000VKL6Z2,"When it was announced last year that rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie would be helming a remake of John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" it was met with mixed reactions. Some balked at the idea of remaking such a vital and iconic movie, while others were anxious to see what such a unique character as Rob could do with the material. Count me in the latter. It helps being a fan of his music from the beginning, but also take into consideration how poor the past few ""Halloween"" movies have been. If anyone were to remake it, could it turn out any better than Rob Zombie's? Even after watching it twice, and both times being frustrated with it's lack of focus, I still say the answer to that question is most certainly ""no.""

We all know the story of the Boogeyman, The Shape, or quite simply, Michael Myers. So to do a shot-for-shot remake (ala ""Psycho"") or anything of the like would be silly. Which is exactly where the trouble with this movie lies. ""Halloween 2007,"" as I will refer to it from here-on-out, plays like two very different movies fused together. First, we have Rob's vision. A Michael Myers with a story. He might not be given much motivation, but what Rob gives us in the first half is not only intriguing and disturbing, but actually refreshing when compared to the sequels. This is where he truly makes his mark and reinvents Michael Myers as we know him. About 45 minutes into the movie, however, it takes a turn. From out of nowhere, Rob starts rushing into a lazy remake of the original movie's events. We are introduced to Laurie Strode, this time played by fresh-faced Scout Taylor-Compton, along with Annie (played by Danielle Harris, making a bold return to the series) and Linda (Kristina Klebe). The three girls spout off lines from the original in such an off-handed way that you feel like you're watching an amateur film-maker fresh out of his first high school film-making class. To say the dialogue is terrible would be an understatement: it cripples the second half of the second movie completely! Virtually nothing in the second half of the film is effective. The kids are routinely dispatched in such a careless way. Some characters die after only being in the movie for a matter of moments. There is no character development for the second half, so it's hard to feel any tension. It was nice to see Rob recreate some memorable moments in his own way, and Danielle Harris has some truly unforgettable moments with Michael, but other than that, it's a dud, and as someone who awaited this movie with baited breath (a big ""Halloween"" nut and Rob Zombie fan, mind you), I found myself yawning from time to time in the last half. And let's not even get into it's dud of an ending. Had Rob Zombie stuck with what he had established in the first half and forgotten about paying tribute to the original movie (or whatever he was trying to do) in the second half, the results could have been much, much better.

On a more positive note, it sports an impressive cast. Not only is it satisfying to see Danielle Harris once again facing Michael Myers, but Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"") is about the best they could have done to replace Donald Pleasence and Sam Loomis. Brad ""Chucky"" Dourif, as Sheriff Brackett, is spot on, but unfortunately gets very little time. Just about everyone involved in ""The Devil's Rejects"" gets a part, from Bill Moseley, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie, who takes advantage of her role as Michael's mom and surprisingly goes against the stereotype she has been built up to. Danny Trejo, however, was the biggest surprise, and his parts with Michael are those that work best. His fate serves as the best example of Michael's lack of reason or mercy, and truly makes him a horror villian to be reckoned with and may be enough to send chills down the spines of even the biggest horror fans. Daeg Faerch, who plays a young Michael Myers, is also a nice surprise, as kids in horror movies can tend to be annoying. Yet, he turns in a very creepy and very believeable performance of a very disturbed young boy.

The movie, on the whole, looks gorgeous. Rob obviously knows his stuff, but the major problem is in the script. At times, the movie feels incomplete, and at others, it feels like he is making it up as he goes along. It goes without saying that the original didn't need to be remade, as it is still effective to this day, so if a ""re-telling"" was neccessary, why didn't Rob make it his own? Like ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers,"" you can literally smell the studio interference here. The movie not only makes little sense, but feels incomplete and rushed. What starts off as an intriguing and refreshing take on a well-known character, eventually degrades itself into boring drivel. It's painful to say it, but Rob's vision of ""Halloween"" hardly pans out any better than the dismal ""H20"" or ""Resurrection."" Even those watching who don't know the original should sense that something is wrong here. It's like Rob Zombie either didn't have the confidence to make this his own, or didn't really want to make the film in the first place.",1189382400,,5131,4.667403314917127
3179181,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Halloween (2007) Director Rob Zombie seems to be no stranger to serial killer/horror genre after past projects (e.g., The Devil's Rejects (2005) and House of 1000 Corpses (2003)) that have focused on similar themes.  However, remaking a cinema classic such as the John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween is no ""walk in the park"" given the film's established cult following.

But Rob Zombie seemed up to the task with an excellent screenplay that focuses on Michael Myers troubled beginnings as an 8-year old child from a broken home; his fetish for masks; as well as the subsequent homicides, fratricide, and to some extent--matricide--as his mother committed suicide following Myers initially killing spree. These horrific and visually graphic events (the film has been Rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and terror throughout, sexual content, graphic nudity and language.) eventually lead to Myers incarceration at Smith's Grove Sanitarium for the next 15 years.

Upon his inadvertent liberation at the hands of a decadent watchman and his equally obtuse cousin, Myers picks up where he left off, spilling carnage along his path until he comes face-to-face with his younger sister and former physician Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell; Star Trek: Generations).

Much like most slasher-flicks of the past, Halloween (2007) does not present a fresh take on this age-old formula. Instead, the average moviegoer's interest may be piqued by the director's vision and take on the ""selectively mute"" (and I use this term very loosely) Michael Myers.",1189382400,3,1543,5.337448559670782

I love how some scene's Zombie shakes the camera with the the music being intense while Michael is attacking someone. The lighting and sound effects are brilliant. The back story of young Michael is creepy and makes him more human instead of some guy just in a mask killing people who is invincible.

3179184,5,B000VKL6Z2,"First of all, I think Rob Zombie is just getting better and better at this. Afterall, I thought the best he had to offer was ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" but this movie exceeded all expectations that I had. Secondly, I am pleasantly surprised to see that his wife Sherry Moon Zombie can actually act which I was highly doubtful of in the beginning. To be quite honest, I don't know if this movie can be considered a remake or a prequel, but maybe, it's Zombie's vision of Michael Myers, and this was his take on the story. Thus, giving the audience an understanding of why Michael Myers is the monster that he is. Personally, I think Rob Zombie's mission is to breathe life back into the horror genre that has been dead and buried for some time now thanks to the lack of originality by ""the powers that be."" I believe his mission has been accomplished with this version of Halloween. This movie is not some ""teen slasher"" fluke, nor is it for for the squeamish at all, and it's the closest thing you'll find to scary these days. It starts off showing Michael Myers as a 10 year old boy. Michael's mother is a stripper, his stepfather is abusive, and his older sister is a slut. Michael is also tormented at school by fellow classmates. In fact, the only things that Michael finds any solice in, is torturing and killing animals and his ability to create masks. The only person Michael even relates to is his baby sister. On Halloween, Michael snaps by beating one of his bullies to death in the woods behind the school. Later on that night, he kills his stepfather, sister, and her boyfriend after they refuse to take him trick or treating. After that, Michael is institutionalized for having no knowledge of even commiting these murders. I think we all know the rest of the story from here. At any rate, this movie goes inside the mind of one of the sickest, most brutal killers of all time. I hate to have to spoil some of the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the one reasons I don't think this is a prequel or a remake because Michael kills Dr. Loomis in this one, and we all know for this to be a prequel or a remake that can't be possible. Other than that small detail.. I LOVED IT!",1189209600,3,2223,4.38498789346247
3179185,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Rob, you've had me frustrated with this film from the very beginning. The fact it was being made, that you were doing it, and then the horrendous reviews that were coming in from critics and ""online"" people. I went into the movie expecting the worst after reading these so called ""reviews"", and I came out very happy. No movie in recent memory has had me frustrated, nor have I been so led astray from online communities I usually believe. Rob Zombie's interpretation of the 1978 John Carpenter original is by no means a masterpiece. It is flawed, it has cliches, it has holes big enough to drive a semi thru, and parts that expect you to defy all logic. That being said, it was an interesting ride. You all know the story, so no need to get into that. The second the movie starts, it's a bit jarring. It is definitley a Rob Zombie movie, but definitley not a Halloween movie. Things get better once little Michael starts to snap. I was not a fan of the redneck, hillbilly, white trash section of this film, but it gets good when Michael finally flips. Plus, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingy emotional and touching in places. William Forsythe?. Well, he's William Forsythe. The second section, at Smith's Grove, is quite interesting. Michael's break out is a little too easy, but riveting nonetheless. The third section, where things really take us to ""Halloween"" land, is not a ""shot by shot remake"" that others would lead you to believe. There are some dialogue lifted from the original, and some classic scenes are recreated. However, most of these recreated scenes have a different touch to them, and this half also has new scenes, outcomes, directions, and so on, that cancel out ALL claims that it is a shot by shot remake. Zombie always keeps things interesting and interesting looking, if not some of the characters. He has littered the movie from start to finish with numerous decorations, pumpkins, and trick or treaters, to make this movie feel more like Halloween than even the original, and a number of the sequels. The three teenage girls are a problem. The Laurie character is no Jamie Lee, but she doesn't quite get as short changed as the other two, especially the Linda character. This part of the film felt a bit rushed and poorly thought out. At least Danielle Harris is still beautiful!. Malcolm McDowell is a welcomed Loomis. Once you see him and hear his voice, you realize that there is no other person but him who could of been Loomis. As for Tyler Mane, I was ready to hate his Michael, but I didn't. I still think he's too big, but he was effective and creepy in places. Brad Dourif was a fun choice for Sheriff Brackett, but like other B movie veterans, he is underused and discarded not long after he's introduced. The violence makes Carpenter's original look PG rated. Brutal violence like this has it's place, but I don't care for it in a Halloween movie. That being said, it didn't take me out of the picture as stated by other critics. However, I did feel a scene here and there were quite pointless and were just there to be extreme and hardcore, as if Rob couldn't dream up some scares so he wanted to just jolt people again. The score is teriffic. Bits of Carpetner's original are here and there, as well as Tyler Bates' own. Folks, this isn't the hatchet job a lot of Zombie haters and Halloween purists(of which I am one)are ballyhooing about. It's a very strong and interesting film that had me hooked from start to finish. There is no denying that nothing will ever top or match Carpenter's scary classic, but this was probably the best Halloween since the original, and the first to really give out that classic Halloween vibe, especially in the third act. I never thought I would find myself defending a Rob Zombie movie, since I was not a fan of his other films, but here I am. It's wicked, it's nasty, it's atmospheric, it's creepy, and it's just a wild ride. The first horror movie in a long time to really grab me and make me think about it afterward. Rob, I was all set to write some witty attacks on your film, but I won't get to use them. Instead, I say thanks, thanks for making a Halloween film that really hits you for the first time in nearly 30 years.",1189209600,3,4205,4.541501976284585
3179186,4,B000VKL6Z2,"Few directors can be trusted to make a good slasher movie these days, let alone a good remake of any kind of horror movie. Most  everybody else has moved on, lost their magic, or never had it in the first place.

This is all the more vital if one is going to tribute film patriarchs. Gus van Sant's version of *Psycho* is still contentious--an egotistical blasphemy as far as some buffs are concerned. Tom Savini's brilliant remake of *Night of the Living Dead* seems largely ignored to me, while Zack Snyder's *Dawn of the Dead* is really a dumb Americanization of *28 Days Later*. Important considerations if one presumes to remake that daddy of slasher films, *Halloween*.

Independent film master John Carpenter gave us the original, based on a screenplay co-written with Debra Hill. Dimension Films acquired the rights and after a string of terrible sequels, began looking to reboot the series. Along comes Rob Zombie.

Up front, forget this noise about ""re-envisioning,"" or ""making it your own"", or ""a film for a new generation"". I only care about good movies. Movies with smarts and maturity, from plot to acting to editing. Movies that love themselves and love their audiences too. Like Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth, Rob Zombie combines a respect for his roots with the skill and vision to apply them. With a couple exceptions, *Halloween* is such a slasher movie.

Mainly because Zombie chucks out the supernatural canards in favor of a true crime sensibility. Nuts to that stuff about the curse of Samhain. The real horror comes from a dirt head little boy in a Kiss t-shirt, who takes enough abuse with too little love to become a psychopath. The first half of the movie charts Michael Meyer's transition into murder, complete with screaming parents, indifferent siblings, and schoolyard bullies. By the time school authorities discover evidence of the boy's madness, things become famously, dramatically too late.

Plenty of horror movies have a vignette or a toss-away speech to explain their villains. Rob Zombie spends two whole acts to show how Meyers is shaped by his environment to become The Shape. Along these lines he develops actual relationships between the killer and other people, most notably that of his mother, a janitor, and Dr. Sam Loomis. The mother and doctor in particular play much longer and deeper roles than in the original film, contributing greatly to my interest. But even the sister and father get more screen time and development in terms of Michael's growing addiction to death.

That Zombie fills in gaps is another mark of the film's quality. We see when Michael finally crosses the line from a troubled boy to a speechless murder machine. How he escapes imprisonment. How Meyers acquires his mask and coveralls. How he knows to stalk the virgin babysitter Laurie and her not-so-virgin friends.

And stalk he does. For Zombie's vision is dark, literally as well as figuratively. A selective use of slow motion, sound effects, and low-end rhythms in the soundtrack evoke night-time terrors even during the day. It makes heavy use of source lighting to create thick shadows. For that matter, a lot of the sound is source-based too, and Zombie sometimes uses deep throated sirens or high pitched baby screams as a substitute for ambient music. The film itself is saturated to emphasize dark colors, and even broad daylight looks as if shot through a grimy window.

The blood is dark red to black, which probably helped this movie get an ""R"" instead of an ""NC-17"". It also helps that, as usual for horror movies, most of The Shape's victims are unsympathetic--it's always okay to kill cops, abusive dads, truckers, and sluts in the movies.  And as usual, we don't see the death of animals or little kids. We even get the old clich&eacute;' of a loathsome punk being killed, to foreshadow another character's prowess. I don't knock the movie much for this, though, because *Halloween* comes from that sort of tradition. The most ""innocent"" victims are still portrayed as schmucks, and indeed one of the recurrent themes in Rob Zombie movies is that the public is too naive and ill-equipped to deal with psychos.

Speaking of violence and themes, Zombie eschews the current trend in dismemberments and arterial sprays. He also avoids the 1980's trend of lingering on the murder weapon as if it were a phallus. Instead, Mike Meyers lands fierce, rapid blows; he does not stab so much as bludgeon. And while he does not torture his victims, they die more painfully and terror-stricken than in *Hostel*. Because where Zombie does linger is the moment of expiration, and so *Halloween* is a death fan's delight. People gurgle and twitch in bathtub-sized pools of blood, as their killer looks them in their bulging eyes... Typically, the majority of time the camera skips over a death scene is when the victim is an animal.

Indeed, the one sin of this film is not brutality, but boredom. The Shape kills about 21 characters, most of them extras or cameos, and I began to tire around 17. By the time Meyers stalks the babysitters, the murders play more like the original: faster, less bloody, but more cinematic. Yet it was too late; the pursuit of the Laurie character dragged further, with multiple escapes and captures and false deaths. I never got the sense that Zombie was aware of how much the story dragged in the last half-hour. He only changed his portrayal of murder when he wanted to bring his vision closer to that of Carpenter, or to avoid upsetting PETA.

Zombie's own sin then, is that he doesn't give his audience enough credit. Believe me, Rob: I study violence and psychopathy; I spent eight years in the military, I know plenty of violence victims, and I am a witness to violence myself. So I got the point before I even stepped into the theater. I wanted to be entertained, and that doesn't happen when I start to yawn. I have three murder scenes in mind that could be altered to a non-fatal attack, or cut altogether, and the climatic chase can also stand to shave about two minutes.

So yeah, I liked the first half of the movie, which consisted mainly of original material and real shocks, than the more derivative second. That's not the final word on this movie. It's a damn sight better than most, let alone all horror remakes I've seen. Most of the latter suck because they are made by commercial and music video directors who have no competency or love for the source material.  It's further obvious that Hollywood has become too cheap and risk-adverse to make original films. I tend stay away from the theater as a result.

Rob Zombie, himself a music video director, is that rare fellow who can make water better than most people can make a movie. That's a strong statement from a guy who doesn't believe in brownnosing, and I solicit it freely because it's the truth. If you want to see a good movie in general, not just a good slasher, see Zombie's remake of *Halloween*.",1188864000,,6937,4.807046979865772
3179187,4,B000VKL6Z2,Well I will say that I had heard mixed reviews going into this movie some saying that it was awful and some people it was great. I thought that it was a very solid effort by Rob Zombie considering some of his other movies I had not been to found of. I got to see the first Halloween first before the new one so that was cool. The one thing that I really liked about the new movie is it took time to give you the story we he wants to live behind the mask. You got to see what it was like in his family and how kids treated him and there were some pretty cool killings. Another thing that I liked about the new Halloween is this was non stop action. I have watched all the Halloweens and they seemed to move slower which is not a bad thing but I would say it was a nice change to see non stop action. I did not know when it was going to end but the ending is for you to judge I did not like it that much and I will say that is the only flaw in this movie but a really solid effort and better than the recent Halloween movies. I think that you should pick this up on DVD when it comes out or at least rent it. It is for you to judge but I liked it so give it a shot.,1188777600,2,1163,3.693548387096774
3179188,4,B000VKL6Z2,This was by far one of the greatest remakes Ive seen. The prequel leading up to the remake was sweet! Rob Zombie really exceded my expetations with this movie . No remake is going to be good as the original so all those idiots need to shut it whining that didn't like it. As a Halloween movie it was by far the best since Pt. 4 or 5 . Really sweet movie GO SEE IT OVER AND OVER!,1188777600,3,378,3.858974358974359
3179189,3,B000VKL6Z2,"I really enjoyed the original movie, and thought the remake looked really interesting.  I knew it would take on a different twist, especially since I looked at the spoilers on Wikipedia.  However, I didn't realize it would show the murders.  I left the movie after the first act finished, as I was numbed and tired from seeing the beatings/murders in their entirety.  The original was better in that the scenes cut away during the beatings.  The viewer still knew the victims were being murdered; watching the scenes in the remake was so unnecessary.  The music was sensational and I loved the inclusion of the original Halloween theme.  The backstory was clever (I differ from the reviewers who said the remake gave too much away).  Still, I was very disappointed with all the gore shown.  I long for the movies where the story was more about creepy than blood and gore.  I think I'll go rent the original at Blockbuster now.",1188777600,2,926,4.73125
3179190,5,B000VKL6Z2,"""Halloween"" is great! The directing by Rob Zombie (who also directed ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" (2003) & ""The Devil's Rejects"" (2005) is great.

The cast led by Malcolm McDowell (as Dr. Samuel Loomis) & Sheryl Moon Zombie (as Deborah Myers) (who also is Zombie's wife and has starred in Zombie's ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" & ""The Devil's Rejects""), is great. The screenplay by Zombie (based on John Carpenter's and Debra Hill's screenplay) (who also wrote the screenplay to ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" & ""The Devil's Rejects"") is great. The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to ""300"" (2007), ""Slither"" (2006), ""The Devil's Rejects"", & ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (2004) is excellent.

3179192,1,B000VKL6Z2,"As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.

The problem with this ""Halloween"" is:

1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from ""Devil's Rejects"" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.

2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.

 In the original, the grown up Michael was known as ""The Shape"", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.

3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to ""God Of Thunder"", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.

4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! ""Rest in Peace""? You bet.

5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, ""What do I do now?""

6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is ""Halloween"" not ""High School Musical"".

7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E's ""Cold Case File"" or ""American Justice"". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.

8. The ending. Absolute bull***t.

Stick with Carpenter's eternal classic, because next Halloween this remake will be forgotten, like last years autumn leaves.",1188691200,12,2670,4.482474226804124
