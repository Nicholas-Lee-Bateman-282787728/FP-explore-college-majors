148407,4,0792840984,"Glenn Ford plays the son of a former gunfighter ,haunted by his father's reputation and his own inability to come to terms with it .He is himself an expert with a gun and fast on the draw but is trying to live anonymously as a storekeeper in a small frontier town. Enter Broderick Crawford as a swaggering psychopathic bully who wants to build a reputation as the Fastest Gun in the territory .This inevitably brings him into conflict with Ford and the local citizenry virtually force Ford into a gunfight as they exert presure amid accusations of cowardice. It is clear they are as blood lusting as Crawford under their veneer of respectability.

Their are thematic links with The Gunfighter and High Noon in this fascinating  western which is brilliantly acted by its leads and a bevy of strong supporting players ,who include John Dehner ,Leif Ericson and Noah Beery Junior
Expertly shot in black and white  this is a curio not a classic but it is compelling ,literate and engrossing",1202688000,7,986,4.754385964912281
148408,5,0792840984,"Glenn Ford played everything from a school teacher, a preacher, to an Aircraft carrier commander. But the western is where he made his name as far a public popularity! ""The Fastest Gun Alive"" rates up there with ""Heaven With A Gun"" and ""The Last Challenge."" All three of these Glenn Ford westerns are definitely worth the time, but this is not only  my favorite of the three, it's my all time favorite of Glenn's classic work. The story grabs your attention from the very outset and just gets better as it moves to the end, which has a neat twist to it!
If you're a western fan, you won't be disappointed with this one!",1188432000,8,619,4.4298245614035086
148409,5,0792840984,"I usually don't like westerns, but this one really caught my attention. It doesn't thrive on a lot of difficult sets and action. It's definately a thinker's western. Here you have a fighter who doesn't want to fight, a town with a secret and promise that they'll have a hard time to keep from breaking to save itself. Very suspenseful and very well done.",1136937600,6,354,4.546875
148410,5,0792840984,"Glenn Ford was one of our alltime great Western movie actors. In his heyday, he was great at combining fragile humanity with raw strength and brute force.

In The Fastest Gun Alive, Ford plays a reformed gunfighter who is desperately trying to live down his reputation in a small town, living a very quiet, peaceful existence. But events unfold that reveal his identity, and soon Broderick Crawford, a fast-draw outlaw, coems to town to match skills with Ford.

Everyone is excellent in this film, but great movies like this are made with a great script and a great perfomance by the lead, and Ford is at the top of his game.",1107993600,21,625,4.621621621621622
148411,4,0792840984,"The image of the western gunfighter has been indelibly etched by the likes of John Wayne in the forties and Clint Eastwood in the sixties as a supremely confident and capable shootist. It is rare for Hollywood to buck this trend but in THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE director Robert Rouse peels away the layers that all too often separate celluloid fiction from brute fact.  Glen Ford is George Temple, a one time fast draw expert who has spent years trying to live down a wall of self-imposed isolation that he feels would be needed each time another quick draw wannabe wants to put him to the test.  He has learned to camouflage his unwanted skill over the years.  He has married an understanding woman (Jeanne Crain), who suffers in silence along with him each time he has to struggle to contain the itch to show off a talent that she knows will eventually kill him.  The first half of this superb film is a study in how one man chooses to live a life to which he is clearly unsuited.  He runs a small store in a small town surrounded by folk who have no idea who or what he is.  The focus is on character development, no small feat in the gunfighter genre.  In the next town, a bank robbery led by Broderick Crawford yanks Temple out of his comfortable pseudo-existence.  Crawford hears of Temple's speedy draw and pauses in his escape from a posse to challenge Temple in a showdown.  It is almost beside the point that any desperado would chance getting caught by the law merely to add a notch to his gun.  From the first reel to the last, both Temple and the bank robber are on tracks that do not permit any deviation.  In an odd sort of way, both men share more than speed with a pistol.  Each is driven by the gun: Crawford, to venerate it, and Temple to negate it.  The climactic showdown is the cracklingly effective sort of western legend that has been all too often obscured by the fake glories of the movie cowboy.  Glen Ford is a movie cowboy here too, but he makes you think that just maybe this is the way that shootouts at high noon must have been like.  This gem is rarely seen except on cable.  Catch it and see how a small part of the west was won.",1069200000,46,2159,4.306930693069307
148412,4,0792840984,"To his friends and neighbors George Temple (Glenn Ford) is a mild-mannered store keeper who doesn't wear a gun. But, unknown to all but his wife (Jeanne Crain), George is obsessed with guns because in his youth he lacked the courage to go up against his lawman father's killer. Through years of secret practice George has become the fastest draw in the west, but he is still afraid of drawing against a man. When a ruthless gunman (Broderick Crawford) comes to town and threatens to burn it down Temple is forced to overcome his fears and try to stop him. This finely-crafted western deserves more recognition than it has received. If you like westerns, please try to catch this one.",971308800,30,683,4.7
148413,5,0792840984,"i remember my dad taking me to see this movie when i was just a kid.  i wasn't a big glen ford fan, but my dad was.  but, we both loved westerns so in we went. we got our popcorn and cola's and made our seats just as the  movie began to roll.  it started of slow and i was afraid it was going to  continue along at that pace. it picked up when ford started talking to his  wife 'mary' and how much he hated working their little store.  mary went on  abount all the trouble in dodge and abillene,and ford said nothing.  as  customers came in the talked down to him. they didn't seem to have a  special reason they just did.  the next morning we see ford taking the  wagon out to the flat when he comes upon a young boy from town,  gord tells  him to hop up, he has some things to do and proceeds to mosey down the road  until he finally gets out and takes a pair of guns from beneath the seat of  the wagon.  the shooting you see could never be done of course but the  photography is quite excellant and glen blasts apart everything in sight  and drawing faster that any combinations of western heroes that ever lived.  ford takes the boy back to town and gets his promise that he will remain  silent.  as glen walks down to the saloon everybody is bragging about the  fast gun (broderick crawford) and all the tinings he can do with is  firearms.  glen finally looks over at won the to\he townspeople and ask why  he is wearing his gun strapped to his leg and why he shouldn't do it.  they  laught.  then tey taunt him. what do you know? and begin to laugh.  enraged, ford goes back to his store and over his wifes protests straps on  his irons. ford storms back to the salloon and invites everybod outside.  they go to humour him.  ford asks someone to throw a handful of coins of  into the air looks up, pulls an impossibly incredible fast draw and blows  everything out of the sky.  he then tells one of his once a upon a time  heckler to pour a glass of whiskey and stand across from him.  when the man  hesitates, ford says - just do it.  this is not the same mild storekeeper  anymore and the man does it.  ford says quite simply 'drop it' and no  sooned do his fingers open than the glass is blown to kingdom come. there  is the expected showdown with broderick crawfor that i hope you get to see  for yourself.  this really is an exceptionsl movie.

148439,4,0792840984,"Glenn handled most of his films with the same nervy, but, stoic acting style. In this film, he's a storekeeper who's trying to live a quiet life to appease his wife Jeanne Crain. They've moved around a bit to achieve this peace, bur, Glenn has a secret. I'm not going to give away the plot for those who haven't seen the movie, but overall, the movie is a winner.

The only negative I had was Humphrey Bogart in his role as Vinnie, the bank robber & fast gun who wants the title ""The fastest gun alive"". He's too old for the role (which gives a bit of a laugh when someone addresses him as ""young man"") & his loud, aggressive handling of his role can be a bit over-the-top at times.

148524,1,0792840984,"Again, Hollywood tries to make something dramatic while showing average people as complete idiots with absolutely ridiculous scenarios. What really surprised me was the level of Hollywood PC coming out way back in the 50's! If you're a gun hating leftist, this movie is for you! So here we have a guy who's an expert gunslinger back on Wild West 1889. Now I cannot in the real world imagine someone really good at something and ""haunted"" by it, especially when it involves handling one of the most basic and necessary tools of the day. Yes, an expert gunslinger in the old west that doesn't like guns! So after a bank robbery we have the bad guys roll into some podunk town during church services. They're in a hurry because they know the posse is about 2 hours behind them, but they have time to stop into the bar for one. Surprisingly, the ENTIRE town is at church - save for one 8 year old boy, who just happens to be hanging out in the bar? I mean, in the real world, WHY would that kid be the ONE person not in church if the entire rest of the town is? Why would the kid be in the BAR? And it gets more ridiculous. In yesterday's little demonstration in town the awesome gunslinger shot 2 silver dollars out of the air, amazing everyone present - which happens to be 3/4 of the town. HOW is it that this kid has both of them?? On the real world, I'd think the bar owner that supplied them would have at least one of them, for the kid to be pocketing both of them is ridiculous. Meanwhile, back in church, it just so happens that our hero has decided to leave town because he's afraid of other gunslingers finding out about him and coming after him. You know, I'd call that a bit ridiculous but I could almost see a SMALL point to that, just to be overly fair. So we have a big ""meeting"" during this church service where the people talk him into not leaving and swearing they will never, ever mention a word to anyone, the rest of their lives, relevant to what they witnessed the day before to this guys' skills. Rather ridiculous. But the part that throws me is, here's where the PC comes in. Imagine people back in old west 1889 talking about how much they ""hate guns""! Yes, that was a good part of the discussion in the church, how many of these - MEN even, not just women, mind you - ""hated"" guns! This is the old west in 1889 people!! Well, we're not done getting really ridiculous yet. So our bad guys are in the bar, boss bad guy thinks he's the fastest gun in the land and see's the 2 silver dollars that this kid unbelievably happens to have while he's the only one in town not in church and happens to be playing in the bar! Boss man is pissed, suddenly the posse, only about 1 1/2 hours behind them, isn't important any more. No, he HAS to put everything else aside until he can have a shootout with some stranger. Does that sound realistic to you? Oh yeah, I find that believable...yeah, sure! He sends one of his cronies into the church to deliver the message that Mr. Fast Gun has to come out and have a shootout. To further persuade him, he has the other crony find cans of kerosene and start dumping it all over the towns' buildings, threatening to burn down the town in 5 minutes if the guy doesn't come out. As if this isn't stupid enough - all over hearing that someone is a fast draw - the part that really cracks me up is when all the townspeople stand there in the church vestibule watching...and do nothing??! They give up! An entire town is going to stand there and let one person burn down the entire town? Really? And they have no clue what to do about it? The crony just walks down the middle of town pouring fuel on all the buildings, later wields a torch, no one is going to try to stop him? By the way, they have the gun right there in the church - Mr Fast Gun brought it there asking the pastor to get rid of it, you know, guns are BAAAD you know! Even in 1889!

The stupidity continues but I've already spent more time on this than it's worth. This is just more of Hollywood trying to make drama out of people acting like complete idiots, ridiculous stupidity that would never, ever, happen in real life and loaded with political correctness. 50's version of leftist PC and stupidity! This is one of those movies where the ridiculousness drives you so crazy it's pretty much impossible to watch. It ended - none too soon - and all I could do was shake my head...there's a couple hours I'll never get back!",1426982400,,4441,4.274346793349169

Warner Brothers, MGM and Universal are all using these cheap cases to sell you their archived classics.

When you open the case you're immediately hit by a strong, sweet, pungent and (more than likely) brain damaging odor. Then, after you set the movie aside for a week or more, the case begins to warp and expand opening up and releasing that brain-cell killing odor into your home. Luckily, I had some extra old empty DVD cases lying around so I was able to replace it.

148594,4,0792840984,"Work with me here: I was watching HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE with my niece and when that was over, I started watching THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE. My niece complained that she wanted to watch something like HANNAH MONTANA. I told her then that these two movies actually had something in common. She settled down, unconvinced, and five minutes later she was on the Wii. So that's her out of the picture.

If you're looking to put Glenn Ford in a cubbyhole, it's probably that one over there labeled ""thinking man's hero."" Glenn Ford always did exude this aura of quiet competence and internalized emotions. THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE, released in 1956, fit him perfect. He specialized in the contemplative western. This one's based on Frank D. Gilroy's story ""The Last Notch.""

In 1889, in the tiny town of Cross Creek, no one was more peaceful or mild-mannered than local storekeeper George Temple (Ford). He comes off as so meek that his neighbors tend to dismiss him, especially Harvey Maxwell (Allyn Joslyn) who fancies himself quite the gunman. But George Temple has a festering secret. There's a reason he and his wife Dora (Jeanne Crain) had relocated from Dodge City and from Cheyenne.

Four years the Temples had lived uneventfully in Cross Creek. So far George has held it together. But one instance of too many slugs of whiskey, and false courage kicks in and there's nothing for it but for George to show off. Two ventilated silver dollars later and a shot-up glass later, and George is being hailed as the fastest gun alive. This is what George's pregnant wife had been fearing. Someone says to someone else in the film: ""No matter how fast you are, there's always somebody faster.""

Cross Creek is so small it doesn't have a sheriff. That gang of outlaws, fleeing a vengeful posse, knows this. Led by Vinnie Harold (Broderick Crawford), a notorious quick draw, the gang makes a beeline for Cross Creek. There, Vinnie learns that there's someone touted as faster than he is. This won't do for Vinnie. He's rarin' to slap leather against Cross Creek's vaunted gunman. Except George Temple wants no part of this.

THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE, modest and low-budgeted and in black and white, was an unexpected hit. I guess folks were caught unawares of the thoughtful narrative and the absorbing character study. Glenn Ford is fabulous and complex and tortured. He's juxtaposed by Broderick Crawford whose character also demonstrates unexpected layers. There's also a last moment meditation on man's hypocrisy, and this is the bit where I draw a parallel between a similar plot conceit from this movie and from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-Montana-The-Movie/dp/B002BIULQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah Montana: The Movie</a>. The Spoiler Police prevents me from going into detail, other than to say it has something to do with a solemn oath made by both Hannah's and George Temple's hometowns.

If that doesn't whet your viewing appetite, then what about Russ Tamblyn's spectacular spade dance? It fits right into this movie, just like the Hannah Montana reference.",1373846400,,3112,5.140316205533597

Directed by Russell Rouse

Whenever it becomes known how good he is with a gun, ex-gunfighter George Temple (Glenn Ford) and his wife Dora (Jeanne Crain) have to flee the town, in fear of all the gunmen who might want to challenge him. Now resettled in another town as a mild-mannered storekeeper, George unfortunately again spills his secret (and demonstrates his considerable skills) after a bout of drinking. All the citizens of the town swear to keep his secret and support him to give up his guns forever - but a boy tells the story to a gang of wanted criminals, led by renown fast-gun Vinnie Harold (Broderick Crawford). Vinnie threatens to burn down the whole town, if George doesn't meet with him to settle who really is The Fastest Gun Alive!

Classic western action with an outstanding cast.

148645,4,0792840984,"I remember my father taking me to the theater when I was a youngster. It was the old-fashion type theater with wide aisles, spacious seating, gentle slopping, the smell of popcorn wafting across the room, and the theater only seating one audience (you know--the time before greed became fashionable). Okay, back to the film.

I also remember my father comparing this movie to High Noon. I would agree with my dad that the stories are similar. Both Will Kane (Gary Cooper) and George Kelby Jr. (Glenn Ford) battle with fear and conscience--Will's fear is cowardice; George's fear is ego (i.e. having to prove he's the best). In the end, both are successful in facing their nemesis.

I deduct one star for the flat-footed betrayal of (over-weight) badman, Vinnie Harold (Broderick Crawford), whose prime mission in life is to prove he's the fastest gun--and this becomes his undoing. Watching Mr. Crawford's acting reminded me too much of a Highway Patrol episode. Otherwise, an enjoyable--and not oft seen western.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fastest-Gun-Alive/dp/B003552QU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fastest Gun Alive</a>",1315008000,4,1169,5.790697674418604

148647,3,0792840984,"""The Fastest Gun Alive"" is another mid 50s black and white western from MGM. It concerns the attempt of a famous gunslinger to escape his past. The film was based on a 60 minute teleplay named ""The Last Notch"" that starred Jeff Morrow and Richard Jaeckel.

Quiet and handsome Glenn Ford (1916-2006) appeared in more than 100 films from 1937 to 1991. He was nominated for a Golden Globe 3 times and won once (""Pocketful of Miracles"" in 1961). Ford could do light comedy (e.g., ""Teahouse of the August Moon"", ""Courtship of Eddie's Father"", ""Don't Go Near the Water"") as well as drama (e.g., ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""3:10 to Yuma""). He enjoyed playing the everyman and said that ""it gives the audience someone real to identify with. I never play anyone but myself on screen."" Ford plays a retired gunfighter.

Pretty and perky Jeanne Crain (1925-2003) was nominated for an Oscar for ""Pinky"" (1949) and was popular in the 40s and 50s and then transitioned to TV in the 60s. Crain plays Ford's wife.

Broderick Crawford (1911-86) was a great actor with a distinct look and sound. I remember him best from his TV days on ""Highway Patrol"" but he's most well known for winning the Oscar for ""All the King's Men"" (1949). His gruff manner and quick speech suited him for many roles. He plays a gunfighter looking for a reputation.

Noah Beery Jr. (1913-94) was the son of silent film star Noah Beery and nephew of 30s mega star Wallace Beery. He made more than 100 films but is probably best remembered for his roles on TV as James Garner's father in ""Rockford Files"" (1974-80) and Uncle Joey in ""Circus Boy"" (1956-7). Beery plays a bank robber and associate of Crawford.

John Dehner (1915-92) plays another gang member. Dehner's distinctive baritone voice and chiseled features graced more than 200 films and TV shows. Indeed he was so prolific that one year (1956) he appeared in 7 films and another year (1959) he was on 9 different TV programs.

This film has a whole slew of popular cowboy character actors, including Leif Erickson, John Douchette (blacksmith), Rhys Williams (bartender),.John Dierkes, J. M. Kerrigan, Walter Baldwin, Allyn Joslyn, and Louis Jean Heydt. Russ Tamblyn has a small part and does a dance number which surely earned him a later role in ""West Side Story"" (1961).

Director and writer Russell Rouse (1913-87) is best known for his Oscar winning ""Pillow Talk"" (1959) and his Oscar nominated ""The Well"" (1951). Among his other films are ""DOA"" (1988), ""The Oscar"" (1966), and ""New York Confidential"". With co-writer Clarence Green he specialized in film noir (""DOA"", ""The Thief"", ""Wicked Woman""). Rouse uses a style that is more reminiscent of TV rather than film, especially with his camerawork and music.

Andre Pevin (1929) did the score. Previn scored 46 films and was nominated for an Oscar 12 times, winning 4 times (""My Fair Lady"", ""Irma La Douce"", ""Porgy and Bess"", and ""Gigi"").

George Folsey (1898-1988) photographed more than 150 films and was nominated for an Oscar 11 times. His films include ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956), ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" (1954), and ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" (1944).

The ""gunfighter settles down"" type of western includes films like ""The Gunfighter"" (1950) with Gregory Peck, ""Man of the West"" (1958) with Gary Cooper, ""Ride a Crooked Trail"" (1958) with Audie Murphy, ""The Law and Jake Wade"" (1958) with Robert Taylor, and ""Shane"" (1953) with Allan Ladd. Usually in this genre subtype, the hero is trying to hide his past and gets sucked back by circumstances. In this film, however, it is Ford who reveals his past, more from pride than circumstance.

The film comes at a time when the ""psychological western"" was in vogue, partly due to the work of Anthony Mann and Jimmy Stewart at the start of the decade. John Wayne's character in ""The Searchers"" released also in 1956 is a film in which Wayne's internal dialogue is more prominent than in any other western.

In 1956 viewers were lured by the blockbusters - ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Around the World in 80 days"", ""War and Peace"", and ""The King and I"" were the box office favorites. The Oscars went to ""Giant"" (Director), ""Anastasia"" (Actress), and ""Lust for Life"" (Supporting Actor). Other notable films that year included ""The Searchers"", ""Baby Doll"", ""The Rainmaker"", and ""Bus Stop"". It was a good year for westerns with one of the best films ever, ""The Searchers"", plus of a host of B westerns including Dana Andrews in ""Comanche"", James Arness in ""Gun the Man Down"", Kirk Douglas in ""The Indian Fighter"", Frank Sinatra in ""Johnny Concho"", Richard Widmark in ""The Last Wagon"", and Robert Ryan in ""The Proud Ones"".

The NY Times said called the film ""an engrossing and, on occasion, a comic and tricky adventure"" and said Ford's performance was ""sensitive and forceful"". He praised Dehner for ""a professionally smooth and funny job"" and said ""Crain adds a tender and compassionate stint.""

This is an average B western from the 50s. Glenn Ford was always good in a western, and the supporting cast all do a good job. Broderick Crawford is slightly out of water here, but not to the point of annoyance.",1305763200,,5120,4.849942726231386

I read all 25 of the reviews before I made the purchase, and since not one of the reviews mentioned having any trouble playing the movie, I thought I would take a chance.  The movie would not play on my DVD player, or on any of the three other DVD players I tried.  I was unaware at the time that there are two competing formats for recordable DVDs (DVD-R and DVD+R).  Some DVD players are capable of playing both formats, but I seriously doubt that the four DVD players I tried are the only models made without this ability, so beware.  I hope in the future that Amazon.com will add a warning advising people to consult with their owners manual before ordering any movie recorded in DVD-R to ensure that their DVD player supports the format.

Update.  I bought a new Sony DVD player from Amazon that playes DVD-R movies, and the DVD still would not play.  It is obvoius now that I was sold a defective DVD.  As I stated above this was the first movie I ever ordered manufactured on a recordable DVD using the DVD-R format.  I tried to save money by ordering it from one of the distributors (MovieMars) in the list for new DVDs sold through Amazon.  When I sent an e-mail to MovieMars explaining the problem I was having they sent one e-mail wanting me to restate the problem, and then I never heard from them again.  I have increasingly noticed that when I search Amazon's website for older movies that many of them are now ""manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media"".  In the future I will only buy a DVD recorded in this manor (DVD-R) from Amazon, for I fully trust Amazon's return policy.

148664,4,0792840984,"This one of my favorite movies all though it is hard to find. I would love to have this movie especially in a colorized version and wide screen. Glen Ford plays the part of a store keeper who puts away his gun for a new begining with his wife. As the story plays out a mean low down killer wanting to make a name played by Brodrick Crawford. The towns people get to talking about how he killed a gun fighter. Some of the men keep going over the story and frustrating Glenn Ford. He then gets agitated and wants people to know he was good and fast with the gun. He does not say to the towns people he has not killed anyone with a gun. Glenn
Ford was known as the fastest draw with a gun in hollywood westerns.",1267660800,3,708,4.028368794326241
148665,5,0792840984,"i  first saw this little B western a number of years ago and many westerns later, i still consider this little gem an absolute masterpiece. it is my favorite western of all time. this one excels in ways no other western film could. it deals with a seemingly modest and reserved shopkeeper whom we soon learn is dealing with a serious mental dilemma manifested in his psyche through guilt. to disclose anymore details would be unjust to anyone who hasn't had the awesome pleasure of witnessing this little gem.

as for the DVD. for latest format (DVD-R) and distribution: Warner Archives, the transfer is quite good and the sound is also very audible and clear. i personally had some problem getting it to play in my player but i think it must have been a slight compatibility problem as all players have some quirks.",1264204800,2,816,4.659722222222222
148666,5,0792840984,"Tough Broderick Crawford is compelled to be the fastest gun alive.  He insists on doing battle with Glen Ford, who may actually be faster, but who has never faced another man in a gunfight. The outcome is interesting.  Crawford sounds as much like a westerner as Rocky Balboa.  But his character is ice cold and awful.  Crawford pulls it off with skill.  Ford's western dialect is right out of Ohio, but his acting is almost painful to watch.  Despite some hitches in the movie(not the kind horses are tied to), I enjoy watching it for the suspense, and for the ultimate moment - the gunfight itself.",1260403200,3,600,4.613207547169812
148667,5,0792840984,"This movie surprised me, having not heard very much about it before watching it over the weekend.

I really liked the lean, spare directing and acting -- the storyline is so linear, the narrative so driven, that you become immediately drawn into the almost fatalistic way the story unspools.

Ford is unusually good; you can see the tensions boiling up inside him as he hears the townspeople make fun of and belittle his ""gentle shopkeeper.""  Ford's confrontation with them in the bar, where he carefully undresses them one by one, is masterful.

The climax is like a train approaching in the distance -- you know it's coming, it's been coming down the tracks the whole time, yet there is nothing you can do about it.

An overlooked classic.",1254700800,2,741,4.7578125
148668,5,0792840984,"This film deals with the codes that nourished a legend. A mild mannered storekeeping (Glenn Ford), regarded as the fastest gun alive ever is progressively challenged by several circumstances to demonstrate it while a bad man (Broderick Crawford) who also is an expert shooter refuses to be ranked as the second best. And so this match will be the central nervous of the film.

The final gunfight between them is still worthy to see it. A minor classic.",1249430400,,452,4.794871794871795
148669,1,0792840984,"I can't believe anyone would rate this movie worth five seconds of their time!!!! Broderick Crawford as a fast gun!!!? Good god, I never saw an actor so out of place in any movie. And that name, VINNIE HAROLD!!! Who the heck thought that one up!? My kids and I laugh our heads off every time this movie comes on TV. To us, it's as ridiculous as ""Blazing Saddles"", and might be funnier. As for Glen Ford, an actor I usually like, his performance couldn't be much more overwrought if he tried. I love westerns in general, but this is a real stretch. Horrible movie.",1235952000,2,563,4.371428571428571
148670,4,0792840984,"In a Western, the ultimate confrontation between the forces of good and evil is the showdown... It is the classic ending, and as such, the point towards which the whole film has been moving; the moment of truth when the good guy faces the black guy in the dust of the main street... It is, of course, a cinema clich...Tension mounts as the two protagonists walk slowly towards their duel, a clash that is inevitable and from which only one will walk away...

In ""The Fastest Gun Alive,"" an aggressive, belligerent bandit Vinnie Harold (Broderick Crawford) refuses to be taking as ""second best,"" and a peaceful shopkeeper (Glenn Ford) claims to be 'faster than Wyatt Earp, faster than Billy the Kid, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.'

That's the clich, and it comes in with such high expectation as director Russel Rouse builds the climax with great degree of intensity, and higher degree of excitement... A few words are exchanged, when a loud voice is heard from a stocky figure: 'You the one who shot the silver dollars?' 'Yes,' replies a fairly silent man. 'By what name are you called,'? asks a determined killer. 'Kelby. George Kelby.' And suddenly the two men draw... Both fired simultaneously at the same instant...

The clash is a heightened moment of suspense that is as exciting as anything the cinema has ever produced...

Based upon a story called ""The Last Notch"" by Frank D. Gilroy, this minor budget Western turned out to be a surprise smash... Russ Tamblyn delivers a great ""solo"" dancing number just to reduce the tension...",1233446400,,1568,4.796296296296297
148671,4,0792840984,"Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr. (Glenn Ford) and his wife Dora (Jeanne Crain) settle down in a peaceful little town under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the ""fastest gun alive"". George becomes a mild-mannered tea-totaling shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk.

One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold (Broderick Crawford) has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the fastest gun in the west. George's pride is stung. Eventually, he becomes so frustrated, he gets drunk and blurts out his secret. When the citizens disbelieve him, he gives them a demonstration of his skill.

Harold finds out and, backed up by fellow bank robbers Taylor Swope (John Dehner) and Dink Wells (Noah Beery, Jr.), threatens to burn down the whole town unless George faces him. With no other choice, George outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople claim that the two men shot each other dead, allowing George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence.

Russ Tamblyn, who later co-starred in West Side Story (1961), performs a dance routine during a hoe-down early in the film that includes a remarkable ""shovel"" dance, i.e. dancing on shovels used as stilts",1228348800,3,1292,5.113744075829384

7792267,5,0792840984,"Broderick Crawford plays a gunman, killer, and robber who, because of something that happened to him, needs everyone to know who he is and that he is the fastest gun alive. He comes to the town where Glenn Ford is living with his pregnant wife. Ford is extremely fast with a gun, but he did not avenge his father's murder and this drove him to drink and to show he is fast with a gun. We do not know at the beginning of the film why he did not avenge his dad.
He keeps promising his wife that he will stop drinking and not show how fast he is with a gun. He tries several times in several cities, but always fails. He does so again in this town where up to now he has been sober for four years. Now his wife tells him that they must separate. He goes to a church and stands before the entire congregation. He gives his gun to the pastor and swears he will never use it again. He says he is leaving town because he showed the town yesterday that he was fast with a gun. Word will get around and people will come to the town to prove they are faster. The town people like him, and beg him to stay. They swear they will never reveal what happened yesterday and never reveal that he is fast with a gun. However, one boy was not in the church, and when Crawford came, he told him that there was a man in town who was faster with a gun than anybody.
The acting in the film is very good, and as we watch we wonder why Crawford feels he must show off and why Ford drinks.",1506816000,,1463,3.979591836734694
