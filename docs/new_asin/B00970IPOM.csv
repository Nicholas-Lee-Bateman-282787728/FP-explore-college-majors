8537142,1,B00970IPOM,"Lousy, lousy, lousy. This movie has nothing going for it, on any level. I'm sorry, I've got to throw ""LOUSY"" in one last time-",1405123200,2,126,4.291666666666667
8537143,1,B00970IPOM,"Becca (Eleanor James) sells lingerie and sex toys (does it come in black?) on line. She has an on line blog where she gets close to her customers. Her close circle of friends are being killed off one by one. That's pretty much it. Not much character development. Not much plot. No suspects. No humor to add to what little horror the film generates. Bad bruise make-up on the blond. The back slasher pun doesn't even work well.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Eleanor James, Ree Sinclair)",1395360000,2,477,4.6117647058823525
8537144,2,B00970IPOM,It was a decent horror flick. This was not a great movie though. Very low budget and not one of those low budgets.,1388188800,,114,4.0
8537145,4,B00970IPOM,"What can I say... I'm a HUGE fan of her... work... Really, she's a very good actress and very easy on the eyes. The story kind of reminds me of Franco a little... A lot of thought went into the script, or a lot of drugs. I haven't quite figured that one out yet... I LOVE HER! Eleanor, will you marry me?",1366416000,3,304,3.9193548387096775
