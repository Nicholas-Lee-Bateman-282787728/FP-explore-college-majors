8467112,5,B005DL6PQY,"This DVD lesson is a gem. While the DVD is entitled ""Beginners Fingerpicking Blues"", the arrangements certainly don't sound like beginner's stuff. Sokolow, who plays a spectacular New Era Senorita steel-string guitar on this DVD, presents a tasty bunch of blues classics that cover a lot of different styles (like alternating bass, monotonic bass  la Mance Lipscomb, songs that use some jazzy chords). I like especially the modern urban blues arrangement of Charles Brown's 1951 hit ""Black Night"", where he changed the line ""my brother is in Korea"" to ""my brother is in Afghanistan"", explaining there is ""never any shortage of wars to bring a tune up-to-date"".

Each song is being taught according to the same pattern: First, there is a full-fledged performance of the tune, then Sokolow goes step by step through the arrangement explaining what to look out for. Lastly, there is a split-screen version of each tune where he plays the arrangement in slow speed.

Every song has a backup part for accompanying your singing and an instrumental part where you pick out a solo. In that way, you can really show off when playing and singing these tunes to others!

There is also a tab included that meticulously transcribes the split-screen versions. Please be aware that the split-screen versions are not exactly the same as the performance versions, but rather kind of abbreviated versions. Therefore, if you are interested in a particular lick that he used in the performance version, you won't find it in the tab unless he repeated the lick in the split-screen version. This is not always the case, however, for Sokolow never plays a song the same way twice.

A last remark on Fred Sokolow's teaching style: He is a very calm person, not without humor, and highly cultivated. He follows a no-nonsense teaching approach that works very fine for me. All in all: Highly recommended.",1341360000,7,1878,4.968152866242038
