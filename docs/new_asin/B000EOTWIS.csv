2525499,5,B000EOTWIS,"Late Spring was made in 1949, shortly after the change in the Japanese Constitution allowed women the right to have a divorce, could have only been made in this small period of time.  The film is about family, marriage and happiness.  A father, played by Chishu Ryu, wants his daughter, played by Setsuko Hara, to marry.  At first it seems she refuses to marry out of fear of what might happen to him but it soon becomes clear she fears what might happen to herself.  In other words she has grown attached to her father and living with him.  To her marriage means being pushed out into a strange new home, a strange new way of life.  She like Hamlet, fears the great unknown.  The black & white movie is 108 minutes and has commentary by Richard Pena.

A second disc has Tokyo-Ga, a great 92 minutes tribute to Ozu filmed in Tokyo in 1985.  It is wonderful to watch and, like the movie, gives a snapshot of Japan as it was and not how it is now.  This set, in other words, holds two faces of Japan that once was.  There is also a nice booklet with essays and disc information.

A must for any fans of Japanese film or if you already own Early Summer.",1162684800,13,1150,4.248847926267281
2525500,4,B000EOTWIS,"The extras on this disc are fabulous. TOKYO-GA, in particular, is fantastic. It's fascinating to see what Chishu Ryu looked like in his old age, and a real eye-opener to learn that he was almost the same age as Setsuko Hara when they were making pictures together, considering he was most often playing her father. Criterion has done a wonderful job with the bonus features and package design, as per usual. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but for one issue. My biggest complaint (and unfortunately, it IS a complaint), is with the print source quality. One of the reels has a white vertical emulsion scratch running through its entirety; the one with the famous shot of Setsuko Hara riding a bicycle with a male friend, passing a Coca-Cola sign at the side of the road. Only four years after the end of WWII, the Coke sign served as a reminder to the viewer that Japan was still occupied by the Americans, but was also feeling the encroaching influence from capitalistic western culture. Perhaps it was an insurmountable feat for Criterion to have digitally restored this sequence, but I must admit having to endure watching the vertical scratch throughout that entire sequence was quite disappointing and even infuriating, considering it's one of my favourite moments in all of Ozu's films. Having said that, it's an absolute essential for any serious film enthusiast to have this in his or her dvd collection, so I guess I'll just have to grin and bear it. I'm one of those dummies who buys his favourites again and again, like Star Wars fans, so if they improve upon the transfer, I'll probably buy it again.  ;-)

Addendum, September 14, 2014: I was feeling passionate when I originally wrote this review. The white emulsion streak is minimal, upon second, third, and fourth viewing. It's fine. At the time, I was probably just sensing the fact that these artistic artifacts do not last forever. Kudos for Criterion for caring enough to release this film on dvd for a North American audience.",1159747200,30,2004,4.772334293948127
2525501,5,B000EOTWIS,"It is postwar Japan and a widowed professor wants to marry off his only daughter. The daughter, however, doesn't want to marry and wishes to live on with her father, looking after him in his declining years, believing that there's something ""indecent"" about an older man wishing to remarry. When she believes that is her father's intent, she experiences it as a betrayal of her love for him.

Ozu builds a long, fascinating domestic drama on this simple premise, exploring the emotional dynamics that it raises and the complexities of living at a time when traditional roles for women in Japan are being challenged by Western ideals that permit women greater freedom to control their own lives.

Made over 50 years ago, this film in its quiet simplicity seems remarkably fresh and undated today. The ambiguities that it raises are not neatly resolved, and the final images are haunting when reflected on afterwards. Performances are set off by Ozu's remarkable visual style, the detached camera work and thoughtful composition, and the contrast of interiors (all verticals and horizontals) and exteriors (natural forms of trees in the wind and surf flowing onto the shore). The DVD includes a scene-by-scene commentary by film critic and historian Richard Pena.",1154649600,8,1261,5.116504854368932
2525502,5,B000EOTWIS,"I discovered this film after reading Paul Schrader's book, Transcendental Style in Film. I located an old VHS copy and got totally sucked in by it. I found I loved the father and daughter by the end in a way that was more real than in nearly any other film I'd ever seen. I felt as though I'd been invited into their home and then been treated like an honored guest as a subtle and profound crisis in this family was dealt with.

I bought a Code 3 DVD version from Shochiku Home Video and continued watching it while reading Donald Richie's book on Ozu. But the subtitles seemed to be translated poorly and I could tell that a lot of the subtleties were lost. So I was very pleased when Criterion came out with this version in which much greater care was given to the translations.

In the Shochiku version there are no subtitles at all in the famous scene at the Noh play. But Criterion provides a marvelous translation that adds another layer of depth to the experience. As Noriko looks at her father beside her and then at Mrs. Miwa, whom she thinks is going to marry him, her jealousy and hurt are underscored by the performance of the play. In it a chorus of monks recites in verse a woman's feelings for her lost love. The emotions of the woman in the play, hidden behind the monk's ritualistic performance, parallel the storm of feeling raging just beneath Noriko's subdued expressions.

This is a masterful work and Criterion's translators should be applauded. Also, Richard Pea's commentary points out even more subtleties than I'd read in Richie's book. This DVD is a treasure.",1153008000,21,1587,4.56140350877193
2525503,5,B000EOTWIS,"Ozu at his best creates achingly beautiful cinematic musings on everyday life. No car chases or explosions, no murders, not a single gun is fired, not so much as a kick in the groin or even a clenched fist. His mileiu is the routine interaction among families, the ostensibly mundane issues that affect us on a daily basis, yet he presents these issues in images so meditative, so beautifully poetic, that they become timeless and profound. As I said, these qualities represent Ozu at his best. And Late Spring is one of his best films.

The story is typical Ozu, a young woman enjoys living with her father while her father very much wants her to get married and leave the house. Not that the father doesn't enjoy having her around, he simply feels that she needs to experience life away from the burden of caring for him, so he is willing to make the sacrifice. Simple enough, right? It's the way Ozu tells the story that makes it heartbreaking and meaningful. He eschews conventional approaches to filmmaking, no dissolves, he goes from scene to scene via simple cuts, he lingers on hallways and doors for seconds after characters have left the frame, or before they arrive, his establishing shots are often establishing montages, a series of shots that show streets, buildings, gardens, parkways, flowers. He retains the small details most filmmakers would leave out, the routine greetings, the ""hi, how are you doing?""s, the casual preludes to pertinent conversation that might bog down a conventional film but are perfectly at home in the low key world of Ozu. In effect, his films  move at a steady and brooding rhythm, they are like mood pieces, tone poems that never deviate from this quietude. Modern American purveyors of shrill and screechy cinema(P.T. Anderson, Paul Haggis) could take a lesson from Ozu. There isn't a single raised voice in Late Spring, yet the film is more deeply moving than a thousand Magnolias. In fact, the little surprise at the end of Late Spring is the closest Ozu has ever come to a conventional ""twist"" ending, and even that develops naturally out of the story and the characters.

There isn't much else to say about the film. The acting is superb. Special acknowledgement should go to Setsuko Hara's performance, the way her face says so much about what her character is going through, sans any dialogue. She has a sweet smile, and has always been good at playing happy-go-lucky characters, but with an anxious underside. She has never been better.

Modern audiences, especially western audiences, might have some trouble with the idea of arranged marriage as a solution to a young woman's dilemmas. Apparently, in Japan at that time, a young woman's options were very limited, either stay at home or get married(getting an apartment or having a career were not encouraged, at least that is what the film suggests). Ozu reminds me of John Ford, he looks at communal living and conservative traditions with a somewhat bittersweet eye, but ultimately respects their places in society, mourning their passing while accepting the reality of progress. Late Spring is from another place, another time, and that needs to be taken into account, because what it says about the human condition transcends any labels of old-fashionedness.

Shorter and more simple than Tokyo Story, but no less engaging. A masterpiece.",1150675200,17,3349,4.930851063829787
2525504,5,B000EOTWIS,"This sublime film juxtoposes ancient Japan (the tranquility of temples in Kamakura and Kyoto, the shadows of branches shimering in a sparce alcove, the pagentry of a Noh play) with a contemporary focus on the problems surrounding marriage and divorce in modern life.

A father (Chishu Ryu) and virginal 27-year-old daughter(Setsuko Hara) live alone together and are clearly and hopelessly dependent upon each other. The film obliquely ponders what would happen if the daughter were to marry and leave the father. The daughter resists the idea, wanting to remain with her dad. But the world around her conspires to force her to change. With pressure from her aunt, her independent and divorced friend Aya, and foremost from her father, the daughter finally makes up her mind. The movie then concludes with just a brushlike hint at what the actual consequences of that decision might be, as the father nods his head in despair.

Thus Ozu sets up his prototype family drama that he'd repeat over and over again after 1949 in other films such as Early Summer and Tokyo Story. Although Tokyo Story is Ozu's most famous masterpiece, Late Spring has a more bracing quality.

I think it's because, in Late Spring, Ozu is constantly injecting powerful doses of ancient Japanese culture (the alcove, the stage play) that propel the story along. Although the daughter may want to continue rejecting comprimise, change and marriage, the constant presence of ancient ceremony reminds the characters that change is inevitable. (Setsuko Hara famously marks this when her head drops dejectedly while she and her father watch the Noh play). Thus the film itself a ceremony of life -- a ceremony Ozu would repeat.

Like many original films that spawn sequels, Late Spring may in fact be the best.

Criterion celebrates this with an excellent comentary track, two lucid essays, a decent print (I can't compare it to other versions, but it is mostly crisp with an occasional scratchy wave), and the inclusion of Wim Wender's 1985 feature documentary on Ozu ""Tokyo Ga.""

Often DVDs aren't worth the money because they only bear one or two viewings before they sit on the shelf. Late Spring is worthwhile, a piece of art that hasn't weathered much despite 57 years and a fascinating introduction to one of the most intimate and culturally relevant filmakers ever.",1148947200,8,2341,5.005141388174807

This is quite simply, a deeply moving and poignant family drama that is one of the great works of world cinema. Splendid music and with Criterion, the best transfer possible.  One can return to this movie many times over the course of a lifetime and find new rewards with each viewing.

2525507,4,B000EOTWIS,"I'm glad Criterion released this film.  I've been dying to see it for I don't know how long.  It was as tender and as moving as any film in the Ozu repetoire.  It also is one of the funniest and most wise of his films, and with him, that's really saying something.  Some have criticised Ozu for making the same kind of film over and over again.  I find all of his film different, yet familiar.  Great artists do that.  The final scene in this film is one of Ozu's saddest and most heartbreaking.  A must see.  AND kudos to Criterion for releasing Tokyo-Ga, Wim Wenders's wonderful documentary on Ozu, with Late Spring.  Tokyo-Ga is a documentary that Wenders made in 1983, when documentaries were few and far between.  It traces the many places where Ozu made his films, and it has interviews with many of his collaborators, including some heart breaking moments at the end of the film.  You can see the leisurely pacing of Ozu's films match Wenders's films (especially Wenders's early German work, which is NOT on DVD but should be).  It's one of Wenders's better works, and it should be seen along with this film, or any Ozu film.",1146873600,4,1132,4.517241379310345

2525510,3,B000EOTWIS,"Film = three stars; restoration = barely three stars.  This movie can be an acquired taste, but the viewer must be extremely patient during the acquisition process!  Overly long due to interior/exterior visual padding and foot-dragging direction, it nonetheless exhibits: some fine acting from many contemporaneously well-known actors and actresses; a well constructed script with many red herrings, twists, turns, and moments of great dialog (plus a phantom major character); plenty of location shots (including the Kiyomizu-dera Temple and the stone garden at Ryoan-ji in Kyoto which pretty much look the same today); good sound; and clearly-enunciated line readings.  Subtitles are right sized.  Except for an occasional pan of sea waves or fields, cinematography is spot-on static.  All action occurs within the frame (like viewing a stage play).  Even for close-ups on bikes!  However, camera placements are imaginative and lighting is well done.  On occasion, the director films the backs of speaking actors when the viewer would expect expressive frontal shots.  This back acting is interesting, but a bit disconcerting (especially when a back-acting shot is immediately followed by a duplicate front-acting one).  Music lacks imagination in composition and film placement.  It is monotonous (there is essentially only one leif motif played over and over) and often inserted into the sound track in an amateurish manner.  The serene, apparently economically-secure, middle-class society depicted here did not yet exist, and seems to have been offered up by the director as a proper modern and attainable objective (which was reached by Japan in an incredibly short time thereafter!).  Semi-restoration leaves behind wear lines, frame jittering (especially during the opening credits), and age-related deterioration during dark scenes.  WILLIAM F.

2525514,4,B000EOTWIS,"I bought this film because I already knew about it, and because it comes as a bundle with Wenders' ""Tokyo Ga"". In that respect, as usual, it is a Criterion release, so it won't let anyone down. As a product, it is as good as it can be. I couldn't help doing a comparison, though: one of my first Criterion Blu-ray discs happens to be Harold Lloyd's 1923 ""Safety Last!"", shot 26 years before ""Late Spring"", also in 35mm, and there's a huge gap between both transfers. Image stability, contrast and inherent noise, both from the analog source and from the transfer itself, seem to be more noticeable in Ozu's film that they are in Lloyd's. Of course, a lot of it has to do with the way the original source materials have been treated for decades, but I bet a lot has to do with the fact that part of the digital treatment of ""Late Spring"" was made in Imagica Japan. They are a top notch company, but they also have different standards than those of the western world when it comes to transfer and restoration aesthetics. On the other hand, I guess that being an extra feature shot in 16mm film,  Wenders' ""Tokyo Ga"" is a fine transfer, but it's not a sigificant improvement compared to other previous DVD releases.

Now, to be fair, anyone who started to watch foreign films during the Golden Age of VHS and Betamax, around the time when Wenders shot ""Tokyo Ga"", can easily overcome some of the noise of the medium in favor of a unique artistic experience, and the bundle packed in this Blu-ray is easily one of the best combos offered by Criterion for that matter. For that reason, I gave this film 4 stars because theres no 4,7 or 4,8 rating, and I just meant it comes close to a 5, again, because it's as good as it can be.",1380844800,,1724,4.367601246105919

With this perspective, I think this is his most stylish work, he started to frame his shots, established his camera angle, and build his beautiful props, cut to his pace all in this one film.

I enjoyed all of his films, but this one is very dear to my heart, as I watched them all and came back to this one, it almost gives me a feeling - yes, this is it. This is where Ozu found his mark, and I can see all of it coming together for his later masterpieces.

I do believe a true artist should not sell himself out to the commercial interest, but a true artist needs to survive and prosper like everyone else, the greatness of Ozu, at least from my personal perspective, was his willingness to take the post war melodramatic Japanese studio works, and he did these with his own style, he sighed and mocked sometime the unbearable loneliness of being in a fast changing, morally decadent society, but he never pointed it out flatly to you, he does not shout out the idioms, you will need to find it yourself, but it is all there, after many years passing by you, you will smile, nod your head and finally say to him: I understand it now.",1364515200,4,1231,4.297413793103448

2525518,5,B000EOTWIS,"Yasujiro Ozu is one of the world's beloved directors.  Having made many films since the 1920's up to his final film ""An Autumn Afternoon"" in 1962, his works have been appreciated by viewers and critics for his family comedies but also his serious family storylines such as ""Early Spring"", ""Early Summer, ""Tokyo Story"", ""Floating Weeds"", ""The End of Summer"" (to name a few).

The Criterion Collection has been one of the major forces in America of bringing Ozu's films stateside and now they are giving Ozu films the high definition treatment on Blu-ray starting with his 1949 drama film ""Late Spring"" (known in Japan as ""Banshun"").

Based on the short novel ""Chichi to Musume"" (Father and Daughter) by Kazuo Hirotsu and featuring a collaboration with screenwriter Kogo Noda, ""Late Spring"" was written and shot during the Allied Powers Occupation of Japan and undergone many changes to fit official censorship requirements.

The film would star Chishu Ryu (who would star in other Ozu films sucha s ""Early Summer"", ""Tokyo Story"", ""An Autumn Afternoon"" and the popular ""Tora-san"" films of the '70s and '80s) and Setsuko Hara (""Early Summer"", ""Tokyo Story"", ""Late Autumn"").

Over 60-years since ""Late Spring"" was shown in theaters and winning the prestigious Kinema Jumpo critic's award for ""Best Film"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Screenplay"" and ""Best Actress"", the film has resonated strongly with Ozu fans all over the world.  Many have regarded ""Late Spring"" as one of Ozu's masterpiece and the film has been listed in many ""Greatest Films of All Time"" polls.

""Late Spring"" is also a film that showcases Japanese family tradition and the importance of marriage, but also how Japan would face the issue of tradition and modern views towards marriage and also divorce.  But for Ozu fans, who have watched his silent films and have seen the development of the Japanese family and most importantly Ozu's honest portrayal of the Japanese family and the sacrifice of the parents for their children (and vice versa).

""Late Spring"" is one of those honest films featuring wonderful performances by both Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara, as the father and daughter.

VIDEO:

""Late Spring - The Criterion Collection #331"" is presented in Black and White (1:33:1 aspect ratio). Having owned the 2006 Criterion Collection DVD release, first it is important for me to say that the film does have its share of scratches and film damage (nothing that prevents a viewer from enjoying the film).  While the film does have scenes with missing frames and also occasional flickering, the film does look improved over the 2006 DVD release with much better contrast with the white and grays, but also the black levels are nice and deep.

According to the Criterion Collection, this high-definition transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm fine-grain master positive and a 35mm theatrical print. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS while Image System's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, jitter, and flicker.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Late Spring"" is presented in Japanese monaural (LPCM 1.0).  Compared to the 2006 DVD release, there appears to be much more clarity when it comes to dialogue.  While there are some moments of audio distortion on certain scenes, nothing detrimental and noticeable unless you are really looking for it.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the film's optical track. Viewers may notice significant distortion inherent in the original surviving soundtrack materials. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Late Spring - The Criterion Collection #331' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Richard Pena, program director of New York's Film Society of Lincoln Center.  This was the original audio commentary from the 2006 DVD release and quite informative as Pena is very familiar with Ozu's work.
  TOKYO-GA - (92 minutes) Wim Wenders 1985 documentary and tribute to Yasujiro Ozu, the documentary features interviews with Chishu Ryu and cinematographer Yuharu Atsuta.

EXTRAS:

""Late Spring - The Criterion Collection #331' comes with a 22-page booklet with the following essays: ""Home with Ozu"" by Michael Atkinson (Village Voice writer), Ozu and Setsuko Hara by Donald Richie (author of many books on Japanese cinema) and Ozu and Kogo Noda, an excerpt from Yasujiro Ozu: The Person and His Art (1964) from Ozu, translated for the original 2006 DVD release of ""Late Spring"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a person who loves and enjoys Yasujiro Ozu films, ""Late Spring"" has always been a favorite because of how it confronts Japanese perspective on the traditional marriage but now with a modern perspective, different from Ozu films which relied heavily on themes of the traditional Japanese family.

From the beginning of the film, we realize that the Somiya family are different compared to other families shown in previous Ozu films.  For one, Professor Somiya had not shown great pressure towards his daughter Noriko, possibly because she does so much in taking care of him and the house but yet remains very happy.  The other reason is because Noriko had health problems during World War II and as a father, having lost a wife, the last thing he wanted was to lose his only child and I believe that was his drive for not putting too much pressure on her.  She's happy and that's all that mattered.

But of course, what seemed natural to Professor Somiya, the more he started to see how others viewed Noriko being single at home.  This is where the traditional Japanese culture clashes with modernism.  In ""Late Spring"", we see Aunt Masa giving her brother and also Noriko the third degree about being married.  It's her duty to be married and be a happy wife.  But for Noriko, she's happy the ways she is.

And this is where Noriko is unlike previous Japanese wives featured in Ozu's films.  She is absolutely beautiful, stylish (in Western wear) and is not wearing a kimono.  She has her set way of thinking, the freedom to think that way as it has gone unchallenged until now...when it comes to marriage.  And with someone who is set in her ways...what can her father do?

And thus, the storyline becomes quite intriguing when we are told that Noriko's father may be getting remarried to another woman.  And this is enough to set the happy Noriko off.  Remarriage has always been seen indecent to her but from this point on, we see the change that takes place between both characters.  The father submitting to the classic Japanese tradition, even though he was brought up in that tradition of arranged marriage, he himself had seen how his wife reacted to it earlier on.  So, as much as he wants Noriko to find the right man that she wants to marry, the pressure from his sister and others have led him to lead Noriko in the path to marriage.

And for Noriko, we eventually see the change in her, as her father getting married leads her to realize that she may need to get married now, because with her father having a new wife, perhaps she will no longer be needed.

If anything, it's an intriguing juxtaposition of the Japanese family in 1949.  From traditional to modern, and with the modern, we see Professor Onodera having remarried, while Noriko's good friend Aya has gotten a divorce (which was made legal in Japan a year prior).  And most intriguing is how Ozu manages to confront these changes in Japanese culture when it comes to marriage.

Bare in mind, postwar changes were in store for Japan after World War II and the most affected were women.  The social status of women was them being subservient towards their husband and after World War II, women not only were granted the right to a divorce, they were also allowed to join the workforce.  So, we started to see more freedom for women after World War II and the importance of family started to decline.  In fact, what I enjoy about ""Last Spring"" is how it is a time stamp of Japanese culture and the changing of family life which Ozu would feature throughout his career through his films.  And for those familiar with Japanese culture today, from the shrinking of the Japanese population to a country with the lowest birth rate in the world, the Japanese family has changed tremendously and we witness those changes through Ozu's films.

As ""Late Spring"" will be an introduction to Ozu's work for those viewing Criterion Collection films primarily on Blu-ray, another fascination that I have towards Ozu films is his camera technique, using low angle shots and also using non-traditional cinematic methods by avoiding panning, tracking and crane shots.  It's what separates Ozu from Kurosawa and that the reliance of Ozu to use static compositions and also his use of pillow shots used in ""Late Spring"" and various shots of symbolism which intrigues me each time I read various historians and critics share their own perspective of what they think those shots are all about.

And as mentioned, the efficacy of this film relies on its characters.  It's one thing to have a talented Chishu Ryu to play the father, but it's Setsuko Hara, who absolutely shines in this film with her energy followed by her change of emotion.  For those who watch a lot of early Japanese cinema, you don't see actresses such as Setsuko Hara play a character and is able to captivate the audience.

Overall, ""Late Spring"" is a fantastic film that captures the changing of Japanese family life and the clash between traditional and modern perspectives.  But it's also a film, among many other Ozu films that shows us why Yasujiro Ozu is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  Captivating and powerful, ""Late Spring"" is a magnificent portrayal of the changing Japanese family and a film that I highly recommend!",1336176000,10,9989,4.950239808153477
2525519,5,B000EOTWIS,"This is a quintessential Ozu film, with unforgettable performances by two Ozu luminaries, the beloved Setsuko Hara as Noriko, and Chishu Ryu as her father, Shukichi Nomiya. Obasan Masa is played by Haruko Sugimura, another Ozu regular, who often plays the role of the meddlesome matchmaking auntie.
The story could not be simpler. Noriko, at 27, is approaching the limit of marriageable age for Japanese women. She lives with her father, a professor, and cares for him in a mutually symbiotic relationship. However, the people around her, her friend Aya-chan (herself a divorcee) and Aunt Masa, are pressuring Noriko to marry. The professor, also, is eventually persuaded by their arguments.
Masa is keen to see Shukichi remarry as well as his daughter, and she proposes a match with a younger widow. Shukichi is uninterested, but Masa plants a seed of doubt in Noriko's mind, and when she and her father see the widow at a Noh performance, she is inflamed with jealousy.
Obasan proposes an arranged marriage for Noriko with a candidate she knows. Noriko refuses to consider it, but when she is told that her father intends to remarry, she confronts him. He lies, telling her that he does indeed intend to marry the widow, the one they saw at the Noh performance. This pivotal scene is played to perfection by Chishu Ryu, who affirms his marriage intentions with such ambiguity that one might easily absolve him of any untruthfulness. Shukichi later describes this as `the biggest lie I ever told.'
Believing that her blissful twosome is about to end, Noriko bows to inevitability and reluctantly accepts the proposal of the suitor Obasan has picked out for her. On the eve of her wedding, she pleads with Shukichi one last time: she wants to go on as they are with no change. In a very eloquent and moving speech, he tells her that she must marry because it is the right and natural thing to do. His life is nearing its end. It will not be easy, as his own marriage to Noriko's mother was not, but if she will endure, she will find true happiness ultimately.
We see Noriko in her bridal attire. In the final scene, Shukichi peels an apple, awkwardly as if he is unaccustomed to the task (which in fact is true, since Noriko has always done these tasks for him). He nods and apparently falls asleep. Though Roger Ebert interprets this last scene as an expression of the old man's grief, I don't see it quite that way. Ebert elsewhere superimposes his own values on Ozu's film:

""What happens at deeper levels is angry, passionate and -- wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something neither one of them wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness.""

 I believe this does not do justice to the complexity of Ozu's art. That both Noriko and her father are content with their arrangement and would prefer not to change it is unquestionable. The pressures that force them to leave that arrangement behind are inexorable: the force of time passing more than social mores. Shikata ga nai, is how the Japanese would express it: ""It can't be helped."" Will resentment and unhappiness follow?"" Perhaps, or perhaps adjustment and resignation, followed by contentment.
In Autumn Afternoon, another Ozu film, there is a scene in which Hirayama goes to call on his old professor, `The Gourd' to deliver a gift of money collected from his classmates. The old man lives with his grown daughter, in this case well past marrying age. After the guests have left, she breaks down and sobs. Within the context of this film, I believe it is clear that this woman is grieving for the life that has passed her by. Compelled by tradition to care for her widowed father, she has missed the chance to marry and have a family of her own, and she now faces a solitary old age.
In this as in Ozu's other films, the subtleties of the Japanese family dynamic are explored with extraordinary sensitivity. For those unfamiliar with the work of this legendary director, Late Spring is an excellent",1294012800,2,4014,4.731428571428571
2525520,5,B000EOTWIS,"This beautifully mounted film from Yasujiro Ozu is an astounding achievement in simplicity. Using the camera lens like an artist uses a brush, he makes tiny marks on the canvas whose beauty is only fully revealed when we stand back upon its completion, deeply moved by the restful and poignant portrait of family love and sacrifice in front of us. Ozu attains an intimacy on film not reached again until Vietnam's Tran came close, in The Scent of Green Papaya and The Vertical Ray of the Sun, many decades later. The placid beauty and tenderness of Late Spring, however, is unmatched.

Cinematographer Yuharu Atsuta beautifully captures Ozu's minimalist and intimate approach to storytelling. Ozu himself had began his career in silent films as a cameraman, allowing him to speak with elegance through the camera lens; letting it linger on an evocative scene, or a face, creating a narrative of depth and poignancy which required a minimum of dialog. Major events are often alluded to, but rarely shown onscreen, as the director shows the fluidity of life in broader terms, by focusing on family and love. Studying American films in Singapore, he had his own vision as a filmmaker, and his works are among the most Japanese in style and substance. Like Orson Welles, he had sort of a stock company of players who appeared in most of his films. Lovely Setsuko Hara is enchanting as Noriko, giving a beautifully realized and realistic performance as an old-fashioned girl who cares so deeply for her widowed father, she has not married, and moved forward with her own life.

Setsuko became a symbol of the golden era in Japanese cinema thanks to Ozu, though she is perhaps even more revered in America. Her talents were vast, but intertwined so closely with the director, she quit films the same year he passed on, living quietly and without publicity. A placidity is immediately captured in Late Spring, the viewer feeling privy to scenes of intimate family life which intoxicates them, like the warm sake Noriko's father, Shukichi Somiya (Chishu Ryu), drinks in the evening. Noriko is shown to be a lovely and happy girl, full of warmth and humor. Bit by bit, by keeping his camera focused on her, a broader canvas is revealed, however, as if the camera had been pulled back for a long shot. Slowly revealed is the tender portrait of wonderful girl who loves her aging, and often difficult to manage, father. So deep is her love and affection for him, she has sacrificed her own prospects at joining the flowing waters of life reaching Japan's shores. Her father's sister, Masa (Haruko Sugimura), broaches this subject, causing him to consider remarriage, something his 27 year old daughter, finds repugnant.

Arranging for Noriko to meet an eligible man proves painful, as she must be dragged towards living her life by her loving father and pushy aunt. Ozu shows her to be independent and remarkable, while at the same time not dismissive of Japanese tradition. The viewer is left wondering if spring has passed for Noriko, and senses her hurt at her father's intention to remarry, and marry her off, even to a man who 'looks like Gary Cooper'. Many baseball terms are used in this Ozu masterpiece, showing the fascination with the sport still rampant in Japanese society. Noriko is surprised that she likes her suitor, and is encouraged to get married by her good friend, Aya (Yumeji Tsukioka). A quiet conversation full of great wisdom, between a father and daughter, is wonderfully captured by Ozu's camera, and the wedding is set. Their last trip together to Kyoto will reveal a great sacrifice, however, revealed to Aya over sake. Tender and deeply moving is the final shot of Ozu's masterwork, the canvas he has painted on now fully exposed to the light, and visible for all to see.

A beautiful film of great intimacy, showing both love and sacrifice between a daughter and her father, this is a film which lingers in the heart long after it is over. A lovely film from a fine director, and an excellent example of the less is more school of thought. Beautiful.",1276128000,5,4070,4.835007173601148
2525521,5,B000EOTWIS,"Late Spring (Yasujiro Ozu, 1949)

As I sat down to write this review and pulled up the movie's IMDB page, I saw a link to a rumination from David Thomson (under the guide of a review of the new James Cameron film) on the increasing obscurity of Ozu. There is a feeling among critics, one that has now bled out into the public consciousness, that nothing much happens in Ozu films. Thomson, in dissecting Tokyo Monogatari for his wonderful book Have You Seen...?, puts the word ""action"" in quotation marks every time he uses it in the first paragraph, and ""Ozu-like"" (or, if you're pretentious, ""Ozu-esque"") has become synonymous for slow, if powerful. I disagree with this sentiment vehemently. As a piece of evidence, I offer you the first five minutes of Banshun, known in the English-speaking world as Late Spring. It is a seemingly minor conversation between two characters, the unmarried-yet-lovely daughter (Setsuko Hara, who would play another character named Noriko in Tokyo Monogatari) of a salaryman, Shukichi Somiya (Chishu Ryu, who appeared in the first forty-five[!] Tora-san films), and her aunt Mara (Kaidan's Haruko Sugimura). There is as much a power struggle in this scene as there is in Eisenstein's famed battle on the ice in Alexander Nevsky, just without the axes and horses. And yet people think nothing happens in Ozu films. Just look as Setsuko Hara's expressions as she tries to break out of the rigid system of Japanese culture. She is, after all, twenty-seven and unmarried (Hara was actually twenty-nine at the time the film was made); this is a woman who wants to be a strong Japanese female while she's still young enough to enjoy being a strong Japanese female. And yet her aunt is able to put her back in her place with a few well-chosen sentences. And keep looking at Hara's face, as her rebelliousness turns to defeat. Nothing is happening here? Perish the thought.

In any case, the plot of the film is that Shukichi (driven mostly by Mara's machinations) wants to get Noriko married off, while she would much rather stay single and under her father's roof. There is no outward Electra complex going on here--Ozu is both far too decorous, and far too subtle, a filmmaker to allow that--but even the thickest viewer has to see what's going on. In this, too, Noriko is a rebellious woman. One might think she's seen one too many Mae West movies, if you can imagine any member of this clan going to see a movie at all. But there's also a deep-seated need for simple comfort in Noriko; remember that this is just after World War II. Many of her male classmates are now dead, and she spent a good deal of her childhood in a labor camp. So there's that as well. Add to this the fact that Shukichi is not the sole author of this plot to get Noriko married off, though he is its most visible arm, and he convinces himself it's a great idea relatively quickly. You know there's a ""what will the neighbors think?"" subtext going on here that ties right back into that Electra complex that so very few people who discuss the movie will even acknowledge, much less dissect. None of this, by the way, is to suggest any sort of prurient interest on the parts of either Shukickhi or Noriko; it's all unconscious, but it adds another layer of characterization. (And if you want to get meta, remember that Ozu himself never married, living with his mother until he died; it's not much of a leap to suggest Banshun as Ozu's most personal film.) There are other layers underneath all this (Noriko's reaction to Shukichi's revelation halfway through the filmlooks way over the top, for example, until you get to the final scene of the film...then it all becomes clear), but in the end, it's a superb character study of Noriko, Shukichi, and their relationship. Of this film, the Cleveland Cinematheque said, ""[it is] one of the best films made by Yasujiro Ozu, which makes it one of the best films ever made by anyone."" They are, of course, absolutely correct. **** ",1271289600,,3981,4.700573065902579

This wonderful movie, called a ""masterpiece"" by many critics, is a quiet, subtle, and gentle look at the loving relationship between a father and daughter.  It also captures forever post-war Japan when traditional manners and customs were practiced, kimonos were a common sight, and there were no tourists to be seen.  The movie takes its time exploring Noriko's world and her reasons for not marrying; the final scenes are quite touching and universally appealing.

2525523,5,B000EOTWIS,"Director Yasujiro Ozu's ""Late Spring"" (1949) tells the story of a widowed Japanese professor and his unmarried 27-year-old daughter, Noriko (Setsuko Hara).  Noriko tends to her father and their home, joking that he couldn't make it without her.  The pair seems content with this arrangement, but their friends and relatives begin to note that it's time for Noriko to marry.  Noriko and her father simply laugh off this pressure, but eventually the professor's sister convinces him that Noriko cannot take care of him forever.  Persuading Noriko is more difficult, and the professor may have to deceive her in order to do so.

""Late Spring"" depicts the shifting societal mores in post-WWII Japan, as the younger generation started to abandon the traditional Japanese way of life.  When Noriko visits her aunt, they sit on the floor wearing kimonos for a formal tea ceremony; when she visits her divorced friend, they sit perched on chairs wearing Western-style clothes and eat shortcake.  The contrast is striking.  Even the older generation is changing subtly, and Noriko expresses disgust when one of her father's friends remarries.

The film is a simply-told, serene masterpiece; the deliberate pace allows this unadorned story to unfold realistically.  ""Late Spring"" is not a talky Western-style film filled with self-revelation, confessions, and epiphanies.  We never hear directly from Noriko why she seems doesn't want to marry - we have to discern it from her actions and bits of dialogue.  Ozu's focus on measured character development makes the movie greatly affecting.  Some audiences may balk at the slow pace and the formality of ""Late Spring.""  However, patient audiences will be richly rewarded by this beautiful tale of the sacrifices people make for their loved ones.  I think this film is even better than ""Tokyo Story,"" which many people consider to be Ozu's finest film.",1247961600,2,1889,5.208609271523179
2525524,5,B000EOTWIS,"If one were to think of an equivalent to the film style of director Yasujiro Ozu it would have to be long novels suffused with detail, but never superfluous detail. Books such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick- with its descriptions of the whaling industry and vessels, John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath- with its detailed rendering of the lives of migrant workers, and especially Betty Smith's A Tree Grows In Brooklyn- with its child-like view of a world that overwhelms fresh senses, come to mind, even though the film checks in at a mid-length range of an hour and forty-eight minutes. Ozu's cinema is utterly shorn of melodrama, for all that occurs within its frames advances some aspect of narrative, character development, or social commentary. Yet, some of the most affecting scenes in the whole of his 1949 film, Late Spring (Banshun), are realistic shots of toenail clippings or apple peels, designed to allow the viewer to feel they are intruding in on the reality of the characters. Then there are seemingly throwaway details that also lend authenticity, such as when a meter reader from the electric company comes and requires a stool to read the meter. It has nothing to do with the tale nor symbolism, but immediately `realizes' the situation for most viewers, especially when a more important character has to get the stool for the ephemeral character.
  This film not only was a change in technique and tenor for Ozu, from more socially blunt works, but marked the beginning of the final phase of Ozu's long career, where his focus became almost exclusively the Japanese family unit in the post-war transition years, and his camera movement started to become more and more static with every film released. The film was penned by Ozu and longtime collaborator Kgo Noda, from a novel called Father And Daughter, by Kazuo Hirotsu. The very naturalistic style of the screenplay and camera work lends an air of realism to Ozu's style that has often been compared to Italian Neo-Realism of the same era, although Ozu's work from this era was never as overtly political as that of the Italian filmmakers. The film follows the life of an aging father, a professor, Shukichi Somiya (Chishu Ryu), and his twenty-seven year old daughter, Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who still lives at home. Worried over her ending up alone, and prodded on by Noriko's aunt Masa Taguchi (Haruko Sugimura)- sister of Shukichi or his wife (it's never delineated), he tries to push his daughter out of the nest and into marital bliss. We never learn what happened to the wife and mother of the household, but we can guess she was killed in the war. We do learn that Noriko was in a labor camp and was very ill and skinny, but has now gotten healthy and plump, according to one of Shukichi's Academic colleagues, Jo Onodera (Masao Mishima), whose remarriage Noriko deems distasteful and filthy. Onodera is a jovial man, and merely one of many who seems to obsess on Noriko's marital status.... What makes Late Spring a great film is that, like great classic novels, it is never preachy nor condescending, but involving. Think of the great novels I compared it to, and then think of the crap put out in recent years by big name authors such as Joyce Carol Oates, T.C. Boyle, or Toni Morrison, and then think of this film and preachy PC films like Brokeback Mountain or Crash, and the comparative difference is manifest. Late Spring can be political when a character takes up an empty seat with his belongings or when Hara forces a smile. One need not have a character stick his tongue down another male character's throat, nor his fingers between a female characters' leg to denote the political stance of the film and filmmaker.
  Then there are the terrific technical cinematographic aspects of the film- by Yuharu Atsuta, such as Ozu's patented low angle shots; eyeline mismatches; limited camera movement- such as when Noriko and Hattori go biking, yet it seems as if the world moves by them, not the other way around; the lack of interstitial fades and dissolves; as well as narrative devices, such as ellipses- as when we see Noriko's devastation at her father's supposed remarriage, and then transition to her seemingly positive and happy reaction to meeting `Gary Cooper;' and transition shots of unidentified locations to link themes and elided time intervals. In many ways, the camera of Ozu frames life similarly to that of Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer, or the great Dutch painting masters, where space, the tension built by spare movement, and the relative positioning of characters is all important.
  Ozu has tritely been labeled the most Japanese of all directors by lazy critics, as opposed to his two great contemporaries- Kenji Mizoguchi and the far more famous Akira Kurosawa, both of whose reputations were made with historical dramas, but Ozu is actually the most modern of all the classic directors from Japan, and probably the most Western, if not in approach then in attitude. Late Spring shows this to be true, and considering that the film was a distinct reinvention of the man's art, its success is all the more noteworthy. It's akin to a minor dime store novelist from the late 19th Century all of a sudden morphing into Mark Twain. Were most midlife crises handled as ably- nay, greatly- as this the work of such an artist as Yasujiro Ozu would not be needed to illumine the problem. It almost makes one wish for the human race to be continued to be plagued with ills, for only then will the relevance of such artistic rendering still be appreciated, right along with the greatest of novels and novelists.
  And the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago....",1221350400,3,5705,4.838114754098361
2525525,5,B000EOTWIS,"Many of Ozu's films are variations on a theme.  He would take essentially the same characters, and essentially the same them, but run them through a different set of circumstances.  Always about the family, sometimes he would focus on the sons, sometimes the mother, sometimes the father, and sometimes the daughter.  When the daughter is involved, there are sure to be prospects of marriage.

""Late Spring"" (""Banshun"") is a Father/Daughter play, focusing on the relationship that can develop when a widower father is being tended to by his single daughter.  Both are happy with the relationship, and love each other, but know deep down that the daughter must leave to live her own life, that happiness cannot be found only in being a dutiful child, but that a woman can also be a wife, a lover, a mother and many other things that are closed to her when she takes on the role of platonic wife and caregiver to her father. The father must free the caged bird that his is daughter, even though it will decrease his own happiness.  He knows she will never leave on her own, so he devises a plot that he will re-marry, and that he doesn't need her anymore.

The usual cast is assembled.  Ryu Chishu is the father in this movie, as he would be again in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>, although he was the older brother in the similar-themed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Early-Summer/dp/B00026L7MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Early Summer</a>.  Hara Setsuko is, of course, the loving and perfect daughter Noriko, the same name her character would take in almost every Ozu film.  These two are the consummate Ozu actors, able to realize his vision and themes so fluidly and naturally it is impossible to see anyone else in their roles.

As usual, Ozu's genius with imagery and subtly is beautiful to behold.  Two people walking by a Coca Cola sign becomes so much more, even though nothing overt must be said.  The unspoken element is far more important than the dialog, and all the still waters of the surface churn with hidden depths and struggles.  The new subtitles by Kerim Yasar are a perfect vehicle for non-Japanese speakers to connect with the story.  Very little is lost in translation, and it is a good collaboration between the two.

This Criterion DVD also contains the documentary Tokyo-Ga, directed by Wim Wenders. Not specific to ""Late Spring"", it seeks the world of Ozu, visiting locations and interviewing old cast members to try and understand the simple secrets.  It is an excellent addition, and sets a good stage for those who have never seen Ozu before, but would like to know more.",1214352000,2,2757,5.215419501133787

She cares for him as a wife might, making him dinner at night and mending his socks. He worries about her; she is already 27 years old and seems to have no intentions of marriage. He and his sister (Haruko Sugimura) gang up on Noriko to find her a husband, but she feels betrayed by her family. She feels she can be no happier than she already is and does not want to abandon her father.

Be forewarned that this movie is not filled with action. In fact, you may find yourself wondering when things are going to get going. The style of the film simulates reality. Something exciting does not happen everyday, so neither does it in this film. This approach makes the characters seem more relatable, and the performances given are excellent. Hara is beautiful and subtly emotional. Ryu is very lovable with his toothy grin and easy-going manner. Sugimura is delightfully funny.

The picture is beautiful, which complements the photography wonderfully. There are a few moments of scratchiness toward the end, but it is easily ignored. The most memorable scenes are those set in Kyoto, especially the outdoors scenes. One can just feel the fresh breeze and the warm sun glowing down. Many of the shots are taken from low angles, which gives the audience an interesting perspective. There is minimal movement throughout the film, which leaves one feeling calm and introspective. The theme of change is very powerful, but it is presented in a very non-threatening way. Perhaps this is why Ozu is so effective as a director.",1203552000,3,1693,4.834482758620689

2525536,5,B000EOTWIS,"Late Spring, or Banshun is another of Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro's portraits and commentaries on Japanese social life.  The widowed Professor Somiya lives in Kamakura with his daughter Noriko, who is 27.  That is way past normal marrying age for Japanese women, and when his sister says something should be done about it, the wheels are set in motion for the destruction of Noriko's harmonious world.  Looking after her father, seeing to the cleaning and cooking, is the happiest moment of her life.  She enjoys herself in her free time, whether it's going to Tokyo or biking to the beach with Hattori, the dashing young assistant of her father.  Marriage is the last thing on her mind, as she still values her independence, but feels that she alone knows her father's set ways and it's best if she stays with him.

Noriko's own observations of marriage include that of Professor Onodera, a colleague of her father's who has remarried.  For some reason she thinks it's wrong and calls him indecent, which he laughs off.  Like Onodera's daughter Misako, Noriko seems to think that ""marriage is the life's graveyard.""  Her classmate Aya is divorced and working as a stenographer.  Though disappointed with the experience, using a baseball metaphor, she optimistically thinks she will hit a home run next time.

However, Noriko's pushy aunt plans to get her niece married off as soon as possible, even cooking up a plan where her brother plans to marry a certain Ms. Miwa.  With Ms. Miwa as woman of the house, Noriko won't be of any use.  She even sets up an arranged marriage meeting or omiai, a match for Noriko.  This upsets Noriko to no end, and even finds her friend Aya forcing her to get married.  The way Noriko avoids the issue, whether changing the subject or getting upset is truly childlike.  From a Westerner's point of view, one might sympathetically think, ""Well, why not let her stay on and heck with tradition?""  But with the Japanese, one must follow the custom and expectations according to their role, in ""the order of human life in history.""  Omiai is much akin to the arranged marriages of the noble European families, who married for political alliances and not love, and there is the concept of marrying into a good family and a man in a great social standing, jobwise;  in other words, it's more economic consideration.

Professor Somiya's gentle with his daughter, tender even.  His talk of happiness in marriage is spoken from a Japanese cultural perspective, but it does give one pause.  ""Marriage may not mean happiness from the start.  To expect such immediate happiness is a mistake.  Happiness isn't something you wait around for.  It's something you create yourself.  Getting married isn't happiness.  Happiness lies in the forging of a new life shared together. ... Happiness comes only through effort.  Only then can you claim to be man and wife.""

There's a thoughtful scene when Onodera and Somiya contemplate the Zen rock garden at a Kyoto temple.  Somiya says on the pointlessness of having a daughter.  ""You raise them up and off they go.  If they're unwed, you worry.  Yet if they do marry, you feel let down.""  ""But didn't we marry other men's daughters?"" points out Onodera.

As in all of Ozu's post-war films, Late Spring features the regular cast of performers he used in Ohayou and Tokyo Monogatari, to name a few.  At this point, Hara Setsuko-san is the most beautiful Japanese actress I've seen.  With a class and elegance, I see her as Japan's Audrey Hepburn, full of expression in that dazzling smile, but equally expressive in that dark scowl of hers.

Note:  when Professors Onodera and Somiya are discussing directions of Tokyo, the ocean, and the shrine relative to Kamakura, instead of the word shrine, the word ""hachiman"" is used, meaning the famed Hachimangu Shrine inbetween Kita-Kamakura and Kamakura stations.

Ryu Chishu plays a kindly role as Noriko's father.  Other Ozu players that appear include Sugimura Haruko as Noriko's aunt and Miyake Kuniko as Ms. Miwa.  In Ozu's Ohayou (Good Morning), Ryu and Miyake play husband and wife, and parents to the kids who demand a TV.

With Ohayou, I was taken by Ozu's commentary on Japanese society, but with Banshun, a classic I'd like to watch over and over, I realized that his films harken more to the heart of Japan than Kurosawa Akira.",1185321600,,4347,4.849184782608695
2525537,5,B000EOTWIS,"A lovingly crafted fable about family relations in mid-century Japan, ""Late Spring"" is a testament to Ozu's elegant visual style and tranquil humanism. Two of his favorite actors, Ryu and the resplendent Hara, have an especially beautiful rapport in this touching story of sacrifice, which hinges on Noriko's cheerful willingness to forego freedom, and Somiya's desire to see Noriko married, though he knows he'll lead a lonely life without her. With consummate skill, Ozu uses shots of parks, walkways, and gardens to illustrate his characters' emotional states. Poignant and languorously paced, this is a masterful study of father-daughter affection.",1182729600,,652,5.595959595959596
2525538,5,B000EOTWIS,"LATE SPRING's story is like a wisp of a breeze. So subtle is it that it would be a shame to reveal too many details and possibly ruin your 'experience' of this. If you're the type who wants some, check out other reviews. I intend to reveal as little as possible.

After some 20 minutes of glimpses into the comfortable everyday lives of a widower and his 27-year-old daughter living near Tokyo, we are given the first indication of the possible threat to that idyllic life. It grows gradually, until it becomes an aching poignancy that carries to the end of the film.

There's no real outburst of emotion. Only a couple almost understated moments of honest expression amid tons of near-ritualistic Japanese etiquette, often with the people wearing broad masking smiles. (I'm part Japanese and it still seems somewhat alien to me.)

This is all filmed in director Ozu's exquisite style, still potent despite being in black and white. (I'm glad I first saw the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stories-of-Floating-Weeds-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0001GH5RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stories of Floating Weeds - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;by the same director because it had Roger Ebert's film commentary which taught me how to watch an Ozu film.)

As for DVD extras, I skipped thru most of Wim Wender's 90-minute tribute to Ozu, altho, near the end, it has a fascinating piece on Ozu's camera setups. In the commentary by Richard Pea, background information gives way to extensive interpretion the scenes (I prefer the other way around).

Sadly, this is film that could use some first class restoration work to eliminate the signs of decay. It certainly deserves it.",1182556800,,1708,5.430188679245283
2525539,5,B000EOTWIS,"There might not be a director that personifies ""profundity through simplicity"" like Ozu. Unlike Kurosawa and Mizoguchi, Ozu relied on the deepest humanities of his strong characterizations to create a dynamic and moving rendering of his simplest of narratives. In all honesty, I've not seen anything or anyone in film like Ozu. With that, I get to Late Spring. If there was ever a simpler narrative premise I don't know of one. A daughter - Noriko, played perfectly by Ozu mainstay Setsuko Hara - stays at home to help her aging father - Shukichi, played perfectly by Ozu mainstay Chishu Ryu. The father soon realizes it's time for his daughter to marry. The daughter's ambivalent feelings towards marriage are inclined towards not doing so out of love and dedication to her father. So the father crafts a small white lie of his impending re-marriage to gently nudge the daughter out of the nest.

No description of the narrative however could give any insight into the immense and poignant power of this film. The gentle interplay between Noriko and Shukichi is largely what makes this film so great. Through this, we get to know these characters so intimately we feel as if we know them not as fictional characters, but as very real ones. It's not just the fact that they are so likable, it's the fact that they're so human. Ozu's depictions of everyday people in everyday life confronting life's small but meaningful moments is what drives it all. Late Spring simply allows us a look into the lives of two people we feel we know from the beginning. By the end, their emotions effect us as much as them. The final scene of Ryu peeling a fruit (and I'll leave it there so as not to spoil it) carries infinitely more weight and emotion than it should. But this scene perfectly illustrates Ozu's ability to take the simple and make it profound.

The moving scenes are not just saved for the closing however. The extended Noh play serves as the film's centerpiece, and the turning point for its main characters. For 7 minutes we're allowed to view something that is likely completely alien to all of America, if not Western Civilization. But the words in the play actually reflect many of the underlying themes of the film. And a simple look and smile on Shukichi's part to his potential wife, and the noticing of this by Noriko, serves as the catalyst for the rest of the film. The scene immediately afterwards of Noriko and Shukichi walking side by side, only to have Noriko separate to go her own way, is perhaps my favorite scene in the film for what it represents.

Much has been said of Ozu's style in technical terms - low angle shots, sparse camera movement. But I'd like to comment on the emotional effect this style has. I would describe Ozu's style as one that's as minimally intrusive and obtrusive as possible. This essentially creates a window in the lives of very real people. One can almost gets the impression that they're not watching a brilliant film, but a real life documentary into the lives of its characters.  What we end up with is a snapshot of a time and place, and most importantly of people whose lives end up mattering to us. It's startling how many subtleties this film reveals with repeat viewings. The reason for this is because of the underlying themes that Ozu expresses throughout the film. They are told in such intricate, subtle ways, that the complex depths of those ideas are revealed only with repeat viewings.

I honestly don't know if I can heap enough acclaim onto this film. Although not for everyone and every taste, this is a film unlike any other you're likely to ever see. The phrase ""They sure don't make them like this anymore"" springs to mind. Also, no review of this size could bring into light everything that makes this film so rich. Ozu's style combines with emotional characterization and an elaborate world in which they exist with underlying themes that are delicate, but extremely subtle and important. This creates a work that is so multi-layered, one can only choose a few layers while leaving out many others.

It's astounding to think that in this day of Plasma screens and 1080p and 5.1 surround sound and all the effects that CGI and computers can generate, a film as simple and quiet as this can be as effectively affecting as it is. Indeed, Late Spring as well as Ozu's other masterworks are more real in their fiction than all of reality television put together, and more deeply rich and rewarding than most anything you're likely to ever see.",1179792000,3,4510,4.695322376738306
2525540,5,B000EOTWIS,"I almost hate writing reviews about movies like this, because there are only so many superlatives I know.  Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful & touching films ever --- an utterly convincing portrait of a father/daughter relationship which must be forever changed.  Noriko is perfectly content with this idyllic relationship as it is, but her father knows that ultimately she will be unfulfilled if she does not move on with her life, and in what has to be one of the most wonderful scenes I have ever seen in a film, he explains the essence of marriage & the creation of a new life & persona within the marriage.  That scene alone is worth the price of the DVD.

Of course, with Criterion, you get what you pay for --- lots of really good commentary (discussing this movie within the greater context of Ozu's career, as well as an examination of everyday life in Occupied Japan) and other features.  Five stars really doesn't seem to be enough for this.  Every father of a daughter ought to watch this, I think.",1172448000,5,1022,4.557377049180328
2525541,5,B000EOTWIS,"They haven't made any films like this in decades, anywhere in the world. From a time when the word decency could be used more as a weapon than as a boomerang. Traditional family values is what we have here exposed, without lecturing. Those film critics that talk so much nonsense about Japanese films are just a bunch of hippies with bow ties, proletarians in nike shoes. John Ford himself made many movies like this one, where family values are proclaimed and sanctified thru his artistry, but critics don't want to see that, they only see what they want. Well, here's this director from Japan, right after WWII, giving us a last tour of the good old times when they are about to change.

Sure, it's about a father and his lovely daughter. But at the same time it's about those times I was talking about. The daughter doesn't want to change, just like all the decent people wouldn't want to change; but it's inevitable. It's life's law. Progress cannot be stopped, and daughters must marry off, to start a new family, maybe new societies.

There are such things as good and bad families. Just as there's right and wrong. This is a wonderful film. But I've seen more old films like this one, and they weren't Japanese. They were American and European. Why not give them the same Criterion treatment? Are ""traditional values"" only nice when they apply to foreign cultures? I see a double standard in these phony critics. Whatever they say about this film, it is not one that disfunctional families can feel identified with.",1172361600,4,1522,4.696629213483146
2525542,5,B000EOTWIS,"In Late Spring (Banshun in Japanese), the luminous Setsuko Hara stars as the daughter of a respected and widowed professor. She is single and in her late twenties, and by the standards of the Japanese society of the time, she already should be married. The movie, as many have noted, has a similar plot to another Ozu movie of the time: Early Summer. In both films, the plot deals with the ""problem"" of having to marry Hara. The main difference is that Late Spring is more lineal, less messy, more stylized and eventually sadder than Early Summer. Also, in this movie her eventual husband is never shown. If I have to decide which of these two wonderful movies is the better one, I would vote for Banshun. Not less because it has a number of scenes wonderful by themselves, like the segment of the theater (with the camera fixing on Hara expression), the bicycle race in the beach early in the film, or the speech by the professor to her daughter later in the film on the necessity of her to marry (despite the fact that he will now have to live alone) because as time passes, the cycle of life should be respected.",1168387200,5,1115,4.470588235294118
2525543,5,B000EOTWIS,"Along with Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu belongs to that pantheon of directors whose greatness is rarely achieved by others. And as time progresses ever onward, I find myself more and more gravitated towards the simplicity of Ozu's cinamatic masterpieces of the gentle, subtle and profoundly moving themes of his works. Although ""Tokyo Story"" remains one of my favorite works by Ozu, his other films are by no means any lesser in quality. In fact, they are ALL just as great. The film ""Late Spring"" is classic Ozu, he never tells the story, but allows the nuances of his characters to speak more than words alone can do.

In ""Late Spring"" Ozu's topic is marriage. When a widowed father (Chishu Ryu) urges his daughter (Setsuko Hara) to marry. The daughter, who has grown accustomed to living with her father, does not wish to marry. For her main desire is to look out for her father as he grows old. However, there is also the fear of the unknown. Leaving the life she is comfortable with, and exchanging it for that great unknown: Marriage. Moreover, the film gives a great narrative in dealing with traditional marriage, and marriage for love.

Ozu weaves a great film showing [not telling] of the domestic struggles  that are now beginning to confront and change post-war Japan. The traditional roles of women have changed, and with the new constitution and American presence in Japan bringing in Western ideals, women are now begining to assert a greater control over their lives. The DVD by CRITERION is wonderful. The first Disc contains the film, with optional commentary by Richard Pena. The second Disc contains Wim Wender's film Tokyo-Ga, which is a tribute to Ozu and Japan. This film is highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1166227200,2,1729,4.874149659863946

8112185,5,B000EOTWIS,"Ever since I first watched ""Tokyo Story"" years ago I realised that I was watching the work of genius and it made me want to explore more of Ozu's work.  When Sight & Sound made it the best movie ever made (Directors' List) on its latest list over ""Citizen Kane"" I knew many others agreed with me.  I decided to have a look at another of Ozu's films that made the list and I am not disappointed.  Although I believe ""Tokyo Story"" is still the overall better film this one ""Late Spring"" ranks not that far away in my books.  Ozu has an uncanny ability to tell stories and explain the complexities of human relationships so well through film and especially familial ones that you can't help but to be affected and touched irrespective of what culture or ethnic background you are from as the issues covered are universally human.  We have here a look at the new encroaching upon the old ways and how people attempt to make sense of and to adapt to these changes.  We see great love of a parent for a child and to what lengths this love will manifest itself in the way of self-sacrifice.  This Criterion release is pretty decent although in terms of picture and sound quality doesn't measure up as well as its ""Tokyo Story"" release as some obvious visual imperfections are present but thankfully not too many to ruin the viewing experience.  I guess Criterion has taken the standard so high when it comes to restoration of classics that I have come to expect a very high level of quality.  Still if you don't already have this and if you are a fan of great films this and ""Tokyo Story"" should be in your video library.

8112186,5,B000EOTWIS,"Sets'ko Hara's first film with Ozu, in her first of three 'Noriko' roles.  Ozu famously repudiated plot, pointing out that it abuses characterisation; and the events of Late Spring can be told in half a sentence: a daughter is reluctant to marry and leave her widowed father, so that her aunt suggests to the hesitant father that he pretend to be about to re-marry.  The daughter marries, the father, played to perfection by the great Chishu Ryu, is alone.

But this doesn't convey the depth of feeling, and the profound revelation of human connections and ultimate loneliness of living.  After the daughter is engaged - we never see her prospective partner - the father & daughter take a final trip from their home city of Kamakura to visit Kyoto.  As the visit ends, just they are packing, the daughter tells her father that she doesn't want to marry, that she is happiest living with him.  In response though he tells her she must leave him, that this is ""the pattern of the circle of human life""; and that she will make a new happiness with her partner.

After having seen and loving Tokyo Story, a film which is widely considered to be not only master Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozus best film, but also one of the greatest films ever made, I was very eager to see more. Many consider Late Spring another of his absolute best works so it seemed like a logical next choice, and I can happily say that it most definitely met my very high expectations. As with Tokyo Story, this a deep, masterfully-executed and penetrating film examining family life in Japan and the societal and generational pressures which shape and mold it, for better or for worse.

As with Tokyo Story, we enter this tale of father, Shukichi Somiya, and daughter, Noriko Somiya, in the middle. 27-year-old Noriko lives together with her father and they appear to be very close. Naturally, questions begin to arise in the mind of the viewer: where is Norikos mother and why hasn't she ever married? Ozu does a fantastic job of coaxing these questions out in the films early stages and gives us hints at what has transpired, but never spoon-feeds us by explicitly explaining the backstory. We learn that Noriko had been seriously ill at one point during a period of war and hardship, but has since recovered. Her mother is a mystery for much of the film, but it slowly becomes clear that she has died and that Shukichi is a widower. With this context, the film examines the father-daughter relationship between Noriko and Shukichi and the pressures on them both to have Noriko finally marry and leave the nest, so to speak.

The strength of this film (and Tokyo Story alike) is how subtly and effectively it tells this story. The screenplay and pacing of the film are phenomenal in slowly and carefully peeling back the layers of the family dynamic. Throughout the film we question the actions and underlying motivations of each of the characters. By the end, the full vision snaps into focus and we are left with a melancholy ending that really sneaks up and packs quite an emotional punch.

Lets begin with Noriko. For the length of the movie she is adamantly against marriage, especially re-marriage. As the details of the backstory filter in, her reasoning begins to become clear. Noriko lost her mother which has obviously affected her very much. As a result, she is very close with her father and wary of leaving him behind. Her mothers death obviously must have been very hard for her father as well, and she references the fact that he needs her to take care of him. She feels that she must be there for him because she fears he may be lonely if she leaves and won't be able to cope as a widower. She is also understandably protective of her father  she is afraid to lose him like she did her mother. Thus, she cant bear the thought of him ever remarrying which, in her mind, could potentially jeopardize their relationship. As the film progresses though, pressures on Noriko to get married come from all sides  her aunt, father, and best friend (and ironically, divorce) all urging her that she must take this long overdue and necessary step. To her, the relationship she has with her father is more than enough and brings her contentment. However, she is made to feel like she is being selfish in staying home with him, especially when it is suggested that he wishes to remarry. Thus, she eventually gives into these pressures and marries at the end of the film, but is clearly devastated and unhappy with her choice.

Shukichi can be analyzed in the same way. He seems to be very happy with his daughter home and with the lives they are leading together. It isn't until his sister, Masa, makes the observation that Noriko has gone far too long without marrying, that he begins to question things. He too begins to pressure Noriko that she must marry, and begins to insinuate that he wishes to remarry as well and that she need not worry about taking care of him. Many conversations seem to have taken place between Shukichi and Masa off-screen, as at the end of the movie it is revealed that Shukichis plans for remarriage were fabricated by both he and Masa in order to influence Noriko in her decision. Shukuchi feigns happiness at Norikos wedding (as does Noriko quite poorly), but at the end of the film we see him return home to his empty house in a devastating scene where his true distress becomes apparent.

In this moment, the movie strikes a powerful note as we realize neither Noriko nor Shukichi wanted for this marriage to happen and neither are happy with the outcome. They were both made to feel selfish by others around them  Shukichi for keeping Noriko home so long with him and Noriko for keeping her father from remarrying. In reality, neither of these two things are true, but the characters are made to believe them through the pressures of their family and friends. Now, they find themselves in places that neither of them wanted or needed, but that society has deemed correct for them.

Its a poignant and thoughtful tale which is marvelously achieved by the strength of spectacular direction and acting. Setsuko Hara is absolutely radiant and Noriko. She shines in every single scene and has such an effortless quality to her acting that makes her every move feel completely natural. There is quite a lot of subtlety to her performance as well, as Noriko constantly hides her true feelings behind a big smile and a pleasant demeanor. This subtlety and depth of performance extends to Chish Ry as Shukichi as well, who is equally brilliant as a caring father who is conflicted between keeping his daughter by his side and shooing her out the door to a more socially acceptable life.

And everything of course is tied together by Ozus absolutely masterful direction. He is able to frame his characters in such a respectful and gentle way that is never judgmental. And although this is a relatively sad story, it never feels like a condemnation of Japanese family values. Ozus strength is that he is able to simply present the story as it is, asserting that such is the nature of life and the pressures we all face. He doesnt blame his characters or anyone else for the way things play out, he just ruminates on the existence of these family dynamics and their effect on the lives we lead. The end result is a powerful film that is deep, thought-provoking, and emotionally resonant.",1461542400,3,6361,4.701077199281867
