8533373,5,B0090OPC46,"This video was an excellent introduction to the music of JC. More knowledgeable viewers might prefer more information on his compositions
but you can only do so much in the limited time on video. There was also a brief comment from Wolfgang Rihm. I learned quite a bit from
this video. The most surprising thing for me to learn was the Cage wrote music for dance.

Although the life of Cage depicted in the video was interesting, for me the real treasure of this is in the bonus features. There is a performance of the Second Construction by the  Schlagquartett Kln in front of a live audience. There are live performances of
other works also. Don't be without this video if you have any interest in Cages music.",1437609600,,712,4.5546875
8533374,5,B0090OPC46,"Thia is a thoughtful, fascinating documentary that can be enjoyed whether you love or dislike Cage's music. Highly recommended.",1425859200,2,127,5.7368421052631575
8533375,5,B0090OPC46,"An excellent tribute to John Cage featuring several beautifully filmed performances along with clips of Cage discussing his music.  This film makes use of some interview footage that is also seen in the documentary, ""I Have Nothing to Say and I Am Saying It"", which is perhaps a better overall introduction to Cage, but this film is far superior in terms of the musical performances and detailed explanations of the prepared piano and chance operations.",1397606400,5,453,5.04
