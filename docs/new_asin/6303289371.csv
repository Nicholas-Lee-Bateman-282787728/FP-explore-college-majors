7842744,5,6303289371,"I like this form. I don't know very much about Bob Klein, but I remember his name from ""Inside Kungfu"" magazines in the '80s and '90s as a highly regarded teacher of tai chi. We have a few saber forms in Hsing-I, but these movements are different for me. It's fun. Thank you, Bob.",1452384000,,280,4.203703703703703
7842745,5,6303289371,"This is a beautiful, dynamic form, with lots of leaps and intricate techniques.  It is the type that would be a favorite at tournaments.  The form is shown outdoors, from a few angles, sometimes at fast speed,  sometimes slowly, with frequent stops so you can check your own position  against the tape.  Then there is another section in which the teacher  explains each movement, tips on how to get the body to move fluidly and  connect all movements to the hips so you have whole body movement.  It is  explained well.  I think anyone could easily learn this form from the tape.  I have learned the basics and can tell you that it's great fun and great  exercise.",963532800,,664,4.533898305084746
7842746,5,6303289371,"This form is very explosive, using a lot of internal energy, with high energy leaps and ""flowers"" (spinning movements).  It mixes fluid movements with abrupt movements.  The form is shown from two different  angles, both at regular and slow speed and step by step.  In addition, each  movement is explained carefully, especially the body mechanics, and the  self defense applications are demonstrated.  This is a very enjoyable and  invigorating form.  Note:  Don't try this form with low ceilings or with  anything breakable near you.",956016000,,535,5.25
