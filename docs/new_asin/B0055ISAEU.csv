8458432,5,B0055ISAEU,"This documentary is in German but has English subtitles.  It covers Schumann's entire life, often quoting from his letters and diaries as well as those of friends and colleagues.  The film is interspersed with films of Schumann's music being performed by distinguished artists, such as Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Phil., as well as Adreas Schiff, Hermann Prey, Daniel Barenboim, etc.  The production value is high and it seems a serious scholarly attempt at examining Schumann's life and work. I would think that this film would be enjoyed by any fan of Schumann's music.  Recommended!",1347753600,9,590,5.178947368421053
