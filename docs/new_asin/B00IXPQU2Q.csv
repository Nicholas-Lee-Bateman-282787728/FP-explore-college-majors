6304279,5,B00IXPQU2Q,"Great DVD. This DVD along with the "" I Walk Alone"" DVD have about 98% of his greatest matches. Its a good DVD on one of my all time favorite superstars.
In the DVD Batista said the real reason why he left WWE was that he didn't like the PG format. I know this is a spoiler but its just nice to see that one of my favorite superstars has the same opinion about the way the direction of the company has gone as I do.",1404000000,,414,3.8255813953488373
6304280,3,B00IXPQU2Q,"He was one of the biggest superstars in WWE history since the Attitude Era & dominated WWE for close to 5 years but decided to leave in order to pursue other personal interest only to return to WWE to a heavily mixed reaction from the fans & critics so here's a chronicle of where he's been, where he is physically & mentally, and where he's going in ""Batista: The Animal Unleashed.""  Outside of his surgeon & a few of his MMA partners, you only hear from Batista throughout this presentation which is very similar to Jeff Hardy & Randy Orton's previous documentaries where it follows Batista around & gets a behind the scenes look which in this case was his return to WWE on RAW & later in the month at the Royal Rumble.

The documentary start off with a brief rundown of his life & career up to this point before Batista discusses who he feels is his biggest critic & how he wasn't 100% healthy coming back before he went into details about what he witness first hand what was the same & different since he was around 4 years ago.  Batista then reflects on why the Royal Rumble event itself has always been very special to him before going into why he decided to leave WWE & the effect his last match had on him for the next year.  One of the highlights of the documentary came next with his venture into mixed martial arts is discussed as far what what attracted him to the sport & discussing why he had only one MMA fight before going into his love of low-rider cars including what he did as a tribute to Eddie Guerrero.  Batista discusses his acting career briefly before going behind the scenes at the Rumble that resembles the phrase ""everything that could go wrong did go wrong"" followed by his feelings on the fans reaction to his return along with closing the documentary on his future plans.

Matches Include:
Leviathan vs. Brock Lesnar - You got exactly what you expected from the start with both men having similar strong body builds in that they were heavily evenly matches through stalemates in the early lockup or trading power moves from various suplexes & slams to a spinebuster to a clothesline that stopped the other man dead in his tracks along with showcasing some agility like a springboard crossbody out of the corner.  Both men were in their developmental stages of their career but definitely a showcase of the potential they had at that time.
""Ohio Valley Wrestling"" July '01

W/Reverend D-Von vs. Faarooq & Randy Orton - This wasn't much showcasing past the veterans carrying the match while Orton in the early stages of his WWE career took more high risk athletic offense coming off the top rope various times & Batista showcase his powerful offense including one move that turned another man inside out but it's ironic of seeing where Orton & Batista were as opponents compared to the position they would be in under a year later as allies.
""SmackDown!"" June '02

w/Ric Flair (Evolution) vs. World Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam & Booker T - Evolution leader Triple H was traded to SmackDown earlier in the night as part of the first ever WWE Draft which resulted in Evolution being heavily off their game with Booker & RVD taking advantage of it in the first half of the match before before Evolution resorted to dirty tactics both inside & outside of the ring along with taking advantage of the referee to regain the advantage as they traded back & forth to the point where it took one team taking advantage of miscommunication between their opponents.
""RAW"" Mar. '04

World Championship/Bullrope Match vs. J.B.L. - This was J.B.L.'s final opportunity at the World Championship in the same match that he originally won the WWE Championship in over a year earlier with the stipulation that the first man to touch all four corners in order without the momentum being broken would be declared the winner.  Both men had the opportunity to go for the corners multiple times using the bullrope in various ways such as wrapping it around their opponents' neck to drag them while also countering it in the same ways such as a clothesline while bullrope was used as a weapon from the cowbell itself to being whipped across the body.  This type of match with these type of stipulations always limit what your able to do but these two did make the best of it.
""SmackDown!"" Sept. '05

W/Rey Mysterio & Bobby Lashley vs. King Booker, Finlay, Mark Henry - This was Batista's first match back from his injury earlier in the year in a match that didn't go long but told a story for everyone involved from Finlay's ""little helper"" to Mysterio continuing to be an ""underdog"" World Champion but the biggest story coming out of this match was Mark Henry being injured within seconds that caused the storyline of Batista looking for revenge against him to be dropped.
""Saturday Nights Main Event"" July '06

World Championship Match vs. King Booker vs. Finlay - This was shortly after Batista regained the World Championship at Survivor Series with King Booker & Queen Sharmell showing signs of being more serious than they usually are as Batista was the odd man out between both men so he worked over both men & was able to use one against the other before it became every man for himself with each man in control using the same strategy at one point to keep one man inside the ring & the other opponent on the outside with two men at one point trying to form a team to take out the biggest threat only for one man to trying to steal the pin & both men breaking up the other's pin attempt.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. '06
[Batista: I Walk Alone]

vs. Kane vs. Finlay vs. Mark Henry - This was a #1 Contender Match with World Champion Edge sitting at ringside on commentary with his big mouth resulting on one man getting his hands on him at one point as this match started off & continued as two separate matches in one with each man paring off with another both inside & outside the ring during the first half of the match before all four men eventually got back into the ring together trying to take each other out with one big move after another.
""SmackDown!"" May '07

vs. Edge - This was a non-title match due to Batista no longer eligible for a World Title match against Edge after Night Of Champions earlier in the week as Edge kept going to the ropes to avoid him & trying the same various tactics he used earlier in the week to either get an easy win or just get out of the match no avail before eventually being able to work over the neck & head area as Batista easily overpowered Edge with power moves along with submissions such as stretching Edge's leg over his own head on the mat as both men traded momentum catching & countering each other's offense at certain points.  Edge & Batista have that chemistry where I can say they rarely have a bad match against each other with this being no exception but definitely different in the fact that with the World Title no longer an issue between both men, Batista showed that he was out to hurt & punish Edge more than just win a match.
""SmackDown!"" June '07

Last Man Standing Match vs. Kane - This was a non-title match as Batista was already set to face Edge & Kane's brother Undertaker at Armageddon that weekend as both men showcased their evenly matched strength with big power moves from various slams in & out of the ring to a spinebuster & chokeslam while also being able to either avoid & counter signature offense of their opponent or catch their opponent into a big trademark maneuver as the action picked up on the outside of the ring with elements of the ringside environment being used as weapons including one man being knocked into the crowd while the other was slammed onto the announce table that didn't give.  A strong performance by both men.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. '07

Stretcher Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Batista was looking for revenge for not only Shawn costing his mentor Ric Flair his career at WrestleMania but also lying & deceiving him to win their previous match months earlier at Backlash as Batista overpowered Shawn including using the stretcher to his advantage on more than one occasion before Shawn was able to come back focusing on the head using whatever he could on the outside from the stretcher itself to steel steps & ring post while also trying to choke him out as Batista focused on Shawn's back heavily beating on it in & outside of the ring to the point where you could see it was hurting Shawn to execute his own offense as it came down to one man being the other down until he had nothing left to give while a third party got involved trying to motivate him to continue as this match all came down to one phrase, ""I'm not sorry & I don't love you!""  A very physical encounter.
One Night Stand '08

vs. World Champion C.M. Punk - Punk cashed in the Money In The Bank briefcase to win the World Championship weeks earlier after Batista had already beaten down Edge leading to this match here where Batista showed he had the superior strength early shoving Punk back & even knocking him down various times with a strong elbow & kick to the face only for Punk to come back with various kicks of his own that knocked Batista down & later out of the ring as both men traded momentum with Batista heavily focusing on the back using his strikes & power moves along with submissions like the camel clutch while Punk kept relying on his strong kicks & his speed including going aerial on more than one occasion.  I didn't expect Batista's style of wrestling to clash well with Punk's but it did & put on quite the performance here.
Great American Bash '08

Special Referee - Steve Austin: vs. World Champion Chris Jericho - Stone Cold was voted as the special guest referee over Shawn Michaels & Randy Orton with Jericho complaining that it was a conspiracy against him to the point where he attempted to walk out of the match only for Austin to rules that he could lose the championship on a count out or disqualification as Batista took advantage of Jericho being frustrated easily overpowering him at a fast pace before Jericho was able to use that momentum against him & slowed down the pace heavily working over his knee to the point where it effected Batista when executing his offense while staying one step ahead counting his offense whenever possible before people who had an agenda against one of the opponents decided to make their presence known.
Cyber Sunday '08

w/Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho & J.B.L. - Shawn was jumped backstage before the match causing Batista to take on both men alone which he was able to do early on before both men had to resort to illegal tactics such as double teaming & the illegal man getting involved in the action as well as Batista kept attempting to use his power & gain advantage catching one man only for the numbers game to keep catching up to him.
""RAW"" Oct. '08

W/Shane McMahon vs. Cody Rhodes & Ted DiBiase - This was a preview for the upcoming six man tag at Backlash as Shane & Batista were working well together as a team with their double team offense including a move that was a throwback to the days of Demolition while Legacy focused on using double teaming themselves while attempting to keep one man grounded & away from his partner in what was a solid tag match that served as a preview for their six man tag match at Backlash but also continued to push that factor of possible trust issues between one team.
""SmackDown!"" Apr. '09

Steel Cage Match vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton - For those who didn't already know, Batista had already re-injured himself (after being back for around 2 months) going into this match so it was kept short because of that but this turned out to be their best PPV match because it had the high impact & intensity that their previous matches were lacking in a dominate performance by Batista that resulted in the first ever time the WWE Championship changed hands in a regular steel cage match (Elimination Chamber & Hell In A Cell doesn't count).
Extreme Rules '09

vs. C.M. Punk - A rematch from their previous World Championship match over a year earlier as Punk attempted the same strategy using his strong kicks only for Batista to have them more scouted this time blocking & countering his attempts causing Punk to keep going to the outside to break his momentum before taking advantage of catching him in the ropes grounding Batista to take away his power advantage while working over the head & neck area before Batista was able to overpower Punk on various occasions either catching him or simply overpowering him.
""SmackDown!"" Oct. '09

vs. Rey Mysterio - It should be noted that Batista came into this match as a heel for the first time since his Evolution days but was cheered with this PPV being held in his hometown as Mysterio tried to use his speed here including trying an old Eddie Guerrero move that the crowd booed but kept getting caught by Batista who used his power to inflict punishment & just punish Mysterio throughout the match to the point where it had to be stopped. This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as it heavily established the new Batista as he was more focused on embarrassing & hurting Mysterio than just getting a win.
Survivor Series '09

Street Fight Match vs. Rey Mysterio - After Batista destroyed Mysterio at the previous S. Series PPV, he tried to use the hit & run offense here but Batista caught him with an impactful clothesline followed by powerful whip into the corner but Rey kept resorting to this speed trying to play the game of ""cat & mouse"" with it working against Batista at times only for him to use his power to stop his momentum dead in it's tracks & doing such things was whipping Mysterio with the television cables. Mysterio refused to quit & was even able to use a chair a few times but Batista still was an unstoppable force. This match did it's job in establishing Rey was the little man who won't give up against the unstoppable ""animal"" but outside of the chair being used in the end, this was more of a normal match than an actual street fight.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. '09
[Falls Count Anywhere]

vs. Sheamus vs. Randy Orton - This was originally scheduled to be a singles match between Sheamus & Orton before Batista staked his claim with WWE Champion John Cena declaring this a triple threat match to see who he faces at Over The Limit.  Batista played it smart at first staying on the outside allowing the other two to work over each other only to pick the bones whenever opportunity strikes as this match broke down into three separate singles matches throughout the one match as the same strategy of ""divide & conquer"" was implemented where two men would keep one opponent on the outside of the ring before concentrating on each other as there were a few times where all three men were interacting with each other as it ultimately came down to one man being able to capitalize on one man taking the opportunity to make a statement of his own.
""RAW"" Apr. '10

I Quit Match vs. WWE Champion John Cena - Their final encounter that started out with Batista dominating the opening moments including applying a new submission hold onto Cena before he was able to counter it into the STF that knocked Batista out. As a deja-vu moment from what Randy Orton did to Cena in their last ""I Quit"" against Orton, Cena then got some liquid to revive Batista since he can't quit if he's knocked out. Batista was able to get control again on the outside using moves like the running powerslam through the table before fighting through the crowd & attempting to Batista-bomb Cena off a stairway. They continued to fight to the stage area where Batista tried to run Cena over with a car before Cena recovered with an FU on the car. The only weak part of this match for me was the ending as it reminded me of the ""I Quit"" match against J.B.L. where J.B.L. quit out of fear of what's going to happen next & not out of being beaten into a submission.
Over The Limit '10

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - This is joined in progress after Batista entered at #28 with various moments including who really believed in The Shield?, a new record broken after over a decade, the crowds response to one man being excluded from the match, the reaction that couldn't be denied at the end no matter how high they tried to drown it out with theme music and as of right now what looks like to be the final performance of one of the biggest stars in recent years.
Royal Rumble '14

vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was one of those matches that will be remembered for what happened outside the match than during it as Batista was on the defense for a majority of the contest after Del Rio cheated to get an advantage & ruthlessly attacked his arm non-stop throughout the entire match using whatever he could use with Batista getting an occasional move in before he was able to take advantage of a mistiming but the story here was the crowd showing their disapproval for ""Boo-tista"" to the point where they cheered Del Rio along with other current & former superstars in what was a poor showing for a man who's suppose to head into the championship title match at the biggest show of the year. I would check out their rematch the next night on RAW as that was a better encounter.
Elimination Chamber '14

(Blu-Ray) vs. Justin Credible - This was his RAW debut in a match that lasted under a minute with Batista dominating with his power from start to finish.
""RAW"" Nov. '02

(Blu-Ray) vs. Kane - Ric Flair had a verbal confrontation with Kane allowing Batista to attack from behind using his power to work over Kane only for him to keep getting back up using some power offense of his own to not only take out Batista but anyone else who got in the way in a quick but solid match that's significant for the beginning of the alliance between Flair & Batista.
""RAW"" Nov. '02

(Blu-Ray) vs. World Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz - The Dudleys had already defeated all of their scheduled opponents in the team team turmoil gauntlet match before Eric Bischoff announced Evolution as the final team who took advantage of the Dudleys already being beaten down & exhausted to have this last under a minute.
Armageddon '03

(Blu-Ray) vs. Randy Orton - This took place the night after WrestleMania 21 were Batista won the World Championship from Triple H while was their first meeting against each other since both men left Evolution as the match didn't last long due to Orton coming into the match with an injured shoulder which Batista heavily targeted throughout the match both in & outside of the ring.
""RAW"" Apr. '05

(Blu-Ray) w/Eddie Guerrero vs. MNM - This was scheduled to be a tag match but Eddie came down with a sickness only to be ""examined"" by Batista's personal doctor before the match causing Eddie to be on the outside of the ring throughout the match in pain as Batista took on & dominated both men resulting in Melina causing a distraction on more than one occasion for her team to keep gaining back control before Eddie was able to make a recovery at the right time for his ""partner.""
""SmackDown!"" Sept. '05

(Blu-Ray) World Championship/Punjabi Prison Match vs. Great Khali - This was the second (and to date, the last) Punjabi Prison Match in WWE history as it's structure is a bamboo cage surrounding the ring followed by another & bigger cage made of bamboo surrounding the ringside area (similar to how the Kennel From Hell was a normal steel cage surrounded by Hell In A Cell) with the inside cage having four small access doors where when called on to be open only has 60 seconds for someone to escape them before the door is locked throughout the remainder of the match with the object of the match being the first to escape both cages & drop the arena floor.  It's no secret that Khali is extremely limited in what he's able to do past chops & kicks so Batista had to work around that such as the classic ""Andre"" spot getting caught in the ropes with the elements of the cage coming into play such as a leather strap & the cage door being used as a weapon.  As I said earlier that Khali is heavily limited in what he can do so this type of match with the various stipulations actually helped this match more than hurt it in this case.
No Mercy '07

(Blu-Ray) vs. WWE Champion vs. John Cena - John Cena had just successfully regained the WWE Championship in the Elimination Chamber match only for Mr. McMahon to appear & announce that he had to defend the championship against Batista right afterwords in what was pretty much a dominate complete squash against an already weaken Cena.
Elimination Chamber '10
[Satan's Prision: The Elimination Chamber Anthology]

The documentary itself was disappointing because it lasted around 40 minutes & didn't dive as deep into various subjects as I would like coming off like a special that we would see on the WWE Network instead of a DVD quality presentation as it came off more like a shoot interview mixed with footage of his lifestyle from the past few months.  The match selection was a mixed bag as a majority of his high profile performances were on his previous DVD set allowing room for the more rare matches which in some cases were just showcasing a specific time in his career (tag match as Deacon Batista or his in-ring return during the six man tag) while others were high quality & important matches that occurred after or missed on the first DVD set as Batista competed on SmackDown during a time where they were having main event quality matches on free TV but some of the more non-relevant unimportant fillers could have been replaced in favor of other matches (three matches against Undertaker including their steel cage match & chairs match or the forgotten No Disqualification Match from SmackDown, his tag team matches with John Cena including their World Tag Team Title win, the WrestleMania rematch against Triple H from Backlash, and the six man tag with Eddie Guerrero & Roddy Piper come to mind right away).  In the end, the documentary wasn't much past catching up on Batista's life from when he left to his comeback at the Rumble while the match selection was a mixed bag but overall enjoyable so I would only recommend this set for hardcore fans of Batista because the average or casual fan would be disappointed.",1403136000,2,22226,4.547773886943472

6304282,4,B00IXPQU2Q,"I just found out about this DVD and I thought that was going to be a nice documentary, I'm glad that I rented it for only $3.99 instead of buying it for $20.00, but all-in-all it was a good 39 minutes of pure Batista.",1403049600,,217,3.9545454545454546
6304283,2,B00IXPQU2Q,"When I heard about this DVD I'm expecting something like at least a 2 hour segment where Batista talks about crucial moments in his career the big decisions he had to make, the injuries, him leaving, his thoughts on other wrestlers and the company....and instead we got a 35 minute documentary where he barely comments on a few key events, that's on DVD 1.

The other 3 DVDs are compilations of matches he had. I wasn't looking for a DVD on his matches (granted a lot of them were in fact great)  but I wanted more about Batista, his life!

I felt pretty cheated to be honest, for I REALLY like Dave Batista, and it felt really bad to see him return only to be booed by fans. Thing is, like he said on the DVD when he came back, he didn't know any of the new writers WWE had on the board, so it's not his fault matches were the way they were.

Overall....unless you really want to watch his key matches, it's just not worth it in my humble opinion. Hopefully the Paul Heyman DVD that's coming out will be better (at least he doesn't have any fights to use as a DVD Filler)",1402704000,9,1072,4.189320388349515

6304285,5,B00IXPQU2Q,"The Animal, Batista, was one of the most dominant Superstars of the 21st century, until his abrupt departure from WWE in 2010. Now, the former WWE and World Heavyweight Champion is back to reclaim his place at the top of the food chain. In this release, fans follow his path from the struggles that drove him away from WWE to his triumphant return in 2014.

Why did he leave? What conquests did he pursue while he was away? How did he train? And how does he plan to conquer WWE all over again?

The 39 minutes go very fast and I was very surprised when the end credit popped up.

The only real reason to get this video are the matches. There's 22 matches, most of them from Raw and Smackdown episodes so they won't be found on WWE Network. Also has a few good ppv matches and there aren't many repeats.

Not bad, but try to get this DVD cheap.",1404172800,6,628,4.358974358974359
