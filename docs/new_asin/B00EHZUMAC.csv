5915038,5,B00EHZUMAC,"I'm only a recent DTP convert and have to say that this is the maddest live performance I've ever seen, and I mean that in a good way.

It goes from the beautiful vocals of both Devin and  Anneke Van Giersbergen to some hardcore/thrast style songs - from songs like Ih-Ah to Detox to and everything in between, but it's not like they're trying to cover these breadths on purpose, it actually flows.

Awesome musicianship all the way through. Bend it Like Bender is a riot - like a massive party on stage but the party-goers are the performers.  As others have said, the finale on the couches is pretty cool as well.",1390694400,,615,4.415929203539823
5915039,5,B00EHZUMAC,This is something you won't see anywhere else. It embodies everything Devin Townsend has worked towards. Its a blast and a must have for any Devin Townsend fan.,1386720000,,160,4.75
5915040,2,B00EHZUMAC,"Great concert, excellent picture, very poor audio. Devin Townsend's voice can barely be heard in the rock tracks. Only stereo option available. Big shame because the concert is a beauty.",1386201600,,186,5.233333333333333
5915041,5,B00EHZUMAC,"I can't tell the world how much I love Devin Townsend and this Retinal Circus bluray.  The guy just makes some of the best music many of you have never heard.  Everyone should do themselves a favour and pick up one of his ""Project""/DTP albums.  I'd recommend Addicted or Epicloud if you are just hearing him for the first time.  But anyway, back to the Retinal Circus... it's insane, bizarre, crazy, fun, a few WTF moments all set to Devin's music spannig over his career.  I've watched the whole thing from start to finish more times in a month than any other concert I have ever bought on DVD/Bluray.

I never heard any of the Strapping Young Lad stuff before seeing this show.  First listen to Deotx and Love and I was onboard.  That's how metal is done.  Hang on to your hats!

Anneke van Giersbergen singling along with Devin, simply beautiful.

The finale, couldn't wipe the smile off my face.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!  More please DTP!!!

5 out of 5 easily.",1383782400,4,969,4.558139534883721
5915042,5,B00EHZUMAC,"Devin Townsend was thinking about this project for years, and it finally came true in 2012, here he can have for prosperity his Broadway musical ""The Retinal Circus"". This theatrical production has a story that was supposed to illustrate his 20 years career. How the artist can put in a story the music of different parts of his career when every album has his own story? We can think that the story is secondary compare to the music. He wanted to give some entertaining value to the music that is already pleasant to hear. So we got a big production here with costumes, plenty of characters, visual objects, a choir. The musicians had the task to keep their focus on their music while there were a lot of things going on in the stage. Steve Vai, a long time friend of Devin is doing the narration between songs to explain the story of the evolution of man through the mind of Mr. Townsend, which include the invasion of aliens.

The music is intense as usual with 3 different kinds of songs: the complex prog songs, the quiet and dark ones, and the heavy ones; 2 Strapping Young Lads songs, with the original guitar player, Jed Simon. The vocals of Anneke Van Giersbergen are well worth the price of admission here by giving more melodic feel to the music. You can here and see the results of this in the simple song ""Ih-Ah!"". The set list is well crafted with a balance set of songs of different moods and you never get bored during this 2 hours and forty minutes show.

The final scene is really special with the recreation of a living room where every band members pass through a door and gets a rest while Devin sings his little acoustic piece ""Little Pig"". It's impressive to know that this big production was done on low budget and that the man is still sticking to his ideas despite the lack of funds. I hope this efforts serve him in the future and help the band to have more recognition because, the man has a lot of others ideas to bring to the world of the experimental metal scene, and need plenty of money if he want to do others big productions! I have to give 5 stars here, because it's the first time we can see a document of that nature and that proportion in the metal world.",1381622400,7,2194,4.375
5915043,5,B00EHZUMAC,"Seriously, this man is one hell of an entertainer. Any of his live shows are top notch (I've been to 6 of them), but this one he especially went all out. It plays out like a musical of sorts and spans music from his whole well rounded career (including two Strapping Young Lad songs!). There are plenty of great musical guests that make appearances and the stage set up and extras are very enjoyable!

Sound quality is good. Devin tends to have a wall of sound approach for his mastering so expect the mix to be heavy and booming. A good sound system is a must as a lesser stereo system or TV speaker will likely be underpowered for the response. The show is in two parts and there is a comprehensive documentary on the making of the whole thing.

Definitely a show you'll want to watch over and over. It's also quite nice to play in the background if you're doing something. Please support an absolutely wonderful musician!",1415923200,,924,4.461538461538462

5915048,5,B00EHZUMAC,"I was concerned this would not work in the US due to Blu-ray regional codes. It works, and the content is playable. I don't know exactly what to expect from the sound, but I can say it was not as impressive as some excellently crafted Blu-ray movie sounds. That is a shame, because Hevy Devy knows sound like no other.",1400284800,,318,4.316666666666666
5915049,5,B00EHZUMAC,Not enough artists of this quality putting out excellent music live and studio. Highly recommended. Too bad Live - by a Thread isn't more easily available...,1395878400,,157,5.076923076923077
5915050,2,B00EHZUMAC,I love DTP but...Poor sound quality. They need to remix this amazing show! Very disappointed not to hear what I'm seeing.,1395100800,,121,4.809523809523809

5915052,4,B00EHZUMAC,"This is one strange video to experience.  I love Devy and his work.  His music is amazing and has a depth sonically that is hard to match.  I find myself hearing new things in his music all the time.  And the songs are masterfully performed on this video.

But I cannot give it five stars.  The stage show is presented as it was live and it's just... odd.  It somewhat detracts from the performances and the music.  I realize that's what Devin was trying to accomplish and it was definitely accomplished, I just don't like it as much as I'd hoped.  I'm sure not sorry I bought it, but I think the ""Live By A Thread"" boxed set is more representative of what I love about Dev and his work.",1393977600,,687,4.223076923076923

8605398,5,B00EHZUMAC,"Having been a Devin Townsend fan for many years, I've always wanted him to be able to capture the energy of his records and in his live shows onto some kind of live release. Well, technology has finally caught up to Mr. Townsend's vision. This Blu-ray is astonishing. I don't say these words lightly - it is the greatest concert video I have in my collection, and I have a lot. I know this because there is no other concert video I play more than this one. It's been a few years since it was originally released, and it still sits there, next to my player, ready for whenever I need a dose of War, True North, Grace, Detox, or whatever else.

The production of the audio on this disc is fantastic. Devin did a really terrific job. It really captures the energy of his studio albums. He somehow manages to put everything up front but not to the detriment of the individual players. The picture quality is also great. The editing, while quick, is not too quick. But the real magic is in the performances. They did a great job trying as best they could to organize Devin's 20 year musical catalog into some form of a loose story, complete with actors, dancers, choirs and comedy. While not completely cohesive, it gives him an excuse to go deep into his history while creating many spectacular stage moments along the way.

The opening combination of Effervescent! and True North gives me goosebumps almost every time I watch it. This mostly has to do with the absolute brilliant use of Anneke Van Giersbergen. She is pivotal in this production and I cannot say enough good things about her. Her vocals add a layer to Devin's music (both the songs she originally appears on and those she guests on for the first time here) that cannot be understated. Her work with Devin (and over the years with Arjen Lucassen) has made her indispensable. I wish I had the opportunity to see her and Devin perform together.

Similar goosebump moments occur throughout the 150 minute (!!) set.  It is an absolute blast.  Devin's setlist selections also make this more of a party than other concerts he's done. Since Anneke is there, he does quite a few tracks from their Addicted! and Epicloud albums, which have a bit more upbeat, poppy feel than other records of his.  While I miss songs from his Terria album dearly on this set, I'm not sure they would fit well with the overall energy of the night.

If you are new to Devin and are thinking about where to start, or are a big fan and wondering if you really need to buy a live concert video from an artist that you own most of the studio albums for already, I would urge you to buy this without hesitation. You will not be disappointed.  It is the greatest concert video I have ever seen.",1512172800,,2722,4.473790322580645
8605399,5,B00EHZUMAC,This won't come as any surprise to fans of Devin but this was a fantastic show! Strongly recommended,1506384000,,100,4.611111111111111
8605400,4,B00EHZUMAC,"This is a great concert. The stage show is kinda cheesy, but i reckon that's what he was going for. My only complaint is no 5.1. it's lpcm stereo so that's better than dd, but i think 5.1 is the standard and essential for 5 stars in a bluray concert.",1489968000,,250,4.02
8605401,5,B00EHZUMAC,"We were looking for this blu-ray for a long time, we had seen just parts of the concert/show before, but it really exceed our expectations, we really enjoyed it. Devin Townsend is the best.",1447804800,,189,4.588235294117647
8605402,5,B00EHZUMAC,Absolutely love it. Great set for any big DTP fan.,1430265600,,50,4.1
8605403,5,B00EHZUMAC,"Devin Townsend for a long time was someone I'd heard OF but never actually HEARD.  I was much more familiar with him as a producer than as a musician.  A friend of mine told me to check out Devin's former band Strapping Young Lad.  I did, but I'm not a big fan of Cookie Monster vocals and told my friend as much.  Knowing my tastes in music, he perked.

""I am about to make you a Devin Townsend fangirl,"" he said.

He proceeded to pop ""The Retinal Circus"" into his DVD player and cued it up.  He literally said ""wait for it ... wait for it ..."" while Steve Vai did a monologue about religion.  ""Well ... seems inevitable ... guys, if this is what you feel you need to do, how about a good old fashioned--""

Devin screamed WAAAAARRRRRR and suddenly I was banging my head and throwing metal.

""War"" is the fifth song on ""The Retinal Circus,"" a mash-up of metal, Broadway, comedy, prog, I don't know what that is, seriously, what was THAT?  IS HE ACTUALLY DOING THAT?  It basically requires you to suspend all belief--and disbelief--about what's metal and what's not.  Devin, with the help of his incredibly tight backing band (guitarist Dave Young, bassist Brian Waddell, and drummer Ryan van Poederooyen) and one of my favorite singers of all time, Anneke van Giersbergen, runs the gamut between slow and lovely ballads to put-your-head-through-the-wall speed metal and throws in so many other elements it'll make your head spin.  ""The Retinal Circus"" is essentially a retrospective of Devin's career--Steve Vai shows up because Devin's first big exposure in music was singing on Vai's ""Sex & Religion"" album, and Strapping Young Lad guitarist Jed Simon shows up to do a couple of SYL songs.

The easiest way to characterize Devin's music is ""imagine if Frank Zappa played metal and had a sense of humor.""  I have never shown ""The Retinal Circus"" to anyone who didn't bust out laughing at least twice during it.  Devin is clearly enjoying the whole thing and definitely not afraid to make fun of everything and everyone, including himself.  In all seriousness, though, Devin Townsend is hands down the most talented metal musician ever.  He is an amazing singer, a flat-out fantastic guitarist, and the writer for some of the catchiest metal riffs ever.  I don't think you can quite convert a metal hater with ""The Retinal Circus,"" but you better believe you'll catch them banging their heads a time or two.",1428192000,2,2407,4.712918660287081
8605404,4,B00EHZUMAC,"The music is stellar, the stage production not so much.  Everybody was having fun though, and so did I.",1427673600,,103,4.421052631578948
8605405,5,B00EHZUMAC,"Absolute spectacle and a lot of fun, too. Devin Townsend is a man of great talent, and those talents are all on display here. Excellent supporting performers and musicians as well. Very well engineered and produced for a live performance",1426982400,,237,4.95
