6948763,5,B00S1VR6A2,"This DVD will teach your children about the Bible in an entertaining way.  The stories are factually presented based on the scripture.  Each story lasts from 40-50 minutes and highlights the main points you want your children to learn.  ""Bible Stories for Kids:  10 Animated Tales"" is an excellent tool to introduce children to the main characters of the Bible.  God bless each family who raises their children in a Christian home.",1431648000,26,431,4.930555555555555
6948764,2,B00S1VR6A2,Is  good for kids but cheap,1430956800,,27,3.5
6948765,4,B00S1VR6A2,Good stories but my grand daughter is 4 and they don't give enough back ground for a four year old. I think better for a 6 or 7 yr old and up.,1430611200,9,142,3.46875
6948766,5,B00S1VR6A2,A quality and precise depiction of God's word for children's minds to understand. My kids ask to watch these lessons now. Definetly for anyone who wants to teach the word of God to there kids.,1429747200,,192,4.514285714285714
6948767,5,B00S1VR6A2,These are great and my 6 and 9 year old love watching! Highly recommend!,1426896000,,72,4.214285714285714
6948768,5,B00S1VR6A2,"Perfect for those wanting to help bring wholesome values to their children's or grandchildren's upbringing. Teach a child the way they should go and they won't waver (as much) as an adult. Good stories without foul language, blood and gore or any horror images. These will not traumatize your child for life, like some movies made today.",1426723200,12,337,4.9298245614035086
6948779,2,B00S1VR6A2,"I've watched through part of Samson and Delilah...

So far, the narrator sings and is a horrible singer and the songs are not well thought out. At the very least, they should have used gospel hymns or songs! The narrator has a horrible speaking voice, too. Adults can look over these, but kids likely will not want to watch it. My niece and nephew have a lot to choose from, so this should be quality, too. They also mention God only as much as required and prayer is almost omitted after Abraham--which is the very first story. Even in reference to Abraham the importance of prayer is missing. Kids need the basics. Be warned; you will have to emphasize the basics to them while watching this, which a children Christian movie should do where appropriate. I would also prefer the artwork was average or better, because anything a bible film has going for it with kids would be a great thing(AS THEY CAN BE STUCK ON THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND NOT BUDGE FROM THAT). It is also too Caucasian and visually inaccurate, which can be commonplace with Christian films. They also occasionally stray from simple words. Based on that kids probably will not to watch it and you have work to do--if they even do decide to complete the discs--I give it a 2.4. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece and nephew, but I regret the purchase so far. I do plan to update my comment after watching all if my opinion changes...",1513036800,,1411,4.490272373540856
6948780,1,B00S1VR6A2,"This movie is definitely not child appropriate!! My oldest son picked up a lot of bad stuff from this movie! Inapropriate language, adult situations, killing/murder... It does not focus on the purpose of the title. The women are....very very adult!",1511308800,,248,5.225

6948784,5,B00S1VR6A2,"I love this DVD, brought if for a sunday school daycare, kids ages 3-12. The smaller kids didn't really watch it, but it kept the kids that are 7 and up pretty occupied. Each episode is pretty long and there's about 5 episodes each dvd. Killed a lot of times and very interesting. Not really recommended for smaller children, unless you have those kids that will watch anything lol I myself don't like musicals but I kinda enjoyed it! The stories are pretty accurate-good enough for young children. Overall good DVD!",1486598400,,516,4.681318681318682

I was very happy with this video purchase because my student's loved every episode.  They were very engaged in each episode segment.  I love how they were learning about bible stories while being entertained.  My principal was also very happy with the video and felt that it was a great supplemental activity for elementary classrooms in our school.",1466467200,15,457,4.973684210526316

6948817,4,B00S1VR6A2,Bought this DVD for our 50+ Bible Club kids to watch the Easter Story. I just previewed it. It is very Biblical. It's not action packed but I think will keep the kids attention as children are so video oriented today. I am thinking about buying a copy for each Bible Club family as an end of the year gift as our society is so needy spiritually. Children do not know who Jesus is or about salvation. Praying God uses these DVDs to reach families with the Gospel message.,1456444800,15,470,4.292134831460674
6948818,5,B00S1VR6A2,Good,1453248000,,4,4.0
6948829,2,B00S1VR6A2,More appropriate for a gradeschool child. Each story is a bit too long for preschoolers. Also think each story should be summarized a little better. Kids lose interest too quickly with the long lead-up in the plot.,1449014400,8,214,4.8108108108108105
