5627482,4,B00BJ3AQL0,"Set in pre-revolutionary Versaille, Oscar is the daughter of General Jarjayes, raised to be the son he never had.  She rises in the ranks to the elite Royal Guard and Marie Antoinette is under her protection.  This is complete with sparkles, bubbles, sword sounds (zing?), and lots and lots of pink.

My one complaint is that it is subbed only, not dubbed as noted in the copy ad.",1370908800,,380,4.5588235294117645
5627483,5,B00BJ3AQL0,"I've wanted to see this series for years and I'm so happy to finally see it make it to the US.  It's such a huge impact on shoujo anime and US fans could see its influences everywhere, but never got to see the original.  Even though I haven't purchased any anime for years, I pre-ordered this series as soon as I could.  Rose of Versailles in the US is something that should not be passed up.

I was expecting the show to be interesting from a sort of academic sense, but dated and a little painful to watch.  I was really surprised by how wrong I was and how truly excellent it is.  This is a show that is 100% shoujo, with lots of fancy dresses and sparkles, but it has great writing, interesting characters, and gorgeous animation.  This DVD release is very well done and the video quality is great.

This is subtitled only, no dub, which isn't a big deal for me as I don't watch dubbed anime anyway.  I'm just glad to see this classic of anime finally see a US release.

Thank you, Right Stuf!  I hope this release is financially successful because it is very much appreciated.  I will hold out hope that one day perhaps we will also see Oniisama e on DVD!",1368316800,16,1160,4.2465753424657535
5627484,4,B00BJ3AQL0,"Rose of Versailles was to female anime fans what Legend of the Galactic Heroes is to male anime fans - the title that they had despaired of ever reaching Region 1.  The anime world was rocked last September with the news that heck had frozen over and Rose of Versailles had actually been licensed.

When General de Jarjeyes, desperate for a male heir, learns that his wife has once again given birth to a girl, he has a virtual meltdown and insists that the girl be raised as a man since God has not given him a son.  His daughter Oscar matches all that could be expected of her to the point of even being appointed Commander of the Royal Guard.  With the help of her devoted de jure servant and de facto best friend Andre and her second in command Gerodere - whose respect she earned by discreetly beating him out for the position - she begins the assignment of protecting the new Dauphine, Marie Antoinette of Austria.

Antoinette, initially rather prudish, is shocked - I say shocked! - to learn that the widowed King Louis XV, Antoinette's Grandfather-in-Law, has a mistress, the murderess Countess du Barry, and a soap-operaish catfight ensues, with Antoinette refusing to acknowledge du Barry and du Barry using all her powers of emotional manipulation over the King to break Antoinette and show her who the de facto First Lady of France is.

Of course, du Barry doesn't seem to have the sense to see where this has to end, and when the inevitable happens and Louis XVI ascends the throne, one of Antoinette's big problems is at an end.  Unfortunately, the fact that Louis' father had died young means that the couple are ascending to their positions far too young.  They are also painfully mismatched, with Antoinette loving parties and dances and Louis preferring quiet downtime with hobbies like hunting and lockmaking.  Oscar, touched, vows to protect Antoinette - but the royal couple are oblivious to the bitter disappointment of the initially enthusiastic masses when their reign fails to improve their standard of living - and Antoinette drowns her sorrows by getting a little too close to Swedish statesman/soldier Fersen, buying ever more elaborate dresses, and generously lavishing gifts on favorites...

How much you'll like Rose of Versailles depends largely on what you think of Shoujo.  Hugely influential, this is - in a nutshell - the anime that Ouran High School Host Club is lampooning.  The heroines sparkle.  The heroes sparkle.  Even the villains and villainesses sparkle when there aren't visual cues behind them reminding you of their evilness.  The relationship between Antoinette and Fersen is presented almost in the terms of a Harlequin romance.  One episode ends with Andre vowing three times in succession that he's going to die for Oscar (think the writers are warning us to brace ourselves much?)

On the other hand, the series shows real promise in the ominous hints of what's going to happen in Part 2.  It pretty accurately starts laying out how and why the royal couple - not evil but ultimately criminally out of touch with what the majority of their people were experiencing - ended up where they did.  There's a slow buildup including Oscar's discreet hints to Antoinette, the presentation of the masses as literally starving, and a few coincidental meetings between Oscar and a young aspiring lawyer named Robespierre that leave no doubt that the series will ultimately ""go there"".  As for the fashion and architectural design, the series will undoubtedly be compared to it's younger Seinen brother Chevalier D'Eon in the same time period and several common locations.  While I'd give D'Eon the edge, Rose of Versailles holds it's own, which is rather remarkable considering it's age (1979-80).

Finally there's Oscar herself - the Shoujo Heroine of Heroines.  Her situation - an open crossdresser in the 1700's in her position who has even half the female characters in love with her - is inherently absurd, but she's so poised, honest and fair that you can overlook all of that.  There are also alot of other impressive female characters including Antoinette's remarkable mother Maria Theresa, the only female Habsburg ruler.  It's also notable that the male characters are not torn down to build the females up.  In particular, Andre, the male lead, is a warm, fun man with a real sense of humor who's a good match to Oscar.

Recommended for those who want a melodrama steeped in some historical accuracy, and a staple for anyone building a Shoujo collection.",1368316800,12,4508,4.912928759894459
5627485,5,B00BJ3AQL0,"When you think shojo anime like Revolutionary Girl Utena, you must thank The Rose of Versailles. The manga set the gold standard for shojo manga forever, and the anime adaptation by legendary director Osamu Dezaki (Space Adventure Cobra, Black Jack OVAs), lives up to that standard. Part 1 is a sparse but beautiful package; you only get subtitles and trailers, but for 20 great episodes of old school anime in a nicely tough box, it's definitely worth the purchase.",1368230400,5,466,4.9113924050632916

There are also episode synopses on the back of each dvd case, which is extremely convenient. The only thing I don't like is that the box has a sort of marble pattern on it that looks more like dirt/imperfections. Not a very wise design choice, but it's hardly noticeable. Overall this box set is SO worth it for the price, I love it.",1417564800,,498,3.99

8569319,5,B00BJ3AQL0,"I was thrilled when I saw that ""Lady Oscar - The Rose of Versailles"" had finally been released on DVD in the US. This was my favorite childhood show when I was growing up in Germany and to this day remains one of my favorite Animes. The story chronicles the rise and fall of French queen Marie Antoinette and spans the time frame from 1770 until the French Revolution in 1789. The main character is Marie Antoinette's Captain of the Royal Guard, Oscar Jarjayes. Although Oscar is a woman, she was brought up as a man by her father and becomes one of Antoinette's most loyal and trusted friends. The story also incorporates characters from Paris's poorer strata and documents the harsh life of the peasants in comparison with the luxurious ones of France's nobility.

This show is based on the original manga series by Ryoko Ikeda in the 1970s and contains a beautiful intermingling of romance, melodrama, intrigue, humor, tragedy, and charm. While many events in this show are based on real people and events (e.g., the necklace affair), Oscar is fictional.

This disc set is the first of two, and contains the first 20 episodes. The episode titles are as follows:
Disc 1: (1) Oscar!, the destiny of the Rose; (2) Fly! The Butterfly of Austria; (3) Sparks Fly at Versailles; (4) Roses, Wine, and the Conspiracy...; (5) With Tears of Dignity...
Disc 2: (6) The Silk Dress and the Ragged Dress; (7) Who Wrote the Love Letter; (8) Oscar in My Heart; (9) The Sun Sets, the Sun Rises; (10) The Beautiful Devil, Jeanne
Disc 3: (11) Fersen Leaves for the Northern Lands; (12) On the Morning of the Duel, Will Oscar...?; (13) Winds of Arras, Answer Me...; (14) The Angel's Secret; (15) The Countess of the Casino
Disc 4: (16) Mother, Her Name Is...; (17) Now, the Moment of Encounter; (18) Suddenly, Like Icarus; (19) Farewell, Little Sister!; (20) Fersen, a Farewell Rondeau

The audio track is Japanese with English subtitles and the picture quality is good. There are no extras besides a trailer on this disc set. This is hands down one of my favorite TV shows ever created and I know I will be watching it many times to come.",1391904000,,2121,4.63563829787234
8569320,5,B00BJ3AQL0,"I 'm glad I finally took the chance on this series.

8569322,5,B00BJ3AQL0,"The Holy Grail of shoujo anime is available officially in America by Nozomi Entertainment. Nozomi literally means ""hope"" and they have always delivered!

Rose of Versailles is one of those watershed series that defined an animation genre for decades to come. What might seem like cliched tropes now were fashionable and popular back in the 1970's.
Rather than review the series plot, I'll go over the characters. Mind you, this is just my opinion...

Main characters:
Oscar Francois de Jarjeyes:  Our leading lady. While the early episodes focus on the young Austrian princess Marie, Oscar is the bold knight protecting her. It's not made entirely clear why she ""chose"" her duty, but boy, she does it well! Protecting a princess, her family, and her best friend. Her sheltered background as a noble makes her flawed character, but her endearing spirit makes one applaud her efforts to work on those flaws.

Her design in the early episodes looks a bit odd, with her almost tomboyish haircut, she truly does look like a 18th century young man.  In the final 2 episodes on this set, the animation direction changed, so Oscar looks much older and prettier.

Marie Antoinette: Princess and Queen-to-Be of France. God, love those sparkling eyes!  Her melodramatic bursts early on will either make you roll your eyes, laugh, or perhaps, love her. Too bad that love doesn't last long. She's a flighty teenager with no sense of responsibility whatsoever.  She uses her heart instead of her brain, and the peasants of Paris suffer for it.  All Antoinette has going for her is her looks at this point.

Andre Grandier: What a GREAT young man!  His devotion to Oscar is apparent from the first.  There's not much character development for him though, but he does shine in a few key places in these early episodes.

Count Hans Axel Von Fersen: I must ask, what the HELL does anyone see in this guy? He's a pretty boy, and that's about it. He loves Marie, but he leaves. Then comes back. Then leaves again. Make up your mind, will you?!
He has some key scenes but nothing really remarkable to speak of here.

Supporting cast:
General Jarjeyes:  More a plot device to move Oscar forward. A jerk and a ultra-conservative who has raised family honor and tradition to the status of a faith.

Nanny: The much needed comedy relief. An old lady with a funny voice who scolds Andre and dotes on Oscar. A nice contrast to the ""master"" of the Jarjeyes household.

Rosalie La Molier: This poor peasant girl goes through a ringer of emotions. Naivete, grief, blind rage, passionate drive, an unrequited love, then grief again.  I love her Japanese voice actress, she can scream and cry like nothing I've heard.

Prince Louis:  Silly boy. Nothing more.

Villains:
Boy, there are a LOT of them here.  Too many to list. Noble men and women who want nothing more than power, money and prestige. And not even their own family members are immune to their schemes to get it.  We see two of the villains get their comeuppance in this set, and another minor villain go through a tragedy which, in some way, redeems her character in the end.

Conclusion:
The old school style of art may turn some new anime fans off, but if you're a fan of melodramatic period drama and cross dressing heroines with swords, you'll love it.",1377388800,5,3287,4.726315789473684
