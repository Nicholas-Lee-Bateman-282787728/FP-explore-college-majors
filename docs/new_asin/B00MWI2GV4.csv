Love the way it's filmed, the soundtrack, the individuals who share their stories and the intimate look into a culture few of us understand but so many of us judge. I hope the guys at Highway Goat keep these films coming!",1416441600,,316,4.372881355932203
6602968,5,B00MWI2GV4,"Great, cutting edge documentary, which profiles the lives of American train hoppers. This film dives directly into the world the world of America's young urban explorers; revealing their past lives, travels, and philosophies. Highly recommend for anyone looking to view a great social documentary.",1416441600,,297,5.7727272727272725
6602969,5,B00MWI2GV4,"I love being opened to a world I knew little about and feeling like I can connect and understand it. Freeload did just that, it was eye opening and heart felt, and went above and beyond satisfying my desire to end a documentary more knowledgeable than when I started.
It's funny, sad, quirky and real.
If I could hug all the characters from this film, make them a warm meal and send them socks, I would in a heartbeat.",1416441600,,418,4.30379746835443

8675086,5,B00MWI2GV4,"A very eye-opening look into the world of riding the rails and living your life free. This movie will make you feel and think, which is amazing in my opinion! I have bought and gifted multiple copies because I think more people need to see this movie, and everyone who has loved it! Big love from Little D!",1416960000,,306,4.293103448275862
8675087,5,B00MWI2GV4,"I had the opportunity to meet the director of this film, Daniel Skaggs, while in Erie PA over this past summer.  At the time he was filming his next film, ""Skips Stones for Fudge.""  I walked off from our discussion interested, impressed and intrigued. It is a rare circumstance to meet someone like Dan and the passion and thoughtfulness he brings to his films.  I was counting down the days to when Freeload was to be released.  This film is nothing short of what I expected.  This film leaves you with an understanding of a culture very few know about while instilling a curiosity that has led to me watching the film six times and wanting more.  Dan has done an amazing job exploring and balancing the philosophical aspects of ""freedom"" with the gritty cold loneliness from which it is sometimes built.",1416873600,,805,4.633802816901408
8675088,5,B00MWI2GV4,"This documentary is shot from the perspective of a real traveler, traveling with the subjects in the film. This first-hand account lends credibility and nuance that an outsider could not achieve. The stories of the travelers and their choices are compelling if sometimes chilling. The interpretation is honest, and the filmmaker - like the travelers - is a free thinker.",1416700800,,370,5.183333333333334
8675089,5,B00MWI2GV4,I am a programmer for docs at a truly cool film fest. This film was my favorites to intro and offer q and a. It spans generations and tax brackets. Don't miss it. Daniel skaggs the director was called masterful by director tony kaye. He was right.,1416614400,,247,4.276595744680851
8675090,4,B00MWI2GV4,"Freeload is a very honest look at today's counter culture youth.  This documentary exposes us to the human side of those kids that you want to avoid at all cost.  Hearing from these kids directly about how and why they are ""traveling broke and hungry"" is compelling.  You feel sorrow, disgust and hope when listening to their stories. Very well edited and the musical score is almost a character itself.  Do yourself a favor and get to know these kids.",1416528000,,452,4.6125
8675091,5,B00MWI2GV4,I feel bad for you if you haven't seen this awesome documentary.,1416528000,,64,4.416666666666667
8675092,5,B00MWI2GV4,"I love it. This is exactly what I want to see in a documentary: great subject matter, great characters, and a yanking of the heart strings. It is the exploration of a culture I bump into every time I pull up to a traffic light and find a ragged human flying some cardboard. A culture that both fascinates and frightens me, that is curiously more mysterious than the Masai of Africa. A culture not covered in color spreads in National Geographic. A culture I am far more likely to join myself one day.",1416441600,,500,4.387096774193548
8675093,5,B00MWI2GV4,Freeload offers a glimpse into the lives of modern day nomads that will probably make you question your own reality. The epitome of a good documentary. I truly enjoyed living vicariously through the characters that are so raw yet lovable.,1416441600,,238,4.975
