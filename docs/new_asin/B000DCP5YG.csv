While Peterson does show some interesting techniques on how to improve bland photos he often neglects to go in depth on how or why they work.  I feel that he is making 'the perfect picture' particularly difficult for beginners.  A perfect example is his discussion about Graduated Neutral Density filters.  He does not say anything about the different grades or how exposure is affected when using or choosing one.

Another example is metering off of his palm  +1 to render whites accurately.  Does he assume everyone on the planet has a white skin tone just like him and they will meter off their palm +1?  I know because I am more advanced, but imagine someone trying this who has no idea?  Well this is thanks to Bryan Peterson and his tendency for being incomplete.  I don't know what hes counting on perhaps some future DVD that you can buy later?  If you are serious about composition and learning anything besides the fundamental, basic basic stuff , look elsewhere.",1250812800,2,1020,4.706214689265536

You do not need a fancy camera to make use of 90% of the info on this DVD.  Bryan teaches you how to pay attention to all aspects of photography. It will help you avoid taking those awful ""myspace shots"" that convey nothing with awful colors made by harsh/unnecessary use of flash, not standing in the right spot and not looking beyond your subject.  Basically you're taught to look at everything and never again use the ""AUTO"" features of any camera (the little running, flower,portrait icons) and all those fluffy features on Point and shoots.  You will learn how to use those scary settings ""M""anual,  ""A""pperture, ""S""hutter on your camera. At the end you'll see that they aren't scary at all!

I think one of the best examples in the video is the peacock picture at the zoo.  First example is the one we all have taken, a picture of the peacock, walking in a cage at a zoo. Thats what it tells people, ""i saw a bird in a zoo"".  He then shows you how to fill the frame with the peacock. The new picture is of a peacock and you can tell someone, i did this at the zoo, no need to include the ugly fence. We all know their are birds in the zoo, we want to see the beautiful bird they have, and only that!

If you're thinking of buying a better camera, not necessarily a DSLR, after watching this, you will know what to really look for in your new point and shoot cameras and won't be afraid of stepping outside the ""auto"" modes.

Bryan does an excellent job at presenting.  He speaks in ""sesame street"" language making this pleasant and easy to follow by kids and adults, and even the geeks.

He covers materials from his two books, Understanding Exposure and Understanding shutter speed.  I advice you watch this video first, then dive into the books for detail. If you have already read his books like me, it really helps to. You follow along with the video and will pick a concept or two you might not have understand when you read it. If by the end you feel that you knew all that info already from the book, congrats! that means you have a great basic foundation, its like taking a test w/o the stress of grades.

Highly recommended watch it.  I hope he makes more of these.",1208563200,4,2287,4.363207547169812
8102351,5,B000DCP5YG,"I was looking for a single DVD to give as Christmas gift to friends and family photo enthusiasts.

The narration and instruction are clear and interesting, moving along at a fast pace to cover many topics.  What is remarkable about this DVD is that even the background of each video scene is composed beautifully.  Mr. Peterson is a practiced presenter, and every lesson includes a video of the process as well as the resultant photograph.

I wish Mr. Peterson would make another DVD that specializes in family photography.",1167350400,,523,4.909090909090909

The lay out is excellent and you only have to watch the sections that interest you. It is also nice to get an idea of what is possible and what kind of equipment you need to take the pictures you want.

I have bought several copies for friends who are just getting into photography.",1148860800,7,392,4.213333333333333
