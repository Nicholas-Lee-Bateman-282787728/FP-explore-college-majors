2617354,4,B000GTJSO4,"Unlike the first person who reviewed season 3, I think this season outbeats the 1st season by a long shot....more story lines in season 3, and less sex....not that i have a problem with sex scenes, but season 1 i feel just had way too many.  I don't think season 3 was as good as the 2nd season (i think season 2 is the best thus far), but i do think it was good...definitely worth buying.",1154736000,7,389,4.118421052631579
2617355,2,B000GTJSO4,"As The L-Word has gone from season to season, its quality has dropped. The first season was an excellent five-star affair. Season 2 was decent and deserved three-stars. And Season 3, an abysmal two stars. I would give it one star, but I might need that one for Season 4.  I'm sorry. Actually I'm not the one who should be apologizing: the writers and producers should be. I can count on a few fingers the number of episodes that were worth watching more than once.

It felt like I was looking at a sensationalistic goofy show like Desperate Housewives rather than an intelligent show about sophisticated lesbians. The writers make unwise storyline decisions. Plausibility, at times is stretched and some stories are unnecessary and end up going nowhere.

Watch Season 3 once, then replay your taped episodes from Season 1 and half the episodes from Season 2. Then pray that Season 4 will restore some kind of freshness and intelligence to this show.

The buzz I've been hearing thus far sounds promising.",1154390400,48,1004,4.819767441860465
2617356,5,B000GTJSO4,"I'm looking forward to receiving the season 3 DVD which I have preordered . Here in Australia the Seven Network has recently shown the second season over 12 months after it aired in the USA. If season 2 is anything to go by season 3 should be a knockout.

A huge fan here in the land down under.",1152835200,14,295,4.086206896551724

2617434,5,B000GTJSO4,"As usual you will need a scorecard to keep track of all of the relationships of the 8 main characters. To me Bett and Tina seem to have the most complicated relationship but the others are gaining ground. I love how they keep sticking their noses in each others business. That behavior would provoke fist fights in real life. So come on gang, bett, tina, carmen,shae, jennie, dana, kit, alice, and now moira and helena cannot wait for you to stick your nose in their business! Watch and enjoy.",1438387200,,493,4.550561797752809
2617435,1,B000GTJSO4,Season 1 was a novelty for me since I don't have HBO. Season 2 & 3 has been more of the same. But is getting more repugnant with it's selfish & unlikable characters. I quit watching mid-season 3 moved on to The Good Wife. Much better quality show. What's the big deal with Shane anyway? They act like she's some kind of lesbian goddess. She is not all that.,1437436800,,357,4.188405797101449

It makes me long for this type of support in my own life. Before you judge the show for being lesbian-based, watch and see for yourself how good it really is.

2617581,5,B000GTJSO4,"It is interesting, or worrisome, how many people comment about their preception of Jenny's
""stupidity"" or how ""borning"" the character is. I find the character's succintness soooo satisfying. She consistently nails people in rather few well-chosen words. She sees who the people around her are and tells them ""like it is"". During the early first season I found the Jenny character cloying and really annoying. But as I watched her evolve throughout the three seasons I found I really respect her as a woman who says what she means and means what she says. She's real and true to herself and her hard-won truths. Instead of zipping by the Jenny parts of the various episodes, I wish some of you would really hear what she has to say. Maybe you would see her for who and what she is and where she's been. How many of us truly meet and grapple with our demons and come out of the struggle with our hearts and minds not only intact but also with our wits honed to such a fine edge?

Season Three finds Jenny as well as all the other characters more deeply immersed in their ""s**t"" than ever before.  I think this season depicts the pain and strength of Jenny, Dana, Alice, Billie, Bette, Helena, et al. and their ability to deal with the unfairness and complexity of life.  Some may find this boring.  I find it moving, involving, uplifting and wonderful.  How sad some reviewers see Jenny's scenes as an ocassion to ""fast forward to the sexy parts"".

2617583,2,B000GTJSO4,"Where to start.  I'll start by saying I have rarely been more disappointed in a series as I am with the 3rd season of The L Word.  I really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd seasons, and how miserably off course this series has strayed is hard to fathom, because the first couple seasons do not remotely resemble the train wreck that is the 3rd season of this series.

Was there a writers' strike during this season, because the writing, casting, and character development were absolutely horrid.  Amateurish, at best.  Why, oh why, the writers did what they did during this season is something for which I just don't think there is a logical answer.  For example, the Billie Blaikie character is beyond annoying.  Not only is this character totally irritating, but he's useless in terms of the story line.  A complete and utter bore, and why the writers would decide to infuse this Jar Jar Binks-like personality into The L Word world is beyond me.

Moira/Max.  Need I say anything more?  Pairing this character with Jenny made no sense.  Absolutely no sense.  Jenny is devoloping her identity with her newly found orientation, and what do the writers decide to do? Pair Jenny with a woman who wants to become a man.  Can they butcher what could otherwise be a potentially great character (Jenny) any further?  Just how idiotically confusing do they want to make this character, anyway.  I'm sorry, Moira/Max didn't fit in this show and I found her/his character a needless distraction, particularly considering the obvious lack of chemistry with Jenny.

Let's not forget about Angus.  Could the writers have found a more dull character this side of the Milky Way?  Ohhhhhh no, not just dull.  Goofy, too.  If they would have limited his role to babysitting Bette and Tina's baby, I would not be so upset.  But come on, having him romantically involved with Kit made me cringe and gave me the willies every time they were together.  Just another example of horrid writing and misplaced character dependencies.

Spoiler ahead, folks.  The absolute strategic blunder of the entire series and evidence which is proof positive that the writers were out to lunch for this entire season--killing off Dana.  Why did they do this?  Dana was such a sweet, innocent character who many could empathize with, because her family was so conservative and she had struggled so much with coming out.  I'm really quite bitter with this writing decision, and the decision to take this valuable character off the series simply tells me the writing isn't what it should have been.  A mind numbing lack of vision was involved with this writing decision, because Dana, like all of the core characters, offers the series versatility and great character depth.  A huge and completely unnecessary loss for this series.

I'm not happy with the direction of this series.  The writing stinks.  Too many characters make no sense.  Character development is the pits.  Strategic decisions to get rid of important characters is being carried out without much thought, it seems.  I'll see what they have to offer for the 4th season, and if the writers of this series want a legacy for this show, let's hope they apply more logic to subsequent seasons....",1202947200,6,3211,4.8597785977859775

2617617,4,B000GTJSO4,"I have watched the L-Word from the very start and comparatively, the Season 2 was better than Season 1 and 3(It also had a better musical theme). The Season 1, I found the lesbian couple(played by Jennifer Beals and Laurel Holloman) there so convincing that you would think they are real lesbians in real life! And what about boyish Shane...just a real eye candy for all the lesbians out there. I think, every lesbian is in love with her(laugh out loud).What I found quite putting-off though was the injecting of  heterosexual characters(boy and girl)there who seems to have more love scenes in the whole series than the lesbians...who seems to HOG the screen most of the time too. Isn't the L-Word a lesbian series, after all??? Let it stay that way please! Why can't they simply just make a lesbian series that is ""all lesbian""??? I think, the producers have this silly notion that straight people won't watch a series without heterosexuality on the plot/story which is just pure misconception. Heterosexuals are ever so interested on how the ""other kind"" lives, thrives and even, become intimate. They are big voyeurs to the unknown and not spoken of! So, for goodness sake, make a proper all-lesbian series!!! Even more so on the 2nd Season, what's more irritating is the heterosexual girl on Season 1 becomes totally gay here(totally transformed and not interested in men anymore, duh!). Isn't change a gradual thing?  This demeans our intelligence, in my opinion. The one who wrote this must have been straight as a ruler to NOT know the real world or facts about lesbianism!!! And, what is this about another straight black woman singer  who looks ridiculously outcasted in this world of gays and les? I didn't see her story as any help in ""putting meat"" on the whole series, sorry to say. To put it blunt, the producers just wasted good money paying for ""misplaced"" talent(though she sings real good admittedly). I was expecting the 3rd Season to be better, but alas, they lost the story all throughout here. What a big disappointment!!! A lesbian character dying in this season didn't help boost the ratings as they have expected it would, I suppose. Nobody likes to see people dying, gay or straight! I think, what they should have done here was expand on the lives of the characters more(such as put flashbacks about their past lives, how they became to be, etc.). It would have been better too if they added more ""credible gay characters"" ...new, fresh faces, as we say. Even Gina Gershon(Of ""Bound""), though quite mature, would have lifted their ratings sky up if they have included her in the cast. And, what about REAL lesbians included in...Ellen De Generis(a real cutie!), K.D. Lang, Melissa Etheridge, Portia de Rossi...they would be real ""crowd-drawers""!!!

  I think, it is about time they leave gay filming to those who know the ""raw deal""...not just because they want to create a fad or exploit the world unknown to them or even more, just make money out of it. Lesbian producers, anyone for the taking?",1179360000,,3025,4.8301158301158305

2617620,4,B000GTJSO4,"I became hooked on L Word from watching season 4 on Showtime.  So I ordered seasons 1 and 2 and finally season 3.  I agree with several other posters who  say that key characters' personalities seem to have done 180's.  Bette turns into a marshmallow; Tina suddenly ""needs a man;"" level-headed Alice becomes a pill-popping stalker; and Helena the conniver becomes Helena the connived.

Unlike some others, though, I find the Moira/Max (Daniela Sea) storyline interesting and thought-provoking.  The scenes in which Dylan falls for Helena were oh-so-sexy (and I'm straight!); but the video set-up for the sexual harrassment suit was stupid and it was clear to the viewer what would happen next.  I could have done without the Billie character.  Angus and Kit had some cute moments, but the whole menopause storyline could have been far more interesting and real without Angus.

And why kill off Dana?  She was, by far, the most entertaining character on the show--coordinated but goofy, smart but out of it.  I can only assume that Erin wanted out of the show for some reason.

Now for the DVD's themselves:  what's up with the sad extras?  One of my favorite things about the season 2 DVD's was the commentary by Leisha, Kate, and Erin for the ""Land Ahoy"" episode.  It was hysterical.  When I opened up season 3 and realized there was no commentary on any of the episodes by anyone, I felt really cheated.  Please, please, please, Showtime, when you put out the season 4 DVD's, put commentary by cast members on at least four episodes.  Take a leaf out of NCIS' (or CSI's) book!",1177200000,9,1578,4.760147601476015
2617621,4,B000GTJSO4,"I breathe a huge sigh of relief as the writers have finally seemed to hit their stride! The writing in this season is the best so far.

The storyline keeps moving and changing in a way that creates a very unique journey among this group of friends. Once again, commendations for taking on very real topics, including trans identity, menopause, joint parenting, and cancer.

The acting shines on almost everyones part. My new favorite character, ""Angus the Manny"" is probably the worst actor, but he's so likeable, it's okay.

As others have said, unfortuately the Betty music is still around, but it is _much_ less prevalent and distracting. The rest of the music is actually pretty decent.

Another negative point is that not only are old dropped story lines not picked up, but the habit of dropping stories w/o explaination continues. Also, no amazing guest stars ala Cameron Manhiem or Sandra Bernhardt from Season 2.

Packaging: They finally got wise and used slim-case design, which is great b/c it doesn't waste space, but now it doesn't match the other 2 seasons. There are some great special features, but there are at least two major spoilers right on the package, so don't look at it too closely as you're putting the discs in.

Still a solid 4-star show - can't wait for season 4. Maybe I can finally give it 5 stars...",1176854400,5,1330,4.735930735930736
2617622,5,B000GTJSO4,At last the third series is available. Unfortunately unless you have a multi region DVD -player in the UK you have to wait forever for it to be released in Region 2 format.

2617624,2,B000GTJSO4,"I think the L-Word is dying a slow and painful death. Season 3 gives us the death of the one character that has truly developed and grown since the series inception (Dana). Also we have Kit, the character who in my opinion has been a pointless character from day one, getting pregnant as soon as she hits menopause. The fact that Pam Grier (Kit) is old enough to be the grandmother of most of the cast seems to have been overlooked in this particular piece of the storyline. Kit dying of breast cancer would have made for a far more believable plot, even the folks putting the series together admit in an interview on the DVD that it would be unusual for somebody the age of the character Dana dying from breast cancer is unlikely. I appreciate the fact that cancer doesnt discriminate and kills anyone, the way those responsible for the series chose to highlight such an important subject, has for me detracted from the quality of the show.

Season 1 was great, season 2 was not quite up to the same standard but the way season 3 developed has taken the show down to the level of an evening version of a day-time soap. The kidnapping has already in the season finale, it's just going to be a matter of time before the murder's start coming.",1174867200,4,1241,4.442982456140351

The prologues preceding every episode (including names and how they're connected) capture how people and places, times and situations, tie everyone in this world of unpredictability together.

2617657,4,B000GTJSO4,"The third season of the L Word picks right up with all the excitement, romance, and sexual tension of the previous seasons. Alice is struggling to get over the loss of her best friend and her lover while Dana moves on with Lara. One of the biggest turns of the season comes when Dana is diagnosed with breast cancer and the women struggle to help her cope and to deal with it themselves.  Tina and Bette's daughter, Angelica, is six months old and the two have done their best to reconcile and form a stable home for her. Bette is in the process of trying to adopt Angelica, so the couple has routine visits with a social worker. Shane and Carmen are in a committed relationship and living together in Jenny's house. Carmen's job as a dj is starting to pick up and she's even offered a position djing for Russell Simmons at some point. Shane opens a hair studio in the middle of a skateboard shop and, in typical Shane fashion, struggles to stay loyal to her (gorgeous) girlfriend. Jenny is off on a road trip somewhere with a girl named Moira who has a gender identity crisis. At some point during the season Moira becomes Max and decides to transition to a male. Meanwhile Jenny struggles to sell her book. Kit finally gets a storyline besides being the alcoholic has been sister and even finds a love interest. And finally, in one of the best additions, Helena Peabody is finally a full member of the cast and has her own story lines not involving Bette and Tina.

This season of the L Word is emotionally charged and takes some chances that they haven't in previous years. With the addition of Moira, the show brings the first transgendered recurring role to network television. Though Jenny's story line typically bores me to tears and, I'll admit, I usually fast forward through a large portion of her scenes, this season actually made me interested to see what would go on. Jenny finally found someone who was her match. The heartbreak that exists with Alice when she sees Dana and Lara constantly is palpable, and completely relatable. I don't think anyone who has ever had their heart broken can look at what she went through without understanding how well done and realistic the emotion was. When we lose Dana later in the seaon, it only intensifies and finally gives Alice a chance to shine as someone besides the confused bisexual girl. On the same token, it's nice not to see Kit sitting around just being everyone else's go to girl and instead having her own story. The addition of Angus, Angelica's manny, as Kit's boyfriend finally brings a little meat to the Pam Grier character.

The third season of the L Word is quite possibly the best one yet. A lot of the original characters have story lines that give them a chance to show their artistic range, and the new characters are welcome additions whose stories all add to the plot. I can't wait to see what's going to happen in the fourth season.",1169424000,19,2913,4.5659655831739965

I don't get cable TV, so Showtime is out of the question.  This is something I've done every year now, simply purchase the series.  The characters go through interesting transitions and yes, there are plenty you love to hate.  But it's like a good book, you can't wait to go home and watch the next episode when you've just bought the series to see what happens to the girls next!  It's hot, it's fun, and yes,.

All the characters I love have a personality overhaul (Bette is a wimp, Tina is a bitch, Alice is a stalker, etc.)They kill the goofy and funny Dana. Why? What were they thinking? The only new character I like is Dylan (so glad she screwed Helena.) The Moira/Max character is just weird and abusive (perfect match to Jenny btw.) I don't mind she is not as pretty as the other lipstick lesbians on the show, but her character just isn't likable.

It is sad what happened to Dana.  I was horrified.  I am a breast cancer survivor who elected not to have chemo.  Unfortunately one out of every 8 women will get breast cancer.  Chemo is what kills many of these women...not the cancer itself.  Chemo weakens your immune system, damages and sometimes destroys organs in our bodies and can even, ironically, cause cancers.  Face it, we may not like to think about it, but this is a very real fact of life.  I applaud the writers of The L Word for outing this disturbing fact.",1165363200,4,691,4.3359375

Why why why why why??????? This season did have it's good moments, and I agree that changing things up a bit keeps any good series on edge. But a total freaking overhaul? Very disappointing. The season ended with me not liking most of the characters.

2617738,4,B000GTJSO4,"I have mixed reviews; 4 stars for attempts at change (would have been 3 if this had been the first season). I liked the ""list"" format for this...

1. Dana.  Sad but what a story line.  As much as I hated to see that character go, it was a stroke of genious. The ending when they put her ashes into the waterfall pool, and the song ""..I will always be here"" played, PERFECT. The sweetness and beauty of Dana will really be a huge loss.  It will be hard to fill, but vital that the series pick up someone we can love without worrying that she'll turn out to be a creep.
2. Alice's emotional level (great acting though) and change from carefee to sullen (and a stalker?) was a drag.  We needed her as she was; we miss her joy! Good bend with Lara - it makes sense and that happens a lot in reality.
3. Bette and Tina - UGH!!!  Their story was totally tedious!  Tina has become a complete bore, Bette a miserable shadow of herself. And the ""going straight"" again for Tina?  It was so excruciating.  And hell, if you were ever going to let Bette have an affair, WHY oh WHY not with the fabulous Dana Delaney!?
4. Shane. Can the woman get no redemption??  Leaving Carmen at the alter was such a thud - and YEAH, right - boinking that dork Cherrie with Carmen at home?  To take a character that far out into the light, then to have her fail in such a despicable way.  Shane's hard not to like, but, no way will she ever be anything but a ""ho"" - oh, sorry, ""what she is"" from now on, no matter HOW respectable of a woman they try to shove her toward - we'll never buy into any of it.
5. Carmen. Too lovely not to keep around. Not a very good job of trying to draw in the Latino angle, but, a good try. Bring in an amazing older woman for her!
6. Helena - what a switch from bad to a potentially good person; nice upswing with her, I liked her becoming a decent human being.  Appropriate that she got royally burned by Dylan! ...and the twist with her mother was WONDERFUL!
7. Dylan - YES!  God, what a GREAT character and that twist was awesome!!  Loved the ""love scenes"" with her - HOT!!! (Ellen, you dope!)
8. Kit and Angus...OK, not very believeable, but kinda sweet.
9. Max. I'm sorry but, OMG WHAT?? As hard as it is to stretch our lesbian reality into a pack of all beautiful women, it was nearly impossible to imagine Max breaking into the bunch, she/he was just too ""out there"" - but, if anyone could, it's the ever weird Jenny..
10. Jenny. She's just too weird.
11. Billie - yeesh, creepy - and that sex scene with Max - did we REALLY need to experience that??
12. Glad they're gone: IVAN, Candice, Gabby..
13. I'd love to see Marina brought back into the series.
14. And how about introducing some really classic actresses who have become legends (pay up, they're worth it to see them in lesbian rolls!)

This season was not so much funny, it was more dramatic.  Some of it I loved with the plot surprises and new characters (NOT MAX), but the story with Bette and Tina - I fast forwaded through a lot of that.  I hope it lightens up next year, gets some humor, finds more realistic plots, and let's go of the tedious and far far left issues.",1164412800,5,3144,4.194352159468439
2617739,1,B000GTJSO4,"OMG what have they done to this once funny, entertaining, sexy show. It has descended into a miserable risible badly written joke. The storylines are horrid, unconvincing, absurd, and cringe-making. Let me list some of these:

1. Max. I don't think I need to say any more about this bizarre addition to the show. Got just about everything wrong. Deeply embarrassing.

2. Dana. Why did she have to get ill and die ? She was one of the most lovable characters, goofy and yet sort of inspiring. A horrid horrid storyline. If I want health care messages I will go and watch documentaries. Profoundly depressing and upset the entire balance and mood of the show. How am I supposed to enjoy a sex scene one moment, and then a scene of mutilation ? To me it seemed utterly baffling and willful of the writers to do this to this character and this show. For this reason alone I hated the entire season. But there was more.

3. Helena. Sorry, who was this person ? Was she the same person in season 2 referred to as ""the scourge of the universe "" ? And as for that cringe-making risible sexual harassment set up scene ? One of the worse TV scenes I have ever had to watch.

4. Alice. A obsessed deranged stalker ? Thanks. Another of my favorite characters twisted into some un-characteristic pathetic storyline.

5. Bette. Take one strong dynamic character and stamp on her repeatedly with an utterly implausible and unbelievable plot development. Shove in an hysterically dopey spiritual retreat, and ask her to weep repeatedly. I felt sympathy for the actress who was in obvious discomfort.

6. Tina. Sorry ? All she needs is a bit of manhood ? Am I watching a show about lesbians, written by lesbians, validating lesbian life ? I must have missed something.

7. Kit and manny. Just get him off please. It is so wrong it is not even funny.

8. Shame and Carmen. Do you really think Shane would betray the gorgeous Carmen for that weird dopey Sherrie ? So unbelievable that I joked back the guffaws whilst flinching.

I could go on. Maybe I should. The show did. I am only half way through and have decided to abandon it. I can't take the stupidity, the sheer implausibility, the utter misery, the cringe-making plotlines and character development any more. I don't ask for much about a show dedicated for once in television history, to lesbian life: an attempt to show it in a postive light for hell's sake, rather than as a bunch of dysfunctional, feckless, cheating, manipulative, obsessive, stupid wierdos (albeit pretty).

It's cast a deeply melancholy air over my viewing life. I'm off to watch Alias 5 instead.",1164412800,15,2609,4.639913232104122
2617740,5,B000GTJSO4,"This show, including this season, is one that is groundbreaking and representative of many people who have not before been given representation. The focus is first and formost about women and the lives of women. There is love, loss, drama, and all that goes in between. It makes you laugh at times and cry at others, but life is not a fairytale and this show doesn't make it to be... that is what makes it so great. There a femmes and butches, a ton who are somewhere in the middle. It makes you reconsider the labels you place on people and realize there are all shades of gray. Whether you are a stay at home parent, trying to become a parent, happy in love, breaking up, sleeping around, or transitioning... from bed to bed or from female to male, you can see yourself in this show.

Some have been critical of Ilene Chaiken (not Irene as the misguided poster at top called her) claiming that the show isn't realisitc or that the writing is bad. We should remember that this show is about a group of lesbians, not all the lesbians in the world. It could be people we know but it might not be. To claim a show unrealistic because it isn't a story of your own life is to also say that every representation of every woman is only real if that woman goes through what you go through, that every reprentation of whatever race you are is only real if that person goes through what you go through, and given the wide variety of diversity in programming any reasonable person knows that to be untrue. So, no The L Word doesn't represent every lesbian on the planet but it does give a good account for a select group of us out there, it does venture to bring visibility to those of us who went unseen before, it gives us a voice, and it shows people that lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgered people love and hurt and face things in our life good and bad just like everyone else.

There is no other show out there that has done for lesbians what The L Word has. Seasoned actresses like Jennifer Beals and Pam Grier bring the show up a few levels, Jennifer Beals and Laurel Holloman have chemistry that is palpable... even when their characters are fighting they have tremendous chemistry. Rachel Shelley, Katherine Moening, Alexandra Hedison all have sex appeal through the roof in their representation of single lesbians on the show. Leisha does comedy like no one's business and she also had some amazing dramatic scenes. Erin Daniels was wickedly funny as well and broke our hearts with the huge part her character had in season 3. Daniella Sea is a new comer and she still has great strides to take. I wouldn't dare say she was the star as that would be a huge over-statment... she was far from it, but her character was like nothing we've ever seen before. Daniella took on her role like a champ and I was very excited to see her added to the cast, she is bringing visibility to an entire other part of the audience that had yet to be shown and in time I think she will be as comfortable as the other actresses. I certainly look foward to more from Max.

Also, despite what the initial reviewer had to say, I don't think there is any grounds for statements suggesting Ilene degraded, down played, or disrespected Danielle, the actress, or her character Moira/Max. If an actress is cast after promotions start then you cannot expect them to appear in all the promotional photos. Although Daniella wasn't in all the season 3 promotional photos she was in some of them, she is in those for Season 4 and she also did a great deal of in person promotions with Ilene to promote season 3. If Ilene wanted to down play and degrade Daniella she would not have made her the main guest star for most of the promotional events, she also would not have been so super secretive and hyped about Daniella's character on the show. There would be no transgendered character, or any butch type characters, or any kind of character we are fortunate to have on the show if Ilene was as horrible as this reviewer has made her out to be. Max and The L Word at large exists because of Ilene not in spite of her.

The one criticsim I have with the dvd itself and not the show... the dvd extras were lacking in any kind of special or additional footage that many fans like to see. There are no bloopers, no special interviews, nothing truly exciting to look foward to.

This is a great show. I definitely recommend it as a buy!!!",1162857600,21,4405,4.426633785450061
2617741,3,B000GTJSO4,"I rated this season at three stars for a few reasons. The writer's create such an unrealistic homophobic atomosphere. With the exception of one seen with Jenny and Moira, it is a little too unreal.

I also feel that the series ignores a talented actress. That is Danielle, who plays Moira. In my opinion, she was really the star that made season three interesting. Because she is not as ""feminite and pretty"" as the rest of the cast, she is not even in the photos. That includes the lword fan site. Irene (the writer) should be ashamed of herself. Irene degraded Danielle, in my opinion.

Also, the season sort of defies logic. It is an ""us against them""  mentality. With the exception of one seen with teenagers, this goes

beyond logic. Examples include :

1. An employer who openly discriminates during an interview. Not afraid of lawsuits. A little unreal.

2. An adoption agent who discriminates against orientation. She is very open and candid about not having a man as a parent.

The writers need to do a much better job with logic and realism. The acting is superb, and Danielle deserves a lot of credit. She is a very good actress.",1161993600,7,1140,4.6138613861386135
2617742,5,B000GTJSO4,"I Love, Love, LOVE The L Word! This is the best series about women BY FAR! A lot of people have compared it to QAF (Queer As Folk), but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, as both are amazing series. I own the 1st and 2nd L Word seasons (and have watched them over and over), and the 3rd is on it's way to my home as I type. I cannot wait!

This (3rd) season is pretty heavy. It is also shorter than the other two (I think). But, I have to say I still loved it so much! I cried like a baby towards the end of the season (those who watched it should know why).

If you are a lesbian, and want to see a series that you can relate to, I would definately reccommend this series!!!

It's great because it takes away stereotypes and lets people see that we are all just normal gals, who happen to love other normal gals!",1161561600,5,824,3.9518072289156625

I guess the only thing I didn't like about it was I felt as though I had missed something between the last episode of season 2 and the first episode of season 3 because it took a while to figure out what was going on. Needless to say I quickly got over that became rivited again to thise series that I would be completely lost without if it ended. All your favourite characters are back and a few introductions too. I laughed, I cried and most importantly.... I LOVED IT!!",1157673600,8,616,4.228813559322034
2617746,4,B000GTJSO4,"Anybody who says that they wish that the show would go back to the way it was in season one has ulterior motives - pay no attention to them - they're crazy for a relationship that was totally and completely dysfunctional (and boring), but these people have convinced themselves that Bette and Tina's relationship is 'romantic'.  Yeah, okay, whatever.  Basically, in their opinions, if they don't get what they want (ie. their favorite boring couple back together again), then everything about the show is bad, which is a little too like throwing the baby out with the bathwater, because even though Tina and Bette broke up (and will probably stay that way), the show is still one of the best and brightest on tv and season three of the L Word is proof positive of that...

Anyway, season three was definitely a return to form, if not a return to the relationships that were established in the pilot in season one - lots of great scenes with the group together (something season two was lacking), fascinating explorations of gender and sex and the gray areas that exist in society.  It touches on many other issues, but most of them will be very familiar to most viewers of the show.  Many of the episodes in season three are sad, because they're dealing with very heavy subject matter, but I honestly love both the heavy stuff and the funny, as well.  The actors and the chemistry they have with one another is unparalleled - they're all friends in real life and that energy follows them onto the screen.

If you want to see a bright star on the rise, then keep your eyes out for Katherine Moennig as Shane McCutcheon - trust me, you won't be sorry... her character is one of the most complex and fascinating characters I've ever been introduced to.

If you're someone who needs to be spoonfed every line and every plotpoint, then this show isn't for you... but if you don't mind a challenging dose of thought-provoking entertainment, then give season three of The L Word a try...

The only reason this season of the show gets 4 stars rather than 5 is due solely to the obnoxious barnacle in the personages of the band BETTY that still refuse to go away.  EZGirl's score for season three is quite a bit less distracting than it was in season two, but definite points off for basically devoting an entire freaking episode to the band.
