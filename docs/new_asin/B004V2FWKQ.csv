Basically it's from the book of (One Thousand and One Nights) where a lot of the Arabian folk stories. Movies, Arabian or else, had been fascinated by this great imagination and that pure wisdom, so too many movies had been made about these stories and on the top of them is Aladdin and his magical lamp.

One of the most entertaining treatments for such a story was the Egyptian classic (Afrita Hanem - 1949) where the huge genie becomes a tricky sexy girl who loves the young poor man through great musical comedy. Here (Shammi Kapoor) managed to add some wonderful elements on the original through making it also as a musical comedy.

Bundal Baaz's genie is so fat, so childish, so lovely, and wanting nothing but the happiness of his ""boss"". In one very smart scene we know that he, the genie, was an orphan and how he feels lonely and wants to be loved. So if you look closer you'll discover how (Raja) wasn't needing a genie all along, it's that one who sweetly forcing himself like a nagging sidekick yet well meaning. Further than that all the genies of the stories and the movies can fulfill just 3 or 7 wishes; however this genie would stay for a year with unlimited wishes to come true (suits 3 hours Indian movie for sure !). (Shammi Kapoor) as an actor made a perfect job to show us that kind infant-inside- big man. He was very funny and light. The cute star (Rajesh Khanna) along with the too charming (Sulakshana Pandit) made an adorable performance. Even (Johnny Walker) as (Suleiman M.A) was fine despite that the role didn't give him much to do or to say. I think this is a movie where everything was just comic and fanciful.

For instance: the sequence of Raja's own Taj Mahal, or the brilliant first meeting between (Raja) and the genie (it was authentic that Khanna didn't panic, he just smiled indifferently and walked away then to discover suddenly that IT IS a genie !), the genie proves his powers by turning a flower into an elephant !, not to mention of course the dresses of (Sulakshana Pandit) at the party.. That was too hot to be seen.. Thanks to the 1970s' fashionable mini skirts I think.

The joyful atmosphere is flawless, it got fast pace, fine sets, and touching memorable music by the great (RD Burman) especially the theme of the genie which repeated beautifully and variously throughout the movie (you can hear it for the first time while the genie's first intro). One of the best elements here was the special effects by (Babubhai Mistry), yes, it's not a Hollywood blockbuster, yes it was obvious at times, but largely there were super moments like the one in which the 2 lovers were singing on the snow along with the huge genie beside them.. That was REAL !

This script was simple and marvelous at its start. You can sense the urge slightly to present streets with poor inhabitants, little thieves, and so many alumnus young men whom find no job or even a meaning out of their education in a society doesn't confess anything but money, or respect anyone but the rich. So, naturally, on the other hand there was this riotous loud masquerade of the other class, the upper one, that living its heaven where, cleverly, the wealthy girl's father was a judge, and her evil brat cousin was a police officer. It's unmistakably one hot satire against some class that owned everything, including the authority, and another one that longs for a genie to measure up, or even get to live. I loved the party scene with its bitter irony (they are all liars, but the poor is the only honest one). Anyhow that tune wasn't deep or continuous; it was only the good environment for the fantasy to begin.

It seems that it got no meaning, but look at the climax where the guarding genie lost his power at the devil's cave, that wasn't for granted, it's one good move to show us how Raja doesn't need above-human magic to save his love as he must (and can) relay on his will only. Actually the problem is that they made the hero refuse the genie or to be rich since the beginning. So what really got changed in him after the whole thing? Nearly nothing ! And that surely weakened the drama.

Also there is some naivety (Raja throws the ring that can bring the demon in the street plainly !), some hastiness (the storyline of Raja's sister, the third act, and the end). But whatever, it's absolute fun, and in despite of being 3 hours it flows briskly just like (Shammi Kapoor) whom you've got to love for all of this hilarity and all of this innocence.",1305158400,,4627,4.48812351543943
