8300126,5,B001F0K87E,"The wonderful world of Cheburashka and Gena the crocodile comes to life in these few short films.  The Russian language and folk music are wonderful to hear, but subtitles are available, too.  Such a cute little guy, Cheburashka.",1319587200,,229,5.0
8300127,2,B001F0K87E,The disk arrived in wrapped package. Disk would not play in my all region DVD player. I have tested it and some of my other Russian movies on other DVD players. Only this movie has issues. It will work on the computer. Seller has not resolved the issue. I guess I can break from my work while my child uses my computer!,1298851200,,319,4.161290322580645
8300128,5,B001F0K87E,"You may be thinking the same thing when looking at this DVD, but in all honesty Cheburashka will not disappoint!

When I first heard of this lil guy I was on Facebook and I saw a friend had become a fan. I watched some of the YouTube videos there weren't any subtitles (the dialogue is Russian) but it didn't stop me from watching!

Cheb is such a cute little...er...fuzzy thing...Ha-ha, nobody knows what he is and even Cheb can't figure it out! Along the way he meets many friends, one being a Crocodile named Gena, and a wicked little old lady who likes to stir up trouble. The plots are very easy to follow and very fun! There are only four short episodes on this disk, but it is packed with laughes and adorable-ness! I definitely know why there is a following of dear Cheburashka!

This DVD is great for all ages! They have the regular Russian dialogue I recommend watching it in Russian with sub-titles to get the Cheb experience) as well as a dubbed English version. I was unimpressed with the dubbed version because the music is different and the voices seem weird to me. I love the little Russian musical numbers they sing!

Even if you've never seen any of Cheb, I'd recommend taking the leap of faith and just buy it; that is what I did and I am so happy I did!",1251849600,8,1273,4.358649789029536
