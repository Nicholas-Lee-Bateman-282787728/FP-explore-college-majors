6388610,3,B00JPQ1IPQ,"Mill Creek - please stop putting your logo / bug / watermark on the movie sets you market! If anyone on the face of the planet likes having that rubbish repeatedly disrupting what are already subpar transfers I would love to hear from them.  These sets are an OK value,  but movie buffs hate company watermarks popping up on purchased broadcasts.  These are privately owned sets, not some late night cable broadcast.  What's the point of buying your products if you are going to further deface unrestored films?  How about splicing in some cola ads too?  Otherwise this is a fun, cheap set.",1405382400,162,590,4.679611650485437
6388611,5,B00JPQ1IPQ,"I just bought this today (7/10/14) at Costco for $16.99 plus tax.  Which is a GREAT bargin!  I have ALWAYS enjoyed what Mill Creek Entertainment has put out.  And this is no exception!  Instead of putting all 100 movies into one package like they used to, Mill Creek Entertainment packages two of their 50 packs together.
  In this instance, they have packaged their ""Dive-In Movie Classics"" 50 Pack & their recently released ""B-Movie Blast"" 50 pack together.  With the ""Drive-In Movie Classics"" 50 Pack, it has the same movies that my old one does except they Took out the Film ""Unsane (1982)"" and added in the film ""Craze (1974)"".  The ""B-Movie Blast"" 50 pack repackages alot of films from other editions With some that Mill Creek hasn't yet.  Many of the movies are from the now defunct ""Crown International Pictures"" catalog that Mill Creek Entertainment now owns (or at least owns the majority of their Catalog), which Mill Creek tirelessly puts out in regular editions.  But this is a set well worth getting",1404950400,46,1013,4.803468208092486

6388629,5,B00JPQ1IPQ,"Most of these movies I will never watch twice.  But at about $.25 per movie...I am super pleased.  There is something unique and special about B movies that I love.  It is fun to watch and see if you can spot famous actors in small roles, etc.  I'm only part way through, but really enjoying having a lot of movies to see that I have never seen before, even if you skip thru a few of them.",1439683200,22,389,4.012987012987013

8653034,4,B00JPQ1IPQ,"I'm not going to review the content of this film collection, because at this price you're not going to be getting blockbusters.  However, if you're a jaded film buff looking for new content that's outside of the typical Hollywood experience, this set might be worth a go.  Now that we've established that there's no accounting for taste, on with the review.

I haven't watched every film on this set (not even close), but so far the transfers I have seen have hit two important points: they have (so far) all observed the original aspect ratio, and the digitization of the films have preserved a good amount of color and detail. I will update this review if I find one that's cropped to a different aspect ratio, as this is a very important thing for me.  Some have complained that the video quality of this set is on part with VHS; I must disagree, as it is substantially better than the VHS transfers I do myself.

The audio is not that great.  As one would expect, it is heavily compressed, but the films are at least watchable.
Also, if you were hoping for subtitles, you're out of luck.

From the aspect of one like me, a firm believer in film preservation, it was really nice to see a bevy of films on disc that would not have otherwise made a release.  Also, considering these films were just a few cents apiece, it is quite a deal.  Yes, a lot of these films have lousy production value and acting, but to be honest, not every multimillion dollar film wows me that much these days.  It's nice to see some originality, albeit with obvious traits that barred these films from being cinematic classics.",1521676800,10,1607,4.510344827586207
