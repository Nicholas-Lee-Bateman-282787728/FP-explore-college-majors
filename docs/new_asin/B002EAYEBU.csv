3916442,4,B002EAYEBU,"Not available in stores is this Manufacture-on-Demand release from the WB Archives program of 1968's ""The Sergeant"" starring Rod Steiger. While some may find the price steep for a bare-bones DVD release, your best bet is to check Warner's website daily for One Day Sales like I did. Persistence does pay off.

The story revolves around Rod Steiger as a decorated G.I. with over a quarter-century service. In the prologue, set in WWII, we see him commit a heroic act during an attack in France and kill one of the enemy with his bare hands.

Flash-forward to 1952 and Steiger returns to France to whip a lax company into shape. The ineffectual Captain is more than happy to let Steiger take over. Almost immediately, Steiger takes an interest in lanky recruit John Philip Law. He makes short work of convincing Law to take a clerical job so as to keep the object of his desire close. Slowly but increasingly, Law learns that the freedom and perks that come with being the Sergeant's ""pet"" come with a price.

The movie held my interest for all of its near two-hour running time. Steiger is fantastic in the title role but I wish that someone other than Law had been cast as the object of lust. A more traditionally handsome and rugged actor like Van Williams or Gary Lockwood would have made a much better casting choice and been more believable. Perhaps the producers found Law's tall, lean physique a good contrast to the portly Steiger. Since the movie depends on the chemistry and relationship between their two characters, a stronger actor in Law's role would have made for an even better picture.

The film apparently flopped upon its release due to the ""uncomfortable"" subject matter, but it has aged well. Though it supposedly takes place in 1952, the bar scenes find all the extras dressed in contemporary 1968 garb. Speaking of which, one such bar scene features a Freudian touch when the closeted Steiger is debating with the Francophones about the virtues of the American hot dog!

The widescreen print does suffer from a few blemishes, dirt and specks, but I have seen official DVD releases of vintage films that have looked no better.

Must-see viewing for those interested in vintage '60s gay-themed cinema such as ""Boys in the Band"" or ""Reflections in a Golden Eye"".",1293580800,9,2281,4.776649746192893
3916443,5,B002EAYEBU,"It's been along time since I last saw this wonderful movie. It was very daring in its theme and caused some negative banter from Hollywood conservatives! Rod Steiger give an emotional and powerful performance and John Phillip Law's innocent, country like young soldier holds true to characterization. A delicate story handled with simplicity and honesty.",1286323200,5,354,5.454545454545454
3916444,5,B002EAYEBU,"This was a very difficult movie to locate.  However, this seller had this movie available.  I would recommend this seller to anyone who would want to purchase online. The movie is in excellent condition.",1253318400,,203,4.9411764705882355
3916448,5,B002EAYEBU,One of the many GERAT Movies that Mr. Steiger had a lead role in. His acting was superb all the way through. Just goes to show that he was one of the all time greats...,1396310400,3,168,3.8285714285714287
3916449,5,B002EAYEBU,This is Steigers second greatest...second to  Pawnbroker.  John Philip Laws (#arbarella) was a fine coupling. It has been very hard to get even on VHS. So glad to have this on DVD. A must have for serious fans.,1377820800,4,210,4.5
3916450,5,B002EAYEBU,"Rod Steiger did an excellent performance in this very early exposure of a man's
suppressed desires and the target ending that can ensue from same.",1366329600,2,146,4.88
3916451,5,B002EAYEBU,"Steiger plays the man's-man rough and tough Sergeant who is struggling with his sexuality. He is quite attracted to a young soldier (Law), and keeps trying to get close to him, physically and emotionally. Finally he has the guts to open up about his feelings. It doesn't end well. Good movie!",1362787200,3,292,4.745098039215686

3916453,5,B002EAYEBU,"This is one of his least known films,but certenly one of his best!! Its not a picture you would imagine him doing,but as one of our great,late character actors it's pulled off classicly. The other actors are not the greatest or maybe they are and Steiger overshadows them!!!In any event ""A MUST SEE!!""  Conrad",1349913600,,309,4.722222222222222

3916455,4,B002EAYEBU,"This film breaks the stereotype. The pretty boy is the hetrosexual that gets the girl, and it's the old rugged war hero who is the one who waks on the other side of the street. Great scene between the 'macho' but troubled sergeant and the girl friend.",1322352000,2,251,4.361702127659575
3916456,5,B002EAYEBU,An older movie that can fit into todays's headlines about gays in the military. Mild with sexual overtones that leads into confrontations and suicide. Rod Steiger stars.,1303776000,,169,5.296296296296297
3916457,5,B002EAYEBU,"This late 60's movie was probably the first movie to meantion Homosexuality in the US Army. It was a brave movie for an actor to take on such a role, even to-day they shy aware from movies which such gay themes. Not much changes does it, everone is 'Afaid' of gay men and women in the military because it disrupts moral.",1297036800,3,320,4.262295081967213

8367084,1,B002EAYEBU,This was scripted and shot at about the level of a bad Movie of the Week. I felt that viewing it as a social artifact was time wasted.,1492646400,,134,3.8214285714285716
8367085,5,B002EAYEBU,"This is a great movie with Rod Steiger doing a fantastic  job with the part.  He is very believable as a conflicted, tortured man who has always excelled professionally, but has had a troubled personal life.  I saw this movie many years ago, and bought it recently because I remembered how gripping the characters were, and how they dealt with their problems in the context of the times (just after World War II).  I encountered one minor issue with the disk.  My DVR gave a message ""This disk is unsupported,""  but when I clicked on ""play"" the movie played with no apparent problem.",1457740800,,583,4.611650485436893
8367086,3,B002EAYEBU,"Purchased this because of Rod Steiger, whom I have come to realise has a wide range of acting ability. One of his scenes, where he is stripped of command, is in my opinion worthy of Academy Award status. Not a feel good movie but worth seeing due to lessons in human nature.",1456963200,,274,4.288461538461538

8367088,5,B002EAYEBU,"Master Sergeant Albert Callan (Rod Steiger) is one tough G.I. During World War II, he killed an enemy soldier with his bare hands. Now in postwar France, he wrests control of his army post away from an ineffective superior. But another Sergeant Callan lives behind the snarl and the stare: a man overwhelmed by his repressed attraction to a handsome young private (John Phillip Law). In this insightful exploration of homosexuality made in an era of widespread intolerance. This is the story. This is primarily a 2 man movie and both of these men are not only perfect but exquisite in these roles. Rod Steiger is amazing as you can see him fighting himself and the attraction he feels for John, he takes him from the gas pool and makes him his assistant. Just to have him near. His torment at this time is evident. John Philip Law, tall, handsome and a killer smile, is unaware of what is going on, even when his Sergeant continues to try to sabotage his relationship. I won't say more but the outstanding story and nuances from both me are well worth the price of admission.",1449187200,2,1075,4.604166666666667
8367089,5,B002EAYEBU,"This movie was good, really good.  I love Rod Steiger- he is so intense as an actor.  The theme of this film- a man struggling with his homosexuality was a bold move for Steiger.",1438300800,2,178,4.205882352941177
