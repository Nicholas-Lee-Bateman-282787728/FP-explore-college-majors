5321902,5,B009DTI3FS,I really loved it. I have about five versions of La Boheme and found this a nice change in the presentation. The setting and use of modern day venues working .The singing of course is where it all hapoens and with Anna Netrebko as Mimi how could one go wrong. If you are as I am a fan of Puccini and Netrebko then I say buy it. This the type of change Callas said needed to be done to productions so it isn't just he same old production over and over again.,1356048000,10,457,3.9782608695652173
5321923,3,B009DTI3FS,"I also bought the 1982 DVD starring Teresa Stratus, Carreras, and Scotto just so I could compare the two, especially seeing they are very different. Now I'm a big fan of Anna Netrebko so I figured it couldn't be as bad as some reviews were saying.  Well, maybe this version wasn't as bad, but for me, it definitely was not as good or as moving as the 1982 performance. If you are looking to spend your money on just one La Boheme, I think you are better off purchasing the other one. But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?",1370736000,,547,4.20952380952381
5321924,1,B009DTI3FS,"Anna Netrebko, Piotr Beczala, and Nino Machaidze, are at the top of my list as singers/performers. One would hardly expect that these three superstars would congregate to put out such a shoddy product.  The best the promoters can say about this DVD is ""This Boheme was the talk of the 2012 Salzburg Festival....""  I can imagine what the talk was about.  So much for Salzburg!  I borrowed this DVD, and I am not buying it.  Stick with La Scala, the Met, or the ROH.  The odds are far better.

The Boheme to get is the one from La Scala, starring Cristina Gallardo-Domas, Marcelo Alvarez, and Franco Zeffirelli. It is excellent in every aspect: vocally, artistically, and technically.  Cristina is fabulous.  Thanks to Amazon, the price is unbeatable.  One cannot afford not to buy it.",1365552000,10,783,4.776119402985074
5321925,2,B009DTI3FS,Some operas don't adapt well to modern times and this is definitely one of them although the voices are superb.,1364688000,,111,4.6
5321926,4,B009DTI3FS,"The story is quickly told. Rodolfo falls in love with Mimi as she enters the room. It is the Christmas Eve and he celebrates a meagre feast with his companion. No income and not able to pay the rent. Mimi collects some fire at Rodolfo and he goes with her to his friends. She is unable to survive the next spring, as a result of her illness. Anna Netrebko sings it very good. Her voice is in the right proportion for Puccini. Her timbre shines in a warm sound. One of her highlights are the arias ""Mi chiamano Mim&igrave;"" and "" D'onde lieta usc&igrave;"". Her duet with Rodolfo is one of the most sung arias in the opera world (O soave fanciulla). Piotre Beczala convince with ""Che gelida manina"". Another highlight is Nino Machaidze. Her voice had a beautiful coloratura and her aria ""Quando men vo"" is the best aria in the opera. The opera is musically sound, as it was in the production of 2008. but the pictures are not so good as in the film version with Anna Netrebko.
The production shows the Paris of today. It had reminiscence of the persons receiving welfare aid. It is a uncommon picture but rooted in the soil of today's life.",1364083200,2,1138,4.423809523809524
5321927,3,B009DTI3FS,"The music and singing was great.  Anna Netrebko was fantastic.  I really missed having subtitles, however. The arias are lovely, but when I can't follow the dialogue something is missing.",1363046400,2,187,5.2
5321928,5,B009DTI3FS,"Normally I do not like operas ""modernized"" (this one to 2012), but this version works.  There are some problems in this updating -- for instance, in the subtitles.  The great Russian soprano Anna Netrebko does not have ""blue eyes"" and Nino Machaidze, who plays Musetta, does not have ""dark eyes"".  Why not switch these colors so they match the actual eye colors?  Plenty of other changes have been made, both in the subtitles and in the staging of the opera.  Nitpicks aside, this is a wonderful treat;  Netrebko and Polish tenor Piotr Beczala are excellent, the rest of the cast very good, the second act is very colorful, and the ending when Mimi dies is heart-rending.  I have three other versions of this opera, including the outstanding cinematic production of 2008 starring Netrebko and Villazon.  This one is a worthy addition.",1358812800,9,834,4.865248226950355
5321929,5,B009DTI3FS,Gift for my husband--he loved it.  He especially liked the company that was in the dvd. great gift for opera lovers,1358294400,2,115,4.476190476190476
5321930,4,B009DTI3FS,Singing was of course great acting tremendous take off one star for the following the rent like costumes just didn't work for me . And the toymaker flying around the stage like radarman was just plain silly,1357862400,,206,4.594594594594595
5321931,4,B009DTI3FS,"I will simply comment on the current two reviews.  I have no problem with Netrebko's performance.  In fact, I was swept away by her earlier performance under de Billy, who pushed the production with a contagious urgency.  To some extent I miss that vitality in this current version, but in listening to Gatti's conducting I am impressed by the way he brings out the lyric aspects of the score--and this is a very lyric opera.  I am frequently struck by the shear beauty of the music, perhaps more often than when listening to De Billy.  I just listen, and so never bother to watch these Blu-ray operas, so I can't say anything about what is going on outside of the singer's mouths.",1357084800,2,681,4.549180327868853
5321932,1,B009DTI3FS,"If you have seen hundreds of La Boheme and now want to experiment with a modernistic production where the director takes too many artistic liberties of questionable intelligence then buy this DVD. But if you know the details of the score and the libretto and you have already educated your taste by listening to glorious productions of this opera (Pavarotti & Cotrubas; Alagna & Gheorghiu, etc), then I think you will find this DVD an ill-advised investment of time and money.

To my mind, a production should be recorded only if it adds something memorable, while also respecting the composer's intentions. I am struggling to find things worth remembering about this production. In theory, Anna's voice type should be suited for Mimi, but her dramatic and vocal characterisation of Mimi is unremarkable and somewhat bland. Her pronunciation and phrasing are particularly frustrating. Piotr is a fair choice for Rodolfo, but again, what is memorable about his Rodolfo?

I fear that we enter a new age where recording is getting so cheap and ubiquitous that the market will be cluttered with productions that do not really merit the eternal life afforded by technology...",1356307200,33,1170,5.088541666666667

8540466,5,B009DTI3FS,it was just as great as I remember it.,1502064000,,38,3.3333333333333335
8540467,5,B009DTI3FS,"This is a first rate version of everyone's favorite opera with excellent performances by all of the cast, especially Netrebko.  Beczala might not make listeners forget Pavarotti or Bjorling, but  he is very, very good and a fine partner for Netrebko. Their performances of the two big arias in the first act are beautiful,  and their duet ""O soave fanciulla"" captures Puccini's romantic vision in all of its glory.  The staging is contemporary Paris, and for me it contributes to the enjoyment of the opera..  I like this version even better than the Met production with Gheorghiu and Vargas, although the singing is terrific in both productions.  I am frequently put off by updated or otherwise unusual staging that undercuts the singing, but when it works, it works.  And it works here.  Highly recommended.",1471046400,,809,4.985074626865671
8540468,5,B009DTI3FS,"Ok not great sets, but the voices. All of them, rate super high.  How nice to see relatively normal aged actors in the part.",1462665600,,124,4.166666666666667
8540469,5,B009DTI3FS,ok Netrebko is amazing. ho hum.  no kidding she is terrific in the role of Mimi.,1452643200,,80,4.0
8540470,1,B009DTI3FS,"I don't understand how I failed, before buying it, to see that this is not even close to a traditional Boh&egrave;me but, rather, an insult to Puccini.
 Instead of the garret, at the turn of the 19th century, we open on a street scene, where they are living under a highway overpass, in what appears to be the early 2000s. Marcello is a photographer (not a painter) and the Rodolfo is pushing a supermarket shopping cart, while digging through the trash, for bottles and cans, to be able to recover the deposit values.
  I bougth this, just on the cast list. My grievous error.
 Dont waste your money, unless you enjoy Euro-trash.

Supplemented review:
  I had to watch this, a second time, to see if I could get through more than just the first few minutes. I did get through it, fast forwarding much of it.

 Revisionist, Euro-trash is better than this.

 Supermarket shopping carts seem to loom, large, in this presentation. Many of the characters use them, for whatever purpose happens to exist, at the moment.

 Those familiar with this opera know that Mimi makes her appearance, at the door of Rodolfo, to have her candle relit, since its allegedly been blown out, by a draft, in her apartment. In this version, Mimi comes to Rodolfos door to relight......wait for it......her cigarette!!! She makes her entarnce, in full Goth gear: jet-black hair, cut, sharply, black eye liner, black makeup, black, leather jacket, miniskirt, ankle-length, black, high-heeled boots and multiple body tatoos.

 The whole presentation goes downhill, from there. I don't know if the cause of this was the direction they received or if their voices were just not there, that day. No one, especially Netrebko, was even close to excellent. Overall, I would give the quality of singing a B+, at best.

 Much of the time, what you see, as scenery (and Im using that word VERY loosely) has nothing to do with the opera or even whats allegedly taking place, on stage.

 Dont waste your money, unless you enjoy something which makes even Euro-trash look good.",1445212800,5,2039,4.807471264367816

8540472,1,B009DTI3FS,"Well the Netrebko although I prefer the film version with Villanzon. Beczala sings bad. Quite insane the modern ambientation that manages to make ridiculous a marvelous work, Discouraged",1395619200,2,186,5.678571428571429
8540473,1,B009DTI3FS,When I opened the package the case was cracked on the upper right side. I haven't watched the Bluray yet but I was unimpressed with that the quality pf the prpduct they sent me.  I'm probably not going to order DVDs from Amazon anymore.,1391731200,,236,4.363636363636363
