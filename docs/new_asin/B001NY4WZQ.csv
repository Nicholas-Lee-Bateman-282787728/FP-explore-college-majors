8328331,5,B001NY4WZQ,"this movie was not nick cannons best to me I did not like it that much, in fact this was one of his earlier films and to me it really shows a lot.",1379116800,2,146,3.4545454545454546
8328332,4,B001NY4WZQ,"I was shocked the first time that I saw the clips on Youtube.  Never heard of it before that.  The music for the Sundance version was a few steps better as it had Houston musical influences.  It almost feels like a documentary at times.  Seeing Nick Cannon in his role is interesting but it still works.

Shipper got it to me quickly.  Not much of a wait.  Tieuel Legacy!",1309651200,3,371,4.2898550724637685
8328333,4,B001NY4WZQ,"Now, you might be wondering what the hell this movie is about. Weapons, but do not mistake guns and knives as the plot--the true weapons are the characters themselves.

Showing the turning-point of urban society, the film opens up with Cannon getting his head blown off. Yes, within the first few seconds of delving into his delicious burger, Cannon's character bites the dust. Don't fret, though. It actually leads us into a ""Pulp Fiction""-esque plot.

A rapist, a drug-addict, a nobody, a hot-head, a rebel. These are the characters we are introduced to within the first half of the film--all of them confused, angry, and broken.

I will not detail much of the plot; however, I will say that the film is a must-see! I love dramas, and this one actually competed in the 2007 Sundance Grand Jury competition for BEST DRAMATIC FEATURE. Excellent performances by Cannon, Dano, and Smith--all who settle into the darkness within their powerful characters.",1303776000,3,952,4.9748427672955975
8328334,1,B001NY4WZQ,"I saw the preview for this movie and i decided to purchase it.
Wow! How i was disappointed. I can't believe that *NICK CAMERON*
starred in such a WACK film. Don't waist your money.
Everybody walked around in the entire movie looking like they were
having a bad hair day. The acting, casting, and scenory was very poor.
This movie should be off the market WACKKKKKKK!!!!!",1269907200,,370,4.621212121212121
8328335,5,B001NY4WZQ,"This movie was good...great from beginning to end.  In the beginning it really creeps you out but...its all understood as the movie goes on.  Nick Cannon is awesome in this... infact, Nick Cannon is pretty dope in all of his movies... alot of folks sleep on him.  But Indie films are where it's at, and this one has a great plot to it. Def. a must see. :)",1250899200,4,355,4.1911764705882355
