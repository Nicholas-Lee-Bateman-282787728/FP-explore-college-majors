8058703,3,B0009A2BJE,"A ""ghost-writer"" Raphael fulfils his dream to publish a book under his own name by collecting enough data from his famous clients he had been writing biographies for while fooling around with their partners and fathering own boy.

From context, it is a very poor DVD itself - no extras.",1194134400,,286,4.72
8058704,5,B0009A2BJE,"I saw this film at a private screening in Paris with the director and other American students.  It was hilarious and very stylistic in it's narration.

The director/writer, Laurent Tirard, studied film at NYU and so to the French, his homor is perceived as being very American (!?!).  Check it out...it's worth your time!",1187654400,,388,4.7611940298507465
