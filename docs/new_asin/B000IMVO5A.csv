8146407,5,B000IMVO5A,"I produced this DVD in Israel because they are the exercises that saved my back 10 years ago.  At that time, I had 3 bulging disks: 1 cervical, 1 thorasic and 1 lumbar.  It really wasn't fun!  And then I met Lily Cohen, a Tai Chi/QiGong Master from Israel, who was in NYC on holiday!  After doing some of her core exercises for only one month, I was noticing that my pain level had been reduced.  Eventually, my Chiropractor was sorry to see me go (after 3 x's a week visits!), but he was amazed at the results I had gotten from the exercises.  The rest of the story is that 10 years later I am continuing to live pain free...and have the x-rays to prove that all those disks returned to their proper places.  Another Miracle from the Holy Land?  Well, yes!",1234483200,,757,4.244755244755245

Ho, Ho, Ho.  But, seriously, folks, everthing except Rudolph is true!  I LOVE THIS DVD, and that's why I produced it!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazing-Stress-Solutions-For-Small-Spaces/dp/B000IMVO5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazing Stress Solutions For Small Spaces</a>",1199404800,,535,6.955223880597015
