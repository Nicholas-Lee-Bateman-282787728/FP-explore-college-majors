THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE (1959) is terribly underrated at IMDb, perhaps due to its lampooning in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-6-of-MST3K/dp/B001XW7ICC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 6 of MST3K</a>.

Cheesecake lovers will drool over several languid shots of a few shapely gals (including a bathtub scene), and the two males leads are certainly easy on the eyes, ladies! Jack Elam's heavy is spot-on perfect until he fails to deliver the goods in a final teary ""I did it"" confession.

PLOT--
Two drifters become friends and also romance a couple of small-town girls. A local creepazoid has the hots for one of the women. As she visits Lovers Lane alone and laments her sweety's imminent departure for places unknown, the lurking gargoyle attacks and kills her. Naturally our ""stranger"" is accused of the crime. A lynch mob besieges the jail where he's being held, and the girl's father intends to beat him to perdition.

I enjoyed watching this movie, bad dialogue and all. It's surely no classic but ""Girl in Lover's Lane"" is far from a turkey!",1359331200,,2839,7.590909090909091
7988326,1,B00008ZL5A,"The Girl in Lovers' Lane: 3 out of 10: Homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon. Plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover's Lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope. In fact, it is so blatant and over the top even MST3K, whom rarely notes such things in their riffing, simply cannot avoid it.

The film is about two drifters. One a rich kid (Lowell Brown) running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts, the other is a professional hobo (Brett Halsey). The hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner, a pool hall and a whorehouse. Our drifter scholar gets a second look from the diner's waitress (Joyce Meadows as the titular Girl in Lovers Lane) who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy Jack Elam doing a Steve Buscemi impression.

On the surface, this seems like a strange film for the MST3K treatment. While the cast are to old for the characters they are playing, the acting is actually pretty good with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam giving solid performances. The story is slight, but hardly The Robot vs. Aztec Mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot, but relatively competent.

It is the strange Batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious. Halsey's over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to commit to the waitress (or at the least get past first base) are telling, and the dozens of glances between him and the kid; a hand on shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other. You don't have to be Freud to figure out this undercurrent.

""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" The Girl in Lovers' Lane (Season 6, Episode 9): 9 out of 10: I am not sure this film would be funny on its own, but with the Joel and the robots it is a hilarious classic. This is simply some of the best non-stop riffing of the Joel years and one of the best overall episodes. I am shocked how well this movie works as MST3K material. It is well worth the watch for MST3K veterans and newbies alike.",1259366400,,2297,4.461904761904762

7988329,4,B00008ZL5A,"Ah yes, the timeless story of two strangers from different worlds falling in love before they're able to cope with it.  Okay, so maybe it's not Romeo and Juliet, but Girl in Lover's Lane does at least follow the major elements of the old Shakespearean tale.  Drifter Bix runs into rich, sheltered runaway Danny, and the two pick a random town to settle in for a while.  Bix has no idea that this is the place where he'll meet the girl of his dreams Carrie, and Danny has no idea that this is the place where he'll meet his first sleazy prostitute.

Bix loves Carrie dearly, but he knows he's not good enough for her.  He's just a lowly drifter, and doesn't know anything else but drifting.  The complication of Carrie in his life is too much for the poor dope.

While all this mess is going on Carrie's being stalked by Jesse, the town weirdo.  He sees her with Bix, and he don't like it one bit.  So he goes crazy and kills poor Carrie, and she dies in Bix's arms.  Oh, how can such drama ever be resolved?  The movie finds a way, but it's too bad the crucial confession scene is so botched.

I love this movie, even though certain things like unpolished visual transitions squeezed it into the Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies-to-make-fun-of library.  Their name for Bix was Big Stupid, and I guess that's what I'll always call him.",1169251200,4,1337,4.430327868852459

While drifting through a small town, Bix ( Halsey) becomes involved with local tease Carrie ( Joyce Meadows). Shortly afterward, Carrie is murdered, and Bix is held responsible. The actual killer is feeble-minded Jesse ( Jack Elam), but the villagers aren't as quick on the uptake as the movie audience. Only the intervention of runaway youngster Danny ( Lowell Brown) saves Bix from a lynch mob. Girl in Lover's Lane was directed by another TV habitue, Charles R.
