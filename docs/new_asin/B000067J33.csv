You can tell its older, Which stems my complaints: I really wish they would have had more songs from Litany on this DVD. Let me be correct, there is songs from litany on here, but its on the bootleg bonus stuff which has such terrible picture and sound quality you will never watch it! I guess Im a guy that was more familiar with Vader's newer stuff when I bought this, so I was expecting much more, it is more rough / deathier than their newer stuff (they are still death metal, but anyone that hears old and new Vader knows what I mean.) Anyway, 4 stars for their litany album, and only 3 for this.",1047427200,2,764,4.1
