8185473,3,B0002KPIIC,"I have the other Fred Sokolow ""Tin Pan Alley"" books/DVDs.  They sent me the wrong book, one that I already owned.  I assume this one is as good as the other ones, which are overall good quality.  My only complaint is that Sokolow leaves out a lot of the song parts.  He could give a little more help on variations, and some introductions are completely missing, and it's really hard to pick them up watching him play them at regular speed.",1407456000,2,439,4.382716049382716
