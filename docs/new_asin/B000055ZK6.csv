The 6 Man Hell in A Cell match is amazing.  Those 6 man basically destory each other.  Chris Jericho/Kane in a Last Man Standing Match is also good. There is also 6 Man Tag, 4 Corners Tag Title Match, Women's Triple Threat, European and Intercontential  Title matches and Chyna faces RTC member Val Venis.

1395067,5,B000055ZK6,"To start off this is 1 of the best if not the best ppv. 8 incredible matches from begging to end. 1st It starts off with Radicals vs. The Hardys & Lita. Great opener with high flying moves. 2nd Regal vs. Hardcore for the european belt. I will put it this way it was a better match than the one at Survior Series. 3rd Val Venus vs. Chyna. Not the best from these 2 competiters but very enjoyable. 4th Last Man Standing Y2J vs Kane. I love this match it showed that Y2J was a tough SOB.5th 4 Corners Match for the Tag Team Belts Edge & Christian,The Dudleys,RTC,Road Dogg & K-Kwik. Fast paced, very exciting, and alot of tag team moves. 6th Benoit vs. Billy Gunn for IC belt. Very good 1 on 1 match but I hated when Benoit locked on the crippler crossface. 7th Triple Threat for Womens title Ivory vs. Trish vs. Molly Holly. I can summerize this match in 1 word PUPPIES.8th and the best Hell In A Cell for WWF belt Kurt vs. ABA vs. HHH vs. The Rock vs. Rikishi vs. Stone Cold. I can't even describe this match it's so awsome it has to be the match of the year. Hell In A Cell, Last Man Standing, 5 titles on the line, The top WWF superstars.

Mankind vs Undertaker

Kane vs Mankind
Triple H vs Jerico..
Brock Lesnar Vs Undertaker
Kevin Nash Vs Triple H

I thought This Hell in the Cell was one of the best but not ""THE BEST""

Hardys & Lita V Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn
Pretty good opener to the show with some cool moves. Dean sucks though. 7/10
European Championship - Hardcore Holly V William Regal
An alright match but nothing special. Raven interferes in the match. Not enough action to keep interesting. 5/10
Chyna V Val Venis
This was a load of crap and RTC sucked badly. The end is stupid too. 3/10
Last Man Standing - Chris Jericho V Kane
This was a pretty good match but it went wrong in various places. First off they go backstage, but there are camera problems and you can't see some of it. Back in the ring the match is quite good, and Jericho uses a chair a few times. After a while though the match really starts to drag. Later Jericho tries to put Kane through a table but it won't break! The end is quite good though. 7/10
Four Corners Tag Team Championship - Edge & Christian V Bull Buchanan & Goodfather V Road Dogg & K-Kwik V Dudleys
A decent enough tag match, but the rules are pretty weird as they can tag anyone not just their partner because only 2 people are in the ring at once. RTC loose the belts, but to E&C not the Dudleys. 6/10
Intercontinental Championship - Billy Gunn V Chris Benoit
This was supposed to be a push for Gunn to become a main-eventer again, but it didn't work as he didn't put in enough effort. 6/10
Women's Championship - Molly Holly V Trish Stratus V Ivory
This was too high on the card.  At least it was short because no one cared they just wanted to get on to the main event. 4/10
WWE Championship Hell in a Cell - Kurt Angle V Triple H V The Rock V The Undertaker V Stone Cold Steve Austin V Rikishi
This was an incredible match and a brilliant way to end the year. By the end everyone is busted open except for Rikishi. Vince comes in with a truck and rips the door off the cell. Austin is put through a car window and Rock is pedigreed on a car. The spot of the match though is Undertaker chokeslamming Rikishi of the top of the cell onto a truck below. The only bad thing about this match is the abrupt ending. One of the best matches I've ever seen. 10/10

Team x-treme vs. the radicalz-I loved some of the high-flying action in this but it was kinda dull with how easy it was to pin Matt and Lita showed a great comeback to Dean but didn't make the cut
William Regal(c) vs. Hardcore Holly, European championship-some nice technical wrestling and I guess 1 or 2 hard hits but it really didn't need raven interupting
Chyna vs. Val Venus(w/Ivory)-*-just an add in to fill the ppv and a dumb ending
Last man standing-Kane vs. Jerico-*1/2-great match loved it great performance by Jerico and Kane but the one guy getting punched around was kinda stupid and the ending was so fake if you tipped barrels over theyed all fall but not together you could tell there was something keeping them together
fatal four tag,championship-Right to censor(c)vs. Dudleys vs.
r-dog & K-kwik vs. Edge & Cristian-*1/2- this match for the most part was good fast paced and alot of tag team manovers but another dumb ending that just reaked of stupidness to Edge & Cristian
IC title-Billy gun vs. Chris Beniot-****-great technical match but with alot of boring spots had to watch it a few times to actually catch all of it
Women's championship-Trish vs. Ivory(c) vs. Molly Holly-1/2*-Dumb pathetic match I mean and another pathetic ending horrible I would have given a better rating to this ppv if it defenatly didn't have this match

Infact, I just recently sold mine in a carport sell. You would think that by putting six of the WWF's top stars into the most brutal match ever that you'd have a classic. But this match was definetly not a classic. Rikishi gets chokeslammed off the cage and lands in the back of a truck full of soft woodchips or something. That was stupid. Anybody can do that! Heck, I can do that! A child can take a 12 ft. fall into the back of a truck filled with hay/woodchips and still walk away without a scratch! Come on, folks! Let's face it, this match was too long and way too boring. Don't buy this boring video. Just rent it. It lacked in blood & gore, and most of the blood was actually corn syrup.

Match 1: Team Xtreme vs. The Radicalz in Elimination Rules - this elimination match was very fast paced and I wish one day we can all these atheletes in like a 20-25 min classic but no we get an 8-min face pasted one, but still not terrible Rating: ***
Match 2: European Champion William Regal vs. Hardcore Holly - bleh match, didn't serve a purpose at all Rating: DUD
Match 3: Chyna vs. Val Venis - Val Venis is so awesome and it's a low down dirty shame that he is facing a skank like Chyna, I wish one day he will be pushed into better matches like in late 1999, ... match in which Val wins with a Seaman's Plex Rating: *
Match 4: Kane vs. Chris Jericho - I'm not a big fan of last man standing matches, but i do know to leave it to HHH and Y2J and not Kane and Y2J, disapointing Rating: **1/4
Match 5: Tag Team Champions The Right To Censor vs. Road Dogg & KKwik vs. E&C vs. The Dudleyz in a Fatal 4-way - now this one was pretty good but I could have lived without the ending which see Edge blast Bubba with a title belt to win the match Rating: ***1/3

1395141,4,B000055ZK6,"Armageddon was not the best PPV of 2000 but gave the 6 top performers in the WWF a chance to beat the crap out of each other.
1. Hardyz+Lita VS Radicalz: Great 6 man elimination match with all 6 competitors delivering. Eddie really deserves a push again into the IC belt.
2. Regal VS Hardcore Holly, European title: Regal is a great interview but he sucks at taking bumps. I think its Ravens debut run-in but I cant quite remember but he Evenflows Holly.
3. Chyna VS Val Venis: Val really didn't deserve to be paired with Chyna.
4. Jericho VS Kane, Last Man Standing: Nowhere near as good as Jericho/HHH at Fully Loaded but showcased both competitors fighting spirit.
5. Dudleyz VS Road Dogg/K-Kwikk VS RTC VS Edge and Christian, Tag titles: Sleeper of the show as soon as Road Dogg and K-Kwikk are eliminated and i think a certain leader of RTC gets put thru a table.
6. Billy Gunn VS Chris Benoit, IC Title: Average match by Benoits standards. Shows Billy Gunn did not desereve his push and should just go back to the New Age Outlaws with Road Dogg.
7. Molly Holy VS Trish VS Ivory, womens title: Trish is ace but ivory should just drop the title to Chyna.
8. Angle VS Taker VS Austin VS Rock VS Triple H VS Rikishi, Hell In A Cell, WWF Title: Not the best HIAC but KOTR 1998 would be hard to beat let alone No Way Out 2000. Anyway, all 6 men were bloodied and battered by the end which is essential in a HIAC match. I still would have liked to see Taker win it though after that amazing chokeslam from the top of the cell.

1395142,5,B000055ZK6,"1. Inter Gender Tag Team Elimination Match with Hardy Boyz & Lita vs. Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn
This was an excellant match that had some of the hardyz high flying aerial assult but I was most impresed with Lita who showed excellant effort when she was fighting deam malenko, She was doing better moves than almost any superstar can do.
2. European Championship Hardcore Holly vs. William Regal
This was the slepper of the night but it was better than there last match at survivor seris, both competitors did pull of some good submissions but there wasint enough action. This match includes a run in by Raven.
3. Chyna vs. Val Venis
This was a competitor for the slepper of the night but sence Chyna took some power moves it makes it a bit better than the Europien match.
4. Last Man Standing Chris Jericho vs. Kane
This was a pretty good match, it had some hardcore action but not that much, it gets kind of slow because it looks that kane gets tired in the middle of the match, at one point a table didn't break after jericho tried to drive kane threw it so he tried to put him threw again but it still would not brake the second time. This match has a good ending when jericho pushes down a part of the super structure on top of kane.
5. Four Corners Tag Team Championship Edge & Christian vs. Bull Buchanan & Goodfather vs. Road Dogg & K-Kwik vs. Dudley Boyz
This was a great tag team match that has lots of the wrestlers signature moves. Of course steve richards interfered and gave a DDT to Devon onto a table that was not set up, Over all it was one of the best tag team matches but does not compete with the Wrestlemania or Summerslam ladder matches.
6. Intercontinental Championship Billy Gunn vs. Chris Benoit
This match was going to be a push for Billy but he just did not show enough effort to become an intercontental champion. This was a good match but it was a very slow passed.
7. Triple Threat Women's Championship Molly Holly vs. Trish Stratus vs. Ivory
This was a very short match but thats a good thing because the match was typical and obviouses of who was going to win, it did have some aerial manauvers by molly but it wasint her best.
8. Hell in a Cell WWF Championship Kurt Angle vs. Triple H vs. The Rock vs. The Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Rikishi
This was for sure the match of the night and maybe the match of the year where 6 of the top WWF superstars meet in one match that has never let a man leave uninjured, HELL IN A CELL, I think at the end of the match every superstar was busted open and every superstar got ther signature move in. Steve Austin got put threw a car window but the spot of the night was when Undertaker Chokeslamed Rikishi off the 16 foot hell in a cell and onto a truck!
All together this is one of the best PPV ever done by the WWF and had all the hardcore, technical and aerial moves youll need to see to satisfy you. OVERALL RATING 8.5/10",989625600,,2928,4.287003610108303

1395144,5,B000055ZK6,"Armageddon was definately worth the purchase. However, most may say that this ppv was a bit dull, due to the low amounts of action involved. What really gets this event my high ranking is mainly the historic six man Hell in a Cell for the WWF Championship. A great match, and the most entertaining of all listed on the card. The other great matches are the European Championship battle, and the four corners Tag Team Championship. The matches and review for each are as follows:
1. Inter Gender Tag Team Elimination Match Hardy Boyz & Lita vs. Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn
A great match, but a predictable ending.
2. European Championship Hardcore Holly vs. William Regal
Definately better than their match at Survivor Series. One of the top of the night. Features interference from Raven.
3. Chyna vs. Val Venis
Absolutely the most stupidest and dullest match on the card.
4. Last Man Standing Chris Jericho vs. Kane
A good match, but way too long. Kane really seems kind of weak on this contest. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.
5. Four Corners Tag Team Championship Edge & Christian vs. Bull Buchanan & Goodfather vs. Road Dogg & K-Kwik vs. Dudley Boyz
Although it may upset some for Edge & Christian's victory, it was probably one of the best matches of the year, but doesn't contend with the TLC match at Summerslam.
6. Intercontinental Championship Billy Gunn vs. Chris Benoit
Alright match, but not one to sit through again.
7. Triple Threat Women's Championship Molly Holly vs. Trish Stratus vs. Ivory
Typical Women's title match. Nothing special. Ends quick.
8. Hell in a Cell WWF Championship Kurt Angle vs. Triple H vs. The Rock vs. The Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Rikishi
Undoubtedly one of the greatest matches of the decade, though it did lack alot of blood and damage.
Even if you didn't like this ppv, you should get it anyway for nostalgia. They will probably never have these kind of matches again, so it's worth the price. Overall, a great way to end 2000.

7931432,5,B000055ZK6,"1.) Intergender Elimination Tag Team Match: Team Xtreme vs The Radicalz (Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, and Dean Malenko) w/Terri

This match came about after brewing tensions between the Hardyz and Dean Malenko---mainly Lita and Malenko was starting to boil over. In the weeks leading up to the PPV, Malenko had beat Lita in a match to win a date with her. On their date however, Lita humiliated Malenko, setting him up to be ambushed by the Hardyz in a hotel room. Malenko was looking for revenge, thus this match was signed. Saturn and Eddie start the match off, fighting with Matt and Jeff, while Malenko stalks Lita (who looked absolutely gorgeous with her periwinkle thong). A massive ""Eddie sucks"" chants breaks out in the opening minutes of the match, while The Radicalz work over Matt and Jeff. Eddie misses a hurricanrana off the top turnbuckle on Jeff and Lita takes advantage of the situation and plants Eddie with a Twist of Fate. Jeff capitalizes and hits the Swanton to eliminate Eddie. Jeff is eliminated almost seconds after. A missed Poetry In Motion leaves him open to a Death Valley Driver from Saturn who pins the rainbow haired warrior to eliminate him. The match is now evened with Matt and Lita against Saturn and Malenko. Saturn is next eliminated following a Twist of Fate from Matt. Terri enters the ring and smacks Matt only to get taken out by Lita. Malenko sneaks in the ring and rolls Matt up to eliminate him, leaving Malenko all alone with Lita for himself. Lita holds her own against Dean for the first couple minutes until Dean takes control with a superplex off the top turnbuckle. Malenko toys with Lita with several maneuvers and false pins before finally finishing her off with the Texas Cloverleaf for the win. Overall this was a fun opening match but the most logical option for this match would've been Malenko vs Lita but we'd get that rematch in the coming weeks

2.) WWF European Championship Match: William Regal (c) vs Hardcore Holly

Regal comes out and cuts a heel promo, insulting the Birmingham crowd, leading to the hometown hero coming out to get the match started. Yet again a boring match between Holly and Regal. Slightly better than the snoozefest they had the previous month at Survivor Series, but nothing worth checking out. Luckily this was a relatively short bout. The end comes with Raven interfering in the match and laying out Holly with a DDT while the referee was tending to Regal. Regal takes advantage and makes the pin for the win

3.) Chyna vs Val Venis w/Ivory

Chyna attacks Val on his way to the ring before throwing him inside to get the match underway. This was another short match but it was fairly adequate for the time it got with a decent back and forth pace. Val misses the Money Shot and Chyna attempts a move off the ropes, but Ivory grabs her foot, initiating a chase around the ring. The chase gives Val enough time to catch Chyna off guard with a Fisherman Suplex for the win. After the match, Chyna grabs Ivory back into the ring and attempts a powerbomb, but Venis intervenes and lays out Chyna with a spin-out powerbomb

  This was probably the last and only time until the main event you will hear the crowd tonight.  Good little match to open the night, I loved the ladies man dean melanko, very underrated wrestler too, same with saturn. Decent opener that did its job. Match rating 7/10.

Regal defeats Hardbore Holly for the European title.
  Holly had the home crowd behind him here in Alabama, somewhat better match then there wretched survivor series craptastic match... but really not by much.  Raven comes out and screws hardbore over.... why IDK but he probably wanted to end the misery of watching him wrestle (entertain?), go raven! Match Rating 5/10.

Val Venis defeats Chyna.
 I thought the RTC was actually a great heel stable.. just couldn't stand the entrance.. made me want to punch infants.  As for the match itself, if you do not black out, then consider yourself a winner.  Very dull match, like most Chyna matches. Poor Val very underrated, deserved better then this.  Match Rating 3/10.

Jericho defeats Kane in a Lastman Standing match.
 Talk about disapointing, I was really expecting this to steal the show.. it did the opposite.  (By the way, the Alabama crowd was absolutly horrible at this ppv here.. you suck alabama!) Anyways, a total one sided affair with Kane demolishing Jericho, till the last part of the match when Jericho crushed Kane with the barrels at the entrance way... which looked weaked bye the how.  Match Rating 5/10.

E&C defeats the Dudleyz, RTC, and the rapping idiots for the Tag titles.
  Here was another kinda disapointment here, I mean it wasent bad, I have seen a lot worse.  Just didn't seem to flow that well, plus it was lets beat up the K-kwik show (r-truth now little jimmy).  Plus E&C was becoming kinda redundant at this point winning all the time.  Dudleys should have won it. Match Rating 6/10.

Benoit (man who never existed ever, not even here) defeats Billy Gunn for the IC title.
  I loved this match for one reason.. It prooved that not even Jesus Christ could put Billy through a decent singles match.  Benoit really really tried here, but it was like watching him wrestle a wet sack of potatos.  Ugh I am gonna pass it cuz this was Billys last singles push thankfully.  Probably Benoits worst match on ppv, and none of it was his fault.  Match Rating 5/10.

  If you blinked, you would have missed this match.  The APA made there return to save little crash holly for test and albert, idk... Match rating 2/10.

Angle defeats Rock, Taker, Rikishi, Triple H, and Autin for the wwf title in a hell in a cell.
  Best match of the night and suprise of the night for me... I thought this was gonna be horrible quite honestly.  Turned out to be a fun little mess we had here.  The cell was used a lot, outside action, top of the cell action.  This would also be the last time someone was thrown from the top of the cell, rikishi was the one to take the ride (though it looked weaked im sure it still hurt like hell.) Saved the show from being a total failure of a show. Match Rating 8/10.

So basically this show gets a D grade from me, and came pretty close to failing.  The mid card was absolutly horrible, while the opening match and Main event basically held it up.  A one match show basically, don't get it.. also kudos to the art on the cover, very cool.",1308528000,,3425,4.520391517128874

Anyway it was the Hardys and Lita vs. The Radicalz (Malenko/Saturn/Guerrero).  Next up was Regal vs. Hardcore Holly for the now defunct European title.  Throw away match here considering they had a replica of their match from the previous month at Survivor Series.  Up next was another throw away storyline match with Val Venis (RTC Val not porno Val) vs. Chyna.  A slow paced but easy to watch last man standing match with Kane vs. Jericho.  A nice fatal four way match for the tag titles came next with Right to Censor vs. Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boys vs. Roaddogg & K-Kwik (R-Truth).  Billy Gunn put on a surprisingly good performance against Chris Benoit for the IC title despite getting spanked overall.  An easy to forget Women's title match was next with Ivory vs. Trish vs. Molly Holly. Finally came the six pack hell in a cell with Angle vs. Austin vs. Rock vs. HHH vs. Taker vs. Rikishi.  Everyone hits their big moves, action takes place on top, Rikishi takes a fall, Vince tries to stop the match and the fans are pissed at the ending.  Good times all around.  Overall the whole show wasn't bad with the last man standing and IC title matches holding their own but clearly everyone just wanted to see the hiac match.  Enjoy.",1294185600,,1370,4.592592592592593

Birmingham & Jefferson Civic Center

Birmingham, Alabama

Intergender Elmination Match:

Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero, & Perry Saturn V. Hardy Boyz & Lita

Good opener. The storyline between Lita & Dean was a little silly but Dean wins the match by eliminating Lita. ***

WWF European Championship:

William Regal (Champion) V. Hardcore Holly

Ok...not another Regal/Holly match. Oh...this match was better than there Survivor Series match. However, that's not really saying much. This match sucked and the cheap ending of Raven DDTing Holly for no reason and Regal winning. *1/4 Again, it's better than there Survivor Series match but I only give it a *1/4...that's sad...but pretty funny

Chyna V. Val Venis

umm...why put this garbage on PPV. At least the better man won in Val. * Wait...did I just call Chyna a man? Probably...and she isn't that good looking. So, why put he is Playboy...not once....but twice!. I think I'm going to throw up.

Last Man Standing Match:

Kane V. Chris Jericho

This match was a disappointment from where I sit. There wasn't that many weapons uses that all...actually...I think just a chair. Just big moves by Kane and Jericho winning by throwing barrels on Kane. ***

Four Corners Match for the WWF Tag Team Championship:

Bull Buchanan & The Goodfather (Champions) V. Edge & Christian V. Road Dogg & K-Kwik V. Dudley Boyz

This was the seond best match of the night...and that really doesn't mean anything. Good match that could have better. The ending had some great action. Edge & Christian wins the titles. ***1/2

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Billy Gunn (Champion) V. Chris Benoit

This match could have been the show stealer but fell way short. Benoit made this match wacthable and Gunn botched alot of stuff. Benoit wins the Intercontinental Title. ***

Triple Threat Match for the WWF Womens Championship:

Ivory (Champion) V. Molly Holly V. Trish

very short match that had very little action. I was watching Trish the whole time. Ivory retains. 1/2*

Six Pack Hell In A Cell Match for the WWF Championship:

Kurt Angle (Champion) V. The Rock V. Rikishi V. Stone Cold Steve Austin V. Undertaker V. Triple H

This was a very awesome match. JR was screaming the whole match. Some great spots and moves. The Austin/Rock staredown was great and the funs went nuts. Kyle, if you are reading this when you are skipping class...I agree with you on the stupid ending of Angle only putting a finger on Austin to retain...however, that cannot stop this match from being a Five-Star match. Sorry buddy. *****

Overall, it's an one match show and it's not hard to see that. Alot of matches could have stole the show but didn't. No matches in the four star range...but a five star Hell In A Cell Match makes this Pay-Per-View watchable.",1124236800,2,2811,4.90042372881356
7931437,3,B000055ZK6,"What happened here?  This lineup of matches looked like we were gonna have a good time (I first saw this live in December 2000).  What really hurts this PPV is that the heels win every match, but worse is that nothing really stands out when all is said & done.  Well, let's tackle this one.

Elimination Match
The Hardy Boyz & Lita vs. Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, & Dean Malenko
---I actually liked the hype that went into this match.  But considering that all six of these superstars have been in rougher bouts, the eliminations come very quickly.  It's fast-paced, plus I'm always a sucker for Elimination matches.  But it's way too short.  Entertaining, but I expected more from these six incredible performers.
""6.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

European Championship
William Regal (champion) vs. Hardcore Holly
---After Regal gives a hilarious in-ring promo and disses the Alabama crowd, Holly enters the ring.  Unfortunately, we then get a ""Survivor Series 2000"" encore.  It's not horrible, but very average.  Regal is doing his hardest to wrestle a good technical match, but the crowd just doesn't seem to care (odd considering Holly's from their homestate.)  Raven makes a sudden run-in, which is neat.  Overall, not much to say.
""5.5 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Chyna vs. Val Venis
---Get ready for the Right To Censor music...you'll be hearing it a lot.  I thought Chyna was a better brawler than people gave her credit, and Venis can sell movies very well.  Solid, but forgettable.
""6.0 out of 10""

***We now get a 10-15 minute promo where Vince McMahon begs the crowd to protest the Hell-In-A-Cell Match.  I actually liked this promo, even if it should've been an episode of ""RAW"", ""SmackDown"", or ""Heat"".  I dunno, you'll have to decide for yourself.***
________________________________________________

Last Man Standing Match
Kane vs. Chris Jericho
---Another ""Survivor Series 2000"" rematch, only with supposedly more brutal stipluations.  I was totally bored with this one.  As if the PPV match wasn't bad enough, Kane & Y2J are way off their game tonight.  It's not very violent or hardcore, and Kane practically dominates the whole thing.  Jericho literally can't answer a ref's 3-count at one point.  The ending is also unconvincing & cheesy.  Skip this one and watch Jericho-versus-Triple H at ""Fully Loaded 2000"", instead.
""4.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian vs. Bull Buchanan & The Goodfather (champions)
vs. Road Dogg & K-Kwik vs. The Dudley Boyz
---Not great, but each of the teams gets enough time to showcase their talent.  I don't know how this title bout got booked, but if you think of it like an all-star ballgame, you might like it.  Even though Dudleyz and E/C had classics earlier in the year, I can't complain too much.
""6.5 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Intercontinental Championship
Billy Gunn (champion) vs. Chris Benoit
---This s easily the best match on the card.  Benoit is a master technician, and Gunn is a capable performer.  In fact, this might be one of Gunn's best singles matches ever.  A good back-and-forth match with some neat counters and good mat wrestling.
""7.5 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Women's Championship
Molly Holly vs. Trish Stratus vs. Ivory (champion)
---This match is literally only 4 minutes, and is meant to whet our appetites for the main event.  Well, I mildly enjoyed myself, but overall a pointless cool-down contest.
""4.0 out of 10""

Hell-In-A-Cell Match for the WWF Championship
Triple H vs. Rikishi vs. Kurt Angle (champion)
vs. The Undertaker vs. The Rock vs. Stone Cold
---Alright, the moment we've all been waiting for.  Every participant got their own interviews and promos --- during the PPV, by the way --- to prove why they will leave the champ.  Arguably the six best superstars in the WWF get to battle it out in the most dangerous structure ever created.  So what do we get when the most violent, charismatic, technical, and determined performers get stuck in this Cell?  Sadly, a 20+ minute slugfest.  That's right: few neat spots, no tag action, little wrestling, and a high-spot that looks faker than it might've been.  This Cell match won't be added to the classic archives.  The door removal, Rikishi's infamous fall, and Undertaker's disappearance from the final minutes...all very convenient.  Just because everyone bleeds (unconvincingly) and pulls off their finishers doesn't mean it's an epic battle.  I kinda like it, but Cell matches have been much better than this.

OVERALL
There is no need to purchase ARMAGEDDON 2000.  Benoit/Gunn is a very good title bout, but you can see Benoit in better classics on better PPVs.  The Last Man Standing Match is a pathetic joke.  The Lita/Malenko storyine didn't really climax; their Elimination Match was a crowd-pleasing opener, nothing more.  This Hell-In-A-Cell Match is outclassed by almost every other Cell match to date, so SKIP IT.
You might like the PPV, but there's little reason to buy it, even you're a hardcore collector of all WWF/WWE Video.",1121472000,3,5353,5.3508982035928145
