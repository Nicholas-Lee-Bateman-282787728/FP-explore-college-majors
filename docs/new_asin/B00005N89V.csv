7946351,5,B00005N89V,"Although this isn't really billed as a Roger Corman collection he produced/directed 3 of the films and was executive producer on the fourth.
The 2 real gems are The Pit and the Pendulum and The Fall of the House of Usher both based on Edgar Allen Poe works and both starring Vincent Price in some of his best horror work. The other Corman Production is ""X"" The Man with the X-Ray Eyes starring Ray Milland. All three of these films have well done commentary by Corman.
The fourth film on which Corman was executive producer is The Dunwich Horror and stars Sandra Dee in something quite different from her Gidget and Tammy roles.
Other than the commentaries on the first three films the only other extras are theatrical trailers. All 4 films are in widescreen and all but The Pit and The Pendulum are enhanced for widescreen TVs. All 4 are made from very good quality masters.",1022630400,43,875,4.579617834394904
