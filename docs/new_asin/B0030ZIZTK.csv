4047865,4,B0030ZIZTK,"This is a dark and disturbing film about a love triangle that forms out of desperate necessity in wartime Poland, 1941. It is told from the perspective of Lisa Planck, loving mother of two girls, an aspiring cellist, and wife of a doctor.  She returns to her hometown in 1971, now a famous accomplished cellist, and seeks to reconcile her traumatic past.  This is done in a continuous series of flash-backs, with Lisa remembering the terrible pain of the past by seeing once again the people and settings of 30 years ago.  Her trip back is a chance to heal wounds and find peace.

The movie opens in occupied Poland, 1941.  Knowing that their city and home will be occupied by the Germans, a doctor (Joseph Fiennes), his wife Lisa (Katarzyna Al Abbas), and two children must seek immediate refuge in the countryside, as they are Jews, and the Germans are rounding up Jews and killing them.  They make a harrowing escape during the night, experience the ruthless, murderous Germans first-hand, and finally find refuge in the home of their grocer, a young widower named Emilia.  Emilia lost her husband in the war and is trying to eek out an existence on the farm.  She agrees to hide the Plancks, provided Lisa Planck and the children occupy the attic; the doctor, Artur Planck, is allowed to work the farm.  In short order, Emilia reveals her secret love for Dr. Planck, and the two begin an affair.  Artur Planck is caught in a love triangle that cannot end well; he must somehow conceal the affair from his wife who hides nearby in the attic.  The emotional strife of the two women eventually shatters the tenuous living arrangements and they are forced to separate.  On their own again, the Plancks must find another hiding place or risk capture and certain death by the Germans.

This film is quite disturbing on several levels.  The brutality of the Germans is horrific, as they murder civilian Jews without any hesitation.  And then there is the dark passions and jealousies of families forced together out of grave necessity.  The horror of the German occupation of Poland is vividly portrayed in this story.

The sets and characters are very believable.  The film captures the desperation of the citizens of occupied Poland and the daily struggle to survive.  The acting is first-rate, all central characters giving excellent performances.  This said, I could not give this film 5-stars, as there are certainly better war stories put to film, for example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Theatre-The-Diary-of-Anne-Frank/dp/B002I2PHLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hiding-Place-VHS/dp/1564080242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hiding Place [VHS</a>].

This is a good film, not great, but worth watching.  It is not for younger children due to the graphic violence and a brief love scene.

4047867,4,B0030ZIZTK,"Having watched numerous Holocaust-themed dramas, I was surprised to find this new title pop up on a movie rental website I subscribe to. Though many movies have been made on the subject, I find myself learning something new from each movie. ""Spring 1941"" or ""Aviv 41"" is directed by Israeli film director, Uri Barbash, based on stories written by Polish Jewish author Ida Fink who had survived the Holocaust using Aryan papers. Though one can tell the movie is not a big budget production, I was impressed by the credible performances by the lead actors.

The story is set in Poland in 1941 as the Nazis take over Poland and almost immediately begin suppressing the Jewish population. Caught in this dangerous web is a young Jewish doctor, Artur Planck (Joseph Fiennes), his cellist wife, Clara (Clare Higgins), and their two young daughters. Fearing the worst, Artur begs the local produce supplier, Emilia (Maria Pakulnis) to shelter them at her remote rural farmhouse. Emilia refuses, for she knows death awaits any Polish Gentile caught sheltering Jews. But one desperate night, Artur makes the decision to make the dangerous journey (with his family) to Emilia's farmhouse in the country. Tragedy strikes along the way, but the now diminished family make it to the country and Emilia has no choice but to take them in. Here's where things begin to take a strange twist - Emilia, feeling lonely (her husband who was off fighting the Germans, is presumed dead) begins to develop a strong attraction to Artur, and Artur responds to her overtures. Clara, who senses what's going on becomes predictably resentful but also realizes they are at Emilia's mercy.

The movie is told in two narrative strands - one focuses on an older Clara who is visiting Poland to perform in a concert (30 years after the events of the Holocaust), the other is told via Clara's flashbacks to the past involving her younger self, Artur, and Emilia. The switch between the past and present is done quite well, without any jarring effects. The lead actors are credible in their portrayal of individuals driven to make difficult choices under extraordinary and difficult circumstances. Joseph Fiennes is credible as the conflicted husband who feels guilty on the one hand for betraying his wife, but also feels a sense of gratitude and duty towards Emilia. Maria Pakulnis is compelling in her portrayal of a Gentile woman who feels so utterly alone that she contemplates the unthinkable, i.e. having an affair with a married man and hoping to beget children with a Jew, all the more startling given her devoutness. Clare Higgins delivers a finely-nuanced performance as the tortured wife.

There are some disturbing scenes in the movie, involving violent acts towards children and a mass shooting. The movie effectively captures the desperate nature of the  time - the depravity of the Nazis (laughing soldiers clicking away with their cameras as they watch the doomed Jews being marched off to be executed), how people are driven to do the unthinkable under harsh circumstances, etc. It was heartening to see some Poles being portrayed in a positive light - there's a scene where Emilia does all she can to prevent German soldiers from discovering Artur's family in the attic, and another where a Polish Gentile refrains from denouncing Artur to the Germans. There's always the good and bad in people and I felt the movie struck a good balance here in the portrayal of the Poles. ""Spring 1941"" is a well-told human drama which will appeal to those keen on Holocaust dramas.",1274659200,44,3550,4.951342281879195
4047877,2,B0030ZIZTK,"Uninspiring, boring, and predictable. A mind-numbing exercise in depicting familial love amongst the horror of WW2. Bland, stereotypical. Has some nice scenery, above average cinematography, and Fiennes is always good in his role. But all in all, a waste of time unless you like slow, painful stories of 'love through suffering'.",1506643200,,329,5.470588235294118
4047878,2,B0030ZIZTK,"The material, the story line is powerful. A credible story of the Shoah cannot not evoke a strong emotional response in the audience.

4047879,5,B0030ZIZTK,"Hard to believe that this was such recent past and yet the same socialists have managed to come back, take over Europe, and our children here are taught that Nazis were fascists, right wing extremists. The socialist have always invented the most outrageous lies that nobody should believe, and here 60 years later most Americans do not know what Nazi stands for. National Socialist Party, the German Worker's party. Hitler's socialism was a direct copy of the Democratic Party's socialism in the 1920s when their thugs in the KKK numbered 12 million. They copied the Democratic Jim Crow laws, just substituted Jew for Negro and began their thousand year reign of terror that lasted about 12 years. But they never lost, the Socialists in Russia won that war, they doubled the size of the USSR and yet our kids are only taught that if the parents know and teach them at home. And we have so many anti-humanists here now, openly Marxists and the media is mostly Marxist when these kinds of tragedies all fall on their laps. They did this, they did this to all of us, and now they are doing it again, taking power, telling lies, using movies and media to hide their corruption, lies and sociopathic need to kill, either in wars abroad or wishing they could do it here at home. It seems Antifa is an exact copy of the brown shirted Hitler youth, the thugs from Krystalnacht. The media gives them a pass on all their violence, just like in 1930s Germany. So how do we stop them this time? This movie is part of the answer, if only people would see this and then do a little research, like the real history, not the propaganda taught in schools. The Germans were bad, really bad, but not nearly as bad as the Russians under Stalin. He killed 40 million of his own people, but then anti-humanists, like all socialists have been doing that since it all began with Malthus back in the 1750s. Do some research, put this in perspective, understand who the Socialists are and where they came from, and then understand what is in our future if we let this happen again. I was six years old when my parents took me to Buchenwald in the 1950s. I could smell the burned human flesh in those furnaces, they had left the ash and bones in there, as if humans are just garbage. Understand that deep in your heart, if you owe allegiance to only the state, if you have no personal sovereignty, then you will either commit the same atrocities, or be a victim to them. They will not stop, they will have total control over everything, even the air you breathe.",1505606400,3,2535,4.51304347826087

It was so sad and tragic that words cannot describe the empathy felt for those who suffered so at the hands of hateful people and God bless those who risked their lives to save others.  Unfortunately, mankind never learns from past mistakes and human beings today all over the globe are plotting ways to kill one another.  The cellist lived to tell her story.

4047897,4,B0030ZIZTK,"With detail that elicits a whole lot of vicarious terror in the viewer, the story begins with a race by a physician, his renowned cellist wife, and their 2 precious young daughters, to escape Warsaw before its imminent siege by the Nazis.  But it's already underway, and you'll see the horrific result of that. Life in hiding produces all kinds of threats, twists and turns, and something of an existential love triangle. The acting, filming, and directing are excellent. The well-written story is painful to agonizing, albeit authentic. One positive element that one could extract from this story is a not unfamiliar suggestion-- that we be exuberant in our gratitude for all that we have. Just imagine if suddenly all that you cherished, trusted, and knew were ripped from you. A tough-to-view but important film.",1500681600,2,815,5.037037037037037
4047898,3,B0030ZIZTK,"This is a very flawed movie that failed to live up to it's potential. The story of a Polish Jewish couple and their daughter who are hidden by a Polish farm woman in 1941 evolves into a complicated love triangle which is the least interesting part of the story. I found the fake Polish accents to be inauthentic and a distraction. These characters would have been speaking Polish, not English with a Polish accent so why not just let them speak with their English accents? The film lacked focus and none of the characters was fully developed. I was bothered by the illogical continuity. The story begins in 1941 and ends in 1971 and yet the main character has an adult daughter whose age couldn't match this timeline. The film brought up some interesting points about the Poles and their relationship to the Jewish population but never really explores this theme in a satisfactory way.",1500595200,,885,4.716129032258064

4047905,4,B0030ZIZTK,"I admit it:  the English actor Joseph Fiennes was the main reason I became curious enough about SPRING 1941 to order a copy.  Having loved Mr. Fiennes in the movies RISEN and LUTHER I was eager to see more of him, and indeed he does not disappoint in SPRING 1941.  One of the most affecting actors around today, he gives an emotionally devastating performance as Jewish doctor Artur Plank, who in the spring of 1941 flees the Warsaw ghetto with his family, only to become romantically involved with the woman who hides them from the Nazis.  With his tanned complexion Fiennes is not unconvincing physically as a Jewish man; the Polish accent he uses for the role sounds authentic and never falters.

Inevitably, viewers who have seen Roman Polanski's Oscar-winning Holocaust movie THE PIANIST will want to compare SPRING 1941 to it.  There are undeniable similarities:  both movies are about musicians (Szpilman in THE PIANIST, Artur's wife, Clara, in SPRING 1941); both movies are set in Poland.  THE PIANIST, however, was a film with a large cast and a big budget, whose titular character was a real person; SPRING 1941, based on short stories, has a small cast and budget -- yet it uses its limited resources extremely well and never actually looks ""made on the cheap.""  It is a classy, beautifully acted film with things to say about the Holocaust that are different than what THE PIANIST said or what SCHINDLER'S LIST said.  Several scenes in SPRING 1941 are truly horrifying, and the movie as a whole will haunt you for days and weeks.  My only complaint is that I believe more or better incidental music could have enhanced the drama.",1474934400,16,1641,4.783687943262412

This is a great movie and I watch it on Netflix several times.  Each time this movie provokes anger, namely at Emilia.  She took total advantage of this family by coming between the husband and wife relationship.  I thought a lot about Emilia's sacrifice for them and come to the conclusion that I would hope any decent human being would do.  The part that tore right into my heart was the line by Emilia when she demanded the husband to see his family only once a week before church and he must forget he is Jewish and go to church and she said ""I AM NOT ASKING FOR MUCH!!!""  I laugh everytime I hear Emilia stated this and knowing she took advantage of a family's weak and vulnerable position.

Seeing Emilia decades later when she opened to door to see Clara, Emilia's sight frightene me.  She looked like a cavewomen and I thought about the poor family's being victimized by the Nazi and the cavewoman.  Nope I have zero sympathy for Emilia and I would hope any decide human being would help the Jewish people's desparate position.",1403827200,12,1129,4.441747572815534
