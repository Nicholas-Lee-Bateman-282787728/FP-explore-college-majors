8581884,3,B00CHT042Q,"Kelly is one of my favorite fly fishing personalities. His tying skills are second to no one. This video reaffirms that with some outrageous patterns that will catch a lot of fishermen if not some very large fish.  There are good tying tips here. However, this appears to be a showcase for every new material coming on the market, which is nice if you are an innovative tier with an unlimited budget to buy all this stuff.  If you can find it. The patterns are for an experienced tier and many beginners will struggle trying to follow the techniques. It is entertaining and if you are a streamer fisherman, you will enjoy this video.",1372032000,2,633,4.543859649122807
