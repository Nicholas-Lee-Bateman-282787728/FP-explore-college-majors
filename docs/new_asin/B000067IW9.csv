7963200,3,B000067IW9,"In the Weiss Kreuz series, this is not the best disc. It's not the worst, either -- that's the first disc. But the fourth in the series, carrying episodes 16 - 20, is probably the worst-looking of the bunch. Through this stretch the animation quality suffers greatly. The characters are sloppily drawn and the action can be painful to look at. There are moments when the main characters don't even look like themselves!
However, if you can squint past the horrible production values, there are a lot of plot and character developments to enjoy on this disc. After a long separation, the Weiss team is forced to work together again, though Aya goes unwillingly. It takes the persuasion of a Kritiker operative, Botan, to try and convince Aya  that the only way he can help his sister is by working *with* Weiss and not in spite of them. We also see a large part of Aya's character develop in relation (or non-relation) to Sakura, as he delivers his most profound line in the entire series.
After you've suffered through the bad animation, you'll definitely feel deserving of the extras. There are more Japanese voice actor interviews! Watch the rock-scissors-paper tournament and laugh. You've earned it!",1032134400,4,1203,4.868292682926829
