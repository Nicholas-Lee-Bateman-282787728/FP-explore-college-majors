8237925,1,B0010HOZKI,"This anime is a mess. Boys Be... is a romantic/comedy anime that follows 3 boys as they enter the world of dating. There are a variety of girls that the boys interact with, some resulting in romance, some in heartbreak. That so far is fine, but the issue is that there are far too many side characters that the main trio are overshadowed and left underdeveloped. For the first few episodes it's like a new girl every episode that simply disappears in the next with no mention of said character. The animation itself is poor at best and frequently the characters are off model. The ending too is not an ending, rather the series just stops. There are no resolutions or any real feeling of growth for the characters (Two in particular are especially infuriating). The show would have benefited with more episodes and less side characters. I don't particularly think this is an anime that absolutely deserves a purchase, but if you want a series that builds then abruptly stops, then you may like this anime.",1513814400,,1005,4.68361581920904
8237926,5,B0010HOZKI,The artwork and voice actor did a very good job. The story was good as well. The only part of the story I was bite sad about. When the track/field girl kiss another guy. Her boyfriend saw it.,1486684800,,191,4.052631578947368

8237930,5,B0010HOZKI,"The story line is really good, when I first say the anime i was a little hesitant because i wasn't sure if I'd like it. But I was so wrong. But like I said its a really good storyline and the pace of the show is nice and consistent. The characters seem very relatable and not kiddy. The only weird thing is the part where you can tell when a commercial break comes in it shows random parts of women, not offensive (well not to me) but just seems annoying and stupid, but overall a good show",1383004800,,490,4.061855670103093

8237932,4,B0010HOZKI,"I admit when I first started watching I didn't think much of it and it seemed a bit ""hokey"" - but that passed quickly.  Seeing a title like this one from a different perspective (from the boys point of view) was something new, and unique.  All the qualities still exist stemming from almost any similar title in the genre (like To Heart for example) and none of the qualities that make this type of series fun to watch are missing just because it's not girls and their woes.  Definitely a nice spin and new angle - I'd recommend it to ANY anime watcher who prefers a broad scope of what they watch versus the often overused and similar story formulas that keep hoping to strike gold.",1360108800,,683,4.404761904761905

8237934,3,B0010HOZKI,"I have to say I was more then a little worried when I first picked up Boys Be the anime. I'm a huge fan of the manga series it's based off of and well my experience had taught me that anime made from manga just don't measure up. Sadly that wisdom has proven true with this series. Even now after a month after I've watched it my furry at how they botched the anime series still burns.

The series starts off following six friends. Three guys of high school age and three girls of high school age.  The series then proceeds to follow these six friends along their romantic ventures of their youths. This is all well and good until the car stalls. What do I mean well . . . Let me first list off the good things about the series.

One has to be said that the animation is pretty good. It's not great, or ground shattering but it is above average for an anime of its age. The music to be honest is forgettable. The voice acting is actually pretty good. Also the story, for the most part if I try real hard to forget the manga is okay with some of the adventures of our characters bordering on toughing. The voice acting is, well the best part of the series, the English voice actors did a rather good job from what I can remember.

Note my last comment. Yeah . . . from what I can remember. That's one of the main problems with this series. Yes in case you're wondering I'm going to list off the series flaws now. First and for most what was utterly unforgivable to me was how the story was set up. I didn't have a problem with it focusing on the friends however after they were set up with their respective matches I expected the series to move on to their friends. However the series stubbornly sticks to the friends and messes up one of the relationships of what seemed like a perfect couple merely to keep the series going. In order to explain this I think I need to explain how the original mangas are set up. In the originals each story are completely disconnected from each other, each chapter has different characters. This is not to say that the plot had to depend on said mistake. In fact a number of the chapters from the mangas take place after the couple in the story have gotten together and would have made great substance for the anime series. However instead the anime makes clunky attempts to fit in what I call `couple becoming couple' chapters together thus really destroying the continuity of the series. This especially makes me cringe as a number of the chapter the anime tried to adapt are among my favorite and the fact they in relation to the originals were batched did not help my opinion of the series any.

To explain my point I'm going to include a spoiler so skip this if you want to buy this hell or high water and want to know nothing.

Spoilers start

The series starts out with one of the guys starting to awaken to romantic interests in girls which focuses sole on his childhood friend. As it turn out this childhood friend (a member of the three girl main characters if you're wondering) likes him as well. After spending two episodes on them things move on to the other four characters until about half way threw the series. Then the original couple that seemed break up for some really dump and ill thought out reasons. The rest of the series with little exception follows  the original male lead on his other romantic adventures all the while he keeps thinking and otherwise pining for his original girl friend. This as you can imagine rather kills every story past this point. Finally he makes up his mind that the one for him is the original girl however as far as I know never tells her or tries to make up with her before the series ends.

Spoilers end.

In the end I can't say this is a terrible series. However I cannot say that its really worth the money to buy it. So I have to recommend not getting this series, rent it if you want but don't buy it. Save your money for better series.",1229558400,7,3930,4.313008130081301
