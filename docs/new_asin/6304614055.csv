7876259,4,6304614055,"Another great entry in ST:TNG's Borg saga, ""I, Borg"" features our Starfleet stalwarts facing the standard weekly moral dilemma(s) and their own prejudices & preconceptions following the rescue of a single Borg, eventually given the name Hugh, from a crash site. Captain Picard is especially torn between his respect for life in all its forms versus using the Borg captive as a weapon against its own kind (being thrown into the collective and forced against your will to kill and destroy will do that to you). His role playing of his Borg persona Locutus from the ""Best of Both Worlds"" cliffhanger at the climax makes for one of the episode's more disquieting moments. Through it all, Hugh develops from a part dependent on the whole into a fully realized individual, with repercussions that would be followed up in the subsequent Borg saga two-parter ""Descent"". If you're a big time Borgophile like myself, this one's unquestionably a must-have!

Sadly, I used to enjoy this eppie a LOT more (as well as all the others) before a Trek-viewer friend pointed out that Captain Picard has a bit of a lazy eye! It's not as obvious as Worf's (Michael Dorn) slight lack of proper ocular alignment, but it is perceptible if you look hard enough. The hell of it is, I never noticed it before! But that's not the worst of it... every time I do see Patrick Stewart on the tube now, be he Picard, Gurney Halleck, Leodegranz, or that guy in ""Conspiracy Theory"", I see it each and every time, to the point of being somewhat distracting.

Yes, I know, you're probably thinking, ""what kinda sick weirdo focuses on- and is distracted by- some TV star's physical shortcomings? Get over it!"" Hey, I can't explain it... it's just one of those weird things. Shatner had his hairline (before his priceline, heh), Doohan had his missing finger, Nimoy had his substabdard singing ability... and Stewart has his eyeballs staring in slightly different directions. It's just kinda freaky, you know?

Needless to say, I have one less buddy I watch TV with nowadays...
