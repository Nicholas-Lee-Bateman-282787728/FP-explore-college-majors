8312800,4,B001ELMXWM,"I have some of Nancy Evan's other pitching videos - this one is good.  But it's not for beginners.  Most of the drills are advanced - showing how to enhance various pitches - screwball, curveball, dropball, riseball, etc.  It does a good job on those, but my daughter is now at the fastball/changeup stage, so most of the drills aren't applicable yet.  I'll keep the video for when she gets further along.",1285372800,2,405,4.583333333333333
