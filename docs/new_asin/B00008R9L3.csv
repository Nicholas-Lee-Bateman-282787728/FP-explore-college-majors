It is a message to all of us that you have to be careful and, not just a little wise, when it comes to loving relationships.  The heart and mind can do strange things when love rears its head!  Ah!  Such is life all over!  NJMJr!!!",1511049600,,318,4.064516129032258

7986335,3,B00008R9L3,"Amor de Hombre is a solid 3.5 star movie and entirely watchable entertainment. BTW, that's 3.5 stars on the ""Real Movie"" scale, not that grading-on-a-curve excess generosity too often bestowed on films with GLBT content. Yes, I understand there was a time not long ago when gay story lines were so rare, many folks felt they deserved to be treated like the Special Olympics of Cinema where making it to the finish line was cause for celebration. Don't get me wrong. I am a big supporter of of the Special Olympics and the often hugely challenged young people who participate. When it comes to movies, however, I am a hardcore Darwinist. It's damn hard work making a movie, and it is offensive as hell to imagine filmmakers are less able as a consequence of either their subject matter or their affectional preference.

The directors here have been entirely competent, even if they owe a tad more than their female star to the films of Pedro Almodovar. They fall considerably short of Almodovar's unique meld of edgy verve (or do I mean nerve?) and surprising depth, but then again, nobody else working the corner of Rom-Com and Queer comes to mind as his equal, either.  Someone else writing here calls it ""Almodovar Lite.""  Always happy to see my POV validated.

There is a short epithet, two words, three letters each, for the sort of woman who builds her life around her male homosexual friends. Some find the term unflattering, and we disagree, but have no desire to offend anyone. Nonetheless, Loles Len (the Almodovar veteran) plays a classic example of the type. She catches pitch-perfect the pathos of knowing that the man you love is never going to love back you in the same way that you love him, and as many women in San Francisco where I live appear to have decided, the movie appears to concur that the love of a good friend is definitely preferable to no love at all. Meanwhile, there are plenty of nice looking, if not exactly intellectually formidable, guys about in this picture, and people mostly seem to be enjoying their lives. You might consider watching this movie and doing the same.  Because as I see that to be the moral of this tale, and I think one is definitely intended, you might do so much worse.",1329177600,,2227,4.656488549618321

7986337,5,B00008R9L3,"Well, yes is a bit like the spaniar version of Will & Grace, but the story is interesting. Good looking guys, and a unique way of storytelling. I'm sure you'll enjoy if you are into light drama, romantic comedy.",1150675200,,211,4.435897435897436
7986338,3,B00008R9L3,"""Amor de Hombre"" is a movie that has a great script, good direction, good acting, plenty of ""eye candy"" and about everything that I usually enjoy in a movie especially one that is based on a ""gay theme"".  So why have I only given it three (3) stars? I'm afraid that the two main characters annoyed me immensely.

Ramon is a gay man that fits so nauseatingly well the stereotypical view of a very shallow young gay man.  He is very handsome and  is always looking for ""Mister Right""; however, no man is good enough or manly enough for him.  In the film, when he does supposedly fall in love it's with an, at first, unavailable thug. In the film his only true love is, of course,  Esperanza who is a 40 something year old extreme ""fag hag"".

The character of Esperanza really annoyed the hell out of me.  She is a one of the most possessive, irritatating and manipulative types of person that I have ever seen in a movie. The type that I feel needs to get a life of her own.  She just can't find a straight man to her liking or more importantly one that is similar to her gay friend Ramon who she also does not want to have anyone else but her.  Therefore, she does everything in her power to sabotage any relationship Ramon just might have and is always there to comfort and hold his hand when life ain't working out, for him, too well.  The weakling character of Ramon is, of course, very easily manipulated by Esperanza.  The movie ends where we started with Esperanza and Ramon platonically kissing, at sunset, on a beautiful beach.  She's happy and I'm sure that he's happy-after all tomorrow they'll still be looking for Mister Right; however, they'll ALWAYS have each other.  In other words this movie is a feature length Spanish version of the television sitcom ""Will and Grace"".",1147651200,4,1785,4.469135802469136
7986339,4,B00008R9L3,"Really good Spanish movie that reflects the deep and sincere friendship that can be developed among 2 different type of individuals, excellent performances, and good script, out of the ordinary, I'll recommended strongly to anyone with an open criteria.",1140652800,2,253,5.512820512820513
7986340,4,B00008R9L3,"AMOR DE HOMBRE  is a smaart, snappy, fast-paced, entertaining little film which considering its release date of 1997 was a precursor to the now frequent appearance of films that deal with tender relationships between gay men and straight women ('My Best Friend's Wedding' and all the spin-offs).  It is a smart script, well cast and acted and directed and scored and should be given the chance for a theater release now, in more expansive gender-friendly times.

Ram&oacute;n (Andrea Occhipinti) is a handsome, successful lawyer in Madrid who happens to be gay and unlike most of his friends has not settled into a partnership.  His closest friend is Esperanza (Loles Le&oacute;n) who is a divorced school teacher, just turned 40, who love Ram&oacute;n and constantly tries to help him find the 'right man' while Ram&oacute;n tries to help her find her 'right man'.  They party together with all of Ram&oacute;n's professional friends - doctors, businessmen, teachers - and Ram&oacute;n is hedonistic enough to have a different be partner every evening.  After an automobile accident in which Ram&oacute;n is injured, Esperanza moves in to care for him, a care that includes asking one of her fellow Phys Ed teachers Roberto (Armando del R&iacute;o) to offer physical therapy and massage to the ailing Ram&oacute;n.  Because Roberto seems to rebuff Ram&oacute;n's growing obsession with an unattainable straight man, the therapy ends when Ram&oacute;n is able to walk.  A twist occurs once Ram&oacute;n is well and Roberto changes roles and is seductive to Ram&oacute;n, a romance that comes to a tragic ending.  In the end it is the quality of friendship between Ram&oacute;n and Esperanza that provides the lasting nucleus of this tale.

It is refreshing to see a film that focuses on healthy men who happen to be gay instead of a series of beleaguered victims of the usual stereotypes who end up with hopeless tragic lives.  Yes, the circle of friends seems always on the watch for the 'new man on the block', but the cruising is healthy and fun.  The movie works so well because of the fine writing and direction by an amazing team - Yolanda Garc&iacute;a Serrano

Juan Luis Iborra - who seem to have pared down life in Madrid's professional sector with a fresh eye on variety!  The cast is superb with special kudos to  Loles Le&oacute;n and Andrea Occhipinti.  This is a light and very entertaining comedy with a message. Recommended.  In Spanish with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, September 05",1126396800,4,2502,5.031553398058253
7986341,3,B00008R9L3,"This perfectly enjoyable but somewhat forgettable movie is Almodovar Lite. If you like that previously-quirky-and-now-more-serious Spanish director, then you'll find ""Amor de Hombre"" a good way to pass the time.

The story is very simple: A rather immature, attractive gay man claims he wants a relationship, but all his actions indicate otherwise. This causes exasperation in his female bosom buddy, who can't seem to find a straight man of her own. That's about it. It's well made, though, and has some funny moments.

I'd recommend these other films of a similar type more highly: Italy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/His-Secret-Life/dp/B0013HQHQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">His Secret Life</a>&nbsp;(extremely good - read my review for that one), Brazil's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Possible-Loves/dp/B00009ZY9T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Possible Loves</a>&nbsp;(a ""Sliding Doors"" concept, with excellent performances) and Spain's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Km-0/dp/B00014NEUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Km. 0</a>&nbsp;(not perfect, but charming).",1078963200,8,1194,8.3203125
