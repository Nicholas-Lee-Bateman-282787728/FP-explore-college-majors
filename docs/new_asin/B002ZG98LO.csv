4029562,2,B002ZG98LO,"""Predators"" begins with Adrien Brody coming to in mid-freefall, which is a first for me as a moviegoer. We don't exactly know where he fell from, but we do know that he's literally falling from the sky, and only at the last second does he realize he's equipped with a parachute, which miraculously pops open. Regardless, his landing is rough; he plummets through dense jungle foliage before ending up in a muddy clearing. Over the next few minutes, he meets - and is nearly killed by - seven other people, all having mysteriously fallen from the sky. No one knows where they are, nor do they know how or why they came to be there. They last thing they remember is seeing a flash of light.

Brody's character is a soldier-turned-mercenary named Royce. Isabelle (Alice Braga) is an Israeli Defense Force sniper. Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) is a Mexican drug cartel enforcer. Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) is a former RUF death squad officer from Sierra Leone. Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov) is a Russian VDV commando. Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) is a Japanese Yakuza assassin. Stans (Walton Goggins) is a death-row inmate from San Quentin Prison. All of them have arrived in his jungle heavily armed; the only exception is Stans, who only has a knife. That's when Royce begins flaunting his uncanny ability to make completely accurate connections with little to no information: They were all chosen to be here because they have all killed people. The only one he can't make sense of is Edwin (Topher Grace), a doctor who has had no defense training and lacks weapons of a military nature.

A view from higher ground reveals that they are no longer on Earth. The sky looks like an illustration from a science fiction magazine, with bizarre pink clouds swirling around gigantic moons and what looked to me like Jupiter. How convenient that they should land on a planet so like our own - covered with water, encased in a breathable atmosphere, in command of the same levels of gravity despite the orbiting moon that looks about twice the size of ... but never mind. As they explore the region, Edwin comes across a diabolical looking barbed plant and uses his scalpel to extract some goop from its petals, which he claims is a neurotoxin. This isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that he names the plant by its genus and species; this means that (a) he somehow knows intimate details about the plant life of an alien planet, and that (b), no matter where you are in the universe, nomenclature is based in Latin.

Back to the plot. In the jungle, our ruthless killers find a series of crashed crates, which contain unknown organic matter. They then stumble onto a series of booby traps, all set by a former hostage whose body now lies rotting against a tree stump. Once again, amazingly, Royce figures it out: They're all being hunted in a game preserve. It's right around then that all the big, nasty creatures start coming out of the woodwork, including spiny dog-like quadrupeds and, of course, the classic Predator warriors, with their dreadlocked heads and toothy fish-like mouths. A lot of shooting occurs between now and the end of the movie, which begs the question of where they're getting fresh supplies of ammo, since they had only so much of it when they were dropped onto the planet in the first place ... but never mind.

I'm well aware that science fiction/action/horror/adventure films aren't all that invested in plausibility, and I'm perfectly fine with that. That isn't the issue, anyway. ""Predators"" is a morass of plot holes and inconsistencies, a film that doesn't follow the very rules it took the time to set. How can we possibly get into the stunts, the violence, and the gore if we're mentally pausing every five minutes to question what we've just seen and why it happened? Perhaps I'm too picky, but I'm sorry, even pure escapist films should be bound by some kind of logic.

It doesn't help that many of the characters are unlikeable. Stans in particular is a man so vile that I actually found myself hoping he would be dead before the end of the movie. I leave it to you to find out whether or not this comes to pass. As for Royce, there's no accounting for his ability to figure out exactly what's going on and why, so in the end, he comes off as nothing more than an arrogant tough guy with no sense of compassion. Some of my issues with him have to do with the casting of Adrien Brody, which felt all wrong. Never once did I believe him as a mercenary, an ex-soldier, or even a generic survivalist, and I don't care how often he swears or much mud he smears across his face and chest. What about someone like Jason Statham or Gerard Butler? Clich choices, no question, but at least we know they work well in action films. Unfortunately, I don't think even they could have saved ""Predators"" from falling through one of its own plot holes.",1278633600,8,4864,4.664335664335664
4029563,5,B002ZG98LO,"Predators
is the best summer movie so far and one of the best of the year. I'll be honest I've only seen three summer movies. There was Iron Man 2, The A Team and now Predators. It's just been a really Summer for movies. You can just tell by the previews that they aren't going to be remotely good. Now out of the three Predators is the best movie.

Predators harkens back to the first Predators movie. Breaking from the recent horrible Alien Vs Predator movies. The movie has the same feel as the first movie. It also has the same kind of set up a group off harden killers try to survive against a group of Predators. I had some lingering doubts that this movie would be good but I was wrong, it was great. It had a great premise. Instead of hunting on Earth the Predators take humans to another planet. A planet wide game preserve where the Predators hone their skills.

The characters introductions won't surprise to many people. The loner but reluctant leader. The man with a family. The silent warrior. It goes on from there. There is one character you won't be able to read, because he just doesn't belong with the group which was a nice twist. The actors from Adrien Brody and Topher Grace
to Alice Braga and Danny Trejo all did really good jobs with their characters. The only person I had a problem with and the only real problem I had with the movie was Noland (Laurence Fishburne). What was the point of his character except to movie the plot along and they really didn't need him for that. And I like the actor too. He almost always plays interesting characters. It's just in this movie he was pointless.

The action and special effects were truly well done. There were many great scenes. But my favorite had to be the scene between Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and one of the predators. I won't give anything away but it was one of the best if not the best scenes of the movie.

The ending of the movie was open ended which I really liked. There's so many directions they can take this franchise as long as they don't go back to the Alien Vs Predator type of movie I think I'll be happy. Overall this is a excellent movie. Out of the three Predator movies (I just chose to believe the AVP movies never existed) I would have to say this is the second best movie. It was ha hard choice between the first one and this one but I just love the Arnold and the cast of the first movie more. In fact all the Predator movies were great it's just that the first one was the best.

4029564,4,B002ZG98LO,"Predators has been one of my most anticipated films of the year ever since the trailer debuted. The trailer gave off the impression that the film had the same atmosphere as the original, but modernized with a new cast and contained more than one Predator. While the Alien Vs Predator films were either terrible or left a lot to be desired, could a new Predator film get everything back on track? I'm delighted to say yes. That's exactly the case.

The cast seems bizarre on paper; there's that guy who had sex with a creature that contained spliced human and animal DNA (Adrien Brody), Eric Forman from That 70's Show (Topher Grace), that girl who was mostly artificial organs in Repo Men (Alice Braga), that guy who always manages to play a bad ass Mexican and appears in most Robert Rodriguez films (Danny Trejo), Morpheus from The Matrix (Laurence Fishburne), and Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) among many others. The dynamic cast is actually one of the most absorbing factors of the film. Topher Grace adds that little bit of humor in most of the screen time he has and his character ventures off into territory you may not be expecting. ""Justified""'s Walton Goggins steals quite a few humorous lines, as well. Royce (Brody) and Isabelle (Braga) would probably be pretty dull if it wasn't for the chemistry the two develop the longer they're around each other. Laurence Fishburne's introduction scene alone is arguably more bad ass than anything he did in The Matrix. The cast really makes this film work; plain and simple.

Returning to the jungle was another great move. It brings back the nostalgic factor of the first film that everyone seems to love. The fact that they referenced the events in the original was a nice touch, as well. After giving the impression that it was a reboot, Predators is apparently meant to be a sequel to the first two Predator films. It's still good to know that at least all of this is taking place in the same universe. The other thing that really makes this film fantastic other than the cast are the Predators themselves. They all look rather brilliant. While there are ""smaller"" Predators that look incredibly similar to the original design, there are others that are larger, stronger, and have slightly different weaponry or tracking devices. The film doesn't shy away from blood and gore either, which I highly approve of. When a film like this uses the R-rating to its advantage, it just gives me goosebumps.

The one thing that can really be nitpicked is the ending since the film just kind of stops and leaves way too much room for a sequel. Oddly enough though, it's still strangely satisfying but that could be due to the rest of the film being so superb.

Predators delivers one of the most solid and satisfying sequels to date. The visual and make-up effects are top notch, the strong cast seems to play off one another and is entertaining to watch, and the film manages to pay just enough homage to the original film while venturing off into its own territory. Predators should please any fan of the franchise or anyone who enjoys action, sci-fi, thriller, or even horror films. If you've been anticipating this film as much as I have and it didn't disappoint me, then you have nothing to lose.",1278633600,,3245,4.7178130511463845
4029565,5,B002ZG98LO,One of the best movies of summer 2010. Like an old-school 80s sci-fi horror film!!,1278633600,,82,4.533333333333333
4029566,4,B002ZG98LO,"It has taken a string of awful sequels for someone such as Nimrod Antal to step up and take the Predator franchise back to its roots of gore, suspense and plain fear, but does it do these things well? ""Predators"" sets it story deep within the nostalgia of fans with a jungle setting similar to the original. We are introduced to an unconscious Royce, a hardened, ex-military mercenary played by Adrien Brody, free-falling from the sky over the jungle. After a warm welcome from fellow drop ins, the newly formed team of eight begin to make sense of their surroundings.

""Predators"" builds the tension between the characters similarly to that of the original with fear and uncertainty clouding their minds. The eerie-ness and unfamiliarity of the environment and it's contents are also set just as in the first film. The building of this tension plays out smoothly and doesn't rush itself to get to it's point (the whole alien planet/we are being hunted/""If it bleeds, it can be killed"" deal) Not until the end of the film does it feel rushed and out of balance with the beginning and midpoint. The chemistry between the characters doesn't bore at all, even with their backgrounds as ""the most dangerous killers on Earth"" the flow of dialect and development with each character is enough to hold the viewer's interest and move the story along realistic grounds. A very interesting note is how the characters explain their backgrounds and solidify their characters through the traps set within the film (theirs and others.) There are also many specific pieces paying homage to the original, such as the explanation of the Hunters and a few of the battle sequences.

Speaking very shortly about the gore, it plays its part in solidifying the harsh settings the characters are placed in and the brutality of the creatures they are faced against, (Most notably the campsite of the Predators and what every fan wanted to see, the taking of the ""trophies."") unlike the past two sequels (*shudders*) where the first was devoid of nearly any gore and the second making it seem laughable and rendering it useless.

I have only two gripes about the film, one being the pacing near the end, (as mentioned earlier) after meeting with another survivor named Nolan (Laurence Fishburne) and the events leading to another encounter with the Predator creatures, the remaining survivors start to die off quite fast. Even though the plan made before the set chase is clear, I felt that the suspense kind of died after that leaving only one minor twist afterwards. Oh and Topher Grace (I think you will see him mentioned in many reviews to come for the movie) Didn't leave a strong enough impression. Without giving too much away about him, I believe that his character's motives could have been fleshed out a little better than the film made them.

Bottom line, ""Predators"" plants its feet in the ground and exclaims with confidence that ""this is more than a sequel, it's a return to form."" and a return very well needed. Even with it's numerous similarities, ""Predators"" is able to stand on it's own with a strong cast and a smooth mix of violence, gore, charisma and chemistry and screams possibilities of sequels to come.",1278633600,76,3204,4.841240875912408
4029567,4,B002ZG98LO,"""Predators"" is back to basics return for the ""Predator"" franchise, they have juggled the elements that made the first film successful but couldn't seem to get right for the sequel or the ""Alien vs. Predator"" movies. ""Predators"" starts with the original premise of the first movie. Eight people of different ethnicities (if not occupations) are thrown into a living green hell of a jungle except they all don't know how they got there or where they are. The only thing they're sure of is that they were involved in some war, they saw a light and the next thing they remember is waking up as they fell into the jungle.

As the eight get to know each and their surroundings, ""Predators"" relies on the camaraderie of the individuals and the stress of the situation for each character to reveal themselves to each other and the audience, and they discover every one may not be what they seem. There's also a nice bit of gallows humor to lighten the moments and was one of the things that gave the original ""Predator"" some of it's charm.

The predators have some new toys including the spiky dogs, and we learn there are two different kinds of predators, the standard one we're used to seeing is the smaller of the species and are hunted by the larger super-predator when no other game is available.

One bit of casting I was worried about was Topher Grace, the geeky Eric Forman of ""That 70's Show,"" he seemed miscast or ill fitted for Eddie Brock in ""Spiderman 3,"" and here he's the one element that doesn't fit, but he isn't supposed to, and he looks right for the part and delivers a role that at first looks like a straightforward but has some twists. Laurence Fishburne does a near-cameo as Noland, a soldier marooned on the planet and who may be from the Vietnam era, I think he hums a bit of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" used to such great effect in Apocalypse Now.

I at first thought ""Predators"" was directed by Robert Rodriquez and that was one of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing the movie. I was a little disappointed that Rodriquez only produces, but this movie does incorporate some of the feel of a movie directed by Rodriquez but that may be because ""Predators"" is based on a screenplay Rodriguez wrote sixteen years ago . Directing is Nimrod Antal and he moves the movie tautly along never veering off course or too far off course, and he does add some visual artistry that hasn't been seen in any of the previous movies but gives us a sense of the alieness of the world the characters find themselves trapped on.

""Predators"" is conscious of the events of the first ""Predator"" movie and the climatic battle is a tweaked version that is an homage to Arnold's battling of the predator while building on some of the inferred weaknesses of the predators. ""Predators"" is a good telling of a ""Predator"" story, using bits of the original and adding its own devices to the ""Predator"" mythology.",1278633600,202,2914,4.585412667946257
4029738,1,B002ZG98LO,"""Predator"" was original, suspenseful and and blessed with vivid characters. This is a a remake with all but three of those assets. If it doesn't hit you right between the eyes in the first ten minutes who will be the only survivors, you probably shouldn't be using metal utensils. This is an homage to banality. That is capped off with the off-the-rack final action scene where the antagonist is about to deliver the fatal blow and a disabled protagonist is struggling to arm, aim and fire a weapon. Gee, do you think she'll manage to do that? They milk this turkey for about 90 seconds. As if this weakly resuscitated copy isn't hobbled enough with lame plot and mediocre characters, the score sounds like it was bought from a cheap, royalty-free website. You are far better served by watching the original again. yes, you will know what is going to happen, but that's no different from viewing this.",1525132800,,901,4.708860759493671
4029739,1,B002ZG98LO,"I have been a long time fan of the first 2 Predator movies with their action, creativity, still great special effects, interesting characters, great casting, and humor.  Unfortunately with this 3rd outing, the delivery on any of those elements is just plain poor.

While this movie does offer some fan service with it's several nods to the first Predator movie, whatwith the soldiers and others fighting the Predators doing so in a jungle, the use of the Predator theme and Little Richard's Long Tall Sally, the soldiers shooting up the jungle as they couldn't see the Predators at first, one character using one of the classic guns from the first movie and so on.  The problem is, that is all that this movie has to offer.

Otherwise, this movie is a huge trainwreck for the following reasons:
-The acting is so wooden and devoid of emotion that you can practically see termites crawling on the actors
-All of the characters are completely one dimensional, nothing but dull stereotypes, and as such, it's impossible to care about these characters at all.
-The character of Royce played by Adrian Brody, is cold, cynical, and unsympathetic.  As such Royce is one unlikable character that one just can't root for.
-The plot is only half clear and is entirely forgettable.
-Danny Trejo dies without getting to do much.
-This movie just plain takes itself too seriously when some humor really would have helped to make this movie more watchable.
-There are no quotable lines.
The action is minimal, devoid of explosions, and bland.
Not only are all of the performances of the actors wooden but also the acting is atrocious as well.
-Finally, this movies tones are just too dark, cold, bitter, and crude to watch.

All in all, this movie completely falls short of both earlier Predator movies in that this movie has no charm, no humor, bland characters, lousy acting, forgettable characters, a minimal and forgettable plot, none of the characters prove to be relatable at all, none of actors appeared to have their hearts in their performances either.  So in other words everything that was done so well in the first 2 movies was missing here to the point of doing just the polar opposite instead.  0 Stars out of 10!!  ONE COMPLETELY WORTHLESS SEQUEL!!!",1524096000,,2250,4.838541666666667

The acting is spot on, the director nailed the creepy vibe and the premise correctly.

Subsequently it got completely underserved low reviews by fanboys, while actual movie critics said the movie was incredibly well done. Also keep in mind that Predators came out in 2008, before the big amazon/netflix/hulu/tv on demand boom that exists now. Also before most social media websites. Twitter wasn't out, neither was instagram, and Facebook had just started. Most people were not even on Facebook in 2008. This movie did not have the benefit of being pushed through social media like many of movies today do. I think had this came out now, it would be far more successful. Predators is a good enough franchise that we should getting a movie AT LEAST every 3 to 4 years.

4030688,4,B002ZG98LO,"Very good cast. Predator as I see it is a masterpiece. You had the first movie where Arnold could really act a bit while speaking English and surrounding him with athletes like Carl Weather's and Jesse Ventura who was also a NAVY SEAL(Thank you for your service) who were also put together physically as well as I believe Bull Duke(The ""Bodies"" best friend), and Shane Black. The script was solid and special effects at time were amazing, and the cinematography was spectacular at the time with the panoramic scenes. Also, I am a collector of movie score CD'S. I don't know anyone else who listens to that music, but there is no such thing as a good movie unless there is a great score, which in last 15 years was dominated by Hanz Zimmer after John Williams then Danny Elfman, and during their times as well. As a music/audiophile, Hanz Zimmer is up there with the all time legendary composers going back to Renaissance. Fare well to James Horner, another great composer as well. I bring this up because the next composer on list is Alan Silverstein and in my opinion up to that point in time, that was the most innovative and iconic soundtrack of ALL TIME. Literally, there is only the first five minutes where in the helicopter they play ""Good Time Tonight"" and then 2 hours of just masterful composition for that film. You know instantly that Predator is on in the other room, just hearing seconds of the score. I bring this up because to have a true sequel with modern special effects and having to find someone to play Arnold with his ridiculous biceps and just star power is a tall order. Adrien Brody is a top tier actor, but I wanted have even considered him to play that roll. He did a nice job for what he was compared too. The cast was also excellent. Some big time actors in that movie. The movie was good. I give it 4 stars because the Lawrence Fishburn scenes just seemed incongruent with the plot and screen play, but they had to write in a way off the planet,.....so, and again cast, Lawrence Fishburn which wasn't his best performance. However Danny Trejo played his role as only Danny can do it. Oleg Taktarov, who is a very underrated actor did a very nice job, and again like in the first movie, he is an elite athlete now retired Russian mixed martial artist. He is a practitioner of Sambo and Judo and has competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Pride Fighting Championships. IMPRESSIVE LIFE BIO. Topher Grace is a top tier actor and I thought was excellent. Of course we come to one of the most under rated actor as far as name recognition(everyone knows his face and he has been in MAJOR MOVIES as a magnificent character actor) speaking of Walton Goggins (Stan's the sociopathic death row criminal who redeems himself at the end) who I think is top ten supporting actor in Hollywood. Anyway, I enjoyed the homage they paid to the original including the original score which appears rather often. A good movie considering the 37 others made prior to it. Nothing like those. Well, that's my take.",1481932800,,3031,4.573529411764706

  Now, I am a HUGE Predator FAN, from the original (Own the Blueray and 3D versions), to Alien vs Predator!!! I know what some maybe thinking...""How are you a HUGE Predator fan and never seen this?""... Well I'll tell ya why...

  I always seen this movie (from the trailers, to seeing it while looking to rent movies in Family Video over the years) as just some knockoff!!! Yes, i read this book by it's cover, and i gotta say... BOY WAS I WRONG!!! This is the movie that SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREDATOR 2!!!

  After watching the movie, my first thought was ""man, that was almost as good as the original"".... But after watching the original again, and then watching this movie, gotta say...IT WAS ALL NOSTALGIA SPEAKING TO ME!!!!

  This is simply a better version of the original, hands down IMO!!! It has more depth, more twist, a better plot, and better characters! I will say though, the original satisfied me more-so as far as the ending compared to this. This version sets up a sequel which will obviously never come, which honestly makes me REALLY sad!!! Another awesome fact about this movie is that it mentions the original ""87"" film, and ties right in along with it!

  This is the version of Predator 2 we should have gotten!!! I respect and love Shane Black, but I honestly feel like he is doing the franchise a disservices by not keeping with the same storyline this movie introduced, and basing the next Predator installment on the original and (the horrible) part 2.

Subsequent renditions in the Preditor franchise were wanting until this movie emerged in 2010. Very reminiscent of the original movie, slow but unpredictable from the beginning with the characters having to sort out their situation/predicament having all woken up in free fall from who knows where and eventually discovering that they are on an alien planet and are prey to a team of sophisticated alien hunters.

4031175,5,B002ZG98LO,"Predators is a really good thriller.  The concept appeals to me a lot- just drop several random people into a mysterious jungle and see what happens!  In this case the people group together to try and figure out where they are, why they're here and how to get out.

What drastically helps is that Predators features nothing but one big name actor/actress after another.  As someone who loves movies, it's interesting to watch all these people communicate with each other.  Adrien Brody is the logical one in charge (well after the group realizes it would be best to stick together and not kill each other that is).  He sort of reminds me of Rambo in a sense, but probably cooler (sorry Sylvestor!)  He's one of the first characters we see drop into the jungle.  Then comes Alice Braga.  I actually really feel sorry for her.  She seems to find herself in life or death situations time and time again.  You want her to stand up and prevail!  She's a sniper.

Laurence Fishburne is introduced later.  You shouldn't trust this guy.  Even if he seems normal at first, he's not!  He leads the others into thinking he's on their side and there to bring them in and offer support... but no.  They all get a surprise soon enough!  Danny Trejo... without spoiling too much, he's the first one to get it.  Kind of ominous the way it happens with his back turned and just sitting on the ground.  Darn I was hoping they'd all survive too!  Topher Grace of That 70's Show fame almost seems out of place... until we find out his character is a researcher.  He offers important knowledge on the mysterious plants around (don't touch that poisonous jellyfish-looking plant either!)

Walton Goggins is a no good criminal.  Very sneaky and someone who begs for a gun.  Don't give him a gun!  Give him a bullet instead.  Hehe just kidding.  Watch your back though.  Louis Ozawa Changchien is the mysterious quiet fellow of the group.  He almost acts like he belongs in a Matrix movie instead.  Enjoyable character because we want to know his reason for being there.  Oleg Taktarov is the Russian.  He's a tough guy and pretty savvy.  He probably shouldn't have introduced himself by firing machine gun blasts at Adrien though!  He doesn't do mixed martial arts in the movie though.  Some of you might be disappointed about that.

Anyway as these characters stick together and walk through the jungle with caution, they come across some unusual events.  First of all Adrian points out that the sun hasn't moved the whole time they were walking.  Hmmmm, I guess that rules out South America!  Then again the story says they're in the Central American jungle?  The sun doesn't move there?  Who knows.  I like when Adrien mentions the sun because suddenly the atmosphere feels more intense.  Soon enough a bunch of wild boars (or alien versions of boars) charge through the forest!  One or two shots isn't enough to take them out either.  They are very dangerous and I'm surprised the gang survives.  Hang in there Alice!

Then it gets crazier!  There's disappearing aliens that the group stumbles upon.  They've made a campground for themselves.  I'd say the aliens are pretty scary overall.  And in fact this movie is fantastic. Intense and mysterious with top notch acting.  Surprised again to see Topher in a film like this but his character works.  Can all these characters figure out why they're there?  Watch it to find out.",1471392000,,3408,4.704081632653061

4031568,5,B002ZG98LO,"Just finished watching ""Predators"" released by 20th Century Fox.
Predators is a superior, perhaps truer sequel to the original Predator movie that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger - in his acting prime - than Predator 2 was or the weak AVP movies that failed at the box office when they were released.
Predators kicks off the action as an unconscious man with no name or identification tags is falling through a vast open sky.  He wakes up, realizes he's falling and starts to panic, searching for a way to open the parachute that's is harnessed on his back.  He finally gets it open and crash lands through the multi-layered treetops of an unknown jungle.  He quickly meets up with other survivors who have no memory of how they arrived where they are.  They sense they are being hunted and discover that they are on an alien planet.  After that discovery they are slowly picked off one-by-one.
A tense, action packed movie.
Highly Recommended!

It included an ex-military mercenary, a Mexican drug cartel enforcer, a Spetsnaz soldier, an Israel Defense Forces sniper,a Revolutionary United Front officer, a death row inmate, a Yakuza enforcer, and a serial killer.

At first these individuals hadn't any idea what was happening. They considered explanations from their backgrounds - kidnapped for ransom, military tests, drugs, behavioral experiments - none made any sense. Each had been in high risk situations before being brought there, they briefly wondered if they were already dead and in Hell. Soon enough they found themselves not only being hunted, but also caught in a blood feud between 2 different Predator Clans.

This gives fans: Predator vs Yakusa. Predator vs Soldiers. Predator vs Predator. It also introduces the audience to Predator Hunting Dogs. In the climax, the mercenary lures a massive Predator into an ambush. He set the area around him on fire, the intense heat blinds the Predator.

 Sequels are sometimes successful, often not.  This is the fifth in the Predator series, which alone would give pause to a ticket buyer.  The original is the only movie to feature two future state governors, Jesse Ventura and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  For my money, this is the best of the bunch.  Thank Robert Rodriguez, the current king of chaos, for his efforts as executive producer.
 Director Nimrod Antal has his chance at fame after three trips to the plate with little success.  His future is assured with this thriller that really thrills.
 The film begins with star Adrien Brody (Oscar winner for The Pianist) falling through the sky.  He gains consciousness in time to open his parachute and land safely in a thick jungle.  In short order, others join him.  Danny Trejo, a staple actor in Rodriguez films, is a drug cartel hit man.  Others include a condemned mass murderer played with eerie Veritas by Walton
Goggins (The Shield, Justified), Alice Braga as a beautiful Israeli sniper and Topher Grace of That 70s Show who plays a creepy serial killer.  Laurence Fishburne has a brilliant, but short, part as a mad survivor.  The parachutists eventually discover that all of them, a Japanese gangster, a mercenary, a Russian special forces soldier, are Predators in one way or another.  But this time, they are the prey.
 The hunter species known only as Predator has snatched the humans and dumped them onto a planet wide game preserve where they are the game.  From the first moments in free fall until the last glimpse of the sky, the film rolls at a murderous pace.  This is thriller film making at its heart stopping best.  The various monsters are scary, fast and ferocious.  The heroes are gimlet eyed killers who judge each situation with the care of professional gamblers sizing up a mark.  But they do it on the jump.  The action scenes are superb.  The characters are one dimensional, but they are true to their various callings.  As the star, and as the Oscar winner, Brody has the only character that really lives long enough to have a satisfying personality change.
 This is a very good movie of its kind.  There are the nice little touches here and there that we like, good effects and terrifying danger experienced at a full gallop.  Huzzah.  We can take pride in our species as at least a strong contender for the title of baddest beings in the Galaxy.
 Four slashing saw blades for this R (loads of violence, very bad language) rated space/thriller.  It runs one hour and 47 frightening minutes.",1445731200,,2533,4.767281105990784

Adrien Brody is a star.  He has masculinity and authority; and he has a sturdiness and intelligence that surpasses many action stars.  The mismatched team works perfectly.  They are a soldiers and a felon and a gang member, and they are all at odds.  On earth, they would be enemies.  But here, they have no choice.

Love the special effects, and the formidability of the predators, who are so cold-blooded, they hunt other predators.

4032047,4,B002ZG98LO,"Even if this wasn't part of the ""Predator"" franchise, it makes for a good action film.

A group of people find themselves together in a jungle, snatched from whatever they were doing and most falling through space, luckily with parachutes attached. They soon discover they're on an alien planet, brought there to be prey for a group of hunters. Most seem well-equipped...special forces soldiers, a drug cartel enforcer, a condemned prisoner, a member of the Yakuza. Only one is out of place, a doctor transported as he was on his way to work. They struggle to understand where they are, then band together to try and outwit the enemy. Then they find one of the hunters, bound and tied as if lure for their prey and scheme to free him in order to help them escape...

Some of the cinematography in this is striking, such as the battle between the Yakuza and the hunter, with the tall grasses sweeping around them more like green currents of water instead of plants. The first view giving a clue that the terrain is alien, with four moons in the sky, is also quite breath-taking.  There aren't many special effects, other than explosions and the ascent of the alien space ship, however.

The story is pretty straight forward: elude the killers and find a way to escape. No explanation is given as to why the one hunter is ostracized by his companions, though there is animosity between him and their leader but we have to guess at the reason. The aliens ain't telling.

Even if this movie had been released under another title without the ""predator"" inference, it could stand on its own merits as a good action/sci-fi film.

4033041,4,B002ZG98LO,"I came across this while browsing Amazon and thought, why not?  I liked the first Predator and I had remembered hearing about this one a few years ago but never got the chance to see it.

It was actually pretty good.  I think they made a good call with casting Adrien Brody because if they had cast someone who was a well-known action star, this movie could have been seen as a re-make instead of an addition to the franchise.  The predators are, of course, scary and aggressive.  The effects are great and you'll be reminded of all of the things you loved from the first Predator.

The basic premise: A group of people wake up as they're being parachuted into some unknown land.  They're from all over the world, and none of them know each other.  They soon realize that they're not alone, and this may not be Earth.

I don't want to give too much away.  Things heat up pretty quickly and it makes for a very exciting film.  I am left with questions about the predators, of course, but I think the point is that we're supposed to know as much as the characters know instead of being omnipotent film-watchers.  The characters know very little, and by the end of the movie, you still don't know very much about the terrain or the Predators themselves.  If we knew everything about the Predators, they wouldn't be so mysterious and interesting, would they?

This is definitely worth a watch, especially if you enjoy any of the Predator series!",1426550400,4,1441,4.513513513513513

I gave it 4 stars because the movie has a very good plot and as a sequel of the predator franchise (does it count as a sequel?) is really worthy, but if I counted the nightmare of quality of streaming that amazon provided on it, I would have given it just one.

The novelty of the concept has been eroded by the regrettable sequels, and the very existence of the fun, but stupid original.

4033698,3,B002ZG98LO,"I had never watched anything from the Predator trilogy , so this was my first experience with this franchise. It was really just an ""okay"" film. The acting was great from all the characters (esp from Brody), the filming location was wonderful, special effects were superb and the overall ""Feel"" of the movie was nice. There were a few points, however, that were disappointing. Mainly, I felt like there were plot holes and unexplained occurrences. I didn't understand the relatively short (an unnecessary) role of Laurence Fishburne halfway through the movie. He started to explain to the group about the differentiating factors between the predators (as if one was more evolved than the other). But then he just kind of stopped. I would have like the director, Robert Rodriguez, to go into a bit more detail about the predator culture and what ways it influenced how each group chose to hunt. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILER ARLERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would have also liked a bit more background on who authorized these individuals to be drugged and dropped out of a plane in the middle of a strange planet. The very last scene of the film, two survivors are shown walking in the middle of the forest and they stop to notice *more* people (and Predators in boxes) are being dropped out of mysterious planes . Where are these people coming from? What's the ultimate goal of this game? Who is flying these planes?

4033703,3,B002ZG98LO,"Here's the thing...the 'Alien' & 'Predator' (sci-fi creature franchises) are cult-specific. You may like one, or other, or both. There are guys in very clever suits which make them scary. And the film-maker's art is to convince you that humans havn't a chance in their stories. (well,..most humans). So, either the creature is indestructibly nasty for some reason, else it has advanced weapons that don't need batteries and can cut through anything you got. So...
  The good guys suddenly find themselves parachuting onto an alien world (...please don't ask how...). But they're pretty tough. And they are armed with good weapons. And Lawrence Fishburn shows-up suddenly like a park-ranger & guide with one of the alien weapons. And he has shelter. So things are looking up. But he talks to his invisible friend (so he's out of his mind). It seems as if they missed-out on a rare opportunity here.
  If they had asked me, the story would have been about Fishburn (without Harvey the invisible rabbit), and Brody ~just two~ against one creature- and the subsequent drama would have been an absolutely riveting, less-expensive cult-classic.",1410048000,,1138,5.102150537634409

4034025,2,B002ZG98LO,"This film is barely halfway decent action, and very little else. I appreciate the attempt to rekindle the feel of the original Predator with the jungle setting, but so much of that film's effect came from its artistic restraint and suspense. Predators brings together a good group of actors--Brody, Braga and Fishburne especially--and has a legitimate premise, but something is missing. There is very little sense of awe. It is closer to a typical monster-ish action film, and unfortunately the action is not great. There are some cheap CGI creatures and choppy fight sequences that keep this from being as satisfying an experience as it could have been. Also, the visual ""look""/""aspect"" is rather on the cheap side. In my mind, this does not add any great net value to the Predator franchise. What Predators has going for it, primarily, is grittiness. Don't expect too much, and you may enjoy it.",1405209600,,897,4.947019867549669

If you don't like Predators, don't watch it. I read other comments saying that they were going to give it a chance to see I it was a good movie, expecting not to like it.

4034027,5,B002ZG98LO,"2010 brought Lawrence Fishburne and Adrian Brody into the future of Predator.  Aw-nuld's 1987 film scared the bejeesus out of movie goers.  2010 made the monster accessible.  Danny Trejo (Machete), Walton Goggins (The Shield), Brazilian bombshell Alice Braga, and Topher Grace (Spiderman 3) help round out the crew.

The main characters were all kidnapped and dropped off on what seems to be a game preserve, only humans are the game.  What all the ""contestants"" have in common is they are cold blooded killers from various segments of military and civilian fields.

4034170,3,B002ZG98LO,"I am a big fan of aliens and predator and this movie is just ok.  Here is what's wrong with it:

1. minimal character development
(ok by me in a monster movie).

2. the characters are not believable
(there is a group of people composed of military members and hardened criminals who are being hunted by the predators.  The military people are fine to have people wonder off from the group and to leave all of their comrades to die or even to sacrifice them to save themselves.  Also it doesn't really seem like sacrificing them is going to help anything.  Further, the hardened criminals start to sacrifice themselves to save others for no apparent reason.  One minute they're a G who just left everyone to die.  The next they are nodding at the others and running into the fray on their own as their friends run away.  It's almost like ""oh is it my turn to die next, ok save me a bear claw in the break trailer."")

3. the two plot twists involve characters acting totally out of conformity with what little bit of character they had spent the entire movie developing.  Characters defecting from being total psychopaths in life to sacrificing their lives to save others comes to be expected after the 3rd time it happens so I can't count these as plot twists.

4. No interesting action scenes
(except for the very ending which was largely stolen from the original predator and just isn't as good.  also several lines of dialogue are stolen from Arnold which is also not as good.  The scenes are just clich&eacute;s with no suspense.  Predator gets punched over object, then disappears and comes up behind the puncher.  How can that happen?  He was less than 5 feet away from you?  The only cool scene was stolen from the opening of Ninja Gaiden on the 8-bit Nintendo).

5.  Topher Grace delivers all of his lines with the same bored stoner tone and inflection of Eric in ""That 70's Show,"" although he has the most complex character.  This is to say that he cannot act and merely reads his lines as himself, but if you have seen him before you knew that.  Anyway, he just kind of ruins any level of immersion you could possibly have with the movie because even if you don't recognize him you will have this nagging feeling of trying to place him in whatever you saw him in.  Not that there was much here to ruin, but still.

But it's better than predator 2, so I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.

I don't understand why they even need characters and dialogue.  Why don't they focus on believable fight scene coriagrpahy or special effects and just write the script around that?  It seems like this, Prometheus, and predators v. aliens movies are just trying to re-hash (or cash in) on these old franchises without actually re-making them (which is good because they would ruin the originals).",1402099200,,2788,4.5350701402805615
4034171,5,B002ZG98LO,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked the look and feel of the movie.  It took me back to the original.  The plot was good, the special effects were right on point.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1401840000,,205,4.17948717948718
4034172,5,B002ZG98LO,Nice intensity great actors and great back ups once again you guys made movie night awesome. Adrian Brody goes hamn,1401667200,,115,4.8
4034173,3,B002ZG98LO,"I watched Predators (2010) last night. It was about how the alien ""predator"" creatures magically whisk away some of Earth's biggest bad asses and land them on another planet that they use as their private hunting grounds. The Predators kill humans for sport. But they get more than they bargained for as a couple of humans are still alive after the last Predator is killed. The human group includes various trained killers from the military and organized crime.

The only way to enjoy the movie was to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the battle strategies and personal interactions among the various tough guys, gals, and alien dog creatures and predators. Thinking beyond this limted scope brought up too many unanswerable questions regarding the plausibility of any of this.

What did I like? I liked the various booby traps and self-defense measures taken by the combatants. In the modern world people have gotten too soft. It's important to at least fantasize about what it takes to survive under adversity. In a survival situation you find that not everyone makes it out alive. Adrien Brody's character (an ex-black ops guy) makes the call that Danny Trejo (drug cartel guy) is in a trap that will kill them all if they rescue him, so he decides to let him die rather than save him. Alice Braga (Guatemalan death squad survivor) shoots him to give him a merciful death (though we find that he was already dead, and that the calls for help in his own voice were being made by a nearby Predator). Another character is injured and then booby trapped to kill a Predator. We find that he was a bad guy and not deserving of life anyway, but still it was a difficult decision to make so that others could survive. A couple of characters go on suicide missions to kill Predators and are successful, though they too died in the process. This kind of heroism, though deadly, has its inspiration.

What didn't I like? How did these omniscient Predators know who the baddest people on Earth are so that they could bring them in a flash of light to another solar system's planet? Only Godlike powers could know that a guy on death row in a federal prison for rape should be selected as ""game."" Apparently, every few weeks more ""game"" are dropped via parachutes over the alien planet to be hunted. All the characters remember is a burst of light but nothing else about their instantaneous transfer across millions of light years. If the creatures are so powerful as to move effortlessly across the universe, wouldn't their tastes and pasttimes evolve as well? Would they still be addicted to such base acts of sadism and domination? That is a scary thought. Some people argue that the nuclear weaponized humanity of 2014 is no more evolved than the Neanderthals of past eons. I used to think that the brutality of the Middle Ages with its witch burnings and mass killings of tribal peoples was a thing of the past. But then I see our heavy metal ladened skies and the genetic altering of our food supply and I know that not only has nothing changed, but things have gotten worse. The characters were pretty much two-dimensional. But what do you expect in a videogame-like movie? I prefer more depth and intelligence in my science fiction. This movie was more of an action/horror flick. I learned about a plant that secreted a paralyzing fluid; but how was the doctor so familiar with it if this was truly an alien planet?

4034347,4,B002ZG98LO,"SPOILER WARNING

""Predators"" is a surprisingly good sequel to ""Predator"" and ""Predator 2"". Good, that is, if you like blood, gore, more gore and odd aliens with a penchant for bounty hunting. In the two classical movies, the Predators arrived on our planet to kill Arnie and LAPD's finest.

In this super-sequel, the masked aliens turn out to have a weird sense of morality. They capture evil humans of the kind we would rather get rid of anyway, transport them to a distant planet in another solar system, and hunt them for sport. Thus, most of the ""heroes"" in ""Predators"" turn out to be predators themselves: Mafiosi, mercenaries, sociopaths, war criminals... The only sympathetic type is an Israeli. Are the Predators anti-Zionist, since they hunt Israelis for sport?

There are several plot twists. It turns out that there are actually two species (or castes?) of alien Predators. The ""classical"" Predators, who stalked humanity in the first two films, turn out to be the *lower* caste. Ooops!

""Predators"" end inconclusively, with the survivors watching as a new group of unwilling recruits for the hunt are parachuted down from an alien sky... This story cries out for a sequel, and for once, I'm almost willing to wait for it! Four stars. Did I mention the gore?",1393718400,,1269,4.91588785046729

4034468,2,B002ZG98LO,"I didn't enjoy this the first time I watched this, but as I'd watched the first two films today I thought I'd complete the set. Compared to the first two films it's rubbish, as a film in its own right it's ok (if you squint and have a little snooze mid way through).

We start the film falling from the sky, this time we're not on Earth, prize candidates for the hunt are taken from their home worlds and dropped onto this world to be hunted. A group of humans, all expert killers (except one, a doctor who stands out a bit) from around the world find themselves in the same predicament. Luckily for them they get to keep their weapons which come in handy quite quickly.

The film has an annoying trait of taking scenes from the first film and recreating them with the new cast, this isn't a re-shoot of the first film though, it just takes a few snatches here and there. The biggest issue for me was the group, there's a mix of characters there, but I didn't like any of them. In the previous films you rooted for the team being hunted, but there's nothing sympathetic here. They were handy in a fight, but had no other redeeming feature and more importantly there's no real chemistry between them.

It also has some very silly parts (I know that might seem an odd thing to say about a film about alien hunters), the sword fight, the recluse and the big reveal, none of them added anything of use, or even fun to the film.

For me the other problem was what it did with the Predators, I'm happy that there's different factions, but why do the bad ones look so ridiculous compared to the original. Watching two predators fight should also have been more awesome than what was shown here.

It does manage on the balance to be moderately entertaining, but only by the skin of its teeth. And in fairness it's gets a harder time than usual from me because it is so poor compared to the previous films, but you would be better served by watching them.",1388880000,,1946,4.349862258953168

The predators in this movie are rather undisciplined. If you were familiar with the EU you might call them 'Bad Bloods'. This is a big break from the 'ha-ha i've got such an upper hand i'll let you run' kind of guy. Also, there's too many of them in this film. In the other films, they kept whittling the number down to one predator. So that you could have this walking gore generator.

Now, there are too many. Yes, only three, but still too many. I don't like the new art direction, don't like the weapons. The characters weren't too bad. Some worth taking a deeper look at, most aren't. Some things exploded, but it wasn't enough to redeem this film.

4034642,2,B002ZG98LO,"Predators(released July/10)is a very luke warm addition to the Predator franchise by producer Rodrigues. It stars,among others,Adrien Brody,Topher Grace,Alice Braga,Walton Goggins,Danny Trejo and Lawrence Fishburne. Unless someone has a bit more imagination than this and the last group of writers of the series,then this franchise is essentially dead in the water. And what a shame as it has SO much potential. I thought at least Rodrigues would do a half decent job,but boy was I wrong.
The story starts as Brody is free falling to Earth. Just in time his parachute opens,but his landing is still a rough one. Eventually eight others join him. Some are former armed forces personnel but others range from a death row inmate to a doctor. None know why they are there or where ""where"" is. They wander around the jungle-like environment until they come to the edge of the forest and discover three planets in the sky. They are definitely not on Earth. It is soon after the group get attacked by dog-like creatures that sport deadly spikes. They manage to kill most of them,until the last ones are recalled back by a high pitched sound. Brody comes to the conclusion they are in a game preserve of sorts and they are the prey.
The group later enter a clearing in which they find a Predator tied up to a tall stake. Suddenly a bigger Predator attacks and the second victim from the group falls. Later in the jungle, Fishburne appears offering the group shelter. He takes them to an abandoned space craft where he has lived for about 10 years. He talks to an imaginary friend,but reveals that the predators have a feud going between the bigger and smaller ones. During the night he tries to kill the group,but Brody attracts the predators who kill Fishburne. They escape into the jungle and while fleeing three of the group die by sacrificing themselves and killing the same amount of predators. They go back to the clearing and cut down the small predator on the stake. Brody motions that he wants the predator to help them all escape by piloting the predator ship. The alien sets the ship on automatic pilot but then is killed by a larger predator.
While running to the ship, the doctor gets injured but Braga won't leave him. Brody carries on and appears to leave on the alien ship. The large predator sees the ship leaving and remotely blows it up. The doctor meanwhile has incapacitated Braga and is about to kill her when Brody shows up and saves her. Brody uses the doctor as bait(loading him with explosives)and lures a predator in,but the resultant explosion only stuns the predator. But it's enough for Brody to eventually get the upper hand and kill it. After the fight more people start parachuting in,as the scenario seems to be starting all over again. Brody tells Braga that they should keep looking for a way off the planet. Fade out.
Right,as if that will ever happen after what they have just been through! The plot is a meandering fiasco,is it goes from one pointless moment to another,and none of them generating any kind of excitement. Remember,we have had two other predator movies before,not counting the Alien VS series. We KNOW what they look like and how they hunt. In fact the only thing we didn't know was that there was an in-fighting thing going on between different parts of their species...big deal. Other than that,it was all old territory;the attack with their razor claws,their cloaking in and out,their mimicking of human speech,their ability to see in different light spectrum's,etc,etc. It is all been there,done that stuff;no originality in a truck load. There was a quick reference by Braga back to the first movie;said the Volkswagen about the Cadillac! Boy,how I yearned that this stinker was half as good as that.
Technically speaking this film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,commentary and some prequel motion-comics.
In conclusion the Predator franchise continues to speed up in its downhill descent. The efforts by Rodrigues and his crew fail to slow its speed. This is a dull sequel that no more furthers the series than I do. 2 1/2 - 3 stars.",1383609600,,4144,4.789106145251397

4034873,3,B002ZG98LO,"Predators is an homage to the original 1987 Predator. The whole project is a nod to the original film and utilizes many scenes to illustrate its lineage. The writers seemed to want to distance themselves from the very poorly done AVP movies and even Predator 2 to a certain extent.  The distancing from AVP was the very best thing the writers could possibly do for the film. However, the exclusion of the lineage of Predator 2 alienates the original film's direct sequel making it an orphan; this harms the overall continuity of the franchise, but this is what Hollywood likes to do today!
 I saw this movie in theaters during the summer and honestly it is just a fun and amusing movie. It does not compare in quality to the original 2 films, but the imagination of the story is what drives it. All the characters are over the top and clich (Adrian Brody is certainly no Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Topher Grace is just plain silly. But the film is a departure from the AVP's which took the series down a very dark path of awfulness and brings back the hot jungle feel of the original movie.
Honestly, Predator 3 could have been many things, hypothetically, it could have been much better, but also judging from other movies it could have been much, much worse.

4034953,4,B002ZG98LO,Many of the other reviewers have captured the gist of the story line and most have referenced the obvious flashback to the original as this instalment returns to the jungle. I don't have anything bad to say about the acting. I felt the cast all worked well together and enjoyed the plot. They could have built more into the use of additional alien creatures but they chose not to. They could have built more on the internal predator war but they chose not to. There were a few holes in the continuity like an early reference to the sun not moving but then later it becomes night. Also... one of the characters knowing so much about the flora of an alien planet seemed a bit of a leap... but then again... the fact that they were on an alien planet sort of renders that moot anyway. All in all not a bad addition to the saga. Certainly opens the door to future follow ups. They really could build a great sequel if they take the time to think it through (of course that doesn't always happen).

4034955,4,B002ZG98LO,"Wow! Alot of reviewers are apparently not happy with this latest installment of the Predators franchise.
Which I find odd because this movie takes place on the Preds game reserve planet and not on boring Earth and I kinda feel as though that was the logical next step as far a venues go.
Also lots of people are mad that it's not like the first one and I admit Adrien Brody is no Arnold but I can't help but feel as though these people would only be truly happy if they managed to get Arnold, Carl Weathers and Jesse to scene by scene re-inacted the first movie and package it as a new Predators movie.
I like to call these people the Impossibles, as in impossible to please.
Adrien Brody did fine as the main tough guy and the rest all pulled their own acting wise.
I do recognize the forced in female lead aspect but got over it pretty quickly as it would appear that women have been allowed in the military for some time now.
Special effects are pretty good and nothing there to complain about.
We get a glimpse of Predator social behavior and turns out there two diffenrent types out there.
One we've seen in the other movies and a bigger version that almost come off as either the full grown version or just a compelety separate sub-species.
That wasn't explained very thouroughly but maybe in the next installment they will elaborate on that.
In a nutshell, I found thist to be pretty competent follow up and one last little barb at the Impossibles, and this is in direct reference to the mud shield that they are saying was a blatant copy cat of the first movie...it would appear that that would not have worked for covering up body heat...Mythbuster tested it and Busted.
So it would seem that the first one has it's issues with reality as well but does that mean I like the first one less?
Hell no, it's a frigging alien movie so go with it and enjoy the ride and stop comparing everything to the first one.

4035180,5,B002ZG98LO,"This is a great film. I'm giving it 5 stars because it added such a cool storyline to the Predator franchise, and was consistently fun and highly entertaining throughout the movie. It never slows down, yet isn't frantic or over done. True it didn't break much new ground, but it did add new elements to the Predator. Possibly a sequel will allow the overall plot to develop so we can find out where the Predator came from, maybe go to the home planet, maybe start an all out intergalactic war or something. Hell, let's set it in the future and get Star Trek in on it! Engage. Ok maybe not. This movie is highly re-watchable. People complain about movies like this, but ultimately they are great additions that expand the story for fans. If it is on TV, it stays on that channel. This is the test of how good it was (for me at least). Replay value. Predator 2 wasn't a bad sequel, but I find it so far removed in style from the original it doesn't feel like a sequel. Still a good movie but I find if it is on I'll get bored after a bit.. The whole AVP thing is all over the map, and the Alien sequels after Aliens were pretty mediocre as well. I've seen them all multiple times and none of them (AVP or Aliens 3/4 really stand out). So this movie and Prometheus (and of no relation to Prometheus) breath life back into both franchises. Small *SPOILER* alert: there are some cheesy lines... ""We're gonna need another plan"".. etc, but the original was loaded with them. That actually is what helps create the connection. What is cooler though than a Yakuza samurai fighting a Predator with a samurai sword?? That was badass! I wait for this scene every time I watch it (and yeah it is basically a rip of Billy Sole's (the Native American) knife fight from the original though much cooler). And then there is the demented Lawrence Fishburne appearance. Another awesome sci-fi with L. Fishburne. Enough said.

4035361,4,B002ZG98LO,"One of the biggest problems I had with ""Predator 2"" was that it abandoned the atmosphere of the original ""Predator"" movie. As for the AvP movies, forget it.

Well, ""Predators"" has a completely different cast and setting from the original... yet it successfully captures that grimy, sweaty, blood-stained jungle quality. The difference this time is that all the humans are also vicious killers of one kind or another, and strong performances by Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne and the rest keep us invested despite the nastiness of some characters.

Eight people find themselves parachuted into an unknown jungle: Royce, an American mercenary (Brody); Isabelle, an IDF sniper (Braga); Hanzo, a yakuza enforcer (Louis Ozawa Changchien); Nikolai, a Spetsnatz soldier (Oleg Taktarov); Mombasa, a Sierra Leone death squad member (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); Cuchillo, a cruel cartel thug (Danny Trejo); Stans, a serial killer on death row (Walton Goggins), and a seeming harmless doctor named Edwin (Topher Grace).

At first, the eight people have no idea who they are doing there, or how they came to be there. They have even more questions when they realize that this jungle isn't even on Earth.

But that isn't their biggest problem: someone is following them through the jungle, and slaughtering these seasoned killers one by one. Also, there's a crazy guy (Laurence Fishburne) who may be a lot more dangerous than he seems. Their only chance of survival is to somehow kill the alien Predators that are following them -- assuming they don't kill each other first.

When I first heard of ""Predators,"" my first thought was that it sounded more like a remake than a sequel. But it does successfully twiddle the original formula -- the humans are all professional killers, none of them know each other, and there is no safe haven for them unless they are able to somehow get a spaceship. Even the ""obfuscate the heat vision"" scene is turned on its head.

But at the same time, director Nimrd Antal and producer Robert Rodrieguez GET it. They know why the original movie worked, and they successfully twiddle the formula without losing what makes it good. The story is simple and mostly straightforward (with a few easy-to-predict twists), with the sweaty, bloodstained atmosphere of people trapped in the jungle.

The one big problem? Well, halfway through the movie we're introduced to the idea that there are different breeds of Predator, and they hunt each other as well as other species... it's never explained enough. It's a bit confusing.

I was initially skeptical of the casting of tall, skinny Adrien Brody as the lead character, but he's frankly pretty awesome -- a lean, wiry, cold-as-ice guy who has a soft spot for ""nice"" people. The gravelly Batman voice is a little off-putting, though. We get it, you're tough.

And the other actors all do brilliant jobs, fleshing out their characters -- each one gets pros and cons to their personality, no matter how repulsive they may be. Braga and Taktarov are especially good as the only ""good"" people in the group, who seem to have stable compassionate personalities, while Changchien manages to make a likable, interesting character out of only a handful of lines and a truly awesome kendo duel. And yes, Grace has a wonderfully chilling performance set apart from the assorted soldiers and enforcers.

""Predators"" catches the tone and atmosphere of the original ""Predator,"" then twists around the entire formula. Brilliant acting and a simple, solid story.",1363737600,,3520,5.07439446366782

Well, ""Predators"" has a completely different cast and setting from the original... yet it successfully captures that grimy, sweaty, blood-stained jungle quality. The difference this time is that all the humans are also vicious killers of one kind or another, and strong performances by Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne and the rest keep us invested despite the nastiness of some characters.

Eight people find themselves parachuted into an unknown jungle: Royce, an American mercenary (Brody); Isabelle, an IDF sniper (Braga); Hanzo, a yakuza enforcer (Louis Ozawa Changchien); Nikolai, a Spetsnatz soldier (Oleg Taktarov); Mombasa, a Sierra Leone death squad member (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); Cuchillo, a cruel cartel thug (Danny Trejo); Stans, a serial killer on death row (Walton Goggins), and a seeming harmless doctor named Edwin (Topher Grace).

At first, the eight people have no idea who they are doing there, or how they came to be there. They have even more questions when they realize that this jungle isn't even on Earth.

But that isn't their biggest problem: someone is following them through the jungle, and slaughtering these seasoned killers one by one. Also, there's a crazy guy (Laurence Fishburne) who may be a lot more dangerous than he seems. Their only chance of survival is to somehow kill the alien Predators that are following them -- assuming they don't kill each other first.

When I first heard of ""Predators,"" my first thought was that it sounded more like a remake than a sequel. But it does successfully twiddle the original formula -- the humans are all professional killers, none of them know each other, and there is no safe haven for them unless they are able to somehow get a spaceship. Even the ""obfuscate the heat vision"" scene is turned on its head.

But at the same time, director Nimrd Antal and producer Robert Rodrieguez GET it. They know why the original movie worked, and they successfully twiddle the formula without losing what makes it good. The story is simple and mostly straightforward (with a few easy-to-predict twists), with the sweaty, bloodstained atmosphere of people trapped in the jungle.

The one big problem? Well, halfway through the movie we're introduced to the idea that there are different breeds of Predator, and they hunt each other as well as other species... it's never explained enough. It's a bit confusing.

I was initially skeptical of the casting of tall, skinny Adrien Brody as the lead character, but he's frankly pretty awesome -- a lean, wiry, cold-as-ice guy who has a soft spot for ""nice"" people. The gravelly Batman voice is a little off-putting, though. We get it, you're tough.

And the other actors all do brilliant jobs, fleshing out their characters -- each one gets pros and cons to their personality, no matter how repulsive they may be. Braga and Taktarov are especially good as the only ""good"" people in the group, who seem to have stable compassionate personalities, while Changchien manages to make a likable, interesting character out of only a handful of lines and a truly awesome kendo duel. And yes, Grace has a wonderfully chilling performance set apart from the assorted soldiers and enforcers.

""Predators"" catches the tone and atmosphere of the original ""Predator,"" then twists around the entire formula. Brilliant acting and a simple, solid story.",1363478400,,3520,5.07439446366782

It is not really a reboot or sequel so much as an exploration of a new story, even though it does have roots referrenced back to the original movie. The cast is capable but not matched up to their roles well and the director does not use them wisely. He is the reall problem, in that he does not have a clear vision of what this movie should be and the direction it should go in. It is slow in the wrong places and too skimpy in others where it needs more depth. Overall this is not as good as the first movie. As a home rental it was okay and had its moments. But at the theater, it was a disappointment. This new trip to the hunting grounds of this sci-fy series was under developed and left a watered down taste in your mouth.

4035761,4,B002ZG98LO,"I have to be honest, I am a Predator fan but only to the extent of the first film. Since then there have been 3 films featuring the Predator and they've all been terrible. Having said that I was pretty skeptical about this new Predator incarnation, even with Robert Rodriguez, who has done some killer flicks (Sin City, Planet Terror etc), overseeing the production. I was particularly shocked after seeing that Topher Grace had been cast, fearing yet again (Spider-man 3) he was miscast. Although in the end he was a little more than just comic relief, cool twist. I also thought the generally soft-spoken Adrien Brody, who can be an excellent actor, was miscast as `Arnold Schwarzenegger'. First off nobody can take Arnie's place in the world of Predator, Brody could pull of badass but he couldn't pull off Schwarzenegger badass.

The dialogue was pretty generic (not uncommon in action flicks) probably should have stuck with the script Rodriguez originally wrote. One of the things I loved, particularly in Blu-Ray, was the aesthetics, the sceneries almost did make you feel like *spoiler alert* you were on another planet. All of the sound effects of the Predator were incredible the in camera make up (not CG) was awesome. On a final note, the film couldn't escape the horror movie formula of *spoiler alert again* killing almost everyone in the film off besides who you think wouldn't die, I do want to give Larry Fishburne mad props, he may not be known as much else besides Morpheus but *final spoiler alert* he was probably the best actor in the film.",1356393600,2,1562,4.806691449814126

Problem I have with Predators, is even though I thought it was very well made and very original. It could've been soooo much better. I like when movies tie into each other. And this could've tied into the earlier films allot. Since Predator 2, Aliens and Predators have been mixed and tied together which started the AVP franchise. Here's how I would have tied it in. In this story, people get abducted to this planet so the predators can hunt them like wild game. My thoughts were, if you survived and beat a predator...you also got abducted to do battle with the Predators. The dead solider in the beginning could have been Arnold. That could've ended that story there...And Lawrence Fishburne could have been played by Danny Glover. This could have tied Predator 1 & 2 even more so then just Alice Braga's character.

4035937,1,B002ZG98LO,"Let's do this in list format, since this film is sort of designed to be nothing more than what it claims to be.

The most serious problems of the film are:
- The so-called ""elite killers"" that go up against the Predators sure don't seem it, and that alone ruins the entire purpose for which most people saw this film, like me. They show little intelligence or experience, walk straight into traps, and neither talk nor think like someone used to killing for a living would do. They might as well have been nobodies given a gun, since they very rarely show any skill in what they're supposed to be able to do. Call me on it if I'm wrong, but are people such as these, who are said to be ruthless killing machines, usually not-so-eager to join up and become a ragtag group of buddies, really this nice and trusting among each other?
- Even though they realize what they are, where they are, and why they're there, not a single person questions the one person who claims to literally be the opposite of an elite killer: a freaking doctor who says he was on his way to work, who is totally unarmed the entire time, and is completely inept in combat. Seriously, not one of them thinks that's a little weird, even though they know the rest of them are acclimated to extreme violence and murder?
- Cool! Laurence Fishburne is an elite survivalist who's been doing this for ten of their hunting seasons and survived! Easily the most badass character in the group who actually knows what he's doing, unlike everyone else, you almost think he's going to save the movie from being as boring as it's been so far. Except...
- ...Fishburne instead gets maybe ten minutes total of screen time doing nothing but talking before being killed in a way that makes you wonder how he could have possibly lasted as long as he claims he did. Well, so much for Fishburne saving the movie as the only character who seems to have any idea what he's doing.
- Terribly generic musical score that lacks any suspense at all, so bad that it's worth noting. I'm not expecting an OST here, but come on. I don't think I'll ever understand why they chose an old happy dance song for the ending credits, which had nothing to do with anything that just happened. I was kind of expecting something a little more serious, not a cartoon, which is what it basically is.
- The death row inmate, apparently just a sexual predator (possibly an inside joke of sorts), who talks about doing cocaine and raping women for fun--well, you'd just kind of make the connection that he's probably a psychopath who is not nice to anyone. He probably wouldn't help out the team much, and if it were me, I'd have shot him first for clearly having no intentions of helping anyone out. Anyone who talks that crazy in front of everyone is not even a smart psychopath, so he's probably going to use any opportunity he can to let the Predators take everyone else, like a psychopath would tend to do before being killed himself. Instead, he ends up being...heroic? And genuinely nice from there on out? What? A serial rapist who probably killed at least one of his victims (it's never explicitly stated that he killed anyone, but he *was* on death row, so it's not exactly a stretch) ends up being heroic, the only one most likely to betray absolutely everyone at the drop of a hat?
- A laughably stereotypical Yakuza character who fakes not being able to speak English...dies in the most laughably stereotypical way imaginable.
- It just can't seem to take itself seriously. The majority of the film is our cast of people who seem to be picked at random and showing no skill at killing talking a whole lot.
- Everything about it is boring, from the characters to the environment to the Predators themselves. There just aren't any moments of real excitement.

Also, as a last note, the trailer is a lie. Scenes are in the trailer that are not in the movie. The obvious emphasis on Laurence Fishburne, who does pretty much absolutely nothing except say a few lines before being killed off (apparently this film had an even lower budget than I imagined), is nothing short of deception in the advertising of the film. Audiences generally don't appreciate that kind of thing, although it's common.

Definitely not recommended for absolutely anyone, even if you like the concept of it, Predator fan or not. Don't be drawn in by the great idea here; it doesn't actually occur in the film.",1350864000,8,4418,4.561712846347607

None of the characters are terribly deep or all that complex and could even be accused of being rather two-dimensional, but for a fun action/horror film like this I'd argue they really don't need to be.

Predator 2 was a reasonably worthy successor but the later ""Alien versus Predator"" things, not so much. The ""Most Dangerous Game"" duel-between-masters aspect just wasn't there. This movie brings back the original idea, with humans of varying degrees of training and temperament - scary muscle guys, loony-tunes serial killers, top-class mercenary, Yakuza and IDF leader types, a guy who's survived being hunted for years, and one Hannibal Lecter wannabe - suddenly finding themselves on a planet perfectly adapted as a hunting environment. They're hunted by a small team of the alien SOB race and quickly realize that hunting the aliens is the only possible way to survive. Very tense, very complicated (which of the other humans can be trusted?) and lots of fun - more complex than the original and with great special effects.

4036047,4,B002ZG98LO,"Admittedly, it took me too long to see the first two Predator films. I actually saw them both after Director Nimrod Antal and Producer Robert Rodriguez's sequel. This one is nothing compared to the first film, but it's a hell of a lot better than Predator 2 and the AVP films. It isn't anything to write home about, but I'd say Predators is decent entertainment. I looked forward to it since the day I heard it was in production, and since I didn't have anything to compare it to besides the AVPs, I didn't know just how much it had in common with the original classic. So with that being said, I'll just start off with what I didn't like. Most of all, that would have to be how much of an homage it is to Predator. Now don't get me wrong. An homage can be a beautiful thing when done in moderation, but they went a little far with it. This was clearly a film made by fans of Predator for fans of Predator. After a sequel and three spin-offs that left bad tastes in the fans' mouths, it was time for a reboot that was handled with care, but so many scenes are completely recreated to the point of some fans accused it of being a rip-off instead. I also had trouble adjusting to some of the CGI, mainly the fire when Fishburne's ship explodes, and other minor things. It took me a little while to get used to the dogs, but upon subsequent viewings, they've grown on me. I'll just say that they shouldn't have had the special effects done in-house at Troublemaker. But as it turns out, after inflation, this movie had a smaller budget than the first film, so you can expect them to cut some corners.

There was also some pretty uninspired dialogue. The script was just plain boring at times, and it was so cliche and predictable that it made me feel like I was watching a B movie with A movie production values. That could be considered a compliment to some, or an insult, depending on your tastes. I think it's a little bit of both. The actors must have known they didn't have much of a script to work with, because they were all one note. I probably shouldn't blame the actors, because they didn't write their own lines. They did the jobs that were expected of them with what they were given. Obviously the lead guy, Adrien Brody caught a lot of flak for being too skinny and not tough enough for his role. I say that's a bunch of b.s. He wasn't skinny. He beefed up for the role. Nevertheless, when you compare anyone to Arnold Schwarzenegger's big muscle-bound ass, who doesn't look skinny? I thought he was okay. He wasn't great by any means, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I said Schwarzenneger was a great ""actor"" in the original. Arnie kicked ass, most definitely. He was perfect in his role, but a great performance? Not really. But that's not what these movies are made for anyway. Brody may never have really showed me why he was chosen for the leading role, besides the fact that he won an Oscar, but I was still never disappointed in him. Danny Trejo and Laurence Fishburne are a couple of favorites of mine, but their screen time is so limited that you may not even remember they were in this movie unless you paid attention. That pissed me off a little bit, but I can live with it.

I felt like the pacing was a bit off as well. I actually enjoyed the first half of the film, which played out just like the original, except for these guys not knowing each other. The suspense is what was so great about Predator. Keeping the monster in the shadows until it was time for it to strike worked quite well in 87, so why not try to recapture that? I honestly feel like they did a good job. The very beginning is Brody's character, Royce, falling from the sky, which is a different way to start a film, so I commend their willingness to take a chance. They said that the original openning was Royce on a Black Ops mission or something, taking out some guys, then getting kidnapped by the Predators. I would have preferred that beginning, but like I said, they took a chance, and I respect that. The first half is so uneven when you add in the second half though. The first half is tense and exciting. You feel like you're actually lost in the jungle with them. The second half turns into a 'by-the-numbers' action flick. Nothing original will be found in the last half, or even the entire film, but it never gets bad. So don't get me wrong. This movie was so much like Predator, save for the alien dogs. The gatling gun was cool homage to Bill Duke's character Mac, who happens to be my third favorite character in the original, after Dutch and the Predator himself. It's definitely a B movie with an A movie's budget. As for the predators themselves? Yeah, they're still badass. In fact, they're even more badass because there are different species. Now for what I actually liked.

I liked the eerie and ominous feel of the film. The dark pallete and cinematography served the tone very well, and the music is just plain fun. I loved it. I thought the music was a great callback to Alan Silvestri's original score. The one comic relief character was such a caricature, but luckily his worst moments were left on the cutting room floor (according to the deleted scenes that are available in the extras). This film should also be given credit for using the same set over and over, but never getting redundant or old. I've done enough studying of films (not all in class) to recognize redressed sets, and this one is full of them. Even so, I thought it was beautiful. Beautifully dressed sets, beautifully shot locations, and even with some questionable CGI every now and again, beautiful creatures. I also liked that the film doesn't try too hard to over explain everything. Face it, there is not much to tell that we can't figure out on our own. We're following a group of lost criminals and killers, and a doctor, through an alien jungle, who are being tested by possibly, the galaxy's best hunters. This movie may not have been all that we were hoping for, but it's still decent entertainment. If you don't care about it before you see it, you probably won't be impressed when the credits roll. As for the quality of the disc, it's very good. Almost reference PQ and AQ, and it has some very good features that don't last long enough. So all in all, I recommend it to anyone who is already interested in it.

4036049,5,B002ZG98LO,"I didn't even know this movie was out until I saw a preview for Showtime...I asked myself how did I miss this one. I go to 10-20 movies a year and I totally missed any previews. This tells me that the advertising budget was pretty nil. It was only a couple weeks before it aired so I figured I'd wait instead of rent. So I kept catching it at different parts of the movie and getting more and more intrigued. Then I finally got to watch the whole thing and I was very very pleased with how good it was!

  Predators made more sense to me than all the other movies combined. 3 Predators on a game reserve honing their skills...instead of 1 Predator marooned on a planet with 6 billion people hoping to find some action. AvP brought up the concept of 3s but Predators expands on this giving them each a specific task. The Falconer-in charge of recon, The Trainer-in charge of stratagy testing weakness and strength and the berserker-The muscle of the group. A real fighting force. From my military background someone of Brody's stature makes more sense to me than Arnold....although Arnold, Ventura looks good on paper and film. It's just not reality. The people I knew in the seals and special forces were all average size..albeit in very good condition.

  The movie starts with Royce falling from the sky and from that moment on it's nothing but action....Just what I'd hope for from an action movie! There wasn't a lot of dialog between characters but that's just what I'd expect from a group that was thrown together unexpectedly. The movie really pays homage to the original but it should it's a sequel. Like in the original the Predator hung it's prey in a tree. Same here. Royce covering himself with mud...well it was already told to him that this is how Dutch survived....The best tactics are passed on by the survivors. They used pretty much the same soundtrac as Predator, so they could have come up with something different but it didn't spoil the movie for me, as a matter of fact I barely even noticed because of all the action. The movie even gives a nod to Alien and I haven't seen any other reviews about this but what and where did the ancient tunnel boring mechine come from??? Why was it abandon??? Don't really need those answers not what the movie was about. It's about survival!

  I think the casting was perfect! Brody pulled off a great action figure with Royce. The russian, The yakuza(sp) perfect! Fishburne was almost perfect as a schizophrenic survivor for 10 seasons...I say almost perfect because he is a little hefty for scavaging for so long....I would have laughted my a** off if he had called his friend Wilson! lol

  In reality this is a 4 star movie but I believe it to be the best of all the Pred movies and the job they did with a minimal budget looked great so I give it another star. I'm ready for a sequel!!!

  The blueray disc looked really good except the scene after the water fall was real grainy...the extra content was great. Gives some background on some of the characters before the abduction.

This is one of those movies where you could care less about the characters, and you just sit through it waiting for it to be over. Very disappointing movie and nothing like the original. In fact it's a shame that this movie has a similar title and is associated with the original Predator movie.",1338336000,,528,4.688172043010753
4036051,3,B002ZG98LO,"It seems a very long time ago when the word `Predator' in the title meant a decent film: a fusion of sci-fi and action with plenty of tension. I gave up on the series after the first (and dreadful) 'A vs P' movie. Despite that I was quite excited when I heard about this Rodriguez re-boot and thought I'd give it a go, especially with that S at the end. One always lives in hope of a new 'Aliens'.

This, however, is not it!

It begins intriguingly enough with a group of soldiers and ex-cons being dropped into a mysterious jungle... but after that it's all rather familiar. This film is very much a re-run of the 1987 original just with a different setting, a few underwhelming twists and some not-so-subtle references to other films ('Aliens', '7 Samurai' etc).

The action is OK, though there is a distinct lack of suspense, while everything else - camerawork, stunts, special effects etc - is efficiently workmanlike. The dialogue is functional but taken down by some puerile and sexist jokes to pander to the teenage boy audience. That's a shame because 'Predator' began as a movie for adults with its 18 certificate. On the subject on dialogue, Brody's voice is risible: from the Christian Bale/Batman school of gruff talk.

Spoilers in this par so if you haven't seen the film, skip on to the next. My biggest gripe was Laurence Fishburne. Now I think he's a fine actor but here he's just going through the loony-motions. He's utterly unconvincing. More than that, his physical appearance is ridiculous. He's supposed to have survived on the Predator-planet for ten years, scavenging what he can; at one point he even says there isn't enough food. And yet it's difficult to imagine a plumper, better fed man! He should really have been told to get into better shape or been fired the day he rolled on to set.

Overall 'Predators' is not a bad film (though it's definitely not a good one), it's just a pointless one. If it hadn't been made neither film history nor the franchise would have been any better/worse off. That seems a terrible waste of time, talent and money.",1338076800,,2078,4.651226158038147
4036052,3,B002ZG98LO,"""Predators"" is a film that, obviously, tries to be the ""Aliens"" of the franchise. This was originally, thought-up and written by Robert Rodriguez (who is executive producer), but his script was rewritten by a couple of screenwriters, and instead of Rodriguez directing, ""Armored""'s Nimrod Antal was chosen to direct. Thankfully, KNB (""Walking Dead"") took-over, as creature effects, instead of ADI (who had worked on the AvP films).

 In an attempt to be a ""direct"" sequel to the original film, a group of humans are mysteriously, kidnapped and then parachuted to a rainforest. However, we soon learn that this group is made-up of different types...murderers, assassins, mercs and soldiers, who soon find out that they're on another planet, within a game preserve.

Basically, it's The Dangerous Game. I actually, really like this idea, but unfortunately, the idea is not as executed well, as hoped.

Adrian Brody plays lead of the group, made-up of other actors, Walter Goggins, Alice Braga, Topher Grace and even, Danny Trejo, to name a few. Unfortunately, Trejo's character is barely developed and there's really nothing memorable of his role.
Topher Grace is certainly, an odd choice, but the reason of his selection by the Predators (while, pretty lame) isn't revealed, until much later in the film. Adrian Brody beefed-up for his role and he does an ok job with his performance, but he is no Arnold. There is a cameo by an actor, that I won't spoil, but they explain the reasons why the Predators are hunting them, as well as little backstory on the Predators.

The film does take a while to get going and uses the time to try to develop the characters and establish the situation. The action scenes are quick, but fun to watch. The three hunting Predators have fantastic designs and look menacing, but unfortunately, only one shows their face and its definitely, not the face we expect.

That being said, it needs to be pointed out that there are two different Predator species at war with each other. The three hunting Predators are one species, while the other species (the Predators we know, from the previous films) is represented by one warrior, who is also on this game preserve planet.

As I mentioned, the action scenes are brief, especially, with the two out of the three Predator hunters being quickly, killed off, one after the other, near the end of the film. I must mention though that I love the battle with the ""Falconer"" Predator and the Yakuza character. There's also a short sequence, near the beginning, of Predator ""dogs"" chasing the humans around, as well as a scene of a  bipedal, insect creature that chases Topher Grace, until it's shot.

You can see that there are clearly, both good and bad ideas in this film. There's a lot of homeages and mentions of the events of ""Predator"", but this film fails to stand on it's own as something, original and necessary for the franchise.

Predator blood-feuds is an interesting concept, that's been brought-up in the comics, but it just complicates things, instead of adding something new.

If Robert Rodriguez, Nimrod Antal and the writers, really just developed the characters better and came-up with more scenes of the Predators, this movie really couldve been great.

Hopefully, the sequel to ""Predators"" will do just that...",1337904000,,3299,4.945750452079566

The idea of the doctor character who is actually 'working for' The Predators was ASSININE!!! I think Robert Rodriguez was NOT the right Producer for this type of film. Stick to 'Desperado' and 'Machete' dude--that is your niche. I felt sorry for Danny Trejo (who I totally dig) in this film-as an ACTOR...his abilities were WASTED and he gets slaughtered much too soon. The Brody character should have went to him or the awesome Larry Fishburne. The female in this movie is just annoying. Also--the 'alien jungle' looked WAAAAAY too much like one from earth. Perhaps if a bit more imagination went into the trees and plants, it MAY have been a bit better--but that would have cost too much for this mid-budget rehash of the first Predator film. The thing that made Predator 2 so killer was that the Predator came to THE CITY. And Danny Glover was his usual great self. Also the ending when he enters the ship and you see the 'Alien' skull gave us all a thrill (even if the AVP films--especially the 2nd one--were dissapointing). My choice for director on the NEXT sequel (if there is one) is: Guillermo Del Toro! Remember what he did with 'Blade 2?' The BEST of that trilogy by far...",1332979200,,1508,4.588888888888889

Eventually it does and does a nice job with the CGI and the Predator hunter make up.  Unfortunately the movie offers nothing in the way of surprises and is nothing new.

Here's the deal.  Eight or nine bad-ass killers are kidnapped from Earth and dumped on a remote planet as game for the Preds.

The action this time takes place on an unknown alien planet that serves as a game preserve for the predatory Yautja race, who have kidnapped humanity's deadliest predators and dropped them on the planet to hunt for sport. Even though this movie may not have Arnold Schwarzenegger's star power like the original did, overall it is a step forward for the franchise in terms of direction quality, story and acting. Pretty much the whole cast for the movie deliver memorable performances, and I was especially surprised to see Adrian Brody convincingly portray a bad ass but intellectual mercenary.

This is not a sequel to Predator 2, and it seems to mostly ignore it from continuity. It's not a full reboot of the franchise either, since it is a sequel to the original film. Perhaps we need to coin a new term for it, but regardless I am glad this is the direction they went in for it.

4036063,4,B002ZG98LO,"No more merciless violation of the saga of the Predator; those days are finally over, and Robert Rodriguez made sure of it.  It took years for someone to take up the courage to do so but, alas, our remake has finally arrived.  You can almost hear the sigh of sweet relief from the franchise in its entirety as things seem to have come full circle after an era of mediocrity.

The gist of it is this:  It's a good film.  This marks a successful transition in its own right, its association with its past iterations notwithstanding.  That said, as a thriller, it's merely adequate, but you really couldn't ask for a better rejuvenation.  Admittedly, the warts that accompany it simply come with the burden of acquiring the franchise and pulling it out of its own muck that has accumulated and festered for over two decades.  With this in mind, Predators is an achievement, however you look at it, but it needs to be recognized as a stepping stone, first and foremost.

There is room for improvement now that the foundation has been set; Exec producer Rodriguez and director Antal know this better than anyone, and you'll inevitably see them throbbing at the mouth within the next year as they look to the future of the franchise, which is now in their hands.

Simultaneously adhering to its roots while abandoning any true reference to its sister franchise (Alien), Predators is a movie that revels in its salvation and freedom.  It is ironic that this is the case given the film's strict commitment to the themes, styles, and traits of the original, but this is more of a testament to how alienated (no pun) the ill-conceived sequels were from their parent.  Neither Rodriguez nor Antal were bound by tradition to play it so close to home - God knows that no one would blame them if they chose to situate themselves as far away from the franchise's past mistakes as possible - but if any entity in the universe that is cinema could benefit from a little bit of respect, it's this one.

The end result is a movie that is charmingly vintage, methodically paced, and curiously restrained.  Neither look to be necessarily beneficial nor detrimental to the future of the license; rather, they appear to be aesthetic decisions that, at best, give the movie its own identity and, at worst, feel untrue to the inherent nature that the Predator exudes.  It can be unsettling to those expecting something outrageous; that isn't the name of the game, here.

Rather, Predators excels when it revels in the quiet unraveling of the world around our competent, albeit vulnerable, protagonists.  Future entries would be wise to further explore the mythology behind these iconic creatures and their lifestyles - it's a gold mine for intrigue and franchise-defining moments that Rodriguez and Antal are more than capable of capitalizing on in future entries.

However, a mixed bag awaits those who would analyze the casting decisions.  That said, it's not a matter of talent, or lack, thereof.  Rather, this odd mishmash of Topher Grace, Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Danny Trejo, and Laurence Fishburne transcends suitability and falls smack dab into pure oddity.  For every mandatory Trejo and offbeat Brody (who warms to this role nicely, by the way) there is a Fishburne or a Grace that attracts nothing but the feel of an unnecessary inclusion.  It's much too crowded for a movie that relies on the oppressive nature of an alien planet upon a select few doomed individuals.  Fortunately, even for those whose roles feel uninspired, everyone works well enough with one another, and the right decisions leave one with enough confidence for the crew to get the rest right next time.

Predators isn't a reinvention of the license; it's smarter than that.  Rather, it is a very humble regression, one that separates the wheat from the chaff, and what emerges is a lean, unambiguous beast of an action film that isn't really scary enough, funny enough, or exhilarating enough to roll with the very, very best (and that includes the original).

With just the right amount of action and bravado, the film also benefits from a tight plot line and a great score by John Debney, who pays homage to the original's landmark score by including themes from Allen Silvestri's composition for the first film.

While not quite as good as the original, this is still a worthy follow-up, even if it took twenty years or so to come to life.

""Predators"" takes the place of ""Predator 2"" as a more likely and ""logical"" sequel to the original 1987 classic.",1320192000,,1173,4.8059701492537314
4036157,5,B002ZG98LO,"I may be leading the charge on this one but I think Predators has to be the best Predator movie that's ever been made. Dare I say, even better than the original in many ways.

Predators tells the story of a group of strangers who wake up in a remote location only to find themselves pawns in a deadly game devised by their mysterious captors: The Predators.  Soon, they realize that they're not on Earth but an alien planet which is being used as a game preserve. Will all of them survive and figure out a plan to make it home? Lol, well--you'll have to watch it and see.

One thing Predators does wrong, in my opinion, that the original gets right is the fact that-in this movie-you can pretty much figure out out who's going to bite the bullet next.  However, what it does get right is keeping up suspense and tension enough and then delivering a satisfying conclusion. Too many movies these days fall flat in that area.

I actually was more impressed with this movie than I was with the AvP movies. This one got back to the basics of why the Predators do what they do. Even though I liked the AvP movies, they were a little too(how shall I say) polished(and shallow, I'm afraid) for my tastes. Predators made it dirty again, more testosterone-fueled...and that's a good thing, especially for this franchise.

Without giving too much away, the ending leaves things pretty much open for a sequel. I would love to see one but not so long a time between films. Definitely bringing back Adrian Brody and Alice Braga.

Heck, it'd be nice to even see Arnold make a return to the series...at the very least, to put a good ending to the franchise. I can wish, can't I?",1319760000,,1662,4.447368421052632
4036158,4,B002ZG98LO,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film.  There is an unusual mix of characters, who find themselves falling onto a planet that has an unusual jungle and some frightening creatures.  They wonder what is going on, in particular when they figure out that all of them are killers in one way or another, with the apparent exception of a mild mannered doctor.  As they slowly get picked off, it dawns on them that they are not on Earth.  They must then choose whether or not to cooperate with each other, which none of them seem gifted at doing.  Once they meet a survivor (an overweight and perhaps insane Fishburne), they learn even more about the predators.  The survivors - for a sequel - do evolve as characters, which is also fun.

I liked the way that the Predator concept evolves in this one.  There is more than one species and they seem to be blood enemies.  They are also training themselves with the hunt of man and each other across predator species.  While they have the same macho enjoyment of blood fights, they also hunt in threes in this film.  While their vulnerabilities are greater in this film (an inconsistency), the human fighters are better actors even than the first one.  The story is also more coherent than the first, in my opinion.

Add PREDATORS to the bow-wows; I tuned in to this barker and--like watching the proverbial train go off the rails--I couldn't take my eyeballs away.  The entire premise evokes nothing but a yawn:  A group of thugs dumped on a planet to be hunted by the dreadlocked, halitosis predators (only, mind you, there are two different species of predators, egads!); in other words, unlikable characters that we don't care about meet violent endings.  Aren't we supposed to cheer?  Well, I did laugh, but I don't think this film is a comedy.

Adrien Brody needs a new agent, because he's doing a stellar job harpooning his career.  Here, playing some sort of disinterested mercenary--while whispering in his best ""tough guy"" rasp--he is a halibut out of the bay and about as believable as my attorney going to confession.  In other words, it doesn't work.  Laurence Fishburne makes a brief appearance in a cameo that can only be summarized thus:  Howler.  Alice Braga plays the only female role--in stereotypical fashion--and the predators roar and pounce and disappear and reappear and need a cosmetic surgeon and bleed buckets of green, culminating in an uber violent ending where Brody gets to play predator pinata.  It's silly, lame, nonsensical, whimsical, banal, trite, and boring, and those are its good points.  If PREDATORS is the new brand for this franchise, I'll take my green elsewhere.

The rest of the story is original, with plenty of plot twists that you don't necessarily see coming, unlike previous sequels.

I liked the rest of the cast too. You buy into the story line that these are complete strangers thrown into an alien world.

I think he's some special ops but I can't really tell as his growling is a little too much like a mutter to really make out his words.

Beyond that, this thing is full of people just walking through jungles with the ""spooky"" music playing. Sure the Predators come eventually but when they do, you're too bored out of your scowl (and annoyed with the academy for giving Adrien Brody an Oscar) to really care.",1304899200,4,924,4.5
4036327,4,B002ZG98LO,"After so many awful sequels, the Predator franchise finally gets a semi-worthy follow-up to the original Predator.  Now first off, Predators is nowhere near as awesome of a movie as the original Predator.  Not even close.  But it IS a bit better than Predator 2, and MUCH better than those awful Aliens Vs Predator movies.

What I liked about the movie was they didn't go all out with crappy computer generated special effects.  There are some that are used tastefully, but not boat-loads like so many modern action movies that come out these days.  The second thing I liked about it was how they just copied what worked from the first movie, and even used the same soundtrack.  Normally I would think copying another movie is pointless, but in this case it's just finally nice to see another Predator movie that is fun to watch and follows somewhat the feeling of the original movie.

I do have one major complaint about Predators.  The casting leaves a lot to be desired.  So many of the actors and their characters are just boring, and I can't help but think if the casting was better the movie would go from a good one to a great one.  There are some bright spots though, like Adrien Brody who really does a fantastic job here.  Also Louis Ozawa Changchien who plays Hanzo is a pretty cool character, but in my opinion not given enough screen time so he's wasted a bit.  You also have some decent acting by Laurence Fishburne, who's character has been stranded out in the jungle by himself for years, but he's so chubby it's hard to take his role seriously.  How is it possible his character is so fat?  Is he eating jungle donuts or something?  There's also unfortunately Topher Grace playing Edwin, and while normally I think he's annoying and would stay away from anything he's in, he's not too bad in this.

Overall it's FAR from the classic original Predator movie, but I did find myself enjoying this much more than I thought I would.  I would definitely recommend it to any fan of the original Predator movie, as long as you don't think it's going to be as good or better than the original movie.  Keep your expectations low, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1304726400,,2172,4.580310880829016
4036328,3,B002ZG98LO,"For all the fans of the Predator series this one may disappoint.  I liked the action, but this movie literally copies part one with Schwarzenegger.  First off the story is entirely in the forest as a rag tag group of various people (criminals, soldiers, and doctors) try to figure out what they're doing in some random forest together, and knowing most of the lines from part one, Adrian Brody copies lines and for some reason he copies a lot of what Schwarzengger does at the end of part one (you need to see part one if you haven't).  This is probably a script/director mess up so I don't fault Brody.

Another poor part of Predators is that it doesn't take the series anywhere.  So from a pure sci-fi action film, its good, but you won't get anything out of it as far as watching all three movies from the Predator series because it doesn't give us anything ""new"" (Not counting Aliens v. Predator series).",1304553600,,908,4.512195121951219
4036329,2,B002ZG98LO,"This was better than some other Predator flicks. However, some of the films it beats were not good enough to be called 'Predator' movies so beating them is not saying much. After you get over the initial disappointment of what this movie could have been, it can slowly grow on you. Just be warned. It takes about 4 or 5 viewings to purge the initial bummed out feeling.

There are things I liked. It had no lame characters aside from Danny Trejo's Mexican thug who, for some odd reason, seemed extremely lacking in badassness next to the other characters. He almost seemed wimpy. Fortunately, that weakness was made up for by others. I was surprised to find myself liking the sniper chick. Her role could have easily been ridiculous, but the actress somehow made it believable. Adrien Brody was fine as a skinny tough guy. Way too much has been written about how wrong it was to cast a thin person as the hero. In the real world however, some of the toughest men I've met have not been large people. I also liked much of the green jungle setting aside from the Predator camp that screamed SET! Some of the CGI was fun like the insane sky reveal and the giant drill. The hounds were okay but they really weren't all that scary. If you can kill one with a prison shiv then big deal. But, by far, probably the best thing about the flick (aside from the idea of the setting - which rocked and could have rocked so much more) was Laurence Fishburne as the grizzled Aircav survivor. I've become weary over the years hearing how awesome and brilliant Fishburne is. I've seen him do some decent stuff for sure, but never anything that blew me away. Well, in Predators, he did in fact blow me away! I was giddy with how good he was. Even the way he said little lines like, ""You talk... too loud."" was simply great. It was painful that his character was not on the screen longer.

Now for the junk I didn't like. The Predators still look like dudes in rubber suits. They come across as being too light for their size (like dudes wearing rubber suits). You don't get the impression they are massive, heavy creatures. I guess that was to be expected. No one has gotten that right since the first flick (if they did then) so why expect anyone to get it right now. It's a minor quibble next to the thing that annoyed me the most. Apart from the hounds and the running creature (and the face of one Predator if you can even count that)... there was not a single new monster presented on a planet where multitudes of deadly creatures have landed. Maybe they were all killed? Fine. What-ever. How about native life? Couldn't we have seen more of that (or Any of that)? Every jungle has its own crazy wildlife, some of it quite dangerous. Where was this jungle's indigenous life? I'll tell you where it was. It was safe in the studio's bank account... along with all the other interesting things we paid to see but did not see. That was my biggest gripe; the film reeked of cheapness. When I listened to the commentary Rodriguez repeatedly confirmed what a low budget they had. Well, guess what? It's not MY fault the studio decided to make a cheap movie but still charge me FULL price!! Roberto should have helped us viewers out by twisting some arms to put a few more things in. Sorry, but you failed us man. He was the producer. It is his job not only to watch costs, but to ask for a little more money here and there if the film needed to be fleshed out. I'll never pay full price to see a Roberto movie again until he stops being so cheap. A Predator movie is not a grind house movie. You don't go cheap on a Predator movie. But Roberto is not living on earth anymore. This has gone to his head. You can tell by the way he and the director incessantly pat each other on the back for doing such a wonderful job during the entire commentary track. By the way Roberto, shut up and let the director talk. You did not direct the movie. You talk more than a 13 year old girl. The director could barely get a word in.

After you get over the lack of cool stuff they could have done with the fantastic premise... you might finally be able to settle in and enjoy the flick for what it is; a fairly boring way to waste 90 minutes when you can't think of anything else to watch.

Then I watched it again, bought it on DVD and noticed the more I keep watching it, the more flaws I'm noticing. I mean, the first time I saw it I was just happy to see a new Predator movie, I've been a fan since the first came out and ever since I've been reading and collecting the comics and watching the movies and even made a couple fan edits for my own personal use of the AVP movies. Now with that said what was so disappointing with this movie and why does it get worse each time I watch it? Well because for 1 this movie tries so hard to be the original when it's not and second of all this is a sequel, but most the time it feels like a remake. I liked the cast, I liked the idea of a game preserve on an alien planet, but the planet hardly even looked alien. This movie is very unoriginal and honestly as much as Paul Anderson's theatrical release of AVP bugged me, it doesn't bug me as bad as this one. At least Anderson tried something original and being PG-13 or not, AVP brought more to the table than this movie. I'm sorry Rodriguez, but as a die hard Predator fan, your movie does not live up to the hype you tried to give it. Predator 2 is 100 times better and more original then this movie and as much as I want to like Predators, it just feels average!
Okay, enough of the bashing now, let me get to the good things.... The first fire fight at the Predators camp, the cast, the predator hounds all though I do feel they were used way to little, they could've been a great addition to the movie, but the attempt to introduce them kinda fell flat.. Okay more good things... The show down with the Death Row inmate, the sword fight and the Classic Predator vs Berserker Predator fight and the final showdown. Still all the good stuff fell flat because those scenes felt rushed... All the talk of Super Predators, there are no super predators in this movie, if you're a Predator fan and you want to see a Super Predator, watch AVP-R, fast forward all the teen drama, turn up the brightness, or do like me, make your own edit of the movie and watch Wolf in action, now he is a Super Predator. These predators are just as novice as the ones who got killed so quick in the Paul Anderson's AVP movie.. Sorry for offending anybody who might've liked it, but this here is just my opinion. 3/5 or 7/10 is how I rate this movie, just above average and that's me being nice because I'm a big predator fan...",1298937600,3,2511,4.1687242798353905

I love a movie that kicks off instantly with an action sequence.  Pow, you're in the thick of it, shut up and hang on!
Yes, I have to admit it, I'm a sucker for this franchise (even the 2 movies that shall not be named), so I'll forgive them most anything; it's been a long long time between movies.
Why do I like this series?  It's not complicated.  Hunt or be hunted.  Scream and run.  Stop, drop, and roll.  They have a good formula.  You know what to expect and you expect most of the cast to be fodder for the Predators.  It's not art.  Although the locale was beautifully filmed.  It's meant to be exciting.  I found it so.  And better still, it's a keeper for my collection!
I also have no complaints with Adrien Brody, supposedly slumming in a creature feature (he has to make a living and was obviously committed to the role): he's always an interesting actor to watch.  As for poor Topher Grace (why do I have the impulse to replace the first letters of his first and last name?), he was the standard red herring; it's mandatory that most movies have one.  He was neither good nor awful, I barely noticed him or the second guy that went missing (I'm embarrassed to say that it was quite awhile before I actually realized they were down a man).  There wasn't much time to establish personalities.  I even forgave them for lifting most of the plot from that oft remade classic: The Most Dangerous Game (1932).
I also must add that I loved the 'dogs'.

It looks, feels and sounds like the first but its not. The action and plot was great IMO but the only thing missing was a mad minute...I was dissapointed in Laurence Fishburn's roll in this movie.
(Stinkin psychotic weasle!)

This is a movie where I think Michelle Rodriguez would really shine. Adrien Brody reminds me of the last guy that got whacked by the tree truck trap in the first Predator movie. There are a few refences to the first movie and the finale was like a tribute.

I am trying not to spoil it by revealing any of the story. Please bear with my vagueness. The action left me wanting more and the ending seemed to promised it.",1297987200,2,717,4.296296296296297

4036459,4,B002ZG98LO,"First off, I got this at a steal of a deal from Amazon when the Black Friday sale was on. I purchased this for $9.99! That was the first great thing about this purchase.
Secondly, to see a film with the active participation of Robert Rodriguez is always a plus, no matter what!
Thirdly, to make a sequel without the mega-star who launched the franchise was a calculated risk, but truly worth it.
Anyway, the film starts, as everyone knows by now, with a freefall by Royce(Adrien Brody) to the planets' ground. He meets up with seven other ""specialists"", I use that word very loosely because two of them are killers! They begin to explore & have their fair share of run-ins with the planets' lifeforms! & their hosts or, in this case, their hunters! One by one they get picked off, they meet up with a survivor named Nolan played by Laurence Fishburne, who apparently has killed a few of these hunters in the ten seasons of being marooned on this planet! He has become psychotic & tries to kill the band of survivors & fails miserably in the process!
As with any ""Predator"" movie, survival is key & only the strong & resilient survive!
Just a bit of trivia or moments of paying homage are present in this sequel though, there is a man with a mini-gun, an obvious nod to Jesse Venturas' portrayal of Blaine from Predator, a man with a sword, in this case, makes his last stand, wins & dies opposed to Billy in Predator who lost altogether, the female lead survives, a trend for all of those lovely ladies in all the movies. The first movie has been referenced just like in the sequel, the Predator still amazes me as to how cleanly it can rip a skull & spinal column out of a body in tact! It's the third time that I'm seeing that & it still is frightening! & finally, I do not recall if anyone in this movie said, ""You're one ugly ......!"" I must have missed it or it was never used at all! Oh yes, one more bit ""Kill me I'm here!"" of course, a nod to Arnold's character from the original Predator.
Those of you who have enjoyed the previous two movies should get this one & add it to your library. It is a pity that the Alien vs Predator franchise was not up to par with this franchise! Great special features, highly recommended.",1297036800,3,2230,4.350119904076738
4036509,4,B002ZG98LO,"After the disappointing reception of Aliens VS Predator, I came to the conclusion that the Predator franchise is dead in the water due to a number of factors: The PG-13 rating. Since when was the Predator franchise PG-13? It doesn't make sense since the first movie was rated R and which is an action/sci-fi classic. Then came Predator 2, which I didn't like at first but after watching it for the first time several years ago, I really enjoyed it. The less said about AVP1 and 2, the better. Now, on to the review.

I have to say that Predators is hands down the best film in the franchise. Though it's not as iconic as the first film, Predators goes back to it's roots and delivers pulse-pounding suspense and action set against an mysterious alien planet with it's own dangers and fauna and flora. The story is well-written and gives life to the characters. The irony that is so clever is that the humans are actually predators themselves with their extensive background in military but there's a nice surprise at the end of the film that I won't spoil for anyone.

With it's subtle homages to the first film and getting back to basics while going in a new direction, Predators is a blast that ranks up there right next to it's predecessor; a somewhat new perspective that AVP1 and 2 tried to do but failed miserably. But now fans can rest assured that the franchise is hack and better than ever.",1296864000,,1399,4.5476190476190474

AVOID",1296345600,5,247,4.785714285714286
4036511,4,B002ZG98LO,"Updating the Predator saga is a cool idea, as the alien has proved to be an iconic and enduring figure in science fiction, since Arnold first battled the creature in the original Predator (1987).  With Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) as a producer, Nimrod Antal (Vacancy) as director, and a budget around 40 million, the prospects for success appeared good.  Although the presentation in Predators (2010) is undeniably slick, and features some exciting state of the art action sequences, the story that connects the events is not very well constructed.  While failing to reach its full potential, the film still has enough good points to thrill and entertain.

Predators begins boldly with a group of humans intended as Predator prey, plummeting down to an alien planet.  Royce (Adrien Brody), a mercenary, emerges as the leader.  The rest include soldiers Nikolai (Oleg Takrarov), Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), and Isabelle (Alice Braga), Yakuza member Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien), Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) an enforcer for a drug cartel, and Stans (Walton Groggins) a serial killer.  The oddball is Edwin (Topher Grace), who is a physician.  (Spoilers follow)

The film builds tension as the group reconnoiters the jungle, but the initial promise of the screenplay by Michael Finch and Alex Litvak, soon begins to fade, as the characters are a mixed bag ill-suited to working together as a fighting unit.  When under attack by the alien ""dogs"", the group panics, displaying an inability to target the creatures, and kill efficiently.  If this bunch can't handle the dogs, what chance do they have against their masters?

It's still everyone for themselves when the humans find the Predator's camp, complete with bloody trophies, and a prisoner Predator, chained to a tree.  Another man is lost when the Predators strike, as panicking again, the scattered group all wind up rolling over a cliff and tumbling into a pool of water.  Amazingly there are no broken necks, but the prospects for survival remains quite dim.

A ray of hope appears, when the group is surprised by Noland (Laurence Fishburne), a man who uses a captured Predator's suit to become invisible.  Noland plays a vital role in the film, because he provides crucial background information about what is happening, that ties events together.  Although the Predators supposedly use the hunts to refine their killing skills, it appears that they aren't terribly efficient.  An intelligent being with the ability to become invisible, would just sneak up and obliterate the enemy, not take a shot, then reveal itself and become a target, as they repeatedly do.  And wouldn't it be logical for the Predators to suspect that a huge empty ship might make an appealing hiding place for enemy prey?  The Predators are clearly not that bright, and the contest is perhaps closer to being even than it might first appear.

The same logic regarding invisibility also applies to Noland, as while invisible he could gather information from the group, or even kill them, if that was really his intention.  Instead he reveals himself, takes the group to his secret hideout, and then while complaining to an invisible friend about how there isn't enough food, tries to suffocate the group fanning smoke from a fire.  It's all quite absurd, and for more idiocy, Royce sets off an incendiary round to draw the Predators, with the hope that the aliens will free them.

His plan does work, thinning down the herd on both sides, and moving things closer to a showdown.  The film's big twist plays rather nicely, though it's a mystery why the Predators would consider collaborating with a human.  It finally comes down to the expected pairing of Royce and Isabelle, taking on the last remaining Predator.  Royce finally gets to flex his muscles, battling the Alien one on one, his body covered in mud, and even mimicking Arnold's original lines.  Teamwork prevails again, with an impressive coup de grace, and the story concludes with the door wide open for another sequel.

Well done technically, Predators is a fun film, but a flawed script prevents it from being really special.  The story has some good ideas, but also many problems.  It might have worked better if the team were competent fighters, instead of amateurs repeatedly getting their butts kicked.  The acting is very good, although characters like Stans, Nicolai, and Hanzo, aren't given a chance to contribute much, and are along mainly to become redshirt fodder.  It would have been nice to see more of Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo, whose talents seem woefully underutilized.  Cold, distant, and snooty, Adrien Brody is Rodriguez's model for the modern action hero.  Broady's rather full of himself, and kind of a hard guy to like.

Predators looks great on Blu-ray, not a lot of bright colors, but the sharpness of the jungle is very crisp.  There are some nice extra features, mostly related to production and special effects.  A commentary track featuring Rodriguez and Antal, has some good information, with Rodriguez often dominating the conversation.",1296345600,,5073,5.067469879518073
4036512,4,B002ZG98LO,"I did not know what to expect from this movie when I sat down to watch it.  I have seen all the Predator and Alien movies, and there have been some hits and misses for sure.  When I saw the previews before the movie came out, it looked interesting, but I never made it to the theatres, nor did I see any critics' reviews.  Now I can say that I was pleased with the movie.

  The movie starts off with Adrien Brody freefalling through the atmosphere, when his parachute opens, and he lands in a jungle.  I loved the opening of the movie, as right away it engages you.  Royce (American Black Ops) quickly meets Cuchillo (Mexican cartel played by Danny Trejo), who are both shot at by Nikolai, a Russian Special Ops guy.  Slowly, they encounter other ""mysterious"" persons in the jungle which include Hanzo (Yakuza), Mombasa (African mercenary), Isabelle (South American IDF played by Alice Braga), Stans ( FBI Most Wanted played by Walter Goggins), and Edwin ( a Doctor played by Topher Grace).  8 in all.  There was one more, but his chute did not open.  The group slowly makes its way through the jungle, slowly realizing that something is very wrong.  I will not get into too much plot, as that has been covered in other reviews, but the group does eventually meet up with another American named Noland ( played by Laurence Fishburne).  Noland has survived for a number of years, but is he on the survivors or Predators side?

  There are definitely similiarities between this movie and the first ""Predator"", but there are also some cool differences.  In Predator, you had Arnold leading a group of Special Ops, where Predators the group is a bunch of unsavory or criminal characters.  In this film, there are 2 new types of creatures introduced.  First there are the Predator ""dogs"" that do the Predators bidding.  Also, there is some other ""alien"" that is released from boxes that the Predators hunt.  The most interesting thing that is introduced in this movie is the 2 different types of Predators.  You have the original Predator from the first 2 Predator films, and then the new ""upgraded"" Predators of this film.  From the new Predators, there are 3 sub-types:  Berserker, Tracker, and the Falconer.  Eventually, we get to see who is the strongest... the Classic or the New?  I also enjoyed a reference made by Isabelle to the 1st Predator film, after the group encounters the Predators in the Predators camp.  She talks about how Arnold survived the ""first"" encounter with a Predator.  There is also a great scene with a 1v1 battle of Hanzo vs a Predator, in a homage to the 1st film again where the Native American waits on the fallen log to do battle 1v1.  Here though, we get to see this epic battle.

  There are some Special Features on this DVD which include:

* ""Commentary By Robert Rodriguez (Producer) and Nimrod Antal (Director)
* ""Decloaking The Invisible: Alien Terrain""  An interesting segment on the various background they used for the
  jungle scenes, and how they intercut jungle scenes from Texas and Hawaii to match up.
* ""Motion Comics""  Exclusive prequel scenes to the actual movie.
* ""Predators"" Theatrical Trailer
* ""Trailers"" for the movies Machete, A-Team, and Mirrors II

  I know there seems to be several differing opinions on this film in the reviews section.  Though I believe, if you enjoyed the 1st Predator film, you will definitely enjoy this one.  Yes, it is similar, but there are some cool differences also.  Enjoy !",1296172800,2,3462,4.717391304347826

Plenty of people die, the visual effects are lacking, and the whole thing seems like a waste of time.

4036531,4,B002ZG98LO,"The film is obvious at times and subtle at other times. For instance the protagonists do utter some evident truths like in ""you do what you have to do to remain alive"" or something to this effect. However, and this is why I give this film a higher than average mark, some of the behavior portrayed in the film do confirm this truthiness (thank you Colbert) incrementally. For example Noland (Lawrence Fishburne) remained alive so long how? By sheer luck? No, of course not, but because he took advantage of his fellow human beings, because in order to survive on this planet you have to kill (even your friends) and, who knows, even to resort to cannibalism. Yes Isabelle speaks the obvious when she says that humans and Predators are alike, but the beauty of the film is that they prove it.

Interesting idea - being ""kidnapped"" and transported to an alien planet hunting park. That was the theme of one of the original ""Outer Limits"" episodes too.

This film has everything that lovers of the Arnold movie had. It takes place in the jungle, the humans  have huge guns and the predators don't show up until well into the film.

You don't need a deep character-driven plot to keep this movie entertaining, however there is a nice twist at the end. Some will see it coming, but the action is what makes this film.

I'm not sure how I feel about the predators using dogs and a bird to help in their hunt but I understand the need to continue the mythos of these creatures.

Eight, well actually nine but one dies upon impact, people from different occupations with varying skills find themselves in an unknown jungle.  The last thing each person remembers is that they saw a bright light and when they awoke they found themselves falling from the sky.  These eight individuals band together, figuring their chances are greater if they remain as a group rather than alone.  They discover bizarre plants and are attacked by giant carnivorous creatures before discovering that they aren't anywhere near Kansas anymore.  With that knowledge, their goal becomes survival as they realize they are being hunted.  It's either be or be killed and when you're being hunted by a superior race with advanced technology, the odds aren't in your favor.

There's a lot of good stuff about PREDATORS.  It was a wise choice to take the franchise back to the jungle.  The jungle is still an untamed wilderness, so much so that we even refer to our cities as ""concrete jungles"".

Most of the acting in the movie is also solid.  Adrien Brody is the lead male protagonist as Royce.  Brody is known for his acting chops, but not for his physicality.  However, he really buffed up for this movie and he delivers a fine performance as an American mercenary.  Topher Grace is also good as a doctor who seems strangely mismatched among the military personnel and gangsters he finds himself.

Though there are some weak points, the overall plot is a huge improvement than the previous two ALIEN VS. PREDATOR films as well as being just as good, if not better than PREDATOR 2.  The film also references the original film as well as paying homage to it in a few sequences.

With that said, there are some major flaws to the movie.  Laurence Fishburne has a role that is basically a cameo.  He's in the movie for probably less than ten minutes and is heavily underused.  His character is an interesting one and there's a lot that could have been done with it, but instead he's merely there to serve as a plot device, a sort of deux de machina and comic relief all rolled into one.

The introduction of Fishburne's character, Nolan, is also where a major flaw in the film resides.  His introduction changes the entire pacing and mood of the movie.  What begins, and ultimately ends as a jungle survival movie, turns into an industrial horror rampage that doesn't end until the movie's final act.

Still, PREDATORS is a redemption that returns the Predators franchise to the B-glory of the original.  Here's hoping the sequels continue to improve upon this restoration of the Predator legacy.",1293753600,2,2774,4.8160676532769555

Supposedly the predators rounded up the most dangerous of Earth's warriors to hunt. However, someone forgot to teach the actors how to act like deadly warriors. Not for one second do you lose the sensation that you are just watching actors walking around holding guns. I mean if you are gonna give the actors lines like ""I work better alone"" it better comes across as genuine or as some sort of homage to classic action flicks. This movie achieves neither.

Robert Rodriguez is one of those directors whose movies tend to draw extreme reactions, one way or the other, from audiences, and mine was extremely negative. Reading all the four star and five star reviews here makes me think I saw another movie because it simply can't be possible that we watched the same tripe, predictable farce of a movie. I thought this was the worst movie I saw in 2010. The acting was uninspired. Adrien Brody may have put on pounds of muscles for the movie, but he could not convey the tough guy machismo and credibility that his role required.  Laurence Fishburne's cameo was ho hum and an utter waste of time. For an action movie, the action was surprisingly lukewarm.

I was afraid it would be too gory, but honestly it's not bad at all compared to Ninja Assassin which I just saw.  Ninja Assassin had an awesome storyline and superb actors, but the gore in that movie is pretty much unbearable.

Even the original with Arnold was a ""B"" film and the sequel with Danny Glover was definitely a ""B"" film.  The original Aliens vs Preadators was not bad and I would have rated it a ""B"" for a decent ""B"" film but I never watched the sequel and again I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this film.  There was a nice review in the Boston Globe that compared this film to Jean Paul Sartre's play, ""No Exit"" as well as the famous short story, ""Most Dangerous Game,"" and really that is what this movie is most like, the famous short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" a story in which a hunter is hunted on a deserted island by another hunter.  That's what this film is about in a nutshell:  Adrien Brody, the main character of this film, plays a former Delta Team, or Special Forces Member who has now become a mercenary.  He along with a few others have been captured and placed on a Predator hunting planet where he, and his companions are to be hunted to death.  All of the people selected along with Brody are hunters or killers, which makes this film like ""No Exit,"" an existential play by the French writer Jean Paul Sartre, who speculates that hell will be a self serve cafeteria, where people are placed in a place because of their behavior in which they turn in on each other, causing the main protagonist in that play to say, ""Hell is other people.""  Here the hell is partly other people, but mainly the hell is from the Preadators who plan no less than to kill all the people dropped in there, including Adrien Brody's character, and the question is, ""Does anyone survive?""  I will say 2 do, but who the 2 people are, I won't say.  If you like action, weapons, and the idea of killers defending themselves against more powerful killers, this is the movie for you.

4036719,3,B002ZG98LO,"I have a problem with this film. I keep thinking what it could have been rather than what it is. In the first one, you realize that the Predator was sent on Earth in order to hunt. You felt like it was some kind of a ritual of some sort. You didn't know much more but it was just right for that film. The goal was somewhere else. In this one, the true sequel in my opinion (although the idea of an ""urban"" jungle was also cool in the other ""Predator 2"" combined with the trapping of the Predator using their own camouflage weapons), in this one, it would have been nice to expand on the Predator's universe. A little more depth with the characters wouldn't have hurt either. The idea was good. The setting was promising. Some story devices were fun (I particularly enjoyed the fact that the Predators reunite different alien species and study their combat techniques in order to apply theme to their own techniques). But in the end, I would have liked to learn more about the Predators way of life. This wasn't even their planet. In a perfect trilogy (in my humble opinion), you would have the first movie with Arnold, then this one but with more emphasis on the Predators, their ways and their homes, and you'd have the final chapter in which the humans would infiltrate the world of the Predators, becoming themselves predators thus beating them at their own game. Like you may be stronger than us but we're smarter. Something like that. Just like Arnold in the original one. But with a bigger scope. Which is how a trilogy usually works (the overall arc being the same as the arc of the first chapter but bigger).

Contrary to many, I didn't really enjoy the arc of the character played by Topher Grace and I would have liked to see more of Lawrence Fishburne. His way of using some of the Predator's weapon and armor was awesome. But Man! That actor really is changing for the worse! He's getting fatter and fatter and the fat is changing the morphology of his face. I know that it is not a nice thing to say and I'm no Brad Pitt myself but darn it, I couldn't help but to think of one of the best line from Arnold whenever I saw the excellent black actor: ""What an ugly mo...""

Anyhow. ""Predators"" is far from being a disaster. It's a cool ride. I have it in my collection and I'm glad. I wouldn't think that you'd get annoyed by it. But to me, it certainly feels like a missed opportunity nonetheless. It could have been so much more!",1291939200,,2440,4.3841059602649
4036720,5,B002ZG98LO,"Im a long time fan of the Predator franchise but I have discovered a problem with nearly all of the sequels. All of the filmakers approach these movies as if you were new to the genre so they sort'a start from the beginning and take 30 or more minutes before you even see a cloaked predator alien.

For us long standing fans, we are ready to learn more about the galactic hunters. We want to understand their motivations, their desires, and we want to know more about their culture(s). We are ready to see the predators abilities really open up. For example they fight more like sumo wrestlers with swords and with fewer rules. We want to see more dynamic hand to hand battles.

To me, that ruined the movie (among other things). They took the original predator, the icon of badassery from my childhood, and had him b*** slapped around like a ragdoll. They took the most bad ass thing in the universe, and made it into a big p***y. Why would they throw a screwball at us with this random new race of predator? I just don't get it. No need for that, stick with the original. It wasn't broke don't try to fix it.

I am ecstatic to report that PREDATORS is not only NOT an embarrassment, it is a fantastic follow-up to the original, and better than PREDATOR 2! Adrien Brody (SPLICE, OXYGEN, THE JACKET, etc.) does an excellent job as the mercenary leader of a group of professional killers. His Arnold-redux is well played, w/ just enough grit and (low-key) humour. Alice Braga's character is basically a good cross between Michelle Rodriguez in RESIDENT EVIL 1 and Vasques from ALIENS. Topher Grace is surprisingly watchable, since I only remembered him from THAT 70s SHOW, and rolled my eyes and groaned when first reading of his appearance. Laurence Fishburne (THE MATRIX 1-3, EVENT HORIZON) makes a nice cameo, but could have been in it a bit longer. As for the PREDATORS themselves, they are just as intimidating, imposing, and lethal as ever! These are savage, stealthy hunters, without the wimpiness of AVP or the sloppiness of REQUIUM.

4036725,4,B002ZG98LO,"This film really picks up speed towards the end, which was nice. But I like an entire movie, not just the last half of one. Whereas Predator started immediately, and you understand from the getgo what is going on, in Predators, I seriously did not understand anything until I was half-way through the film.

[--> Spoilers:
Basically, you have a bunch of people who are dropped by parachute onto the Predator's home planet. All of these people were the really bad people back here on planet Earth, so they have a will to survive. After a walk that was a lot longer than it needed to be, and a monster fight that was way too long, they finally came to the edge of a cliff and realized they were not on Earth.

From this point, things picked up speed. We had a very interesting walk through the Predators camp, a breathtaking series of fights, and the final culmination of the film in an attempted murder, and a final scene in which more parachutes are seen dropping and Adrien Brody and Alice Braga walk off triumphantly. Spoilers End <--]

Overall, we had a good film overall, certainly an A-movie after the lousy AvP films. This, to a certain extent, lived up to the reputation of Schwarzenegger's early film. But it just didn't do it for me.

This film had some character development, but not as much as I'd been hoping for. I kept wondering why there was a woman in the group: was she going to fall in love with someone? She certainly was not the female-star like in the Resident Evil 1 film. Some of the characters seemed a little shallow.

I was motivated to go back and watch the first one again after finishing Predators.  If you like the predator mythology and typical action movies then you won't be disappointed.

The blu ray extras were also enjoyable.  The motion comics were brief, but gave an interesting glimpse to the characters that are thrown into the plot.  The Evolution of the Species pieces also provided more insight into the direction and depths that were taken to make the movie and mythos as interesting as possible.  The deleted scenes were sparse, but a few of them were great and Trejo fans would have really enjoyed seeing a few of his great lines make it into the final film.  Parts of the extras, especially the commentary, are a bit repetitive as Antal and Rodriguez take turns telling how awesome the other one is.

this time, i watched it with my wife who missed watching it when it was in theatres. she enjoyed it as much as i did.
although, this was my second viewing of this movie, it was just as good as i saw it the first time around.
the story is rather basic, but worked just fine for "" Predators "", as a group of killers from different parts of the world, find themselves throwm into a jungle, without knowing by whom and for what purpose, only that they are being hunted !!
Adrien brody stars here as our main hero, i must admit, when i first heard he was the lead actor in this movie, i was a bit disapointed, i was hoping for a bigger Arnold type of actor ( think Ven Deisel ), but i was wrong, and Brody proved me wrong, and that a good actor can fit any role, and Brody did a good job with his character in here, he looked tough and was up for facing the predators !
the rest of the actors were also good, Topher Grace was particularly good here.
most characters were intriguing and fun to watch.
action scenes were well excuted, a treat to watch, and seeing the predators coming to life in this movie and going back to what they like doing most, which is hunting people and killing them, was thrilling !!

The most despised of (which I still occasionally watch) being AVP Requiem. I waited a third of my life to see Aliens square off against Predators, and while the 1st AVP was acceptable (and only acceptable), the teen drama in AVP Requiem made me wish no one would survive the movie, including the writers. This solo Predator outing could have just as easily gone the same way. Thank God it did not. Yes, it copies some of the original, but the knowledge of the original was openly, in dialogue, mentioned in the movie and utilized as learned behavior by the characters, not just a carry-over by the writers. I would rate this one higher than Predator 2, but I still love the vibe and mystery of the original more. PS: the thing I disliked the most is the ""spikey dogs"" and the almost afterthought character of Lawrence Fishburn. 10 seasons on the run and his character only gives drawn-out explanations of what we already know then gets killed trying to screw everyone else over... unexpected yes, good use of the character no...

With both of the newer alien versus predator movies we got predators who were not the alpha stealth hunter I came to love in the first movie.  This movie tries to bring us back to the original formula with a jungle terrain,humans with big guns and predators who are stalking them.  Essentially the formula is right but something seems to be missing.

  First off the tension that the movie is trying create with the idea of always being hunted is non existent.  This may be due my second issue, all of the characters are mostly unrelateable stereotypes who seem like husks of people.  Tension can't really exist when the viewer doesn't care if any of the characters live or die.  And finally the build up to the climax of the movie is ultimately quite boring, because of issues one and two and that most of the action takes place in the last 20 to 30 minutes of the movie.  It seems like many of the fodder characters could have been killed at earlier points to keep up the pace, but live just to killed in the last half an hour.

Overall I feel the movie could have been much better given all of the elements but failed to deliver on what the original did.  I would have rated a 2.5 stars but the end action allows it to just make it to 3.",1291248000,,1304,4.213709677419355

The original was superbly directed by John McTiernan who directed Predator and Die Hard almost simultaneously and created movie magic with both movies. Arnold was smart enough not to return to the franchise for pathetic Danny Glover sequel why don't the producers and the studio stop making these sequels??
The move starts with Adrien falling from the sky. Bad premise to start the movie. The movie should have a slow beginning like the original Predator ship slowly arriving on earth. Adrien's tough guy voice and accent made me laugh out loud. Grace's role was more suited to him. The multi-national acting talent was a lame attempt. The woman in the original movie had a purpose as a POW. This female is just there to compensate for a female presence and same goes for the African American actor.
The ""dogs"" were so pathetic. The boar that tripped the wire in the original was more scary than these dogs!

I didn't even see Preadators in theaters, as I have not been as excited about the franchise latley. So, I was really, really suprised at how completely bada$$ this movie turned out to be. It paid a very distinct homage to the first film, but did so without feeling like it was just a re-hash of the same old stuff. This was indeed the sequel that the first movie deserved. I liked how the only previous Predator movie this referenced was the original, and it made no mention of any of the other movies. It didn't need to. The acting in this movie was top notch, as would be expected from Adrien Brody of The Pianist fame, but the supporting cast was all very well acted, and even sore thumb Topher Grace (he stuck out) turned out to be a very interesting character, that didn't detract from the action or story in any way.

The updates were neat in my book.  A great action flick with cool monsters.  I still think it's amazing that they did this with the same budget as the 1st one.

Edit:  After writing this is someone's comment section I felt it deserved to be part of my review:

Sometimes I wish Aliens started out more like this. One of my all time favorite movies but esp. after the 1st time you almost have to skip the 1st 45 minutes of ""boredome"" & start rewatching from then on. No need here. No real slow points. The beauty of Predators is that the whole movie is fun on multiple viewings from start to finish. At least that's my opinion.",1291075200,4,903,4.333333333333333
4036797,5,B002ZG98LO,"Ive waited for the ideal follow up to Arnolds Predator, and for the tremendous urban battle with Danny Glovers Predator. Since then, my favorite movie monster,has been crafted into a charismatic hero, hunting mostly Aliens and removing my love for the character as a movie monster to be feared. The excitement was gone. Predators starts off with Adrian Brody free falling through the sky, as does the rest of the cast one by one they land in this jungle, and thats just the beginning. Predators puts us back in the wild, where nature is king, and in the place the starnded heroes are in, nature comes in many deadly forms. Predator dogs, toxic plants, other humanoid aliens, and the Predators themselves.

There are alot of elements in this movie that will remind old fans of the best Predator movies, the first two. The Predator theme is fully back, which makes this a ""genuine"" Predator film to me! In regards to the AVP movies, okay movies but a waste as a Predator movie.

Now, onto the much appreciated recovery.

Laurence Fisbourne does an amazing acting job, my favorite since Morpheus in The Matrix. Topher Grace also adds a certain levity thats appreciated amongst all the tension. Until his characer reveals certain character flaws towards the end.

If you're looking for certain amount of savage Predator action, you won't be disappointed. The berserker Predator is the most fierce of ANY Predator, period. The Predator dogs are a brilliant design, and although they seem a little ""Avatar"" it isn't that much of an impact because they aren't a large part of the action.

The beginning and the ending of the movie are tied together wonderfully. I was really impressed with how they extablish the reason, and they how the heroes end up in the area they are in.

In short, if you liked Arnold, and Danny's Predator, you'll be satisfied. Not a 100% on the money film, but VERY good and worth it for a fan of the franchise.",1291075200,3,1929,4.726190476190476
4036798,5,B002ZG98LO,"Ha. Never been an Adrian Brody fan, but that could change. This is an outstanding movie on all counts. Creative, Intelligent, plot! Oh My Gosh...a real Plot out of a Hollywood movie. Dare we say it, could it be, Hollywood hired some actual writers who put their brains to work and created a movie with a...relatively...low body count filled with characters who had stories and which didn't seem like they were drawn from the cutnpaste theory of let's bang it out...!

Not only did I think this movie was great, but after watching The Expendables, you see just how great this movie truly is.

Sylvester Stallone reduced the action flick The Expendables to just another drop-in another round of artillery combined with a bunch of old guys who look ridiculous. Watching Sylvester Stallone make a run for the plane flown by Jason Statham was absolutely painful; Stallone ain't got it anymore and should stick behind the camera if it has to do with action. Jason Statham as always was just awesome, someone who looks truly tough and no nonesense. Ya wouldn't get any fall da rall political correctness from that guy.

We will be watching Predators for the sixth time this weekend, so much fun to watch a movie that was done right. Really. Couldn't we have more of these, puhlease!

Oh, also watched The Sands of Time. Same problem....endless action sequences that exhaust with noise and movement. If I wanted to play a video game I'd play a video game. And some men just aren't manly enough to play an action hero. I was worried about that with Adrian Brody. My mistake. Again, Predaotrs. Great movie! Most likely a classic...",1291075200,3,1621,4.758007117437723

4036800,3,B002ZG98LO,"As expected, this movie adds an interesting twist to the series of Predator movies by bringing a bunch of misfits to another planet to be hunted. The beginning is unique and interesting. The humans aren't admirable or likable in many ways, but being the target of others on safari still makes you root for the earthlings. And they all aren't totally unlikable. Just as the other Predator movies have some continuity of the Predators, the aliens are tough, brutal, and deadly. There are a few unexpected twists, but most of the movie is violent, filled with death, wondering who will go next, and watching for that next surprise. It is not deep, but it is entertaining if you like the genre. I give it a 3.5 as it is more than ok but less than a classic or really likable movie.",1291075200,,777,4.5177304964539005

Why didn't they have more Predators no longer hunting humans on the streets of earth, but a massive full scale war with the army and the twist being they now can take on our form and also they need our women to mate to carry on their race and plan to take over our planet, that would have been more exciting. I tried to enjoy this film but it was so tacky and cliche ridden I thought why the heck did they even bother.
What should have been an all out assault on our senses is just a let down making this the perfect example of just how much hollywood is short changing fans.
Let's hope this is the last Predator sequel, as it looks like leftovers from Outlander and Avatar.
Worth a watch if you must but it's no worthy addition, Predator 2 is still the best of the Predator sequels.",1290902400,5,867,4.105882352941176

Having said that, this movie was straight garbage. I think I've watched better movies on the SciFi channel. I mean jeebus f'n christmas, the whole movie is straight plot hole after plot hole. Nothing in it makes any sense: Hmm we're going to travel light years across the galaxy to handpick some dangerous prey and then throw them out over a forest with parachutes that don't necessarily open. I mean seriously, if I have to walk my ass to the supermarket to get eggs and one breaks I'm already pissed. These trained killers of course all speak English even though they're from different countries, one of them of course is packing a mini-gun, the planet which is not even in our solar system has identifiable plant life, and all this is just the first five minutes. The character development is non-existent, whenever anyone dies in the movie you couldn't care less. Lawrence Fishburne's character is nonsense: crazy guy who's smart enough to use the Predator's technology against them wants to start a fire to kill a bunch of people he just saved. Predators use infrared, I mean c'mon really?! for real real? I know 10 year olds that could write better stuff than this movie.

To sum it up, there's no beginning movie goes straight to the non-sensical middle and the ending blows. If you want to waste your money buying this film go ahead but don't say I didn't warn you.",1290556800,6,1634,4.45819397993311

4036850,1,B002ZG98LO,"If you are an action movie fan having greater than thirty or so years, director John McTiernan's ""Predator"" and Cameron's ""Aliens"" most likely comprise the binary stars within your solar system of much-loved sci-fi blockbuster films.  The brain acts as sponge for certain, (""Not a _______ scratch."") memorable quotes, the eyes continue to crave particular violent scenes, and the soul is sated with each repeated viewing.  It is not surprising, therefore, that any film which even hints at being within the same universe as ""Predator"" will guarantee the interest of many fans of the first film.  ""Predator 2,"" the 1990 Danny Glover vehicle, went off in some frankly bizarre directions, but yet maintained enough spunk and verve to continue to be regarded by most fans as canon.  The Alien skull cameo also tickled the imaginations of many fans for years, until the depredations of ""AvP"" and ""AvP-Requiem"" put an end to hope that a ""combination/versus"" movie could be done to anyone's satisfaction.

Now, the palette of colors from ""Predator"" is tossed onto another hopelessly warped canvas--the ""rebootquel,"" a sub-sub-genre of film surely spawned from the 8th ring of hell.  ""Predators"" is obviously a shameless reboot but claims--according to a certain DVD-mailer's website--to simultaneously be a direct sequel to ""Predator.""  Reboots/retreads/rewhatevers are nothing new, and have been going on since movie-making began--check out the number of ""Dracula,"" ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" and ""King Kong"" reboots should you doubt me.  Now, though, we have the ""gritty reboot,"" most likely to reflect how much greater is our, as an audience's, ""grit"" and moral ambiguity.  It, the gritty reboot, is also assumed to be a modern invention.  Please.  ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is pretty damn gritty, from a moral perspective, as is ""Moby Dick.""  There is little under the sun that is new with story-telling.

However, the makers of ""Predators"" can't even ""grittify"" this movie correctly.  Seriously, how it is possible to include Danny Trejo in a movie's line-up and completely screw up his signature type-cast, that of a sadistic, amoral, schizoid character who has a fondness for edged weaponry?  He honestly screams like a little girl during one part of the film, before being quickly done any with.  Perhaps the producers couldn't afford him for the whole gig?  Along the same lines, in which universe is it fathomable that the protagonist from ""The Pianist"" would be the character in ""Predators"" who is supposed to manifest Trejo's usual callings?  Adrien Brody plays the cold, calculating hunter, willing to sacrifice friends to draw forth the Predator?  No, just, no.

The characters are thrust into the movie via parachute, awakening (or not) just in time to pull the ripcord before landing on terra firma to make introductions with the rest of the cast.  Brody plays the mercenary antihero Royce who apparently dabbles a bit in witchcraft, being able to mark the Asian man in the party as Yakuza purely based on his calm demeanor, designer suit, and bare feet.  The party, a mix of soldiers, mercenaries, death-squaddies, criminals, and one doctor (played by a confused-looking Topher Grace) gradually come to discover that they are on an alien planet, and the setting is ""The More Dangerous (and More Hilarious) Game.""  There are some new bits of clothing that the screenwriters attempt to pin on the ""Predator"" franchise-mannequin:  ""Predator"" hunting-dogs, two warring factions, the planet being some sort of adaptive warfare training ground, and Laurence Fishburne, in a particularly short and embarrassing role which reeks of paycheck.  Morpheus would frown low indeed to see this descent.  One soon realizes, and pathetically quickly, that these ""new"" things are only poor camouflage attempting to conceal all that is direct copy.

There are quotes, scenes, personas, music, and portions of dialogue that are quite literally lifted--word-for-word, scene-for-scene, gesture-for-gesture--from the first movie.  One could forgive this as slavering hero-worship, if one didn't get the very, very distinct sense that the director is attempting to pull a fast one and claim originality.  The party quickly encounters the remains of a fire-fight fought previously, with evidence of firing ""in all directions.""  One member hefts a helicopter minigun as primary armament.  A character decides that his personal spirituality and honor demands personal, shirtless struggle with a Predator, blade to blade.  In a climactic final scene, Royce strips down to his trousers to reveal 143 pounds of robust, Predator-killing sinew, yelling ""I'm here, do it, kill me now,"" etc.  Isabelle, the one woman member is, of course, aware of the Predator's attack on Schwazenegger's team in Guatemala in 1987, and this mimics the role of Anna in the first film, another female character with singular knowledge of the alien.  Anything sound familiar?  It's all more sacrilege than homage.

Alright, then perhaps the movie could stand on its own, subtracting any mention of ""predator"" to avoid comparison?  The answer is no--the movie is laughable, witless, and comprehensively stupid to the core.  It's so bad it flips over being good and goes back to being bad again.  The movie turns a thousand loaves of bread into one, takes the ""mo"" out of mojito, and makes Lucifer reconsider who his third head should munch on down there in the Inferno.  Director Nimrod Antal even manages to make the atmospheric music, chord-for-chord identical to that in ""Predator,"" seem ill-timed and silly much more often than not.  To summarize, this is a film which so shudderingly aches of complete failure, that by comparison ""Predator"" becomes a work of Socratic genius, instead of ""just"" having been a very good, late-80's action flick.

They have a big predator and and a smaller predator in this one. But both predators are cool and toughest enemies to defeat in the jungle, especially with their cloaking device and laser guns. They are just plain awesome. The graphics are very well done. It really seems like the human team are really there fighting in their worst nightmare, the predators. The one thing that was weak, was who dropped the human team on this distant planet anyway and I saw no way they could get off in the end of the movie.

4036856,4,B002ZG98LO,"THE MOVIE

'Predator is/was one of my favorite 'background' movies - the quintessential 'guy' flick. I watch it when I feel like passively allowing the on-screen violence fill me up with thrills with no need for a lot of thinking or interpretation. It's not that complicated, really. All they want is 'to kill us' and 'we' (mostly Arnold) must kill them before they can follow us home and... kill more of us. Predator was near-perfect in that regard. A few 'political' background hints at the start to set the stage for the slaughter about to follow and then everything flowed smoothly: big men fighting and dying and in the end, as expected, the future governator showing the nasty alien that one of ours can best one of theirs if he puts his mind to it and tries really hard.

The sequels, up until 'Predators' were so-so. 'Predator 2', a serious shooter but way too many twists in the plot and... no thick, green, oppressive jungle and no past or future governors playing major parts. Not even one. 'Predator vs. Alien', a near-abomination. Boring, unneeded, probably bad for BOTH franchises.

So here comes 'Predators', an honest attempt to go back to the glorious Predator roots. A diverse number (not exactly a group) of convicted murderers, mercenaries and government special/lethal forces are literally dropped on a alien planet - the apparent favorite hunting resort for the species to which the original Predator belongs - and... the hunt is on. What else is there to say? Given the uncomplicated nature of the plot saying more would probably spoil the fun of actually watching the movie. Without revealing the plot, 'Predators' comes the closest to the original's purity and near-perfection. It's not quite 'there' - I'm pretty confident that there are no future governors or heads of state in the cast - but it's a honest, enthusiastic, worthy sequel that fans should watch and appreciate. I know that I did.

THE BLU-RAY EDITION

'Predators' gets one of the better Blu-ray treatments.

The better than decent picture is supported by a DTS-HD Master Audio sound track in English or 5.1 Dolby Digital alternates for Spanish, French and Portuguese. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese.

Special features
-----------------------
There are some interesting special features, most notably a series of well-done motion comics prequels that attempt to reveal the 'pre drop' whereabouts of some of the movie's characters.

Also notable, a commentary sound track with Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal discussing movie-related topics while the movie plays.

'Evolution of the species: Predators reborn' is a High Def, 40 minutes, basically the inevitable 'the making of' and featurette. If there was any doubt in my mind - and there wasn't - the principals eloquently convinced me that they were most respectful to the original Predator legacy and that they gave it all to making the best Predator sequel they could possible make. Includes chapters such as 'Bloodline', 'Decloaking the invisible: alien terrain', 'Intelligent design: the hunting camp', 'Predators as prey', 'Yautja transformed' and 'Rite of passage'. Worth watching. Really.

'The Chosen' is the other HD extra, really a 5-minute trailer that presents the main characters. It's okay but it's really a trailer and it should not be of much interest once the movie is watched.

In addition the extras include: 'Fox movie channel presents making of a scene' in low def and not as good as 'Evolution of the species'. Also, deleted and extended scenes, and another theatrical trailer.

Search
-----------
Predators lacks the in-movie trivia that other Blu-ray releases have but the search feature allows you to lookup specific scenes, your own bookmarks and, quite impressively, perform 'live lookups' via IMDB - the Internet movie database, providing information on characters, actors, crew and other film-related information. Well done.

Live content
----------------
If you are missing the half-hour pre-movie show you get at the theater, mostly trailers, this disc has it under its own menu option and it's brought to you live, via an Internet link so that you can get the latest trailer and other promotional material.

DIGITAL COPY

Can be run on a PC or a Mac (Windows Media or iTunes) and on any portable devices that support pocketBLU. If your portable device has a camera, you may be able to avoid entering the activation code and point the camera to the 2-dimensional bar code instead. Help on 'how to' transfer the digital copy to your favorite device is available through the movie's menu.

MY EVALUATION

The movie was a 3-star for me (vs. me rating the original Predator as a 5-star). The Blu-ray edition with its well done and original animated prequels and interesting 'making of' extra is a solid 4-star. The effort to making the digital copy a more user-friendly process is much appreciated.

Overall, a 4-star rating (I like it) is probably fair. Unlike the original 'Predator', this is not a movie I'll be watching over and over but I did have a good time watching it once and I may watch it again.

4036947,5,B002ZG98LO,"After reading dozens of reviews panning ""Predators"", I ended up waiting for the film to begin at home with a bit of trepidation. As soon as the pre-title sequence began, however, I knew this was going to be a fantastic film. From the pre-title getting-dropped-into-the-jungle sequence to the very last line (and the credits song, Little Richard's ""Long Tall Sally""), this film made my confidence in critics drop forever.

Explaining the plot would give quite a bit away - those you think will die don't, those you believe will survive don't, and the little twist toward the end threw me off because of what I perceived as lack of foreshadowing (but then, watching the film a second time, I saw that the foreshadowing was subtle and well-done, if you're paying attention). The film as a whole isn't a hack-and-slash with unecessary gore, and even the language didn't feel out of place. The one true scream of terror in the entire film is entirely justified in-context. The plot is intelligent. The cinematography is beautiful and truly gives a feeling of being on an empty world - a Predator game preserve - many light-years from Earth.

Though nothing quite compares to the original film that this is a sequel to, ""Predators"" still gives a worthy performance than occasionally challenges the original film's standing. From the familiar yet not-overdone score (so many memories) to the exotic vistas and colorful chemistry of the characters, none of whom are either boring or unecessary, ""Predators"" is a near-flawless sequel and certainly one of the must-sees of 2010.",1289692800,2,1568,5.003831417624521

The lead, I mean the guy is not action flick leading man material - sorry. Nothing in the movie makes much sense from one scene to another. The most ridiculous thing is how they arrive on this planet, they parachute in, but there is no reason to use a parachute if you can be transported hundreds of light years, I'm sorry but it is just really stupid. Phrases such as ""Why did they do that"", What's that supposed to mean"", and ""That makes no sense"" will come from you and whoever is watching it with you. Anyone who says this movie is good in the reviews must have an agenda, as in they stand to gain something by a positive review. In the end they left the door open for a sequel, they should have closed it. I rented it because I had a feeling it was going to be bad as are most new Sci-Fi movies. Don't look for the original ""Predator"" in this movie, he left and went home, don't look for ""The day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""Forbidden Planet"" in this movie, this director couldn't direct a taxicab around the block and the writers should go back to their cashiers job at McD's",1289347200,11,1210,4.265217391304348
4036950,4,B002ZG98LO,"First things first - let's face it, the sequels to the original (and riveting) Predator with AH-nold have been massively disappointing, and made the 'predator franchise' concept something of an artistic bad joke.  Not anymore - this one might the very best of the group, even compared with the original.  OK, some of the violence is a bit gruesome at times, but overall, they did a good job of making things exciting without making you feel like you wanted to puke and run out of the theater.  Fantastic acting and ending.  Even people who are not sci-fi fans might enjoy this one.  Blu-ray is the only way to watch however.",1289260800,3,624,4.636363636363637

After two stints of Predators fighting Aliens & a forgettable sequel of a downtown, Los Angeles-hunting Predator, the new ""Predators"" goes back to the cinema-style roots of the original, Predator film with Arnold Schwarzenneger. No Sigourney Weaver era acid-blooded Aliens to fight, spaceships or futuristic cities. Just a small war between Predators and un-suspecting humans who are literally ""dropped off"" on a mysterious planet with a dense, jungle forest reminiscent of the first Predator film. The odd-collection of individuals appear to be dangerous, but skilled killers from different parts of earth who seemed destined to die anyways had they remained on earth. The odd band includes a Russian soldier (carrying the Jessie Ventura rotating, chain gun), a South American Cartel (played by Danny Trejo of ""Machete""), an African warlord, a death-row inmate (armed only with a knife), an un-armed doctor, a quiet Japanese Yakuza (who makes good use of a samurai sword that he finds later in the film), a mercenary who prefers to work alone (played by Adrien Brody) and Isabelle who we learn is the lone, woman survivor of the Predator encounter in Guatemala during the first Predator film. The odd-band of individuals also encounter a lone survivor (Laurence Fishburne) who we find out survived several Predator hunting seasons on the planet when it seems most others have perished.

Overall, I enjoyed Predators, but I just didn't gain any new insights on the Predators as I hoped I would. The only new thing I learned is that there are two different kinds of Predators (""smaller & bigger ones"" as Laurence Fishburne explained) that are feuding against each other.  The planet in the film is just a mysterious planet and we do not even know if it is the Predator, home world. The film is just an experience of ""cat & mouse, hide & kill"" action sequences between the Predators and humans in a jungle pretty much like the first film in which both humans and Predators get picked off one by one. Adrien Brody is a fine actor in other films, but he really seems like an odd choice for this film as a more popular action star such as Vin Diesel, Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson or a Jason Statham type of actor would have better fitted the bill. I recommend ""Predators"" as I enjoyed it mildly but I think the desired results could have been a little better.",1289174400,2,2506,5.137254901960785
4036953,4,B002ZG98LO,"After watching Predators on Blu-Ray, and being an avid fan of the series I will say that I enjoyed it. Why? The story was borrowed a little from the first one with Arnie (Dutch) Schwarznegger. The acting was so-so, the CGI was cool, and it was a nice throwback to the original with a slight twist. Jungle violence, flayed corpses strewn about, and cloaked predators skewering and blasting the herd of humans caught in the fray. Gimmee popcorn sounds delicious!

Eye candy was fun, and the addition of the predator hunting dogs was a nice addition (release the hounds!). When you watch these movies you know there are no Oscars headed their way, you know it is styled for a select audience who enjoys sci-fi and if you go in with any other expectations besides people getting vaporized and shish-ka-bobbed with an occassional face to face toe to toe fight with a predator (a la Yakuza swordsman) then you will set yourself up for disappointment. This moive is fun ride - thats it, acting is mediocre, but still entertaining even with Oscar winner Brody at the lead.

Just have fun with it, don't expect to be wow'd or amazed like Avatar, and you may find that it wasn't all that bad after all. Overall the movie is like being in a single's bar - if you wanna have sex, lower your standards and ""go ugly early"" you may just get what you want out of it.",1289174400,,1350,4.483739837398374

Give me a break, if I wanted to watch Aliens again, for probably the 75th time, I would.  When the predator ship was about to take off from the forest the camera shots and lighting reminded me of E.T..  Come on!  I can't say the movie wasn't entertaining because it was. Fishburne gave an outstanding performance, and he always does, he is a great actor.  That crappy drawing of the surrounding planets, repeating the ""F word"" every other sentence, the casting was off, and what really gets me is how the doctor knew the name and particulars of a plant on an alien planet, doesn't make any sense, the plot is full of holes.

That said, this is not the original. There are key differences in the storylines. Here are a few of the differences:

1. There are some experienced jungle fighters in this group that have never seen this jungle.
2. They are not a crack merc team that have worked together for years that have maps and a common mission.
3. They are not in search of another military unit gone missing.
4. They were not dropped in the jungle by the US government under false pretenses, in fact they have no idea how they got where they are and who dropped them.
5. The thrown together group is made of people that have never met before ranging from experienced merc to off the street serial killer.
6. They were dropped separately along with other alien species.
7. There are traps set by the new group, by others in previous drops, and the Predators as well.
8. There are more Predators and they aren't all the same type.

4036991,5,B002ZG98LO,"I'm not exactly sure why I see so many negative reviews for such a fantastic, revisioned, update to my favorite sci-fi series. Predators is what every sequel should hope to be. It takes the core of what was great about its predesesors and adds enough new myth to the series to keep you coming back.
The biggest hang up for people since the first Predator was no Arnold. I'm sorry but that is a seriously foolish way to base the principle of a good vs bad movie. Honestly Swarzenager is a terrible actor who just happened to appeal to the testosterone junkies of the 80's and early 90's. Adrian Brody offered a fresh and stellar performance to the series and I was more than impressed with the over all cast as we got variants of different humans. They weren't all military or police. They were killers from the worlds dark underbelly which gave them a more realistic and fresh feel. In fact you begin to see their humanity under the layers of their criminal exterior's come out as the situation dictates them to work with one another. This helps you care as they start to fall to the Predators.
Another hang up is the world in which are protaganists are placed. It is explained by Fishbourne's character that the world is terriformed from Earth's vegetation for mainly hunting humans. So this is not a plot hole as some would say it just isn't explained until later in the movie.
The Predators are not week in this movie at all. Just like in all the other movies becasue of the strict rules of ""fair"" hunting the Predators adhere to, they get killed like they did in all the previous movies. I mean come on, in the first Predator Arnold was as good as dead but the Predator decided to give him a chance when he easily could have decapitated him on the log. The same holds true here. In the desire for the perfect hunt the Predators are willing to bet their lives in fair combat. Because let's face it, how cool, really, would the move be if they just netted and plasma cannoned everyone in the movie?
What you will find here in this movie is a continuation from the tried and true form of the original two Predators with enough new and interesting mythos to leave you on the edge of your seat. If you are hung up on Adrian Brody as the lead then by all means miss out on a fantastic movie becasue you miss Arnie so much. But if you have an open mind and love the franchise of the Predator then you owe it to your self to own and enjoy and excellent piece of sci-fi excellence.",1288569600,2,2476,4.361471861471862
4036992,4,B002ZG98LO,"I watched this movie with some reservations, but after viewing, I believe it is, on many levels, the BEST of the franchise (however much or little that may be saying).  Several things stood out to me:

1.  The movie is very well-cast. Brody strikes me as having a similar screen presence to Lance Henriksen, and Topher Grace is perfect as a ""wild card"" (though not much of a surprise).
2.  There is an ""economy"" to the story set-up, with a limited number of predators involved.  This is the opposite of what the trailers suggested, and to my thinking far more effective.  Having a lot of them would simply take away the need for stealth and cunning characteristic of the creature.
3.  Even heavily criticized scenes are set up and paced well:  Laurence Fishburne's scenes, while somewhat disrupting the story, are effective in themselves, and can be appreciated as a possible ""preview"" of the fate of humans trapped in the predators' preserve.
4.  The film develops a theme of moral choices in extreme situations, and how decisions reflect or shape a person. The diverse fates of the characters present a possible cycle of victimhood and villainhood, similar to (and inventively building on) the original story ""The Most Dangerous Game"".

4036993,4,B002ZG98LO,"I always liked the original Predator film, but I felt the sequel Predator 2 while an interesting idea, was too heavy on comic overtones and the film suffered severely for it. Predators returns to a more serious tone and almost seems more like a remake than a sequel. Other than some advances in the FX department and the jungle being on another planet it is essentially the same film. The good news is that is is every bit as good as the first film with a solid acting cast and quick paced action! The story is easy to follow and they waste zero time getting to the fun. Adrien Brody is no Arnold, but he makes his role as believable as possible.

I could not find much wrong with this film as action films go, but it does seem like we've been here before. If you like fast paced action and looking at some of the coolest monsters ever created, Predators is a sure fire sci-fi blast and a fun Halloween flick!

4036994,1,B002ZG98LO,"I have not been compelled to write a review for a film in quite some time.  Let me summarize the target-demographic audience who would enjoy this...residents of the morgue, anybody who bought the farm, the comatose, and possibly those in dire need of money so they volunteer for experimental drug-testing with the government.  In short--the brain dead!!

First a couple things about myself, so you can determine whether or not you will identify with my tastes.

I'ma guy, I love guy movies (No Country For Old men, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Jackie Chan movies, Transformers, last Hulk, Blade series, etc.).  I eagerly await films like the new Tron, Thor, etc.  I'MA GUY, I like good action with credible characters...

With that said!!

I really, REALLY, REALLY disagree with the cast of characters.  I feel like these actors are forced on you and there is little to no credibility for their ""hardcore"" edge.  Adrian Brody??  SERIOUSLY?!  This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's successor?!  Arnold was a classic hero in the original plot, he had credibility as a tough guy.  The guy from The Pianist however???  NOT SO MUCH!!  Casting Topher Grace, he was slightly out of place but he filled his role, the other losers in this film didn't add the slightest bit of credibility that they should have lended to their on-screen personas.  Everything about this film is so artificial.

The predators, which I am a huge fan of in the movie universe, have little on-screen time.  We're talkin' maybe 15-20 minutes of the film, which is pretty sad 'cause the film is 109 minutes running.  The predators seem to get weaker and weaker in the film industry.  When they debuted back in 1989 in the original film, AN ELITE SPECIAL FORCES TEAM had their hands FULL!!!  They nearly all bought the farm against ONE SINGLE PREDATOR!!

Then the sequel, a jelly-donut grazer was able to stop predator, AVP, a freaking scientist...seriously, just an ordinary female scientist!!  The predator, if you branch out into more than just the films, but in video games, comics, etc., is supposed to be one of the most formidable forces in the known universe.  These films do nothing to lend to that credibility or even honor the idea of the Predator race.  This film follows suit and makes the Predators appear weaker than ever!  The casting is horrible, the plot cheesier, I liked the second AVP more than this and that's a statement 'cause that plotline was crap!

You would expect a lot of special effects and wow did they blow it here too, one of the staples of the Predator arsenal--the shoulder-mounted laser cannon--hahahaha, they shot one of the characters with no body armor and there was barely a first-degree burn, I seriously think the Predator could have just cloaked, walked up to the guy and gave him an ""Indian"" rug burn with more consequence than his laser cannon.  The production team for this film really did a grave injustice to everything that characterizes what a Predator should be.  The cloaking special effects are cheesier, the ""team"" against the predators have a very, VERY weak arsenal.  We're talking about MP-5ks, pistols, an automatic shotgun, and one mini-gun.  The premise of how the film introduces the characters as well???  Laughable...they try to dress it up in mystery but it's just cheesy.

Please save your money or rent.

I'm having a hard time trying to be unbiased but that's just how bad this film is.  I have a lot of tolerance for the original AVP 'cause at least it was cool and had some worthy action scenes, albeit a lame culmination for the plot.  But this is worse than the last AVP, in my opinion.  So you do the mathematics, if you've seen it...ask yourself if you want to waste your time.

Whoever is endorsing this really has no taste in quality, and while that's subjective, I strongly urge you to consider the merits of being a 40-year old soccer mom and knowing anything about warfare.  The plot had some neat ideas but was poorly executed.  Please avoid purchase at all costs!!",1288396800,9,4013,4.791545189504373
4036995,3,B002ZG98LO,"The entire series has always been a little weak on backstory, although the first made a stab at it. Here, the gaps overwhelm the film.  A specialist group has been chosen from Earth as prey. Chosen by whom? The predators would have to be intimately immersed in earth culture to put together this group; and they're not.  Do they have a human agent who does their selection?  No explanation is even hinted at.

Brody, while a competent actor, is a stupendously bad choice as the protagonist; he's way too cerebral and articulate. Imagine Spock in the role played by Arnold in the first film. This poor casting choice is completely eclipsed by the choice of Topher Grace as the major bad guy; his denouement is utterly clumsy and lacks any credibility. This poor schlemiel is simply incapable of playing the heavy. Larry Fishburne is also miscast, poorly directed, or needs to retire before he further embarrasses himself.

Finally, the means by which the predators are overcome (temporarily) is stilted and counter-intuitive; it just doesn't make any sense that the remaining chief bullgoose predator can be undone by an unarmed, beaten Brody and a ""paralyzed"" chick.

This film works only as a sendup of the previous episodes in the series.  Unfortunately, no one seems to have informed the actors that it needed to be played tongue-in-cheek.

Point for point it follows the original Predator (Schwarzenegger) very closely, almost too close for comfort. Elements from Predator 2 (Glover) were peppered in as well giving this one a been-there-done-that feel.

Ever since Predator 2, fans have been clamoring for a 3rd installment, but have not found their fix. With the release of AVP and AVP2, Predator fans have been left out in the wind, with two horrible attempts. This all changed with Predators. The movie pulls no punches and wastes no time. A group of soldiers from different backgrounds (Mercenary, Israeli Sniper, Yakuza, Russian Spetnaz, Mexican Mafia, African Warlord, Death Row Inmate, and a weakling Doctor) all free fall into a strange planet, non of which can remember how they got there, or why they are there. These become meek points as they find themselves trapped on an Alien planet. Once this point is realized, they ban together to get the hell out of there. This of course becomes a moot point as they are meticulously hunted by a new breed of Predator. That's right, a new Predator. The new Predator, of a different tribe then the one we have come to know, not only hunts humans, but other aliens, and even our familiar predators as well.

Talentless, boring and borderline stupid, Nimrod Antal and Robert Rodriguez deliver a disappointing movie. There's not a shred of originality in this frantic sci-fi sequel.

Oh and that shot in the trailer of multiple laser sights trained on Brody is a cheat! Starts out with a bang but ends up with a thud...",1287964800,14,413,4.9855072463768115
4037054,3,B002ZG98LO,"Eight toughs of different nationalities (including one woman) are dropped from the sky into a strange jungle.  They quickly discover that apart from the fact that none of them have any idea where they are they also have a few other things in common.  They are all being hunted, by a seemingly unstoppable menace.  Plus, they are no longer on Earth.

Each of them is ruthless, each a hunter - except for an apparently hapless and helpless doctor who just seems out of place.  The toughest and smartest of them all is the guy played by a muscled up Adrian Brody, who thinks like the predators because he is one: a special-ops assassin who's gone off the grid and loves what he does.  The film makes a big deal of the analogy between the men and the alien predators who've abducted them and placed them in what amounts to a massive hunting ground.

It's what you expect.  Kind of scary, a bit kookie, but intense.  The acting is fine, and the cleverest bit is a cameo by a seriously messed up Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  The planet doesn't feel entirely real: apart from the jungle, that looks just like an Earth jungle, and the CGI sky, there are about 3 settings that all feel like sets.  As a whole, too, the movie doesn't quite make much sense - of course it doesn't really need to since it's supposed to be an escapist thriller about alien killers - but ... if they are the ultimate killing machines they are supposed to be, how come they aren't all that smart when it comes to strategy?  The thing about the predators is that they are a perfect combination of utterly primitive and technologically advanced.  They are a brutal race, who like to display the dismembered corpses of their victims as trophies, but at the same time have managed to create amazing technology.  Still, this is not bad as a reboot of the series, and the idea of strange beasts from all over the cosmos being adducted as prey and brought to their jungle is pretty intriguing.  It's nearly enough to take you back to the original intrigue of the concept and erase the memories of the downright wasted celluloid of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator-2/dp/B001VFM0YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator 2</a>, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Versus-Predator/dp/B0015OLMH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Versus Predator</a>&nbsp;series (all of which this film works to ignore - wisely making reference only to the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/film/dp/B00005221L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">film</a>).

This is basically an action film that stands on it's own. Nothing original happens. Basciacally a retread of all the spills and thrills of the original. That's not to say it's a bad film. I enjoyed it. It was cool to see ex-UFC champ in the movie and there were some unexpected twists. If you like action give this a try and is fun.

This movie Predators is just about as great as the first Predator movie with Schwarzenegger!  Definitely looking forward to the next installation in the series!",1287964800,,311,5.2
4037097,4,B002ZG98LO,"PREDATORS takes us back to what made the first film so damn good. One good move is in ensuring that there weren't sexy sullen teens mucking about, and this works to right away remove that teen slasher stench that piggybacked the franchise with the second AVP film. A suspenseful atmosphere is evoked from jump, as the opening scene features a man waking up in freefall. The parachute activates, and the stranger lands on a foreboding steamy jungle, and he's soon joined by other deadly-looking humans, all heavily armed. A sweeping glance informs that this isn't a band of saints and samaritans. Our eyes take in the San Quentin inmate, the death-squad goon from Sierra Leone, the IDF sniper, the heartless mercenary, the Latin Mafia thug, the Spetsnaz operative, the Yakuza gangster, and, er, a physician. Later on, Laurence Fishburne surfaces, and his crackpot character is also pretty unsavory.

This group of nasties soon learn that they're been abducted to a hostile alien planet (the non-moving sun is a strong giveaway). It dawns on them that this alien planet is, in fact, a hunting preserve. And that they are the prey. So it doesn't take long before that bump of self-preservation kicks in and our characters are jockeying for position.

The suspense is terrific. These cold-blooded killers on the run leave you perplexed as to who to cheer for, excepting Alice Braga's Isabelle. She seems to be the only straight shooter in this shady bunch. On the other hand, Topher Grace's doctor character seems so out of place I wasn't sure what to think of him. To segue now, PREDATORS resolves the different looks that these chittering, crab-faced alien hunters have espoused down the years. It turns out there are different classes of Predators, and that some look down on others. This becomes a crucial plot point.

Folks may bemoan the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jesse Ventura or Carl Weathers. Topher Grace is certainly no Schwarzenegger, and neither is Adrien Brody. Heck, the notion of Adrien Brody as an action hero boggles the brain. But then you sit thru this film, and it's a bit of an eye-opener. Brody as the prohibitive lead character seems a casting choice that's just off the beaten path. And yet Brody manages to go from tickling the ivories in THE PIANIST to bulking up and being badasss and adopting a growly Batman-type voice. He pulls it off. Alice Braga, the Brazilian bombshell, isn't quite the action heroine that Ripley or Sarah Connor were, but she injects depth to her character, and she is, I reiterate, a Brazilian bombshell. And, from out of left field, Louis Ozawa Changchien becomes an unlikely gent to root for. Changchien doesn't get a lot of lines but, as the Yakuza killer Hanzo, he exudes great presence. From the moment he's introduced, in his dapper suit, he was an instant favorite, and the film treats him with courtesy.

I love the hell out of the 1987 Schwarzenegger film, and I promptly recognized the musical score that heralded Hanzo's showdown with the Predator. It's the same score - but now with Oriental flourishes - that played back in '87 while Billy (remember him?) calmly stood there at the bridge, awaiting his death. Throughout its narrative, this sequel made subtle use of the original score from the original PREDATOR.

Danny Trejo is here also and in IMDb his character is listed as ""Cuchillo,"" and this makes me smile.

PREDATORS vastly improves on your generic sci-fi thriller. It is intense and moody, and action-packed and well-acted. For the most part, the pace moves briskly, and the fun as always lies in trying to pick out which of the cast are the victims and survivors. This is a welcome follow-up; it doesn't at all embarrass the franchise. Maybe one nitpick is that the kills aren't so innovative or jaw-dropping, although I did enjoy that moment of no-nonsense spine removal. I get the definite sense that we as a movie-going audience have become pretty desensitized. I know I lost MY innocence when I saw that cartoon of Godzilla stepping on Bambi.

The DVD's bonus material includes audio commentary by producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal. ""Decloaking the Invisible: Alien Terrain"" is the Behind the Scenes featurette (00:10:41 minutes long). Click on the ""Motion Comics"" selection and you're presented with motion comics vignettes labeled under ""Moments of Extraction"" and ""Crucified"" and voiced by the actors of PREDATORS. To break it down even more, ""Moments of Extraction"" briefly fleshes out the back stories of Isabelle (00:02:15 minutes) and Mombasa (00:02:06), while the dialogue-absent ""Crucified"" chronicles the capture of the weaker Predator (00:02:08).

Drawing from a script he had originally penned in the mid-90's, Rodriguez teamed up with director Nimrd Antal (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vacancy/dp/B000RGN2JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vacancy</a>"") in an effort to restore the series to its roots.

Although there's no Arnold Schwarzenegger or even a ""CHOPPAH!"" to be found, ""Predators"" succeeds in delivering the same high-octane thrills as the original film. Although admittedly not as fueled by testosterone as its predecessor, ""Predators"" gets by with a solid cast that includes Adrien Brody as the unlikely hero of the story, as well as Alice Braga, Danny Trejo and Topher Grace. Dumped on an alien planet against their will, this group of unsavory characters finds themselves being hunted by a gaggle of bizarre and deadly creatures, the least of which being the titular character(s). Brody has big shoes to fill - essentially replacing Arnie as Dutch - and wouldn't you know it, the Oscar winning actor pulls it off. Laurence Fishburne also appears, making the best of a brief appearance. Fishburne chews up the screen and steals just about every scene in perhaps his juiciest role since ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>.""

The film certainly has the Rodriguez touch, but Antal definitely puts on a good show on his own. Not only does the film look good (taking advantage of its Hawaiian location), but it is every bit as fast-paced and fun as it should be, too. The only real flaw at hand would be that the central characters aren't fleshed out enough for us to truly connect with them. While the actors themselves turn in fine performances, it's the fault of the script for not giving us enough to care about when the group starts getting picked off one by one. In the end, though, it doesn't serve to tear down the good times at hand. ""Predators"" is a more than worthy trip back to the jungle and aims to please its core audience. Possibly the most faithful sequel in recent memory, it's worth watching to be reminded of a time when sci-fi and action were at their peak and goofy looking creatures from across the universe rocked our collective world.",1287878400,,3264,6.415909090909091

Unfortunately, the movie falls into the same trap most other action thrillers do -- that is there's so much focus on creating yet another  gore scene that the story must degrade at all cost to support that fetish.

In its first 65 minutes, this movie did a fair job of character development while keeping it interesting, mysterious, somewhat logical, good Special Effects, good humor injections at appropriate times, good soundtrack, good acting/directing, sufficient action, and thank God none of that stomach turning, teenager pleasing shaky camera! All that convinced this viewer that the film was going to evolve and climax into some brainy twist (or an intelligently executed scape plan) for the ending. But no... All that changed when it suddenly shifted gears to follow that old tired video gamish shoot-them-up mindless action.

Hopefully, the sequel (which it seems to imply there's one) will undo some of the shortcommings -- but how often do we get that from Hollywood?",1287878400,2,1066,4.977528089887641

They could have had the ""team"" feeling again WITHOUT the same story. I can't even give this a 4 star rating. I didn't feel like COOL this was pretty good. I felt, it was so so at the end when I turned it off. Yes they did add a few new monsters (the dogs were cool) but then they kept adding the old sayings and movements. Everytime I heard or saw something from part 1 set my mood backwards. I didn't feel that edge of my seat feeling I had with part 1.

The top down shot at the end of the battle was especially good. I also enjoyed the respect for the Bushido each combatant showed for the other in classic samurai style. It was an elegant serene moment in am otherwise completely chaotic scene. If you are a fan of Samurai movies be sure and look for it. Overall this movie was much better than brainless violence and 2 dimensional script that I anticipated (thanks to Adrian Brody), it had some surprisingly creative moments.",1287792000,4,854,4.516129032258065
4037144,3,B002ZG98LO,"Glancing at the other reviews, it's apparent that most people have a 'love it or hate it' attitude toward this film.  Both extremes generally seem to spring from the sincere appreciation of the first 'Predator' film, if not the entire franchise - if the 'Predator' films, any or all, are one of your sacred cows, then you may also find yourself 'loving or hating it'.  I certainly enjoyed both 1 and 2 for the type of film that they were (I might even give 2 an edge over the original because Danny Glover is a better actor than Schwarzenegger), and thought AVP was, at best, a weaker effort, but 'Predators' is EXACTLY the same as those others - fun in some ways, weak in others, and neither the worst piece of garbage ever, nor a five star action classic.

Eight people wake up in free-fall, chutes opening automatically just in time.  Most of the eight are heavily armed, though some are not, and all are suspicious of the other while attempting to find out where they are and why.  Eventually, they discover that they have been brought to an alien planet - which functions as a game reserve - to be hunted by the race of Predators.  That's about all there is to it - will they survive or not?

Simple plots can make fun and entertaining movies - this is no exception.  There's no heavy lifting here - most of the movie plays out the way one might expect, and even the surprises are unveiled in unsurprising ways.  In a not-so-subtle subtext, these eight, whom we discover are all predators themselves, albeit in the normal Homo Sapien visciousness that we've come to know and love, are put in a situation where they must decide if they are all hunter, as the Predators are, or whether any shred of humanity is left within them.

That's the good part.  However, 'Predator' has faults that can't be ignored.  A film like this depends for its success on creating a fantasy that is coherent enough and quick enough to keep the viewers from shaking off his willingness to go along with it.  One such moment that fails this simple test is when the band of humans walk for hours, under clear skies, and then emerge at a cliff-side and only then notice several other planets hanging over three-quarters of the sky.  This isn't a terrible fault, but the film has to work to get me back after that.  More serious is the modern action film stereotype of the hard-as-nails female, even if played well here by Alice Braga.  I don't have a problem with a strong female character (I think there are few better action leads, male or female, than Sigourney Weaver in 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but too often these characters strike me as a sop to special interest groups.  I am absolutely positive there are women like the one in 'Predators' - but it's their de rigueur appearance I object to.

A stronger fault of the film is a missed opportunity - while Lawrence Fishburne has lost the edginess I thought he had in films like 'The King of New York', his screen time is cut way too short here as he does an excellent job with what he's given - and the same can be said for the always impressive Danny Trejo.  Cuchillo, we hardly knew ya.  And the subplot involving the Topher Grace character comes to an untimely conclusion, or else it's that Topher Grace always seems a bit silly to me, and his involvement simply can't be taken seriously.

But this film ultimately fails to be all it can be with the choice of Adrian Brody as the lead.  Whether or not anyone accepts this film will hinge on whether they can accept the artificially gravel-voiced Brody as an amoral mercenary tough guy.  Forget comparisons to Arnold - it doesn't have anything to do with that.  Brody just does not have it within his repertoire to play this kind of character.  He can certainly do action films - 'King Kong' proved that - but he's out of his depth here.

Even though 'Predators' is only entertainment, it still should be true to itself.  With a different lead, it might have been worth another half or even full star, but Brody just can't pull his bulked up weight here (I would have liked to have seen Danny Trejo in the lead).  Three stars, but still some fun.",1287792000,,4131,4.493975903614458

4037146,1,B002ZG98LO,"'Predators' not only does nothing to advance the series, it actually takes steps backwards.

I just finished watching it and it only makes me think of what could've been rather than what it is. In short, I believe the writers and director tried to recapture the magic of the first 'Predator' so much that it actually weighed the movie down like an anchor that wouldn't allow it to go forward. I understand paying homage to the original and making winks and nods throughout the movie for the fans of the franchise, but the excess here just stunk of laziness. The problem was that they didn't know how to do it so they just ended up reinacting whole scenes from the original. It also didn't help that the soundtrack sounded like they just played the original Predator, right over this one. They hit just about every music track from it. Again, they could've been creative and mixed it up with a new score and hints of the original but instead, they just replicated it.

Where they really blew it was with the characters. Instead of military, special forces, or even common people, they give us a bunch of disgusting criminals, rapists and murderers from around the world. Why doesn't that work? Because who cares if they all get picked off and slaughtered one by one. We shouldn't want that to happen but I found myself thankful everytime another one bit the dust. If they're gonna ape the original Predator so much, then make these people likable enough that we'd like to see them actually make it to the end. And whoever wrote the script doesn't seem to know how to go five words without the F word either. Again, more laziness. I would've also like to learn more about the Predator's but it was all stuff we've seen before. They also seemed weaker and easier to defeat.

Another missed opportunity is that we actually get to see another planet where the Predator's do their ritual hunts, but it would be hard to know it, because just as the characters pointed out, it looks similar to certain areas here. Why not show us something new? Some place so obviously different that you can't help but know your somewhere else?

And finally, the plot holes. The very beginning starts off good enough by bringing questions to the surface but they never really get answered. Characters appear and begin to reveal something but it never follows through as to why they're doing what they're doing or where they came from. It just seems like they threw alot of ideas out there but they never strung them together. The end almost comes off like a set up for a sequel but without a cliffhanger to keep us going. If that isn't the plan, then why not wrap it up and explain everything to us?

Sufice it to say, I didn't like 'Predators' and won't be watching it again. For my Predator fix, I'll stick with the first 2 and AVP. Actually, AVP looks alot better in comparison to this and I'm looking forward to seeing it next. Predator fan or not, try before you buy.",1287792000,31,2948,4.554716981132075
4037147,4,B002ZG98LO,"Ok let me just be the first to say I hated the AVP movies.  They were just flat out terrible in every single way and almost ruined my love of the predator ( if you can acutally love such a butt ugly thing).  I had lost all hope and when I heard about this movie I cringed.  But, I can happilly say I was wrong.

This movie is great, a very worthy addition to the predator movies.  I have had a big gripe with the pacing in recent movies, Clash of the Titans as an example. But Predators gets it done just right.  You get the right enough of the characters backgrounds to make you understand them and see where they're coming from.  Though its not really hard, everyone's a ruthless killer, but still they get it done.  The acting was great and no one dragged the movie down.  Yes a couple people were a little flat and some were cliched, when we see Danny Trejo in a movie we know where he's gonna end up....

Some people could say the movie was complete fanservice. Referencing the first movie, adding an old school predator and a very nice ""in with the old and out with the new"" to the predator style.  But what can I say Rodriguez did it right and he knew who he was trying to target.  Predator samurai fight scene complete with wavy grass anyone?

Comparisons to Cube, Hypercube, etc are interesting since Hypercube in my mind is the definition of unintelligent, saying words like fourth dimension, hypercube, theoretical mathematician, theoretical physicist, etc yet giving no meaning to those words since the author didn't know anything except the word itself.  This much is obvious just from the ""oh you made it through? bang your dead. the end"" , having to think of an ending let a lone a coherent plot nah that's too much work...So anyways!!! Predators!

4037149,4,B002ZG98LO,"First off, every Predator fan should see this movie.  Was it better than the original?  No, but I think it was better than Predator 2 and light years beyond AVP.

I'll talk about the cast first.  A lot of people have problems with Adrian Brody playing the lead and if you're one of those people (whether you've seen the movie or not) I will to try to convince you otherwise.  Arnold was badass in the first film and it would be a mistake to try to recreate his character through someone else.  Getting an Arnold-esque lead would have just been competing (quite lamely) with the original.  Casting buff dudes to fight Predators has already been done, it was done right the first time, and it just doesn't need to be done again.  That said, take a look at Poncho.  That's basically Adrian Brody right there and he was equally respected and just as bad as the rest of them.  He was also the last one to die.  You don't need to be ripped to pieces to be a badass.  Case in point...watch the famous UFC fight between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock.  So, if you liked Poncho in the first movie, then I see no reason why you shouldn't like Brody in this one.

People have problems with Topher Grace too, but after seeing him in the first scene I knew he was going to be a win.

Alice Braga plays one of the strongest female characters I have ever seen.  She can whoop some ass.

I like the cast and I think it fits with the Predator mindset.  They want to hunt and they want a challenge.  They don't have a favorite body type, just favorite skulls and trophies.  You don't have to be ripped, you don't have to be male, you don't have to be good or bad, or have a certain personality, you can be anything as long as you have a weapon and some fight in you.

Bottom line is watch it.  If you're a fan you won't be disappointed.

[SPOILERS]

Some things I didn't like:
------------------------------------------------
* Thought it wasn't quite believable that after they landed on the planet their first instinct would be to kill anyone they saw.  Royce didn't have that gut instinct, but I was wondering why Nikolai was going nuts with the chain gun.  He's supposed to be a hardened warrior, but it looks like he's panicking.  Seems like he would just try and figure out what was going on like Royce.  Just wasn't that believable for me.

* The scene where they're all firing into the jungle like in the first movie.  First movie did that, there was a good reason, and this time the scene just didn't carry as much weight.

* ""Go on!!!  Do it!!!""  First movie did that and for a much better reason.  I know they're paying homage to the first, but there didn't seem like a good reason for him to say it at that point.

* Noland's arrival.  Ahhh no......reminds of that kid in Jurassic Park 3 who manages to find a way to survive with all the deadly dinosaurs...cheesy.  Arnold could barely survive a few days with one Pred and this guy manages to survive 10 years with many Preds, dog Preds, aliens, and who knows what?  Just not believable to me.  Not only that, but just like in JP3 how the kid's hair is way too nice and he just looks way too clean...Noland suffers the same thing.  His shirt and face are near spotless.  The only way they really salvaged his character was by making him crazy and wanting to kill all the others so he could take their stuff lol.  I started liking his character more at that point because after living on a planet like that for 10 years you probably would be a little crazy.

* Danny Trejo goes down way too easy.  I wanted to at least see him in a good fight.

Some things I liked:
--------------------------------------------
* Choice of cast.  Already stated, Alice Braga, perfect acting.  Don't see many females who can make badass look second nature, but Braga pulls it off flawlessly.  Adrian Brody, cool, new kind of hero for a Pred movie.  Walton Goggins (Inmate), funny as hell.  Topher Grace plays a good psychopath.  Overall the interaction between all the characters was better than I thought it would be.

* Stayed true to the original look of the Preds.

So, things I didn't like were kind of nitpicky, but there were a lot more things I did like about this movie.  Overall it's a good movie and worthy of the Predator franchise.",1287705600,,4268,4.410783055198973
4037150,4,B002ZG98LO,"Like one of the reviewers on the product page, I went into the theater thinking ""OK, let's get this film over and done with"". I remember seeing Predator in my early teens and absolutely loving it, then seeing Predator 2 maybe a year later and thinking it was garbage. And 2 ""Alien Vs. Predator"" piles of crap didn't help either, despite AVP: Requiem being somewhat gory fun. So I cast all worries aside, turned off my brain and just decided to sit back and let the film begin.

And I walked out of the theater surprised that they managed to make a film that works not only as a sequel, but a standalone movie! Of course, I wasn't expecting anything Shakespeare or Art House, and therefore I managed to enjoy it well enough.

This film finds us with a number of unknowns who wake up after being dropped into a strange jungle. There's something odd about this jungle though- according to the girl in the military, this wasn't like any jungle. Of course it's not long before the discover the horrifying truth- they're on a rock in Outer Space! After doing some discovery, they gind out they are soon being hunted by the Predators. But there's more than just THOSE predators- these people could kill each other off even if there weren't any!

Of course, nothing is amazing about the plot and we've seen it 23 years ago. But do give this film a chance; if you need some nice and brainless fun, just go in and enjoy the show. The film is full of action and there is a LOT of gore, and Adrien Brody is a frackin BEAST. There's a lot of funny scenes too, and so therefore, if just entertainment is what you want, be sure to check this out.",1287705600,2,1631,4.376237623762377

These tactics include standing around, un-cloaked, and growling.  They've tried to turn it into a horror film.

I was around to witness the first Predator in the movie theater, and I loved it, re-watching it many many times in my teen years.  Did not care for Part 2, and absolutely hated the AVP crossovers.  So along comes this movie, with a small dude in the lead role, and an almost identical setting as the first.  Why not just call it a remake with horribly bad casting?  I had no hope of liking this movie, but I thought I'd give it a chance anyway just to see ""how much is this gonna suck?""

Well, the answer is: not at all!  The original set the stage for this one, and I fully appreciate that, but this is a far better movie than any other in the franchise, including the first.

Adrien Brody is spectacular in this, and was actually a perfect fit.  As far overboard as Arnold took his character, this is how grounded and real Royce feels.  He's the good guy, but even the good guy has his flaws, just like everyone else.  And, by the way, those flaws are totally understandable.  Amazing job.

Mirrored scene: the way the Japanese dude stood up to the Predator, similar to the way Billy tried to hold his ground on the bridge in the original.  Different result though, and one of the coolest scenes in the movie, very similar to an old Kung Fu/Samurai flick.

I loved the way the Classic Predator was smaller and weaker than the Black Super Predator, as if to say, ""yeah remember that one that Arnold killed, weak.  This one is the real badass.""

Another small touch that I really liked was the fact that the guy and girl both survive.  In the original, it was all about ""I'm the tough guy, I survive on my own.""  Well, times have clearly changed: ""We, as a couple, are stronger together.""  Huh.  Family values creeping into a gory action flick.  A nice touch, I thought.

One reviewer said that he had to wait an hour for the action to start.  I have no idea what he was waiting for.  The opening scene shows the main character waking up in freefall onto a mysterious alien planet.  And from then on, the action is relentless.

So, I went into this movie expecting a complete mess, and I ended up going on a wonderful ride.  The best action movie I've seen in a long while, and I expect many repeat viewings.  The bar has been set to a new high for the Predator franchise.",1287705600,6,2288,4.330188679245283

My favorite science fiction movie of 2010. It is much better than the last one. Just don't expect the 1st one...you could never match it.....you already know the premise now....so don't expect surprises as you had in the 1st one. If you watch the details of this one , there is a lot of subtle info that you are probably missing. I went to the Predators website and it gave a lot more background info that you may not realize unless you are extremely attentive in the movie. Like there are 2 different types of predator in this movie and they have different weapons. One is more advanced in a lot of ways and bigger. A lot of people missed this , but it is obvious if you pay attention.",1287705600,,824,4.15625
4037196,5,B002ZG98LO,"Predators is a nice attempt at recapturing some of the Predator mystic. We begin with characters literally falling from the sky, with what seem to be time-activated chutes around them. Each of these people have the weapons they had on them from the last thing they could recall, and all of them seem dangerous - except for one. At first they think they are in a jungle, but that jungle idea falls through when they find they cannot get an accuate bearing on their location, the sun doesn't move, and some other - odder - things. Eight people in the woods, on a walk that might well kill them.
Fun.

I personally like Predators because it held the mystery that the first movie had. There is a lot of ground and there are lots of guns, and the people being hunted are not the nicest people that you might meet. A merc, an assassin, yakuza, and other round out the group. also doing this group justice is the caliber of the actor. They make a lot of things believeable that would otherwise be hard to buy.

The one oddity here is L. fishburn who does something I would not have expected. Still, that makes for a good movie because, really, you shouldn't be able to predict things so easily. He's actually funny an this is an odd departure for him.
I liked.

The Predators here also are different in some ways, keeping the goods we know but adapting to their playground. Other things are here as well, and those things make the place interesting. There are some gimmicks (chaingun, some of the traps you see here and there) are not new, but they are not overwhelming in the plot. What is nice to note is that this is a new movie for fans and people who just want to try the series on once more.

Nice stuff - 4.5 stars or more.",1287705600,,1723,4.341614906832298

It didn't bother me at all, just something to be aware of. Kids typically love films like this, but the course and grim reality of this is so true to life, you leave the film wondering about the possibility of survival -- and not the possibility of it being a reality.

After reading all the reviews, including the most noted one from Chicago, ahem, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who thought this.

The film is lush, noir and very disturbing.

Adrien Brody is probably the biggest surprise of this, as one wonders if he could pull a role like this off. He does it so well, I wondered why hadn't he tried other similar action films before. He's incredibly convincing and has very good, but not campy, Batman voice that seems to nod directly at Christian Bale for emoting emotional darkness.

Very glad that creative and intelligent minds are keeping this idea and franchisee alive. Well done. Can't wait for another.

For the record, this was an idea that Robert Rodriguez came up with back in the  1980's after watching the original Predator film. This was also one of the first, of several, Screenplays that he wrote. His original screenplay was rewritten, adjusted and re-visioned however as the writing credit goes elsewhere. He talks about it in the special features and also the Director's commentary.

4037198,1,B002ZG98LO,"In the special features section of this movie there is a comment as to how the original ""Predator"" movie was so good because of ""attention to details"". Well, this sequel should have listened to it's forebear because the lack of attention to details makes it so bad.
(1.) Dialogue was comic book juvenile. Not very imaginative from writers with G.E.D.s. Especially the really weak and time worn military jargon and small guy tough talk obscenities.
(2.) Opening scene: Why people are falling out of the sky with parachutes even though they wouldn't normally have parachutes makes no sense.
(3.) The characters responses to their unusual situation was not natural even a child would have had more intelligent reactions. Just felt too scripted for filming reasons.
(4.) The random massive firepower released by our prey made no sense given their backgrounds. Why is there always an unlimited ammo supply. Must be a visual compensation for poor storyline and acting.
(5.) Predictable pecking order of to who gets killed and none of our prey even tried to intelligently solve how to rescue their  trapped or wounded comrades. The so called misplaced Doctor was just dumb.
(6.) Amazing how rapidly the environment changed by just walking for a few hours as they went from swampy lowlands to high altitude alpine reforested trees to desert to grassy meadows.
(7.) A poorly painted backdrop of neighborly planets so large and so close that the gravitational field would have ripped their planet into dust.
(8.) The usual clunky alien craft that looked like it had parts from a 19th century salvage yard and thus would have had the mobility of a rock.
(9.) Overall,  given the usual costume and fireworks props, bland acting, stereotypic dialogue confusing story line there isn't anything noteworthy in this sequel.",1287619200,15,1806,5.036789297658863
4037199,3,B002ZG98LO,"Unfortunately, The predator franchise hit its high peak in 1987 with its original movie.  A mediocre sequel followed as well as a pair of terrible Alien vs. Predator movies. Now over twenty years later 20th Century is hoping to resuscitate the predator franchise, but will this be another classic or just another in a line of disappointing sequels?

Based on a 1994 script written by Robert Rodriguez the movie makes a brave but ultimately smart decision bringing the setting away from earth to the home planet of the predators. The movie starts with all the characters literally falling from the sky with no idea where they are or how they got there. The predators have assembled a group of the most dangerous humans and brought them to their world for the sport of killing them.

This group of human mercenaries, serial killers, soldiers, and gangsters are lead by Royce, who is played well by Adrian Brody. He embodies the 21st century American soldier, lean, fit but not overly buff like the heroes of old. Topher Grace plays the mysterious Doctor Edwin who seems to be the only person who doesn't fit with the group due to his unimposing demeanor but perhaps it wasn't a mistake by the aliens after all. Walter Goggins (of The Shield) ads some moments of humor playing the deranged serial killer Stan, who was days away for getting the death penalty for his crimes.

The film is at its best in its first half as the characters slowly uncover what this place is and why they were brought here. It plays out like an episode of Lost as the characters make their way through the jungle uncovering strange occurrences and slowly putting the pieces together. Hungarian Director Nimrd E. Antal does a nice job at building the suspense and tension in the first half of the movie before the second half of the film derails.

The last half of the film plays out like your typical Sci-fi-horror movie. There is plenty of violence and gore but it is at the cost of the narrative. Like too many movies today the action scenes are almost impossible to follow with quick, flashy cuts and loud fast paced music. The film draws to an end with a predictable ending leaving it wide open for a sequel.

In the end, Predators is not a bad movie but it is almost two movies in one. The first half is a good mysterious science fiction movie and the last half is generic science fiction horror.  The special effects are effective as the filmmakers tried to go with real humans in costumes whenever it was possible and this definitely ads to the believability and menace of the predators. Somewhere deep inside this film is the blue print for a much better movie and partially falls flat due to the promise of its first half. If you are a fan of the series you will not be disappointed and you could have gotten much worse. On the other hand, people looking for an intelligent and cohesive narrative may be disappointed.",1287619200,,2900,4.608527131782946

First off, the movie is not bad at all but it fails to improve on the original in several instances:
1st) Despite the new designs, new looks, & new effects of the creatures, there is NO REAL villainy or menace demonstrated by them in contrast to P1 & P2. I recall how it practically taunted & toyed with its victims B4 killing them (i.e.- Mac & Dillon in P1, the Jamaican ""hit""team in P2).....NONE of that creativity here. And where was the agility & athleticism that was demonstrated in the 1st 2 films, which left a LOT 2 the imagination, them being so huge (swinging & running along the jungle/treetops in P1 & climbing buildings/leaping along rooftops in P2)???? Several opportunities wasted!
2nd) How does a team of professional killers (each his own right?) suddenly ""rally around"" one man (Royce) without hesitation??? Couldn't they at least show SOME challenge 2 his sense of authority. It seems too cliched these days in a lot of movies 2 throw a bunch of ""strangers"" together & have them working together or following each other as a group almost immediately (BORING!). Still, the cast is mostly believable as individuals & made up of some pretty decent actors (Adrien Brody, Lawrence Fishburne, etc). At least the filmakers didn't try 2 sink the franchise by using an ALL pretty-looking TWILIGHT cast (EW-WWWW!!!!!). But then again, we R watching this movie 4 the Predators, right?
And speaking of- despite the mostly negative comments here regarding the ALIENVSPREDATOR series & the attempts by reviewers 2 separate it from the 1st 2 Predator films here at AMAZON, there is a bit of noticable homage (AVP) in this film- the Predator's holographic map/imaging system & the revelation by Noland that they hunt in groups of 3s (recall in AVP, it was 3 Predators that entered the Pyramid 2 begin their ""rite of passage"").
Poor Derek Mears who suited up as number of the creatures in this film! He clearly left NO impression in that God-AWFUL FRIDAY THE 13th POS ""remake"" (as Jason, of course) & he likewise does so (or doesn't depending how U look at it!)here. Any chance giving Kevin Peter (R.I.P. bro!)Hall's brother a phone call?
I had real high hopes 4 this film, the conventional wisdom being a sequel is SUPPOSED 2 follow & improve on the original (ALIENS/ALIEN, SPIDERMAN2/SPIDERMAN). It's not really that bad, truthfully.

""Robert Rodriguez"" name attached to a film is a WARNING. I will know next time, before I spend my money. I assume Robert Rodriguez takes pleasure in mis-casting film characters.

Text is half cut off and you may hit the ""left"" arrow on your remote and instead of going to the next item on the current pop-up, it takes you back to another option you never wanted. It's hard to explain unless you do it. sorry.
Another bad thing is, today, when you buy bluray, you usually get the bluray, a DVD and digital copy. You only get the bluray and digital copy for your $$. If you want a regular DVD, you have to buy it seperately.
That's about it for the bad. Really.
The new installment is well acted, well directed, well done in many ways! I actually watched it twice, I enjoyed it so much.
Adrien Brody, putting on some pounds and looking pretty intimidating in his hand to hand combat was pretty unexpected. His character as well, was well written and acted by Brody. He was a no guts, no glory, take no prisoners, in your face kinda guy and it was a good character for this kind of movie.
Supporting roles all had their own character traits tha tmade them interesting and you want to know more about them before the end of the movie. One instance is Topher Grace (Doc) who, as you learn, has his own secrets and if you watch, they hint at this through the movie. A Japanese man has very little dialogue but is still one of the coolest predators/prey in the movie. Lawrence Fishburne plays a guy who ""is the one that got away"" and has been on the planet long enough to be a little off his rocker. He plays this well.

My major issue was that they killed off Danny Trejo so early in the film; that's borderline unforgivable.

Rejoice fans, because we finally have another Predator film that manages to stand the same ground as the original Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle.

And they're all about to be hunted by a race of alien predators unlike anything they've ever imagined.

Right now: you're either in or out.  Odds are, you're in.  Considering that the franchise has only two real films (I'd rather discount the ALIEN tie-ins if it's all the same to you), and only one of those was really any good (admit it!), PREDATOR has been pretty damn popular.  You know the name brings with it sci-fi action/adventure, with a good dash of horror.  Artfully, none of the PREDATOR films (this one included) could possibly stand up to the first ALIEN, even though they have all tried to do so.  But you don't watch a PREDATOR film for art.  You watch it for the fun.

And PREDATORS is fun.  Plain and simple.  Lending the project credibility with his serious acting chops (mostly on hold here; he's camping it up with delight) is Adrien Brody, one of the more unlikely action heroes (though he carried his own in KING KONG, remember).  We've got Alice Braga as a tough-as-nails chick with attitude, Danny Trejo as a Mexican mercenary, and Laurence Fishburne giving a surprisingly good turn as a man who's been in-country a mite too long.  (It's interesting to see Fishburne and Brody, two genuinely good actors, playing off each other; kind of makes you wish there was more of that, but then again, that would be a whole different movie.)  We've got the prerequisite Japanese, Russian, and African toughies, and Topher Grace as a wise-cracking doctor.  (Grace is another highlight, at least until the final quarter of the film, and even then, I blame the writers.)  The Predators themselves look great--and we've got quite a variety, too.  I won't say the filmmakers have given them any emotional depth (they're freakin' Predators, man!), but it's nice to see some diversity.  And what a killer climax.

Overall, the film borrows heavily from the first, and that's okay--it's done with a wink and a nod.  They know it, you know it, let's get it out of the way and have some fun.  The atmosphere is tense, the cinematography spectacular, the pace adequately suspenseful.  The script falters a bit, and there's a ""twist"" near the end that is entirely pointless, and generally weighs the film down.  Still, for what it is--and that isn't much, granted--PREDATORS is a fine way to kill a Saturday evening.  Leave it to producer Robert Rodriguez to put a little umph back into a dying franchise, though one can't help but wonder what the film would've been like if Rodriguez had chosen to write/direct it as well.

4037251,5,B002ZG98LO,"A great film that stays true to the original Predator franchise instead of diluting the original story with the Alien vs. Predator franchise.  Adrien Brody definitely embodies what people do and think when they find themselves in a situation they do not understand.  I thought it was interesting when I found out there was an even more dangerous subspecies of Predator.  I liked that the new Predators shared traits with human hunters, such as bear traps, mechanical hunting falcons, and a pack of alien hunting dogs.  Whenever I watch this movie, the thought of being hunted by creatures of that kind of lethality.

Has anyone ever wondered (or looked up the fact) why these movies do better on indvd/bluray?

Pieces of the classic original are honored in this film such as the music and the overall environment of the movie itself. Some people say this is worse that the two AVP movies, but that's a load of crap. In my opinion this is up to par with the original itself. Just as Aliens was to the original Alien. It has its own story line, with a twist at the end many wouldn't expect. Some critics are upset because you don't get a real look at the predators until at least halfway through through the movie. Hello. You never saw the monster in the original until practically the very end! The whole point of them being hunters so that you can't see them when you're being hunted. This just shows that the director knew how to make this movie. He keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end. And its almost impossible to guess what will happen next.

This is nothing short of suspenseful and action-packed.  If you're familiar with the Predators series but was never really a fan, you're probably not going to like this film.

4037309,4,B002ZG98LO,"After the horrendous AVP (Paul W.S. Anderson, you owe the public an apology), and the even more insulting atrocity that was AVP2, I did not have high hopes for this film. Having had only 2 films made, the Predator franchise didn't really need a reboot yet. The end of the second movie, despite major flaws, hinted at some real possibilities and I would've liked to see where the franchise could've gone with Predator 3 going into the past (remember the flintlock pistol inscribed ""Raphael Adolini 1715""?).

John McTiernan's 1987 original is held in almost sacred regard by many and is widely considered one of finest action/sci-fi films ever made. It had great action, with a colorful ensemble cast, and its impact on popular culture is enormous (""if it bleeds, we can keel eet"" and other oft-parodied lines; and the basis for the cover of the Nintendo video game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contra/dp/B0009VRFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contra</a>, a legend in its own right). It certainly is in my top 5 sci-fi films, so any remake/reboot would have a steep uphill climb ahead of itself. Add a Hungarian director few people have heard of and you've got a lot of nervous Predator fans.

It's far from the taught, suspense-filled movie that the original was, but I'm glad to say that Predators is quite enjoyable, warts and all. It's a bit cheesy, with some stilted dialogue and a B-movie/low-budget feel, but overall, the film is entertaining. It gets off to a very rocky start and I was hostile to the movie for pretty much all of the first 30 minutes until the action picked up. It certainly doesn't have the star power or larger than life personalities of the original, although the action is solid and that's what we came for. Most of the iconic Predator moments are here, along with lines that pay homage to the original. The plot is the same, with slight twists and reinterpretations to make it new and familiar all at the same time.

As for criticisms, I won't be too harsh on this film because it's supposed to be mindless alien fun. As already mentioned, the characters are not nearly as memorable or as much fun as Arnold's original gang of bad-asses. Visually, there's a bit missing. Some of the jungle scenes looks really fake and is quite obvious that they were shot on a soundstage (over half of the film was shot in Texas for tax benefits). The gaunt Adrien Brody isn't totally convincing as a combat-hardened ex-military commando and mercenary, but he is quite likable all the same, as is the Yakuza character and mini-gun wielding Spetnaz commando Nikolai (sort of Jesse Ventura's counterpart in this film). A frequent Robert Rodriguez collaborator, leather-faced Danny Trejo's appearance in the film is all too brief. I wished he had a bigger role in the movie. Topher Grace is the only one who seems miscast and out of place. Lastly, is the wacky sound design. The soundtrack uses the same tribal-sounding percussion and horns motif that the original did, but it cuts in and out unexpectedly and lacks the focus and punch that Alan Silvestri's score had (listen to the end of ""Journey Trek"").

Worth watching if you're an action fan. Just don't take it too seriously or compare too much against the original. I'm looking forward to Predators 2, as there clearly will be one from the ending.",1286668800,2,3359,4.929328621908128

4037311,4,B002ZG98LO,"Let me start by saying that I grew up on the Predator films. The first Predator was my first favorite film. I was requesting to watch the VHS by name when I was barely three years old(say what you will about my upbringing lol). The second was a very solid sequel in my opinion because it did such a great job expanding the mythos and possibilities of the franchise. It had obvious problems, but it did a great job of making you understand the predators better.
But then came Alien VS Predator. Yeesh. Nothing about this movie was right. The predators being in the arctic, the aliens being stronger than Superman, the predators being morons, the humans being extremely annoying movie-stereotypes, all of it. It was trash in my honest opinion. Aliens VS Predator-Requiem was a step up, but not by much. The predator, dubbed The Wolf, was extremely cool, and the aliens acted more in character than they had in AVP, but the human characters again were movie-stereotypes and the movie was entirely too dark. I couldn't make out a lot of what was going on. It was like watching an episode from the first season of the X-Files, but worse.
But enough of that, this is a review for Predators, not its predecessors. I like using bullet-points, so here goes-

~The cast was phenomenal. Adrien Brody is a great actor and always brings something new to his roles. Alice Braga does a very good job as his counterpart. Topher Grace delivers every line with a hard to define quality that just makes him likable. Louis Changchien was excellent in his role as the silently stoic bad ass. But Lawrence Fishburne was a little out of place and seemed forced in. He could have been made a more natural plot device had they fleshed out his character more. But aside from that, the cast works wonders for this film, much like the first Predator film.

~The action was solid, delivering the goods, but it did feel a little too much like a tribute to the first Predator. Some parts pulled off the tribute better than others. Without spoiling anything, the ""Billy Bear Showdown"" sequence is actually pretty damn cool in Predators. And the film's equivalent of rolling around in mud for stealth to flank the predator was very clever.

~The mythos was expanded upon, but branched out more so than elaborating on what was already there. Though that's not a bad thing. The predators in this movie are from a different ""tribe"" than the ones from the previous titles. This explains their differences in behavior such as abducting humans and taking them to their jungle instead of going to the humans' jungle. But the new predators are also different in appearance, suggesting a divergent path of evolution possibly like Vulcans and Romulans. And when unmasked the new predators are wicked, to say the least.

~The plot was better than most action movies, and its not like the Predator movies need a complex and intricate plot to be worthwhile any how. The humans were abducted from Earth and dropped on this planet to be hunted. All of these humans are in fact killers themselves, making them very dangerous prey. Whereas previous targets for the predators have been chosen based on skills in combat and leadership, these people were chosen simply for their ability to kill others. Royce(Brody) reluctantly takes the role of leader to this group of murderers, but is more interested in his own safety than his team. Isabella(Braga) is the teams ""moral compass"" so to speak, and is usually in conflict with Royce's lack of morals and empathy. Edwin(Grace) is the outcast of the group as the only  normal person among them, seemingly picked by mistake. He also plays the comic relief to perfection. The rest of the characters fall into smaller roles and all play their parts in the classic breakdown from large group down to small group, being picked off by the predators. Noland(Fishburne), a years-long survivor on this planet, explains that these new predators and the predators we know from earlier films are at war. The new predators are leaner and meaner, and the ""old"" predators fight with honor. These people are just caught in their practice sessions.

What more is there to say? Predators easily trumps Predator 2, AVP and AVP-R as the best Predator sequel. If you liked the first then pick up Predators. It pays homage to the original but definitely carves out a spot in the franchise for itself.",1285804800,5,4373,4.762532981530343
4037312,5,B002ZG98LO,"Look, it is not really a FIVE Star film. Compared to the AVP ones it is, but it is really a solid 3.75 Star Film, but the fact that some people feel compelled to give it only a single star is Absurd and forced my equally absurd higher rating of FIVE.  If you liked the original, you can't help but like this one, as it is more of the same.  I loved the homages to the Original, and it was entertaining.  If you didn't like the original movie don't bother watching this one.  With that said, it was a good movie.",1285545600,2,511,4.02970297029703
4037313,1,B002ZG98LO,"I have always been a fan of the original Predator film, in fact it's one of my favourite action films from the 80's. The sequel was quite honestly awful and the Aliens vs Predator films shouldn't have even been made, they were so bad. So all-in-all this series hasn't got the best of reputations, despite it's awesome original and it's fantastic comic books. So when I heard that there was going to be a new movie I was a little disheartened but hearing Robert Rodriguez was attached made me feel a bit better about it.

Well, I watched this last night and I have to say I cannot believe that there is a film that is actually worse than AvP! The story is ridiculous. The characters are pathetic and are complete wannabes of the classic original line-up, but nowhere near as cool (if cool at all!) - and what's with Aiden Brody's Batman voice?? And what was honestly the point of Lawrence Fishburn's character? And Danny Trego was a wasted opportunity as he was the only real tough guy out of the whole cast. You don't actually get to see a Predator (other than the one tied up) for about 45 minutes - by then I'd already pretty much given up with the film that I didn't care when I saw one.

4037346,2,B002ZG98LO,"I just want to say I'm reviewing the movie itself here, not the DVD or Blu-ray since they are not yet released at the time of this writing, nor will I buy or rent the home video version of this stinker. I saw ""Predators"" on the Sunday night of it's opening weekend back in July and the stench of this lousy movie is still fresh in my mind. The original Predator is a terrific sci-fi action thriller. It's loud and dumb and full of macho dudes with huge guns tearing up the jungle. No one has ever mistaken Predator for an intelligent film. At the same time, Arnold's action vehicle remains one of the most emimently watchable pieces of pop culture cinema from the 1980s. It's been 23 long years since the first flick came out and I can't count how many times I've seen the film because it's really fun and easy to watch. Memorable location photography, fun characters, intense action and one great villian from outer space. Not that the first film was in any way original or groundbreaking, it was billed as ""Rambo"" meets ""Alien"". That's how it was sold and it worked like magic even though the critics mostly panned it. A lot of kids grew up on that movie, including me. Well those kids are now making movies of their own and here comes ""Predators"", the hamfisted quasi-remake-sequel thing to the original classic sci-fi monster movie. The people behind this new movie have probably immersed themselves in the Predator movies, videogames and comic books. Appearantly nothing good has come of it, because this movie plays like a endless in-joke between fans of the series. It has zero integrity or ideas of it's own.

I saw the trailers to Predators and I was enthusiastic about it. Depressed over the miserable Predator 2 with Danny Glover and absolutely disgusted by how pathetic the Alien vs Predator flicks were, I had some hope that the filmmakers were finally ready to set things right. Robert Rodriguez was involved, not as director, but that's ok. The director was Nimrod Antal and he did the effective little movie ""Vacancy"". The trailers were terrific. The Predators kidnap a bunch of human mercenaries and assassins, take them to the Predator home planet and hunt them on that turf. Great set up! Plus we finally get a jungle/forest atmosphere instead of L.A. or Antarctica ( ridiculous ).

I was going to go see this new film with a friend but I found out he had never seen the original movie! Yes, there are still men out there who have not seen that absolute essential classic of macho cinema. We rented the original movie the night before and watched it. Everyone was entertained, even me who has seen it countless times before. Then the next night, we head off to the movie theater. Talk about deja vu. There are entire sequences lifted from the original. Beyond the return of the memorable score, ( which I didn't mind at all ), there was that waterfall scene all over again, there was the Billy makes a stand scene regurgitated with a Yakuza gangster. It went on and on. The big ideas of this insipid film were things like C.G.I. Predator dogs, two different Predator races and Laurence Fishburne in a pointless cameo apperance.

The cast was in no way memorable. Adrien Brody does a lot of grunting but seeing him go toe to toe with the biggest, meanest, toughest alien was silly. Even Arnold was wiped out but Brody can handle things? Absurd nonsense. The other characters had little to no personality. Compare this lame squad with the likes of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Sonny Landham. And what about the chick with the big gun ( Alice Braga )? Does every action film need a chick with a gun? Finally... Topher Grace, the dork from ""That 70s Show"", doing his annoying schtick yet again. It's all a bit too much. The writing is subpar to say the least, the dramatic tension that one so desperately needs in a sci-fi thriller is completely non-existent. I didn't care about the fate of any character in the entire movie. The Predator mythology is barely expanded at all, we just find out that there is more than one race of predators and that they are at war with each other. Nothing more about the planet, it's history or anything. Brody just tells the audience, ""This planet is a game reserve and we're the game."" How does he know that? How did he figure that out in 15 minutes after just waking up in a sky diving freefall? Well, he doesn't know jack, it's just the poor mechanics of the screenplay that are working themselves out to give the audience information.

I could go on and trash this hapless film for all it's worth as a way of retribution for getting me into the movie theater and taking my money but I'll leave things on a good note. This movie is much better than the awful Alien vs Predator movies. At the same time, never did I imagine that I would actually think of Predator 2 as a decent film but man, that stupid sequel from 1990 is light years ahead of Predators. That sequel embellished the mythology, pumped up the action and the violence and had crazy Gary Busey, wild man Bill Paxton and of course Danny Glover.

Predators is a poor sequel and does nothing to add to the mystery of this venerable movie monster. It's a decent little midnight movie when you're alone at home with nothing to do before going to bed. That's the best I can say about it. I wish it was much better but it can't be when money and exploiting a lucrative property are the sole motives for this film's existence.",1284508800,8,5449,4.5561224489795915
4037347,1,B002ZG98LO,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie, but this is not a good ""predator"" movie.  In my opinion, it is even worse than the first A VS P movie.  Where to begin?  In terms of proper editing, there is one scene where one of the humans gets one of his legs trapped in a bear trap, and thus cannot walk or even stand-up.  However, in the next scene with him, he is standing-up AND walking without feeling any pain at all!  Then there is the brilliant plan of standing in one spot and waiting for the predators (who can see in heat vision, have laser cannons, and can cloak) to come and somehow kill them in the crossfire.  That is the dumbest plan I ever heard!  Also, early on in the movie, the main character finds out that predators cannot see humans if they are covered in mud.  However, none of the humans put any mud on themselves until the very end of the movie!  Also, Mr. Fishburne's character was a joke.  There is no way that a human could even wear a predator's outfit, much less cloak in it.  The humans were the stars of this film (if you can call them ""stars"") and sadly, the super predators all die in the dumbest ways.  I won't spoil the ways they die (they are killed in the most generic action-movie ways), but none of them lasted that long when the final fights started.  The samurai-esque scene was really dumb.  A super predator should be able to kill humans easily and should be much smarter than a classic predator (according to Mr. Fishburne's character in the movie).  However, a super predator falls for the exact same trap it set-up for the humans earlier.  How is that smarter?  In Predator, the predator was much smarter.  Also, the idea of heading into the predators' main base was not a very good plan at all.  The humans are supposed to be the toughest guys from Earth, yet even in the beginning of the movie, the Russian guy doesn't even know how to properly reload his chain gun!  How are we supposed to believe that he is one of the toughest guys from Earth if he cannot even reload his gun properly?  Then there is the last fight, which suffers from a really bad second-wind Hollywood ending that is completely illogical.  The final super predator doesn't even take its mask and laser cannon off.  In fact, you only see a super predator's face for about 5-10 seconds in the entire movie.  Oh, and a classic predator in this movie cannot even break 1 chain that has him tied up.  In the first Predator movie, the predator definitely would have been able to break this (he did lift up a huge piece of wood that landed directly on his head).  The romance in this movie also was forced.  I do not think that a ""predator"" movie should even have a romance in it, it should be just action.  The 1st predator movie didn't have a romance in it.  Mr. Brody, who stars at the main character in this film, does not look like a leader.  He comes up with dumb plans and he doesn't look that tough either, yet he manages to beat up a super predator much more savagely than Arnold hurt the classic predator in the 1st movie.  If you are going to have a tough guy as the lead character, he needs to look super-tough.  This guy looked like a whimp.  If they wanted to avoid having a character that looked like Arnold, they should've had someone that tries to outsmart the super predators in a believable way.  I was really angry when the movie ended because it was a total waste of money to watch it.  The final nail in the coffin was the Hollwyood second-wind part of the end fight.  I wouldn't even recommending renting this movie.  It stains the Predator movie series' name much, much worse than A VS P did.  If you absolutely must see this movie because it has predators in it, watch it at a friend's house.  This way, you can see this horrible movie without having to pay for renting it (assuming of course that your friend pays for the rental).  This movie is so bad that I will never watch it again.  They should make a Predator 3 movie that completely ignores this one (like Predators ignores Predator 2).",1283817600,15,4040,4.361930294906166

All the action looked real. All of the Predators (and other monsters) looked real. All of the acting is really good. Although I must say that I had a hard time swallowing Adrian Brody as the lead tough guy. Brody comes across as more of a softy to me. If I had to seek out a complaint it might be that Brody was a bit miscast, but not so much so that it took away from the thoroughly entertaining experience that I had with Predators.

The story is very similar to the first one. A group of mostly soldiers (or soldier types) are in a mysterious jungle and soon realize that there's a role reversal going on: they are no longer hunters, mercenaries or whatever; they are the hunted. And they are going to need a lot of firepower and strategy in order to walk away alive from the situation that they are in.

I guess if I had to ""unEarth"" another negative it would be that the storyline is quite familiar. But Antal and Rodriguez introduce enough new concepts and twists to keep this sequel pretty fresh looking and not as predictable as you may think. If you were a big fan of the 1987 cult classic like I was, I believe that you'll find that this 2010 reintroduction to the Predators will be a welcome one...like it was for me.

A few words of caution to anyone that saw my comment about bringing the kids to this movie: it is not a family film. It earns its R rating. I'm just a little more liberal when it comes to what I think will warp the little minds of today's youth. So use your discretion.",1283731200,34,3245,5.895744680851064
4037349,4,B002ZG98LO,"I'm happy to say that Predators is the sequel we've been waiting 23 years to see. I watched Predator 2 on Blu-ray the other night and while I think it's underrated by many, even I can't call it a worthy follow-up to the 1987 classic. Predators has more than it's share of copycat moments. The familiar jungle setting, dialogue (""over here""), music, and even though it's missing that creepy vibe of the original, it's all kinds of fun to watch, especially if you're a fan of the series. Let's just forget those two Alien vs. Predator movies were ever made.

Like the original, the team battling the Predators is small enough in size so you get to know them a little bit along the way, but they lack some of the simple charms. The acting may even be better this time around, but it's hard to beat two future governors and Apollo Creed fighting a 7 foot alien. Adrien Brody is one of the last people I would ever think of being an action hero, but he bulked up, put on his best Christian Bale era Batman voice, and pulled it off pretty darn well. Laurence Fishburne isn't in the film as much as the trailers would make you believe, but I liked the weirdness he brought to the role. There wasn't one cast member I hated, so that's always a plus, but I did feel the whole Topher Grace thing was too obvious. I also wish they got more use out of Danny ""Machete"" Trejo.

We now learn that the Predators themselves are broken down into two classes. The smaller ones we've seen before and look almost identical to the original predator, but the larger ones have a slightly different looking face and one huge lower jaw. At first I was not that crazy about having these different races of Preds fighting each other, as well as, the humans, but the idea grew on me. The creatures themselves look good, but they come across more bulky than agile, especially during the hand to hand fight scenes. At times I thought I was watching the WWE galactic edition.

The CGI is good 90% of the time (still not sure about those alien dogs) and unlike Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, you can actually see what's going on in the action sequences. The gore level is average. It would have been nice to see some more creative kills from various Predator weapons, instead of just the wrist blades and shoulder cannons.

I still wish Robert Rodriguez would have not only produced, but directed, like he initially planned, but Nimrd Antal gives us a film worthy enough to sit beside Predator on my DVD shelf. Now bring on the sequels or I'll really hate that open ending.",1283644800,6,2539,4.4655172413793105
4037350,4,B002ZG98LO,"A lot of hardcore fanboys dismissed this film for various reasons, one being that it might have had a few too many references to the original film. While that's somewhat true, it really doesn't lower the films quality whatsoever. I think the problem was that too many people WANTED to dislike this, but if you just take it for what it is, which is an awesome B-movie and just try to be entertained, you might enjoy it. That is, if you like the first two Predator movies.

Coming from a huge fan of both original movies, Predators does the franchise justice. The characters are nothing like the ones in the AVP movies, in a sense that you actually care about who dies. There isn't a substantial amount of development on every character, but the ones that grow the most throughout the film are the best ones to watch. Is Brody Arnold? Not really, but he does make a good performance here.

One of the coolest things the film introduces to the series, is essentially a new breed of super kick-ass Predators. I really liked how they captured the suspense, tension and fear that the original Predator conveyed in the first movie, especially in the first act.

It's not perfect by any means but it's still pretty epic. I would give it an 7.5 or 8 on a 10 scale, a good score compared to the AVP films.

4037351,4,B002ZG98LO,"So this new predators could have been atrocious. It could have been done as poorly as the Alien Vs Predator series but low and behold this film was incredibly good. It was a nice throw back to the original Predator which was a cheesy film with two future governors in it, laden with so bad it's good one liners. This new film is kind of the same cheesy dialogue but good fun all the same. It reminds you why you fell in love with the first one.

The plot is basically a group of people chosen for some reasons (find out for yourself)get thrown on a other planet which they quickly find out is a game preserve for you guessed it Predator. Come to find out there are more than Predators on this planet there are some other creatures the Predator brought to this planet for them to hunt. For the most part that is the basic plot and that's all I will write. From the very beginning it's non stop action with a small scene towards the end that slows things down. The acting and action are both excellent and what you would expect if you go in not expecting a Oscar contender but simply expecting a fun follow up to a great action film.",1282867200,2,1131,4.236111111111111
4037352,4,B002ZG98LO,"Predators was tasked with the impossible job of setting a bruised and battered series back on course while reminding people of the great film that christened the endeavor from the beginning. After the Aliens vs. Predator  films regulated the predators to bystanders in the sub-hack-and-slash horror genre, it had become evident that it was time for something different. I'm pleased to say that, while hardly the classic of the first film, Predators  manages to inject new life into a science fiction concept that is both exceedingly simple but also capable of a myriad amount of variation.

Predators begins with Royce (Adrien Brody) plummeting through the atmosphere, unconscious. He realizes that he has been equipped with a parachute that deploys automatically, saving us from an incredibly short film. Confused and lost, Royce finds himself in the middle of an unknown jungle, but still armed with whatever weapons were, presumably, on him before being whisked away. By starting in media res, the film shows the audience that it is interested in the same sort of lean, no nonsense storytelling of the first film. When Royce comes across several others who have been stranded along with him, including a Yakuza decked out in a full business suit, a wisecracking criminal, a female sniper, and, strangely enough, an ordinary primary care physician, among others, each character is drawn with nothing more than a quick sketch. We don't need to know these guy's backgrounds, we merely need to know that the series is going back to the mercenaries versus predators formula that has served it well in the past.

In one of the better scenes of the film, the stranded mercs come to a clearing to discover a series of strange moons and planets midway between waxing and waning in an alien sky. This is the twist that the predator sequels have been looking for ever since Predator 2 way back in 1990. By pushing the film outside of our solar system, the filmmakers have opened up a whole set of possibilities. The castaways not only discover that they are stranded on a game preserve (a twist that more closely allies the film with the short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game""), but also suggests that there is some sort of civil war brewing between the predators. While many of these ideas are not fully capitalized on, they still show a sense of imagination and an earnest attempt to show the audience something we haven't seen in a predator film before. I especially enjoyed the showdown between the katana wielding Yakuza and a predator, a scene that begs the question, did the predators ever visit feudal Japan? Perhaps this can be explored in the sequel, Predatorses.

But even as the film attempts to show us something new, there is also a back to basics mentality in Predators. The events of the first film are even recounted by the sniper, Isabelle, who explains how Dutch managed to defeat a predator. This is a smart maneuver because it avoids unnecessary scenes in which the characters rediscover the strengths and weaknesses of the predators, finally catching up with the audience. It also tells us to ignore most of the sequels, suggesting that this is the true heir McTiernan's original, a connection the film highlights each time Alan Silvestri's original score swells. But Predators (plural) never quite matches the storytelling quality of Predator (singular). The tension between the castaways in Predators isn't used as well as the tension between Dillon and Dutch's team of mercenaries. The story itself seems somewhat episodic as the humans stumble along from one danger to the next, seemingly without a plan.

The biggest curiosity of the film, however, is perhaps the strange turn by Adrien `The Pianist' Brody. There is a certain amount of logic behind casting the wiry Brody in the role, since Danny Glover was also a step down from the vein popping biceps of Schwarzenegger. I'm pleased to say that Brody handles the role of action hero well. Not only has he trained for the role, but he manages to affect a gravel crusted voice that gives off enough of an I-don't-care attitude for us to believe that this Polish piano player is now a hardened killer. No, if there is any fault in the film it does not lie with Brody. It is the fact that the film, for all of its ideas, never fully comes together in order to create something greater than the sum of its parts. For many, this means there will be plenty of arguments about which is the true heir to the original film, Predator 2 or Predators.",1282867200,,4510,4.835492227979275
4037353,4,B002ZG98LO,"I went to see this movie during a Saturday afternoon matinee, where I had a few hours to kill. I enjoyed this movie so much and there was so much going on with the story, that I went back on Sunday evening, the next day, to watch it again and was just as entertained looking for the nuances and details in the movie. Similar to Avatar, which I also watched twice during a 2 week period, I caught a lot more information the second time around. I fully intend to purchase the movie as soon as it is available on DVD. I hope there is a director's cut with additional footage. I went in with low expectations, but was throughly pleased and surprised. I also enjoyed the new twist in the story between the two Predator species...I am sure this will lead to more interesting sequels:)",1282608000,,778,4.335616438356165
4037394,4,B002ZG98LO,"I have been an avid Predator fan since the Governor of California first tangled with one in the jungles back in 1987.  I wasn't swayed a few years later when the black cop from Lethal Weapon took one of the same alien species out amidst gang warfare in a (then) futuristic Los Angeles.  I stuck with it even through the AVP disaster (redeemed slightly by the second effort).  Naturally, it was with extreme trepidation that I went into Predators; first showing on opening day.  Robert Rodriguez's past film efforts coupled to some pretty tantalizing trailers was enough to put Paul WS Anderson's folly aside.  Now that the material has had a few hours to settle in, I can state that the piece lived up to my expectations.

To clear the air right from the get-go, this is perhaps the theoretical sequel fans of the original have been waiting 23 years for.  In fact, one of my few complaints is that the picture comes dangerously close to emulating the first film in multiple occasions.  On the whole, there are enough diversions and new concepts presented to dismiss fears of it simply being a ""redo"", but Rodriguez very well may have studied the original a bit too closely in his pre-production inspiration.  More on that later.

That said the film opens in an undisclosed time period but presumably present day based on some of the dialog shared throughout the movie and it does so with alarming efficiency; namely in the form of Adrien Brody's character plummeting toward the jungle from the stratosphere.  He, along with several other humans, land within the very Earthen-like jungle only to slowly discover that they had been abducted from their daily lives and apparently deposited on some alien world.

In keeping with the Predator franchise's mythos, they are allotted weapons ranging from machine guns to pocketknives to aid them in their mission; in this case simply surviving.

I mentioned similarities to the original and right from the onset there are many! From the obvious jungle setting once again to the Gatling gun being used to clear foliage, on down to moments like a very warthog like alien being stabbed in the chest with a straight blade, a human-built net trap complete with swinging log, and an accidental tumble while being pursued by the Predator off a cliff into a quick moving river/ waterfall.  There's even a moment where the ""insightful guy"" decides he has run long enough from the mysterious predators and turns back from the group in effort to challenge their pursuer with nothing more than a sword. Combine these onscreen moments with a John Debney score that was deliberately designed to mimic Alan Silvestri's (who was busy scoring The A-Team) work on the original 1987 film and it becomes easy to experience a little dj vu.  Now that I think about it, even the ending credits roll to ""Long Tall Sally"" once more.

The film's structure is similar to the original as well with a slow building methodical first half linked to a fairly action-packed conclusion.  And none of these revelations are mere conjecture as when asked where he drew inspiration for how to make this film, Robert Rodriguez was quoted as saying he was inspired what to do from the original Predator, and what not to do by Predator 2 and both AVP efforts. Interestingly he also went on to say that he drew no inspiration whatsoever from the Predator comics.

The piece, which was shot in a fairly brisk 53-day span, introduces Adrien Brody in his first appearance as a genuine tough-guy and to answer the immediate question, yes he pulls it off for the most part.  Taking a cue from Christian Bale's vocal performance as Batman, Brody delivers a forceful (if forced) gruff snarl that makes up for his lack of physical proportions typically considered requisite for the role.  The remaining cast is solid as well, with nothing extraordinary to report but no glaring flaws/ miscasts to complain about either.  Alice Braga continues the tradition of casting a Latin lead actress in the film and this is further cemented by the fact that Rodriquez himself has stated that the project is intended to be a part of the Predator franchise (making it Predator 3 by definition) and not a part of the AVP mythos which breaks this tradition.

Effects are truly spectacular this time around; not that the earlier entries ever had much to complain about, it was nice to see Predators that didn't rely simply on their high-tech weaponry as a means of eliminating their prey.  Sure the shoulder-mount plasma guns are back as are the twin forearm razors but spears, whips, and boomerang-like fist-blades don't make an appearance here.  Additionally, and it is yet to be seen whether the community at large will accept this one as part of the mythos, Rodriguez plays around a little bit with the Predator culture by introducing two different sects of Predators that are apparently quite un-fond of one another (quite a diversion from all of the past entries which showed definite camaraderie between the creatures).

And rest easy those who fear this as being the first of the 5 pictures featuring these costumes to fail to up the ""ugly"" factor of the unmasked aliens; the bar is raised once again with the addition of the superior of the two Predator species!

In all, Predators succeeds on many of the fundamental levels of suspense, action, horror and sheer nastiness that has elevated the first film to near legendary status while introducing enough uniqueness to prevent the experience from feeling like a carbon copy.  I was particularly impressed with the explanation presented for alien abduction/ human disappearance here on Earth.  The final homage is that events of the first film are actually referenced in the dialog but, and despite being acknowledged as a legitimate part of the franchise, events of the second film are not mentioned (which obsessed fans may take to mean this film is in fact set some time between 1987 (Predator 1) and 1997 (the setting for Predator 2).

Fans of the original will surely delight in Rodriguez's debut stab at the material and those of us who have found something to enjoy in all of the incarnations thus far will be especially impressed with where he has taken the franchise.",1282521600,,6211,4.838526912181303

I totally loved the idea. It reminds you so much of the original predator with Arnold schwarzenegger. It is packed with action and has lots of great actors and actresses too. I loved how they got Oleg Taktarov, the famous UFC champion, and Morpheos (the guy from the matrix), and all the rest of the tough looking crew in the movie.

The acting in this movie was all great. The CGI wasn't overdone. People who say this is too much like the original are wrong. They have some of the same kind of props, like one of the weapons is the same. But the plot and all of the scenes are totally different. I was very impressed by all of the ""Predator vision"" shots. People who say the Predators where too easy to kill, unlike the one in the original, need to consider that if they where that tough the humans would die in the first twenty minutes, seeing as there are many more Predators in this one. Compare Alien to Aliens. The Aliens where much easier to kill than the one in the first one. But in this one they did things that where different. Like they where willing to sacrifice themselves to kill the Predators. They never caught the Predator in a direct explosion in the original like they did here.

""Predators"" was one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time.  It was more humorous than I expected, with much of the comedic relief provided by Topher Grace and Walton Goggins, and had all the action I could've asked for and more.  What I was surprised at was the amount of tension and suspense built up during the first 45 minutes or so.  Although those of us familiar with the Predator films knew what we were expecting, Predators did a great job of causing us to fear that revealing as much as we were anticipating it.  Very well done all around.  I did think the ending came a bit abruptly, but I am anxiously awaiting a sequel.",1281052800,,807,4.418918918918919
4037399,3,B002ZG98LO,"They should've renamed this sequel to PREADATORS: THE LIP SERVICE TO THE ORIGINAL SEQUEL.  Yeah, this should've been better.  Though, it's not bad, and it's very entertaining, it really brings NOTHING new to the table.  Actually, it pays so much homage and uses so many elements from the first film that it comes off more as fan fiction than a legitimate sequel.

The acting is great in it though.  Adrien Brody is truly a great modern actor who can play anything.  Sure, Predators is way, WAY below his range, but he's never played a character like the one in this film before, a cynical-world weary-mercenary.  He's convincing and totally holds the screen whenever he's around.  AND he's convenient to explain to the rest of the cast what the hell is actually going on in the plot IE explaining it to the audience.  Did anyone else think it was convenient how he kind of caught on to what was actually happening with relative ease?  Alice Braga is in the film and I'm fast becoming a fan of this actress.  She just needs to start picking better characters and better films to be in.  The rest of the cast is negligable cyphers who show up to grimace and then die.  Except Topher Grace.  He adds a sense of humor to the film, that it so much needs.  All the characters that end up on this reserve planet are soldiers or killers of some sort except him.  He's a doctor.  Now if you're mildy retarded or have never seen a film before, ANY FILM, then you might not be able to guess what plot twist he's involved in at the beginning of the third act.  Danny Trejo is underused, which is a crime, but there is a Machete trailer attached to Predators(this film was produced by Machete creator and co-director Robert Rodriguez) so that should help you get your Trejo fill.

The action is paces and choreographed well for each desired effect.  The special effects creatures and CGI are fine, and the designs are interesting.  The pace is zippy and tense.  But the problems of why this film is just elevated to being only SLIGHTLY better than Predator 2 and the first AVP film are as follows:

Why go back to a jungle?  We've seen this already.  Sure, it's an alien planet, but the friggin' jungle looks exactly like....um, Hawaii?  This is already dull.  Why not set it in the old west, ancient Japan, outer space, the far future...SOMETHING NEW.

The convict character was the most edgey and orignal character added to the stock of action movie cliche's, so why not do more with him.  His line about what he's going to do when he gets home, ""Rapin'"", is truly twisted and darkly funny.  This film needed more of this.

Why not touch more on what the Predator aliens culture is?  Sure, we learn that there are different tribes, but it's really only there as a plot device for escaping the planet and isn't really used for anything revolutionary.

Is it me or is it WAY convenient that the Alice Braga character just happened to know the entire plot of the first Predator because she works for the AMerican goverment?  I guess she was out of town or on another mission during Predator 2, because she doesn't mention, or rather, give a really, REALLY long expositional plot synopsis of that film like she does for the first.

As Adrien Brody's character made his way to the spaceship, alone, what did he plan on doing once on board?  He can't fly an alien craft, as far as we're lead to know.  Even if he could, how would he know where to go?  He doesn't even know what galaxy he's in, let alone what the instruments, whatever alien langauge they might be, read as far as direction or the amount of fuel he's got.

This isn't really a complaint but more of an observation: Why did John Debney get credit for scoring this picture?  I didn't hear one original note.  I just figured they took Alan Silvestri's original score from the first two pictures and grafted them where appropriate.

I liked this film.  It was fun and exciting enough.  I just want more.  This is 23 year old franchise.  Take us somewhere new.  This film, with its game reserve planet premise, just has enough to push it over mediocre, but there's so much more.  Why not?  They're noble, tribal, hunting for sport, but super sophisticated technological alien creatures from who know where?  There's better premises to fit these aliens in, but I just don't think there's enough creativity in Hollyweird to must it up.  OR maybe it's just safer to remake with some slight tweaks the original film.  No one gets scared by any sort of ORIGINAL direction, and they feel nice and safe and ready to veg' out.  That's fine, but I'm officially done with this franchise until they start to think out of the box.

This film was directed by Nimrod Antal(the superior horror film Vacancy and the abysmal actioner Armored) and he has a good sense of action.  He doesn't have the stylistic signature of the original Predator's director John Mctiernan(Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October), but he at least knows that geography is important when setting up big action cluster-f&**ks.  He wrings genuine suspense from the set up and displays a flair for action.  There's modern editing of fast cuts, but random CU to ECU shots cut together like a music video are noteably and commendably abscent.  Taking notes Michael Bay? Yeah, didn't think so, you're friggin' rich, and you still don't know how to tell a story.  Whatever.  Antal has a great film in him I think, but it's not this.  How could it be?  This is a sequel to a film that came out over twenty years ago!

PS: The new to this franchise creature team of KNB Effects is AWESOME.  They've made the most effective Predators yet, old and new.  And the vagina visaged monsters are the real reason I go to see these films anyway.",1280188800,6,5727,4.557409224730128
4037400,4,B002ZG98LO,"Though directed by Nimrd Antal (""Vacancy""), the latest addition to the ""Predator"" franchise is clearly inspired or influenced by someone else - someone with creative power, I mean, the hectic, tongue-in-cheek style of producer Robert Rodriguez. Based on the old-fashioned concept of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" the 2010 ""Predators"" is an unabashed action movie that opens with a man free-falling from the sky.

We know nothing about the hapless character Adrien Brody plays, or the place where he is, or other characters he soon encounters on the ground - a group, mostly warriors of some sort, also includes a doctor (Topher Grace), a death row inmate (Walton Goggins) and a Japanese yakuza gangster clad in suit (Louis Ozawa Changchien) - but most viewers already know they are there. Deep in the jungle, they are ""being hunted"" by the invisibly cloaked aliens, the Predators.

While the film doesn't break new ground and the story involving the hunters and the hunted is often too silly with some incredible turns of events, ""The Predators"" is a pretty entertaining film with a series of average action sequences. It is a standard Hollywood action movie with an ethnically diverse cast including one female sniper (Alice Braga). I think most viewers can predict who will survive and who will not.

Had this installment been directed by Rodriguez himself, things might have been a bit different. Perhaps Danny Trejo's role would have been much bigger and more importantly, the film would have been less formulaic.

All the action looked real. All of the Predators (and other monsters) looked real. All of the acting is really good. Although I must say that I had a hard time swallowing Adrian Brody as the lead tough guy. Brody comes across as more of a softy to me. If I had to seek out a complaint it might be that Brody was a bit miscast, but not so much so that it took away from the thoroughly entertaining experience that I had with Predators.

The story is very similar to the first one. A group of mostly soldiers (or soldier types) are in a mysterious jungle and soon realize that there's a role reversal going on: they are no longer hunters, mercenaries or whatever; they are the hunted. And they are going to need a lot of firepower and strategy in order to walk away alive from the situation that they are in.

I guess if I had to ""unEarth"" another negative it would be that the storyline is quite familiar. But Antal and Rodriguez introduce enough new concepts and twists to keep this sequel pretty fresh looking and not as predictable as you may think. If you were a big fan of the 1987 cult classic like I was, I believe that you'll find that this 2010 reintroduction to the Predators will be a welcome one...like it was for me.

A few words of caution to anyone that saw my comment about bringing the kids to this movie: it is not a family film. It earns its R rating.

4037403,4,B002ZG98LO,"It's been twenty years since ""Predator 2"" showcased the monstrous hunter in a solo capacity. Finally, after all that time 20th Century Fox brings the hunters back to theaters with the recently released sci-fi action film, ""Predators"".

""Predators"" follows a group of Earth's deadliest killers, led by a mysterious mercenary (Adrien Brody), who find themselves trapped on a strange world. As the group tries to find a way off the planet, they soon discover that they have been placed on this world for a reason...to be hunted. Now, they are locked in a deadly fight for survival with beings far deadlier than anything they've ever encountered.

You know, there's something about this series that's bothered me for quite some time now. It's nothing regarding the previous two films in the franchise, both of which were quite good in my opinion. No, what bothers me is why would 20th Century Fox, who owns the rights to the character, leave the series effectively dead for so long?

Sure the character appeared in the hit ""versus"" movie, ""Alien Vs Predator"" and its extremely disappointing sequel ""Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem"". But as a stand alone property the character proved successful, and the movies were extremely entertaining and profitable to boot. So, it's beyond me why the decision was made to shelve the property for such an extended period. Especially when so many countless sub-par horror franchises are allowed to exist long past their welcome. Anyways, I digress...

In charge of crafting a story that would serve as a hard-hitting return to the big screen for the character worthy of the original is screenwriter/director/producer Robert Rodriguez (""Sin City""). Robert's story brings the action back to a jungle atmosphere (albeit on another planet) harkening back to the first film, but ups the ante in every respect. The story is chock full of incredibly entertaining action set pieces, with a break-neck pacing to keep the momentum running full steam ahead from start to finish; however, if you're coming to this movie looking for in-depth character study, look somewhere else.

Now, that shouldn't come as any surprise to fans of the series, this franchise has never been about character development or engaging drama. It's always been about the hunt, and those who are unfortunate enough to become the hunted. I'm sure that some people (mostly critics that look down their noses at these types of movies) will view the lack of character driven drama as a weakness; if you ask me, the reason these movies work is because they never try to over complicate the situation. It's a monster movie plain and simple, and what the audience wants is to see great visual effects, incredible action, and some entertaining chase and/or fight sequences between the hunter and the hunted. In this, ""Predators"" absolutely nails it, and hopefully brings the series back into popularity.

On an interesting side note, Robert Rodriguez actually wrote the original script for this film prior to finishing up work on his first breakthrough hit ""Desperado"" in 1995. However, upon completion 20th Century Fox opted not to move forward with another sequel and shelved the project. I don't know if any of you out there really cared to know that tidbit of information, but I just wanted to throw it out there anyway. Moving on.

Assisting Robert in reinvigorating the franchise was the film's director Nimrod Antal. I wasn't sure how Nimrod would be as director for this long-awaited follow-up. I mean his previous directorial effort ""Armored"" was a decent enough action flick. Yet, it never really felt like it was anything great compared to any number of action movies I could find from Direct-to-DVD releases featuring the action heroes of yesteryear.

However, after seeing how Nimrod Antal handled ""Predators"" I have to say that he was undoubtedly the right man for the job. After all, he delivered a pulse-pounding thrill ride that blew his previous film out of the water with considerable ease. Not to mention, the previews didn't ruin every single plot point for this film, a problem that plagued ""Armored"" and probably led to my less than thrilled perception of the movie.

Leading the ensemble cast, and is probably the most surprising bit of casting I have seen for a movie in quite some time, is Academy Award winner Adrien Brody (""King Kong""). When his casting was first announced, I was a little leery, as I'm sure many fans were, because Adrien didn't exactly look the part of a man that the Predator would find a challenging prey. Yet the more I read about how the idea was to distance this entry in some respects from what's come before by not going with a muscle-bound warrior, but instead utilize a more cerebral character, the more I became intrigued by the possibility he presented.

In the end, a somewhat bulked-up Adrien Brody created a believable adversary for the Predators. He blended together elements of Arnold's no-nonsense qualities with those of a keenly intelligent, semi-manipulative, world-weary individual that will do whatever it takes to survive.

Portraying some of the other collected prey for the titular characters are Topher Grace, Alice Braga, and Walton Goggins. As I stated earlier the story wasn't one that really challenged any member of the cast dramatically, granted that was never the intention. That being said, the cast didn't just slack off and phone in their performances either.

Topher Grace (""Spider-Man 3"") played the kind of character that always seems to suit him perfectly, that of a sniveling weasel of a man, who always feels more important than he really is. Alice Braga (""Repo Men"") as a tough-as-nails soldier was surprisingly believable in the role and helped to balance out the extreme machismo of Adrien Brody's character and most of the other cast members. Then there's actor Walton Goggins (TV's ""Justified"") as a convict that sets out as only being interested in self-preservation, but eventually becomes somewhat of a team player. As I said, none of them really had to stretch to flesh out their characters, but they all did well in the roles and sold them to the audience convincingly.

Making slightly extended cameo appearances in the film were actors Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo. Laurence was very entertaining for the brief time he was in the film as a soldier that has snapped with reality after being marooned on this planet for quite some time. Danny Trejo wasn't given a whole lot more to do in the movie than Laurence, and his role felt as if it had just been shoe-horned in to the film. This was a real shame, because Danny always delivers an interesting character every time he appears in a movie. This time though, his appearance was most likely due to the fact that he has acted in virtually every single movie Robert Rodriguez has worked on since ""Desperado"", so this one should be no exception. Thus, his character felt like an afterthought.

Well, after waiting so long for a third installment, it's nice to see that the ""Predator"" franchise hasn't lost its edge. Combining some of the best elements of the previous two films, taking the hunt off-world, plus some terrific action scenes and visual effects, makes ""Predators"" the triumphant return to cinema's that this series deserves.

""Predators"" is rated R for violence and language.",1279929600,8,7327,4.989352989352989
4037464,4,B002ZG98LO,"PREDATORS

It has been a long time since an actual Predator movie as been made and I have to say that I am truly happy another did indeed come along. Sure we had two AVP films come out but those were not straight Predator films, and to be honest those had the potential to be so much more. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate any of them but they could have been better. So when I heard Robert Rodriguez was involved with the next Predator film I was extremely excited. I found out later he was just producing the film based on a story he wrote many years ago, still I knew it would be good.

So when the film finally was released in theaters we all gathered up and went to see it, by we I mean me, my girl, my bro, and one of my best friends. We waited a week or so after the opening release due to so other things going on but still we made it to the movies. So we got there 30 minutes early or so as to get good seats and declined buying any drinks. We didn't get any drinks because it was apparent that these fountain drinks were imported from only the finest of lands, squeezed from the supple [well they were just insanely expensive, principle alone forbid me from tasting it's sweet sugary taste]. So we made our way into the last door on the left to watch what we knew would be great.

If you do not know by now the film starts with people free falling and waking up doing so having no memory of how they got there. After making their way to the ground, some harder than others, they do not know who to trust. But the overwhelming sense that something is very wrong leads them to form an uneasy alliance with each other, if only for the moment. There is about eight of them and each coming from a different area, country, and background, or so it seems. It may turn out to be that all of these people are more alike than they think. How so you may ask, well it is because all of them are killers, or should we say predators back where they come from. The best of the best when it comes to killing on Planet Earth, well all but one it seems. And speaking of Planet Erath we may or may not be on our own planet as we take this ride with these people.

Still the title says it all and even a person who is not a fan of these films knows that the movie is about an alien creature who is the ultimate hunter. A creature so deadly not even Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura could survive when pitted against it; sure some have defeated it but look at that statement. Some have defeated it, as in a predator but who can survive multiple of the greatest killer known to the universe. Even more threatening is that we learn the Predator we have always feared is actually the smaller of two different species of the creature, YIKES. But it is all a game in this film and I mean that in the sense that we are the game, along with various other creatures from different worlds. It also seems that these monsters have been doing this forever, so let the games begin.

The people in this film are what some would say clich characters, the military guys, the mercenaries, the yakuza guy and such. The thing is these people actually do exist and whether the script could fully develop them or not is were the problem is. Writers Michael Finch and Alex Litvak in my opinion kept the film on the right path along with director Nimrd Antal moving it along. Sure the characters could have been developed more but hey this is a Predator movie after all, aren't we here to see people get hunted and then slaughtered. So I can forgive any shortcoming the script may have had, I mean come on I have been waiting for a Predator film since the second one.

As far as our actors go I must say from the jump I was extremely excited to see MMA legend Oleg Taktarov in this film. And just like I thought he did an amazing job here, I mean who better to take on a Predator. Adrien Brody is our lead here and pulls the role off well and in my eyes was very believable in the role, even beefed up a little bit. Topher Grace was a surprise here and much like his character seemed out of place, but let me assure you he does an excellent job in this film. Alice Braga is our only female here and she does not disappoint, even showing up the boys in this film at times. I mean her character does, all of the performances are great. Walton Goggins is a scene stealer for sure and gives the film a little more comedic moments. Danny Trejo is here as well although it would have been cool to see him get more time on screen. Louis Ozawa Changchien is great as the Yakuza character in this film, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali is great and menacing looking in this, and of course the surprise of the film Laurence Fishburne all give great performances as well.

I should also note that there are three other actors in this film Derek Mears playing our classic Predator, Carey Jones as the tracker Predator, and Brian Steele as the berserker predator. Now with that out the way I can say that the film really does pay respect to the other Predator films and does not make them look weak like the first AVP did. One moment I particularly love involves the Yakuza character up against a Predator one on one. Now I mention this because some people have been saying a Predator would not have a blade battle with a person, they would just kill them and move on. I have to disagree with that on all fronts; I know a Predator would do hand to hand, blade to blade, or gun to gun with a singular opponent. We have to remember that Predators or prideful in their hunting skills and their ability to defeat any prey in any form of combat. Let me just say that this part of the film is one of my favorites.

Now like I said before there are some flaws and that is mostly with the script but you can over look them just by looking at the great lay out of the new planet, especially when they realize they are not on Earth, that shot is amazing. Also the new creatures that we get a peek at in this film are great, such as the dog like creatures the Predators use in this film. The film really is an entertaining ride from start to finish and shows the potential the new Predators films have if the continue with a sequel. The film was a great way to spend that night and I did not feel bad about paying for every one to go see it. I thought the movie was worth the money I spent, to me there is nothing better than watching a movie with your closest friends around you. It not only adds to the atmosphere in the room but it makes the viewing experience a little more fun.",1279670400,3,6506,4.1702466189339695

The movie starts with action!

A man is falling from a great height, apparently some high-tech pack on his back that will not open despite his grunts and yells to do so. As the green land becomes clear trees, the future is looking more like a red splotch on the swampy land below, when it opens suddenly.

He lands, not sure where or what is going on, when he meets a murdering Latin with twin machine guns in his hands.

Several F-Bombs later and meeting a few more of the ragtag group, they soon discover that they're no longer on Earth.  The painting as it clears the sky is so realistic and the depth of despair is palpable as the group of murders, thieves and rapists realize the fix they're in.

The Predators are alien hunters who use humans and other species as prey to further hone their skills as hunters.  They consider it a step in evolution to adapt to their prey and go in for the kill.  Armed with energy weapons and blue crackling personal force fields, they give their prey guns and let them have at it.

It was great seeing how a group of murderers and rapists form an uneasy alliance.  The doctor, the one most unlikely a murderer or rapist as you can get, has secrets of his own which are revealed near the end of the film.  His depravity is the worst of all!

The group gets flushed out into the open by ""dogs"" that can take bullets to the head and need a full clip pumped into them before they even slow down.  Tough little buggers.

When they meet a guy who as been on the planet a long time and he leads them to an alien machine where he's holed up, the action slows a bit but that's fine.  We finally get some explanation of what's going on.

Honor:

The alien predators have their own sense of honor.  They mark their trophies with the dead of their prey.  They also have an in-fighting going on between two predator species, a fact that some of the human 'predators' try to take advantage of.

Action!

There's lots of it here.  The Japanese samurai sword fight with a very big Predator was a sight to see and quite unpredictable in its ending.  The human instinct for survival comes up with some pretty unusual and creative ways to put these Predators away -- some that nearly get a human or two killed.

Finally, the direction takes us in a predictable direction, then suddenly changes to unpredictability.  The director does this several times, keeping the CGI to a minimum and the action and brutality to a maximum.  This ain't no Disney film, friends!

Spine-ripping, blood drenching (both red and green) brutality is the watchword in this film so be warned.

Welcome sequel to the Predator series of films, much superior to the earlier ones.

Directed by Nimrod Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez, the film stars Adrien Brody as Royce, a mercenary who leads a group of elite warriors (including Laurence Fishburne and Alice Braga), co-starring Topher Grace.

4037466,5,B002ZG98LO,"A very good entertaining solid action film. You knew with Robert Rodriguez and a very capable director Nimrod Antal, you knew this be good. The plot and story is pretty thin but then again so was the plot of the original Predator film.

The good thing about the film starting off is that obviously you don't need to have watched the first film to watch this. Originally Robert and Nimrod said this was a ""sequel"". It doesn't quite fit the bill as a sequel as it only briefly mentions the events of the first film and that's about it, but that don't matter.

So anyways, the plot of the film about a group of selected ""participants"" who arrive on a planet inhabited by the Predators works well largely to the great cast, tension, slow buildup, and eventually the action scenes that we come to expect.

The script is good enough to give us a taste of every character though some characters stick out more than others obviously.

Adrian Brody has the lead as the mercenary ""Royce"" while Alice Braga is a nice supporting character in Isabella. Rounding out the cast is Topher Grace as a doctor who doesn't quite belong here with the other targets. Walton Goggins, Laurence Fishburne, Danny Trejo, Oleg Taktaro all have nice parts in the film.

I think the character development is good enough. I mean this obviously supposed to a survival horror type of action film, so we weren't going to get a lot, but you know they picked the characters to expand and the ones that they did expand were good choices such as Fishburne's Noland character. He doesn't have a big part, but gives you the idea of what's it like to be a survivor among the Predators. Adrian has a big enough part obviously as the lead to portray part of his hired gun persona.

I liked the slow buildup, Nimrod and the writers for the film don't show off the Predators right of the bat instead have us gradually becoming aware of the presence as the targets are knocked off.  Then from there the action scenes and tension are pulled really well, and the cast for the film is perfect.

Then once the action is halted, Robert and Nimrod know when to take a break, and then the characters cope with the situation.

This was a very well polished action movie.

There were a couple of big names and some other names that while they be recognized ""big"" actors are all actors with a lot experience.

The script also has a lot of memorable scenes and quotes like Laurence's ""You talk to loud"", and ""I am the one that got away, the one you **beep** with"".

Some people mentioned they were afraid about the casting, and some of the choices. For me, I didn't Adrian could pull of the lead, but after reading interviews with him from the directors and how he wanted the role.

All in all a great film for Predator fans.",1279324800,2,2767,4.47713717693837
4037467,3,B002ZG98LO,"A tough group of humans find themselves on another planet run by the alien skull hunters we like to call Predators. The movie is way better than the AVP movies, but it's still nothing more than just a good popcorn flick. While Adrien Brody is surprisingly bad ass despite his Clint Eastwood like voice being kind of laughable.

  But the movie could have been more since Robert Rodriguez wrote the script. You can tell he's a fan, you got the same musical score and a lot of the movie is a little similar to the first film. By watching the trailers where Rodriguez introduces the characters, you can also tell that he had fun creating them.

  None of the characters are developed that great though. We learn about the characters when they talk about how tough they are and what they can do but with most of them we don't actually get to see what they can do. From those trailers, I think Rodriguez was most excited about Topher Grace's character being more than he seemed. So I expected some great secret about his character but it turns out to not be anything too special or unpredictable.

  Laurence Fishburne was the most wasted though as a mysterious guy that has survived amongst the Predators by wearing their invisibility gear. That may sound cool, but he doesn't get enough screen time when I was the most interested in seeing his character get some action. While the ending didn't leave me with much, it might as well have just said ""To Be Continued"", but I don't think anyone will care if it does continue even though the movie wasn't bad.",1279065600,9,1551,4.5503597122302155
4037468,4,B002ZG98LO,"This was a very decent sequel to the original 1987 film. It reminded me a lot of a story called 'The Most Dangerous Game' but it's on the planet of the Predators. Soldiers, drug dealers, a convict, and a doctor are all brought to another planet and are being hunted down by the Predators. They don't trust each other at first, but they soon must work together to survive. The Predators have a new look, and they're tougher and badder than ever. Not only must they deal with the Predators, they must deal with booby-traps, dog-like alien creatures, and a deranged Soldier named Noland.

4037469,4,B002ZG98LO,"As any horror sci-fi movie fan let it be known that I love Predator. Its an absolute guy movie that got a simplistic sequel and in one of the worst ideas ever a teamup with another iconic movie creature. That said Predators is a fan service movie at the most, and a slick reworking of the franchise using The Most Dangerous Game as the idea of a backdrop. Thankfully its not a terrible movie- its better than Predator 2, but it has a few problems keeping it from being the amazing must see movie of the summer.
I'll start with the bad in saying that truthfully I could have done without the fan service, little homages sprinkled throughout meant to make the fanboy's go crazy in recognition. Adrien Brody mudded up shouting for a Predator to kill him, not one but two Billy scenes, or an odd tumble off a cliff over a waterfall. To me these scenes were more groan worthy than anything else and would have been better cut from the script (excluding I suppose a familiar song that plays over the end credits). Add to that a character overacted by Laurence Fishburne, and the fact that however buff He may get and however gruff He can make his voice I still couldn't consider Adrien Brody as an action hero.
That said everything else worked for me. Nimrod Antal is a director I've been waiting to have a breakout movie. While this doesn't come close to matching the brilliance of his debut it draws on his strengths to be better than his Hollywood output in Vacancy and the boring Armored.  The movie draws on his ability I think to find some absoultely alien enviroments mixing scenery from Texas and Hawaii to regular studio scenes. Action scenes work at points and really the movie moves at a nice clip even though it doesn't really take off until the Predators actually come into play.
I was speaking about the action. Its definitely designed rather well in places. The final showdown is well done and executed as an idea on how Brody can take on a Predator in hand to hand. But being a Japanese samurai movie fan the showdown between the three fingered Yakuza and a Predator with its wide angles and blowing grass was the best homage possible in my opinion.
Acting wise most of it ranks from good to okay. I like Louis Ozawa Changiens mystical Yakuza who gets the final Billy standoff. Topher Grace makes a good showing as weak Edwin, a character nobody can figure out till the end. But by far the best character is Walton Goggins Stans, a death row inmate played for comedic relief who did get some good laughs and one of the best death scenes. After this, The Shield and Justified, Goggins will get a lot more respect from me.
In the end Predators is a good movie with problems. It might now work for everyone but I had a good time watching itt",1278979200,2,2748,4.463220675944334

4037471,4,B002ZG98LO,"I'm happy to say that Predators is the sequel we've been waiting 23 years to see. I watched Predator 2 on Blu-ray the other night and while I think it's underrated by many, even I can't call it a worthy follow-up to the 1987 classic. Predators has more than it's share of copycat moments. The familiar jungle setting, dialogue (""over here""), music, and even though it's missing that creepy vibe of the original, it's all kinds of fun to watch, especially if you're a fan of the series. Let's just forget those two Alien vs. Predator movies were ever made.

Like the original, the team battling the Predators is small enough in size so you get to know them a little bit along the way, but they lack some of the simple charms. The acting may even be better this time around, but it's hard to beat two future governors and Apollo Creed fighting a 7 foot alien. Adrien Brody is one of the last people I would ever think of being an action hero, but he bulked up, put on his best Christian Bale era Batman voice, and pulled it off pretty darn well. Laurence Fishburne isn't in the film as much as the trailers would make you believe, but I liked the weirdness he brought to the role. There wasn't one cast member I hated, so that's always a plus, but I did feel the whole Topher Grace thing was too obvious. I also wish they got more use out of Danny ""Machete"" Trejo.

We now learn that the Predators themselves are broken down into two classes. The smaller ones we've seen before and look almost identical to the original predator, but the larger ones have a slightly different looking face and one huge lower jaw. At first I was not that crazy about having these different races of Preds fighting each other, as well as, the humans, but the idea grew on me. The creatures themselves look good, but they come across more bulky than agile, especially during the hand to hand fight scenes. At times I thought I was watching the WWE galactic edition.

The CGI is good 90% of the time (still not sure about those alien dogs) and unlike Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, you can actually see what's going on in the action sequences. The gore level is average. It would have been nice to see some more creative kills from various Predator weapons, instead of just the wrist blades and shoulder cannons.

I still wish Robert Rodriguez would have not only produced, but directed, like he initially planned, but Nimrd Antal gives us a film worthy enough to sit beside Predator on my DVD shelf. Now bring on the sequels or I'll really hate that open ending.",1278720000,2,2539,4.4655172413793105
4037472,5,B002ZG98LO,"""Predators"" is a worthy follow-up to the 1987 Schwarzenneger original. In fact, this could be the best movie in the Alien/Predator series since then.

""Predators"" returns the action to the jungle, only we're not on Earth anymore. A group of proven soldiers, all from different nationalities and backgrounds, find themselves dropped onto this alien planet, the Predator homeworld. Together, they have to fight their way out.

The characters are all likable, especially the heroic Russian agent Nikolai and the crazy-yet-funny convict, Stans. Adrien Brody is also convincing as a seasoned soldier, and he certainly worked out enough to dismiss anyone who said he wasn't physically right for the role.

Other stand-outs are the compassionate but deadly Isabelle and the panicky doctor, Edwin, as well as the silently lethal Yakuza member, Hanzo, who faces a Predator one-on-one. Laurence Fishburne may be the most impressive in his role as Nolan, an eccentric scavenger who's survived on the planet for ""10 seasons"".

Another strong point is that most of the music in the movie was based on the score from the first Predator, which was one of the reasons that movie was so memorable.

This is a sequel that Predator fans should go crazy for. It's got the badass action and characters, memorable lines, epic action sequences, TWO bloody final battles. It's the type of R-Rated action movie that hasn't been seen much lately, and if you're a Predator fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this.",1278720000,5,1488,5.057142857142857
4037473,4,B002ZG98LO,"Of all the Predator themed films that have been made since the original, most have simply either placed them in new suroundings or have expanded on the ever growing mythos of their savage hunting culture. But with PREDATORS, director Anwar Nidal takes them back to their roots.  In the first film, Schwartzenegger battled the solo Predator in a manner that clearly delineated the gap between the fighting skills of humanity's best and those of an alien breed.  What Arnold taught us is that these intergalactic trophy hunters were fierce fighters indeed but were singularly lacking in that immortal spark that we call inspiration.  In PREDATORS, Adrien Brody takes up where Arnold left off.  Both films begin on a similar note. A group of experienced combat veterans, hit men, and assorted human predators gather in a jungle setting to square off against a trio of totally vicious aliens who prize trophy heads even over their own lives.  How these human killers arrive is of no consequence.  The film does little more than simply to have them literally fall out of the sky.  As they land, they meet, they squabble but quickly realize that their only collective chance to survive is to co-operate.  Most of them are dramatic straw men, designed only to show one particular type of human being. Their is Alice Braga, a butt kicking woman assassin who takes an instant distrust to Brody.  There is Danny Trejo, a Columbian Medelin hit man. Most of the other actors are unknown, except for a brief appearance midway by Lawrence Fishburne who suggests that his own interaction with the beasties implies that the millennia long history of humanity is intertwined with that of the Predators.  In the original PREDATOR as with this one, the function of this race of head hunters is to point out that they exist on some deep primordial level as the avatars of humanity's need to have a devil figure to function as a pure metaphor of our own need dominate others. And domination requires proof as such.  With Predators, this proof is akin to our own lamentable custom of taking scalps, in this case skulls.  PREDATORS is an action film that nevertheless succeeds in suggesting that there is no basic difference between the human version of headhunters and the alien, except that even in the most degenerate of humans, there yet exists a spark of humanity and co-operation that sets us off from them.  We may take the screaming heads of our own victims as do they but we can question the need to do so.  They, on the other hand, live for these trophies. PREDATORS permits the audience to enjoy a thrill a minute ride while simultaneously suggesting that this thrill need not define us as a species.",1278720000,4,2688,4.79004329004329

8385049,3,B002ZG98LO,"This is a cheesy movie that introduces foolish characters (i.e. the animals that the Predators have) and starts off with a very confusing scene in which Adrien Brody is falling from the sky. What planet is this? At first, it seems it's Earth, but we later see it's not, as evidenced by the massive moons in the sky. Add Danny Trejo's character (the token character in Robert Rodriguez's movies) and no explanation of who or what dropped these characters onto this planet, and you have a mundane recipe for a mediocre Predators movie that pales in comparison to the original Predator film and the Alien vs. Predator franchise.
However... there were several elements of this movie that made it a cut above the original Predator film and the Alien vs. Predator franchise. First, there's a surprise appearance by Laurence Fishburne who dons a Predator mask along with the vade mecum cloaking capability. This was unexpected, but a welcome addition. Second, the concept of predators (criminals, gang members, mercenaries, etc.) being hunted by Predators is interesting and brilliant (though the writers did not sufficiently explain in detail about this). Third, having a new breed of Predators was another unexpected but interesting concept.
The latter scenes of this movie copy scenes and dialogue from the original Predator movie, and for that this movie shines but ultimately flounders.
Would I recommend this movie? Meh.",1527206400,,1419,5.147186147186147
