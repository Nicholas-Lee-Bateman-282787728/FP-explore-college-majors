4852128,5,B005OGYH9A,"I saw this last night at the theater, and I can't recommend it enough.  It has leaped over Ladies and Gentlemen...the Rolling Stones as my favorite Stones concert movie.  For one thing, this one was all filmed during one 1978 concert, so you don't get those pesky costume changes that hamper the earlier film (although the performances in that one are great as well).  The band plays great in this film, but Mick absolutely steals the show with his intense and focused yet playful performance.  Hard to imagine him being any better than he is in this one.  Highly recommended.",1318982400,10,576,4.72
4852129,5,B005OGYH9A,"Just saw this in the theatre and it is superb. This is the Stones coming off the matt and fighting for their title -- and we all know which title I'm talking 'bout. Five original Stones (Ian Stewart included) plus two former Faces, Keith and Charlie actually looking young, Mick moving into his camp phase with Ronnie as his primary foil. Tremendous. I can't believe they'd ever play any better than this. I'd love to hear this on CD (not the bootleg), and I'm definitely preordering.",1318896000,9,484,4.6395348837209305

4852131,5,B005OGYH9A,"It seems that the Stones are agreeing to document in High Def, all major filmed landmark gigs of their amazing career.  I suspect this is not just for the money (and yet how that cash must roll in) No.. They are now at a late career stage where there is a need to ensure that their posterity is well preserved. The Stones have nothing after all like the Beatles definitive Anthology. The  25x5 documentary of a quarter century ago is only half of their career to date! I ramble...

This is a great concert. Apart from the great performance musically, you get most of the ""Some Girls"" album live on stage. Eight numbers from it I counted!
 Shattered, Beast of Burden and especially When the whip comes down, are all first rate.
Pity it wasn't filmed in 35 mm as these 16 mm films even when cleaned up to HD still have a ""misty"" look comparitively. However, it is of its time and we must savour it. On the cinema showing on Oct 4th here in England, I was amazed at how well Bill Wymans bass was put at the front of the soundmix. Thank you Mr Clearmountain, you have shown how fundamental his basslines were to the Stones.

Enjoy this gig folks and I hope the blu ray is as good as the cinema release.  Roll on further filmed gigs in blu ray. Lets have Paris Aux Abattoirs 76, Hampton Roads 81 and maybe Marquee London 71 if this could scrub up well enough from the old Lion TV tapes. Ged",1317859200,93,1385,4.267175572519084

4852134,5,B005OGYH9A,"Watching this performance from the Rolling Stones' 1978 tour in support of the ""Some Girls"" album, it's hard to believe that you're seeing and hearing the same band which, just a couple of years earlier, appeared to be teetering on the brink of collapse. But some of punk's youthful vigor had rubbed off on the old Stones machine and, with both the record and the tour, they managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (at least for the time being). There's a *lot* of material from ""Some Girls""--maybe too much--but it's played with tons of energy, and you can tell that the band is having fun. All the hit singles ('Miss You', 'Beast of Burden', 'Shattered') are here, as well as a gleefully furious version of 'When the Whip Comes Down', to which Jagger (whose heart really seems to be in the song) adds an extra verse. Most of the '60s standards had been retired by this point, but the set retains a marvelous rendition of Robert Johnson's slow blues 'Love in Vain' as well as two Chuck Berry numbers (including 'Sweet Little Sixteen', which the Stones hadn't played since 1963). After a refreshingly spartan 'Brown Sugar', the eighty-minute show ends with a breakneck, almost metallic 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'; the Fort Worth audience is ecstatic, and rightly so since it has just witnessed rock 'n' roll in its purest form.
The DVD also includes the band's scrappy performance, later that same year, on ""Saturday Night Live"" (Jagger has a sore throat), and you get a CD of the entire Fort Worth concert. An absolute must for Stones fans, of course, but the casual observer will enjoy this release, too.",1479081600,9,1610,4.733096085409253

4852177,5,B005OGYH9A,"this double disc collection had the Blu-ray video with awesome sound, and a CD of equally superb quality. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed the video of this concert. It came across as a back to basics performance with apparently eight of the 17 songs performed coming from the some girls studio album. The video concert time is one hour and 23 minutes, and the CD is one hour and 20 minutes: the three minutes difference is basically some purely visual elements taken out in the remixing/remastering comes across as masterful. In the credits it indicates that the video had been cleaned up and extensively processed; since I have not seen the original footage, I have nothing to compare it with, so I don't know how much of an improvement it is. The Blu-ray bonuses have an interview from 2011 with Mick Jagger and it explains a lot of context for the way Mick was dressed and also for the way songs were selected . The Saturday Night Live excerpt is excellent with versions of beast of burden, respectable, and shattered that come across in an extremely good and clear way. The final extra is a very brief interview with the stones from ABC news and it has a couple of video clips that are very nice.
  The studio version of some of the SOME GIRLS studio album has some great bass playing, which I presume is Bill Wyman. Playing the Blu-ray and the CD on 5.1 sound systems gives a very clear perception of the overall mix, and the bass (which in bills case I must admit to being partial to) comes across fairly well if you turn it up a little bit: essentially the bass is not overdone, it's not underdone, it is just very clear. Charlie Watts plays brilliantly as always. Bill Wyman lays down the laconic bass as only he can. The interplay between Ron Wood and Keith Richards is basically brilliant. The nice thing about the mix of songs is that they picked some old blues, classic rock, and of course a great selection of their own material. This is a concert for a smaller venue, and in that respect it is very intimate, and the video captures that element of the performance. If you listen to the 2011 interview, you can understand the reasons why the Rolling Stones did what they did in this smaller venue. I took it for what it was, had no preconceptions and was happily relieved by the quality of the concert and of the CD. Recommended for any fans of the stones.",1391299200,,2369,4.494199535962877
4852178,5,B005OGYH9A,I was lucky enough to see this tour on Mick Jagger's birthday. This concert film captures the magic of the Some Girls Tour.

4852181,5,B005OGYH9A,"I saw the Rolling Stones in Detroit during this 1978 tour.  Mick and company were at the top of their game during this time and this concert video shows the Stones exuding the raw, energetic power that is rock and roll at it's finest.  Mick and company chose smaller venues (auditoriums, rather than stadiums) for most if not all of this tour, in an apparent attempt to return to their roots. I like seeing any band in this type of setting.  Acoustics are better and everyone has a good or decent view of the band.  The Stones are known as ""the greatest rock and roll band in the world"" and this concert shows you just why they earned that title.",1385251200,,646,4.358333333333333
4852182,5,B005OGYH9A,"The touring band featured the usual suspects--Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, and Ron Wood. Assisting them--the redoubtable Ian Stewart, Ian McLagan, and Doug Kershaw. The tour was in support of their new album, ""Some Girls."" It featured many songs from the album, but also featured other songs from earlier. And, boy, do the Stones look young!

The concert depicted here begins with ""Let It Rock"" and ends with ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" with many songs in between. A few words about some of the songs: ""Let It Rock."" Good old-fashioned rock and roll, good guitar work by Richards and Wood. ""All Down the Line"": A little rough, but good rock and roll. ""Honky Tonk Women"": As raunchy as ever. Well done. ""Star Star"": The words would offend many, but the band seems to enjoy playing this. The reference to Steve McQueen always brings a smile! The rhythm section is rock solid, with Wyman and Watts doing well.

""When the Whip Comes Down"": Mick Jagger plays a bit of guitar here, but it is Wood's and Richards' riffing that makes the song. ""Miss You"": An energetic version. ""Imagination"": I think that this old Temptations' song represents one of their better covers of the work of others. There is a wistful tone to the song and the band plays well. ""Shattered"": I like to think of this song in juxtaposition with ""Hot Stuff."" ""Shattered"" is a cool tune! Then, the classic blues song, ""Love in Vain."" Played well as blues. ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"": One of the best rock riffs starts this off. The band plays energetically and Jagger swaggers through the song.

A fine concert album!",1384646400,5,1596,4.77536231884058

4852188,5,B005OGYH9A,"Let's get the obvious out of the way first- this is one of the two or three most essential video documents ever released on the Stones. Just fabulous, the Stones as tight and hot as they'd ever be, touring in support of one of their greatest albums, recorded in a relatively intimate setting, with excellent straightforward cinematography and sound. Just get it! and stop wasting time reading about it already.

  Now can we speak frankly? Jagger's rubbery pants are apparently custom tailored to emphasize his-uh ""package"" to an hilarious extent, is it live or is it silicone? Jagger in his jester mood may have decided to steal a page from Spinal Tap, who knows? Anyways he seems very ""glad"" to see the audience or that's got a bag of jellyfish in his pocket!

  Two little bits you may miss on the first viewing(and you will be watching this compulsively trust me)is Jagger taking liberties with the lyrics to Sweet Little Sixteen (""tight dresses and tampax""? don't think that was Chuck's original words)and him asking something of the audience like ""You getting horny?"" before Brown Sugar. Hell YES! For more concert dvds this incandescent.",1369612800,,1144,4.901554404145077
4852189,4,B005OGYH9A,"A must for Stones fans.  For some, 1978 was the last time they mattered even a little bit.  I've liked some stuff they have done since, but to see this band promote Some Girls in a relatively small hall in Forth Worth (I mostly hate stadium shows, however democratic they might be), as presented in the DVD half of this 2-disc set, is a refreshing look back at a band on stage, playing rock and roll, presenting some new material and playing some covers and classics ... with no special effects.  That's essentially all this is, the pretty decent extras notwithstanding.  And that's a good thing.  Pretty quaint this day and age ...

I passed on a chance to see them on the 1978 tour, and I'm now sorry I didn't get to see them live then.  I had seen the bloated 1975 stadium tour and didn't imagine they would be able to refocus and nail a solid rock and roll set in the way that this DVD shows they did.

The year 1978 saw chart domination of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, a career-breakout Springsteen tour, 300,000 fans at California Jam II, and the peculiar proto-social media phenomenon of CB radios, among other things -- and the Stones seemed intent on reasserting their claim to their piece of pop culture turf.

The band plays well, and it's nice to see them supported by Ian Stewart and Ian McLagan, even if the tall and short keyboard players are barely glimpsed in the background.  As others have mentioned, this DVD is a good reminder of how much Ron Wood brought to the band.  Bill Wyman appears to auditioning as an especially good bass-playing Easter Island statue, and Charlie Watts mans the drum kit in a way that we have long taken for granted.  Oh, and the other two were pretty good, too ... a certain lead singer doesn't rush through perfunctory versions of songs to the extent he may have done on subsequent tours.

The audio portion of the concert on CD is a nice complement to the DVD, as well.  Realistically, I'll play the audio more than the DVD over the long run, but the two discs really do complement one another.

Finally, when I saw them in '75, I thought they were old, but as they slog around on tour in 2013, it's funny to see how young they looked in 1978!",1369267200,3,2201,4.426799007444169

4852204,5,B005OGYH9A,"I've probably seen every Stones documentary/movie and this is by far the best. At first you might think it's a bit sloppy but a few songs in and they are just playing with more energy and fire than perhaps any other band. As a young kid I saw the Clash live in Asbury Park, NJ 1982. As performers they had more energy than any band I have ever seen live since. They would have had to open for the Stones on this night. For me Ron Wood has never impressed me more. I used to prefer Mick Taylor but this blows away all the Mick Taylor live footage that I have seen. Charlie Watts crackles throughout, Bill's basslines keep it all from coming off the tracks-who knew how solid he was?, Keith is slashing & stabbing throughout, Vocals are perfect, keys mixed a bit low in the background add texture.  This is better than the 72 tour, even more grit & a relentless hard driving attack. They rock and slash through Whip Comes Down, Respectable & Shattered so hard that it is a welcome relief when Mick sits at the keys and lays down an awesome take of Girl With Far Away Eyes that has Woodie on Pedal Steel & a guest violinist. After that Love In Vain proves that these British musicians can get up on a stage in Texas and be on par with any of the local Blues greats from Lightning Hopkins to Albert Collins to ZZ Top to Stevie Ray. I could go on and on, just know that this is without a doubt the peak of the Stones. No overblown stage props, no horn section, no background singers, just a bar band giving you the ultimate rock-n-roll fix. They still may not be my all time favorite (Zeppelin, Kinks, Beatles, Neil, Dead, etc are all up there for me along with the Stones) but there is little dispute as to why they are billed as the World's Greatest Rock-n-Roll Band. This video finally validated that proclamation.",1361491200,,1812,4.313782991202346

4852213,5,B005OGYH9A,"I am the Stones Authority. Look, this thing is getting reviewed through the roof for a reason, and the negative reviews tend to focus on technical issues. I must confess that they do not concern me. What a pleasant surprise the release of this DVD is. A great time to see the Stones too. Here they are after all the transition mess of the mid-70's with Ron Wood fully incorporated and a hit album to go out on stage with and strut. And this album is a strutter and you get most of it in this show, which is also nice. Many of the technical deficiencies that people complain about with ""Ladies & Gentlemen"" are absent here. It is well lit, it is reasonably well directed and it is all from one show. The idea that this hasn't seen the light of day until now is really quite something - what other gems like this await a similar release? Brussels? Hampton Roads? Los Angeles? I had heard something about a film floating around from this tour, but honestly I didn't put much stock in it and figured it was something on the order of ""C*** S***** Blues"" - some disjointed, mish mash of questionable production quality that one day would surface on some cheese ball over priced bootleg. Well, I was wrong. Good. This has to be considered the best Rolling Stones concert DVD - with perhaps only The Rolling Stones at the Max (Steel Wheels Tour and really great DVD) comparing with it or besting it. For now, this Stones concert DVD is my tops. I like the intimacy due to the size of the venue, the size of the stage and the camera positions. You get a better sense of what it is like to be at the ""show"" here than with any other Stones DVD, as far as I am concerned. And then also, the fact that the show is supporting the ""Some Girls"" album is great too. You get 7 songs from the 10 song album. That is pretty unusual too, but it contributes to the ""real"" concert feel of this show - as opposed to the ""revue"" style shows we have had from the Stones since Steel Wheels. It is a great album and the hi-lites from this concert - and there are several throughout - are terrific performances of ""Beast of Burden"" and ""Shattered"". You will love this DVD. If you don't, then you just don't get the Stones.",1357430400,,2193,4.286746987951807
4852214,5,B005OGYH9A,"This DVD brings back some great memories for this 49-year-old. I didn't attend this show, but Some Girls was the album that turned me into a Stones fan. I've bought a ton of other albums, compilations, and live shows since then. This DVD, along with Ladies and Gentleman: The Rolling Stones, are essential to any fan's collection. The Stones are stripped down to the bone. There's no costume changes here, no props, and very little talk. The band still has an element of danger about them.

There are 17 tracks on both the DVD and CD, so you get the full show either way. There's also some nice bonus features, including a 2011 interview with Mick Jagger, three performances from Saturday Night Live from 1978, and a piece on the band from the newsmagazine show 20/20 from 1978.

4852215,5,B005OGYH9A,"I'd always thought that '72 was the grand tour for the Stones , I had heard bootlegs from the '78 tour and liked them but nothing prepared me for this DVD, this is rock n roll at its best , forget those goofballs the New York Dolls a few years earlier , they couldn't touch this performance , in '78 the guys in Aerosmith could barley standup on sage let alone match the energy of this gig and Guns N Roses that came on the scene 9 yrs after this was filmed well they had some great moments on the concert stage but fame quickly ruined their shows. Mick was definitely influenced by the punk movement during this era and Keith had to be off smack here , his performance is amazing compared to gigs from '75 where he was just so out of it. I'd never thought much of Ron Wood but this gig changed my mind , he lays down some great guitar and backing vocals and looks at home as the newest Stone , Charlie as usual is on his game and Bill well all he needs to do is stand there and play. The small crowd is into it and have no problems with Mick throwing buckets of water on them at the end. The band just seems to be having a blast up there and yes it's a little weird with Mick hitting on Ronnie but he's Mick and he does and gets away with what he wants. Great sound quality and to me the picture quality is fine, when this was filmed in '78 I have a feeling nobody was thinking yrs ahead about VHS,DVD and now Blu Ray.

4852219,5,B005OGYH9A,"Here is a note to the stones on the eve of their 50th anniversary: hire Bill Wyman back (he KNOWS the bass notes to Stones songs and he IS (or was) the foundation of the sound), drop all your plans for those two hoity toity gigs in London and NY, drop all the lights and stage stuff and all the hired hands on stage, instead rent an indoor arena with ceiling fans, stack your Ampeg amps on stage and then watch this video!

This has to be the best Stones video I have seen since they finally issued Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones back earlier in the year. Of course recorded during their tour in support of then new album Some Girls, the stones are snarling tigers on this recording, especially during the songs from the new album showcased on this tour. To me this was pretty much the last gasp of real creativity from the boys and this film captures it all, and in excellent sound and image to boot. Even their ""greatest hits"" on here just snarl, and either they rerecorded the audio for this release or they were 100% on point that night. Just fabulous video. If you're tired of them trotting out the hits in a take it or leave it style, this is the video for you. Get it, you will not regret it.

Also includes the entire Saturday Night Live performance from the same tour and some other extras.

Only negative I can say is the way Jagger is gaying up to Ronnie in more than one place (you notice he don't do that to Keith, my bet is Keith would deck him on stage if he tried that foolishness on him), which is made all the more annoying by the rasta pin Woody is wearing (rastaman don't mess with gay), but all else here is out of the park.

Also have to thank the Stones for digging into the vaults and releasing these once-bootleg-only performances, like this and the aforementioned (and long awaited and wished for) Ladies and Gentlemen (also filmed in Texas I believe), plus the Muddy Waters session and that early aussie film (edit: I meant ""Charlie Is My Darling""...nothing whatsoever to do with ""Aussie""), now PLEASE consider releasing the Some Girls tour show at the Capital Theatre in Passaic NJ, source of the famous bootleg vinyl release Out On Bail/In Again Out Again, and my life will be nearly complete. These are turning out to be the best times ever for old school Stones collectors and fans!

Like I said at the beginning, Mick and Keith, watch this video, hire Bill back no matter what it takes, drop the pretense and show biz, and bring us out like you brought us in: pure excitement! You never sounded better than on stage alone with the Ampegs stacked behind you!

This DVD, which finds the Stones in Texas during their '78 tour, is a nice companion piece to the album.

4852228,5,B005OGYH9A,"Clearly the best live video/movie you'll ever see of the Stones. There is a certain intimacy and immediacy of this show that reveals the band at their best--in fact, it comes across as a club date. The recording is excellent, and you can feel every razor sharp cut of Keith's rhythm guitar. He truly was a guitar God. Ronnie Wood fits in smoothly, not overdoing it on lead guitar (like the live footage of Mick Taylor endlessly noodling that didn't always fit in live & was less effective and controlled than how great he sounded on record) and also settling in on rhythm, allowing Keith occasionally to take a strike or two. And though there is too much footage of Mick prancing around stage, he is never boring and has his own genius about him, and seems to have added the punk ethos into his strutting onstage--even his garb reflects the same. Still, I wish there was more footage of the musicians playing their instruments; Hey, how about one still frame on Charlie, who of course steadily sets the rhythmic tone to propel the band along.
 Added bonus is the SNL footage which is so beautifully raw, and as Mick reveals in the wonderfully revealing interviews, at this point, they are still getting used to playing the ""Some Girls"" songs live.",1342051200,3,1247,4.642533936651584
4852229,5,B005OGYH9A,"A fabulous, frenetic, off the hook performance by some so-called ""dinosaurs"" of rock, Summer 1978, just when punk and disco were waging a war to the death.  Rising above it all are the original punks, the anti-Beatles, presaging and outdistancing the more monochromatic Who by a year or so.  The Stones get away with every trick, from disco-Miss You to twangy Girl with Faraway Eyes to Chuck Berry Sweet Little 16 and everything in between.  It's like a history lesson in American music traditions, pumped through several dozen monsterous Ampeg rigs turned to 11 or 12, lovingly restored by audio guru Bob Clearmountain.  The soundtrack sync is perfect, no slapdash edits that don't match what is actually being played. It's a joy to listen to through headphones. Ronnie Woods' playing is from the heart, Keith as intense as Johnny Ramone ever was, Charlie Watts provides a drum clinic in keeping the groove, Mick showing, like a crazed marionette, why there is only one Mick Jagger. This is one of those dvd concerts everyone from 8 to 80 should have so that their collection of cultural artifacts of the mid-to-late 20th century is complete.

I've seen most of the Stones shows available on film and video and this one is definitely one of the best.  The lighting is atrocious and the 16mm source elements aren't perfect, but it really shows off this band at its rock and roll best.  Highly recommended!",1341014400,5,539,4.2772277227722775
4852231,5,B005OGYH9A,"I only just bought this and am blown away. A little of my history: About 10 years ago I had my entire music collection stolen. When I wearily set about replacing it I decided to make some savings by not replacing the live recordings. The primary reason for this was the Rolling Stones - Mick Jagger just did not sound like he did on the studio recordings.

Round about this time DVDs also started coming out and having an antipathy to live recordings I never bothered with these at all. My epithany (on the road to Damascus) came when I found the Led Zeppelin live DVD going for a ridiculously low price. I didn't particularly want it but found it so insulting to these legends to be sold so cheap I just bought it to get it off the shelf. What a revelation that was! Slowly but surely I began buying DVDs, deciding to have one per favourite group just to see them live.

That policy just didn't work with the Rolling Stones (though it has with many others) because quite literally each DVD I bought was better than the last. It has got to the point where I now own virtually every live DVD by the RS as well as most of their live CDs. More than that, I have now completely reversed my own music-buying philosophy to the point where I now buy virtually nothing but live music.

The Stones certainly are a visual act. I've read it all elsewhere in these reviews - and these reviews were the reason I bought Some Girls - but what are good tracks on the studio recording become great tracks live. My previous RS purchase was Ladies and Gentlemen, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but so far I find Some Girls a considerable improvement. They seem both more raw and better musicians, Mick is less effeminate and the songs are great. I have been acquiring RS DVDs backwards, in effect, from later to earlier performance. I'm dead keen to get some of the Brian Jones-era recordings now.",1340064000,2,1875,4.428985507246376

This version with the DVD and a CD of the concert is the one to buy. For any music marketing types reading this, DVD/CD combinations are the way to market concert DVDs, provided the price is right.

4852234,5,B005OGYH9A,"Please Help! Those of you who have watched this film may know the answer. In 1978 the Stones actually did TWO Some Girls concerts in DFW: first in Fort Worth then in Dallas. The first concert was word of mouth to the fortunate (like me) who purchased tickets to see ""The London Green Shoed Cowboys"" at Will Rogers Auditorium--indoor venue for just 2,000 in the audience! It was like having the Stones do a private party at your house. Sure they did some key songs from Some Girls (Beast of Burden, Shattered, Respectable), but they began with a full throttle heart thumping rendition of All Down the Line which sent chills up my spine. This concert was on a Thursday night and I had to be at work at 6:30am Friday (gut check, but I was still on a natural high from the concert). They took Friday off and Saturday night did the large crowd concert in Dallas.

If this DVD is of the concert of concerts at Will Rogers I must own it. Anybody know?

4852237,5,B005OGYH9A,"Keith once said that it wasn't fair for the stones to play for smaller audiences when there was a great deal of people wanting to see them in concert. Well ,what he really meant was, why should we make little money when we can make a lot?
This performance shows how really good they could be when they were playing like a rock band and not like a a global entertainment money making machine.  In nights like these, they could be called the best band on earth.
It is so good to see Ron Wood play with the same intensity and creativity like he did with the Faces.  He had so much to add to the band overall sound alternating dangerous and aggressive solos with Keith's more traditional blues based style.
The whole band sound terrific and energetic, they improvise and, if you pay attention,you can notice a few mistakes.  This only adds a human touch long gone to the stones career. No laser cannos, no back up singers or staged choreography.
But this was before Keith took control over the sound of the band and Ron became a mere support guitarist.  Before Mick Jagger lost his dangerous sexual moves, before the business schedule overwhelmed whatever freshness they still had left at this stage.
So enjoy it.  This is probably the best concert you will ever see ffrom them. At least, the closest one from a true blues joint band instead of a global multimillionaire brand.  This is rock and roll.",1331856000,3,1397,4.5458167330677295

What we have Here.. in ""Live in Texas '78"" is a Delicious Cherry-picked setlist that selected from across the board of The Stones' catalog. A BIG Bonus for us was to have (finaly in This release) a LIVE Version of ""Miss You"". Also another Bonus is a Live version of ""All down the line"" from ""Exile.."" A Prestine version of ""Far away eyes"" combining Just the right amount of ""cow-poke-tongue-in-cheek-Gospel"" to put a Smile on Anyones dial. It's Always Great to have Live vesions of ""When the whip comes down"", ""Love in vain"" & ""Imagination"". But.., The BIG Finale of ""Jumpin'Jack Flash"" HAS to be the Most Blistering Version that I've Ever heard! Sound Good??? You Bet Your Ass! Go get it NOW!!",1331337600,2,1142,4.715
4852239,2,B005OGYH9A,"This is an very good concert of the Rolling Stones, but the problem, is that it was recorded back in 1978, and when converted to Blu Ray, just not that good! You would be better off just getting a regular DVD!",1330128000,,209,4.121951219512195

4852241,3,B005OGYH9A,"Look, I was never a Rolling Stones fan during their ""heyday"".  I didn't really become a fan until the last few years.  The picture and sound quality are good for something from 1978.  No complaints there.  I love the ""Live at the MAX"" bluray; they're much older, it's a bigger show production and you can feel the show energy.  This is just too much of Mick being Mick.  Over the top, lots of grabbing and feeling up of himself, etc.  When I bought this I thought I might not like it (much like the Ladies and Gentleman release) and I kind of just found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of it.",1329782400,,598,4.333333333333333
4852242,5,B005OGYH9A,"Boy was I surprised when I heard this through my surround sound. It's DTS remastered sound and boy did he do It right. The concert Is at a high point In there career. THE ""SOME GIRLS"" album.
The concert IS NOT DISTORTED in the least. Like so many Stones concerts are today. From ""Shine a Light"" they sound sloppy now compared to this time. The 2 guitars working together form a unique sound that's The Stones yet so clear and Mick Is way toned down. He dances and jumps In place much more today than here. He at his best.
The picture not as clear as something today but they did a swell job at remastering It so It's viewable well and In Blu Ray.
I can not recommend a Stones concert any higher. Mick's voice on ""Miss You"" the who who who who. He does It all well live. And with 5 or 6 songs off the new album being played, way more than usual. But they all the classics from that album. ""Far Away Eyes"" many more. Beast of Burdon Included too.
AH and a final big plus. here an 2011 Interview with Mich Jagger about this time period and the concert and music.
Then from other TV shows Including Saturday Night Live. LOT good extras not stuff never watch. I was 19 years old. This album got me Into the Rolling Stones and I'm sure many others from my era.
No fan will be disappointed with this one.
The sound so good. The DTS surround Is exceptional. Sounds as If recorded today not 30 years ago. That how good a remastering on the music.
I am so happy I picked this up. The price Is not bad either for all the work went into making the film so good to sell now.",1328918400,2,1561,4.121311475409836
4852243,5,B005OGYH9A,Just before this concert Mick's limo was caught up with by a reporter in downtown Dallas. He got out fast on a street that was at Nieman Marcus. He quickly answered a couple of questions but the thing I mostly noticed was that he was wearing an all white suit. Only Mick could wear it with the ultimate in cool. He was so cool.,1328486400,,327,4.125
4852244,3,B005OGYH9A,"Sorry, but I still think the concerts at Madison Square Garden in 1969 are unsurpassed. They were still extremely good in 1978, but the disco-era and partying had taken its toll.
The hard R&B rocking had been replaced with a more 80's-like beat. The song ""Miss You"" has never sounded good live.",1328227200,4,294,4.673076923076923
4852245,5,B005OGYH9A,"As a Rolling Stones fan I am so thrilled that Mick and the boys have finally decided to dust-off some of the true rock & roll gems that have been collecting dust in some lawyers vault somewhere, and release them for us to enjoy! This concert is a great example of why the Stones have been called ""The greatest rock and roll band in the world"". The set list is loaded with songs that will become some of their greatest hits, such as, Beast of Burden, Miss You, When the whip comes down and Just my imagination, just to name a few. The quality of the dvd is outstanding and looks like it was with todays technology. The band is full of energy and having a great time. My only complaint is that the title track of, Some Girls, is for some reason not on the set list. Too bad, because it's a great song and the title of the album. Why leave that song off the set list? I'm sure they performed it during the concert. But that being said, you must have this true rock gem in your collection of Stones material!",1327968000,3,1004,4.180412371134021
4852246,5,B005OGYH9A,This product was everything we wanted it to be.  We were very happy with everything!  Definate must for the true Rolling Stones fan to add to their collection.,1327881600,2,159,4.642857142857143
4852247,5,B005OGYH9A,"If you only own one DVD/BluRay performance of the Rolling Stones, this should be it. Smallish stage, none of the distractions of monster blow up dolls or other contraptions, no backup singers, no horn section, just the Stones and their piano player and a pretty much unseen organ. Not that the horns and Lisa Fisher, Bernie Fowler, et al don't add to the show on a larger stage, they most definitely do, but this is the Stones in about as basic a form as you will find them.

The sound is superb. The video is as it should be, and likely the best it could be given the original medium. The performance is non-stop, with Mick being especially ""playful"", especially in grabbing Ronnie where he might not ought to have. Bill Wyman is as Bill Wyman was, appearing suitably bored throughout. But, who went to see Wyman anyway? Keith was on, how that happens is always a mystery, as was Ron Wood, though Woodie didn't seem quite as animated as he is at times. Charlie is his rock steady, never miss a beat self. Overall, it is a Jagger focused show as usual, with just enough time on the rest of the band to know they were there with him.

Overall, this is my favorite Stones video, and I have them all. Maybe that opinion might change if the Brussels Affair is ever released on video, if you have an isp or proxy outside the US you can download a flac version of the Brussels Affair audio from the Stones marketing website and it is quite good, with Mick Taylor on guitar, and very up tempo. So I am hoping that show makes it onto video before too long. Meantime, enjoy Some Girls-Live in Texas '78 (and perhaps you can remember their names).",1327536000,4,1637,4.399339933993399
4852248,5,B005OGYH9A,"Like other reviewers I attended this same show.  Also I've owned the incomplete half hour bootleg video and a cassette soundboard recording of the complete show for 15 years.  Of the many hours of pirated live Stones video/audio in my collection this is among my favorites.  That's why I eagerly purchased upgraded DVD/CD versions.  The reasons are many.

Charlie Watts' Moon-the-Loon drumming is untypical of him, I've gone to shows from seven or eight tours and never seen Charlie so bombastic.  Keef's incisive riffing is an intense rush as he drops phrases and fills with a surgeon's precision into the pauses of Jagger's vocals, which are excellent for being unforced but powerful.  He belts every word of Sweet Little Sixteen correctly, except the few he changes on purpose.  Ron Wood plays musical foil to Richards' guitar lines as well as being a visual foil of Mick's, their clowning at the front of the stage add adrenaline to the overall performance.  Bill Wyman had injured his wrist walking off the edge of the stage four shows earlier on the tour and doctors advised him to cancel the remaining dates; his response was to check out of the hospital the next day and, not only played a concert in St. Louis that night, but eight more to complete the tour.  Wyman and Ian Stewart's abilities and presence anchor this truly authentic Stones show, not the Rolling Stones Big Band tours we've witnessed the last twenty years.

That being said, I don't think this is the Stones' pinnacle, yet they still had  street cred, seven out of 25 concerts in 1978 were small hall shows billed under ridiculous names like the London Green-Shoed Cowboys.  It became fashionable among name bands to play clubs under assumed names, i.e. Aerosmith's unannounced gigs as Dr. J. Jones & the Interns shortly after the Stones did it and validated the concept.  By `78 the Stones were past their 1972 peak although still walking and talking it convincingly.  I saw two stops of their `72 American summer run and thought they were far better than this particular night.  Bobby Keys and Jim Price occupying the Stones' bandstand never bothered me a bit.  And it goes without saying that EXILE ON MAIN STREET songs are superior to the ones on SOME GIRLS.  Despite my preferences I still rate this DVD five stars for its punk rock energy.

Stevie Wonder opened for the Stones in '72 and his act was terrific but by no means did he steal a bolt of their thunder.  Peter Tosh opened for them at this show and I can assure you his band blew the Stones off the stage.  That hard groovin' reggae sounded superb in Will Rogers Auditorium and I kept thinking Watts & Co. were going to have to be on top of their game to follow Tosh.  I thought they were good that night but not great.  In hindsight they sound gritty and enthusiastic, great even.  Doug Kershaw doesn't count; I remember the Ft. Worth audience booed the poor guy off the stage before his band could finish their set.

Last and least: a lot of Amazon reviewers seem to think Jagger's trousers were leather.  I distinctly recall them being plastic, only a grade heavier than a garbage bag.  Photos from the '78 tour indicate he had three pairs: black, red, and yellow.  Toward the end of the tour he patched tears in these pants with Xs of red gaffer's tape.",1327017600,,3299,4.65112262521589
4852249,5,B005OGYH9A,"For whatever reason, warranted or not, the Stones had not released any live documentation from their '78 tour.  Some shows were not good, but this one is red hot.  No great theatrics we have come to expect from the band in the last 30 years, but this show with minimal back up musicians provides a back to basics raw sound that epitomized the time.  I never really cared for Miss You until this version was released.  It is smokin' with guitars prominent in the mix.  When the Whip Comes Down nearly steals the show for me as do most of the Some Girls tracks.  Even Far Away Eyes, my least favorite cut (would have preferred Claudine, I Love You Too Much, or Tallahassie Lassie from the Deluxe Edition to have replaced Far Away Eyes back in '77-78) has a fresh albeit country sound.

Interview with Mick is very revealing of how Some Girls came to be as well as how he choreographed and devised the setlist for these shows.  To boot, this edition adds an audio recording of the show you can play in your car or wherever.  It removes the useless banter Mick may have with the crowd, yet captures the entire show.  The Stones should have added a cd or double cd if necessary when Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones was released in 2010.

I don't know how many really good performances the Stones gave on their short '78 tour.  Some of the bootlegs are good, some the band sounds ""out to lunch"".  On this night in Texas, the Stones were as hot as the temps inside and outside the theatre in Fort Worth.  Kicking show for a great price.  If you're a Stones fan, this is a must.  If you're a casual listener who may recall fondly the late '70s music of disco, punk, rap's origination, country, this disc and this show is worth every penny.  It's 30 + years overdue, but it is finally here.",1326844800,,1789,4.372727272727273
4852250,4,B005OGYH9A,"It's fantastic to see the Stones perform live on their '78 tour, and the film is nicely shot.  The added bonus of the Stones performing their mini-set on SNL is also great... I'll never forget seeing that when I was a kid.  Added bonus of the SNL skit with Dan Akroyd, as Tom Snyder, interviewing Mick.  The price is right... you can't go wrong.",1326758400,2,345,4.359375
4852251,5,B005OGYH9A,"I came late to the Rolling Stones love train and I judge them as someone who didn't grow up with them and therefore has no emotional ties to their music.  If it hadn't been for Keith Richards autobiography, ""Life"", I probably would never have given them a serious listen.  However, I read ""Life"" and then watched the DVDs ""Gimme Shelter"", ""Shine a Light"" and this one, ""Some Girls"".  ""Some Girls"" is by far the best in terms of video and audio quality and catching the energy and musicality of the Stones.  ""Gimme Shelter"" is more of a documentary with less Stone's music and more drama.  Watch if you'd like a glimpse of the zombie apocalypse set to old Stone's music.  ""Shine a Light"" is filmed by a movie director, has a much more polished production aspect to it and is filmed when the band is much older.  ""Some Girls"" is filmed, imo, when the Rolling Stones are at their peak physically and musically.  Keith does not appear to be drug addled and is fantastic on guitar and vocals.  He's really fully present, not goofing around and gives a bravura performance.  Mick Jagger answers any questions you may have about ""what does everyone see in this guy?"".  He's the definition of sexual energy and charisma.  His vocals are polished and compelling and he's never looked better. In other words he's off the hook fabulous.  Charlie Watts on drums gets little screen time but is the heart of the music and Ron Woods is animated, a fantastic guitar player and works well with Keith.  The bass player Bill Wyman, hangs back in the wings, you kind of forget he's there but whatever - lots of different personalities in the band if you can believe Keith.  The set list is a very nice compilation of Stone's older tried and true favorites and stuff from their then new album, Some Girls.  The combination of old and new keeps them on their toes and thrills the fans at the venue.  In conclusion, I would recommend this DVD to anyone that likes rock or blues or the Rolling Stones or a spectacle of any kind.  It stands the test of time and is very entertaining.",1326585600,,2058,4.531165311653116

Nice bonus material on the BluRay disc - great sound",1326585600,,138,4.56
4852253,5,B005OGYH9A,"After finding the time to watch Some Girls Live In Texas '78 and living with its companion live CD all week, I'm fully prepared to call it my favorite Stones live album. I mean, the extended Get Your Ya Ya's Out and the Brussels Affair bootleg are really great, but they're simply not in this league.  The Stones are just playing white hot in this show.

Is it the most visually exciting thing you'll ever see? Not really, although Mick is really on and as charismatic as you'll ever see him live, whether it be here, Ladies and Gentlemen, or any of the later films like Shine A Light.

It doesn't matter.

The Stones are stripped down (this is a small, 3000 seat venue with a plain stage), and out to show they are the toughest, ballsiest band out there. Every track is sharp, and the undeniable star is the Some Girls album, with six of the seventeen tracks coming from Some Girls.  The funny thing is that Some Girls always comes off as one of their most polished studio albums, and here, it's intense, aggressive and bluesy.  Oddly, as much as we think of Keith and Mick as that central partnership of the Stones, on stage here, it's Mick and Ronnie, which I've never seen on any other live document.

If you're a Stones fan, you not only have to buy this one, but you have to make sure you get the CD included with it, because you will want to be listening to it even when you're not watching it.",1326499200,2,1401,4.324427480916031
4852254,5,B005OGYH9A,"A must for any Stones fan! Sound and picture quality is good considering the concert footage was shot in 16mm! Also bonus clips from SNL and interviews. See the Stones in their prime, doing was they do best! Highly recommended!!",1326067200,,228,4.725
4852255,5,B005OGYH9A,"This DVD is a must have for all Rolling Stone-philes.  Video and sound are excellent.  Also, this video showcases Ron Wood's gifted guitar work before he developed the odious predilection for showboating verses simply playing as the adroit guitarist and professional he has so eloquently demonstrated in this DVD.  With that said, I highly recommend this to RS fans and newbys, alike.",1325548800,,384,5.161290322580645
4852256,5,B005OGYH9A,"I loved this document of the 1978 tour, filmed at the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas. This is a relatively small venue show, with only about 3,000 fans packing the hall. Jagger puts on a terrific show, belting out some of these songs with a ferocious energy rare even for him. Quite a few ""Some Girls"" tracks are played - all in a row, seven I believe - so liking that album is definitely helpful going in. Keith steps up for a great version of ""Happy,"" and Ron Wood shares some amusing interplay with Jagger. Charlie and Bill are rarely shown. There were no horns for this show, just a pair of keyboard players.

The concert was filmed on 16mm film and is grainy - but the quality is quite good. Audience reactions shots are thankfully kept to a minimum. Apparently this summer indoor show was swelteringly hot, and Mick douses the crowd with several buckets of water near the end.

It's a super good idea to include the concert as an audio CD. Even though this release is available as JUST a DVD or Blu-ray, both versions are available with the live CD. I highly recommend the combo.  I have limited time to invest in rewatching concert films - even if they're as good as this one! - so it's great to have the audio on CD.",1325548800,2,1242,4.367965367965368
4852257,5,B005OGYH9A,"I almost didn't buy this due to the dumb cover and not thinking the Some Girls tour would be that good , boy was I wrong! I have to agree with another reviewer that this rivals ""Ladies And Gentlemen"" as the best DVD by the band, in fact in terms of actual performances of the songs it could be better, except that 72 was ground zero for the peak of the Stones song selection, However this show has the Stones in full throttle with as much energy as any punk band at the time.
 Clearly ready to rock. Keith and Mick still look young and both are out to prove something. No stage props, no horns or lady singers, Just let the guitars play, Keith and Ronnie just churn out the songs with Ronnie showing surprising ability on backing vocals with both Mick and Keith and plays a mean slide that while not up to Mick Taylor level is still very good and a revelation. Charlie is on fire, Wyman solid, founding member Ian Stewart adds boogie piano and the Chuck Berry covers are mint. The Some Girls songs are greater than the album and not rote reproductions as are the oldies mixed in. Even Miss You is a showstopper and there is not a bad song like in later tours where they had to throw in new songs to sell the album, these songs sell themselves.  Mick does go nuts during this show which both jaw dropping and sometimes laugh out loud funny and wears the weirdest outfit ever seen but hey, its Mick. For those who only think of the drugs  this dvd shows that at least up to 1978 the Stones were still the worlds greatest rock band.",1325462400,,1529,4.247422680412371
4852258,3,B005OGYH9A,"I'll probably get nothing but ""unhelpful"" votes for this review but oh, well.

First of all, the video and audio portions of the Blu Ray are quite good, considering it was recorded in 1978. No complaints about that, they did a great job of transferring this to disc.

I have to say, I am not a huge Stones fan. I do like many of their songs but I've always been one who prefers the Beatles style over the Stones style. I did want to see a good concert video of the Stones, however, and so based on the reviews of Some Girls, I purchased this one.

Personally, while some reviewers have said the performance and the level of musicianship was spot on, to me it sounded very loose and sloppy.  Yes, everyone is rocking out but I found a sameness to much of the performance. I could only understand about 25% of the words Mick Jagger was singing.  I figure most folks who were in the audience, and most who buy this Blu Ray are diehard fans of the band and loved every minute of the concert. I thought it was good, but not great as so many people have described it.

I purchased the Cream Live at Royal Albert Hall 2005 Blu Ray at the same time and prefer that concert. I know it is sort of like apples to oranges since Cream was not concerned about whipping the audience into a frenzy or putting on an entertainment spectacular - they were there to play their music rather than to strut around the stage and look like they were partying. I guess I am more of a music than a show person, though - the level of musicianship was much higher and the concert itself was more interesting.

Going back to the Some Girls Blu Ray - I'd rather listen to the studio versions of the songs. There's something to be said about the video appeal of this Blu Ray (if you want to watch them put on a show) but if you have your eyes closed and just listen to the music, it sounds pretty sloppy.",1325462400,5,1872,4.212290502793296

However, in this case, you get every penny's worth, down to seeing the sweat dripping off Mick and the boys in spite of the giant ceiling fans whirling above the stage.  The show starts with the giant Chuck Berry-bomb, ""Let It Rock"" and percolates pretty much nonstop, only slowing down for a few numbers towards the end so that the band and audience don't pass out from the heat.  The stars just seem to align in every possible way -- the size of the theater is just right, the band incredibly tight, and the stage stripped of any silly props.  Ya-Ya's is often cited as their best live recording, but this is not only longer, but more energetic, loud, and fun.  The only possible thing I can say is that the CD should be released as a stand-alone product...it's that good.  Some may also quibble about the video quality, but that's to be expected of a blu-ray disc playing on an HDTV which shows every limitation of the 33-year-old video technology used to record this.",1325116800,,1131,4.482926829268293

4852265,4,B005OGYH9A,"This legendary performance has been widely bootlegged for years, so it's great to finally have a 'first gen' copy to watch and enjoy. The Stones are on fire in this performance, marred only by Mick's campy performance. Mick went through a very campy period and the '78 tour was the zenith (or nadir depending on your view). During the bonus 2011 interview, Mick goes to great lengths to explain his stage costume. He must realize how stupid it looks in retrospect and is trying to cover for it. Luckily the rest of the band is tight and you can see and hear the great Ian Stewart on the piano. The picture quality is actually quite good considering that this was filmed (yes filmed) in 1978. The bonus features include the also widely-bootlegged Saturday Night Live performance when Mick's voice was shot by doing coke all week long during rehearsals. (True story. Read any reliable book on Stones history.) Mick camps it up more than ever, licking Ronnie's face and shamelessly pandering to the camera. Some younger fans may not get the ""Tomorrow"" skit and probably have no idea who Tom Snyder was. That segment may go right over your heads but it was priceless comedy at the time. The performance is a bit sloppier than the concert footage due to the week long party in the studio. In the end, if you have any interest whatsoever in the Stones you should see this, and it is a MUST BUY for anyone who claims to be a fan of the band.",1325030400,,1434,4.519230769230769
4852266,5,B005OGYH9A,"Keith Richards is the stand-out on this great DVD.  Hey, I thought he was supposed to be a junkie at the time, but this has to be after his recovery because his guitar playing is nothing short of spectacular. He runs through a varity of Telecasters in different tunings producing a literal scorched earth policy.  It is really the best I have seen him be on camera. He gives his contemporaries like Clapton, Page and Beck a good run for the money on this video.

Overdubs that characterize much of the Stones early video work, including their 1969 concert film, are noticably absent.

On the other hand, I am sure I listened closely and Ron Wood wasn't amped for many  of the songs.  When he was needed or featured he was mixed in, and much of the time he appears to be strumming, but there is no or very little sound contributed from his guitar.  There is even a spot near the end in Jumping Jack Flash,when Keith has technical problems that result in no guitar part at all being heard, and Ronnie, although shown playing while Keith attempts to correct the problem, is completely silent. This is not to say Ron Wood isn't a talented guitarist but you cant help but think it was intentional to mix his volume down when Keith was delivering the way he was. It is like Clapton said a few years before this concert, that Keith was enough guitar for the band and they didn't really need anyone else.

Jagger gives an energetic performance, but his wardrobe isn't simply dated. He is wearing a white t-shirt with a giant nazi sign on it, and leather pants that literally leave little to the imagination.  That should be enough to get most fans to buy this DVD.

Id have to say that Jaggers wardrobe and the missing sound from Ronnies amp was enough to say the video and audio output was not what the producer expected, even if Keith stole (or rightfully took lead and complete possession of) the show. That is probably why it was in the can for so long.

The gem is that the Stones still sound incredible amid the dysfucntion and that dysfunction cannot be contributed to the bands regular scapegoat, Mr. Richards.

The listener is left with no doubt why the band carried the title of The Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the World into and out of this Dallas show.",1324944000,2,2257,4.464720194647202

4852268,5,B005OGYH9A,"What these reviews are missing is that this is a Stones concert circa 1978. Back in the 70's rock concerts were rough, raw and loud, abscent were the big productions and special effects. That is what made 70's rock so great. This concert is a must have addition to your Stones collection. Keith and Ronnie are in great form with fine guitar playing and the best solos this reviewer has heard from the Stones. Charlie is great as usual. ""Sweet Little 16"", ""Respectable"" and ""Star Star"" in it's non-politicaly correct version were among the best and it is obvious the band were having a good time with these numbers. ""Happy"" is more of a Mick-Keith duet which is fantastic. You will never see Happy performed like this on ""40 Flicks"" or ""Biggest Bang"" concert DVD's.

4852270,4,B005OGYH9A,"Thisis essentially the same group we watched at the TAMI Show way back when, and all the remaining Stones look ready to roll...and definitely ready to rock. And rock they do on WHEN THE WHIP COMES DOWN, ALL DOWN THE LINE, SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN, RESPECTABLE, HAPPY and others.

It's mainly uptempo (with some telling fluffs), though LOVE IN VAIN (with some of the feel STRAY CAT BLUES, live at MSG in '69), and FAR AWAY EYES (not a classic but nifty B-side material), serve as reminders of this group's diverse catalogue (and some cardiovascular relief for the wildly enthused attendees).

Casual fans will especially enjoy watching Jagger bang out a few chords of his own on many numbers (and even on keyboard!).

The guys look great, about five years older than they did at TAMI, though Jagger looks like he's missed a few meals along the way - fashion model skinny, and horribly outfitted. (He discusses ""wardrobe"" during the fascinating 2011 Interview in the features).

It's always rewarding to atch the Stones pay direct or indirect tribute to their ""idols"" and the two Berry covers are predictably great; while Keith is celebrating Chuck, Mick is doing the same for another 1950s legend named Richard. Too bad they couldn't work in a number by the guy who took the group on ttheir first important European tour, in late 1963. [Mick even throws in a couple of ""Oh My Soul""(s)].

This Texas show was captured long before the present day tendency towards ""cool"" caera work, with hectic editing, and next to no audience shots. The lenses actually score on close-ups of super engaged fans - mostly female - today that approach would be considered ""sexist"".",1324771200,,1656,4.837455830388692
4852271,5,B005OGYH9A,"After years of listening to a bootleg recording of this show, it's great to be able to finally watch it.
I really loved this short,ragged tour. The Stones never sounded the same after this tour. Switching from Ampeg amps to Messa Boogie
really changed the guitar sound from warm and full to tiny and thin. I miss the days when the back up vocalists were Keith and Ronnie.
Not some hired side men and women. How wonderful it is to watch Mick and Keith at the same microphone belting out Happy.

4852273,5,B005OGYH9A,"According to the essay in the eight-page booklet that comes with the DVD, the band announced a secret gig in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 18th, 1978 at the Will Rogers Auditorium, a 3,000-seater, under cover as ""The London Green Shoed Cowboys"". Everybody saw through the ruse, and tickets were in high demand.

The DVD is a testament to a pretty good show. The band goes out and does their thing, with Mick covered up in a hat and jacket and some sort of weird mock leather track pants, which he slowly peels off part by part as the show goes on - the hat goes, then the jacket, and finally also the shirt. There's the usual onstage Stones chaos, and at one point we see a roadie mopping up some spill onstage. Keith looks frazzled, and pretty sloppy in a weird silk shirt, but he pulls through. Unlike Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, this concert was recorded on one night, rather than edited together from parts recorded over a series of nights.

For a few songs, Mick plays a brown Stratocaster as a prop (does his playing really make a difference, if he's even playing at all?). Looks like Elvis or Bruce Dickinson slinging a guitar - awkward. Keith plays a tan Telecaster (then, later on, a black Telecaster), Woody is on a mirrored Les Paul. Mick tries to smooch Ron Wood, later grabs his jeans, even later slaps his behind - must be some weird initiation thing. Mick's trying to look like Bob Dylan singing powerfully with a guitar, but he looks more like a proto-Bryan Adams (what I'm really trying to say is that he shouldn't play guitar - and after that he didn't). ""Just My Imagination"" jam, Mick bug-eyed at the end. Mick has guitar for four songs in a row (""When The Whip Comes Down"", Beast Of Burden"", ""Miss You"" and ""Imagination""), leaves it off for the next song, then picks it up again for ""Respectable"". Woody picks a cigarette (?) up off the floor, offers it to Mick. Mick, with jacket, looks like he has no arms. ""Shattered"" ends with a jab. ""Are you feeling good? I always feel good in Texas; I'm afraid if the band's slightly lacking in energy is because they spent all of last night loving. But we do our best."" Mick on piano for ""Far Away Eyes"", he then moves to keyboard. Ron Wood on slide. Fiddlist Doug Kershaw (who had opened the show), came back to play on this song - jarring. ""Love In Vain"", Ron Wood plays black and silver Telecaster slide. ""Tumbling Dice"", Woody plays mother of pearl-flecked Les Paul, Mick grabs his jeans again at 1:04:00. Mick finally removes jacket. In ""Happy"", he pretends to slap Woody's face, then slaps his behind. There's a bit of a tongue thing. Best song on concert. Keith is ferocious. In ""Brown Sugar"", Mick removes shirt, whips Woody with it (of course). Big girl in back going crazy. Crowd response, Mick throws water on audience.

The documentary has 15 minutes of interview with Sir Mick, and 20 minutes from a 1978 Saturday Night Live performance, and then about two minutes of American TV interviewing - 20/20, with some stuff from Geraldo Rivera.

In the documentary, Mick talks about the tolerant musical diversity of the time in New York, with acceptance of dance music, punk and country all happening at the same time. Mentions the Sugarhill Gang, referenced Dr Dre's remix of ""Miss You"" of many years later, I guess he's hinting that the band was ahead of their time. ""Shattered"" has semi-rap sing-talk in it. You really see how old he is here, with big eccentric House of Lords-style eyebrows and small eyes. Mick dresses in a white suit and records the Tomorrow Show with Dan Ackroyd, who has multi-coloured hair and smokes a cigarette throughout the piece. Mick has fun with Dan, not the other way around, ha ha ha... Nothing special in the interview, but the live footage is good, especially as they play the same egalitarian sound stage that all other SNL performers use. Mick steals Woody's cig, then whips him on the face and jeans with his towel. Jeez! Mick sounds like Buster Poindexter now, does crazy kung fu moves in ""Beast of Burden"" and spits on the SNL stage in ""Respectable"". Mick tongues Woody's lips. In the 20/20 interview with Geraldo Rivera, he asks Bill what makes Mick Jagger one of the best frontmen. ""Ego."" Bill thought that they'd last 2-3 years, never 16 (and that was half way through his career with the Rolling Stones - by the time he left, they'd been together 32 years).",1324252800,2,4384,4.588010204081633

4852275,5,B005OGYH9A,"Bill Wyman, the long time bass guitar player for the Rolling Stones, once said that the band was the greatest live act in Rock & Roll for the 15 years following their breakthrough in 1964. After seeing this concert movie, unreleased for decades in the band's archive, I agree one hundred percent. It is nothing less than a rock fan's dream to get to the see the Stones in concert from 1978, catching fire once again after a few years of coasting on fading momentum. Jagger's performance is one of the best that I have seen, bar none. Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood are in peak form and Charlie Watts is on fire behind the drum kit. The concert is nicely sequenced, beginning with several classic rockers followed by several tunes from the recently released Some Girls album. The band closes the show out with several more classic rockers. No playing around, no nostalgia tunes, just straight up rock and roll from a band getting its second career wind. The blu ray picture is awesome, like you are in the audience. The sound is authentic, loud and raw, giving you a sense of what it was like to see the Stones in a small venue in Texas in the late 70's. Fans of the band will love this video, and fans of rock music will get an earful of late 70's rock at its finest.",1323907200,4,1267,4.395744680851064

I own Biggest Bang, the 4 disc version, Ladies and Gentlemen, blue-ray and I now own Some Girls, blue-ray. I would highly recommend any of these. In Some Girls, the video quality is only slightly lesser than my other two mentioned. It is still very very good and should be completely acceptable to all those videophiles, aka picky f's out there - remember, it's 1978.... I have a 72"" Tv and this looks great to me. The sound is great. My favorite part of Some Girls is the playlist. Its AWESOME! Gotta love Far Away Eyes! Even my wife, whose's not a fan, likes this one and requests it...(thats say'in something). While I enjoy their newer HD recorded shows, wrinkles and all..., I prefer the older ones like Ladies and Gentleman and Some Girls. I now wonder what else is in the vault. Wish some of the other great bands recorded their shows, let alone used film like they did here. This is a keeper and I would highly recommend this to anyone. This is about as good as it gets, short of a time-machine. Actually, that's exactly what this is, a time-machine in blue-ray. Enjoy!",1323820800,,1180,4.493023255813953

The band was tight, Mick's vocals were especially strong in my opinion and the performance was very spirited and enjoyable to watch.  There was a lot of passion put into the Some Girls material and was played very well.  I enjoyed the Some Girls material on the Blu-ray even more than the studio album.  The audio was clear and you could hear all the guitars even when Mick was playing.  The video is more than serviceable.  A little grainy?  Sure, but so what.

4852282,5,B005OGYH9A,"Before the Rolling Stones started doing rediculous stadium shows with huge horn sections and complex stages and 200-foot-tall inflatable dogs, they did shows like THIS.  The focus was on the music.  This film captures the band at the top of their game.  Jagger still had soul and hadn't yet become a parody of himself.  I've never been a Ronnie Wood fan, as I feel Mick Taylor shreds him on guitar.  But this show captures Ronnie working his *** off with Keith Richards to provide that quintessential dual-guitar attack the Stones have been famous for.  Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman are very good too.  But the show is, as it's always been, about Mick Jagger.  In 1978, he was still just a singer, and he sings every song here with heart, soul and charm.  The Stones clearly still had something to prove and their work ethic during this show is unbelievable, ferocious and unmatched.  If your bucks are limited, don't bother with 'Bridges to Babylon' or 'The Biggest Bang' or 'Four Flicks.'  Pick THIS disc up and watch the Stones at the height of their musical prowess.",1322611200,4,1070,4.698924731182796
4852283,5,B005OGYH9A,"Shortly after the release of one of their greatest albums (""Some Girls"") the Stones began a tour of the U. S.  In addition to scheduling opened air stadiums like Soldier Field in Chicago and domed stadiums like New Orleans' Superdome, they scheduled several smaller venues like The Fox Theater in Atlanta and Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth, Texas (my current home).  Under the pseudo name of ""The London Green Shoed Cowboys"", the Stones appeared during a 105 degree summer evening in 1978.

Ron Wood had been with the band for the last 3 of the Stones 16 year collaboration at this point.  They decided to film this concert in front of 3000 loyal 20-something fans using a Texas based company called Showco.  They do a stellar job under the circumstances using several hand held but stable cameras.  The direction is very good.  You get to enjoy the music and the atmosphere not a series of fast cuts and camera tricks.  The concert itself clocks in at about 85 minutes but there is no filler.

They open the show with start-em-up rockers ""Let It Rock"", ""All Down the Line"" and ""Honky Tonk Women.""  They never let up.  The Rolling Stones were at their best during this show, which had numerous songs from their new album (""Miss You"", ""When the Whip Comes Down"", ""Imagination"", countrified ""Far Away Eyes"", ""Respectable"", and ""Shattered"").  Mick Jagger is in high gear and prances all over the stage, taking time to get close to the fans.  He also seemed a bit taken with Wood, playfully fondling and snuggling up to him on occasion.  A little weird I thought.  I digress.

Perhaps the best reason of all to own this concert is a spectacular DTS-HD sound treatment (in addition to Dolby Digital and PCM Stereo).  The entire disc last about 128 minutes with some added features.  Specifically a 2011 interview of Mick Jagger by Paul Sexton where he reflects back on this concert and tour and  a 1978 skit from ""Saturday Night Live"" featuring Jagger and Dan Akroid.  This is followed by a rare (for SNL) 3 song performance by the band.  Finally there is a brief segment from ABC 20/20, also in 1978 which features the band (Bassist Bill Wyman actually speaks!) being interviewed by long haired Geraldo Rivera.  This is a solid Blu ray concert worth owning if you are a fan of rock n' roll at its best.",1322611200,5,2304,4.650990099009901
4852284,5,B005OGYH9A,"I have to admit not really caring for ""Some Girls"" at the time it was released in '78. So many people mistook it for a great album at the time. An easy assumption when compared to the three LPs that came before it, one of which was a slap-dash ""greatest hits"" package. I read favorable reviews about the resulting tour and actually bought a couple of bootlegs taken from radio broadcasts. Ah, sez I, the boys are feeling frisky.

Now comes this DVD/CD set. After so many years of being a circus act the Stones went for a stripped-down approach around this time. There's nothing punk or new wave about it, just the ""greatest rock and roll band in the world"" making a renewed claim to the title. Jagger's delivery smacks of Dylan and Lou Reed here and there, dripping with sardonic wit. Ian MacLagan plays keyboards and Ian Stewart's boogie woogie piano pops up here and there. The band plays with enthusiasm and vigor that was noticeably lacking in the performances documented on ""Love You Live.""

4852288,5,B005OGYH9A,"This one is so awesomely intoxicating, it's spooky. All in a GREAT way.

Where has this gem been hiding? Thank goodness someone had the wisdom to raid the vast archival library (of Stones recordings) and release this filmed beauty on DVD. Gorgeous moment in rock & roll history, wonderfully captured for posterity!

For perspective, let's make it clear this concert performance by The Stones is so exciting & INTENSE that their other live DVDs pale in comparison. While the other prime era documents of their live shows --- ""Rock & Roll Circus,"" ""Gimme Shelter"" & ""Ladies & Gentlemen... The Rolling Stones"" included --- ain't too shabby & are remarkably accomplished, this 1978 concert performed in Ft. Worth, Texas is the GOLD standard.

The Stones are ON-FIRE & extremely animated throughout most of this gig. ""Far Away Eyes"" and ""Love in Vain"" are the only possible exceptions to this rule, yet they still remain entertaining & intriguing viewing. The rest of the set is pure rockin' ecstasy & absolutely off-the-charts! To see & hear the band interpret the ""Some Girls"" material is delightfully revelatory; The Stones attack the new tunes with wild abandon and are obviously enjoying the overall experience. Fortunately, this spirit of unbridled ENERGY has been spectacularly captured on-camera and faithfully transferred to DVD.

The cinematography contained on the DVD is stellar & first-rate in all respects. The visuals have elements of in-your-face close-ups (when following the music warrants such tight shots) but wider, more all-inclusive camera angles are also present which allow the viewer to see the entire stage. The framing of almost all of the shots is predicated upon the cameraman's desire to fully document all of the action. On this score & in the editing process, the director/producer is very successful in capturing all of Mick Jagger's feverish moves & stage antics. It is also notable that the edits are not manic or annoyingly slapdash in nature. No MTV-style slashing edits, leading to nauseousness, are to be found here. The pacing is measured & entirely sensible...a pleasure to behold, completely complimentary to the rock music being played.

Highlights: Almost too many to mention but ""Shattered"" is performed in appropriately blistering fashion. Jagger's staccato delivery is ferociously HOT and Ron & Keith's dual-guitar assault is equally menacing. Their rambunctious vocals provide fun, rollicking support, too. And the take of ""Just My Imagination"" is pushed way over-the-top by Jagger's theatrical vocal contribution (complete with fiery spicy language)! It is the BEST rendition I've EVER heard of this cover tune, having sampled more than a few live versions of ""Just My Imagination"" from various 1978 North American Tour bootleg recordings.

My previous favorite audio from the tour was the ""Out on Bail: 1978 U.S. Tour"" boot, capturing the band in live performance at the Capitol Theatre, Passaic, New Jersey, on June 14, 1978. That one's still a keeper for its raw, unrehearsed quality; I LOVE my live Stones that way! But for everyone else, the DVD audio of this Ft. Worth gig from July 18th, will provide sheer sonic listening pleasure. Both the Dolby Digital 5.1 & the DTS Digital Surround audio are extremely well-done examples of HIGH fidelity sound. The sound is studio-like in its clarity: clear, crisp & crunchy with an astounding dynamic range. The balance in the mix is worthy of mention here, too. Instruments are nicely balanced, guitars have left/right channel separation, and Mick's vocals are upfront without dominating the proceedings too much. Obviously, the music is the main focus throughout so audience reaction (while audible between numbers) is minimized to such an extent --- during the band's playing --- that the listener/viewer is often hard-pressed to even detect the crowd's presence.

All things considered, the most FANTABULOUS aspect of this new DVD release is its ability to place the viewer squarely onstage with The Rolling Stones while they're tearing up the place. You are transported right to the scene of the action and nothing is missed! In fact, instead of a ""you were there"" feeling, we are treated to a ""YOU ARE THERE"" experience. The cumulative effect of the exceptional DVD audio & visuals is that our appreciation for the concert is even GREATER than if we had actually attended the show in the first place. One can ask for nothing more.",1322352000,11,4428,5.158774373259053
4852289,3,B005OGYH9A,"First off, the performance - top notch. The Stones at their ragged, sleazy 70's best, and in fact performing way better and tighter than they would 3 years later on the 1981 North American Tour (at least according to the performances on ""Let's Spend The Night Together"", still my favorite Stones' movie, but their playing was definitely a lot sloppier).  It would've been nice to have some footage of their stadium shows from this tour since it was their first such tour, but this will suffice. It kinda looks like a baby version of ""Shine A Light"", since both were shot in small theaters. And the sound and setlist are both great. Anyone looking for ""Satisfaction"" or a good representation of their 60's hits will be sorely disappointed.  The Stones in the 70's promoted themselves as a 70's band all the way, and that meant they heavily pushed whatever album they were touring behind, plus a smattering of tunes from ""Exile On Main Street"" and their other albums from that decade so far.  In fact, the 60's are only represented by ""Love In Vain"" and ""Jumping Jack Flash"".  Doesn't matter, it's a great concert, no doubt.

As for the picture...I don't know much about video restoration, but couldn't this have been cleaned up a bit more?  Geez, it just looks so washed out and colorless.  Blacks are grey, yellows are white, and everything just looks bleached out and grainy.  Knowing what a great job was done on the ""Led Zeppelin"" DVD (from nearly 9 years ago - a millennium in technological time), how the 1969 concert from the Royal Albert Hall was cleaned up to look like it'd been shot the day before, couldn't this have been put through a similar process to give it a nice detailing job?

The extras are nice.  The ""SNL"" performances are famous more for how bad they were (Jaggers' croaky voice, the band's listless performance) than anything else, but it's a good historical artifact, as is the ""20/20"" piece from 1978.

4852291,5,B005OGYH9A,"If you'd like to open the hood, peer into the engine and see what truly made the Stones a band for the ages (perhaps THE band for the ages), this is the set to get.

I first saw the movie via bootleg and then in a theater this fall, and it is phenomenal. With the CD, this rivals ""Gimme Shelter"" and ""Get Yer Ya Yas"" as their best live product. Throw in ""Ladies and Gentlemen,"" and there is no doubt who had the best band in the land from '69 to '78. Add their output from '62 on, and only the Beatles are as good. This is gargantuan.  No other band comes even close to this accomplishment, and no one else came close over this span of time -- from the early days of 60s rock to the full flowering of punk, standing proud amongst the avatars.

I don't want to spoil any surprises, but about halfway through the lads really start to cook. While it may not be their most spectacular moment, I cannot imagine they were ever tighter or surer (comes with age, I suppose). I found myself thinking that this is how real men rock -- this despite what has to be Mick's most well-documented alpha-dog moment; i suppose it comes with the territory. He is the luckiest front man ever....what a great band, I stand in awe.

Think about it: you have five of the original Stones here (including Ian Stewart, founding member, on the keys), plus two Faces. I'll take this lineup into battle any day. Add in the fact that this is a single concert vs an amalgam of performances, and we may have the winner.

Historical note and another great thing about the video: In the movie, Keef's hair is still '70s elegance, and with his legitimate '70s getup he almost looks beautiful. Cut to the Saturday Night Live performances, and we see the latter-day Keef hairdo, missing only the fishing hooks and other gew-gaws that eventually made their way into his tangled locks. An intriguing transition, and I'm sure I'll glean more bits as I marvel at this amalgam.",1322179200,17,1935,4.408963585434174

The main reason is the performance and sound. The setlist is a personal favourite of mine, and the Blu-Ray picture is more than servicable considering the age and limitations of the film choice. The whole band is really on, and the intimate setting adds to the great vibe and comradery on display. This superb show has the best sound of the Stones on film. The DTS Master Audio is phenominal.

4852297,5,B005OGYH9A,"Outstanding film of the Stones in 78' doing what they do best. Rock'n and rollin'. It's been a long time since I've seen the Stones like this. No horns, no back up singers, no other support than Ian Stuart and another keyboardist. What you hear is Charlie, Keef and Woody just blaring these songs that you know so well. It's new to them (Some Girls stuff) but they are gettin' it over to the crowds with conviction. Jagger is in prime form. I know that most diehard Stones fans claim that the 72' tour was their peak but I beg to differ. That era was primed by coke and speedballs. Although I can't take anything away from Mick Taylor as a beautifully gifted lead guitar player, the songs were rushed and kind of souless in retrospective. Not here in Texas in 78'. The boys have had a few years to relax and become entertainers. The music doesn't appear rushed and feels like it was important for the Stones to provide their audience with a good show. Woody is playing better here than he ever did with the Stones. It's beautiful to see Mick and Keef interact with love and respect like they used to. If you see them today, it's professional and somewhat icy but back in 78' it was obvious that they were very tight. Singing into one microphone is such a rock n' roll thing for the Stones.

The transfer is wonder considering the source. Still lots of streaking in the blacks but the colors are vibrant. Sound is top notch. I've had this bootleg for years on CD (and it was considered an amazing bootleg in its time) and this Blu Ray sounds every bit as good as my boot. Turn it up, tip it back and watch the Stones at their peak! If you are considering picking this up, don't worry, just get it and thank me later. It's an amazing piece of history!",1321920000,11,1749,4.3323170731707314

4852299,5,B005OGYH9A,"I watched the 8MM bootleg videos of this concert on Youtube and loved it. When I found out it was going to be on DVD, I couldn't beleive it. They did a great job editing and digitally enhancing the video. The audio is excellent too. This is my favorite live version of ""Beast of Burden"" that the Stones have released. ""When the Whip Comes Down"" is excellent too. Great DVD!",1321833600,4,373,4.3428571428571425
4852300,5,B005OGYH9A,"Their last American tour (and most neglected) before corporate sponsorship became vogue and in comes this godsend. Gone are the glitz and glamour of the past few tours and the focus is strictly the music. This translates beautifully into video and it shows the punks. They must have realized that ""Some Girls"" was vintage Stones because seven of its ten tracks are represented here and in succession. It was definitely an album meant for the road. Even though the rockers are pretty faithful to the studio renditions, they storm into them with abandon. ""Miss You"" is wondrous as an extended jam and on ""Far Away Eyes"", Mick sits at the piano and the lineup is augmented for this song by a violin/fiddle played by Doug Kershaw. On ""Beast of Burden"" there's a brief moment when Mick and Keith step up to the mic and they make clear this is a show that they truly relish. They seem to have an extrasensory rapport.

They brilliantly reorient their ""Exile On Main Street"" material by stripping the horns and backup vocalists so it will be more integrated with the rest of the music. Most successful in the transformation is Keith's raving rocker, ""Happy"", which showcases his voice in all his ragged glory. ""Star Star"" is another great showpiece. Though Ron Wood might not be as academically adept as Mick Taylor on guitar, he still makes inspired noise. And visually, he's a much more colorful and integral figure on the stage. They're intelligent enough to close this show with their two greatest live staples: ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", still fresh enough to make it a new listening experience.

Maybe the Stones were an institution by this point, but they still had exciting new music and ideas that one wasn't clamoring yet for what they once delivered. Frontman Mick is in exceptional voice throughout and doesn't hog the camera in the least. If you want to know why Charlie Watts is sometimes considered the greatest drummer in rock, this is as good a place as any to find out. The audience is on their feet, a sure sign of a great show. And a great show it is.

P.S. The 2011 interview with Mick and the 1978 Saturday Night Live performance are highlights of the extras.",1321833600,6,2187,4.704960835509138
4852301,5,B005OGYH9A,"There are already quite a few reviews here of the theater version of the film so I won't repeat a lot of that here, except to say that there is a lot of variety in the song selection. You'll hear more about that in the superfine ""bonus features"" which are enough to encourage you to buy the DVD even if you saw the film. And that's what I'm going to concentrate on here.

First off, I can't remember if it was noted that the concert was FILMED (not videotaped) in 16mm and so it is grainy in most spots and the shots of the audience are often dark (not so the music however). So, even though I have not seen the Blu-ray version, I doubt that the image will improve much.

Now on to the bonuses, some of which relates to 1978, when the concert took place. First there is 14-minute one-on-one interview with Mick Jagger done in June 2011. Jagger looks old for the first time (okay it is 33 years after the concert but it is a bit shocking - since I think I last saw him about 3 years ago in an interview). All the questioned revolve around the ""Some Girls"" tour and you'll hear about the set list, the venues and why you don't see the usual security guys in front of the stage. Next comes a 20-minute segment from their 1978 gig on ""Saturday Night Live"", starting off with Jagger doing a skit with Dan Ackroyd (as Tom Snyder), followed by 3 songs by the whole band: ""Beast of Burden"", ""Respectable""- where Mick suns his infamous tongue all over Ronnie Wood's face (on Network TV!) and then ""Shattered"" (where the lyrics are muffled and - since this was a NEW song - the lyrics aren't clear.)  The last bonus feature is a 5-minute profile of the band - with a brief interview - by Geraldo Rivera from a 1978 20/20 episode on ABC-T

A real nice package from Eagle Rock at a fair price.

4852303,5,B005OGYH9A,"In 1978 the Stones individually were in their mid-30's.  The music press having no perspective other than since the Beatles dissolved then the Stones had to be past their shelf-life.  Reviews from the era were in two camps.  The first, the Stones were awesome and only rivaled by perhaps the Who and a couple of other bands on an exceptional evening.  The second, the Rolling Stones were unacceptably old and haggard men at 35 years old.

Live in Texas 1978 mocks those who failed to give the Rolling Stones their due at the time.  What rock n' roll band could leave Ladies and Gentlemen and Live in Texas 1978 in the vaults for all these decades.  There is nothing that surpasses them and would be the crowning jewel of any other band.  The first six songs of this film have been available in bootleg circles for years in hideous video and muddy sound with limited camera views.  The official release is beautiful by comparison.  The performances are great.  Jagger is without peer, and Keith's performance is excellent.  He has returned to the 1969 format of two Chuck Berry numbers to play lead on - though with a thinner sounding Strat.  Keith makes it to the microphone to deliver Happy and plays Tumbling Dice and Jumping Jack Flash in perhaps their best incarnations.  Even Far Away Eyes is good; Ronnie plays well throughout but we miss Mick Taylor's Les Paul on Love in Vain. Instead, Love in Vain because a vocal number.

If you want to know what all the fuss was about pick-up Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones and Live in 1978.  It's not only Rock n' Roll, but Blues, and R&B, and a smidgeon of Country.",1320969600,9,1621,4.576388888888889

4852305,5,B005OGYH9A,"I saw this film by myself at a movie theater recently. The recent interviews with Mick Jagger were fun, and in very soft focus. Seeing the hair styles of the late 70s/early 80s fans was  a hoot. Hopefully more extra material will be added, maybe with Peter Tosh (who opened on this tour) and Mick doing ""Walk and Don't Look Back."" The show itself was very well shot and extremely well recorded. The sound track with its digital mix sounds amazing. Bill and Charlie swing hard and Ronnie really stands out in this performance. Of course its all about the Glimmer twins, and Mick is on fire! The greatest exhibitionist in rock delivers on all 360 fronts. How was he still able to still look so young? And Keith puts in a very game performance. The straight forward band set-up with no gimmicky staging focuses the energy on the players, where it belongs.

I've followed the Stones since the beginning, but can't improve on the eloquence of these other reviewers:this band's passion & commitment are unparalled, plus they do a rampaging ""When the Whip Comes Down"" that'll knock ya flat. As Mick says, ""gonna make ya jump all nite""...this should do it!
  UPDATE: got my copy couple weeks ago; it's actually BETTER than when I saw it in the theater, the sound is pitch-perfect, as some have said, & the ""cinematography"", I guess it is, has long, sustained ""takes""; it's blessedly free of super-fast cuts & shifts a la MTV, THAT's the way to film Rock n' Roll !! And, perhaps ""it's only rock n' roll"", but there 's something exhilerating about watching guys living out their passion: Keith prowls that stage so @ one w/ his music that it's a joy to behold, & yes, Mick is extraordinary, dude is INTO his music, & they take us all with them.

4852307,5,B005OGYH9A,"Everybody knows the story: in 1977-78 faced with the twin perils of punk and disco, and with Keith on bail for trafficing charges, Mick and Keith got serious and wrote some of their best music ever.  Nothing like a crisis to shake off the stuppor of entrenched success.

But then they toured.  They played big arenas and stadiums, and then for some reason they played to 2,500 people in Fort Worth Texas for this show that was filmed.  The show is mythic here in Fort Worth and the video shows why.  No horn section, no backup singers, no inflatables or fireworks, just rock and roll.  And unlike Don Henley or some other rockers from that period, Mick doesn't try to tell us how to vote, ask people to sing along or go into long explanations of why they wrote a particular song.  There is one ""thank you"", one ""you having a good time?"" and one succinct tounge in cheek apology for why the energy was low (it wasn't, but according to Mick's short explanation, their tounges must have been somewhere other than in their own cheek the night before).  Half bragging, but he need not apologise for a lack of energy.  I mean people where whooping it up and clapping their hands to a movie! Oh yeah, Keith and Ronnie share a join on stage, but it doesn't detract from the rock and roll none. They play Tumblin' Dice, Brown Sugar, most of the ""Some Girls' Record, a fair bit of Exile, and a great version of ""Star Star"",  but they played very little from 68 or before except covers.  Oh yeah, they did do one song from '68, ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" which was so upbeat and blistering that I didn't want it to end.  I saw it in the theater two weeks ago, if the DVD is the same, I can watch it over and over. . . it dosn't have to end.

Video from this tour is hard to find.  Other than the SNL performance we had nada but a very bad bootlegged hand cam of 6 songs.  This dvd, if it is the same show they played in the cinemas, is worth owning.  To a Stones fan, the idea of unreleased video (and audio) of the Stones from this period is kinda like a historian finding a heretofore unknown original text of Alexander the Great's thoughts on battle tactics.  ""Oh my God, so that's how they did it"".  But even a casual fan will enjoy this video as it will instantly redeem your blowout game watching party and turn it into a rock and roll party with songs that everybody knows done by men in their mid-thirties who had something to prove in 1978.",1319846400,65,2432,4.284463894967177
4852308,5,B005OGYH9A,"Hidden away in the archives for 33 years, this record of the Stones' ""Some Girls in Texas"" concert is an absolute gem. Playing with a sense of conviction, power, and recklessness that essentially captures the mood of the just released ""Some Girls"" album, the band is in fine form.  Mick's vocals are strong, Keith and relative newcomer Ronnie Wood are in their prime, and Charlie Watts demonstrates once again why he may be the most underrated drummer in rock. Listening to Bill Wyman play bass confirms what I've felt for some time now...the bass lines simply don't sound the same since Daryl Jones took his spot. Bill is unassuming as ever yet his contribution to the Stones' signature sound cannot be overlooked or dismissed.

In contrast to recent Stones' tours, there's plenty of interaction between the band members...particularly Mick and Ronnie...and the stripped-down 1978 edition means a lot of shared-mike vocals with Mick, Keith, and Ronnie occasionally trying to outdo one another. The boys are clearly enjoying themselves yet I couldn't help but get the feeling they were genuinely committed to delivering a great performance.

Ronnie's playing deserves special mention here since we hardly see him cut loose with as many solos anymore. For whatever reason, and there are plenty that come to mind, Mick and Keith seem to keep him under wraps these days and it's a real shame. His style is totally different from Mick Taylor's but Ronnie's lead work on the 1975 and 1978 Tours stand on their own merit.

Plenty of variety here...a couple of Chuck Berry covers, some well-known Stones' classics, eight cuts from the ""Some Girls"" release, which encompasses quite a few musical genres on its' own...the concert is fast, furious, and in-your-face. I'm looking forward to picking up the DVD when it becomes available when I'll be the one to decide just how loud it should be played!",1319241600,35,1890,4.9904761904761905
4852309,5,B005OGYH9A,"Wow, I was really surprised at the quality of the Stones' performance and of the film itself. I had heard horror stories about one of the Colorado gigs on this tour from a good friend (guitar player), and how he said Richards was so out of it he couldn't play, and the only musicians musically ""together"" were Watts and Wyman that night. Prior to curtain time, I just knew this would fall so far below ""Ladies and Gentlemen ..."" Well, I have to blaspheme here - I like it as well as that film - actually, the Stones sound even meaner on this 1978 video. They are much, MUCH better in this 1978 flick than their Saturday Night Live performance from that same year (too much coke and booze with Belushi and Akroyd at SNL?) It's interesting to see and hear how punk rock influenced the Stones in this release. Jagger's vocals are strong, barking and lean; Richards' guitar playing is pushy and bold; and Watts gives what is simply his greatest on-screen performance yet on the drums. He hit the drums really, really hard on this tour. There's still his jazz touch, but his right arm is a weapon in this movie. If only there were more screen time for Watts, Wyman and touring keyboardists Ian Stewart and (ex-Faces member) Ian McLagan. You do see them, but I would have liked to have seen them more. This is a great treasure with clear, edgy mix of instruments and voices. Oh yeah, I'll be picking the DVD/CD version of this up.

But I couldn't help but be impressed with the performance in this film, if this was the Stones proving they were still on top I have to admit they accomplished that.

Ronnie Wood still playing guitar like he meant it instead of mugging and posing, what wouldn't I give to see that again. Keith looked and sounded good, you can see the beginnings of those patented Keef stage moves that later would too often substitute for playing guitar. He must have been clean at this point, every time he and Mick had to meet at one mic to sing together he was there every time right on the beat. Jagger, well what can you say, talk about the hardest working man in show biz. I was surprised at how much guitar he played, and not one costume change, how modest. Charlie was on fire, whip crack energy for the whole show. Bill Wyman looked like it could have been 1969 or 1989, the only thing moving on him were his fingers but he sure was in the groove. Good to see Stu, and Ian McLagan, and no brass section was also a surprise, I didn't realize how stripped-down this tour was. Seeing the primitive (by today's standards) PA setup was funny, and watching Mick climb around in front of the heaps of speakers made me think that must have been what led him to go for bigger stages that would let him dance all over and work the crowd on the sides, no need to put one foot on a roadie's shoulder for balance.

This was the last gasp for the music carrying the show without oversized staging and special effects, maybe it was because the Stones thought they had something to prove but the energy of this concert is amazing.  The people who shot this film had to badger Jagger into letting them do it.  But I can see why at long last Jagger decided to let it out of the vault (apparently they didn't release it back then because they thought they looked too old!), a performance of this caliber does the band great credit.
