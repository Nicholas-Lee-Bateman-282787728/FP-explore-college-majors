3430310,4,B00199PPP6,"I shoulda, coulda , woulda, but didn't?
One of Uma Thurman's best acting jobs.
You have the young  rebellious  teenager who
pictures herself as a ""slut"" and the older version
of a mother with a young daughter. The bond of friendship
between two teen age girls seems as strong as the will to live here.
The choices, ghosts of our decisions that haunt our future
are very cleverly woven into the plot.
A slow and intellectual movie with the flashbacks
replaying over and over until
reality sets the end...",1219190400,,503,4.640449438202247
3430311,5,B00199PPP6,"I haven't seen this film ... but I was going to and was looking forward to it.  Here's why I'm posting this non-review.  I suspect that a review I've read in this section contains a substantial spoiler.  The author may not have intended it as such ... but I'm guessing that it is a spoiler.  Can't say more than that without being a spoiler myself ... except to say that when a reviewer compares any film to a previously released film that had a very unique story format ... well, that can be a real spoiler.  And, if I'm wrong, I apologize.",1219190400,9,541,4.264705882352941
3430312,5,B00199PPP6,"The best analogy I could think of for this beautiful film is Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge meets the Columbine tragedy. The Amazon review covers succinctly what the film contains and I feel any further reviews that shed more light on the details can give away too much. I had not read the book so the entire end sequence was very moving and reminded me exactly what I felt like when I watched OAOCB all those years ago in grade school.

The Blu version was perfect from beginning to end. The opening credits of flowers, skies and insects riveted me immediately once I saw this would be a visual film. All of the night footage and water sequences looked flawless. I can not think of a better film to test your panel display's darks, lights, night motion, water movement, etc.

The special features were quite adequate and provide some decent behind the scenes. The alternate ending was not as earth shattering as it could have been considering how the original one is. If one is into flowers, then I would recommend owning this BD as between the film and the two additional montage pieces on flora - you should be quite pleased. Plenty of chances for screen snaps to save for your display. With the casting tape quip, deleted scenes and commentaries, I consider this to be a solid BD worth owning as the rewatch factor is very high once you experience the ending.",1218844800,7,1363,4.581967213114754

3430341,5,B00199PPP6,"A boy walks into a school with a gun, leaves devastation and desolation where once there was bountiful life.  No closure is to be gained from his selfishness.  However, there can be life after the rain.

Whose life?  That is the question the teenager poses to two girls caught in the eye of his storm.

He stumbles onto two best friends who have already shared a wold of experiences and coming to age and about to outgrow the uncertainties of high school.  Diana and Emma.

Diana and Emma make a fateful stop in the girls' room on their way to class and talk about life now and in the future.  Then they hear gunshots outside the door.  Soon after, the gunman stumbles upon them.  He had meticulously gone from room to room shattering lives.

He gives the girls a choice as to whom should be killed.

Who chose to die? Who actually lived?

Great cinematography and acting were born.

Only one thing for sure, there is life after the rain.",1442361600,,938,4.4411764705882355

3430343,4,B00199PPP6,"I rented this movie because I had just read the book.  I wondered how the creators would achieve the sureal psychological flavor of the novel but I have to say that did a truly excellent job, this movie is just as beautiful and confusing as the book as is as we struggle to understand what is happening to Diana, played by Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood (the young Diana).  Just like the book you stay riveted, thinking you know what is going on but you have no idea until the end comes and blows your mind.  I loved this movie!  An amazing adaptation of a really wonderful novel, which is not easy to do, and I wouldn't have thought possible with a book like this.  The acting is superb, I was especially impressed with Uma, wow.  Highly recomend this one whether you've read the book or not, you'll enjoy it.",1438646400,,812,4.344370860927152

3430348,4,B00199PPP6,"Although it was a beautifully filmed movie and the main characters were portrayed superbly by excellent actresses, this film was a bit hard to comprehend while watching it. It kept flashing back and forwards to the teenage girls and the adult ""supposed"" survivor with the successful life, husband and unruly child (whom in turn acted out just like she did as a child, but at a younger age.) There were many hints and odd statements that contributed to the whole climax near the end of the movie. I had to read some of the reviews after viewing to help understand it. Several reviewers stated the film should be watched again and you would find more answers easily and understand it easier. The film was pretty good, I did enjoy it. But you really had to pay attention to figure it all out. I would like to read the book now and see if the book was a lot easier to understand. Most of the time, I believe, when books are made into movies a lot of the quality of the storyline is lost. Maybe that's what happened here ...........You have to watch the movie to see what you think.....",1434499200,,1081,4.437185929648241

3430350,4,B00199PPP6,"I think this movie held me spell bound! That doesn't mean I liked the ending though. Still, I would say it was extremely well done and well thought out. I like the originality of the writer's plot. I think the recreation of the dramatic movie scenes, the way they were replayed, lent much to the fantastic horror the viewer begins to feel as the movie progresses. I mean, the loss in this movie becomes very personal. The friendship between the two besties is palpable and so realistic. It made me miss my own best friend, the one I lost in moving far away, long ago. The acting is simple but it is realistic. The characters are completely believable. So it's a bit of a stretch that the best friends are completely opposite, but I can buy it. It happens. This movie and the emotions it provoked stayed with me long after it was over. I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1432944000,,865,4.481012658227848

This movie is not intended for 'mass' consumption. It is intended to be thought-provoking; appealing specifically to audiences who enjoy being 'entertained' on a much higher/deeper level and who can appreciate film as an artful piece of work. This was not meant to be some generic blockbuster 'hit' movie. It is different; more on par with a good indie movie.

3430374,5,B00199PPP6,"I really enjoyed this film, as well as the book. I feel it was not given the good ratings it deserved. It is full of symbolism and questions as to what is real and what is conscience speaking. You don't know what the true ending will be- suspenseful. Also a relevant story for these troubled times of so many school shootings. Both actresses playing the main character were excellent.

I can't explain it but I've watched it a couple of times.  If you enjoy the movie as I did you will watch it again also. Important - if you purchase the DVD as opposed to watching it on Netflix or such, DO NOT watch the special features until after you have watched the movie.",1408406400,,519,4.049019607843137

3430387,1,B00199PPP6,Very odd. Only slightly entertaining in the beginning. It was as if the screenwriter didn't know what to do with a story he had not thought out very well.

3430388,5,B00199PPP6,"This is a movie you should watch! A stellar cast, haunting score and visually stunning and dynamic camera-work, all combine to take this subject matter and lift it high. You'll be tempted to think you know exactly what kind of movie it is, i.e. set against the backdrop of a school shooting (and isn't THAT a tasteless subject, yada, yada, yada...no! It's done well.) it follows two young teenage girls who become hostage to the teen killer... flashbacks ensue from the present, as one of the girls, now grown, married and a mother herself, approaches the 15th anniversary of the shooting... it would be a gripping taut storyline just on those lines - well-told with good dialog and cinematography, but... there's more!

3430396,3,B00199PPP6,This movie was just OK. Uma Thurman as a mother just didn't work for me.

3430403,4,B00199PPP6,"This film is not about the killer. It is about the survivor, if there is one. Although the scenes with the killer are intense and hook you right into the beginning of the movie, there is no explanation to his senseless motivation.

The story begins with two very different girls. One is a straight-up, church-going, family oriented student. The other is not doing so well in school, making some not so wise life choices. Yet the friendship between them is pure convincing chemistry. In the moment that they are faced with deciding who is going to die, there is what I believe to be the proverbial life flashing before her eyes.

This is not an easy story to follow, partly because of the flashbacks, but also because the story does not unfold in a simple direct way. This leaves the movie open to your own interpretations as to what is going on. Not everyone will appreciate this challenge. I struggled with it the first time I saw it, but decided to watch it again. I am glad I did, and those who are patient enough to see it again will catch different things the second time around.",1397952000,,1084,4.49746192893401
3430404,4,B00199PPP6,"This is not a film, it is a pictorial essay of the horror of armed trespassers into the sanctity of American schools; I say sanctity because schools are temples of knowledge, wisdom; predatory assassination is never taught here. I gave it 4 Stars because is not a well rounded treatise of the problem, it leaves out solutions to minimize the epidemic malady such as the posting of armed guards or arming teachers, I would go as far out as suggesting the arming of volunteer students. I am truly sick of the authorities not taking serious measures against this devastating and growing problem. Remember: ""The only one who can take down a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun"".

Laura Kasischke wrote the novel in which the film is based, great job. Some viewers did not understand the back and forth format of the story telling, it made perfect sense' it is the mind of a woman that when was a teenager is confronted by a gunman who executes her best friend Eva Amurri (Maureen)  right in front of her. The woman played by Uma Thurman (Diane), and her younger counterpart played masterfully by Evan Rachel Wood, suffers from flashbacks that ultimately and sadly cost her everything, her marriage, daughter and career.

The two girls are confronted by the assassin in the girls bathroom, many in the audience do not understand who dies, Diane or Maureen, great movie, Diane smokes pot, dates a professor, skips classes and yet manages to control her grades, her friend Maureen is religious and tries to conduct her life by virtuous standards. They both died, one immediately, the other one lives agonizingly for another twenty years and then dies, we don't know if physically or mentally, on the school's 20th year memorial of the tragic day.

Vadim Perelman does a brilliant direction of a complicated story; in actuality, the movie is masterful, complex, intrincate and difficult to grasp, perhaps even has to be watched  a few times to fully understand it and cherish it regardless of its morbid content,  one we have to understand to properly deal with the horror of school shootings that affects us all, directly or indirectly. I sincerely recommend this film to everybody and suggest its viewing is compulsory as it may help us understand better the victims and the apocalyptic times in which we are living.",1397606400,,2318,4.7825
3430405,5,B00199PPP6,Well written and directed. It all comes together at the end and loved all the tie-ins. The movie goes in and out showing the child's life and then her as an adult and is done perfectly! This is a powerful movie. A must see.,1397520000,,223,4.090909090909091

I sort of agree with what Uma Thurman says in her interview on the special features after the movie.  She did not care for the twist.  Nor did I.  But I only looked at the movie once.  To me this movie could have been a great psychological thriller without the twist.  It would have made logical sense and there would have been a very good explanation for the problems of the adult character Diane( to say too much about this would be a spoiler).  But with the twist the movie has some holes in it.  But viewers need to make their own assessment.  Do you want it to be a supernatural fantasy or a realistic exploration into a real life drama and the results of a life or death choice?  I would have given it 5 stars as a realistic movie without the twist.  The twist made the whole movie watching experience (for me) a disappointment.  Everything tied together so well without it.  I said to myself at the ending What the hell - this movie makes no sense and then it dawned on me what was done and I saw it as a bad choice.  But only after looking at the special features did i fully realize what they had done and why.  And even then i only really got it after hearing the interview of the young character Emma.  I would like to see it redone as a real drama without showing the choice made in the school bathroom.  I will say they did a good job hiding the twist and the hints weren't really apparent, which had to be tricky, and thus the potholes in the plot.  This could actually be two different movies - it all hinges on what choice is made at one point in the movie.",1333411200,,1686,4.154320987654321
3430438,4,B00199PPP6,"The Life Before Her Eyes is not a movie you are going to like if you like the writers, directors and everyone else involved to conclude the story for you and wrap everything up in a nice little package so once the credits roll you know exactly what happened.  It's in fact the complete opposite.  You're going to know some things in the final on screen moments, but what you do find out actually asks even more questions.  So therefore it's not a movie you want to rent or buy to watch alone, because the discussion afterwards is the whole point of watching the movie.  There's a lot of little scenes in the movie that people with various opinions can state were clues to their own theories, but there's nothing conclusive to provide right or wrong opinions and that's the fun of this type of movie.  This would make an ideal film for a school class to watch where the teacher then asks them to write what they think happened.  Or a book club type group to watch individually then discuss together the next time they meet.  It's a confusing movie sure, but it does have some excellent acting.  Basic plot revolves around a student shooting up his classmates.  Two teenagers Diana and Maureen have decided to touch up their makeup and be late for class which may have saved their lives. But suddenly the gunboy enters the bathroom and since for some reason neither seems to take the obvious option of simply jumping him even when the gun is unloaded while changing cartridges, it looks like at least one of them isn't going to make it, unless they can convince the boy otherwise.

It's hard to write the next part without giving away some sort of plot spoilage so be aware of that if you choose to read on. Although the acting is brilliant, I'm not sure if you'd say it was well cast as the two different Diana's don't really look like a younger and older version of the same person.  But then maybe, they're not supposed to be playing that?  As one of the questions raised is what was Uma Thurman actually supposed to be?  Was she simply a grown up version of Diana who survived?  Was she a ghost?  Was she just a traumatic imagination of the younger Diana as her potential life flashes before her eyes?  Was she sort of playing Diana's mother with Uma scenes in fact being child hood flashbacks where the young girl Emma was really Diana, and Uma Thurman being the replay version of her mum where Diana puts herself in her mothers place with those events? Was Uma really playing Diana or was she the best friend Maureen, now grown up who had decided she should live life to the full since you never know when it may be your last by emulating the way her friend lived up that point in all ways such as taking on her name, and naming her daughter Emma, the name that Diana had claimed when Maureen suggested it as a constant reminder of her best friend?

This movie is based on a novel by Laura Kasischke.  I haven't read it, so don't know if it has a vague an overall feeling at the end or actually outlines what the whole thing was about.  The version of DVD I watched didn't have any special features but apparently there is one with a director's commentary which may clear some things up.  I think it's better to not know the director's interpretation of the novel's story and a lot more fun to simply discuss it with your friends who have seen it.",1314403200,3,3351,4.409090909090909

3430441,4,B00199PPP6,"The Life Before Her Eyes is one of the more thought-provoking movies I've ever seen.  It's not necessarily a suspense, and it's definitely not a horror (like someone originally told me).

It's about two teenage girls who find themselves in a school bathroom carrying on a conversation and minding their own business, when suddenly they freeze in their tracks the moment they realize there's gunshots taking place outside the room in the hallways, and quickly realize there's a shooter in the building.  The shooter enters the bathroom and says one of the girls is going to die.

From here, the plot kicks in.  Now let me explain the storyline because it's sort of confusing at first.  There's two themes running for the rest of the movie.

One of them concerns one of the girls as a grown woman 15 years later -all grown up with a family of her own- and having her own personal issues pertaining to the school tragedy that took place 15 years earlier.  This particular theme deals with the woman staying oddly quiet as she remembers the anniversary of the tragedy.  Her memories reflect the depressing tone of the atmosphere, and interfere with her family's life.  Her young daughter becomes the center of attention numerous times because she struggles in school and misbehaves all the time.

The other theme is the woman constantly thinking back to her teenage years merely days before the shooting incident took place, which means we actually see her as a teenager having fun with her best friend.  This theme isn't as good as the other one in my opinion because it's very slow-moving and doesn't provide anything substantial.

So the film constantly switches between these two storylines.  It can get a bit confusing after a certain point (like 50 minutes in) so make sure you continue to keep up with the events taking place.

Now, as you can probably guess, there is a major twist coming at the end.  I obviously won't spoil what happens.  It's good though, and probably the reason I'm giving this film a 4-star rating instead of a more deserving 3.

One unintentionally frightening moment is when the woman takes her daughter to a restaurant and something happens that felt a little too realistic for my liking.  This segment was probably not created with the intention to strike such a strong personal reaction out of the viewers, but it did so anyway.

It's not a film for anyone except those with a lot of patience and a desire to stay tuned to see what happens at the end.  It's good but it has its weak moments as well, particularly whenever the story focuses on the girls teenage years.",1295308800,,2598,4.716186252771618

Over eight years later, I plop in the DVD I rented and feel like I've heard this story before.  A light bulb goes on when I realize that I read the book.  My first thought was, ""I don't think I liked it.""  I've got to say that I liked the film MUCH better than the book.  The meandering details of the book are distilled into distinct visual images in the film.  Uma Thurman is intense and riveting.  Rachel Evans Ward is beautiful and gives us a flavor of this person.  Although, I do still agree with the lowly-rated reviews that I've read here because of the difficulty of the subject matter and how the entire story comes down to memory and projection vs. reality, the film takes the potentials that were in the book and works them more successfully.  I enjoyed watching the screen test of Eva Amurri in the DVD extras and see how well she auditioned for the role.  John Magaro gives a haunting performance as the troubled killer Michael Patrick.  While I probably won't add this to my DVD collection for repeated rainy day viewings, I enjoyed seeing a film improve on the original work.  Enjoy!",1292457600,2,1185,4.46046511627907
3430444,5,B00199PPP6,"Given the number of puzzled viewers I thought it might be helpful to just pull together some messages I have left in answer to various questions on the IMDb message board. I found it more interesting than any film I have watched over the past few years. But I like off-kilter philosophical stuff that merits repeat viewings and gives the brain cells some challenging exercise. And I like adaptations that improve upon their source novels. I like Evan Rachel Wood visually and as an actress. I like carefully crafted films where the director, the production designer, and the editor have obviously been in sync and have created a synergy between the elements; where almost every detail has a purpose and there is not a lot of throw away fluff padding the running length or trying to expand the target audience.

  I can offer a few comparisons for prospective viewers; overall it is probably closest to ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) so if you are a fan of that film I can almost guarantee that you will connect with this one. In style, Director Vadim Perelman reminds me a great deal of Atom Egoyan; so if you hated ""Exotica"", ""Where the Truth Lies"", or ""The Sweet Hereafter"" you would be wise to give ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" a wide berth. The story itself is a blend of ""Home Room"" and Donnie Darko (2001); with the match cut editing of ""The Hours"" (2002) linking three separate timelines together. Philosophically it blends the existential themes of ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""The Wages of Fear"" (1953), but I've not yet seen anyone else make this comparison.

  STOP!!! If you haven't seen it yet stop here, watch the film, come back and read the rest, and then watch it again. Don't read any further unless you are prepared for spoilers.

  The only scene that takes place in the present is the scene in the rest room. The other stuff is either Diana's flashbacks to her growing friendship with Maureen, or Diana's imagined future flashing before her eyes as she tries to make a decision. The flashbacks show viewers the process of Diana becoming less selfish and more responsible; a maturing that greatly complicates her decision.

  I was not as blown away after seeing the film for the first time as I am now, although I bought into the friendship dynamic completely. I like it a little better each time I view it (including watching it with the commentary special feature turned on). Much of it is expressionism, which we don't see much in American films, so it takes a while to really connect with the stuff. And that requires you to let go of the plot and just go with the style and the theme, something easier to do ""after"" the first viewing. Everything is a literary device and getting caught in a plausibility trap will prevent you from making the connection needed to really go beneath the surface of the story.

  The really incredible thing to me is how uniquely it explores the implications of friendship/conscience. There are rewards to friendship but also obligations (responsibilities) and if you don't feel these, then you are mistaking friendship for something much shallower. Diana's life essentially becomes a Hobson's choice; between something and nothing. And the viewer gets to watch as Wood nonverbally conveys the process of her character slowly coming to that realization. The ""life before her eyes"" becomes nothing once she understands the implications of that option.

  The film is all about point of view, everything is being seen from Diana's POV except for the rest room scene which is from the audience point of view; where the actress Wood is communicating nonverbally with viewers in about the best acting sequence you are likely to ever witness. She is simultaneously flashing back to events in her friendship with Maureen and to parallel events in her imagined future.

  Essential to understanding this process (and the film) is to recognize that she and Maureen have already spent a lot of time together imagining each others' futures; and that these times are central to Diana's thoughts and decision-making process in the rest room.  The thing to remember about Diana's ""imagined"" life is that it is connected to the ""real"" events in the rest room, and is correctly sequenced (the imagined events themselves occur in their correct order - they progress). All lead up to the point where the imagined Diana says: ""I have to go"". You think it means that she has decided to attend the memorial service, but what it actually means is that the real Diana has just decided that she is the one who has to die. These two decisions are just one decision, and in a similar fashion the other real events in the rest room link to events in her imagined future (illustrating the Paul Gogan theme - the lack of much demarcation between what is real and what is imagined). This connection is the most interesting detail of the scripting although I doubt if many even notice it during the first viewing.

  I think that the key sequence (which I only really picked up on during a later viewing) is when they are walking together on the sidewalk as the lawn sprinkler showers them with mist. The sequence is repeated later for emphasis. During this Maureen talks about how she used to watch flowers in a heavy rain. Telling Diana how the rain will crush the flowers, yet amazingly ""some"" of them are able to recover and bloom again as if nothing had happened. Diana flashes back to this and it is central to her decision. She believes that if she is killed instead of Maureen, that it will crush Maureen but that she will recover and bloom again. She contrasts this to the life she is imagining for herself if she allows Maureen to be killed, and the result is reflected in the crushed, decayed, and withered flowers that are symbolically shown in the later scenes of her imagined future.

  Also note the scenes where Diana is searching for Emma. What the director and production designer are trying to communicate in those scenes is that the real Diana has already been shot and her imaginary future is unraveling. Watch what happens to the necklace the adult Diana is wearing in the woods (falling in the water in the woods coincides with the young Diana falling into the water that is pooling on the rest room floor), her necklace has broken and the stones are hanging in the same pattern the bullets made on the young Diana's chest.

  There is a director's commentary on the DVD, in which he takes you through every clue and symbolic reference in his film.

Think about it, how would you like to have to make that choice?  Then, of course the movie ""Sophie's Choice"" popped into my head, and the Columbine school shooting.  Believe me, there was way too much information going on in this movie to be a last second thought, i.e. the abortion, the daughter waiting in the hallway while the nun told Diana she was a troubled child, the dead hawk with ants covering it, the cougar in the cage and the daughter saying ""cougar"" in a child's game while driving in the car, the husband asking if she was alright and her touching the ""worry dolls"" and saying I have to keep it together this week.  Then there is the conversation with Maureen saying Diana knew who the shooter was and he ""Mike"" was going to bring a gun to school and kill everyone.  How would you like to live with that guilt?  I also dismissed the song ""She's Not There"" as a period in Diana's life with the older fellow that she did not want to be reminded of, so she turned the radio off.  I deviated away from the director's meaning, in the second bathroom scene.  When the shooter asks, ""Come on girls, time to choose"" and Maureen says, ""if you're going to kill one of us, kill me"" and they break hands.  Nice touch by the way.  But, it might have worked better if we heard Diana say the same words in the beginning not the end.

Based on the novel by Laura Kasischke, ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" is a melancholic tale of a woman who survives a horrific, Columbine-type massacre while in high school, only to be haunted by the experience for the rest of her life.

Half of the film focuses on her life today, fifteen years after the event, as Diana struggles to be a good wife and mother amid painful memories she is unable to put behind her; the other half recounts the days leading up to and including the tragic event, when she was basically just a typical rebellious teen, uninterested in school and chafing against life in a small town, dreaming of the day when she would be able to move on to bigger and better things, unaware, as we all are, of just how easily our lives and dreams can be shattered at a moment's notice.

Screenwriter Emil Stern flows seamlessly back and forth between the two time periods, providing a spellbinding look at the devastating effect trauma and survivor's guilt can have on the human psyche, the permanent damage they can cause.  You'll have to decide for yourself whether the ""Carnival of Souls""/""Sixth Sense"" -type ending works or not (I happen to think it does), but either way, this is an incisive and thought-provoking work that can be interpreted on many levels. (It also explains why the Zombies' ""She's Not There"" seems to be playing everytime someone turns on a radio).

Uma Thurman portrays Diana as she is today, while Evan Rachel Ward plays her as a restless teen, and both are excellent, as is Eva Amurri as her best friend in school.  Vadim (""The House of Sand and Fog"") Perelman's direction is artful, lyrical and hypnotic, and James Horner's haunting score sets just the right tone for this strange little mood piece that will have you thinking long and hard about your own life and the importance of living in the moment.",1284595200,5,1856,4.677914110429448
3430449,5,B00199PPP6,"The astonishing aspect of this film - based (spoiler alert) on a dream - is its shear realism.  One must admire a writer and film-maker who unflinchingly portray the emotional trauma of abortion.  The fearless portrayal of a young girl being sexually exploited by an older ""boyfriend"", who uses drugs with her, gets her pregnant, and then forces her to have an abortion - and her resultant demoralization - undergird the film.  Certainly, the stark horror of a Columbine-style massacre is the deus ex machina at the fulcrum of the story, but the moral failures and loose sexuality of the main character, Diane (played to agonized perfection by Rachel Wood when a teenager and Umma Thurman as an adult) are what this film is all about.

Consider ""Emma"" - the ""daughter"" of the older Diane.  The name ""Emma"" shows up at various points in the film.  ""Emma"" is a favorite name for young Diane, a name she would call her child were she to have one.  She sees this name on a memorial cross (among many such little crosses) on a church lawn commemorating the innnocent victims of abortion (after Diane has paid her grisly visit to a ""women's clinic""), and is crestfallen.  At the end of the film, Diane's older self runs panicking into the dark, misty woods, vainly in search of Emma, but her daughter is apparently lost forever.  Emma is the daughter which Diane never had, and over which she agonizes up until the last moment of the film.

Other themes appear, and then reappear, throughout the film, but they all relate to Diane's termination of her pregnancy.  Diane imagines the mist from evaporating water to contain lost souls.  This mist appears, and then reappears, at various times: while walking with her Christian soul-mate (Maureen, in a deeply humane performance by Susan Sarandon's daugher, Eva Amurri) after the abortion, while searching for her lost daughter in the woods, and again, during the very last scene where one is forced into uncomfortable conclusions about the true meaning of the film.

Another theme relates to the idea of the human conscience, how it informs one in making correct decisions in life, and the perils of ignoring its lessons.  Again, this film is not about a geeky, evil clown mowing down kids with a machine gun; it's about Diane, the life choices she made, and their consequences.

The performances (by the women, Thurman, Amurri, and - particularly Ms. Wood) are utterly affecting and convincing.  The music and cinematography build somber moments, interspersed with tense (and, at times, graphic) violence, that are well paced and thoroughly engrossing.  The characters are given time to develop, and the viewer is given time to ponder the narratives and their relationship to (what appears to be) the main story.

The screenplay presents a somewhat morbid puzzle but it invites ruminations on life - and death - which will challenge, and haunt, the viewer long after the credits have rolled.",1280793600,9,2934,4.9048582995951415
3430450,5,B00199PPP6,"This is a wonderful movie and one that should be seen more than once ~ it leaves the person watching, lost at the end unless they really followed the meaning behind the movie ~ it was really spiritual and thought provoking ~ we loved it.",1277164800,,237,4.288888888888889
3430451,2,B00199PPP6,"I usually like these kinds of flicks because the viewer needs to get to the end before they find out if they were viewing a dream, a pre-death hallucination or whatever. When I got to the end of this one I felt cheated.

Uma Thurman plays the adult version of a girl who is polar opposites to another girl who is her high school buddy. The two are in the high school ladies room when a Columbine type shooting spree starts. The shooter finds them in the bathroom and says he will blow away one of them. So which one gets it? You follow Uma through part of her adult life and the movie flashes back to various episodes of the two during high school.

Uma was the wild one of the pair but grows up to have what seems to be an interesting and fulfilling adult life, complete with loving husband and somewhat troublesome daughter. But she's haunted by what happened that day and cannot escape it. So the question remains throughout, 'what happened that day.'

I'm not going to spoil anything but, when I found out what happened, it seemed like so much rubbish. I cannot say what the human mind might come up with under those circumstances but I did not believe it. It was too elaborate. Too real. Too nuanced. I'm not even convinced her character could come up with those things if she had all kind of time to figure it out.

The performances, production, direction and music are all above board. Whether or not you like this movie will depend on what happens when you get to the punchline. And by then, it'll be too late. For my money, the ride wasn't worth the fare.",1276473600,,1564,4.364261168384879
3430452,3,B00199PPP6,"I was really curious about this movie, because the things that I had read about it made it sound like a winner.  A type of intriguing thriller, and that would have been definitely my kind of movie.  But unfortunately, this movie keeps on building itself up in a very promising manner only to completely fall flat on its own face toward the end.  The problem was that I didn't understand what this end was supposed to mean.  At first, I thought that it meant that Diana had been a ghost, and was reliving the experiences of her past life.  But it was only when I read one of these posted reviews that clarified things for me.

(BEWARE SPOILER PART)

Actually what had happened toward the end was that Diana, when confronted by the high school mate from her math class with the machine gun, was thinking in those precious moments what her life could have been like, had she and her friend not been shot that day in the bathroom of their high school.  That was something that I hadn't really considered, and it seems strange in retrospective that a person when confronted to face death would start thinking for such an extensive amount of time what their life could have been like had it not been for the atrocious shoot out at their high school.

When I was watching this movie, I was expecting a very different kind of end.  I thought that since the friendship of the 2 girls was on the brink of failure that somehow maybe Diana's friend had had a hand in the high school shoot out, but that her accomplice turned against her.  After all this was supposed to be a thriller, at least that's what I read about on the net before people gave their comments here on Amazon.
Anyway, if you're an avid thriller fan like me, you probably won't like the ending because there is no real suspense in it.  And it should be said that this is not a thriller but rather a kind of drama with perhaps a message for the audience.  I guess the message would imply that you should live your life to the fullest because it can be over in a heartbeat.  Maybe, that's the message, or maybe there's more to it than that, and I didn't recognize it. At any rate the movie is really something for fans of the drama type of movies, and those who like flashbacks, for me those were overdone; I mean you get that bathroom scene probably something like 7-8 times in this movie, and that just too much, especially as it only inches onward every time!  Still this movie could haven been so much better with a better more suspenseful and intriguing end.  Maybe the book was much better, as some reviewers pointed out, and the filmmakers to too much liberty in changing parts of the story line.",1265068800,,2658,4.404907975460123

3430456,5,B00199PPP6,"The Life Before Her Eyes is a treasure.

Based on a novel by Laura Kasischke, it stars Uma Thurman as Diana ""Dee"" McFee, a teacher in a small New England town. Diana is married and has a daughter who shows signs of being as unmanageable as she, herself, was as a teen.

We get to see exactly how wild she was in flashbacks, with the marvelous Evan Rachel Wood perfect as the young Diana. (Wood as the young Thurman? Brilliant and inspired casting). We get to see the shape of her life then in order to compare it to her life as an adult. And we also get to see the horrible tragedy that haunts her as an adult and threatens her happiness, and even her sanity.

The story is powerfully moving, adapted to the screen by Emil Stern. The alternation between the past and present is graceful, and both actresses give amazing performances of real depth and feeling, without veering into melodrama. Director Vadim Perelman (House of Sand and Fog) and cinematographer Pawe' Edelman provide lyrical visuals full of lovely everyday images potent, but not over-stuffed, with symbolism.

The Life Before Her Eyes is a wise film with a lot to say about life, the things we hold sacred, who we are at the best and worst of times, and the impact a few moments can have on eternity.",1252886400,2,1266,4.491304347826087

Diana sleeps around, skips school and aparently cares about nothing, while Maureen is more subdued in every way.  Until one day their class mate pulls out the gun in the school yard, starts shooting at students and teachers and at that moment changes everyone's lives.

Filmed as a flashback between Diana's young teenage life and her adult life as a mother, professor and a wife, it is a story that goes back and forth between past and present.  It is almost that everything in Diana's life triggers some emotion or  memory fromher distant past.  One would think that 15 years after the fateful event of school shooting, Diana will be a well adjusted woman, but that is not a case.

She seems to want to redeem her choices made in her youth with the life she lives in her present.  Until her seemingly well ordered life falls into pieces all at once and unexpectedly.  Are such horrific events going to free her from her conscience, or take away a little bit of a sanity that is left in her?  You watch the movie and then be the judge.",1251158400,,1102,4.465

I came away from it absorbed in it's overwhelming visual beauty, and initially confused, by it's conclusion.

I highly recommend paying attention to the subtle clues, sprinkled throughout the film.
If you do so, the ending will have even more of an emotive impact.
Although the story revolves around two best friends, portrayed in a series of flashbacks & present day, the foundation of it presents the viewer with the idea of being faced with crucial, life altering decisions, and how a split decision can haunt one person for a lifetime.
The film, subconsciously, plays on our own choices.
What would or wouldn't one do, if faced with similar circumstances?
The acting is exceptional, and the dreamlike current of the film, sort of conveys that all is not as it seems.

I don't get it and I was so mad when it ended. Because if the other one lived then it would have been her life they were showing.

The DVD: Fantastic quality, definitely worth getting the Blu-Ray version because of all of the beautiful filming, it's unlike other movies out there. The Special Features aren't very exciting, however, the film itself makes up for the lack of extras, trust me.

Uma Therman does a great job with the role of the grown-up Diana, definitely testing her dramatic skills. The role of young Diana is played by Evan Rachel Wood who carries the weight of the movie on her shoulders and does a great job with it.

3430465,5,B00199PPP6,"This film stirs the soul as deeply as a fine symphony.  The central character is an artist and teacher, Diana McFee, played at two junctures in her life by Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood.  The adult Diana is haunted by the mistakes she made in her dissolute youth.  The film deftly handles the flashbacks that allude to this point, with the linchpin a Columbine-like shooting that ends in a confrontation between the rampaging student and Diana and her solidly grounded best friend Maureen.  A fine performance can almost be taken for granted from Thurman, and she delivers here without breaking a sweat.  But Wood was a revelation.  Her young Diana as a teen languishing in a sense of moral futility was deeply affecting.  Of equal note is Eva Amurri as Maureen, the best friend with whom Diana shares that pivotal moment.  This film is too humble an achievement in the cacophony of Hollywood hoopla to draw much attention to these performances, but they are definitely all noteworthy.  In fact, the entire supporting cast should be commended, as every scene seems carved out of cool jade.

The cinematography is an essential part of this movie.  Though Diana as a teen and as an adult is chronically confused, her melancholy blends into an almost paradisaical richness in the air.  It begins with insects dreamily alighting in a lush garden, color and life humming on her periphery, an idyllic refuge that is perhaps appreciated by Diana only in retrospect.  The look of the film is unquestionably part of its point, and therefore the Blu-ray should be the first choice in viewing this one.  This is an exquisite film of emotional purity.  I was left pondering it for days.

Evan Rachel Wood portrays Diana, a wild girl who relishes using bad language and meting out her own brand of justice, while her best friend Maureen, played by Eva Amurri, serves as the moral compass.  While blithely enjoying their day, the two hole up in the school bathroom, chatting and fixing their makeup -- and then shots ring out.

From this point forward, the movie plays out in a series of flash-forward, flashback vignettes -- we see the two girls swimming, diving, hanging out; and then we see the adult version of Diana, taking her daughter Emma to school, glancing nervously at a sign over the local high school announcing a 15-year memorial of the tragedy -- a haunting day when a boy fired into a school, destroying lives.

Several versions of the teenage girls' final moments are played out, with the killer asking them to choose which one will die.

What seems like a normal life for the adult version of Diana soon has us asking several questions:  Which girl actually died on that fateful day?  What constitutes reality and what is actually fantasy?  Is everything only a flashing of ""life before her eyes"" and is nothing real at all?

It's always risky to watch a movie made from a book you liked, and I did like the book version of the story quite a bit...it was lyrical and dreamy and morally challenging. The film, for some reason, inserted a weird narrative about abortion, which was not part of the original story. It also made Maureen, the best friend, a Christian virgin. So of course the whole thing becomes a religious morality play, whereby the bad girl chooses to die to make up for the life she took. Yuck. The book had none of that nonsense. And in fact, the (anti-)heroine made quite a different choice in the book, which offered a completely different twist on the ""choose life"" thing--in the book the grown-up Diana sees a bumper sticker with that saying on it--the person who wrote the screenplay obviously noticed that and decided to make it more of a propaganda piece, instead of a morally ambiguous fable.

I didn't really like the movie, I'm not an Uma Thurman fan at all, but I would like to read the book to see if it'll explain in greater detail.

The Life Before Her Eyes tells the story of young Diana, a reckless, wild teenager who seems to not have a care in the world and her best friend Maureen, a timid, religious girl who instantly bonds with the wild child one day at school and they became strong friends. Then one day, while in the bathroom at school, a student comes with a loaded gun and begans to shoot down students before making his way into the bathroom and holds the gun to them saying ""which one of you is going to die?"". Fast forward and Diana is now a mother and wife, who finds her life beginning to steadily break down on the fiftenth aniversary of the shooting, where her actions in the past come back to haunt her.

The film, like Atonement, makes use of the surreal imagery, the director bathing everything in soft sunlight, giving it an almost dream like quality to it all, letting ordinary things like water, food, buildings, flags, everything just come alive, making every detail almost as important as the characters. Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood are both superb in the roles of Diana and Eva Amurri is another standout as the best friend.

The pacing of the film goes by at a brisk but not rush paced, giving just enough time for every character to grow and develop, which all leads up to such an ending that it demands an instant reveiwing of the film, where you begin to notice even more things you might have missed in the first and finding out the little hints that may indicate to what may happen.

Before you hold too tightly to that proposition, consider the title of the movie.

My advice is this: focus on the bathroom scene dialog that takes place in bits and pieces throughout the film, horrifying as it might be. The killer sets the rules -- one of the two girls will die. Pay attention to the one who volunteers first and look at her motives. Watch the affect of that decision on the other girl (our heroine) and watch her work through the possible outcomes. Who will have the better life if allowed to live? Then understand her plea to the gunman.

3430487,4,B00199PPP6,"Laura Kasischke's intelligent novel 'The Life Before Her Eyes' has been brilliantly adapted for the screen by Emil Stern, and with the skills of director Vadim Perelman, this underrated movie in the theaters may find a wider appreciative audience in this DVD format. It is a film that challenges the viewer to think, to piece together the evidence, and to come to personal conclusions about the meaning of the story.

Diana (Evan Rachel Wood in an outstanding performance) is a 'loose girl' in her highschool who happens to be best friends with her total opposite, the moralistic virgin Maureen (Eva Amurri). While sharing thoughts and gossip in the school's bathroom they hear gunshots and rapidly become victims of a wild student's killing spree, terrorizing the school.  The killer enters the bathroom, asks the girls to decide which one of the two will volunteer to die, gunshots blaze and we see Diana lying on the floor of the bathroom while Maureen shrinks beneath the sinks: the last gunshots are apparently the killer committing suicide.

Flash forward 15 years and Diana (Uma Thurman) is the beautiful wife of a professor (Sherman Alpert), an art history teacher, and mother of young Emma (Gabrielle Brennan).  There is something not quite real about the atmosphere: Diana lives in fear and grief (?Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome?) and despite her 'perfect' surroundings, she is ridden with anxiety.  When asked by a friend if she is going to attend the 15 year Memorial for the school shooting event Diana says she hasn't decided.  What follows is a series of flashbacks allowing us to fully understand the young Diana's motivations and impulsive behavior and her close relationship with Maureen before the tragedy changed their lives.  But gaping holes in the history of the event and the subsequent years ultimately force the viewer to decide what actually happened in the past: are we witnessing reality or imagined dreams - and it is left to every viewer to decide the facts of the story for themselves.

Uma Thurman is brilliant in this challenging role and Evan Rachel Wood is equally stunning as the younger version of Thurman's role.  The entire cast contributes an ensemble performance that keeps us involved in this thriller from opening frame to closing credits.  Vadim Perelman's approach to the story offers subtle, visually magnificent images that provide clues throughout the film about the division between real and imagined.  This is a fine film on every level.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, August 08",1219536000,13,2532,5.074698795180723
