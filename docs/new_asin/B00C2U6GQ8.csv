5689127,5,B00C2U6GQ8,Very hilarious movie.  Corey Feldman's portrayal of Bill Maher in this movie is SPOT ON.  I will watch this over and over it is so funny.,1422144000,,137,4.230769230769231
5689128,3,B00C2U6GQ8,"I was prepared to dislike this movie from the start. A rom-com set in Afghanistan. The first half of the film was charming-reminded me a little of Mel Brooks-""The Producers"".(Does Springtime for Hitler and Germany"" )ring a bell?

To the midpoint it was pretty good-,and was winning me over. Unfortunately the ""comedian"" becomes a dominant character-and his Bhorat offensiveness is a matter of ones personal taste,or lack thereof.

There's a twist at the end of the movie that tries to tie together the various plot lines. It fails-leaving this movie very close to being a right wing screed about Muslims.

Meh-There's a comedy set in Iraq called ""Saving Private Perez"" which is genuinely amusing,playing on many stereotypes,but the humor is superior. The acting better. The script better,etc etc  see : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461336/

If you are paying to see  Zero Dark Dirty,your bucks are better spent seeing ""Saving Private Perez"". Satire doesn't have to be hateful-unless Howard Stern and Bhorat are your heroes.

Zero Dark Dirty is better than ""zero"" but it fails to be better than low average. It's watchable-but the mid film shift is jarring.",1416873600,,1156,5.216216216216216
5689129,4,B00C2U6GQ8,"Zero Dark Dirty tells a well-rounded story with fun characters (some likeable, some not), entertaining gags, and a decent amount of soul. Many of the jokes are at the expense of extremists (American and otherwise), but the social and political commentary is done with sincerity and kindness, and never at the expense of the story.

I give the film extra credit for being an indie production. I don't know what their actual budget was, but the acting is as good as any mainstream big-name Hollywood comedy, and the writing is much better. Honestly, I often get frustrated at big-name movies for having huge effects budgets but predictable and uninteresting stories. Is it really so hard to write a good story? I imagine that it is, but the fact that the ZDD crew successfully created a good story on a small budget shows that good stories *are* possible. Shame on Hollywood, and good for ZDD.

I came to the movie expecting to find a ham-handed caricature of arrogant American imperialism, something along the lines of Borat or Team America. So, I was expecting to dislike it. I was wrong. Turns out, Zero Dark Dirty is an honestly fun movie.",1412035200,2,1141,4.757575757575758

5689131,4,B00C2U6GQ8,"This movie has a little of everything - comedy, action, politics, a touch of romance and music! I chuckled, I gasped at the non-PC dialogue, and quite enjoyed the music interspersed throughout the movie - did I mention an homage to Les Miz set in a tent in Afghanistan? While this movie is not for everyone, I can definitely see it working it's way to ""cult classic"" status and being the trigger for a lot of conversation. It is surprisingly well-acted with a lot of new faces and several ""names"" for good measure (Corey Feldman like you've never seen him and ""the soup Nazi"" in a role with a lot of heart.) Oh - the best car/camel chase scene ever!  Yes, I said camel.",1405036800,2,669,4.395161290322581
5689139,1,B00C2U6GQ8,"The father character in this story is a huge derriere rift.  The only reason I kept watching it was because I hoped to see him getting what he deserved.  The storyline has been done before, more effectively, too.  It's full of tropes that are presented with a lack of a creative twist.  The acting and dialogue are a little stilted although I believe that's more the director's fault.  The hope of something bad happening to the jackdonkey of a father is the only thing that makes this movie worth watching.",1507334400,,507,4.588888888888889
5689140,2,B00C2U6GQ8,"This was such a mess. No continuity. You don't get any real answers about the house. Creepy little girl who draws violent pictures and smiles in the face of violence. Teenage girl with raccoon eyes who hates her step dad and says he isn't her dad, but still calls him dad? Mom is a fragile lunatic whose main line is ""He's your father!"". The father is an abusive a-hole who swears in front of his kids, screams, and beats his wife. One scene, he physical starts beating her cause he thinks she is crazy when she says she is seeing ghosts. The next scene they are in the bedroom and he asks what's wrong. uh, you just attempted to assault her? She acts like nothing happened and that they all must think she is crazy, and he says no. Then they have...relations. He thinks his wife becomes a ghost and throws her. Wife gets mad and now calls him crazy, even though now he should believe her. Then he suddenly becomes a serial killer.

Terrible acting and terrible delivery of lines.",1504310400,2,980,4.414364640883978

5689142,1,B00C2U6GQ8,The scariest thing is bad makeup and the fact that I sat through the entire film.,1502064000,2,81,4.125
5689143,1,B00C2U6GQ8,Don't waste of time! The acting was so horrible. This movie sucked! Wasted about an hour and half of my life! Geez.,1499040000,,115,4.2727272727272725
5689144,1,B00C2U6GQ8,"Sadly, I can't get the time I wasted watching this back.  Horrible acting. I can't tell you my opinion of the storyline, as I never saw one. Do yourself a favor, hit yourself in the head with a hammer. Better use of you mind and time than this waste of film.",1498608000,,258,4.0588235294117645
5689145,1,B00C2U6GQ8,"I can usually deal with bad acting. I actually like cheap B-horror movies with bad acting. However, this movie takes the cake. The acting is awful! They say their lines in sentences. AND sometimes don't even separate the sentence. I can never tell if they are supposed to be serious or what.",1496793600,,291,4.615384615384615
5689146,1,B00C2U6GQ8,"Every awful thing about this movie has been covered many times over, so Ill spare you the redundancy--I agree with all of it.

I do want to add a few things:

On IMDB, the dog gets first billing. Think about it.

The opening scene takes place in 2004, so why does the woman have an iPhone (the first generation was released in 2007)?

If its AMERICAN Conjuring, why are these people Canadian? Canadians COULD be referred to as American, as in North America, but no one does that.",1495843200,5,479,4.409090909090909
5689147,5,B00C2U6GQ8,"To start off, this five star rating is satirical. Flaw #1  the horrid acting exhibited in the first scene was laughable. Flaw #2  don't make an adult play the role of a teenager; it makes the film so unauthentic even though that tone was already set. Watching the teenager stare off into the distance was simply cringe worthy, it did NOT display the effect of moodiness/attitude. Flaw #3  if you cant afford more film/editing, make sure your actors don't screw up their lines! Flaw #4  If this realtor is trying to get rid of this house, how does having him physically attack the previous tenant persuade the new buyers? So CONFUSING! Flaw #5  EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE. Bad transitions, don't get me started on the acting (again), and overall cheaply made production. Thank you for reading. P.S, the maggot puke was the only good part in this entire film.",1494892800,2,853,4.736486486486487
5689148,1,B00C2U6GQ8,"The acting was terrible, but it was the dialogue and writing that threw me off. No one in this movie had a regular human reaction to anything that happened to them in this story. I can say that the movie was absolutely hilarious in some places (especially the parts featuring ghost chick ""gone wild""), but you'd better keep a Stephen King novel nearby if you have any intention of actually feeling fear. Many of the B-movie people have figured out that yes, you CAN shoot an entire movie with a smart phone, but they sometimes forget the part about telling a good story with believable dialogue.",1494633600,,595,4.622641509433962
5689159,4,B00C2U6GQ8,"really liked this movie, i watch a lot of horror movies and this one is pretty good i think its worth the time to watch.",1491004800,,120,3.84
5689160,4,B00C2U6GQ8,"This is a genuine ""B"" horror movie. What could people have possibly been watching to give it 1 star? Maybe big productions like ""Silent Hill"". Well, that's not fair, this is an indie movie so should be judged against all the ""F"" level drivel that's served up. In context this is pretty darn good. It's basically a take on The Shining (as usual the cover and title has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie), the actors are all adequate, the effects pretty good, though the 'ghoul' is overdone & cartoonish, less is more here. Young girl makes a great 'creepy kid' yet she is sadly underused, the focus is on the dad who isn't up to a lead, this girl was... according to IMDB she has quite a career going, no surprise. The 'creepy kid' angle is always a winner and when you have a girl that can pull it off USE HER! The actor playing the dad couldn't handle a script that was centered around him & I had trouble believing the other girl was 16 (more like 26) other than that good effort & well worth a watch.",1489363200,2,1009,4.287958115183246
5689161,3,B00C2U6GQ8,"Overall, I didn't care for it.  It started out with so much potential and I really thought I was going to like it.  Then it just got weird.  And the worst part was the ending.  The scenes where it was like a vision for the actor were done horribly...you had no idea what was going on.  However, I did want to find out what happened to the family so I watched it till the end.  Just a lot of missed potential.",1487980800,2,408,3.9753086419753085

The entire movie flowed as though it was a copy/paste of the script for The Amityville Horror (2005 with Ryan Reynolds version).

5689262,1,B00C2U6GQ8,I couldn't watch the whole thing it was so awful. Was this is a student film?  Did they just pull random people off the streets and offer them a part in the movie. I mean not one person in this whole thing could act. Nothing in it made any sense. The oldest daughter throws up live worms and the parents act like it's no big deal. The Mother walks in on the youngest daughter sawing at her arm with a knife and she says she accidentally cut herself. It's free to watch with a Prime account and even then it's not worth it.,1472428800,,522,4.067961165048544

I think it was scary, wish it was more then just the man that was having a conk on the head and dreaming. It needed a bit moor. It was good, & had me going. The Mom was not a very good Mom or Wife.

And as boring as and left you wondering if it was ever going to finish.  The jump scenes were not shocking or scary only because it was too obvious.  More like the makers of the film  completed this in 2 days and rushed to release without review.  The scariest thing is the cover.,1472169600,,416,4.243589743589744

Right now, its free for Prime Members so watch for free; it is entertaining and the acting is fine. I guess I would rate it as a strong B type film. It's a lot better than some of the free Prime horror movies that are being offered. Oh,by the way; there wasn't any conjuring involved.

Angry teen girl (um, every scary movie where the family relocates), step dad that turns violent (straight out of  Amityville Horror), pathetic mom who accepts the verbal and physical abuse of her husband and teen (I cant help but thinking of Shelly Duvall in the Shining), little kid who laughs like a creep (hello, every scary movie with a kid).... there is no build up, and it rushes without reason into every next development. You get some Amityville, some Hostel, some Shining, some little bits of a bunch of movies and none of it done well. Its not even good as background noise because you can hear the terrible mother and father saying their lines.",1520467200,,765,4.701492537313433

8576707,4,B00C2U6GQ8,"So this may not be a 4 star movie, but it's also not a 2 star film. Maybe because I've watched my fill of Netflix and Prime B rated horror flicks, I have a soft spot for indie films that try really hard. I'm not sure what the 1 star reviewers are comparing this to, but they obviously haven't watched many of the B rated smartphone filmed movies that are out there. If they had, they would recognize the elements of talent this little gem has to offer!

Yes, the acting is a tad stiff, and the storyline is a bit all over the place, but it keeps your attention, has great mood and scares, and I actually LOVED the ending twists! I thought the ghost woman was a riot...a horny one at that, haha, so not for the straight laced crowd who doesn't think sex or intimacy has ANY place in film, (even though there is sex and intimacy in REAL LIFE, so I'm not sure why films shouldn't depict it... although maybe those who write reviews like ""there was unnecessary language and sexual content"" aren't really enjoying sexual intimacy ANYway, haha).
So aside from some minor setbacks, I think this film really held it's head above water, so I feel it deserves at least a solid 3 rating, maybe even 3.5, so I'm tipping the scales a bit with my vote.",1516406400,,1238,4.313304721030043

There's bad, and then there's the scary and sad realization that a bunch of adults found everything from the acting to the plot even merely passable. It's like they found this one in the bargain bin covered with garbage and thought, yeah, let's see if we can offer it to people who are doing a search for the Conjuring but end up streaming this instead thinking it's just as good. It's like a bout of food poisoning on screen, in one scene, literally. If this sounds good to you, bon appetit. PS, that's not even one of the characters on the poster. Where did they find that image?",1507507200,,681,4.456
