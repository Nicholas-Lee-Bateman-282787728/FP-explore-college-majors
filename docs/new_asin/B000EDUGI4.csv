2517265,1,B000EDUGI4,"This is a real snoozer. I saw this video when it was first released, sitting in a hall with some other people, and I was bored to tears, and a little embarrassed for Burt Wolf.

Conspicuously absent from this video is much about Rawat's former titles and incarnations. Mr. Rawat, previously known at various times as ""The Lord of the Universe,"" ""Guru Maharaj Ji,"" ""Satguru,"" ""The Superior Power in Person,"" ""The Perfect Master"" and ""The Lord All Powerful,"" cops to none of that and the entire interview seems to be based on the assumption that everyone accepts the pretense that Mr. Rawat is an inspirational speaker, or maybe a new-age instructor. That also, is never really explained.

Save your money and watch Burt Wolf's cooking/travel shows on PBS. They actually say something useful.",1138752000,,790,4.932330827067669
2517266,5,B000EDUGI4,"This is a fascinating exchange between Burt Wolf and Prem Rawat (widely known as Maharaji). During the 50 minutes of these exchanges one can clearly observe the growing interest by Mr. Wolf and the focus and attention given to Wolf by Prem Rawat. It is as if Mr. Rawat is unaware of the camera and the whole setting, and only aware of one thing: a human being asking questions about the quest for finding peace within, living a fulfilled life and discovering his potential for joy.

This DVD includes remarkable  footage in which Maharaji at the age of 6 or 7 is speaking to large audiences, while his father and teacher watches over.

The settings for this interview are varied, and obviously filmed over a period of several months. The sound track, the camera angles the whole setting is performed in such a subtle way as to allow the viewer to simple observe, and hopefully enjoy, the extraordinary exchange between these two individuals, speaking about the things that they care about most: their life, and their quest to discover meaning and joy in it.

Highly recommended.

P.D.",1138752000,23,1084,4.775401069518717
2517267,5,B000EDUGI4,"this interview given by Mr . Rawat is amazing.

How many times in our life do we get a chance to listen about the most important thing in our lives.

Our own happiness.

I am so Grateful to Mr. Rawat who is dedicating his life to helping human being achieve happiness.

His teachings have been so profound for me for more than 25 years of my life.",1139270400,7,347,4.134328358208955
2517268,5,B000EDUGI4,This dvd was absolutely lovely.  I found it very uplifting and interesting.  I would recommend it to everyone who is looking for peace in their lives.,1139270400,7,150,4.730769230769231
2517269,5,B000EDUGI4,"This is an inspiring and interesting conversation that actually deals with issues that concern LIFE not things that happen 'out there'. I found myself thinking about it for days afterwards and am intrigued by the possibilities that are raised. Burt Wolfe is a fabulous presenter, he isn't just asking questions, he is engaging Prem Rawat  and the resulting exchange is brilliant.",1139184000,12,379,5.213114754098361
2517270,5,B000EDUGI4,"Have watched this dvd a couple of times - i enjoyed the whole dvd, it touched my feelings and i felt that a lot of what Prem Rawat talked about was relevant to me as well as the world situation. I'm glad there's people out there who are putting such a positive message out because most of what i hear on the news etc is rather depressing. Definitely get this one!",1139184000,10,363,4.126760563380282
2517271,5,B000EDUGI4,"It is indeed a very inspiring talk about life. Prem Rawat's message goes straight to the point: the most basic Human need for peace and inner contentment. And, most important, he presents a way to fulfill this need. I really appreciate his message and trully indicate it for everyone.",1139097600,9,284,4.816326530612245
2517272,5,B000EDUGI4,"I've seen this DVD recently and I feel it's one of the best approaches I've ever seen to the inner peace subject.

It's a fresh and simple perspective that offers a way to discover by yourself the possibility of finding inner peace inside of you.

I'm grateful to have had this chance and I strongly recommend to have a look at it, it's really worthwile.",1139097600,10,354,4.430769230769231
2517273,5,B000EDUGI4,"I really enjoyed watching the Inner Journey DVD. It is refreshing to listen to people talk about something personal and meaningful. Our focus is constantly drawn outwards but perhaps this inner journey might be more interesting.

Both men seemed honest and sincere. I would like to see it again",1139097600,10,294,5.0
2517274,5,B000EDUGI4,"Hi

""Bagus"" is a Malaysian word. It means ""GOOD""

Actually even the word ""Good"" does not properly define what i want to express. I really liked it. I have heard many speak on this subject but Prem Rawats response in this interview is so clear, simple and his words seem to touch my heart. I would recommend this DVD to anybody.",1139011200,11,327,4.344262295081967
2517275,5,B000EDUGI4,"What can anyone hope to find in todays media? - a refreshing and clear view of what any human being can do for themselves.

I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it to anyone with an open mind and enquiring heart.

2517276,1,B000EDUGI4,"As I viewed this, I was aware of how wonderful I felt and how great it is to have someone talk about loving yourself and focusing on the real existance (breath):  the breath that we take in every day and take for granted.  Prem Rawat speaks the truth about the real joy, the joy of living.  We so often associate joy to what we achieve, a love relationship and getting what we want.  The joy of living is rarely spoken about.  He is refreshing, real and allows us to keep it simple and just appreciate life itself.  What a breath of fresh air in a world where so much is expected of us and where there is so much pain and suffering.",1139011200,13,632,4.139344262295082
2517277,5,B000EDUGI4,A bit stilted during the introduction but then very natural and comes over as very honest and down to earth. The interviewer seemed a very honest guy and the message to look within yourself came over loud and clear. very impressed. I will investigate further.,1139011200,12,259,4.777777777777778
2517278,5,B000EDUGI4,"I have watched this video 5 times and I still love it.

I have never heard anyone speak with such clarity as Prem Rawat .Hugely entertaining and touching.",1138924800,10,154,4.5
2517279,4,B000EDUGI4,"Being grown up in a multi-religion environment with thousands-year  of cultural tradition, I have heard too much religious talk, stories about spiritual search and philosophy. But non of which is less interpretive and as neutral as Prem Rawat's reponse to Burt's questions.

Will this DVD help you? I don't know. But if you have few dollars to spare and if you are interested in the topic of ""Inner Journey"", then take a look and have a feeling for yourself.",1138924800,13,458,4.784810126582278
2517280,5,B000EDUGI4,"It was such a relief to watch a DVD that addressed me as an individual. I enjoyed the intelligent questions that Bert asked and the simple but profound response from Prwm Rawat touched me deeply. These were questions that I have been asking myself for many years and what a relief to hear answers that i could understand, that were so simple and clear.",1138924800,12,352,4.515625
2517281,5,B000EDUGI4,I am ful of praise for the video which is not like videos that kids watch. I think teenagers should watch this because it tells you about why you are alive instead of trying to be happy with things of this world you should try Maharajis (Prem Rawts) knowledge. Because it is amazing how he was only 6 and he was made the person to give everyone in the world peace.,1138924800,,364,4.140845070422535
2517282,5,B000EDUGI4,I was deeply touched by the inspiring contents of this interview. Prem Rawat seems to be a man of great wisdom and yet completely down to Earth at the same time. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get in touch with their true inner-self or would like to find peace within,1138924800,14,297,4.321428571428571
2517283,5,B000EDUGI4,"Burt Wolf has long been recognized for his reviews in the arena of world travel.  His interview (I believe about 55 minutes in length)with Prem Rawat, the noted expert on inner peace, gives a whole new meaning to a new world of travel.  This, of course, is the world of peace that lies within us.  Prem Rawat, in his typical clear and humorous manner, describes how peace is already lying within each of us, and that it is possible to experience that personally.  Prem Rawat can help unlock that door to the inner world.  I believe I enjoyed the DVD as much as Burt Wolf seemed to relish his interview.  Thank you.",1138924800,11,614,4.4375
2517284,5,B000EDUGI4,"Inner Journey is a MUST SEE! conversation with Burt Wolf and Prem Rawat. Working in a scientific field, I never imagined Prem Rawat's message as a possibility. Prem Rawats approach is unique and his message is very clear. It definately made me say ""Wow!""",1138924800,11,254,4.795454545454546
2517285,5,B000EDUGI4,"This is a refreshing and informal interview of Prem Rawat by travel journalist Burt Wolfe. The topic of discussion is what moves a person to travel into themselves - into the domain of the self - and what that journey brings. The conversation is candid, humorous, and at times very touching. Prem Rawat takes the topic of inner peace from a very theoretical (airy-fairy) to a very personal and practical level. Very refreshing.",1138838400,14,427,4.863013698630137
2517286,5,B000EDUGI4,What a relief to hear someone talking about how we relate to life and our own personal experience of it. I found Burt's interview with Mr Rawat entertaining and intruiging. It ignited a quest in me to uncover and discover a deeper meaning to my day to day activities. This kind of content is a rarity to find. Something I feel that I as well as the worId could definitely benefit from hearing. I look forward to more inspirational interviews like this one. Thank you Mr Wolf and Mr Rawat for the uplifting subject matter.,1138838400,12,521,4.494736842105263
2517287,4,B000EDUGI4,"I guess I am a fan of Berts , he has always seemed like this kind wanderer of the planet and its people. Here he turns his attention to the inside journey, the inside world and this time I felt even more captivated as he ineterviewed Prem Rawat.  It is rare to hear people talk about life and happiness in such a straightforward way. Prem Rawat seemed really kind and so enthusiastic about every person discovering the happiness inside.  I loved it.",1138752000,22,449,4.463414634146342
2517288,5,B000EDUGI4,I found the interviews lively and thought provoking.  Prem Rawat is an insightful thinker.,1138752000,,90,5.428571428571429
2517289,1,B000EDUGI4,"Interviews are meaningless unless they shed light on a subject. This interview does anything but. Consider the fact Prem Rawat asserts that he has some special gift for teaching people something deep and meaningful about life and that he's had this gift since he was a young boy. You'd expect any reasonable interview to seriously explore the obvious questions: what exactly is that gift? How did he get it? Just how special does that make him? And, my favorite, how do we know this isn't just another spiritual or religious con?

Mr. Wolff never begins to approach these questions. Rather he simply acts as a smiling foil for Rawat to pitch his vague, nebulous product. It's also important to know that Mr. Wolff was paid by the Rawat organization to participate in this soft-hued infomercial. This isn't journalism and it's not a documentary. It's new age sales, that's all.",1138752000,5,876,4.879194630872483
2517290,5,B000EDUGI4,"I found this interview fascinating. There is a wonderful, simple message in Mr. Rawat's words and that is peace is possible. That this gift exists is a joy for a person's heart, for my heart it is. I have shared this interview with many of my friends.",1138752000,18,251,4.361702127659575
2517291,5,B000EDUGI4,"Burt Wolff has hit the jackpot with this interview.  He many times seems to ask just the right question and, in return, seems to get just the right answer.  Those answers are likely to ring true for many viewers of this DVD, but to watch the brightening of the man's face as he sits across from the ever-engaging Prem Rawat, Mr. Wolff himself must certainly have had his own heart deeply moved by the words of his guest.",1138752000,20,420,4.371794871794871
2517292,5,B000EDUGI4,"The discussion of inner peace or contentment or truth is too often a lifeless, formalized presentation. Not so with this Inner Journey. The exchange between Prem Rawat and Burt Wolff is down to earth and downright real. Burt Wolff is an honest and incisive questioner and Prem Rawat is thoroughly engaging. There's no hype around him, yet he's talking about the most extraordinary of possibilities. It's a fascinating hour.",1138752000,22,423,5.144927536231884
2517293,5,B000EDUGI4,"Wonderful DVD. I felt fully engaged. It kept my interest, brought tears to my eyes shortly replaced by laughter, and then probed depths of meaning that I still remember and benefit from. Mariah, Los Angeles",1138752000,,206,4.914285714285715
2517294,5,B000EDUGI4,"It is remarkable to see and hear the most lucid presentation of an inner journey.

To hear that the opportunity for peace and joy is available within inside me was very inspiring.

If there is a journey worthy of travel, this certainly is at the top of my list.",1138752000,18,261,4.3061224489795915
2517295,5,B000EDUGI4,"I remember watching the Bill Moyers conversation with Joseph Cambell on PBS a few years ago. Prem Rawat and Burt Wolf start where Bill Myers stopped: what is ultimate meaning to search for in life, what is happiness and how do we find it? the conversation is a profound exchange that sheds light on the most profound yearnings of the human being. The conversation covers some biographical elements about Prem Rawat's life, how he started bringing his message of peace around the world, and quickly evolves into a spirited, moving and rather fascinating into what it means to be human. A riveting exchange, with every minute worth watching, and a shining example of what good documentary filmmaking can achieve. Highly recommened. I was also glad to see Burt Wolf, famous for producing documentaries on travel for 25 years, embark on a new filmmaking odissey, this time focused on inner travel.",1138752000,19,893,4.96
2517296,5,B000EDUGI4,"Is peace really possible? Is there really true happiness? Is it possible to lead a life fulfilled?

In this exploration of self-discovery in which Burt Wolf (a veteran TV journalist and host), has a very interested conversation with Maharaji about inner peace. Burt Wolf traveled with Prem Rawat for over a year and engaged in conversations about what is going on in the world today, what makes one happy and how one can choose to live.

The title says it all: an inner journey. Make the journey yourself and be left with a sweet taste for more. This DVD is a keeper.

8108727,5,B000EDUGI4,Wonderful insight on how to to live life.,1454457600,,41,4.25
8108728,1,B000EDUGI4,"Rawat the cult leader has entranced many over the years and Burt seems to have fallen prey to Rawats BS! This DVD is a waste of a perfectly good blank DVD. Check facts concerning Prem Rawat and you will be suprised by what you find! Rawat's base of operation is the UK and Australia so notice how many ""followers"" have reviewed this DVD by their locations.
I give this DVD ""No Stars"".",1350518400,,384,4.347222222222222
8108729,1,B000EDUGI4,"I was given this video to watch by a friend who thought that I'd be receptive to it. Evidently, he's been a Premie for some time. I found myself thinking that it has got to be some kind of joke. I couldn't believe that people actually find Prem Rawat inspiring in any way, and yet, there they were, theater-fulls, lapping up every sopping wet platitude and bromide that Rawat spewed forth. I then embarked on a YouTube journey of Prem Rawat in an effort to amuse myself further.",1327017600,2,478,4.443181818181818
8108730,5,B000EDUGI4,"This DVD has the most fascinating message.  Both Burt Wolf and Prem Rawat are genuine and their conversation echos deep within - as if this is my story too. A trully delightful and inspiring.  A must ""check it out"" for anyone with the slightest desire to discover joy within.",1147305600,11,275,4.591836734693878
8108731,5,B000EDUGI4,I found the subject matter discussed fascinating. You don't get these kind of conversations going on anywhere and the answers given with such natural conviction and clarity. I did find the interview format a little contrived but they are that by there very nature. A very intriguing subject.,1141171200,8,291,5.083333333333333
8108732,5,B000EDUGI4,"To find fulfilment within and to cultivate a simple, heartfelt appreciation for life are uniquely special human capabilities. In an existence where so many experiences and skills decline with time, it's enriching to have some resources that are real and reliable. That's why it's been said, ""Knowing your friends is good intelligence; knowing the self is true wisdom."" Understandably, for some such a message seems empty words whilst for others it provides a welcome possibility that reaches beyond words. As with me, I suspect the latter group will find Inner Journey a valuable investment in furthering one's own inner journey - edifying and powerfully inspiring.",1139788800,11,665,5.3428571428571425
8108733,5,B000EDUGI4,"This DVD provides a great insight into Prem Rawat's approach to life.  I loved the reminder to focus on feeling, not just thought.  It is interesting to observe the responses of the interviewer, Burt Wolf  who is a professional journalist. He almost seems to go on his own journey, through the process of interviewing and listening to Prem Rawat.

I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this interview and the clear, refreshing insight that Prem Rawat has to offer.",1139616000,12,460,4.935064935064935
8108734,5,B000EDUGI4,"I cannot recall if I have ever come across such a clear and genuine description of existence - the answers to Burt Wolf questions are so simple, yet very profound. Difficult to stop once you have started - a real delight!",1139443200,16,221,4.414634146341464
8108735,5,B000EDUGI4,"This is a refreshing and intellectually stimulating opening point for many discussions now and in the future.

Burt Wolfe has an down to earth human inquistiveness, however Prem Rawat bowls him over with each answer. Prem Rawat certainly has a true humane insight into this life and offers some real answers. His answers aren't opionated but more heartfelt for those that are truly looking for answers in life.

This was a delightful and stimulating experience to listen to someone who is so simple in their outlook and refreshingly clear.

Well recommended amongst so many who try to lead but fail.",1139356800,10,599,4.97
8108736,5,B000EDUGI4,"A little background first. I have been a student of Mr Rawat for twenty five years During which he has been known by many titles, however during that time his message to me has remained constant. The simple message that there is peace in this world and that it is inside every human being has been sustaining me for many years. I cannot speak for others but for myself Mr Rawat has never promised anything that was not delivered for he has never promised anything more than that there is peace inside and that he can teach a way to access it. I found the The Inner Journey an informative glimpse of Both Mr Wolf and Mr Rawat, Burts relaxed manner and his travels through many cultures allows an understanding of Mr Rawats message. Being a student of one and a fan of the other I felt that my money was well spent and I shall continue to look to Mr Wolf for interesting gustatorial delights from the world at large and to Mr Rawat for insight to the delights of the world within.",1139356800,8,978,4.320652173913044
