I LOVE this video because it is very low impact, mostly stretching, non-threatening in anyway...you can jump out of bed, turn it on and spend 10 minutes stretching and toning. It's a no-brainer. You don't even have to change clothes, put on sneakers...nothing...just push the DVD player button and in 10 minutes you are relaxed, feel like you've worked out and are ready to jump in the shower.  No more excuses that you can't find the time.  Even if you are half crippled...you can do this.  If you are 90 - you can do this.  It has actually spurred me on to jump on the treadmill a couple of times a week.  I am 63 years old, have arthritis and fibromyalgia and I feel better than I have in a long time.  It is worth every penny I spent on it both for physical well-being as well as my emotional well-being.",1298419200,75,972,4.25

Nutshell: Highly recommended for those returning to exercise, wishing to gain mobility, or in need of an energy boost.

I had to scale back on my senior pilates class since the overhead moves left me fatigued and recovery time was having a negative impact on the rest of my life/activities. However I've found Ann Smith's Slow Motion Therapeutic Exercise to be uplifting and invigorating. Ann says you will see changes in three weeks of every day use, and will discover parts of your body that you never knew you could use before. I'm looking forward to gaining more mobility and strength (and grace), but meanwhile I'm absolutely thrilled to be doing an activity that makes me feel so good and energetic!! Read on for the full review

First off, this program is designed to be therapeutic. Ann goes into some detail about building strength through isometric control (so you aren't just waving your arms around, you are 'pushing' or 'pulling' against an invisible force), as well as proper breathing technique.

The entire sequence is quite flowing and dance-like in appearance and is set to a beautiful piece of music by Chopin. It is a little over 10 minutes in length, and the commentary can be toggled on or off. It is shown once from the front (viewing Ann head-on), and again from behind (see Chapter breakdown below).

I would, like a previous reviewer, recommend first watching the entire DVD. Then start by following along with Chapter 4 (Ann from behind), and then proceed to Chapter 2. It is only in Chapter 2 that I can see all of what Ann is doing with her legs, and this is the one that I like the best for regular usage.

Breakdown of Chapters:

1. Exercise for Healing - Brief talk by Dr. Malinda Bell, on the benefits of movement and the unique attributes of dance training and of Ann's system.

2. Exercise for Watching - (10.7 minutes) demonstration and explanation of Ann's system: a slow-motion dance-like series of movements set to music [can be viewed without commentary, and this is the one I prefer to follow along with]

3. Exercise Instruction - 6 minute talk by Ann Smith, focusing on key concepts for getting the most out of this exercise practice.

4. Exercise Participation - (10.3 minutes) view is of Ann from behind while doing the same program as in Chapter 2. Here she instructs you on the isometric engagement of muscles and has some cuing. [can be viewed without commentary]

Cons: since Ann is wearing a flowing calf-length dress, it is not always easy to tell the leg or foot positioning when viewed from behind (especially at those times the camera is not showing her lower legs).

I would also have liked some cuing on breath while actually performing the movement, at least during the learning phase. (it took me awhile to incorporate the ideas from her talk into actual practice; cuing would have been nice)

At the very end of the DVD, after the credits, you'll discover that the DVD is dedicated to her husband, L. Roger Smith 8/27/26-1/27/05. ""A percentage of the proceeds of this DVD will be donated to Pulmonary Fibrosis Research to fund research for a cure.""",1443744000,16,3149,4.745421245421245

2613139,5,B000GI3KQ2,"I have had back problems for years and have not been able to exercise without triggering a flare-up of symptoms.  This gentle movement and focused opening of the rib cage and lengthening of the body that is accomplished is amazing.  I felt GREAT afterward and noticed more mobility in just a few days of doing it morning and night.  Since it is SHORT - 10 minutes - I did it twice each time.  My only complaint is really a compliment, too.  She talks a lot and takes a lot of time explaining how to properly do the movements which is imperative, but once those are learned, you have to skip to the part where you actually do the exercise together.  Without the explanation, however, I don't think the isometic movements would give the same results.  For a person with intense mobility issues, I was able to do it and felt wonderfully energized afterward instead of the typical pain!! In just a few days of doing it, I can already tell a difference in range of motion, too!",1436486400,5,972,4.4576271186440675
2613140,5,B000GI3KQ2,"I am very pleased with this DVD.  The music is classical, Ann Smith is a great instructor and uses slow but purposeful movements to aid the body.",1428624000,6,145,4.37037037037037
2613141,5,B000GI3KQ2,"I saw this on my new fire stick using Prime. I loved it. The very first time I did this my neck was popping as well as my shoulder(which gives me a hard time). I have a frozen shoulder that is starting to thaw so I really only did this with one arm. Halfway through the routine the popping stopped, and she was telling the truth when she said you'll have more energy because I was tired and stiff and really wasn't i the mood to workout this day. I felt great the rest of the day. I ended up taking a walk, did 4 miles on my stationary bike. Loved it. I am 56 years old.",1426291200,5,570,3.8803418803418803

2613144,4,B000GI3KQ2,"This one is great, but I probably didn't need it, but realize that Anne probably isn't making DVD's anymore.  I probably just needed the longer dvd.  I bought my first tape Stretching for Seniors from Time LIfe in 1998.",1416096000,,219,4.589743589743589
2613145,5,B000GI3KQ2,"I am recuperating from post-herpetic neuralgia from shingles, I am a moderate exerciser & I think this is a great DVD for anyone, any age. I suggest after watching the entire DVD first, then start your exercise routine with chapter 4, includes Ann Smith's instructions, then proceed with chapter 1. On my bad days, where even bending my head forward hurts, I repeat these sequences 2-3 times, as theses exercises don't take very long to do. I borrowed the DVD from my local library & liked it so much I purchased it. Her website doesn't work, will eventually give you links to YouTube but it doesn't compare to her DVDs.",1414800000,6,620,4.6454545454545455

2613149,4,B000GI3KQ2,Definitely a great morning stretch for anyone at any age that could stand up.  It does take some effort to follow her moves in the beginning however it can be mastered after several sessions.,1404518400,3,191,4.617647058823529

2613153,5,B000GI3KQ2,I love this exercise!  I've been doing it almost daily for about 6 weeks.  I have fibromyalgia and it is the only exercise I have been able to finish since it is only ten minutes long. I usually feel better after I do it.  I believe people who enjoy moving with music will enjoy it more than people who find it hard to follow dance movement. her instructions are not the easiest to follow.,1400457600,6,389,4.22972972972973

2613158,5,B000GI3KQ2,I bought this because I have osteoporosis and the many aches and pains that go with this. I have difficulty walking enough to count as good exercise and this seems to be the answer. Start slow and do not try to do the whole tape at first. Work into it slowly or it will be discouraging.

8132379,4,B000GI3KQ2,Did this video using Prime video on fire stick.  I really enjoyed it and felt good afterwards.  I will continue to do this and her other videos several times a week.  My only criticism is that I would like to always see her full body including her feet on all of the moves and more guidance on the pattern of breathing. Wasn't sure when to inhale and exhale. Otherwise 5 stars.  Beautiful and inspiring to watch and do.  Some balanced challenged may want to be careful with the forward bends or have a chair nearby to assist with balance.  Would not suggest some of the moves when having vertigo.  Otherwise great.,1490140800,,614,4.4774774774774775
