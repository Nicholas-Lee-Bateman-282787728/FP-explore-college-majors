8675329,4,B00MYMTALC,"There are scams, there are stings, and there are capers, and this movie grafts the last onto the comedy-Western and succeeds delightfully.  Its 1877, and Sam Whiskey (Burt Reynolds) is a gambler, drifter, and jack-of-all-trades who can never resist a bet or a pretty woman, and often gets in trouble for his pains.  Born in a snowstorm while his parents were crossing the plains, he was orphaned in infancy and raised by a saloonkeeper who, apparently ignorant of his real name, called him Whiskey for the barrel that was his first cradle.  Hes also a veteran of the Union Army who shot Ben Pinkerton in the leg once, apparently by accident, since Ben holds no grudge; in fact, hes recommended Sam highly to Laura Breckenridge (Angie Dickinson), the daughter of a well-regarded family who needs a man to do a very unusual job.  It seems that her late husband decided to finance a filibustering expedition by stealing $250,000 in gold bars (a bit over 1300 troy pounds, or 975 standard ones, at 19th-Century prices) from the Denver Mint and replacing them with gilded lead.  The gold was loaded onto the riverboat Bonnie Blue, which sank in 15 feet of water in the middle of the Platte River.  Now the Mint is scheduled to begin coining the supposed gold it holdswhich will mean the discovery of the lead.  Laura wants the base metal replaced with the real gold (which, of course, first has to be pulled up out of the wreck) before the substitution can be found out (though why she fears her husband will be connected with it is never explained).  And shell pay $20,000 to any man who can do it.

Sam recruits Jed Hooker (Ossie Davis), a literal black smith, and an old friend from his Army days, O. W. (Oliver Wendell?) Bandy (Clint Walker), a soft-spoken, well-read, bespectacled, and incredibly strong inventor (hes developed an automatic corn sheller, a household fan, and something that looks suspiciously like a Gatling gun (actually patented in 1862)), and sets off to dredge the gold up from the Plattewhich brings on a confrontation with Fat Henry Hobson (Rick Davis), a smooth-talking river pirate with glasses that look more like Mason jars than anything, and a gang of river trash (led by Del Reeves and Anthony James) from whom Sam barely manages to rescue his partners.  From there its on to Denver, where Sam must impersonate a Federal inspector (Woodrow Parfrey), fool the Mints director (William Schallert), and figure out how to sneak the gold into the vault and the lead out under the noses of a detachment of military guards.  How he does it is worthy of the best caper artists in modern literature.  Despite some risqu moments between Sam and Laura, this is primarily a quite family-friendly movie that might make a good double feature with Whos Minding the Mint?",1441411200,4,2783,4.775

8675331,2,B00MYMTALC,"Despite a promising central premise and a good cast ""Sam Whiskey"" never gets off the ground.  That can be attributed to flabby direction and an inert script.  Burt Reynolds can also take responsibility for the film's ineffectiveness.  In one of his earlier films he displays none of the charisma and sly charm that later made him a matinee idol and number one box office draw in the Seventies.  To call this film a disappointment would be an understatement.",1434672000,4,457,4.82051282051282
