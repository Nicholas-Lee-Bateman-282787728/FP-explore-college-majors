Better Call Saul it its OWN show and showcases the character, Saul Goodman, in a hilarious (relatively slow) drama. If you like the character, Saul, from Breaking Bad, then you will love this show.  All because he wears a different suit during this season, doesn't mean he is not equally funny... if not much, much more funny.  This is a great show!

ps: I am not a ""verified"" customer of this show because I watched it through AMC, not Amazon.  Enjoy!!!",1466985600,3,672,4.55
8739944,2,B017OAV926,"Is this Bob Odenkirk I'm seeing here or doth my eyes deceive me?  At first, because of Odenkirk's intense sort of gaze I thought I'd mistaken him for someone else. But yes, this is the guy from Mr. Show.

In this spin-off show Odenkirk plays Saul, a sort of DWI guy who helps some nasty people with their legal bills and situations.  He is in the world of Walter White, aka Heisenberg.

I think the idea is that we are supposed to sympathize with the character and Odenkirk does a surprisingly excellent job of playing him.  We see all the guys from Breaking Bad, everyone showing up for a payday.  I fail to understand, though, what the point of the show really is?  Yeah, he's corrupt, he deals with drug dealers and criminals all day every day, and within all of it is a ""I wash your hand you wash mine"" type philosophy that Saul comes to view as almost sacrosanct.  I think it's just supposed to be hardcore and is a subtle sell for free market capitalism.  I'd rather watch Mr. Show.",1459814400,,988,4.355191256830601
