6564900,2,B00M8UU0MI,"Not sure about the 4 Star rating I saw for this film! It started with promise, but unsure directing and holes in the writing (how was one of the main characters (not) invited to the event and then never questioned as to his legitimacy as a guest?!) turned it flat pretty quickly. Unfortunately,  not worth my time or money.",1415404800,,323,4.47457627118644
6564901,4,B00M8UU0MI,"I first had the opportunity to see this film in October 2013when it played at the Philadelphia (Pa.) Film Festival. I liked it then and I liked it as much when the DVD was just released by Magnolia Home Video.

The plot revolves around a well-known chef-owned restaurant in Spain that only allows 30 guests at a time. (WE have a wonderful restaurant like that outside Philadelphia - Taluta's Table - where reservations are booked a year in advance.)The chef has decided to give up the place and hosts one LAST dinner - the hottest ticket in town. A variety of people from all over the world (including two competing Japanese businessmen who want to buy the restaurant) arrive for the dinner. But through some ""mistaken identities"" and a bit too much wine, there are some funny (as well as romantic) interactions. Most of the cast were new to me, but Steven Rea, as an Irishman we are curious about till the end and 80-ish year-old actress Fionnula Flanagan are the ones who amused me most.
It's ""different"" from many films in a number of ways.  Though the package says that the film is in ""English"", it really isn't. The story takes place in Catalonia (Spain) at the final dinner for a gourmet restaurant. Much - at least 50% of the film is spoken in Spanish (and the English subtitles are - thankfully - easy to read). But periodically the characters switch to English, even in the middle of a conversation that started in Spanish! The two Japanese men I mentioned earlier speak in Jananese most of the time but then start speaking in English. It's a bit jarring, to say the least.

To add to the oddity of the production, it was, not only partially funded by the Irish government, it was filmed ENTIRELY in Ireland!  (You won't know this unless you sit through the lengthy final credits.)

The film production ""Tasting Menu"", is the perfect appetizer for a dinner at home, as the gorgeous ""food photography""  (think  ""foodie"" movies like ""Big Night"" and ""Chocolat'"") will have your taste buds salivating.  But it's often hard to catch the subtitles because you are eying the food!

And the soundtrack of pop music is catchy (I searched; there is no soundtrack album. Too bad.).

The DVD for this 85-minute film was no bonus features - not even the Trailer.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Note that this is a review of the Bluray - and the food LOOKS great - but, since there are no bonus features, the DVD is pretty much the same.

6564902,4,B00M8UU0MI,"""Tasting Menu"" (2013 release from Spain; 85 min.) brings the story of various people, set against the backdrop of a fabulous tasting menu meal at the last night of business for Chaluka, a trendy restaurant whose owner and chef, a woman named Mar Vidal, has decided to close it and try something different. As the movie opens, we see Mar Vidal being interviewed on TV, with the TV host begging for a seat on that last evening (she refuses). We then get to know a slew of people, all of whom are preparing to show up for the final meal. There is Marc and Raquel, who made their reservation a year ago but since then have separated. They nevertheless decide they don't want to miss this dinner. There are a couple of Japanese guys who fly in from Tokyo, thinking of hiring Mar Vidal for her next project. There is ailing Countess Matilda, who shows up with the ashes of her deceased husband ""because he didn't want to miss this"". There is Walter Reilly who may or may not be a food critic. And so on. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Spanish director Roger Gual (best known for his movie ""Smoking Room"" a decade or so ago). Second, because there are so many main characters, this movie almost feels like an ensemble piece, or perhaps a soap opera. Will Marc and Raquel get back together? What's the story behind the Countess? Will the Japanese convince Mar Vidal to come to Tokyo? etc. etc. Third, this movie is the latest movie geared specifically towards foodies, with plenty others out there--see for exmaple Jon Favreau's excellent ""Chef"", recently released, and ""Comme Un Chef"" (US title: ""The Chef""), from France, also recently released. We see all kinds of interesting dishes (presumably Spanish regional food from the Costa Brava, where the movie is set). Last but not least, there are some interesting acting performances, none more so than Claudia Bassols as the stunningly beautiful Raquel. Bottom line: this movie is a light-hearted rom-com that thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie flew by in no time, but gets away from you like a feather quickly upon leaving the theater. A psychological drama this ain't!

""Tasting Menu"" opened in mid-May without any pre-release buzz or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati (and left one week later). The matinee screening where I saw this at was not well attended, in fact I had a semi-private screening (as in: there was only 1 other person in the theater besides myself). This movie is not bad but neither is it great. If you are in the mood for something that is as yummy but fluffy as a fresh croissant straight from the oven, feel free to check out ""Tasting Menu"", be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1406764800,3,2838,4.674
