3794337,5,B001TWT0D6,If you are a fan of Russell's I would recommend you get this.  An excellent show of his early work in the states.  The man is a genius with language.  His romp all over the stage adds to his delivery. Do expect it to be typical of Russell--rude and crude.,1394496000,,255,4.06

3794340,2,B001TWT0D6,"Saw Russell Brand on a morning TV show - he was a sensation, so watched this DVD. It was nowhere near his TV performance - mostly full of himself, and hard to understand - given his English accent and the lack of subtitles.",1376006400,,223,4.209302325581396

Russell and Matt need to get their heads down and come up with some new material. Just because this is in front of a New York audience doesn't make it worth shelling out for. The extras are funnier than the actual show.

Come on Russell, don't mug off your fans now. You were doing so well.",1324771200,2,463,4.087912087912088
3794346,5,B001TWT0D6,"My husband and I have loved Russell Brand in everything we have seen, he is brilliant.  I bought this DVD since it was a little earlier in his fame, and it did not disappoint.  We could watch him every day!!!Funny, funny, funny all the way.",1315958400,2,240,4.311111111111111
3794347,5,B001TWT0D6,"I recently ""discovered"" Russell Brand a couple of months ago, when I rented ""Russell Brand in NYC"".  I was blown off the couch!  He is smart, funny, razor-sharp, and FAST!  I may be in the minority, but I happen to think he is extremely handsome too, which only added to the pleasure of seeing him in HD!  I usually have a difficult time understanding many British accents.  Not this time.  After a few short minutes, I understood every single hilarious word.  I saw his new movie, ""Arthur"" yesterday.  He is brilliant and his timing is perfection.  This DVD is a keeper.  I will have it in my collection forever, and watch it frequently.  ENJOY THIS AMAZING CRAZY MAN! There's no one quite like him!!!!!!",1303689600,3,705,4.604838709677419
3794348,2,B001TWT0D6,"While I thoroughly enjoy seeing Russell Brand in films (especially when he plays Aldous Snow), I think he should leave the comedy stage to more adept British comedians, such as Eddie Izzard and Rowan Atkinson.  He's not a terrible comedian, but he makes a better actor/singer.  That, and the HAIR!  My God, I couldn't quit looking at his crazy hairdo long enough to listen to what he was talking about.  When doing stand-up, it is necessary to work harder on what you say than how you look.  Izzard pulled it off because he was more animated than his outfit and makeup.  Plus, Izzard was more well spoken.  I'm not trying to put Russell down or say that Eddie Izzard is the best comedian to ever grace the stage; just that Mr. Brand might want to work on his material a bit more and tone down the rock star image when doing a stand-up comedy show.",1292025600,,847,4.425806451612903
3794349,5,B001TWT0D6,"I love comedy movies but I usually find it difficult to fully get into the whole ""stand-up"" part of most comedic actors' lives. This on the other hand blew me away! Some of his jokes had been told at the VMA's but they were very few. Most of his stuff is fresh and so unexpected! He's very impressive! He is excellent at imitating voices, etc. He's excellent at his visual comedy, too! I didn't stop laughing and I still do every time I watch it! And I've seen it countless times! Also, the extra material is really amusing as well. He's shown for example in NYC before the show talking to random people on the street, sometimes fans. He's just a flat out comedic guy. It's a big part of his personality and that shines through to people.",1279324800,6,738,4.355072463768116
3794350,5,B001TWT0D6,"Russell (that's right we are on a first name basis--after you see this video you too will feel that intimate with him) it is so irreverant, but in a way that makes you want to have him at all your parties.  I loved this video because it gave me a lot of greast laughs.  If you offend easy, don't buy it...well don't buy anything with Russell in it.  As a matter of fact, I wouldn't even recommend you touch the DVD beacuse it is just that nauty!",1277942400,,445,4.091954022988506

3794352,5,B001TWT0D6,"Russel Brand, in my mind, is one of the funniest comedians out right now.  HIs stand up is hilarious.  While there is much focus on commenting on stuff he had already done (like the VMA's) this is still a hilarious rant about what he is ultimately looking for in life.  Nothing too epic on the special features side, but this is one funny and smart comedian.",1273449600,,358,4.393939393939394
3794353,5,B001TWT0D6,"In a british/american crossover humor sort of way.

3794354,3,B001TWT0D6,"I really enjoyed Brand in FSM, and loved his autobio, but the material here is weak at best. I laughed only occasionally; the VMA extra on the dvd was the best part of the whole dvd, mainly for how shocked the audience was.

But the stand-up here is really very boring in general, unless you're one of the worshipping fans like those in the audience at this show, who seem there to watch his hairdo and laugh at any and every thing he says, funny or not. And most of it really isn't. Brand focuses on his favorite subject--himself--and it sounds like most of his best material was in the book and these are just leftover jokes.

I'd save my money and just watch his many clips on youtube, most of which are far funnier than the stuff here.

This material is barely three stars. For five stars, watch some of Brand's heroes do truly high-quality bits, like Bill Hicks or Carlin or Pryor. Judging from this show, RB has a long way to go to reach their level of intelligence in material. He's a very smart guy, no doubt, but the jokes here are not. They seem like outtakes from a much funnier show. He's funny to watch move around, but I watch comedy for the material first and foremost; cuteness and hair styles don't make weak jokes funnier.

But give him time: once he stops worshipping the ground he walks on and gets down to commenting intelligently on things other than himself, as on the VMA clip, he might just end up one of the best comedians of our time.

But being cute is not the same as being a great comic.",1265587200,2,1517,4.327464788732394
3794355,3,B001TWT0D6,I think Russell Brand is a very funny guy but was a little dissappointed that this wasn't much funnier than it was.  I do give it 3 stars though....it was just ok.  I would recommend renting this one and not purchasing it.,1264809600,,222,4.261904761904762

3794358,5,B001TWT0D6,"It began in the usual way with Russell walking out to ecstatic applause and wolf whistling. Then the linguistic magic began.

3794363,5,B001TWT0D6,"I was drawn to Russell Brand after hearing an interview with him on NPR.  Bought Bookie Wook and loved it.  Very much enjoyed this romp in NYC.  He is quirky, intelligent, eloquent and simultaneously vulgar.  I love it.  Watch the extra clips where he deals with a drunk girl in the front row; he is brilliant!
An hour of fun I have watched and enjoyed more than once already.",1244678400,,376,4.391304347826087
3794364,3,B001TWT0D6,"Russell Brand is pretty well known for being a sex addict, he talks about this extensively in his stand-up as well as his written material. This comedy special definitely covers a number of sexual topics, but is also generally funny.

He has a delivery style that reminds me a lot of Eddie Izzard and Ricky Gervais (though I think Eddie Izzard is probably #1 in the list) - it often takes the audience a moment to realize what has been said and then get the humour in it. Personally, I like that style of humour because it's smart, and makes you think - it's not slapstick.

There's plenty of ""language"" in this performance, but it's not distracting. I think where the challenge comes in is that Russell isn't as well known here in the US as he is in the UK, and he's still recovering from a lot of negative publicity he's received over the years because of drug addiction. He is also relatively unknown unless you saw the movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or have seen him on some of his MTV appearances.

If you're looking for a good basic laugh of Brit humour, then the price is right for this dvd (which has mysteriously been dropping in price almost every month) - and don't get me wrong, there are plenty of laughs in this performance, but if you're looking for the upper echelon of Brit humour then go for Izzard or Gervais.",1244505600,,1330,4.465020576131687
3794365,4,B001TWT0D6,"2008 had been a great year for Russell Brand.  The British comedian was in the film ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" , host of the 2008 MTV VMA's and appeared in the Disney film ""BEDTIME STORIES"".

But what separates Brand from other comedians is his status, a pop icon who looks as if he is a member of a rock band, his self deprecating humor had caught the attention of people worldwide but sometimes infamous.  The MTV VMA's drew the ire of several viewers (especially when he tried to joke around Madonna and A-Rod but most of all his comedy in regards to the Jonas Brothers virginity and their promise rings) and media, his comments on wanting Obama to become the President alienated right wingers and he received death threats.

In the UK, his popular radio show drew ire when he and his fellow Radio 2J made prank phone calls to actor Andrew Sachs's about his granddaughter which led to his resignation.  Known for his controversial thoughts on the current news in the world, Brand continues to be one of the more popular celebrities in the UK and even been branded a ladies man winning ""Shagger of the Year Award"" for three years straight.

He has made music (cover of the Beatles song ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" and featured twice on the ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" soundtrack) but when it comes to comedy, since 2006, he has amassed many awards in the UK for ""Best Stand Up"" and was ranked by Channel 4 as #69 in the top 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.

But if anything, Americans want to know what is so amazing about Russell Brand and now many people can experience the comedy through Brand's DVD ""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" courtesy of Comedy Central.

The DVD is quite slick in presentation and compared to other Comedy Central DVD's, the stage setup is actually nicely done.

Russell Brand's comedy is fluid as he goes off on himself in regards to comparing his popularity in the UK and America and having to google himself and see what comes up in the search engine.

The 2008 MTV VMA Awards could have been a sore subject for Brand to discuss but Brand definitely wanted to let people know what happened behind-the-scenes during the executive meetings.  But also joking about the criticism he received from the award show.  Commenting on Britney Spears, Jonah Brothers and Jordin Sparks comments.

Brand also reads death threats from right wing supporters who bashed on him for his comments of support for Obama.  He also discusses his sexuality and telling people he's not gay and loves to be with women. And reading tabloid news about him about his inability to sleep when he's stressed and wondering where the tabloids are getting their stories.

Brand then discusses the filming of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and how he goes a bit gay when he is the company of alpha men and having to learn how to surf.  Also, his experience on riding a horse.

Also, Brand talks about having to meet the Queen of England and thinking about grabbing her breasts and then ends the show talking about sex and enjoying it.  Especially his love for threesomes with women but not with a woman and a guy and his hilarious take on it.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" features an elaborate setup and you get a good amount of camera angles of Brand, especially one overlooking the whole theater and overall editing is well done.  Close up and full body shots from various areas near the stage from the front and rear angles and more.  There were a few second clips that the editor chose to use certain noise filters with a blur that felt a bit off but overall, picture quality is clear.  Video is presented in widescreen.

As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital and you can hear Brand clearly through your front channel speakers and hear the audience cheering and laughing quite clearly.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" contains the following special features:

* The Notorious 2008 MTV VMA Monologue - (6:26) The controversial opening monologue from the 2008 MTV VMA's featuring Russell Brand going off on Madonna and the Jonas Brothers virginity and promise rings with the look of a few celebs and audiences who seem to be surprised (or dismayed) by Russell Brand's humor.
* An Englishman in New York - (10:25) Russell Brand spent a week in Manhattan as he came to New York to shoot his stand-up special for comedy central.  Footage shows the shenanigans of Brand walking through Time Square and being greeted by fans and preparing for his appearance for ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" and photography for the DVD.  Plus behind-the-scenes from the special as Brand goes to meet the audience.
* Loose Cannon Drunk Girl - (4:45) This segment focuses on a big fan of Russell Brand who takes the lights off the stage and gives a letter to Russell.  She continually tries to communicate with him and Russell Brand addresses her several times.

JUDGMENT CALL:

This was my first time seeing Russell Brand, the comedian.  The 2008 MTV VMA's was just not the right setting for his comedy and where he shines is when he can be onstage, uncut and uncensored and the ability to go off and have fun.  This DVD and his performance was the perfect setting for his style and found his entire comedy quite enjoyable and fun!

His humor while self deprecating at times is fast, fluid and fierce but fun and hilarious.  His non-stop delivery is flawless and rarely do you see him pause.  He's literally energetic and he goes all out!

Because of his popular status and the accomplishments he has done in his career, Brand's comedy is quite fun because his ability to use those situations that people are familiar with and gives you the ability to see things through his perspective behind-the-scenes and his reactions to people who disliked his comedy or his opinions.  It's all off-the-cuff and scripted or not scripted, you can tell that doing shows like this where he's not having to guard what he says, this is where Russell Brand shines!

Rarely do you see someone those controversial for his opinions worldwide and then his ability to go use it as a comedy routine.  And most of all, he has the look of a pop star, very flamboyant on stage and calling himself an ""S&M Willy Wonka"".  He definitely has an interesting comedic delivery and he's quite unique in presentation.

Overall, ""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" is a slick production.  Comedy Central definitely gave this popular comedian special treatment as he has a beautiful stage setup (most comedians rarely get any set design on stage aside from a stool and bottles of water) and a wide range of camera angles showcasing Brand and the audience.

I definitely enjoyed Russell Brand's comedy performance.  I'm a big fan of British comedy but for those wondering if they will like it because he's a British comedian, his comedy routine is actually quite easy for Americans to understand and follow.  So, no worries there.

So if you are curious about Russell Brand's style of comedy, definitely give ""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" a try!",1243641600,,7030,4.714402618657938
3794366,5,B001TWT0D6,"There are 3 words I can think of to describe Russell's performance:
1. Spontaneous
2. Intelligent
3. Insane

Do yourselves a favor and rent/buy this. It's worth the 8 bucks from Amazon, and it'll have you rolling.

If anyone actually takes advice from ""Barbara Streisand's"" review below, I feel sorry for you for missing out on this great piece of comedy. Just because you don't like someone's accent doesn't drop their comedic-value.

Another up-and-coming, worth-while comedian to check out is Kevin Hart. Check out ""I'm a Grown Little Man."" VERY funny.",1242691200,,555,5.076923076923077
3794367,5,B001TWT0D6,"Russell Brand is simply the sharpest, most brilliant comedian on the scene presently. If you have trouble discerning British accents, you will get used to Brand's quickly, so don't let the negative comments of one reviewer deter you from this comedic masterwork. Understand that Brand plays a ""rock star"" character that is partly (not entirely) autobiographical -- hence the outlandish makeup, attire, and hairdo.

Watch Brand as the imaginary British rock star Aldous Snow in the hit Judd Apatow comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall for a taste of what you can expect to enjoy when you watch his stand-up routine, which is the best I have seen in years. It is both outrageously crude and hilariously brilliant, which is a hard balance to reach! His humor features razor-sharp wordplay and the most fantastic, biting lines -- you will find yourself laughing out loud, spewing forth whatever beverage you happen to be consuming while watching his routine. Brand's routine is nearly flawless, smart, well-timed, and sharp: Brand spills anecdotes about his wild, drugged-out sex-addict (former?) life, shares inside details about the filming of Sarah Marshall that are wonderful, and recounts zingers about his (in)famous stint as the MTV video awards host that will make you wonder if people should have licenses in order to be able to send emails to celebrities.

You won't be disappointed!",1240358400,21,1385,5.20627802690583
3794368,4,B001TWT0D6,"Personally, I feel Russell is at his best when it's unscripted, off-the-cuff banter. He's very quick, and that atmosphere showcases his humor best. That said, I give this stand-up show a B+. Russell's ability to make mundane, everyday things hilarious is a quality that isn't unique or special (it's kind of a pre-requisite for calling yourself a comedian). What makes Russell special is the way he takes a situation or event, and instead of using the first or even second most likely word/phrase to describe it, he goes way down on the list to grab a term that you've probably only heard 3 times in your life, but fits perfectly. Again, simply doing this isn't earth-shattering, but Russell is so smart, and has so many random references in his mind, that you're likely to be caught off-guard by the way he describes things.
He's obviously a smart man (either the drugs didn't addle his brain much, or he started out Mensa-level), and his spontaneous comedy shows it better than his scripted comedy.",1239580800,32,1000,4.819767441860465
