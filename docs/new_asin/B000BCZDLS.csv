8085434,3,B000BCZDLS,"THREE BROADWAY GIRLS is the 1932 film THE GREEKS HAD A WORD FOR THEM (not The Girls Had a NAME for Them) starring Joan Blondell, Ina Claire, and Madge Evans that was later remade as HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE starring Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Lauren Bacall.  A very famous and rather elusive film among movie buffs and truth be told, it does not live up to it's legend.  The script is not nearly as good as it should have been and the girls endless fighting takes precedence over their man-hunting.  Suprisingly few good comic lines and Ina Claire's character is curiously villianous at times. Joan Blondell, however, is very sexy though regrettably third in screen time here, regal Madge Evans seems an odd choice for one of these party girls albeit the most noble one in the bunch.  Stage legend Ina Claire was 40 when she made this movie and lacks the beauty of her co-stars but she is amusing when her character is not vicious. Print quality on this bargain-basement release is only fair.  Worth the buck I paid for it at Dollar Tree but not much more.",1128556800,4,1065,4.554973821989528
