8256862,5,B00150GMI8,"""The Great Commanders 6 Battles that Changed History, Part One:  Alexander the Great"" is an excellent documentary about the Battle of Issus which changed the future of the western world.  It is only 43 minutes long and fascinating throughout. Brian Cox is very good as the narrator and the music score is perfectly suited to the video.  The actual battle site is shown and computer generated diagrams of the battle formations are very helpful.  The video is illustrated throughout with photos from the Alexander sarcophagus, Greek statuary and vases, actual Greek armour and helmets, and statues of Alexander and the famous Pompeii mosaic.  It also contains quotes from Arrian, Plutarch, and Curtius.
  The senior consultant is David Chandler, head of war studies, Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.  Mr. Chandler's insights are very helpful.  He states that Alexander was not thrown by the fact that Darius was behind him across his lines of communication.  He turned his army around and marched back to Issus.  He also says that Alexander ""takes a very considerable risk in this personal leadership, but he realizes that if he is to win all, he must sometimes risk all.  That includes his person.  But since he only does it with very careful preparation, it shows the greatness of his command.""  Another consultant, Peter Connolly, author of ""Greece and Rome at War"", explains that the Macedonians had developed an aggressive fighting formation rather than the defensive one of other armies of that period, and that Alexander is ""the last of the great generals who actually leads a charge.""  Dr. Michael Whitby of the University of St. Andrews explains that, ""Darius deployed his army quite sensibly.  The fact that he didn't win the battle was because he was fighting against a man whose military genius was unsurpassed.""  Later in the video Dr. Whitby states that, ""Alexander set himself incredible goals, challenges, competitions to be heroic, and he surmounted these.  He achieved them.""
  Major General Huw Pike of Great Britian explained that, ""The thing that we as soldiers most admire about Alexander is his courage.  His physical and his moral courage.""  The fact that the consultants in this video are men who really know and understand the fighting man makes this a great documentary.  At the very end Mr. Cox sums up with this:  ""His [Alexander's] achievements have made him a figure of legend. For over 2,000 years he has remained the first and foremost of the great commanders.""  Anyone with an interest in Alexander the Great or ancient warfare will thoroughly enjoy this video!",1352246400,,2595,5.063679245283019
