8575613,5,B00BYHNJRE,"I was a child when this show aired on TV. I was fascinated by it then and now, over forty some odd years later, I'm still fascinated with it. Project UFO was an NBC series that aired in 1978 and lasted only two seasons. It was based loosely on Project Blue Book. The show was created by Dragnet veteran Jack Webb, who looked through Air Force files looking for episode ideas. These days, it's looked upon as an early version of The X-Files but with more conventional explanations of what people saw(even though some episodes were left unexplained). UFOs and alien contact is something I've been fascinated with for years and this show still captivates me as much as it did when I was little. I highly recommend this series for those interested in the subject.",1461456000,5,759,4.588235294117647

8575615,5,B00BYHNJRE,I saw this when I was 10 years old and loved it so much.  I'm re watching it and it is very 70s but I still love it just the same.  One of my favorite things about the show is that all the sightings are almost of the third kind and all the ships look like Star Was Bounty hunter ships.  They are all obviously made from flea market junk and model kits.  Also all the Americans investigated are almost all haughty crazy Southern folk.  It's a classic show and I would totally buy it if I could.,1411516800,5,493,3.989795918367347
