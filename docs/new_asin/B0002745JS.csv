Every episode of the series is a touching and inspiring experience; this one is definitely no exception. Oscar winner Patricia Neal(Hud) guest stars in this 2 parter(shown in it's entirety)and she is wonderful.

A widow(Neal) learns from the Doc that she is very ill and has little time to get her affairs in order. The only thing on her mind is finding a good home for her three children, all of which will pull at your heartstrings. Charles promises he will do his best and try to keep the kids together. But times are hard and it's almost impossible to find a home that will care for all the children. Time is running out...will Charles be able to keep his promise? It will take a miracle, and you know that on this series we expect miracles and love them! You won't be disappointed.

So kick back for the entire  presentation -  with Ma and Pa Ingalls, Laura, Mary, Carrie, and good ole Mr. Edwards and enjoy.....oh and don't forget the Kleenex!.....Laurie",1185062400,,1194,4.513888888888889
