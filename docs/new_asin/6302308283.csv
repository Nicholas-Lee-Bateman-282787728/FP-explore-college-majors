7823997,3,6302308283,"Even though Volume 4 is the weakest of the ""Screwball Classics"" series, it's worth having for the rarely seen ""Blitz Wolf"" (1942). This hilarious WWII satire of ""The Three Little Pigs"" was Tex Avery's first MGM cartoon and should have won the Oscar for Best Animated Short. With the exception of ""What's Buzzin' Buzzard,"" the remaining cartoons in this collection do not represent Avery's best work.",1127001600,,399,5.0606060606060606

7823999,4,6302308283,"People should be aware that the other review of this video refers to Tex Avery's Screwball Classics Vol. 4, not Vol. 3. Mr. Komorowski has this video confused with that one. This video contains some real classics. I used to watch cartoons on television anticipating seeing a new Tex Avery, and they are certainly some of the funniest cartoons ever. I only give this 4 stars because House of Tomorrow and T.V. of Tomorrow are not as good as the others. They are okay cartoons, but Avery has made better stuff than those two that should have been included instead. Also, T.V. of Tomorrow is also on Vol. 4, which is a bit of a nuisance for Avery fans who collect all four of the volumes. Be sure to scroll to the bottom of the page to see the list of all of the cartoons on the tape.",981504000,,781,4.283783783783784
