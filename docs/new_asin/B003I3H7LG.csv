4126052,5,B003I3H7LG,"I absolutely love this. The other reviewers did a great job, but left out one important thing---MoMo is not just a bum who found a home by acting as a womans' pet--the character is actually a famous dancer who loves the woman, and values living with her as much or more than being famous.  He doesn't really tell her who he is, just lets her find out slowly. MatsuJun is wonderful in this---I liked him better here than in Hana Yori Dango. In Hana you see him get wild and crazy because he has a terrible temper. In this, you see him get wild and crazy because he's happy (mostly). He's a one man comedy who also manages to be sexy no matter what he's doing.
BTW---what I've said is not a spoiler, as, WE  know who MoMo is almost right away.
You will also get to see some of Matsujuns' powerful and utterly exquisite ballet! I think he and Jang Geun Suk are two of the most graceful men on the planet.

Sakai Wakana Koiyuchi is very beautiful and perfect for the the female lead.
I've also seen the Korean movie You're My Pet, and I didn't like it because they made the leading lady just too mean, and it really bothered me. If she treated an actual dog the way she treated her pet boy, even just in the movie, there would be a huge backlash against that movie.",1335225600,9,1261,4.224066390041494
4126053,4,B003I3H7LG,"I was a huge fan of the manga this Japanese TV series was drawn from and I looked for it for years.  Very recently I found it on a fansub site and enjoyed it then realized I couldn't risk losing it so I had to buy a copy if I could.  The DVDs I bought were primarily in good condition, there was a one or two second date glitch in episode five, but otherwise this was in solid condition.  The DVD do not offer any thing extra -- no behind the scenes, no interviews, no commentary -- but I'm not a big fan of those any way.

The show itself is generally well paced though the final episode is a bit rushed.  The two main actors, Yoyuki and Matasumoto Jun, are excellent in their embodiment of Sumire and Momo. In several ways the TV series diverges from the manga but in ways which I think fit better for a ten episode show set in 2003.  The show really dies into the conflict of individual versus social expectations based on sex, age, and education that I find revealing even after watching it several times.

The four star rating though is for the English subtitles on the DVD.  I watched the series first fansubbed and to be blunt, the fans did a much better job, subtitling signs, books, and especially the episode titles that are all missed in the official DVD.  However the official DVD also is not cluttered with all the subtitles in other languages I found on the fansites.  An official DVD though should go above and beyond this quality of subtitles.

I highly recommend this series and I'd be thrilled if they made a follow-up series to show us how Momo and Sumire are doing in let's say 2013, a decade later.",1326931200,3,1619,4.31023102310231
4126054,5,B003I3H7LG,"Don't let the 1-star review put you off. That review was based on the fact that the person received a defective DVD. I got mine 3 days before the estimated delivery date, in perfect working order.

This is a very fun and sweet romantic comedy that should appeal to women of all ages. Sumire is a smart, successful but lonely professional woman.  After a particularly hard day (she's had lunch with her ex-fiancee, who left her for another woman, and been hit on by her sleazy boss) she finds a young homeless man unconscious in a box outside her apartment building. She patches him up and lets him sleep on her couch for the night. The next day he begs her to let him stay. She reluctantly agrees, but only if he will stay as a ""pet"" - he will have no rights, he must obey her at all times, and sex is out of the question. In return, she will care for him and feed him. To her surprise, he agrees. She names him ""Momo"" after her childhood dog, and he calls her ""Master"".

Her best friend is skeptical about the relationship--how can she let a total stranger into her home?--but it works for them. ""Momo"" gets free room and board, and Sumire gets the unconditional affection she's been missing. Momo is kind of useless as a human being--he can't even wash dishes without breaking them--but he kind of works as a pet. He's a good listener, he intuitively senses his ""owner's"" moods, and he's always happy to see her when she comes home. Then a Sumire's former colleague moves back to town and asks her out. The new guy is everything she is looking for in a man--tall, good looking and successful--but she just can't seem to be herself around him. She's always cutting their dates short in order to run home and spend more quality time with her ""pet"". Ironically, cardboard box guy understands her better than either her former or current boyfriend. Can he make her see him as a human before it's too late?

P.S. I watched this with my 81-year-old mother, who also really enjoyed it. Mom thought the subtitles went a little fast in places, but I had no problem with them.",1314489600,16,2068,4.4485488126649075
4126055,1,B003I3H7LG,I love this series and was super excited to finally see it on amazon so I could bring it home but to my disappointment between the middle of the first disk it freezes and then the voices are off for the rest of it. I have not been able to finish it because of this and not only that my shipping was terrible. I am not pleased at all :/,1306022400,5,335,3.8
8397271,5,B003I3H7LG,Matsumoto Jun .......... need I say more?  The subtitles are good throw the whole drama. The psychology that is used in this drama is interesting ( if you don't stain your brain thinking about it). I can say that it's fun to watch. And Matsumoto Jun ......... did I mention Matsumoto Jun?,1479168000,,288,4.538461538461538
8397272,3,B003I3H7LG,"I had high hopes of this, since I am a great fan of the manga (unfortunate English title: Tramps Like Us). However, while they cast attractive and suitable leads, I felt that the series just took the main premise of the title and made their own story. The story was pretty much taken over by the maladjusted, misogynistic psychologist and the spy for Momo's mother. We don't get to experience Sumire's martial arts skill, never meet her two very scary and strong sisters or Momo's ""Demon Sister Quartet"", and Hasumi-senpai never realizes what a scumbag he really is. Instead, Sumire is forced to shoulder all the blame for the failure of their relationship, even to the point of having her be unfaithful to him. This series is completely open-ended with no real determination of Sumire and Momo's relationship, unlike the manga which provided a satisfactory conclusion to their story. I have read that a new series is in the works, and I hope that it will be more faithful to the book.",1465257600,,985,4.732558139534884
