8358770,5,B002A00J18,My kids favorite DVD!!!!,1468886400,,24,5.25
8358771,5,B002A00J18,"What a phenomenal disc. Great for pre- and early school age children. Combining shapes, music, and art. It is my granddaughter's favorite disc and I love to sit with her to watch it. There is also a language learning section, though we love the graphics most.",1380672000,,259,4.6521739130434785
8358772,5,B002A00J18,"Great movie for whole family, if you like classic music. Our kids, ages 13, 7, and 4 months watched it with excitement! Thanks!",1362960000,,127,4.565217391304348

He loved the movements and colors.i would deff buy this for someone esle. Plus i love the classical music its relaxing and stimulating for the mind.,1313020800,,312,3.890625
8358774,5,B002A00J18,I got this for my littlest niece and she was mesmerized by it.  Can't help but believe that the combination of interesting music and primary shapes/colors will be good for growing brains too.,1262649600,,191,4.787878787878788
8358775,4,B002A00J18,"It was pretty rare that I would pop in a DVD for my son, but of the three we owned, he by far loved this one, so it became my # 1 choice.  The vibrant colors pop on screen, and there is a good variety of the visual images.  Would definitely indicate that I think this is more geared towards young babies / maybe early toddlers.",1262217600,,327,3.9393939393939394
8358776,4,B002A00J18,"The graphics are excellent and synchronized amazing well with the classical music.  There's not much learning going on though.  The voice speaking the object names is dull and lifeless.  If you want to keep your child entertained and have them learn at the same time I believe there are better options.  There are no opportunities, short of stopping the DVD, to mention the shapes and colors to my toddler as they go by.  And she likes interacting with me and pointing out things to me; otherwise she gets bored.  The graphics and music are why the rating is as high as I gave it.",1255564800,,580,4.528846153846154
