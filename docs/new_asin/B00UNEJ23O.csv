7062584,4,B00UNEJ23O,"""Screaming Eagles"" is a not-too-bad, watchable b&w ""B"" movie from 1956.  It depicts the actions of a planeload of paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division (who's famous nickname ""Screaming Eagles"" comes from the open-beaked, red-tongued white bald eagle on their shoulder patch) of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment just before and during the first few days of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in World War II.

As World War II movies go, this is one of the lesser ones, but the characters are at least uniformed and equipped much more accurately than those in larger-budget epics such as ""The Longest Day.""  The plot is mainly concerned with a disgruntled and belligerent new replacement (Tom Tryon), who, along with his buddy (Martin Milner), joins a platoon of paratroopers in England just before the jump into Normandy during the early hours of D-Day. The paratroopers jump into combat, encounter the Germans, suffer a few casualties and a serious wounding, and find -- of course -- a beautiful French girl who helps them as they work their way to their D-Day objective.

1950's through 1970's TV and film viewers will probably recognize some familiar faces among the members platoon such as Robert Blake, Paul Burke, Alvy Moore, Paul Smith, Joe Di Reda, Jan Merlin, and Jaqueline Beer.  The cast even includes Edward G. Robinson, Jr.!",1432512000,15,1344,5.036036036036036

8707571,4,B00UNEJ23O,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

Great Movie !!",1490054400,2,385,4.686567164179104
