8087142,5,B000BITUUM,"This was pitched just right for my almost 4 year old when his sister was born.  Sure, it's not Pixar quality, but a little kid doesn't need that.  Maybe some other adult reviewers found it ""boring,"" but my kid was riveted because it spoke to just how he felt.  He didn't need special effects for that.
