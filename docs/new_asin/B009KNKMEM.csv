5344614,5,B009KNKMEM,Live at Austin City Limits---Steve Miller Band---What a tremendously awesome concert! FIVE stars plus +++++! Steve Miller rocks! Very satisfying concert.,1356307200,,153,6.333333333333333
5344615,5,B009KNKMEM,This DVD will rock your socks off.  I always thought the broadcast version last year on PBS short changed the fans.  Okay this makes up for it.  Thanks.,1355702400,11,152,4.357142857142857
5344616,4,B009KNKMEM,"I have seen the Steve Miller Band twice in the last five years.  They have never disappointed me.  This concert audio is very good.  The video falls a little short of what I have become accustomed to by watching HD tv.  Even so, I would highly recommend this to any Steve Miller fan.",1354838400,5,283,4.283018867924528
5344617,3,B009KNKMEM,"Hi Folks,

before you say NOT helpful because I'm not rating this 5 stars ... here is my reason. I am a huge Steve Miller fan, and I do love the show. From editing to the filming and performance all would be 5 stars. My problem is that this DVD is one of the worst I've seen since the early days of Platinum Entertainment with their pixelated messes. This isn't close to broadcast quality and goodness even decades old Austin City Limits DVDs look great... this isn't crisp, well saturated or anything close to a broadcast quality and its just too bad because the concert is a lot of fun ...it just looks second rate. Its frustrating and looks like pushed film or poor lighting but its so odd because although its a new venue for Austin City Limits...they are first class...so I assume this comes down to poor DVD authoring and decisions made to cut corners at that end. I did check and it is a very LOW Bitrate...

I'm still glad they made it , I'm glad I have it ...but am confused by the low res production.

UPDATE:  I downloaded an HD version on iTunes that looks terrific, why this DVD is so poor is still a mystery and I wish they'd release on Blu Ray...it's a terrific show.",1353628800,43,1182,4.3108108108108105
5344618,5,B009KNKMEM,"So Glad...I bought this DVD !
I attended the (Austin, Tx) Moody Theather Live version of Steve's 1st visit to perform & tape an Austin City Limits segment. This DVD does not disappoint. This was one of the best shows (band was tight) and sound acoustics I've ever had the pleasure of attending.

Play this at your next party and watch the fun begin. As they do in Austin - Come early, Be Loud, and Stay Late. I have enjoyed reliving this amazing concert...and the best thing about this former Texan, Steve Miller, is he gives back to the community by raising over $500,000 for Kids Rock Free, a ""free"" music school in Corona, Ca.

5344619,5,B009KNKMEM,"I was lucky to attend this concert in person and, after watching the show, I would say that this DVD captures the electricity of that night at ACL Live at the Moody Theater.

It's a near-perfect set list for any Steve Miller Band fan starting with Jet Airliner, ending with Rock'N Me, and filled with the hits throughout.

The performances are excellent as you would expect from such a seasoned touring band.  The Austin City Limits cameras do a great job of bringing you into the action with multiple camera angles and deft editing.

The ""extras"" - including behind-the-scenes footage and a full interview with Steve Miller are cool as well.

Highly recommended!",1353456000,24,663,4.831858407079646
5344630,3,B009KNKMEM,"An ok show, but just ok.  Some of his best recordings were not included such as Dime a dance romance, Gangster of love, Song for our ancestors.  Other than that I guess it was alright.  His interpretations of his own experience come through, showing how he sees the world.  His take on The joker really got my attention.  If you'e a fan give it a try but don't expect to be blown away.",1496188800,,385,4.219178082191781

5344632,4,B009KNKMEM,"As others have pointed-out, the video production is acceptable (a bit grainy at times) - you won't become dizzy due to the camera perspective changing every 3 seconds, as is so often the case. But for me the real disappointment is the soundtrack being Dolby 2.0!? A recent live performance like this should be DTS 5.1, or Dolby 5.1 at the very least. I assumed it would be...

Despite this, I enjoyed the performance and would recommend it. Overall 3.5 stars.",1494028800,3,459,4.666666666666667

5344690,2,B009KNKMEM,"I love the Steve Miller band and oldies rock and roll in general.  I have more than 80 concert DVDs.  Here's the rub - this is a concert that's been recorded w/ 2nd class equipment.  The video is a bit grainy, like a home video shot in the dark.  The sound is ONLY DOLBY 2.0 - there are no options for any other arrangement.

Now I have a fine A/V system w/ a premium Yamaha natural sound receiver and this is one of the few DVDs that has to be played w/ no effects on.  If I let the Pro Logic system attempt to use the decoding they've used, I get mostly center channel and little left and right (of course, no surround) - turned completely off the sound is good, but not great.  What a shame for such a fine concert.

Here's the unfortunate key - the cover reveals that PBS (i.e. GOVERNMENT) is involved in this recording.  Naturally, anything that the gov. gets involved in is 2nd class.  They probably waste half their money and then use that as an excuse for 1960's equipment.  And that's after watching the interview afterwards that says the facilities are brand new.  Well, they forgot to update their cheap equipment.  If there are any better options for a Steve Miller DVD (which I'll check after writing this), then I may attempt to ask for my money back.

THERE IS SIMPLY NO EXCUSE FOR A 2011 CONCERT NOT BEING WELL RECORDED IN DOLBY 5.1 OR DTS 5.1, period!!!!",1373414400,6,1371,4.325490196078431
