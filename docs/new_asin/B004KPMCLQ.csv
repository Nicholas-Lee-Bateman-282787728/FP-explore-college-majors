8433290,5,B004KPMCLQ,"I never understood why so many people just don't ""get"" Wikipedia.  I think it boils down to those who subscribe to the notion that humans are naturally flawed and untrustworthy and require authority figures to ensure peace and order, versus those who think that people are naturally good caring people who have a lot to offer, which is the foundation of ""soft security"".  I have yet to hear an intellectually honest argument against the wiki model.  The opposing experts in this documentary unabashedly employ logical fallacy after logical fallacy in their attempts to convince everyone that Wikipedia is fundamentally flawed while they sink in their ships of conceit.  Story after story about their experiences on the site sound like total B.S. as they don't even seem to know the basic editing rules which, of course, allows them to create and endless stream strawman arguments which have no basis in reality and become very annoying.  The detractors also make heavy use of rhetoric in their arguments which only reveals how they deserve no respect at all as intellectuals.  Intellectuals acting like arrogant children; that's how I see them.",1409270400,,1144,5.090909090909091
8433291,4,B004KPMCLQ,"As a WP editor since 2005 and administrator since 2007, I figured that between my experience and reading Andrew Lih's book ""The Wikipedia Revolution"", that I had a pretty good handle on Wikipedia's beginnings and Jimmy Wales' vision. Nonetheless, I watched this documentary, which provides a clearer picture of the motives that drive Wales' vision, and a well-needed platform for critical discussion of Wikipedia, with plenty of screen time given to advocates and dissenters of the project. It's entertaining and informative, and a good primer for the newbie as to how Wikipedia works. It highlights some of the flaws that if addressed, could improve both the project and public perception of it, particularly academic and scholarly perception of it.

The one area where it falters is in its omission of any discussion, and almost any mention, of the site's Verifiability and Citation policies, which should've been addressed during interviews in which the talking heads talked about the site's reliability and the conflict between emphasis on experts or non-experts. If a given passage in an article is sourced to an article in The New York Times, or a book by Gore Vidal or Noam Chomsky, then that passage should be considered reliable, and articles that are generally well-written and entirely sourced (which, when vetted for quality are called Featured Articles) should be as well. One talking head in the film does allude to the problem of how the community harbors an inconsistent commitment to adherence to the site's fundamental policies, which I've long argued on the site needs to change.

Overall, though I enjoyed the film, and you're pro or anti-Wikipedia, it's both entertaining and enlightening, given how ubiquitous the site has become as a source for information.",1347148800,3,1780,5.198606271777003
