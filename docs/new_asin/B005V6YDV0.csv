It may not be a big deal to some, but when it effects the finally fight then you got a problem. Unfortunately the big bad at the end is a half nude demon that has a large solid black bar that covers her chest throughout the entire final battle. Its really hard to ignore and took away the epicness of the final battle. I was really disappointed about that and wanted to let others know before they buy this without knowing like I did. Other then that still pretty decent film. I wasn't very impressed with they way they used the music in the film. They series music was more well collaborated. I think if they put more time fitting the music for the fight scenes they would had a better feel to them. Music has a big part of film, and if not used correctly can make the film feel very empty and dull. The film was still enjoyable but the series somehow had a better feel to it.

Long live Garo!",1322697600,,1068,4.159420289855072
