8014774,5,B0001MMFNM,"The main reason I purchased this movie was because Laura Gemser is the star, and as always she is amazing. In Black Cobra Woman Laura is very young, thin in a beautiful way, a lot lighter skinned than she is in Love Camp (terrible title, but great scenes of Laura, even though her voice sounds dubbed), and I believe in Black Cobra Woman we hear Laura's real voice with a slight accent; very cute.

  All of Laura's movies have interesting stories, and Black Cobra Woman has a series of exceptional plots dealing with conflicts that illustrate the differences between Europe and Asia; men and women; religion and science.

  There are three main characters in Black Cobra Woman: Judas (Jack Palance/god figure), the oldest son who is an ophiologist and a fortunate man since he has inherited the family business, which allows him to live a life of leisure sequestered in his high rise apartment with an assortment of deadly snakes; Jules the troublesome brother (Loki god of mischief) who runs the company with the understanding that if he behaves himself for five years he will inherit a fifty percent share of the business; and Eva (Laura Gemser/Eve/snake goddess) who is an entertainer who uses snakes in her cabaret routine.

  One night Jules convinces his brother Judas to go out and experience Eva's snake dance. When Judas sees Eva handling the snakes like a goddess from an ancient cult, he immediately loses his scientific, detached reserve and asks her out: taking her first to dinner, and then to his apartment where Judas introduces Eva to his poisonous snakes.  By this time in the movie we have already experienced a little of Eva's personality: she is strong willed; used to getting her way; opportunistic; erotically attracted to women; and self-centered. Judas conveys to Eva as he handles his prize mamba that he is worried that his snakes might frighten Eva. Eva explains she likes his snakes, but she is afraid of him... With this revelation Eva dramatically flees from Judas' apartment and we suddenly shift to a scene where Eva relates to her boyfriend in a very cruel way that she is moving in with Judas...

 Judas takes really good care of Eva, giving her the use of a convertible Mercedes and allowing Eva her peccadilloes. During this time Eva finds herself attracted to a young, blonde woman who is having financial difficulties and in much the same way that Judas is looking after her, Eva mothers the young woman. As Eva seduces the blonde who while shorter than Eva, is almost a pale body-double of Laura... we learn that Eva's mother abandoned her when she was ten years old, leaving Eva on an island in the care of a woman who knew the ancient secrets of snakes and passed them onto Eva. It is during their courtship that one of the most interesting scenes in the movie takes place: Eva takes her girlfriend to an all girls club to watch the Kim sisters perform...

 In ancient Greek drama, hubris was usually the source of a person's downfall and Black Cobra Woman neatly inserts this concept into the main plot. Judas and Jules both announce they are going out of town. Laura takes this opportunity to invite her girlfriend over for the night, and of course a tragedy that has been foreshadowed several times takes place. Broken hearted, Eva explains to Judas that Jules and her are going back to the island where her mother abandoned her as a child; Eva needs to heal.

 Once on the island, Eva takes her revenge... While the act that takes place is more bogey-man type fiction than anything near reality, it is the kind of myth that is often accepted in what we might refer to as primitive cultures.

 Laura as Eva does an excellent job of acting as she returns to Judas' apartment in an attempt to recapture her brief time in Eden. Her body posture, her facial features all portray a woman who has lost so much, one who knows she can never go back to the person she was, and yet is determined to try no matter how much it costs her. While Eva might have softened the scientific heart of Judas, he too has come to a point of no return, and in the denouement there is a fall from grace of a pagan goddess who loses her absolute confidence in herself, and a cold hearted scientist who implodes back into his self-inflicted exile from humanity.

 Some of the great things in this movie besides Laura and her girlfriends are the landscapes of Hong Kong. It is so much fun to see the city back then. And of course the snakes, while their portrayal might upset an expert, the vipers are amazing, especially the mamba, who is as much of a star of the movie as Laura Gemser.",1352592000,7,4604,4.611995104039168
8014775,3,B0001MMFNM,"OK - there is serious confusion on Amazon regarding the cover art for certain films regarding the titles Black Cobra / Black Cobra Woman.  Let's make this clear:

Black Cobra / Black Cobra Woman / Eva Nera (1976) - starring Jack Palance has a sexy female vixen on the poster with a cobra.  This is a lesbian erotic thriller directed by Joe D'Amato which dates from 1976.

Black Cobra / Cobra Nero (1987) stars Fred Williamson and is the first of a trilogy of Blaxpoitation films from the 1980s that, unfortunately, have often been posted on Amazon using the 1976 Black Cobra D'Amato cover art.

For a great article on the distinction of the two films - here's a website that discusses the differences:

Worse than you can imagine - and as for fans of Laura Gemser - DON`T DO IT. You have been duly warned...",1248825600,7,416,3.793103448275862
8014777,5,B0001MMFNM,"Yeah, I don't know if the people here can't read, or what the problem is. But all of these reviews are for the wrong movie. This is Black Cobra WOMAN. NOT Black Cobra. Two TOTALLY different movies.

Black Cobra Woman is a revenge flick starring the amazing Laura Gemser.
Black Cobra is a Cobra knock off starring Fred Williamson.

So none of these reviews have any merrit.",1195516800,20,372,4.537313432835821
