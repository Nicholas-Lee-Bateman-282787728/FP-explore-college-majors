8253892,5,B00141286I,"The dvd is nice, but the template that comes with it is AMAZING. The dvd shows you how to present the information you plug into the template which creates a great tool to take with you for your listing presentation. You tailor the information for the house you are trying to list. Using this system virtually guarantees you will get the listing. It helps you eliminate objections up front and even sets up price reductions in the future if necessary. I would say this small investment could easily double or even triple the number of listings you get this year if you use it.",1210723200,,575,4.538461538461538
