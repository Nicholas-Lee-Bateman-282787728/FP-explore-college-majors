4465372,5,B004TA1GDM,"My 3 year old just loves Timmy Time.  I believe it supports imaginary play being there are no words, just sounds the animals make.  He seems to get the story lines, he laughs at the funny parts, understand the look of a sad/happy/mad face, and dances to the music.  A great tool for learning about emotions, understanding facial expressions, sharing with others, etc.",1350000000,2,367,4.7936507936507935
4465373,5,B004TA1GDM,Timmy is great and we miss him on Disney Channel.  3yo loves to recreate this stories and pretend he's Timmy.,1337558400,,109,4.45
4465374,5,B004TA1GDM,"My 14 month old Grandson loves ""Timmy Time"", but The Disney Channel has evidently cancelled it.  My Grandson will stop what ever he is doing when the ""Timmy"" song comes on and watch the show.  He loves it.  The ""Timmy Time"" shows teach lessons without using any words only animal sounds.  They are just right for small children.  No violence, etc.  I am so glad that I was able to purchase this video through amazon.com.",1327190400,,420,4.533333333333333
4465375,5,B004TA1GDM,This DVD was exactly what I had been looking for since my grandson requested to watch Timmy Time and it wasn't immediately available on the cable TV channels when he wanted to watch it. It was new and in its original packing and was exactly as described for purchase. A wonderful addition to our family DVD collection.,1317513600,,318,4.5964912280701755
4465376,5,B004TA1GDM,"The entire video is non-verbal except for some baaa's and other barnyard animal noises, which is a pleasant change from all the other kid videos that yammer on constantly.

Timmy is adorable.  His friends are fun and playful, his teachers are very kind and patient and the lessons taught in each show are relative and appropriate to the life of a preschooler.  What really struck a chord with me was the opening segment when the theme song (addictive!) is playing, Timmy hands his mom his pacifier before running off to join his friends as they head to school.

My two-year-old son adores this DVD and laughs himself silly at certain parts.  His favorite segment is one where Timmy accidentally knocks over his friends building blocks.  When his friend looks upset, Timmy knocks over his own blocks too and the two just crack up - high comedy for my toddler!",1314057600,2,858,4.724832214765101
4465377,5,B004TA1GDM,My granddaughter loves Timmy.  We took her on a trip and played Timmy DVDs for her and she was quiet the whole time Timmy played.  Traveling with toddlers doesn't get any better when you have Timmy on the DVD.,1313539200,,209,4.333333333333333

""Timmy Time: Timmy Steals The Show""
(Hit Entertainment, 2011)
----------------------------------------------
A spinoff from the (excellent!) Shaun The Sheep series, ""Timmy Time"" focusses on the toddler lamb named Timmy, whose role in the Shaun cartoons is usually to cry about something -- a broken toy, a lost pacifier -- until somebody fixes the problem for him.  Here, Timmy confronts the social complexities of nursery school, with a super-cutesy cast of barnyard babies, including his best friend, an enthusiastic, super-talkative duckling who likes to wear aviator goggles. Their preschool has two teachers, a demure, jovial owl and a gangly, sympathetic, um, crane?  The kids get into typical preschool conflicts -- fighting over toys, fingerpainting, circle time, and Timmy behaves imperfectly, learning lessons in life as he puzzles his way through each day.

I thought Shaun The Sheep was already pretty well suited for preschoolers, but Timmy does take things down a notch or two: the artwork and animation are much simpler, as are the plotting and pace.  Gone are the tiny, fine-grain details in the backdrops, and the characters are much more plainly rendered. However, the comic timing is is familiar, and nursery-school age toddlers will find the scenarios -- in a school or daycare setting much like their own -- to be captivating.  No violence to speak of, though some nice role modeling for problem solving and conflict resolution.  Great for the tiny tots, although it may be hard for older viewers to work their way backwards from Shaun to Timmy Time. (ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1311120000,2,1659,5.4609375
4465379,5,B004TA1GDM,"Our Toddler has developmental delays and one of the issue is he can not speak.  This DVD works wonders for him because all the animals make their own sounds for communication instead of talking (Timmy says baaa, Cat says ME-EW, Owl says HOOT HOOT).  Our son has began to imitate the sounds and songs (YAY!) and just loves this show. Timmy is so very cute...this show is a step up from Shawn the Sheep and is targeted toward toddlers, but we love it too!  We own both Timmy Time DVD's and plan to order the next one when it is released in Sept.",1310515200,,543,4.252427184466019

8440571,5,B004TA1GDM,"Timmy Time is great for younger ones, and it's interesting to see how they convey a range of emotions without ever using words. The classroom is young animals, probably pre-K or kindergarten. I can watch these multiple times with the kids, unlike some of the other kid videos.",1403308800,,276,4.770833333333333
