8568719,3,B00BHSCL56,"The biggest problem with this video is that it is divided up into six sections and does not flow from one to the next, so you have to use the remote a lot.  Not great as dance, although some of the moves are fine, they do not really go together in real dance routines (the way the Bollywood/Bhangra routines in Zumba classes do).  The ending credit sequence gets at the fun that should be present in the video itself.  Multiple kicks on one leg, some planks and floor work and difficult yoga-ish moves also make this difficult for someone not young or already at a high fitness level.",1486857600,,584,4.388888888888889
8568720,5,B00BHSCL56,"I love this video, along with the other Doonya cardio video. This one has 10 minute abs, a 12 minute lower body section, and a 16 minute express cardio. The routines are fun and I keep coming back to the Doonya workouts even though I have tons of other videos.",1465084800,,260,4.22
