4990535,5,B00481YBWU,A terrific Camp Vamp Romp with non stop action. Bob and his crew of slayers take on pretty much every vampire trope and do them justice. If you're looking for a popcorn chomping slaying good time - cue this one up.,1464998400,4,214,4.2439024390243905
4990536,5,B00481YBWU,"What a fun movie!  Perfect in its blend of action and camp.  It reminds me of those old 80s film that never took themselves too seriously.  Then stunts are incredible, the action is thrilling, and the laughs are plentiful.  Enjoyed the hell out of it!",1464912000,2,251,4.511111111111111
4990537,5,B00481YBWU,"The Hunted is an impossible concept: a vampire action comedy with next to no budget! Amazingly, they pull it off. The film has a laugh at itself, and is lots of fun. The fight scenes and swordplay are fantastic.",1464912000,3,211,4.435897435897436
4990538,5,B00481YBWU,"A clever, witty, action packed Vamp Movie! Unpredictable, but campy, balanced out with lots of badassness. If you like shows like Ash vs Evil Dead, Buffy, True Blood, Into the Badlands, Firefly, things of that nature, then you must watch The Hunted! It's a great time!",1464912000,,268,4.8478260869565215
4990539,5,B00481YBWU,"When your sword swinging hero ducks his destiny as the Chosen One (to lead a ragtag team in battle against an army of vampires) by variously appearing in full Superchicken, I'm-Not-Here-Bunny and his own glorious birthday suit (prelude to a drug addled belly flop off a three story roof (""I'll try that again.  Hang on!""), you're into some seriously quirky territory.
Made for a song (and what a sweet, giddy song it is!) and a backlog of more than a decade of well earned favors, Bob and Jess Chapin threw everything AND the kitchen sink (Quik-E Mac & Cheese included) into this thing.  It's a wild melange of jokes, unexpectedly excellent special effects, and top-flight sword play (Bob has steadily honed his skills on other flicks, from ""Hook"" to ""Army of Darkness"").
Gather your crew, cheer on the Chosen One, and have a helluva fun night!  (Just don't get bit.)",1464912000,,867,4.766666666666667

4990543,1,B00481YBWU,"Awful! Truly awful film! My advice:  do not subject yourself to suffer so by watching it!  It took the first 3 minutes watching this...film... to know it was bad, but I watched it in my best objectivity so as to at least be fair. I gave it one star, which is, to say the least, generous!  The...film... is poorly acted with, at best, mediocre production value all around.  I will credit the cinematographer, however, for his/her better-than-average camera work and the special effects crew for doing better-than-average effects for such a low-budget, but, all in all, literally painful to watch for any reasonably intelligent and tasteful person. I give it one star because the only way I would recommend this film is to effectively punish someone!",1478217600,,748,4.912698412698413

The Chosen One, Bob, an actor who played a vamp killer in a movie is a guy who knows absolutely nada about vampires. He is recruited by by a group of slayers to lead them to ultimate victory.

Here's a movie you can get behind.  It's fun, it's funny and it's looking like it's a keeper.

I have nothing to do with it, besides having watched it, and I enjoyed myself.
Once you get past the low, very low, budget I think you will enjoy this movie too. It is original and funny. I liked it more than some of the big budget movies I have watched lately.

It's the scene where chicken man and the purple costume guy are arguing and walking down the sidewalk and suddenly they sound like they are in a tunnel instead of just on a sunny sidewalk. That's when I gave up. Everything about this was bad. I don't like low budget, I think it really means low talent and is a waste of time.",1466380800,,357,4.188405797101449

There aren't very many surprises and it is a little cheesy in a spot or two, but the directing and acting are quite good.  This was an unexpected fun movie.",1466294400,2,329,4.015384615384615

4990556,4,B00481YBWU,"It doesn't take long to figure out this is a comedy vampire film with weak good vampires fighting strong bad vampires, or something like that. The good vampires are looking for ""the chosen one"" to lead them into battle as they find Bob (Robert Chapin) an under employed actor best known for Vamp Slayer 2. They assemble a group of misfits as this is also a love story and I suppose a very well done found footage tape, filmed by Mike who is now a mute.

Yes, we have seen comedy vampire v. vampire films before, with ""Vampire Academy""  and ""Twilight"" series coming to mind with the latter being funny in an MST fashion. For the most part, the humor was predictable, but good. I loved the pep talk scene, kudos Bob, for being able to combine all the great memorable cliche lines from all the other pep talk scenes of our finest and not so finest films. I thoroughly enjoyed that, and unless you are at least half-way into American pop culture films, you won't enjoy the plagiarisms.

I liked the the film which I would classify as a second tier cult classic...and that is not bad.

SFX surprisingly good (they must have known someone), and even the minor characters have a lasting impression ... a type of film one should watch more than once to catch everything offered ... downside: the acting slightly unequal prevents a max score of 5 but one definitely feels they got more than what they paid for ~ :)",1464998400,,564,4.947368421052632
4990561,4,B00481YBWU,"Greetings Dan's Movie Report valued readers, time to veer away from the serious and the mundane to the tongue and cheek vampire film 'The Hunted', Director Robert Chapin, who also stars in the film as ""Bob"" spins a tale of righteous vampire slayers all in a mission to film a movie, all the while searching for ""The Chosen One"".

Watch for Monique Ganderton as Susan. She is of course a good girl, we learn later (minor spoiler) she is a slayer. Monique makes the transition from stunts to lead actress material with ease. In a comedy such as 'The Hunted' it is important to have comedic timing and she does.

Eventually our story leads to training a ragtag band of misfits and untrained fighters to battle Dragos (Gary Kasper). Watch for copious lines from various movies and poems ranging from 'Scarface', 'Independence Day' to 'Shakespeare'. The put downs and silliness ensues, along with a vast library of action and even a amazing high fall, in a sparse, yet special outfit! HA!

Oh I loved the politically incorrect insults and dialogue. Example when trying to escape from an explosion a particularly brave character who does not want to go down the garbage chute Star Wars style says ""Screw it, I would rather take my chances with the bimbo."" On the other side of the door, Lauren Kim, who is a very cute, petite and crazy vampire yells ""I heard that"" and bursts through the door, with evil red eyes, dressed in black. Sexy Vampire slayer Michelle C. Lee is given the classic line ""So you have returned for more sex.?"" Bob responds ""No just looking for my wallet""  Finally last line I have to mention is the creature they are hunting is and I quote: ""1/2 human 1/2 vampire and the other 1/2 an armadillo"". Ok that is the type of dialogue you can expect, and if you like your sarcasm like I do, it is hysterical.

With many of the actors in 'The Hunted' mainly stunt people, the action is fast and furious, at times over the top, but always brought back home with clever dialogue. Tara Macken, with her character Wendy dressed like an alternating striped mix of Harley Quinn and a crazy school girl from 'Battle Royale' has loads of action. Her preferred method of attack is to jump into the victims arms and writhe around sexually. Not sure how this is dangerous, but I guess you could throw out your back if not expecting it, but Tara is pretty light. In fact it must have been hard for her to pretend not to kick ass, like biting your tongue when someone is insulting you.

There is of course oddities like a 12 step program meeting for vampires and a guy who is almost as crazy as me! This distinguished gentleman has a straining bowl stuck to his head, complete with a pizza cutter, and wire wisk glued on, I see so much of myself in that character, I envy the guy. Actually he is used by the team for information gathering and his on the street knowledge. Perhaps strained through his head with the holes in the bowl, and the pizza cutter extracts the useless material?

 I noticed they filmed a bit on the street by the Chinese Theater where people dress up, and charge for pictures, and the characters poke fun at that. Obviously this was a fun project, and a culmination of years of Chapin's The Hunted series on Youtube. The accoutrements of 'The Hunted' lighting, sound, were high quality, and with Chapin working on VFX for big films, the special effects were pretty cool for a total indie.

As a side comment, and with all of my action oriented reviews I throw my hat in the ring and #Standupforstunts and firmly believe that this needs to be included in The Academy Awards. Support stunt people worldwide, they take the hits, hard falls, with a minuscule amount of screen time and recognition. Quite frankly, they have some of the most interesting stories to tell. Lauren Mary Kim is a top notch action lady now, as she doubles Elodie Yung as Elektra, check her out here as the Sexy Shadow Vamp!

Well there you have it! Is ""The Hunted' high art, why yes, a bong is used apparently filled with spice! Is 'The Hunted' full of cliche phrases?  There can be only one! Who is the 'Chosen One'? Director Robert Chapin mentioned to me about a drinking game where every time the words ""The chosen one"" are said you have to do a shot. Trust me if one does this, the only bottle you will see is an IV in 'General Hospital'. Overall I rate this slick, sexy, slice of RED camera mayhem, a 7.5 out of 10. For the lovely  ladies; Monique, Michelle, Tara and soon to be Lauren who I have already interviewed, well played, keep up the humor. For Tara, your outfit alone had me in stitches, keep on jumping on people, someone will eventually fall over hahah!

Sadly, it flew by too fast and was over in what felt like no time. I already miss it... I loved the hero.  He is such an everyman/reluctant hero.

I also loved the guy from Detroit coming back at the end... oh no, have I given too much away... there are some surprises, so watch out, but mostly its the fun execution that makes the movie.
