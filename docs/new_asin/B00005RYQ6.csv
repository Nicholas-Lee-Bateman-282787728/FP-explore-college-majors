1657953,5,B00005RYQ6,"Although ""Asoka"" is only loosely based on historic facts, it is still a beautiful film. The movie is meant to be a ""love story"" and not a documentary.  The scenery and costumes are spectacular.  The music is superb!  The only real drawback to this film is the way the conflict is resolved at the end.  It leaves something to be desired.  All in all, it is definitely worth watching!",1017792000,,382,4.478260869565218
1657954,3,B00005RYQ6,"One of the most disappointing movies to come out last year... the director (Santosh) nor the star (Shahrukh Khan) knew what they were getting into before it was too late... I mean did Asoka actually become a tyrant because he lost the love of a girl... Back in India he is known as Asoka the Great... he is the most majestic of all the emperors spoken of... but this movie makes him out to be a disgrunted loverboy...The production value of this movie is good.. the cinematography is fair enough.. the hard work of the techs is relevant but the 2 most important factors (Director & Actor, who also happens to be the producer) became too commercialised...so, instead of an historical epic... we get to see medieval masala flick... sheer disappointment... Mr. Khan & Mr. Sivan set out to do a piece on history but somewhere they lost the initiative and made it a boring commercial flick... and Mr. Khan should have never played the title role... it just dosent suit him, personally I believe he killed the character.... rent this DVD ... got money to burn, then buy it!",1011312000,2,1067,4.621052631578947
1657955,5,B00005RYQ6,"Agreed that the movie which is supposed to be based on the life of one of the greatest emperors of India has too much of bollywood in it.
But atleast someone has attempted to show something of India's past.
This movie is not like the old-time movies on Indian kings showing all glitter and glory, shiny thrones, tiaras, etc. or tv-serial-grade nuclear-headed halo-ed arrows.
Instead, the movie makers seem to have actually studied Indian past right from the Saaraswat/Indus civilisation, case in point the head-gear of the princes, the Indian form of martial arts (antecedent of kalaaripayat in the South), etc.
Modern day Indians find the show of flesh in the songs as vulgar, but they forget that that was the time when sex and violence was maximum in Indian history. Which is why buddhism actually took off.
The essence of the movie is of the long path that Ashoka had to take like a roller-coaster ride, from carefree youthfulness and mother's love to turning to the dark side because of losing everything he tries to love, to the final release back unto the lighter side.
Such pathways are often shown in many other stories (the best example being of Anakin skywalker losing his mother and all that he loves leading him to evil ways and then back unto good in Star-wars).
This movie is not going to attract the Indian masses, but will throughly interest a small niche of them who do not mind accepting India's glorious past the way it really was.",1008979200,,1451,4.716535433070866
1657956,5,B00005RYQ6,"It was the first time that I was watching a foreign movie from India, and my reaction was definitely a positive one. This is a great movie about the life of Asoka. I recommend this movie for the entire family because it shows the story from different points of view, and also the songs, the coreography and the argument of the story were very descriptive.",1006560000,,355,4.476923076923077
1657957,5,B00005RYQ6,"A must watch for anyone who enjoys cinema in its richest sense!
 Satosh Sivan(director): ""I want audience to forget in the first 10 minutes that they are watching a period film. So we took elements from history and legends and wove a dramatic story that is PART fact, PART fiction. And rather than sticking to recital of dates and events , I have taken parallels from different lives and put flesh on the skeleton provided by the history of ASOKA.
All we know about Asoka is from the edicts that depict his administrative policies as Dhammasoka. So there is VERY LITTLE HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE of the life of Asoka as a ruler and a warrior or even his personal life. So we had to develop the character from legends.
Actually, my story ends where historical evidence of Asoka starts to appear. My story ends on the Kalinga battlefield where Chandasoka transforms into Dhammasoka""
A blend of old-world atavism and crystal clear imagery, compounded with lush art direction and stirring music, Asoka is a haunting journey into the life of India's greatest emperor. The film is extremely stylish in its mix of Indian aesthetic and contemporary simplicity which reflects in the art direction by Sabu Cyril and pleasing costume design. The performances throughout the film are spot on with Shah Rukh Khan ruling the roost once again with his stupendous and sincere portrayal of Asoka, his myriad emotions and thoughts shining like a mirror in every frame. Kareena Kapoor as Kaurwaki makes a beautiful and sensuous princess, commanding the screen with a presence, that few of her contemporaries can rival. The highlight of the movie is of course the surreal envisioning of the Great War of Kalinga, which is breathtakingly choreographed with a scale that could stand in good stead with some Hollywood films. Technically, Asoka has few rivals. The cinematography is A-class and the editing crisp. Sivan's script is tightly woven with moments of passion and intrigue erupting at regular intervals keeping the viewer gripped. For all practical purposes Asoka is a winner, and comes through in style mesmerizing the audience with its spectacular visuals and searing their souls with its haunting portrayal of truth.",1006300800,13,2200,5.043956043956044

1657959,5,B00005RYQ6,"Santosh Sivan's newest feature is a beautifully stylized and executed film that is going to change the way the international public views Hindi films. The film explores the life of Emporer Asoka, from his early naive days to his accepting of Buddhism. In the middle is his quest for power, and how he would even kill people to become the winner of a violent war. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant as Asoka; he embodies all characteristics of the man, and such a role is not easy to play. Kudos as well to Kareena Kapoor, who easily turns in an award worthy performance. The real star here though is Sivan's masterful camerawork. Excellent music by Anu Malik. International version runs thirty minutes short, minus most of the songs.

1657997,4,B00005RYQ6,"When monsters become monks, it's usually the stuff of legends. But Asoka--a bloodthirsty emperor who later renounced violence--was a real person. The 2001 film 'Asoka,' about his early life, captures in mesmerizing fashion how such an unlikely conversion could take place.

Asoka was the favorite grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, the emperor of the kingdom of Magadha in the third century BC. Chandragupta beat back the armies of Alexander the Great, conquered most of the Indian subcontinent, and then adopted the Jain religion, renounced his throne, and died from fasting. The empire fell to his son Bindusara, whose heir apparent was Asoka's eldest brother Susima.

And that's where the film begins. There's no trace of the Asoka who would one day convert to Buddhism and become one of the world's first great humanitarians, a man who made nonviolence the law of his vast land. Shahrukh Khan plays the young Asoka, a skilled and merciless warrior with ruthless political ambition, a role perfectly suited to Khan's intense dramatic style (he always shines as an antihero). Asoka is an animal in a kill-or-be-killed courtly world, but when he's temporarily exiled and gets mixed up with a woman on the run, Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor), his love for her humanizes him--and Khan and Kapoor make a scorching pair. When Asoka is falsely told she's dead, he's shattered, marries another--a Buddhist named Devi (Hrishita Bhatt)--violently assumes the throne, and becomes even more brutal than before. The story is bolstered by striking art direction, tight editing, and fantastic performances by supporting actors.

The lavish final battle scene--which included 6,000 extras--is refreshingly low-tech and all the more realistic as a result. The aftermath is gory and moving as Asoka searches among the corpses for his lost love. (According to historical records, Asoka was horrified by the magnitude of death he'd caused at the Battle of Kalinga, which prompted him to reform.)

There are a couple of detracting elements that break the film's powerful spell. The use of comedy is a distraction rather than a relief. That's not an indictment of masala--Bollywood's traditional blending of genres--but in this case, it doesn't work. The drama is too captivating to downshift out of it. Also, the songs seem too contemporary for a historical pic.

Finally, the film was criticized for its historical inaccuracies (Devi was actually Asoka's first wife; he married Kaurwaki later). The criticism is unfair to some degree given that it's necessary to take liberties with true stories in order to create a narrative arc, but since the film's explanation of Asoka's profound change doesn't jibe with the facts, his confounding transformation remains, unsatisfyingly, a mystery.

1658009,1,B00005RYQ6,This movie was just plain horrible! There was no historical accuracy and barely any fight scene (no that expect many from a Bollywood film).

1658010,4,B00005RYQ6,"""Asoka"" should probably be considered historical fiction.  It's based on the life of the real-life Indian ""Emperor of Emperors"", but as the opening text informs you, it is largely fictionalized.  I imagine the spontaneous song-and-dance numbers that pop up regularly would indicate that, but in case you are dense they tell you anyways.  The film is largely in the tradition of classic Asian war epics, but with that unmistakable Indian touch of whimsy and chaste sensuality.  More on that later.  The film runs the gamut of emotions from sheer joy to lust, violence, and stunning heartbreak.  It's an absolute tour-de-force from a country whose films are often the subject of parody and laughter in the West.  Nobody will parody this one.  ""Asoka"" is no joke and can easily be compared the China's wuxia classics.

The central theme of this very long and involving story is the way love can transform you.  The title character is the classic Prince who leaves his land to seek adventure as a commoner after his arrogant ways lead to his own brothers attempting to have him assassinated.  While Asoka is the baddest warrior in the land (possibly due to the influence of a demonic sword), he is led to self-imposed exile when his beloved mother, fearing for his life, takes a vow of lifelong silence until he leaves.  Shortly upon embarking, he encounters a vision of spectacular beauty: a green-eyed girl singing and dancing as she bathes in a waterfall.  And I have to say, there are few actresses in the history of cinema more instantly desirable then Kareena Kapoordebarking.  She puts on a hell of a show for the young prince (and the viewer) and upon meeting her peeper, quickly departs after a somehow charming threat of violence.  Naturally, the headstrong warrior is only more intrigued.  So begins his REAL journey.

One of the first things that struck me about ""Asoka"" was the low production values in the early scenes.  I'm hardly a film snob, but I'm just not used to a 2001 film that looks like a 1960's chop-socky flick.  Thankfully, I like me some chop-socky.  Quickly overlooked and forgotten as the quality seems to spike later.  More disconcerting however, is the occasionally shoddy recording of the voices for the musical numbers.  One likes for the film to maintain the illusion of the characters actually singing, but that's hard to do when the vocals occasionally sound like somebody held a tape recorder up to a vocalist's mouth to record the parts.  Bad news in a musical.  Thankfully, this is anything but an average song-and-dance affair and low-budget does not mean low-quality.

The musical scenes flow very well with the story most of the time.  Occasionally, there are random performances in bars or in the streets just for the fun of it to break up the action a little, but at least one does a great job of advancing the lead characters' relationship, which is great.  A few are completely unnecessary and one resembles a bad Latin pop video, but most are very enjoyable provided you are not dead inside and are still able to find some joy in life.  You'll walk away from this film with some catchy tunes in your head for sure.  And don't worry; there's bloodshed to offset all the hip-swaying, scatting, and sitars.  ""Asoka"" boasts some very nice action scenes.  Leading man Shahrukh Khan brings the noise when it's time to step up the cool factor.  The bit that impressed me the most involved a long flexible blade that he wielded as a whip. That is just sweet.  Another early scene where an assassin tries to take him down as he bathes in the river is made entirely out of bada$z.  While the middle of the film focuses entirely on romance, in the end Asoka returns to the battlefield with a vengeance and inflicts much harm in some large-scale battles that portray the horrors of war.  Seeing a man collapse in despair on a pile of severed limbs, corpses, and blood covering the ground is just the kind of image that strikes right to the core of the matter.  And when it comes down to it, the film pulls no punches.  The final act is overflowing with bitter irony and tragedy of the worst kind.

As I said, the theme of ""Asoka"" is love's ability to change us from the inside.  It strikes at the very core of our being and few who have experience it can deny this.  Seeing love transform the arrogant, ambitious, violent prince first into a smiling happy-go-lucky boy who wants nothing more then peace, then into a brutal tyrant who cares for nothing, and finally a Buddhist legend -all over the woman he loves- is just amazing.  The story is a work of art and unassailable.  I always enjoy a peep into an exotic culture as well.  In this case, I spent time pondering India's must-vaunted sensuality.  The clothing is often exceptionally skimpy, the ladies sway their hips in the most provocative ways, lovers caress each other, the lyrics are suggestive, one song's verses are punctuated by a teasingly breathy rhythmic sigh,  and the music itself has a sexually inviting aura to it.  And yet there is no kissing and certainly no actual love scene to be found in spite of the fact that so much of the film is focused on desire and sexual tension.  This is largely due to the conservative values of India and the fact that intimate displays of affection including kissing are viewed as indecent.  That's right; the culture that brought us the Kama Sutra is uptight about kissing.  Watch for it in this one.  Sexual thoughts and feelings pervade nearly every scene, but that tension is never released.  In Western cinema, that is nearly unheard of.  In India, it's practically the law.  Other cultures are truly fascinating.

Pointless observations aside, ""Asoka"" is an absolute must for fans of epic Asian cinema.  Even Western film fans should give it a try.  You never know, you might like it.  There's an whole world of film outside of America and more often then not, it kicks our tail.  This was the first Bollywood flick I've seen and it's unlikely to be the last.  In spite of the epic length, the story is pretty well paced and the platter of entertainment it serves has something for everybody.  There's some classic comedy, killer action, despair and heartbreak, romance for miles, sexiness for days, endearing characters, and a brilliant message.  ""Asoka"" is a great film by most any standard and you oughtta give it a shot.

1658013,5,B00005RYQ6,"Are you up for something completely different, something the likes of which I guarantee you have never experienced before? A film that has the lush aura of Franco Zefferelli's Shakespearean films combined with the extavagent sets of Liz Taylor's CLEOPATRA mixed with the whimsy of Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE?  You say no such animal exists? Well my friend, you are wrong!

That film is ASOKA which stars the legendary Shah Rukh Khan who is undoubtedly the most worshipped romantic leading man in the world of cinema today--bar none. I was going to say that he was the most lusted after, which is probably true as well, but there is something about SRK, as he is known, that seems to evoke an even more powerful emotion in women than mere lust. He is Rudolph Valentino, Gene Kelly, and, when he needs to be, Douglas Fairbanks. He's all of those and more, he's an original. And he's a very important part of what makes this film work so well.

There is so very much in this film to like aside from Khan that I hardly no where to begin. The cast is all superb, especially his co-star the incredibly beautiful Kareena Kapoor who plays Asoka's love interest the Princess Kaurwaki, she couldn't be more believable as the woman for whom he would gladly give up a throne. The sets and costumes and sets are gorgeous and whether or not they are true to the time period couldn't concern me less since the director's approach to this film seems to be more that of a romantic fantasy that of an historical documentary.

That brings us to the one element that sets Bollywood pictures apart from Hollywood films, the musical numbers! (Remember I said SRK had a little Gene Kelly in him.) The fact that anyone can burst into song and dance for no apparent reason at any given moment is one of the things I like best about Bollywood movies. There is so much joy and exuberance in these numbers that sometimes I just want to get up and dance myself, but since I look nothing like those pretty girls with their bare midriffs I've managed to restrain myself, so far. I know what you're thinking, but really after you get accustomed to it the songs won't bother you at all. In fact you might even like them. They're sort of a combination of folk and pop, and they're very catchy. I've always liked ""foreign"" folk music so I fell right into it.

But what about the story, you say. The story is mostly fiction based on fact. There was a man named Asoka who became a brutal monarch and then renounced his throne to spread the word of Buddha. He is in fact credited with having transformed Buddhism from a second-rate sect into a major world religion by sending forth missionaries. His personal life and his rise to power which are the subjects of this film,are the stuff of myth and legend. But that's always where the best stories are.

The dvd begins with a crawl that fills us in a tiny bit on the importance of the the man in the story we are about to see which is very helpful for those of us without any background in Buddhism. And our story itself begins with Asoka's grandfather the Emperor Chandragupta Mauya giving away all his possessions to the people prior to embracing his new life as a Jainist monk. Asoka is just a young boy and doesn't understand his grandfather's choice, nor does he understand when his grandfather tries to stop Asoka from keeping his sword for himself. His grandfather tells him that the sword is a demon and that once it is drawn it sees neither friend nor foe it only thirsts for blood, and that he should throw it away before it can do anymore harm. Asoka refuses, so his grandfather grabs it from him and throws it in the river himself, then leaves on his journey with the other monks. If only Asoka had left the sword in the river, but he doesn't. If only he had not drawn it, but he does. If only he learned from that first bloody lesson, but he doesn't.

There is plenty more to Asoka's story, the film runs well over 2 and 1/2 hours, but in that time it manages to pack in adventure, romance, comedy, drama, one really good battle scene and a couple of small skirmishes, plus song and dance numbers that run the gamut from free wheeling fun, to sensual and exotic desire. My God, how much more do you want from your first Bollywood experience!

1658015,2,B00005RYQ6,"Avoid this movie. There are dozens of other Shahrukh Khan movies far better than this one, and many more beautiful Indian actresses rather than Kareena Kapoor. The biggest problem with this movie is that its an insult to one of India's most revered leaders. Its like making a movie about George Washington complete with hiphop music and the story ends before he becomes president. If you go to Wikipedia and look up Ashoka, you'll see that he has a powerful influence even on modern day India and Buddhism. Unfortunately, someone thought they could make a buck by condensing a small part of his life into a action/romance. Its just terrible. The singing and dancing are totally inappropriate. The battle scenes are small and a bit cheesy. The story is very confused (which woman does he love? why is he killing his brothers? why is he attacking Kalinga, why was he wandering around in Kalinga by himself incognito to start?), but less so if you read the real story to find the ""backstory"". And at the end, when I thought maybe it has some redeeming value where it shows Ashoka's great transformation, it suddenly ends. Its just garbage. If you want to see Khan in his glory see Khabie Kushie Khabe Gum, Dil Se or even Devdas. At least those have better songs, better dancing, appropriate musical interludes, better story, emotional arc, better costumes, and better family values and sense of romance. This movie was just about making a quick buck, and Khan should be ashamed to be a part of it.",1183334400,4,1494,4.727969348659004

1658018,3,B00005RYQ6,"This is a movie about the Indian ruler Asoka, a significant figure in the history of Buddhism. As is apparently typical of Indian movies, ""Asoka"" is longer than your average Hollywood movie and includes lots of musical numbers.

I rented the video hoping it would be an entertaining way to learn a little more about Buddhist history, so I was disappointed that the movie ends with the bloody conquest that led to Asoka's embrace of Buddhist ideals. Like another reviewer, I want to see ""Asoka, Part Two.""",1168732800,2,504,4.793103448275862
1658029,5,B00005RYQ6,"I am absolutely spellbound by this masterpiece. The movie starts well, it gets slow in the middle where the love story goes on but then takes enormous pace when the King Asoka starts his killing spree because he was completely broken by the loss of his beloved mother and his lover. Also he was told by his brother that to become Great he has to kill people which he wanted to be.

The acting by Shahrukh khan is exceptionally extraordinary and I don't think anybody in the entire world could have overtaken him. Initially I doubted his ability in that role but it changed after I saw the movie. He brings so much intensity and ferociousness into the character as if he is the real Asoka.

(Few people have been complaining for the movie having some songs numbers. But I like the movie for what is good in it, forget the songs. Thats the meaning of true liking. See the bright side and ignore everything else. Others are just trying to give a review and I am saying that I liked it and here is the reason)

King Asoka is my Hero now, because of a point-When he held a sword he was matchless in that capacity and when he dropped it he is again matchless as a good man(a great life indeed).",1167955200,4,1188,4.318385650224215

I really have no knowledge of the actual Asoka, so I just approached the film as a fiction film (reportedly, it's very inaccurate, proving not just Hollywood fabricates historical epics).  This is really an exceptional film.  It's beautifully shot (the director, Santosh Sivan, is also a cinemtographer, and his photography and framing are immaculate), and, thankfully, there are only 5 songs in the entire film.  The songs don't really blend into the narrative, but there are generally well done.  The love story is very silly, but silly love stories are the norm in Bollywood.  A pretty good film, and its 168 minute running time (rather short for a Bollywood film, and the cover box says 150 minutes....it's wrong) doesn't feel padded, like a lot of Bollywood films do.",1159488000,2,833,5.0

The story is not supposed to be completely factual. A disclaimer at the beginning says the movie will just give an idea of what kind of journey Asoka took in life. Although the movie was long, the scenery was beautifully shot, and the acting was believable enough. The breakouts into musical segments was a little different for me, and did not always flow into the plot very well, but the music videos were sensual and entertaining in their own right. I got used to them quickly. My wife on the other hand was irritated by them, and gave up on the movie early on. So, it's not for everyone, but if you're open-minded to try something different and not at all offensive, I highly recommend this DVD.",1158624000,3,1001,4.597765363128492
1658033,5,B00005RYQ6,"I didn't really know what to expect going into this film (I'm embarassed to say that I even teach occasional film classes and had never seen a true Bollywood film, only read about them) -- I knew it was a Bollywood Blockbuster, and one of only a few that had wide success outside of India.  For that reason I wonder about how characteristic this film is of Bollywood film generally -- but that is I suppose an odd question: like seeing Star Wars or Jaws or The Titanic only and asking ""is this what all Hollywood films are like?""  But judging on this film alone there is a whole new world of film to explore, and I'm excited to take the leap.

The story of the famous warrior king Asoka who became a Buddhist missionary for peace, it starts out beautifully, and one gets the sense this will be an epic film in the style of Hollywood epic melodrama.  Then, when he has left his homeland and gone wandering he catches the eye of a beautiful young woman, things change suddenly and one gets the sense this is nothing like a Hollywood film.  The vast scope of the film narrows and instead of lush and broad period backgrounds we get closeups of navels and hips, and it becomes a fiery dance number, with dance moves inspired by ancient Hindu love texts and diagrams (think Kamasutra style without sex: on the documentary included on this disc the choreographer said that diagrams from the Kamasutra as well as other early Hindu texts provided inspiration for some of the dance moves).  The epic story resumes quickly but is ""interrupted"" several times by bizarre but catchy and infectious dance and song numbers, that appear a peculiar hybrid between Broadway, MTV and  traditional dance.  After I got used to such scenes they grew on me and I found myself smiling and laughing in ways that I rarely do watching a Blockbuster Hollywood film.  Even though some (not all) of the dance/music scenes are erotically charged there is a remarkable innocence about them that hearkens back to early Hollywood musicals -- and I think my response to these numbers (partly due to the unexpected novelty) was close to what it must have been like to experience great Hollywood musicals as they emerged and not through the jaded eyes of a filmgoer whose experience is with films that have ""grown out"" of such styles.  In its epic mode, too, the film has a grandeur that is rarely approached in Hollywood epics today (and does not solicit the same kind of cynicism at least for me that seems an appropriate response to films like ""Alexander""), and comes perhaps closer to Kurosawa films like Ran.  Another connection to Kurosawa is in color -- though I think that where this film falls short of the Japanese master is in the editing which sometimes feels a bit too contrived (comparable at times to MTV style editing: cutting for a preconceived effect rather than cutting to create an organically seamless unity).",1146614400,4,2893,4.664047151277014
1658034,4,B00005RYQ6,"Asoka should be applauded for trying to take Bollywood to another level. Although it didn't have the financial success it deserved, the movie is completely watchable, a love story set amongst beautiful scenery and historical settings.

The beginning of Asoka is exciting and adventurous, with Asoka battling numerous adversaries (including his brothers) against a backdrop of temples, castles, and rivers. Asoka then is exiled and leaves the kingdom. He meets the princess Kaurwaki and adopts the guise of a commoner. Here, the story turns into one of romance. There is the obligatory dancing. This is sufficient ""down time"" before the movie once again picks up the pace, driving straight into more rousing battle scenes.

Kareena Kapoor does a good job as the princess Kaurwaki. She manages to be commanding, tough, and sensual all at once. I must also commend Shahrukh Khan's performance - he deviates greatly from the other roles he has portrayed in previous movies. The thing that stops me from giving this film 5/5 stars is the seemingly random song/dance numbers. They seem completely unrelated to the mood of the movie, and they could definitely go into the trash.

Overall, Asoka is great. It has great performances by all involved; it is exotic, appealing, sensuous, epic, and beautiful.",1145232000,,1296,5.161904761904762
1658035,4,B00005RYQ6,"Most of what people know about Asoka is pure fantasy.  For example, it is widely believed that Ashoka, out of disgust and sorrow over all the blood he shed, renounces violence and becomes a Buddhist.  The details about this, however, comes from text written several hundred years after his death.  Historic fact is that he probably did not become a Buddhist, and he became the model emperor in order to peacefully consolidate his conquests.  If he had renounced violence and was sorry for what he had done, why did he not return the land he had taken?  Any good history book will clarify this.

Now, about the film:

The film Asoka takes the fantasy, and fantasizes about it, creating a whole new level of fantasy, which is the story the film follows.  It is pure Bollywood melodrama:  boy meets girl, they fall in love, they get separated, boy thinks girl dies, boy eventually remarries, invades her country, and fights her army in  battle.  Okay, the last bit doesn't fit any of the normal formulas.

Having said all of that, if you accept that almost nothing of the  story is at all factual, and that it is a ""heightened emotional drama"", as is the usual case with Indian films, then Asoka is quite an enjoyable film.  The story has its own interest, and the song and dance bits are fascinating.  The cinematography is quite good by Bollywood standards.  So, judging it purely on the basis of its own story, and by the expectations of a Bollywood film, I give it four stars.",1141516800,,1477,4.601532567049809

This is a highly stylized version of Asoka, the Indian emperor or king, who is responsible for spreading Buddhism outside India. Asoka was an ambitious king, who underwent a fundamental transformation after he converted to Buddhism. He switched from an ambitious king, to a peace-loving and kind king. At least this is what you read in history books.

This film is based on the life of Asoka, but fails to do justice. One of the reasons could be that Shah Rukh Khan was probably not the right person to be cast in this role. He somehow did not fit the picture. The film was disappointing, and a tad too long for me. I can sit through 3 hours of a regular Indian film, but had problems sitting throught this film. Somehow the film failed to grab my attention. I think somehow the real meat of the story got lost in the stylized translation of the story.",1130889600,,920,4.542168674698795

Aside from being the movie that first introduced me to Mr. Bollywood Bad Shah, Shah Rukh Khan, what endeared me to Asoka was the way this film has beautifully weaved the story of one of India's revered historical figures. I thought this movie has given Asoka a more lively dimension, which certainly lacked when I was learning about him during my undergrad years. We should be thankful for Shah Rukh for his awesome rendering of Asoka. I'm not a big fan of Kareena Kapoor, but he made their pairing work. Thus, even though the story made a little detour from the actual tale, it was a refreshing change to me. I didn't expect too much prior to watching this film, aside from being interested on how Asoka's life is going to be portrayed in celluloid, but it has opened me up to the exciting, romantic, colorful world of Bollywood.

I was most impressed with the performance of Kareena Kapoor who portrays Princess Kaurwaki. I was amazed how effortlessy she was able to switch from silly to serious to dancer throughout the movie. She steals every scene she is in. ""King"" Khan who portrays Asoka/Pawan is also just as compelling. The dance numbers are also great. I'm still humming some of the tunes in my head.

1658053,4,B00005RYQ6,"emotional and yet hugely entertaining movie anymore.  And it NEVER did any movie quite like this one. An historical piece with a serious theme, but, look here's a song and dance number featuring a kooch girl enthusiastically rotating her hips and another number where the hero and heroine twine sensuously  around each other amid tons of mist a la MTV.  And, yet, it works! By all the laws of western cimena it shouldn't.  But we aren't dealing with western cimena here.  This is Bollywood!

I've seen only a few other Bollywood movies and I must give kudos to this one in particular for its female characters.  There isn't one silly twitchy ingenue in the whole movie.  All three of the main female characters, Asoka's mother, his lover and his wife, are strong, each is a unique and interesting individual and each in her own way gives this movie its moral balast. I am so impressed.

Also, the actor playing the Emperor Asoka is a hunk and a half.  And he can act.  Even when his character becomes vicious and violent, you continue to care about him and not just because he's pretty.

However, I did knock off one star for the really dreadful ""comic relief"" scenes with the three guards whose dialog always reveals that one of the guard's wives is unfaithful without that guard being aware of it.  If the director ever decides to cut those totally unnecessary scenes, I will up my rating to five stars.",1111276800,4,1405,4.616935483870968

The dance sequences were upbeat with modern mixed with primitive style. The music was catchy and still had such a great Indian flavor. The two main actors were involving to watch. The movie has a Bollywood feel yet I think it is more contempary than some of the others I have seen. The film flashes with the music creating a unique picture. It sometimes reminds me of a music video. The actress who plays Kariwake has the most beautiful eyes and gives her character a spice and anger that makes her quite interesting.
  The movie is about a prince who wanted to sit on his fathers throne yet had to compete for this with his stepbrothers. Asoka was playful and could be seen as a big child yet he could be vindictive and cruel. He had a lust for blood as the movie had shown us at the beginning yet he had a grief and sadness after violence was inflicted. He was human and the film I think portrayed this.
  He ends up leaving his home on his mothers manipulation and trys to become an ordinary man. Yet his beauty and skill at swordplay and yoga moves set him out as something quite special. He falls for a beautiful young girl who I mentioned earlier. Karwaki is also royalty and is hiding from those that want her brother's throne. The romance sequences are rich with music, playful antics and color. The sex is left out for the imagination. They do not even kiss, which could be a bit dissappointing if you like to see this in a film. You can feel their hunger for one another yet it is not acted out.
  The film takes a dark turn after Asoka finds out that Karawaki has been murdered. His mother is murdered and thats when he explodes with anger and revenge. This part I found hard to sit through. I wanted the romance to continue and florish and it did not. It really never had a closure to me. I did see what the film was trying to aim for and I totally support it 100% The romance was pretty much through after he leaves Karawaki and somehow I wish that part could have been different. This is a long film, covering 150 minutes with a definate Bollywood feel. I liked it and give it 4 stars.

1658073,5,B00005RYQ6,"This is a wonderful film, with fun upbeat chreography, a love story and a fairy tale that will introduce you to the the amazing talents of the one and only SRK! Shahrukh Khan is hands down the most famous and loved man in the world. I relaize that if you live in the USA, you sadly may have never heard of him, but untold millions adore him.

If you combined Mel Gibson, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, a rockin' Gene Kelly, and an occasional pinch of the young Jerry Lewis - you might get somewhat close to describing Shahrukh Khan, or SRK as they call him in India.

I first saw SRK in ASOKA, and then discovered DIL SE. After that I was captured. I found this man so appealing that I started watching any and all of his movies. The cultural gap made some almost incomprehensible to me; but with time & patience, the films broadened my awareness of a world where 60% of the marriages are still arranged - and my love for SRK grew

It took me awhile to get comfortable with Hindi popmusic and Bollywood dance numbers, but that really didn't matter because I could not take my eyes off Shahrukh Khan. He has that kind of star quality - when he's in the frame, you don't see anyone else. His energy and joie de vivre fill up the screen, and your heart.

I had never ever been one of those who fell for movies stars and I wondered what it was that drew me into his magic. One fine morning it hit me like a ray of light - SRK is holding the Love Frequency on the planet.

What is it that everyone dreams of, longs for, works for, lives and dies for? Love. We all want to be loved by our families, friends, lovers, and by God.

Shahrukh is living Love - it's in his eyes, in every gesture from his hands and body. Love radiates from the treasury of subtle expressions on his sometimes handsome, sometimes ordinary, always wonderful face. He is what every woman wants - the passionate man every guy knows he could be. Brave, crazy, hilarious, tender, vicious, vulnerable, SRK can express multiple layers of human emotion in one smile.

For me, Shahrukh Khan is the greatest living actor in the world today. No one can hold a candle to him, because he is not a manufactured product of tyranny. He is its antithesis - he is all feeling, Love.

No one can portray all the phases of Love better than SRK. Shahrukh, a Muslim, is happily married to a gorgeous Hindu lady in Mumbai (Bombay). They have two children and SRK, a man who gets up close to the most beautiful women in the world, is infamous for being an absolutely faithful, loving husband. He believes in love. He courted his wife for seven years before her parents would allow the marriage.

In film love scenes, SRK is somehow tantalizingly chaste, and thus all the more erotic. The powerful energies of a tender fire are always building, and never quite come to completion to find release. Even his kisses - which are mostly bestowed upon lovely shoulders, arms, and necks - are holding something back, some mystery that makes you want him to reveal more.

Introduce yourself to Shahrukh with Asoka and then move on. The list of his some 50+ films is naturally varied. Because of cultural differences and traditions, some may not be easily appreciated by the western mind.

If Shahrukh Khan never becomes well known here in the USA, it will be our enormous loss. He is the genius of joy and living imagination, the finest living actor in the world, and more importantly, a light in our dark unraveling times. This self-described (his words) ""short man with dark skin"" is a veritable giant among men - and happily for us, currently holds the Love frequency on the planet.

COSTUMES:  glorious colours, elegant simplicity.  Loved those shawl-scarf things Shah Rukh wore - do you still call it a dupatta if a man wears it??
MUSIC: one of the highlights for me.  In spite of having the CD, and seeing clips on MTV ~I was unprepared for the lush, sumptuous sound, and exciting picturisation.
I would have loved MORE of the innovative underwater scene in Roshni Se - full of grace and romance and playfulness.
JEWELLERY:  wish they would manufacture a range of costume jewellery based on the Asoka designs!
OTHERS STARS: wholehearted participation, extremely effective, wellcast.
SANTOSH SIVAN:  a visionary in an industry of mediocrity.  (I wonder if he's met Francis Ford Coppola?)  God bless you Mr Sivan, and thank you from the bottom of my heart.
ENDING:  left me asking...then what?....then what?  Much the same as young Arya asking Asoka to continue his story-telling.  Leaves the door open for Asoka II?  God willing!  Are you listening Santoshji?
INTERVAL:  could have been timed a bit better - I had tears streaming down my face when the lights came on!
THE BOOK ON THE MAKING:  utterly stupendous...you gotta have it!
NEGATIVES:  From a western perspective and sensibility, which is all I can give you, I could have done without the ""three stooges"", which however maybe an inherent part of Hindi movies.  Also, I felt that young Arya took far too long to die!  Call me insensitive, but it seemed that scene dragged a bit.  And there were a few too many dismembered limbs lying around the battlescenes for my liking!
SHAH RUKH:  his voice richer and huskier than ever, is an imposing vision - he IS Asoka incarnate: imperious, majestic, romantic, sensitive, playful, every move and emotion a portrait of Grace, Truth and Sincerity.  Known for his legendary and unstoppable energy, Shah Rukh's moments of chilling stillness left me breathless at his versatility.
His intensity reminded me of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, one of the highlights of Hollywood history, in its time.  Martin at 35, was the same age in Apocalypse Now,  as Shah Rukh in Asoka.  Another highlight for me as Shah Rukh's sword-handling and one-on-one combat scenes - I could have watched that all day and all night.
After watching Hollywood-UK movies for over 45 years, I can honestly say this is THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE...till DEVDAS, which I also love for opposite reasons.",1060905600,7,2440,4.95320197044335
1658076,3,B00005RYQ6,"** SPOILERS AHEAD **
If you don't want plot details revealed to you, stop reading NOW!  My apologies to any Evelyn Wood Speed-Readers, whose training no doubt kicked in and they already read the rest of this review in a blink.
In case you don't know (I admit - I had to look it up), the term ""bollywood"" is a nickname for Bombay India, where they produce over 600 films a year - a number that puts the real Hollywood to shame.
For some reason, reviewers on amazon.com always seem to be much more generous than other sites that have user-submitted reviews.  On other sites, like MouthShut and Epinions, most of the reviews on Asoka are generally far less than favorable.  Most of these negative reviews complain about historical inaccuracies.
For example: 200 BC predates indigo dye, so everyone in that period should have been wearing some shade of brown. Bindusara had many wives and fathered over 100 sons. There is absolutely no evidence that Asoka murdered his brothers, in fact there is evidence that many of his step brothers were generals in his battle campaigns. There was no Princess Kaurwati and he never married her.  Yada. Yada. Yada.
Some people were even offended by this film, saying that it is blasphemy to suggest that the great Asokas' turning point was due to sorrow over the death of Ayra and the lust for a Kaurwati instead of the disgust over the senseless violence.
Well, sorry people, but if I wanted to see a movie where everyone wore drabby looking outfits, but is historically accurate, I'd go to the history channel.  This movie IS NOT a documentary.  Artistic license flows free!
With that said, I'll now clue you in on my REAL gripes about this film.  The DVD cover depicts Asoka with an army of extras riding on horseback to battle.  This image is obviously there to get guys to rent this movie.  But, in actuality, that scene encompasses only about 4% of the entire movie.  The other 96% is, more or less, a love story.
Which brings me to the actual story... I thought that the story itself was fair to good, and the dance numbers took me by surprise.  But, in time, I came to appreciate them if only for the breaks they provided in this emotional rollercoaster of a film.  The touches of humor in slow paced parts of the movie helped keep it flowing, but the second half of the movie seemed like a completely different movie from the first half.  The overall tone was more forboding and there were fewer song/dance numbers.
They used a very low bit-rate when they mastered the film for DVD.  This was so they could fit the entire 170 minutes (although the cover of the DVD claimed it was only 150 minutes long - an error that simply reflects poor quality) on a single layer DVD.  The result is VHS quality video.  They would have been better off presenting the DVD in 2.35:1 instead of 16:9, where the extra black space, that compresses to zero bytes with VBR, would allow a higher bit rate and better overall quality and still be single layer.  This would have also fixed a problem where text is truncated on both sides of the screen.  Another visual problem that could have been easily fixed was white subtitles over white portions of video were unreadable.  They should have used an outline font. I also did not like the way they divided the chapters on the DVD.  They divided the chapters by the beginning of each song/dance number instead of time based, so jumping to a scene does not work as expected.  This is used by the special features that let you jump to the songs, but the movie keeps playing after the song is through.  They could have easily mastered the DVD in such a way that each song had its own chapter, with other chapters based on time.",1057190400,49,3691,4.54380664652568
1658077,5,B00005RYQ6,"Asoka is a must see. All you pansies out there that think it is a good film but the music shouldn't have been there, having 5 songs in each Indian film is a style in Bollywood. Asoka is a better film than Gladiator or any other historical ""recreation"" The irony is unparalleled by any other film. The violent indians are fantastic, as well as the bellydancers. The characters could not have been pertrayed better by their actors. The film is worth the price and the price 100x over. A must see brawling epic.....",1055808000,3,512,4.516129032258065

RENT THE MOVIE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  True, the first 10 minutes were a bit boring but then the movie really takes off.  Also the songs and the wonderful acting by Kareena Kapoor adds to the list of reasons to watch this movie!
Great work!  Hope to see movies like this one from Subcontinent frequently!",1052438400,,409,4.426666666666667
1658079,5,B00005RYQ6,"A 150 minutes of humor, battles, blood covered swords and pretty females dancing.  Musical numbers, lovely landscapes, strong themes about peace, war, good and evil.  Following the development of Asoka from big mouth, spoiled, Prince to married man, then from warlord to man of peace is amazing and really pulls you into the film.  Nice extras, including a couple of behind the scenes featurettes.",1042761600,4,397,5.171875
1658080,5,B00005RYQ6,"Asoka inspires mixed emotions. On the one hand, there are elements of pure beauty and love and then you have a contrast in the horrors of war. The cinematography is rich and awe-inspiring. I was literally mesmerized.

This is not a romance in the sense of peace and love, this is a tragic tale of two hearts looking for one another amidst a world of betrayal and deceit. Not to mention a lust for power. The plot is complex and there are elements of revenge, cruelty and battles on a large scale.

The intensity in the contrast is at times overwhelming. The action never seems to subside into a moment of peace. Either passion dances across the screen or horror and suspense surround the characters. The musical numbers give some relief from the intensity, yet they are also equally vibrant.

This legendary story is recorded in a second century book called the ""Asokavadana."" The movie is based loosely on the story and at the end there is the implication of the renunciation of war.

""Love wounds in a way that does not let you live or die.""

It is emotional from the start and is dark in its lust for power and beautiful in its exotic swirling dance sequences. An almost mythological atmosphere pervades the film in places.

The story begins when Asoka's grandfather tosses his sword into a waterfall because the sword hungers for blood. As his grandfather leaves, Asoka searches for the sword and finds it.

When he is older his life is in danger. His mother, Dharma (Subhashini Ali), asks him to save his life by fleeing. After changing his name to Pawan, he meets Kaurwaki who is following a similar fate and is hiding out in the lush green countryside with her much younger brother Prince Arya.

Prince Asoka/Pawan (Shah Rukh Khan) and the feisty and sensuous Princess Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) imagine they have met before and Asoka calls her ""my warrior."" So romantic!

The story then dives into a crystal pool of the most primal instincts. A man fighting for a woman, a warrior woman fighting for her land. Splashes of color spread out against a pastel blue sky. Swords become a part of the characters as they fight for their lives. There is a reward for finding Kaurwaki as she is the daughter of the king of Kalinga.

When Asoka tells Kaurwaki:

""I couldn't put a price on you. The earth doesn't have enough gold for that.""

We know he is going to pay some terrible price for his love. They marry and just as soon as you think this story is going to move in a good direction, Asoka's mother calls him back and he is then sent off on a mission.

""What is this surge of love?
Do I drown to experience it?
Can you tell what it is?
Where could it lead?""

On his return, he is told that his true love is dead. Once convinced, his aggressive nature emerges. He has no reason to live and desires only death. This loss of love seems to make him lust for power as he has lost the influence of Kaurwaki's love. He then ascends the throne of Magadha in the 3rd century BC. When he decides to extend the borders of his empire, he wages a bloody war on Kalinga, a neighboring kingdom.

This review refers to a Widescreen edition. My only complaint was the extent of the violence in places and the subtitles were white and difficult to read at times. If you loved Lagaan, this movie is much more tragic.

The story of Asoka's journey from war to peace. A mingling of intense sensuality with the bitterness of war.

1658081,4,B00005RYQ6,"-- the phrase and the story of King Asoka (A1yu4Wang2) are found in classic Buddhist teachings familiar in many cultures (e.g., Chinese and Japanese) with Buddhism influence besides India. I watched the DVD with great anticipation and mostly satisfied. It has a true epic feel with exiled prince/princess, love, conspiracy, revenge, cruelty, great battles with elephants and... enlightment. It's like a biblical tale, albeit more subtle and less pedantic :) The acting and cinematography are impressive but the bollywood music and dance does distract from the story -- just imagine britney spear wearing quasi-period clothing breaks out dance numbers in contemporary beats from time to time in a remake of Ben Hur :).
The DVD (First Look) is in widescreen anamorphic video and DD 5.1 sound, BTW, as it's not mentioned. But the video quality is considerable worse (much more blurry with more interlace artifacts) than Lagaan, another recent Hindi film, which is longer than Asoka.
Recommended.",1039305600,3,992,5.32484076433121
1658082,5,B00005RYQ6,"Asoka is like gladiator, but with morals, awesome indian dance sequences, and the hottest girl in the world. you will be crying like you did for titanic (yes, that means you toughguy). True to Buddhist ideals, this is an epic and moving story.
You need to see it.",1038441600,2,263,4.5
1658083,5,B00005RYQ6,"I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. It has excellent action sequences and a great storyline.  This movie is about the great emporer Asoka who leaves his throne to spread Buddhism throughout India and the world. Historically, some of the movie is accurate.  In the beginning and the end of the movie, they specify which parts of the movie were reality and they let us know on the cover and during the beginning of the movie that some of the movie is dramatized.  The songs for this movie are worth listening to.  The acting of ShahRukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor is amazing, both of them fit their roles perfectly.  If you are tired of of Hindi movies with repetive story lines, you should definitely watch this movie!",1034812800,4,732,4.6434108527131785
1658084,4,B00005RYQ6,"I have been so very impressed and touched by this film. I only wish for a version that would enable me to turn off the ""Bollywood"" music scenes. The ""music video"" quality of these inserts is very silly and trite to western eyes. This film has geat quality, excellent casting, and an important message. It could have succeeded as a major western release without the musical vignettes.
I do love this film and will seek a way to edit it myself for my own use.",1034208000,,457,4.3882352941176475
1658085,3,B00005RYQ6,"The overall story line was great - I won't ruin it for you.  There are many poignant moments in the film.  I especially liked the ongoing story between Prince Arya (a little boy) and Prince Asoka, as well as the romance between Asoka and Kaurwaki.  Kaurwaki was a great character - feminine, beautiful and strong.  For me, her character was what really made the movie worth watching.
The description on the box might make you think that the action is very good - it's not.  Throughout most of the film, the sword fighting was really, really bad, comparable to the Lee Van Cleef Ninja movies.  The final battles were actually pretty decent though.
The music videos seemed almost totally out of place and peripherally related to the film.  When the first one hit, I had to rewind to see where did THAT come from?  I fast forwarded through the rest of them.
The cinematography was excellent, although the cameras did not seem to have wide angles to capture the beauty of the landscape.  Parts of the tape were lower quality, but this was not very noticable.
All in all, the movie has a great story line.  That's why even though it has shortcomings, I still recommend it.",1032998400,6,1167,4.594202898550725
1658086,4,B00005RYQ6,"I was browsing about in the DVD section of a local store when I found ASOKA. The cover, admittedly, was appealing, which would account for my hand reaching toward it eagerly. When I read the back and discovered that it had some connection to Buddhism, I decided to call up a friend who is studying Buddhism and make a night of it. I am most thankful that I did.
After the first ten to fifteen minutes I was groaning. I thought, ""Great, this movie is well over two hours long and we're going to be stuck watching a bad documentary with really poor picture quality."" My friend urged me to turn it off, but I resisted, and within another twenty minutes we were both hooked. I found the film to be irresistible.
ASOKA runs the gamut between humor and sorrow with grace. During the first half I often found myself laughing at a bit of dialogue or a quick facial expression. I'm sure the musical interludes weren't meant to be funny, but, well, they were and I don't think there is anything wrong with being amused by them. It added to the experience in a wonderful way and set it apart from other epics of its kind. The anger and despair of the second half was infectious. Prince Asoka was tormented and so in turn was the viewer.
Shah Rukh Khan can be credited with the success of this film. He covers vast emotional ground with the dignity of the royalty that he was portraying. I've rarely said that someone was a joy to watch, but, really, Khan was. A lot of the humor lies in the subtlety of his expression, in the carriage of his character, and he pulls it off wonderfully. Truly, I hope he makes more movies that are then available in the States.
I will stick with what I initially said, though. The picture quality throughout the movie seemed uneven to me. It started off rather poorly, improved, it would slip and then reclaim itself. I have no idea of why this might have been. But that's only a little complaint. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film.
All I can say is that I had an emotional reaction to this film after it was over and I knew immediately that I'd want to watch it again. Sometimes it's hard to understand why a certain film clicks with you, but you just accept it and recommend it to others, hoping they find/see the same thing that you did.",1032048000,4,2275,4.367924528301887
1658087,4,B00005RYQ6,"The mighty Asoka served as governor of two large Indian provinces in the third century B.C., both of them important seats of Buddhism. With a ruthlessness equal to that of his grandfather, Chandragupta, he set out to enlarge the kingdom he had inherited (in a bloody bid for the throne against the rightful king, his brother). In the ninth year of his reign, Asoka conquered the state of Kalinga in a grim and savage slaughter. ""In that conquest,"" he said,""150,000 were killed or maimed, but I did not exult like a conquerer..."" Instead, he was consumed by remorse and revulsion at the horror of war. The carnage of Kalinga found the conquering hero looking for a new meaning in life. The emperor ultimately embraced Buddhism - a new Asoka was born - and he used the machinery of his vast empire to spread the teachings of compassion and non-violence far beyond India...
This is what I knew of Asoka from my readings of Buddhism. Santosh Sivan's radiant film ends on the bloody battlefields of Kalinga, but need not (as one reviewer said) have gone even ten minutes longer. The depth of Asoka's regret and change are evident in his anguished features - and upon the agony-twisted face of Shahrukh Khan - as he kneels among the carnage he has wrought. One needn't be versed in Buddhist history - or much history at all - to understand this incredible transformation.
How much of this cinematic tale is drawn from historical fact anyway? Who cares as you are drawn into this grand Shakespearean take on a spiritual legend? And that's what it is, folks - positively Shakespearean. I wasn't sure that I liked the film until I had watched it a little longer, finding myself pulled deeper and deeper into the complications of the plot. Where else have we seen characters assuming other identities and making drastic turns when they believe their true love has died?
I've always been enthralled by cinematic sword fights, and ASOKA does not disappoint. He's good from the very beginning, but not too good to occasionally be the source of a few laughs. Later, when he finally demonstrates his skills as a warrior - and in the final bloody scenes as ""Evil Asoka"" - his fierceness is exhilirating! Even more impressive, however, was the battlefield appearance of the main female character, Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor). Utterly beautiful and baaaaaaaaaad on her white horse, she demonstrates that - lineage be damned - she truly does possess warrior blood.
As Mira Nair's MISSISSIPPI MASALA was the only ""Indian"" film I had ever seen, I wasn't really prepared for characters to suddenly burst out into song. Say hello to ""Bollywood""! - but it barely seemed distracting as the tale unfurled. As it was, such scenes only occurred about four times - and in the appropriate places (not unlike the emotive musical interludes in American films and television which help to sell a few million copies of the soundtrack).
The only minor annoyance in the version I saw was that the subtitles were often difficult to read in the more brightly-lit scenes (while the Widescreen provided ample empty space below for them to be placed).
Overall, I would consider ASOKA a worthwhile spiritual journey along the same lines as THE BURMESE HARP and IKIRU, but told as a Shakespearean opera with lots of awesome > < kicking.",1026172800,2,3291,4.826548672566371
1658088,4,B00005RYQ6,"Asoka is one long seduction, a film so visually stunning as to leave me slack-jawed in amazement. The female lead is heartbreaking and tough at the same time, the male lead is occasionally stilted but overall very good. The music of this film (I cannot find the soundtrack anywhere) stuck in my head for days. The movie goes full-throttle wonderful until the end- a major bit of coitus interruptus, if I dare say so. It ends, leaving you stunned and wondering what the hell happened to Karwauki and Asoka, and what the results of his philosophical awakening were. This film cries out for a sequel, or at least another ten minutes showing us the rest of the story.
All in all, it's fabulous, but be prepared to get mad when the ending leaves you high and dry. It's more than worth the frustration for the first song alone.",1025049600,5,821,4.554054054054054
1658089,4,B00005RYQ6,"Unfortunately, this otherwise terrific movie ends just at the point where Asoka loses it all, which is actually when he became a truly important figure in world history.  Though the events of his life are somewhat sketchy, we know that Asoka was a great leader of India in the third century B.C.--he seems to have lived from about 299 to 232 B.C.  The grandson of the Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta, who was one of the earliest patrons of Buddhism, when Asoka took the throne he led a savage military campaign which eventually united much of India and even extended as far as Afghanistan.  But after the particularly brutal conquest of the state of Kalinga, Asoka was consumed by remorse and gave up his warrior ways, devoting himself instead to the spread of Buddhism, which he achieved by bringing some uniformity to Buddhist edicts, sending out missionaries across much of Asia, the Middle East, and even into North Africa, and by having Buddhist maxims inscribed on stones and pillars that were then placed along main routes of the kingdom and along its borders.  Though the Mauryan dynasty and the vast kingdom he had forged did not survive long after his death, Asoka is credited with transforming Buddhism from a secondary sect into one of the world's major religions.
The appeal of such a story to a filmmaker is obvious, what with its combination of warfare and religious awakening.  Add in certain legends concerning his great love for the Princess Kaurwaki and you've got romance to add to the action and drama.  As if that's not enough, tack on the big musical numbers and the leisurely three hour pace that characterizes Bollywood and we're talking mega-epic.  Try to imagine Jerry Bruckheimer producing a collaboration between Baz Luhrmann and David Lean and you'll be nearly prepared to watch the movie.
The movie is basically divided into three acts.  It opens with Asoka as a boy, watching his grandfather cast a great sword into a river.  Asoka asks him why he does such a thing and is told that it is a demon blade, which demands blood whenever it is drawn.  Asoka fishes it from the water and discovers, to his own horror, the truth of these words.  Having grown into a willful and violent young man, Asoka represents a threat to his stepbrothers in their quest for the thrown and they try repeatedly to have him murdered.  By threatening to take a vow of silence otherwise, Asoka's mother forces him to flee the capital and hide out, incognito, in the countryside.  It's there that he meets Kaurwaki, who, along with her princely younger brother, is likewise fleeing dynastic mayhem in Kalinga.  The young couple alternately woo and war with one another until the fates split them apart.  Whether because of this separation, which Asoka comes to believe must signal Kaurwaki's death, or because it is his nature, Asoka embarks on his fratricidal path to the throne and the horrific wars that won him a vast kingdom.  Eventually though, confrontations with a loyal retainer before the battle with Kalinga and with Kaurwaki and her brother after the battle show Asoka the misery he has wrought and the monster he has become.  A few scant lines of text tell us the rest of the story before the credits roll.
Shahrukh Khan makes for a charismatic and soulful Asoka. Kareena Kapoor, daughter of one of India's great film families (I guess she'd be their Drew Barrymore?), is a captivating Kaurwaki.  Their tentative love affair consumes the long middle section of the film, before providing the tragic final impetus for Asoka's conversion.  It would seem to have made more dramatic sense to continue on with final act about Asoka's spiritual work, since that's what he's remembered for and since it would complete the arc of the film.  I guess though that the rather oppressive atmosphere of Hindu nationalism in India is such that it is somewhat risky to celebrate other religions in the way that this more natural storytelling would have entailed.
The only other quarrel I have with the film is that, on video at least, it was a little bit washed out and the subtitles were white and nearly impossible to read against a light background.  Hopefully at some point the film will get the quality transfer that it warrants.

1658092,4,B00005RYQ6,"I've seen a couple of Indian films before but not this one very good epic film from India! Bravo to the director and the cast for this marvelous film! It has a wonderfully well-crafted story/plot, great battle scenes, sword fight scenes (a bit too much kung-fu swordfighting a la Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a bit trite if you ask me) and amusing musical scenes (this is the first time in the film history that a major hero such as Asoka-playing both a good guy and bad guy singing and dancing; I would be surprised if Darth Vader would sing and dance in a musical version of Star Wars! LOL!). Although a couple interesting things that caught my eyes: it's the way Santosh Sivan applied his cinematographic skills to the film, even though he had his own cinematographer working with him; his camera work is astonishingly mesmerizing and strong, although he could have expand his scenery scope to show the landscape of India in the 3rd century BC and could rely on special F/X for it (the same way Ridley Scott showcased ancient Rome and the Empire's provinces in ""Gladiator"").
The performance of the cast is very good and well done; Shah Rukh Khan is excellent as Asoka and so is the beautiful and sexy Kareena Kapoor as the princess Kaurwaki. There are three guys in the film cleverly reminded me of the Three Stooges for interluding comic relief (perhaps Santosh Sivan is a fan of the 3 Stooges?). I think Shah Rukh Khan should try his movie role in America's Hollywood, he'll be good as Jackie Chan is.
Overall, the film is great, the only two negatives I have are the white subtitles (which sometimes is very hard to read against a bright background and half of the times, it's too quick in dialogue transition) and lack of special F/X to show ancient India in dramatic fashions a la Gladiator.
Go rent it. It's worth watching it.",1021161600,2,1838,4.623853211009174
1658093,4,B00005RYQ6,"I was not prepared to like Asoka better than Lagaan but I did.  Visually, the film was absolutely stunning.  The battle scenes in particular were magnificent.  The plot structure was intricate enough to sustain attention but direct enough not to confuse.  The philosophical messages conveyed are more subtle than one would expect.  On the order of the best Victorian love tragedies, the primary love story is one of barely missed meetings between the lovers, obscured identities and lost opportunities that result in appalling losses.  The musical sequences were not as appealing to me as the fighting sequences, frankly, but followed the common pattern of Indian films.  Visually, however, they were breathtaking at certain moments and although the lyrics were banal for the most part, there were flashes of great beauty.  As I am not fluent in Hindi, and only remember a little from a childhood spent in that part of the world, I basically saw the film through the prism of the subtitles.  (As is often the case, subtitles written in white virtually became invisible against light backgrounds. Surely this can be remedied with all of the sophisticated methods that are available nowadays!)  I enjoyed the swordplay and use of weapons enormously and found the combats far more realistic than many of the contemporary Chinese martial art scenes in historical films.
Ultimately, the message I found in the film may not be the one intended as the curious progress of Asoka's life gave him the opportunity to embrace a path of non-violence, love and peace AFTER he had gained total victory and consolidated his empire through the most relentless and pitiless warfare.  Obviously, an attempt is made to show that he was revolted by his excesses of violence and that his destruction of all whom he loved was the catalyst for his ultimate transformation.  A realist, however, would be more inclined to think that it is easy enough to become a wise and benevolent humanitarian after all obstacles and enemies have been cleared from one's path.  As a matter of fact, his saintly Buddhist wife, Devi, actually saves Asoka's life by killing a would-be assassin in a pinch, so there is not one character in the film who is consistently 'non-violent'.  Events dictate responses of violence or non-violence in this film, and indeed, Asoka himself only became a 'killing machine' after having survived over a dozen assassination attempts by agents of his siblings and after having lost his beloved mother and believing he had lost his first, abiding love to assassins.
As some one with a lifelong interest in comparative mythology, it is easy to see comparisons in this film between Asoka and the classical Indian tale of Shiva and Kali, mirrored in ancient tales from Mesopotamia and Canaan.  Asoka has a 'berserker's' concentration when he engages in combat, and once he has entered into that trance-like state where sword indeed becomes one with the arm and soul, he is oblivious to every one and everything until there is nothing left to kill.  The dance of life and death is beautifully portrayed and weaponplay is lyrical and hypnotic.  The violence on screen is implied rather than being shown graphically for the most part.  In this way, the film differs substantially from Japanese historical films about wars.  Although there is a great deal of killing, there are no tasteless scenes of violence.
As is so often the case in Indian films, there are comic characters who act as relief, although the film fundamentally is serious and very intense.
There are not that many films that I wish to see more than once, and thus not many that I wish to own.  If the price of this one were not so steep, I gladly would purchase Asoka.",1020988800,2,3719,4.92
1658094,5,B00005RYQ6,"Maybe this isn't the most intellectual summary of Asoka, but it was one I developed after asking Indian friends about the film and got a similar reaction.
Clearly this movie is split into two parts.  The first involves Asoka's incognito journeys though the Indian wilderness in a sequence much like a vision quest.  The second is a good deal more serious.  Sparks between the two main players are flying everywhere.  Although with English subtitles, watching the film doesn't get tedious as there is so much action and visual beauty.
Americans might find the musical numbers a la Michael Jackson't Thriller a little odd if not laughable, but overall this is a good film for anyone who's never before seen Indian filmmaking (it's the biggest film industry in the world).",1020124800,,769,4.937984496124031

Those who say that the movie is not historically correct are missing the whole point.if you want history you better watch the discovery channel.
 The movie starts with the young prince, Asoka when he escapes from his own kingdom to please his mother who fears for his life from his evil brothers. He wanders around and meets a girl with whom he falls in love. The rest of the film is about his journey on the way to become one of the greatest known emperor of all times.
 The movie is basically a love story and is very sensitively handled by the director. Especially the last scene where he gets transformed is enough to bring tears to the eyes.
 Santosh Sivan has done tremendous work and he should be proud of it. Kareena Kapoor also has done a great job and by far the best thing she has done uptill now. But the star of the whole show is Shahrukh khan. Those who have earlier criticised his acting will now beat the dust. Along with Dil Se, this film should be a landmark in his career, which shows his growing up as an actor. The way in which he brings Asoka to life should make any actor feel proud.
 At the end of the movie,the scene which will remain in my memory is Asoka standing,staring in the sky, rain washing away his tears.",1018742400,15,1426,4.270370370370371

7952832,5,B00005RYQ6,The very first bollywood movie that I watched. Stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. The story delineates the life of Prince Asoka from the Chandragupta Maurya empire in India.,1449964800,,179,5.0
7952833,5,B00005RYQ6,"The climax in ""Asoka"" is the most moving I have ever seen in a film!  Beautifully - filmed and written, the movie opens with the then - future Indian king leading a triumphant campaign against an army from Takshila.  The viewer goes on an emotional and spiritual journey with Asoka that, eventually leads him to convert to Buddhism.  As King, he brings devastation and slaughter to the city of Kalinga and, when he visits the 'killing fields', he is filled with remorse and, while he does not renounce the throne as did his grandfather, Chandragupta, Asoka becomes a follower of Buddha and decides to rule with righteousness (dharma), instead of with instruments of war.  This wonderful film even includes Bollywood music sequences.  But, as the story progresses, the movie takes on a darker mood as a major battle looms closer.  At this point, singing and dancing is noticeably absent; they give way to the tragic aftermath of war, not just among humans, but war elephants and war horses as well.  For Indian actor, Shah Rukh Khan, his portrayal of Asoka is the best performance of his career.",1443052800,,1094,4.818181818181818

(if it makes you feel better, Christianity hadn't been invented yet).  The movie would have gone a lot faster if there were not song and dance routines every five minutes.
