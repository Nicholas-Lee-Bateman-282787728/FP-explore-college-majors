8024941,5,B0002A2W86,"A must for every Chekhov fan, this project captures the essential 'feel' of his characters and of the Russian upper middle class world he portrayed to us, without stealing, as far as I am aware, any of his dialogue or situation. A genuine, authentic masterpiece.",1405814400,2,262,4.844444444444444
8024942,5,B0002A2W86,"By far thee best Chekhov film put on camera to date.  You want to learn how to bring Chekhov's words to life? You want to learn if anything ""really happens"" in a Chekhov play? You want to learn about subtext and awkward pauses? Buy this film.",1392508800,,242,4.260869565217392
8024943,5,B0002A2W86,"A comedy in the broadest sense, looking squarely at human foibles.  Most productions of Chekhov come off as tragedies rather than comedies.  This production hits just the right balance, despite some obvious film-school touches.  The only other example I know is Louis Malle's ""Vanya on 42nd Street"" (in English).",1364774400,2,312,5.326530612244898
8024944,5,B0002A2W86,"I love Anton Chekhov's plays and I love Nikita Mikhalkov's films. The script has characters that could have been written by and a setting that could have been imagined by Chekhov. For me, it plays out to it's end in a most satisfying manner. With gentle humour and drama, the characters reveal the ordinariness of their lives, which we in the audience relate to wholeheartedly. Thank you Nikita and company.",1362268800,,407,4.828571428571428
8024945,5,B0002A2W86,"Seems to be definitive.  If you like Chekhov's writing and want to see it rendered beautifully on film, I highly recommend this movie.  No complaints.",1356652800,,150,4.96
8024946,5,B0002A2W86,"When I lived in Moscow, I was fortunate to see a revival of ""Platonov,"" Chekhov's first play written at age 19. When it was rejected, he tore it up. But a copy was found in the 1920's and revived. Then on Moscow TV I watched Nikita Mikhalkov's great adaptation of it. It is so typical of Chekhov's images of the despondent and pointless life of Russian gentry in the late 19th century. It is full of contrasts at that time; fascinating, intellectual, and boring. The Russians in this pivotal time in Russian history seemed to find much in common and Chekhov is very much in style today. I have many favorite scenes.

8024947,5,B0002A2W86,"I would never have come across this film if I hadn't seen it in my acting class. We were getting ready to tackle Chekhovian drama, and the professor made us watch it to acclimate ourselves with the pacing and psychology of these Russian characters.
As it began, I thought little of it - the characters seemed pointless and the plot stagnant. But I was trying very hard to see past my initial disinterest and to figure out what it was about these characters that has made Chekhov's work so timeless.
As the film pushed forward, I realized that (unlike American drama) the story was not at all plot driven, but character driven. If you try to define a movie like this by explaining what happens, you'll go nowhere fast. The actors, however, go through such profound experiences that the film sucks you in, and you hang on to every word.
The performances in this film are nothing short of masterful, and I couldn't recommend it more!!!
It's out there, floating in obscurity, but it's undoubtedly one of the best films (English or Foreign) that I've ever seen.",1191542400,7,1056,4.652406417112299
