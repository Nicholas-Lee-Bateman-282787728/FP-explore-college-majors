But I have really enjoyed this series, ""Fight! Dragon"".  It's a fast paced 24 minutes per episode and ends with a cliffhanger, so it's a continuing serial.  After watching the first 8 episodes so far, I logged on to Amazon to see how others are enjoying this series, I was really surprised to find only 1 review, and that it had such a poor rating.  I don't understand.  The show was filmed on location with really good cinematography. The stunts and fights are very enjoyable.  The picture and sound are good and for the low price this is a treasure for anyone looking for classic Japanese TV!  Give it a chance and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I have.",1275696000,7,815,4.357615894039735
8386476,1,B00310PSU8,"First let me say i am a fan of Yasuaki Kurata. I am not a fan of this tv series by him. Just for your information, the DVDs have original Japanese audio (As it should be in my opionion) with English subtitles. It has no English dub, and i am glad for that. Even though it says on the Amazon page here it has English audio, it does not. I actually tried to update 3-4 times, but for some reason they did not accept it. Strange.

Now, on to the series. I must say a was disappointed by this show. Seems like they did little to no restoring of the picture quality. I also disappointed of the fight scenes, sound effects in the fights and the silly undercranking they sometimes use in the fight scenes. You also get the same song each time a fight scenes occurs. You get tired of it after a couple episodes.

This stories are also very repetive in my opinion. I mean in story wise. This series won`t wind any awards for stories, acting and fight choreography. I think the fights which have like 3-5 fights in each episode, looks not good. I think the choreography looks too simple most of the time.  You can see in nearly every fight that Kurata doesn`t connect the punches and kicks to the villains. Didn`t they have monitors back in the 70`s?

Maybe not, but they clearly had dailies to watch so they should have re-shot figths that you could clearly see that Kurata didn`t really hit that person, just the air. I guess 1 thing that is good, is that this series was cheap. I won`t watch this again. This series is not recommended by me unless you like simple choreography and disappointing fight scenes.",1271376000,2,1601,4.3624161073825505
