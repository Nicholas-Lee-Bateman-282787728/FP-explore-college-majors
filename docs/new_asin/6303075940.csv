549690,5,6303075940,"This video was used in an exercise physiology class I attended, with the stated goal being to show how exercise can incorporate fun through the lifespan. The younger members of the class--in their late twenties and early thirties--pooh-poohed the idea that any exercise in which participants were seated had the potential to physically challenge people of their age. By the end, they admitted that their initial impression was wrong.

The video starts out relatively slow, with a seated version of that classic dance from the 1920s, the charleston. This is only for a warm up. If my class's experience is at all typical, this warm up was fun, with some of the exercise effect coming from the group's collective belly laughter as we all made fools of ourselves to varying degrees.

Part of the physiological challenge comes from the instructor's demonstration of how seated exercise--what she calls ""chair dancing""--can be made more challenging, to address the fitness level of individual participants.

I found it refreshing to see pretty much the full age range in the video's participants, from pediatric to geriatric--and best of all, everyone appears to be having fun. This unself-conscious participation by her audience is part of the what may be the unique charm of this video.

If you are looking to accommodate persons with a wide range of fitness and don't want to leave anyone out, this video may meet your needs.

If you are someone with special activity needs--elderly, chairbound, obese, or just not all that coordinated--this video will bring a smile to your face as you take steps to increase your activity level.

If you just want to have fun while you get a decent workout, you won't be disappointed, either.",1116374400,12,1725,5.013986013986014
549691,5,6303075940,"Jodi Stolove is awesome.

We are 'treated' to the benefits of yoga in this exercise video, another entry in her 'chair' series. With it, people who do not have a full range of motion can exercise and partake in a series of 'yoga-esque' type movements.

I work with a number of people and we do this WEEKLY. They adore it, and I adore Jodi for having yet another winning video that works to ENABLING people to reach to their potential, physical limitations be darned.

Jodi, you ROCK!",1107734400,3,483,4.528735632183908

549693,5,6303075940,"My 5 year old daughter and I love working out to this video because it is fun and a good way to get a different kind of work out.  It is a great motivator for people with any kind of disability or hardship.  I have severe asthma and find this video to be just right for me at this time.  The video has regular pulse checks in it and I am always on target while doing the exercises in it... at least 120 or above.

The video instructor is very easy to follow and the participants on the video are grouped by easy to challenging, so that you know from the beginning who to watch in order to model your own workout level on.  I love that all different kinds of body types and fitness levels are represented on this tape.  These folks are so much easier to follow than ultrafit robots who have never struggled to touch their toes or catch their breath in their lives!

For all of the above reasons, I recommend this video highly.",1094860800,14,925,4.162921348314606
549694,5,6303075940,"Excellent video! I was skeptical at first about chair dancing but this made me a firm believer fast! Jodi Stolove is fantastic. Her workout is geared to three different levels and is fairly enjoyable to do. Sure, it can get a little ""nerdy"" but the terrfic aerobic and bit of toning that you get from doing this workout is worth it!!

 I am a very large woman and mobilty is an issue so I was sure that I wouldn't get mouch from this tape bu tI was wrong! It took me a while but I have gone from level 3 to almost always doing level 2 of her tape and there is still room to improve!

549923,5,6303075940,"Nice exercise video of all sitting exercises. Challenging if you work at it but easy enough for nearly anyone. Mom can't stand long and worries about falling. She had a sit and be fit video which she liked but they did a lot of standing stretches she had to skip. This one is all sitting and can be modified to make it easier or harder. Mom barely moves her hands and still gets a better work out than just sitting there. She is getting better too. I did it with her using the advanced moves and couldn't keep up!! Amazing what a workout you can get sitting down.  Cuing is clear although not much warning given for changes, you'll have to do it a few times to get the hang of it. Production quality is good. Music is quiet and in the background really. That's bad if you want to hear it and dance but good because it doesn't hide instructor's voice. They use paper plates but you can do it empty handed. Advanced exercisers might even use a one pound weight though I wouldn't try it the first time thru. Nice instructor and mixed class of young, old, pregnant, overweight and 'regular' people.",1486857600,7,1094,4.362745098039215

I had foot surgery and wanted to maintain some condition. The ""Sit and Be Fit"" series from the library was dull and slow. This is much better.

551061,5,6303075940,"I am an avid fan of Jodi's Chair Dancing (the dancing, the strength training, yoga, and stretching...).

I am morbidly obese, so I have added movement. In addition to this video, I have her original Chair Dancing, Simply Stretch and a yoga one.  I also have her Sit Down and Tone Up original, More Sit Down and Tone Up, and Sit Down and Tone Up Encore. I alternate between the two chair dancings I have and More Sit Down and Tone Up, and Sit Down and Tone Up Encore, and sometime throw in a Simply Stretch.  I have since toned quite a bit... ""bye-bye"" arm area is firming, I am getting a butt (!), and the upper inner thighs are toning, among other bits and pieces.

I like the Through the Decades, it is fun and little cheesy. Not as cheesy as the first Chair Dancing video. I welcome the silly parts because ""exercise"" for many of the obese is a dirty word with bad previous experiences associated with it.  One of the reasons why I can my workouts with Jodi ""sessions."" On good days when I can get myself to do the session with ""more vigor"" I sweat and really feel it.  On the not-so-good days I am not able to put in a lot of ""vigor"" so I don't really sweat but I know I have moved more than I normally would have, burned some sort of calorie and got muscles warm and feel it some.

I like that she continues to encourage you to move within your comfort -- that switching levels within a routine is okay - as long as you are able to do it comfortably.  Sometimes I am level 1 other times I am level 2.  I think it will be a long while before I am like her and a level 3 ;-)",1369612800,5,1577,4.061290322580645

I have many, many exercise dvds and this one is quite different, fun and, yes, challenging! If you think that you can't get a good aerobic workout sitting in a chair then I challenge you to try this one. You will think differently afterwards! Also, one of the bonus features that is throughout the dvd that is MISSING from all of the newer exercise dvds and which I personally think is ESSENTIAL is that the instructor pauses between exercise segments for you to take your pulse. This was ""standard"" in the older dvds of years past (okay that ages me) and I feel it is important for anyone to know 1) how they are doing in terms of getting maximum benefit from the exercises 2) that they aren't overworking themselves as well.  I would definitely recommend it because of Ms. Stolove's upbeat and fun attitude (she has legs that go on forever) as well as the solid aerobic benefits you get from doing this.",1367539200,10,1202,4.616822429906542

551171,2,6303075940,"First, let me say that I am handicapped and in a wheelchair. I was hoping that this DVD would give me a good upper body workout with some fun music.

The music is okay, but most of these exercises for the upper body are simply the same arm movements with your fingers pointing or with your hands clapping and waving. There was no effort to focus on anything particular muscle groups of the arms, chest or abdomen; but there are plenty of shoulder rotations and stretching.

Half way through most of these routines, I was bored with the lack of arm work and began doing other movements with my arms, just to keep active. There were long periods of just slapping your knees, clapping your hands or hitting paper plates together.

I cannot do any of the footwork, but it was obvious that the footwork was also repetitious. How many knee bounces or toe taps make for a good work out?

As for the trainer, Jodi speaks rapidly, when giving her initial instructions...as though everyone should know what she is about to do. She seems to have rehearsed her people on the video for the routines, she doesn't give her audience much preparation. I felt like was always one step behind her throughout all of the activities.

I will give this DVD away; and I cancelled my other order for one of Jodi's DVDs, because this one was so disappointing.",1358208000,18,1333,4.5375

551291,4,6303075940,"I take care of an elderly lady and she had Jodi's ""Chair Dancing Around the World."" We did it together and it was a great workout. I, subsequently ordered Jodi's yoga DVD and several others for the simple reason that, while I am able-bodied and have many regular exercise videos, I find it impossible to do them in my small space. With a regular exercise video you are making constant adjustments in terms of moving forward, back, to one side or the other, trying not to kick into the furniture or the walls. It is such a relief not to have to do that and to just exercise.
In terms of this yoga DVD, I mostly liked it. The moves were wonderful adaptations of yoga poses and really did give you a chance to stretch everything out. I wished that she would take more time and go slower with each pose, however, because, like most yoga DVDs, they talk the talk about breathing, but they do not give you any sort of time to inhale and to exhale fully. I have only seen one yoga DVD that gives you time to really breathe and that is Wai Lana's wonderful DVDs but even then, I take the time to breathe only because I don't keep up with her reps, which she does a lot of.
I did not care for the buzzing of the music on this DVD, but it wasn't hugely annoying. Other than that, I love Jodi's clear instructions and the adaptations of the poses. A few more reps of everything would have made it better, but it's good and doable, and you feel good after you do it.",1345248000,6,1454,4.196428571428571

551293,4,6303075940,"I'm dealing with a broken ankle - I'm not casted, just in an air/walking boot, so I can't jostle my foot too much.  After a couple of weeks of inactivity I couldn't stand it and went to Amazon to see what my options were.  Jodi Stolove's ""Chair Dancing"" was about $10 cheaper than other chair exercise alternatives, so I've started here.  She is super-cutesy and the music is pretty bad in places, but I grit my teeth and bear it, because the exercise routine is actually pretty effective and it gets my heart rate up!

The others in the video are of all ages and athletic ranges - male and female, from young teenage girls to elderly couples, from thin and athletic to fairly heavy.

The legs are involved quite a bit, so I would echo what another reviewer said - if you don't have use of your lower limbs, this DVD may not be for you.  You could do the upper limb part, of course, but that's half of what Jodi has to offer - she's serious about the ""dancing"" part, incorporating cha-cha and such into her routines.  I was able to use my left leg while keeping my right leg still so as not to jostle my healing ankle, and my left leg got quite a workout.  Using just the upper body, you would certainly work those muscle groups -- but again, Jodi is serious about the ""dancing"" part.  (Though ""serious"" is the wrong word for this DVD, ""dorky"" being a more accurate term - one star docked for dorkiness.)",1341878400,4,1404,4.32824427480916
551294,4,6303075940,This dvd adapts traditional yoga poses to the seated position - so you can get the benefits of each position without struggling for balance or risking injury.

551297,4,6303075940,"I have always been an avid exerciser:  competitive swimming until my late 40s, step aerobics for 20+ years, and Zumba for the past 3 years.  I was desperate, therefore, when I broke my 5th metatarsal bone (completely in two) 7 weeks ago and was told by my podiatrist that I'll be in a wheelchair for at least 16 weeks!  I ordered several dvd workouts, all claiming to have aerobic benefits, but did find any of them worth repeating until I found this one.  While it does not get my heart rate up to where it needs to be for aerobic conditioning, it still gets me moving and does so safely and with a lot of fun.  Yes, the music is terrible (electronic, poorly arranged, and Muzak-like), and some of the people in the video look really out of it.  BUt the movements are very good and they actually DO correspond to movements one would do in the various dances represented.  I have to modify the movements with my broken leg side in order to prevent pressure on that foot, but this is easily done even with the huge air cast that I have to wear.

I also like the use of paper plates for part of the workout.  I also have a broken right hand (in a hard cast), and I can hold the paper plates easily.  They are great substitutes for clapping my hands together!

The workout is silly, corny, and the set is really dated, but I am VERY grateful for this DVD and will use it every day for the next several months!",1309219200,32,1406,4.2481203007518795

Last year, after a serious automobile accident due to a careless driver, I had to have my ankle rebuilt.  A year later, I had to have the metal removed due to infection.  I still have to wear a brace so I decided to look around for an excerice routine that could be done in a chair and ran across this DVD.  I ordered it and have been using it ever since.  Jodi does everything right in this video.  Checking your pulse is done at the proper intervals and the chart of where you should be at that time is displayed.  She does an excellent warm up and stretch.  Muscles should be properly stretched when the muscles are warm and she does that.  Her toning exercises work all the muscles.  I was surprised at how well the abdominals are worked throughout this video (even more so than most standing aerobics during the cardivascular section).  You will sweat and feel the burn.  The routines are fun.  The people working out with her are in color coded outfits.  When you watch the video you will see that the colors represent various intensities performed by the groups.  Working out with her are some young children, physically fit, middle aged, senoir citizens, and some with weight problems.  The cool down and stretch stretches all those muscles you just worked out.

Recently, I purchased another video to use in my second home where I have been recovering from a knee injury which has prevented the long walks I have relied upon to help keep the weight off and stay fit.

551466,5,6303075940,"After trying a few seated video programs from the library, I found that Kaiser Hospital sold this video. We bought it as a VCR and mom loved it immediately. Actually, we wore out two vcrs of it before I saw it was available on DVD.
Jodi has a cheery demeanor, with peppy music, and ""you can do it"" delivery. A few lame jokes spice up the action. Mom can do the whole video. She has exercise at her senior program, so we add this dvd into the weekend. Mom is 87.",1203984000,9,461,4.076923076923077

I also like Jodi's Sit Down & Tone Up where you use weights.  It's helpful arm and back work.",1200960000,19,366,3.9863013698630136

551469,5,6303075940,Jodi has discovered how to bring the beauty and relaxation of Yoga to folks who are unable to do regular Yoga. Just because these exercises are done sitting on a chair doesn't mean that they are less than the real thing! I love the way I feel while concentrating on the routines and how I feel for the rest of the day. I wholeheartedly recommend the Chair Yoga as well as all of Jodi's other programs! Her caring for the physically-challenged is awesome and inspiring.,1117843200,29,468,4.517647058823529

Don't kid yourself and think these are easy exercises--you get a very real heart-thumping, pulse-pounding work-out that leaves you feeling high on those endorphins. No matter what shape you are in, you CAN DO aerobics with Jodi! No longer an excuse to keep from exercising with Jodi's chair dancing!",1117843200,37,468,5.424657534246576

7836367,2,6303075940,"I had high hopes for this and was so disappointed once I tried it.  After becoming disabled, I keep gaining weight due to not being able to move like I used to, let alone exercise.  I've tried lots of different things and always made me hurt, so after reading this one hoped it would be different.  It was actually worse than most.  It didn't make me hurt, except for normal unused muscle soreness, but it was SOOOOOO BORING!
I made myself try it three times because I have to exercise and figured I'd just get used to it.  But, I just can't.  Here's why:

*  BORING MUSIC - How am I supposed to exercise to elevator music, I ask you?  Would anyone want to?  NO! So slow and sounds like it's being played by either an according or an old organ.  So bad!
*  The people exercising with her are just distracting!  They're supposed to show different levels of the same moves, I suppose, but the older woman (over 60?) was more energetic than the young woman (30?).  And the pregnant lady was doing them like she was from the 1950's when they still believed you shouldn't move too much / too hard or you'd hurt yourself or the baby!
*  Jodi Stolove's talking the entire time - counting - was so loud and so annoying.  I don't really know what was worse - the music or the talking.  But put them together and you have bad, bad, BAD!!

Really, if you want something that is fun, will get you moving because of the beat to the music and the instructor motivates you - this is not it.",1518480000,3,1475,4.244604316546763
