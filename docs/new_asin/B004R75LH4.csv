8438740,2,B004R75LH4,"This ""film"" has some great footage but no narration of any kind and would have benefited from more direction. I had no understanding or clue about what I was looking at or why. It could have easily been saved with some narrative, storyline, topics, chapters, really anything that would help pull it together.",1401321600,,308,4.830188679245283

This will change your perceptions of the art gallery world completely -- so much goes on there in so many different fields of endeavor, I ached to work at the Louvre after I finished watching this DVD.",1380153600,4,358,4.966666666666667
