Has a great old time gospel feel with that big city touch, as common people praise the Lord. Percy's testimony and influence make this DVD worthwhile.",1426118400,,177,4.933333333333334
8212897,5,B000UCH6TG,I have had the CD for years & it continues to be one of my favorites.  I later obtained the DVD as a companion piece as I like to put a face with the voice of the soloist.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  The lighting & sound is perfect.  The continuity of the songs make this a great CD.  It is upbeat & lively & worshipful.  I love to sing along to most every song.,1377820800,,373,3.779220779220779
