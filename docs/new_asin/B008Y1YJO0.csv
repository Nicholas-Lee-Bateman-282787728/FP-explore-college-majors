8532310,4,B008Y1YJO0,A man panics when he realizes he's loosing what he loves most - his daughter or rather his control over his daughter's carefully Daddy planned life.  More poignant than funny.  This is the second film where Ann Francis plays Webb's daughter.  The other is the unfairly forgotten film Dreamboat which is excellent.,1482796800,,313,4.980769230769231

8532314,3,B008Y1YJO0,"This movie was ok, I 'm sorry I bought it, but since my family really enjoys Clifton Webb movies we thought it would be good.  We were disappointed  not many laughs and the story line gets boring after the first hour.",1407456000,2,217,4.2682926829268295
8532315,4,B008Y1YJO0,"As usual, Clifton Webb steals the movie with his looks and remarks. It is a very enjoyable comedy, a good print and a very capable cast. If you're a Webb fan, then add this to your collection.",1378425600,2,192,4.216216216216216
8532316,5,B008Y1YJO0,"Much like in the movie ""Dreamboat,"" we find Clifton Webb and Anne Francis teamed as father and daughter, and the daughter shock her father by having something resembling human emotions. Here we find that daughter is not perfect in dealing with the novelty of human emotions, and this creates some rather interesting developments. The parents add to this mayhem by reacting like we would expect parents to do, and we wonder where the adults got off to.

I ordered it immediately. I love it. I was very happy that I didn't have to wait too long to receive it. Look forward to watching it
