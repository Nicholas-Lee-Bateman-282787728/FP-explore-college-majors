2472226,5,B000CRR3NI,"This is truly a long-awaited season since among fans it is often rated as the best of the best of the series. Season three is very fresh and evolving and holds pretty well next to Season Two that was a very hard act to follow.  In this season we get classic episodes like ""Atomic Shakespeare"", ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" as well as the  hilarious ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"".

Imagine that the first time that Moonlighting aired in Greece; many episodes were not presented in the original order.  For example the episode ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"" was picked as the opener for Season Three for obvious reasons.  Even though on later reruns, other TV channels did justice on the order of the episodes.  I mean no matter how good may be an episode you just do not shift its order from three to one.  This DVD package will be a real pleasure for all collector's who wish to have the proper air date order of that television show.

More over, this is the season that includes the five episode story that starts from ""Blonde on Blonde"" and leads to the season finale ""To Heiress Human"".

That was really the time that Moonlighting reached its peak as far as ratings are concerned.  Still, I believe that the American viewers must felt the ABC channel spoiled all the effect of surprise in respect to the episode that led to the consummation of the duo.  Reading about the whole thing in sites dedicated to the series, ABC Channel tried to capitalize commercially on the anticipation of the fans (by attracting sponsors) and further plugging the premiere of a long forgotten ""Max Headroom"". That must have been sad for all the fans in America because the viewers in Greece enjoyed the natural course and the surprise event between the two main characters.  That had to do with the fact that the series was on public television with no commercial interruptions so no destructive to the surprise element marketing ingeniuty took place.

Personally, as I remember being on a trip in Spain right after the two first Moonlighting seasons had ended in Greece, I had seen on CNN a recurring news event concerning the profanity and the love scene between Maddie and David.  I will never forget that the CNN commentary was hammering the show and for the explicit dialogue and scenes.  By viewing that CNN news commentary I got the impression that Moonlighting had done something really extravagant and pushed the envelope really far.  Flashing forward a year later when the ""I am Curious...Maddie"" first aired in Greece no thunder from the censors came by, only the genuine surprise among the viewers that Maddie and David got finally in bed together.  It was television magic.

All these memories are now offered in this package through classic and ground-breaking episodes. I hope that no alterations took place for Season Three from Lions Gate.  Still, I hope for a special package that will include all five seasons, no episode alterations, all the 15 - 30 second teasers, hopefully the ABC special TV ads for the show, all the deleted scenes and out-takes.  I am a dedicated fan of Moonlighting and hope for better yet releases of the show.",1135123200,12,3131,4.74169741697417
2472227,5,B000CRR3NI,"Well, after some time finally the 15 episodes from season 3 arrive on DVD... and this is a definitely must for all fans. What this a good season? One of the best. Definitely. In fact, take a look just at the guest appareances, which should make the DVD set worth looking to everyone, Moonlighting fan or not: Paul Sorvino (Law & Order), Alley Mills (The Wonder Years), The Temptations, Don King, John Kassir (Tales From The Crypt), Brad Dourif (Deadwood), Sandahl Bergman, Colm Meaney (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Lionel Stander (as ""Max"", Hart To Hart), Cheryl Tiegs, Rona Barrett (The Today Show, Entertainment Tonight), Peter Bogdanovich, Pierce Brosnan (as ""Remington Steele"", Remington Steele), Donna Dixon (Bosom Buddies), Robert Wuhl (Arli$$), Mark Harmon (Flamingo Road, St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope, NCIS), and Gary Cole (Midnight Caller, American Gothic, Crusade).

About the extras (since there are not included in Amazon's description), this is what the back of the box says:

- Memories of Moonlighting"" is a half-hour documentary about the third season, featuring exclusive interviews with cast and crew, including new cast member Curtis Armstrong, and the long-awaited reunion of Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis! Memories of Moonlighting goes behind the scenes to look at some of the amazing stories of the people involved with the show in this extraordinary award-winning season.

- Select Episode Commentaries with Moonlighting creator Glenn Gordon Caron, Cybill Shepherd, Bruce Willis and many more!

2472228,5,B000CRR3NI,"The growing romance between Cybill and Bruce Willis along with the addition of the hilarious Mr. Viola made season 3 the highest peak of this show. Unfortunately, once the first two ended up together, Moonlighting had no place to go in season 4 where the absence of one or both of the main stars on certain episodes became the rule rather than the exception.

At any rate, enjoy season 3. TV rarely gets better than this.",1134432000,10,421,4.5394736842105265

A couple of my faves are the Christmas one were the families of the technicians  get involved, the one where Miss DiPesto finds the baby on Christmas Eve, and, of course, The Taming of the Shrew...wonderful!

2472239,5,B000CRR3NI,"The first three seasons (Which I own thanks to Amazon) are the best ever of any series if you like parody and comic banter. This was Bruce Willis at his charming and handsome best. The premise is a down and out private detective agency (Bruce runs it) and a famous beauty known for her Blur Moon soap (?) commercials. Her agent/manager has just absconded with all her money and she is being forced to find him to get her money back, hence the detective agency need. The series revolves from there and the parodies are masterpieces. My favorite is KISS ME KATE (or Shakespeare's: Taming Of The Shrew) and it is a perfect casting for all. Then they do a Play It Misty For Me and The Postman Always Rings Twice...There are more but these were exceptional. Bruce and Cybil Shepherd were both at the prime of their looks and talent and I was heartbroken that they broke up a great scriptwriting team and a wonderful vehicle for their talents.",1407715200,2,937,4.517647058823529

But ... the series was never any better when they created Big Man on Mulberry Street and Atomic Shakespeare.

This is brilliant TV.

Big Man on Mulberry Street is a tour de force of dancing. And Atomic Shakespeare is a scream, especially if you love Shakespeare.

Indeed, it is among my favourite Shakespearean adaptations, including McKellen's Richard III, Polanski's Macbeth, Fiennes' Coriolanus and, more comically, all of Slings and Arrows.",1400284800,,543,5.206896551724138

Go past the episodes listed on the disk, to the ""menu"" prompt below them. To the right of the ""menu"" prompt is a "">"". Click on the "">"" and a new page will appear with the missing episodes listed. Voila! Problem solved... albeit clumsily. The disks are simply produced differently - some disks have all four thumbnails showing on the first screen, some disks have only two thumbnails showing of the first screen, with the viewer having to figure out how to access the remaining episodes of those disks. Good luck!  The sound is a bit icky - but this is more probably due to initial production, as the voices are sometimes in competition with the background noise and some characters ""slur-eth thy words"", but basically my students will be able to catch most of it and will enjoy the brief diversion from work!",1343865600,3,1147,4.622549019607843

2472258,4,B000CRR3NI,"I love this series but, I'm extremely disappointed to find that 4 of the 15 episodes in ""the complete third season of Moonlighting"" (from the back of the package) are missing. Those episodes include: 7. Atomic Shakespeare (my favorite episode of all) 8. It's a Wonderful Life 11. Blonde On Blonde 12. Sam and Dave . I bought the supposed complete series in a bundle package after reading Amazon's description of the dvd set and nowhere did they mention there were missing episodes. I see now that there are a few other reviewers mentioning the missing episodes prior to my purchasing the set so, I find fault with Amazon for not mentioning it in their product description, and with the despicable maker of this incomplete dvd set. I should have read the reviews before I bought the set but, no one had to sell me on the series. I loved it when it originally aired. I was happy to purchase the whole series when I saw it was available and, I loved watching it again until, I discovered this fraud.
December 2, 2011
Ooops!...I found the missing episodes! Yesterday, I wrote about my disappointment at discovering that 4 of the episodes from the third season of Moonlighting, including my favorite, ""Atomic Shakespeare"", were not on discs 2 and 3 of the set I purchased. I was mistaken and I apologize for my error in reporting that. All the first and second season discs and disc one of the third season showed thumbnail photos and episode titles when I clicked on ""episode selection"". Each of those discs had typically four episodes per disc. When I clicked on episode selection on disc 2 and 3 of season three, each disc only displayed 2 episodes. When I moved down in selecting between the 2 episodes, ""menu"" was the only remaining option available to me, or so I thought, and I was returned to the main menu. Last night, I put in disc 3 to watch its 2 episodes and I noticed the arrow symbol (>) next to ""menu"", and it didn't become highlighted when I clicked ""OK"" on ""menu"". I went back to ""menu"" and then used the right arrow button on my dvd player remote and the arrow (>) symbol became highlighted and brought me to a new screen containing the two missing episodes. The same was the case for disc 2. The missing episodes were there, only hidden. Eureka!!! Boy, am I happy but, boy, do I feel dumb. I guess I've shown everyone that I'm not a Tekkie. Sorry about that! I would also like to change my rating of this set from 2 stars to 4 stars because the series is really wonderful.",1322697600,3,2487,4.4801762114537445

2472261,4,B000CRR3NI,"We all love Moonlighting or else we wouldn't have bought the DVD and commented here, n'est pas? This review is not for content which others have covered thoroughly. (Personally, Big Man on Mulberry Street & Atomic Shakespeare are the best of the entire series run in my humble opinion.)  This review covers the way the discs were made.  There are two options from the menu:  ""Play All"" or ""Episode List.""  If you select 'Episode List' on any disc except the first one, only two or three shows will appear. (These shows usually have cast or director commentary.) However, if you 'Play All,' then all 4 shows that are actually on the disc will play.  For example, another reviewer complained that Atomic Shakespeare ('The Taming of the Shrew' episode) did not appear on the discs.  At first, I had the same experience. On Disc 2, you will only see the first 2 episodes named in the ""Episode List,"" neither of which is Atomic Shakespeare.  However, if you ""Play All,"" and scroll through the first two episodes on the disc, then Atomic Shakespeare comes after those and the Christmas episode (with Maddie as Scrooge)comes after that.  This is true for all discs except 1. If you choose from the Episode List, not all episodes on the disc are listed; you must 'Play All' to watch the third and fourth episodes. This has been my experience on a BluRay player.  Be advised. But the show stands up to the test of time and brought back fabulous memories from my senior year of college when my dorm floor would gather each week to tune in and watch what would happen next.  They don't make 'em like this anymore. Sigh...Great show.  In general, Season 2 is the best but those two shows from Season 3 (Mulberry Street & Shakespeare) make Season 3 a must-have.",1296604800,4,1748,4.624595469255663

First, I purchased the set that contained Seasons 1 through 3. When I got to Season 3, I discovered several episodes were missing. Frustrated but not deterred, I thought perhaps when they consolidated the first three seasons, they cut some shows out, so I ordered this selection of Season 3 by itself. Those four episodes were still missing. Arrrgggghhhh.... And two of them are ones I especially wanted to see. Here they are:

Season three had more unique episodes.  All the episodes due to the writers strike.  Rona Barrett, the introduction of the Hubert (Bert) Viola character.

The episode Atomic Shakespeare a great idea, I always enjoyed it.  In the commentary we learn it was the lowest rated episode.  NOT good after the work & idea put into it.

Then, the introduction & removal of the Sam character with Mark Harmon.  The set up for the last 2 episodes of the season I Am Curious...Maddie the episode where Maddie & David finally get together & To Heiress Human the day after episode.

Cameos from future celebrities, look for those as the show goes on.

OK, let's get technical.  The chases & stunts.  NOT a good job with the stunt people looking like the characters.  But, you remembered the chases because the were funny.

We did NOT really care about the case for the week, we cared about the characters.  How the characters were written & how the behaved is what brought we fans to the show week after week.

My only complaint is that on this DVD set, there seem to be episodes missing.  There are audience reviews built into the show - prior to credits in a few episodes - as giving the viewers a re-cap of the show.  Several of the interviewees speak about a show that is not actually included in the DVD set - we are shown only clips of the ""previous week"" and those were important clips about Mattie and David's relationship.

2472278,3,B000CRR3NI,"Here we are in January 2010 and the problems with the physical flaws in Discs 2 and 3 that some mentioned in passing (not the title flaw, which really wasn't a flaw, just bad menu design) still render two of the three key episodes in Season 3 unplayable.  The key episode ""Blonde on Blonde"" is ENTIRELY unwatchable - the disk completely freezes starting at 1:21 and from then through the entire episode it will simply freeze and at times you can hear the disk crunching in the DVD player trying to track.  The one which follows, whose name I forget now, is almost as bad with the same problem.

I'm upset because reading old reviews, it looks as if this is a known problem, yet Amazon is still shipping defective disks.  I got the entire Moonlighting 5-season set as a Christmas gift and have been really upset that just when I am getting to the part that I loved most about this series, the 4 episode arc that culminates in ""I am Curious....Maddie"", the DVDs suffer from manufacturing defects bad enough to make them unplayable.

Even worse, we sent the disk back to Amazon when the problem was first discovered.  To its credit, the company promptly sent us a new one.  However, the NEW ONE HAS THE EXACT SAME DEFECT, in the same episodes and in the same places within the episodes.  This is shoddy DVD workmanship, and obviously Amazon needs to send their entire stock back to whoever manufactured it rather than keep shipping defective disks.

I give it a 3 only because the episodes which are watchable are so extraordinary that I cannot call the set completely worthless -- even if emotionally it quite upsets me that I cannot watch my favorites.

The manufacturer must have gotten a clue by the 5th season to keep the package straight forward and safe for the disks. The packaging for Seasons 1-4 are bare cardboard covers with glued plastic pages that fall out as soon as the shrink wrap is removed.

2472287,4,B000CRR3NI,"Although writers committed the ""cardinal television sin"" of having their two main characters consummate their long-held sexual tension, the third season of MOONLIGHTING features many of the show's best-ever episodes (""Atomic Shakespeare"", ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"", ""The Straight Poop"" and ""I Am Curious...Maddie"").

This was in my opinion the very height of MOONLIGHTING magic.  Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd really knew their characters by this point, and their scenes together crackle with romantic tension and zinzy comedy.  Allyce Beasley's role of kooky receptionist Miss DiPesto was expanded; and the introduction of Curtis Armstrong as Herb gave the character of DiPesto her very own love interest.

COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:

""The Son Also Rises"" - Paul Sorvino guest stars as David's estranged father, who plans on remarrying.  But a secret from the past could turn his son into the world's worst best man.

""Atomic Shakespeare"" - They're murdering the classics!  Maddie and David take on Shakespeare (and each other) in an outrageous spoof of ""The Taming of the Shrew"".  Colm Meaney makes a guest appearance.

2472290,5,B000CRR3NI,"Season 3 of Moonlighting arguably contains the best episode of the best season of the best TV show from the 1980s.

All the sexual tension that Moonlighting rode on was on display in The Atomic Shakespeare episode.  Considering the real life tension between the stars, the episode practically wrote itself.  The wit of Moonlighting combined with the greatest writer of the English language make it the best 50 minutes of TV ever broadcast.

But Atomic Shakespeare is only the best of the best.  It's a Wonderful Job is my favorite take of the many parodies of the classic Capra movie.  Big Man on Mulberry Street contains a dazzling dance/dream sequence directed by the great Stanley Donen.  Throw in the usual strong Moonlighting episodes (see Cybill Shepherd with her feet sticking out of a mail cart in  Yours Very Deadly) and you have a must have DVD.

The last two seasons were not as strong for a variety of reasons but you can't go wrong with season 3.  Atomic Shakespeare alone is worth the cost.

  Those new to Moonlighting need to know that this is the year the series took a real sharp turn. The egos of the stars were clashing, and always in the news. It was reported each star was refusing to show up for filming, wouldn't act together, and other tantrums. Clearly, story lines had to be written and rewritten to detour around the feud. It is Season 3 that Herb Viola is introduced as a love interest for Miss Depesto. They soon garner a greater and greater presence in the show. At times, the 2 stars are relegated essentially to doing cameos. I believe this was a cheap tactic intended only to hide the fact that the stars were appearing less and less. Personally, I did not tune in to see Herb and Agnes.  It was also during this season that Maddie appeared to ""pick up"" Sam(Mark Harmon) and sleep with him. I thought this very much out of Maddie's character. Soon after, when Cybill became pregnant- her pregnancy was written into the show for Maddie.

  While some found these substantial changes merely continuing a storyline, I thought them too contrived, and it appeared to me that instead of writing for the spirit and mood of the characters so popular in Season 1 and 2, these storylines strayed too far from the original to accommodate the stars' ego, merely to keep pumping out episodes of the show.  Purists and collectors will want all seasons of course, but for those who purchase this merely to watch and enjoy, I recommend buying only seasons 1-3.",1168560000,12,1725,4.6480263157894735

2472308,5,B000CRR3NI,"This is such a great show that revisiting it is painful.  Why?  Because of how the creator and the stars fought and how the show ended.  It's like mourning all over again.  You end up wallowing in the show and then trying to figure out how everything fell apart so badly.  I think this show would have been better on a schedule such as HBO uses for its shows now.  Expecting 23 episodes of Moonlighting was not realistic and the creative juices could have flowed more smoothly and sustained the show.

That being said, there is no question that the Moonlighting season 3 was some of the greatest television ever made.  Maddie Hayes and David Addison are two characters who continue to deserve attention and admiration almost twenty years after their demise.

 Maddie is a beautiful woman who has made a fortune based on looks and now has to rely on her brains for the first time.  David is an immature coworker trying to grow up and impress his boss.  Both characters may fail in the end, but the struggle is ever so interesting.

I highly recommend this show for anyone who loves quality television.

One reviewer complains about flaws on two of the disks, I found them too, but all I had to do was open up the DVD, send the disk back in, select the scene again and there wasn't a problem.  It happens once on disk two and once on disk three.  The show played and I didn't miss a line.

2472309,5,B000CRR3NI,"After having watched and re-watched my Moonlighting Seasons 1 & 2 DVDs, I definitely agree with Bruce Willis' remark that Moonlighting truly is one of the best television shows of all time. Both Cybill Shepherd and he make great use of the chance to demonstrate their brilliance, authenticity and versatility and are very much in sync.

The newly released Season 3 exceeds all expectations, because the Blue Moon agency handles some pretty surprising cases AND it has even more comedy, drama and romance. For slapstick comedy at its best, I suggest  ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"", for the thrilling dream / dance sequence ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"", for costumes, rhymes and a hilarious Taming Of The Shrew ""Atomic Shakespeare"" and for the crackling chemistry between Cybill and Bruce ""I Am Curious.. Maddie"" and ""To Heiress Human"".

This chemistry really makes the show and no other actors have yet come close to generate the attraction these two have. ""Atomic Shakespeare"" director Will Mackenzie points out that ""when David and Maddie banter, it is a sort of verbal sex, .."". I think that Season 3 is the best season of all television history and a ""must have"" for any Moonlighting or Cybill Shepherd or Bruce Willis fan!

As a special treat, Cybill, Bruce, Curtis Armstrong, Allyce Beasly and Mark Harmon as well as writers and crew members share their ""Memories of Moonlighting"" in commentaries and exclusive interviews on the DVDs. They are very entertaining and educational and even some of the fans who participated in the Moonlighting DVD campaign are included.

During the ""Atomic Shakespeare"" commentary, Cybill and Bruce talk at the same time and still manage to hear and respond to what the other says. Sometimes, it is hard to tell where Maddie and David end, and Cybill and Bruce begin.

Above all, the documentary brings the long-awaited reunion of Cybill and Bruce! It is amazing, watching them together again, looking great, chatting, bantering and flirting, their chemistry still very much there. Time doesn't seem to have passed for Moonlighting and its main actors - still as fresh as in the eighties.

The documentary ends with a freeze frame of them hugging, that calls to mind the endings of "" Big Man on Mulberry Street"" and ""I Am Curious.. Maddie"". Maybe hopefully, the reunion of Cybill and Bruce for the Season 3 DVDs is the first step towards a Moonlighting Reunion movie!

At least, the fourth and fifth season should be released on DVD soon, because the 5 years of Moonlighting surpass any other television show I have ever seen. It would be very nice, if some outtakes and deleted scenes could be added as well as more Cybill and Bruce commentaries (without ""chaperone"")!",1147737600,5,2702,4.949227373068433
2472310,5,B000CRR3NI,"I'm a new Moonlighting fan, only have seen it for the first time when the Season One and Two DVDs came out. Season three is my favorite season so far, more comedy, more action and more drama. Season one and two are great, but it just feels like the series came into perfection in season three. This series is a great thing to have in your DVD collection, especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan, which attracted me to this series besides my mom loving it and being a fan since the 80's.

The only problem I had was that the extras weren't that good on this season DVD. It was just about a 30 minute interview with the cast again and then trailers for Wildfire and Weeds. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the extras. It's just that I would have prefered it to have been old TV promos for Moonlighting instead of trailers for TV shows that have nothing to do with the series.

Anyway, I just have to say that this season of Moonlighting (Season 3) was extremely disappointing for me.  I **love** Moonlighting in general and thought the first two seasons were brilliant.  There was a perfect blend of mystery, romance, and zany-ness.

However, in the third season, everything falls flat.  The elements of mystery and plot almost completely disappear, and the characters of David and Maddie descend into a boring, drawn-out, and dysfunctional relationship with each other that resembles a bad soap opera.  The show, for me, becomes quite tedious and unenjoyable in the third season.  For me, the episodes with Mark Harmon are especially boring.

Another thing I really dislike about the third season is the sudden increase in references to the show as a show -- in other words, the characters talking to the audience and talking *about* the show itself.  I hate it when any show does this, since it destroys the suspension of disbelief we as the audience are supposed to have.

It does seem I'm in the minority with these opinions.  Most people seem to love the third season.  However, I will be keeping my DVD of seasons 1 and 2, but getting rid of the third season.  I'm now remembering what I experienced back in the '80's when I watched this show...  I loved it at first, and then stopped watching it in the third season.  I wish I had remembered that before buying the DVD of the third season.  Oh well, you live and you learn.  Needless to say, I will not be buying the next two seasons.

I'm not trying to put down anyone who loves season 3.  I'm just trying to inject another opinion into the mix.  If you're on the fence about season 3, I'd recommend skipping it.",1144800000,14,1815,4.595015576323988

2472326,5,B000CRR3NI,"Actually, I was really surprised that Season 3 of ""Moonlighting"" was as good as it was.  But then all of the stuff at the beginning of episodes talking about viewers waiting around for new episodes was a painful reminder of what it was like during the 1986-87 season where it seemed like every repeat was a step or two backwards for the series.  A full season is supposed to be 22 episodes, and ""Moonlighting"" could only come up with 15, and since one of those was a clip show (""The Straight Poop"") and the one after that the misadventures of Agnes Dipesto and Herbert Viola (""Poltergeist III--- Dipesto Nothing:""), you can knock that number down to an unlike 13.  Again I find myself wishing that at least with regards to ""Moonlighting"" that the show had been a British import, since they are perfectly content to do a full season (""series"" in their brand of English) that could be a dozen episodes or less.

So, even though on the one hand we have those back-to-back episodes treading water while Glen Gordon Caron tried to keep the show afloat, right before that point we had a three episode run of ""Big Man on Mulberry Street,"" ""Atomic Shakespeare,"" and ""It's a Wonderful Job,"" which qualifies as constituting as good as it gets with Dave (Bruce Willis) and Maddie (Cybil Shepherd).  ""Moonlighting"" was nominated for fourteen Emmy Awards that season, and unllike the previous year when it was shut out won for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Willis), and picked up awards for Hairstyling, Costume, and Editing for a Single Camera Production, all for ""Atomic Shakespeare"" (which was the most expensive and lowest rated episode for the show).  The iambic pentameter show had another five nominations, but ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" was up for one (choreography) and ""I am Curious...Maddie"" had two as well (directing and writing).  ""Atomic Shakespeare"" got a lot of the press, but the standout episode is clearly ""Big Man on Mulberry Street,"" which not only has the great dance number to Billy Joel's music, directed by the great Stanley Donner, but the great scene when Dave finds Maddie in his hotel room and she explains why she is there but will not look at him).  The freeze frame at the end ain't bad either, hombres.

Being able to watch these fifteen episodes straight through makes a difference, even when we get to the Sam the Astronaut episodes at the end.  The fact that ""Moonlighting"" was a dramedy is driven home by ""Blonde on Blonde,"" where we have the comedy of Dave following the wrong woman thinking it is Maddie and he is protecting her from having sex with a stranger, and the sobering moment where he goes to her house in the middle of the night to confess that he is in ""like"" with her and Sam  answers the door.  The casting of Mark Harmon as the other man is prefect, because we can both hate him for entering the picture and still admit he would be better for Maddie.  Besides, her anger over the fact he will not say anything legitimately builds the tension to the point where she hauls off and hits him twice, but not three times (cue: ""Be My Baby"").  It might be all down hill from here, and ""To Heiress Humor"" certainly has too much slapstick for my taste, but the moment of absolute wish fulfillment still hits home.

The other surprise is that some of the cases that Blue Moon Investigations handles during Season Three are pretty interesting.  There is the dead wife who calls her husband (""The Man Who Cried Wife""), the woman who wanted to end the exchange of torrid love letters (""Yours, Very Deadly""), and the priest who becomes infatuated with a woman he has heard in confession (""All Creatures Great and ... Not So Great"").  Plus you can throw in Dave's father's wedding (""The Son Also Rises"").  There are really only those two throw away episodes (the clips are great, but we have all of these episodes on DVD, right?), and only ""Symphony in Knocked Flat"" really goes over the top, so even if the season finale is the beginning of the end, we are still into double figures for great and above average episodes.  Now take into account that there are only 15 of them to begin with and that number looks pretty impressive.

The DVD extras include a ""Memories of Moonlighting"" featurette where Caron, Willis and Shepherd sit down and reminisce (the writer does most of the talking, surprise, surprise), and a commentary track for ""The Straight Poop"" where they brought in a quartet of women who had labored on the Internet to have ""Moonlighting"" come out on DVD.  This was a real treat and when more of these cult classic television series come out on DVD other producers should considering doing the same.  After all, the people who buy television shows that are two decades long are clear die hard (rim shot) fans, and ordinary people who can name an episode two seconds into a clip look pretty good against writers, directors, and actors who are always willing to admit they have not seen the episode they are commenting on since it was first made (but Caron and Harmon are above average despite such limitations in their commentary track).",1141689600,13,5091,4.664804469273743
2472327,5,B000CRR3NI,Season Three of Moonlighting was the zenith of the show's five season run.

There is also an episode that is an homage to It's A Wonderful Life where Maddy sees what the her life and the lives of the employees of the Blue Moon Agency would have been like if she did sell the business like she had intended.  Mr. Willis is the real star of this season.  He explodes off the screen and it is easy to see how he made the transition to the big screen.

2472332,5,B000CRR3NI,"What more can I say!  Taming of the Shrew is the best episode of Moonlighting and if memory serves -- the main reason why Moonlighting fell behind in production -- remember all of those repeats during the season??

Definitely a good way to get youngsters to open up to Shakespeare -- and have a good laugh in the process.

Have fun with it.. Watch the Burton/Taylor version then this one!  Which do you prefer and why?  Please write a 500 word essay and post here.... LOL",1138665600,7,471,4.430232558139535
2472333,5,B000CRR3NI,"""Moonlighting"" is my all time favorite television show and I'm very happy that it's finally being released on DVD. The legal issues involved in rights to all the songs Bruce Willis sings made it a long, arduous journey to DVD, but well worth the wait. The show has an interesting trajectory...as it began as a mid-season replacement, so season 1 was a half season. It ran for 5 seasons, with season 3 being the best one. Once David and Maddie slept together, it went downhill as the personal conflicts between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd got more intense.

This season has ""Atomic Shakespeare"", which was one of the coolest episodes I ever saw any tv show attempt. Shakespeare is generally not a joy to read in high school English class (the appreciation and enjoyment of Shakespeare's works seems to come later in life)...but this show made Shakespeare cool for me as one episode used ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and Elizabethan costumes. The ending is classic as both David and Maddie yell into the camera: ""I hate iambic pentameter!"" Or something like that (my memory will be refreshed as soon as I get this collection into my hands and relive it all).

With this release, I hope seasons 4 and 5 are not too far behind in being released. Although the show slopes in its final two seasons, I still think as a whole, the 5 years it aired remains leaps and bounds over any other tv show I've ever seen. The antics of David Addison, with his cool boss demeanor and penchant for breaking into song (something I was happy to see Bruce Willis bring to the big screen in his otherwise dismal ""Hudson Hawk"" film in 1991), matched with Maddie Hayes all-too-serious business lady made for some captivating television. This is one of few shows in which I plan to own every season on DVD (""The West Wing"" being the other). Even when it was bad, it was good. David Addison might even agree.",1138406400,31,1882,4.598214285714286
2472334,5,B000CRR3NI,"What else can you say about Moonlighting Season 3 except that it was the best season out of the 5 seasons for the show. I think it's the best season in all of tv history. This season had everything you could ask for especially more drama and romance. There is the brilliant Taming Of The Shrew episode, the awesome dance/dream sequence in Big Man On Mulberry Street , to the 4 parter costarring Mark Harmon that finally brings Maddie and David together in the episode I Am Curious Maddie which is my favorite episode of the whole 5 years of the show. This is a must for any Moonlighting fan or Bruce Willis / Cybill Shepherd fan to have in their collection.",1136764800,45,657,4.39344262295082
2472335,5,B000CRR3NI,"""Moonlighting"" is one of my favorite shows of all time and I am thrilled that Season 3 will be released less than a year after Seasons 1&2.

As fun and funny as Seasons 1&2 were, Season 3 episodes were truly phenomenal, especially ""Big Man On Mulberry Street"" featuring the incredibly sexy musical/dance dream sequence directed by Stanley Donen, ""Atomic Shakespeare"", the brilliant parody of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and ""Blonde on Blonde"", the episode that was the catalyst to David and Maddie finally ""doing it"" (""I Am Curious...Maddie"").

The great thing about ""Moonlighting"" was that you didn't know what to expect each week (when there was an original episode ;))but it tackled all genres successfully and you were certainly talking about it the next day with your friends and co-workers.

Another wonderful event that we will all witness is the reunion of Bruce and Cybill on the DVD extra ""Memories of Moonlighting"". The reunion is something ""Moonlighting"" fans were waiting for and one that we campaigned tirelessly on Moonlighting21.com and Moonlighting Strangers for the last 4 years.

Let's hope there will be a ""Moonlighting"" movie starring Bruce and Cybill next.",1135900800,15,1176,5.141361256544503
