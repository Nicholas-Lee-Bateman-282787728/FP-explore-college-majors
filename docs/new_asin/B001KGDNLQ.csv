[This is no hype or joke.]

My experience with watching Jamaican movies has most always been positive: SHOTTAS, DANCEHALL QUEEN, COUNTRYMAN, and THE HARDER THEY FALL were all excellent movies. Not only because they were well-produced, but also because they have English subtitles---and thus, you can follow the dialogue---even if you can't always understand the Jamaican patois (pat-twah.) However, the movie BASHMENT GRANNY, not only had no subtitles, it was a badly produced copy of an on-stage play, and had bad audio as well. It was almost incomprehensible to me---as a non-Jamaican.

Normally, I would have just kept this movie and never watched it again.  But, as I do like most Jamaican movies, I decided to return it (at my own expense) after contacting the the seller by e-mail @[Jamanzie-Amazon Marketplace] and he promised a refund. (As such, I was inclined to purchase something else from him at a later time.)  However, after having returned the movie, I never received the refund. And for $13.00 bucks will make no big deal of it.  But be aware of this particular seller...JAMANZIE. For myself, I will purchase nothing in the future from this seller...but you can decide for yourself.",1314748800,,1453,5.139830508474576
8314998,5,B001KGDNLQ,This movie is soooo funny. It is a must see if you haven't seen it yet. You will be on the floor laughing. You will walk out repeating the lines because of the great humor.,1309305600,,172,3.942857142857143
8314999,3,B001KGDNLQ,This movie has humor and laughter but do to the dialect you have to listen closely.  Some parts of the play you kind of know what's being said.  I purchased so many plays and movies that you just kind of know.  Play good for laughter.,1258329600,,234,4.155555555555556
8315000,5,B001KGDNLQ,I can't stop watching this DvD. Shebada had me cracking up.  It's a must see if you love comedy.,1235001600,,96,4.052631578947368
8315001,5,B001KGDNLQ,"This is a very funny play. I love it. It will make you laugh. Make sure you watch it with someone who haven't watched it before. There are some well known lines and they are bound to say them.
They also have Bashment Granny 2 coming out so look out for that. I don't know when, but I just came back from Jamaica and they were advertising it.",1232582400,,341,4.029411764705882
