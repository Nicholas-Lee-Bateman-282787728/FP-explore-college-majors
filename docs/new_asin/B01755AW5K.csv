8738077,4,B01755AW5K,"This was a German-Italian super production film made in 1968-69 by director Robert Siodmark, who was born in the US, but raised in Germany. The film was originally entitled to as Kampf Um Rom. Alternative English titles of this film include Fight for Rome, and The Last Roman.

This film is a bit dated for todays standards, yet the film is also unique and valuable for being one of the few available ever in addressing the historic events depicted in it. In particular, it focuses on the events that took place upon the death of Theodoric in 526, king of Ostrogoths who ruled Italy after deposition of the last west Roman emperor in 476. Several forces collide here. On the one hand, we see an internal dispute among the Ostrogoths themselves to name a successor monarch and keep their ruling over Italy. To that, we add the wish of traditional Patrician Romans who aim to reborn the west Roman Empire, these lead by Cethegus (played by Lawrence Harvey). The third side in this triangle of power includes the Byzantines, ruled by eastern Roman Emperor Justinian (played by the great Orson Welles) and his wife Theodora (played by Italian actress Sylva Koscina). As you might guess, all these forces collide in an arena of political intrigue, personal agendas, and war.

The film stands up as quite good with fine epic battles on exterior settings, including a siege on a walled city of Rome. The pace is good enough to keep you interested. The film is split in two parts: Kampf Um Rom, Teil I (running for about 95 minutes), and Kampf Um Rom, Teil II (running for about 69 minutes), so the entire film runs for about 164 minutes.

Technically, this Spanish produced DVD is a PAL, region free release. I could not identify the Producer behind this DVD release. The image quality behind this digital transfer has that of a VHS only, so hopefully we will get a better transfer in the future. Very important, the audio in this release comes in Castellan and German. Subtitles include Castellan and Portuguese. No extras are provided. Overall, this release seems the only available for Spanish or Portuguese speaking viewers.

I bought this Spanish release from Amazon.es. However, those who speak or understand Italian, may get the Italian DVD release by Sinister Films (Amazon.it). Such release includes the same two part film of this Spanish made release, plus a 78 minute compendium version. The audio language comes in German and Italian. Interestingly, the part II of the film runs for 78 minutes, that is, about 10 minutes longer than the Spanish version.",1486425600,,2558,4.82004555808656
