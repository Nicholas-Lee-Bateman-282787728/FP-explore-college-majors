7863231,5,6304096631,"This video is really good for beginners. You can use it even if you know absolutely no Tai Chi at all. It is very simple. It only teaches you ten movements, so maybe after you master this tape you can move on to one with the 24 forms or something more complex. The video includes some basic posture instructions, then stretching exercises, then the ten movements, all slow so you can follow from the first time. I had a bit of a hard time telling left from right, because they show the movements primarily from a front view. However they do show the movements also from the back and from both sides. Some movements I could do the first time and some I have to practice more, but nothing hard. It is very relaxing and you won't get stressed trying to get the movements right. I am very lazy when it comes to working out but this was a pleasure and my body felt very relaxed.",1266969600,,873,4.265060240963855

7863233,5,6304096631,"having never done any tai chi (but other workouts such as kickboxing, step...) i was very anxious to discover this new kind of peaceful workout. This tape is absolutely great.

I felt very good after doing it even for the first time. Good stretching and incredible inner peace.",1093824000,12,277,4.770833333333333
7863234,5,6304096631,This is a great video for anyone new to tai chi. Multiple angles are used to take into account that you are doing the movements from home. The instruction is clear and there's a great warmup segment that describes the correct way to do the exercises. I would recommend it to anyone.,1045699200,44,282,4.4423076923076925
