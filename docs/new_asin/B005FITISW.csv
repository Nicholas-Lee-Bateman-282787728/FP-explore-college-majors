4676795,4,B005FITISW,"In The Mill and the Cross Polish director Lech Majeski takes the viewer into Pieter Breughel the Elder's 'The Way to Calvary', a painting which depicts Christ's path to his crucifixion in 15th Century Holland, a country then suffering under the yoke of war with Spain.

In the painting, as Breughel explains to his patron, the city of God and the tree of life appear on the left, the city of death and the tree of death, an execution wheel, on the right.  Between the trees of life and death a windmill is perched high upon a mountain from where God gazes down upon his creation.  In the centre, beneath his father's gaze, Christ falls on his path while, as ever in Breughel, everything turns away quite leisurely from the disaster, the crowd staring, instead, at Simon Peter being collared by soldiers to help the convicted carry his cross.

The film recreates the everyday lives, joys and sufferings of the Middle Ages, the simple commerce of the townspeople, love making in the morning, a soldier horribly executed on the wheel, the aforementioned tree of death, and a woman buried alive for an unspecified offence.

Majeski uses other images from Breughel for his tapestry, a scene recalls 'The Hunters in the Snow' and towards the end, with Christ crucified, the villagers dance, in a scene reminiscent of Breughel's wedding dance paintings.

At the film's close the camera pulls back from the painting into the modern art gallery where it hangs.  The viewer sees the distant age he has been privileged to relive recede and emerges, once again, blinking, back into the modern day but with a deeper understanding of Breughel's art and his world.

4676796,5,B005FITISW,"This is the reason that I love film...or at least film as an art form. Words simply cannot do justice to this multi-faceted, thought-provoking, brilliantly colored movie. It belongs to that extremely rare sub-genre of films where the director literally lets us walk inside an oil painting where the figures become ""tableaux vivants"".  Two other such films are ""The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting"" or ""Rembrant's J'Accuse.""  But of the three, this is the most profound - and undoubtedly the most beautiful.  I rank it among the 10 most gorgeous color movies I have ever seen.  Should you rent or buy it...definitely select Blu-Ray because ""that"" will make a difference.

There are no less than four major threads to the movie.  First, it is a portrait of a time and place - the Renaissance world of Pieter Bruegel in Flanders during the 16th century...a Europe of oppression, Spanish rule, and Catholic aggression toward heretics.  Second, it is a story about the thought processes behind the strokes of paint, as narrated by the artist himself. Third it is a representation of the Passion of the Christ - a brilliant re-interpretation by Pieter Bruegel for his largest oil canvas  ""The Procession to Calvary"".  Last but not least, it is an exploration of our interior and exterior lives.

Obviously, in Medieval or Renaissance art, there are many artistic representations of the Passion of the Christ. But what makes this one so unusual is that Jesus is literally at the center of the picture but he is barely noticeable.  There he is, collapsing, trying to lift up the cross and get to Golgotha; Christ has stumbled.  Jesus is not any larger than most of the other characters in the frame of this giant oil painting. There are hundreds of other figures in the painting - in every walk of life - from love-making to picking pockets.

But why is Jesus so small, so barely noticeable?  I believe the artist is telling us that the Christ figure is inside all of us...but that we just don't bother to notice ""him"".  Most of us are too busy with other activities...making a living, trying to impress a pretty girl, taking care of children, and on and on. Every aspect of life is depicted in this film because every aspect of life is depicted in the painting.  [Undoubtedly, the artist had to paint such a large canvas to embrace every variation of human activity]

Then again this is a profound narrative of the Passion Experience, as understood by Christians in the 1500's. In the painting, God as flesh has come to earth to live among us; his death and sacrifice should not be mourned but understood as the great redeeming event for mankind. (This is made clear by the ending of the film). And...God the Father - as the engine of the world - is also there.  In the film he works on top of a mountain in a giant mill. There GOD grinds our daily bread.  Brilliant!

In the earliest biography of Pieter Bruegel, the author [Karel van Mander] suggests that the painter was a profound independent thinker possessing possibly subversive opinions about religion.  He states ""One sees many unusual inventions of symbolic subjects of his witty work in print, but he had still many more, neatly and carefully drawn with some captions on them, some of which he got his wife to burn when he was on his deathbed because he was sorry or that he was afraid that on their account she would get into trouble or she might have to answer for them.""  But one thing is certain in this movie...Breugel was appalled at the persecution of heretics.

When the director does let us walk inside the painting, he does not downplay the violence - neither of the callous torture of heretics nor of the agony of Christ himself. True, this is not gratuitous violence but it is nevertheless highly graphic and very disturbing.  This is NOT an appropriate film for young children.

Through the use of beautiful photography, gorgeous fabrics, and CGI graphics, the film is absolutely glorious to behold. In every way, Bruegel's painting is recreated in such fantastic detail that indeed I imagine myself living inside of it. Roger Ebert said of the movie - and I agree - ""Any description would be an injustice. It is a film before which words fall silent.""

There is not much dialogue in the film...it is meant as a contemplative experience. But for those who wish to engage with the religious message or for those who merely treasure eye-dropping cinematography, this work should NEVER be missed.",1318723200,52,4462,4.7474093264248705
4676797,5,B005FITISW,"Just saw this film at the Tivoli. Never heard of it and chose it spur-of-the-moment. The best film of its kind I've seen since The Tree of Life. Mill is based on a famous painting by Pieter Bruegel called ""Way to Calvary,"" which depicts the Crucifixion.

The great Rutger Hauer plays Bruegel, Michael York his patron, and York's wife, Charlotte Rampling, Bruegel's reference for Mary, Jesus' mother.

This film seems much longer than its 90 min. running time due to a protracted opening where we are presented with a series of scenes that seem random, mostly scenes of everyday rustic life: a man and his wife eating breakfast in a mill, men chopping down a tree, a man and his wife having a picnic and eating bread, a woman breastfeeding her child, a spider web. This goes on for around 45 mins. and in this time there is almost no dialogue, just lingering images that look like museum paintings. This is the only thing that saves the movie's first hour, it's beauty, because there aren't 2 scenes that fit together logically. Like 2001 or the first Alien feature, this slow pace allows the viewer to appreciate the art of the film. It's truly a wonder.

Finally, the dialogue comes in with a scene showing Bruegel sitting and all of the disparate scenes together on a canvas. He then provides the context in which to see these various scenes and magically all of the previous scenes makes sense.

From this point, the film plays out to its inevitable outcome. A very good film. Not mainstream. Aside from a couple of very brief torture scenes, there's absolutely no action to speak of. This is an art film and the number of heads in the theater attested to this. But if you're looking for a good way to spend 90 mins of your life I can think of no better expenditure of time.",1318636800,76,1777,4.54375

4676855,5,B005FITISW,"There are very few films that deal with the Age of the Baroque, especially focusing on an artist. So just the subject matter of Brueghel and the creation of one his masterpieces is unexpected but welcome. However, it is the artistry of the director/producer Lech Majewski that raises this film to greatness. I saw it once by means of a rental, but my viewing circumstances did not do justice to the special qualities of the film. I ordered it knowing I not only wanted to watch it but to study it, which means repeated viewings. I have owned it for three days and watched/studied it three times, each time with greater appreciation and understanding. Rutger Hauer is simply awesome in the way he embodies the role of the painter: I was convinced he was a painter by the way he held his portfolio and made subtle changes to his preliminary sketches. He plays a man who lives for and in his art. When the Spanish soldiers are nearby, he seems to disappear. Obviously, he has no faith in politics. Michael York plays his aristocratic patron who witnesses the Imperial cruelty with helpless shock. His soliloquy quietly delivered in his wife's presence is heart-breaking, a decent man reduced to political impotence. At a crucial moment everything freezes until the miller, a stand-in for God, restarts things. I am still puzzling over that moment and my fourth viewing will focus on it. I look forward also to Brueghel's spider epiphany! Charlotte Rampling as the model for Mother Mary is the beating heart of the story, ""whispering words of wisdom"" indeed",1384041600,3,1553,4.798507462686567

4676942,5,B005FITISW,"Funny thing about real art (or Art, if you will): when you're in its presence, you become exalted. Your mind is transported and your spirit soars and you become one with the artist in a way only you can. Lech Majewksi clearly has that experience with Breughel's art, and he transferred his awe to me as I watched this film.

One can't help but be deeply affected by this film. The attention to detail in all artistic matters is stunning and the faith the writer/director puts in you the viewer is almost frightening. One can not sit and blithely observe The Mill & The Cross. It demands rapt and uneasy attention with its intense slowness while practically forcing you to think deeply about Breughel's period, country, religion, intellect, artistry, politics and above all his humanity and empathy.

Totally without words for the first 32 minutes and with very few thereafter, TM&TC makes us listen to natural sounds we rarely notice, and also observe the silence that country life can provide. It shows simple folk and their culture being torn apart by evil in the guise of good. One can not help but think how many across the planet at this very moment, over 500 years later, are still in Breughel's predicament, confronted with the atrocities and hypocrisy of organized religion yet unable to speak up due to the threat of death, or worse, death of loved ones.

How far have we really come in our ""civilization""?

This is but one of many thoughts one is made to entertain by Majewski's almost torturous glacial pace. TM&TC is perhaps more painting than film, as is apropos. A film about a painting that enters the painting is a gorgeous idea and it plays out with true masterfulness here, from the perfect costumes and sets to the excellent green screen work that blends the artistic media so well. No doubt about one fact: Majewski is a visual genius.

That said, this may be waaay too slow and plotless for those used to speedy Hollywood narratives. It may make some viewers very uncomfortable; where are the words, what's the story, where are my three acts and love interest and action scenes? We are not used to this level of near static vision. We must adapt...another message this film keeps making us consider.

But for those willing to invest 90 minutes of their mind's time into being immersed in another world entirely, this film will take you places no film ever has. If you are willing--and able--to relax all expectations and roll with it.

And be warned: the casual and methodical violence which takes place in such a banal way was to me far more disturbing than any modern cinematic violence, precisely because it is both so painfully realistic and so horrifyingly believable. Even if there's almost no blood, it may seem gorier than any slasher film. It certainly disturbed me, and less visually than conceptually. For there's little element of cinematic drama in it: the horror is in the casual reality of it, and knowing it happened often, to millions, over centuries. All for not accepting a ""message of peace and love and compassion"". Irony more than abounds in history and art, does it not?

If you don't know Breughel's work, especially The Procession To Calvary, you might want to try something unusual: watch the first ten minutes of the dvd interview with the director before you watch the film. The film is more surprising going in cold, but seeing as there's no story per se to ruin or give away, Lech's comments and obviously extraordinary brain set the stage perfectly to see this film in a much deeper light, if the artist is unfamiliar to you.

The interview is by the way a wonderful one. Wajewski's mind and ideas amaze, and the man even wrote some of the oddly affecting music along with composing the stunning images and having the vision to make such a unique work of art. What a talent.

Rutger Hauer is as always smoldering intensity incarnate, and his trademark quiet cynical amusement and bemusement plays perfectly. York is a little overdone at moments but mostly fine, and Rampling is excellent, bringing the suffering of the images to a tangibly emotional point that the film climbs towards. But stars aside, it's the Polish (and Flemish?) actors I've never seen before who really transported me. They inhabit their roles with unnerving ease at times, and their slow motion dancing provides some of the most memorable images I've seen in years. The terror of their daily lives under occupation contrasts to that dance with terrible solemnity.

Breughel's art showed the horror of the Catholic inquisitors with much subtlety, lest he be the next crucifixion. In that spirit Majewski lays their shared vision out on film, and makes one wonder what Breughel would paint now. He'd have no shortage of modern horrors to choose from.

Things change but religious injustice carries on regardless. Majewski's artistic triumph here is not only conveying a strangely synesthetic sense of the blending of all forms of art, but a realization that the deepest art offers not so much escape as total immersion in the unreal world of our daily lives, seen as the comic tragedies they are.

And if consideration of another's art lifts you into inspiration and exaltation, you will be living the gift of the rapturous moment that is religion in its finest form. In this case, from Breughel to Majewski to you. Please pass it on.",1351987200,3,5357,4.803474484256244
4676943,5,B005FITISW,"The renowned Polish director Lech Majewski, based on ""The way to calvary"" takes advantage to carve in relief a very slow paced film beautifully photographed tinged with a minimalist accent.

The Blu-ray rendering is exquisite, and the story is heavily weighted towards visualization over dialogue. It breathes life into the painted figures who scurry through the painting, each wrapped up in the tests and trials of the day, often oblivious to the great drama unfolding at the very center of their activity. We hear few names, but learn a great deal about the historical setting of a biblical subject set in the time of its painter. The performances of the veteran stars are quietly satisfying.

4676945,5,B005FITISW,"I agree with all the other comments: It is a cinematographic feast.

But there is much more than the great imagery.

I think we are told about a deeper existentialist message, where the classic dogma of Christianity is put under scrutiny.

This movie is about the modern man's deep troubles in adjusting his relation with God.

The Mill is the expression of a deistic view, where God exists (the Miller) but do not intervene in the human's life, other than providing the ""daily bread"", the base of common existence.
The only one who can stop the Mill is the artist, just for a short time needed to capture the visual essence of the Calvary:
The importance of Jesus sacrifice is lost to people, due to mundane distractions; Humans cannot comprehend the importance of the event they experience.

Why is Jesus so important?
It is mentioned that he ""broke apart and rebuilt the cathedral in three days"". But, from the movie, we do not clearly understand that Jesus also resurrects.
The Miller is sad when Jesus dies. Is this because Jesus is his son?

Though people are joyously singing and dancing the next day after his sacrifice.
Is this because of the Cross Redemption or just because the Miller provided the ""daily bread"" of material existence?

As any other piece of Art, the movie is a challenge for the viewer. It offers less answers but raises big questions.
It is that kind of movie which seeing twice is not enough.",1342396800,3,1422,4.686746987951807
4676946,5,B005FITISW,"The Mill and the Cross is Lech Majewski's attempt to show us the thought process of the Flemish Renaissance master Pieter Bruegel the elder as he designed and painted The Way to Calvary.  This film was intended as a museum piece, but it has received so much positive attention that it has been shown to art house audiences and is now available on DVD.

This film is meant to be studied.  One viewing will not be enough to thoroughly understand the artistic vision of director Majewski.  Consider the first viewing a walk through a museum in which you, the viewer, stand before a painting for a minute or two and then walk on to the next painting.  This description is apt because this film looks like a painting, and that is deliberate on the part of Majewski.  Time and again I pressed the pause button and saw that the film now looked like a painting.  A minute later I was ready to move on, just as I would in a museum, knowing that more was to be learned if I had the time and interest to see again this most unusual film.

Those viewers who love the art of painting are almost certain to find this film instructive and even entertaining.  Majewski attempts to take us into the mind and thought process of Pieter Bruegel the elder as he assembled all the images for his large and complex painting about the way of the cross of Jesus Christ. In the decisive moment that Bruegel wishes to illustrate, Jesus has fallen under the weight of the cross in the very center of this large canvas.  In the corner closest to the viewer is Mary, the mother of Jesus, who must watch as her son suffers great indignity and a cruel death.  At the very top of the painting is one of the most striking images both in the painting and in the film, a windmill sitting on top of a tremendous, tall, pointed rock.  The miller who grinds his grain in this fantastic mill is meant to represent God the Father looking down at the suffering of his beloved son.  I mention these three elements of the painting and film, but there are many more individual scenes both in the film and painting which deserve our attention and study.

One note of caution.  Even though I said that this film is meant to be shown in museums, it is not meant for children.  Several violent scenes show us Spanish troops beating to death a peasant man for no apparent reason and then placing his broken body on a wheel hoisted on a long pole for viewing by the public.  Ravens come to feed off the broken body.  Another scene shows us a woman being buried alive, again for reasons unknown to us viewers of this horrific scene.  Lastly, we watch as Christ is crowned with thorns and scourged at the pillar before being forced to take up his cross.  Majewski shows us that cruelty and death were an important part of Bruegel's world, just as they were at the time of the Roman occupation of Jerusalem.

The DVD of this film comes with interviews of the director and actors Rutger Hauer, who takes the role of Bruegel, and Michael York, who plays the part of Bruegel's patron.  Students of the art of painting and film are likely to appreciate the director's thoughts about his creative process as he made this most unusual and visually attractive movie.",1339027200,2,3205,4.442735042735043
4676967,5,B005FITISW,"THE MILL & THE CROSS is about the 16th century Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder and one of his more celebrated paintings THE WAY TO CALVARY. If you're not interested in Art and especially the work of Renaissance painters, then you'll wnat to give this movie a wide berth. If you are interested then you'll be rewarded with one of the most stunningly beautiful films that I have ever seen.

Director Lech Majewski has created a moving tapestry that literally begins with movement within the painting itself. We then see glimpses of peasant life which was the subject of so many Bruegel paintings. The recreation of the style, the colors, and the clothing worn is remarkable. Rutger Hauer stars as Bruegel along with Michael York as his wealthy patron and Charlotte Rampling as the painter's wife who also doubles as the Virgin Mary in the painting.

Some of the images are incredibly brutal, for the people of the Netherlands at that time were often subject to harsh reprisals while the country was under Spanish domination. These images work their way into Bruegel's paintings along with whatever else he observed for he was the visual chronicler of his age, sort of a 16th century newsreel on canvas.

The movie is highly stylized for in addition to copying the look of the paintings, there is very little dialogue. In fact there is no dialogue at all during the first half hour. As the film and the picture continue to progress, there is more interaction between the characters. By the time the end is reached (along with the finished painting), the film seems like a documentary. If you enjoy Art and are attuned to visual stimulation then THE MILL & THE CROSS will be almost impossible to forget.",1338422400,7,1708,4.763513513513513
4676968,5,B005FITISW,"In his brilliant short comment on Pieter Brueghel, the elder, Aldous Huxley states that Brueghel's vision on mankind is still highly topical. His paintings are allegories and show him as `a man profoundly convinced of the reality of evil and of the horrors which this mortal life, not to mention eternity, hold in store for suffering humanity. The world is a horrible place; but in spite of this, or precisely because of this, men and women eat, drink and dance.'

Pieter Brueghel's `Way to Calvary' transcends its theme. It is a profoundly bitter condemnation of the occupation of Flanders by the Spanish Catholic king. The Flemings are crucified or broken on the wheel, while their possessions are confiscated and their families destroyed.

Lech Majewski transformed masterfully Brueghel's masterpiece into an impressive movie. The reconstruction of the idyllic landscapes, of the colorful atmosphere of the 16th century cities, of the epochal clothing and of the cold-blooded reign and the executions by the Spanish mercenaries are simply phenomenal, helped most significantly by a brilliant cast and a fantastic color grading.
Lech Majewski's impressive scenes, ranging from simple serene family joys to compulsive sadistic flogging, speak for themselves, while keen commentators, like Breughel himself, critic harshly the savagery of the representatives of the Catholic king.

A must see.",1335139200,2,1393,5.469767441860465
4676969,4,B005FITISW,"""The Mill and the Cross"" (2011) is directed by Lech Majewski (Glass Lips). The film is a recreation of the Flemish renaissance painting ""The Procession of the Calvary"" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This was the largest known painting by Bruegel, measuring 124cm x 170cm (49""x 67"") and was one of sixteen paintings listed in the inventory of the wealthy Antwerp collector Niclaes Jonghelinck, who is also depicted in the movie.  The film is an exquisite realization of the seamless blending of the natural and Bruegel's painted world. The film has no real plot, but depicts the interconnect elements that appear in the painting with the real life world of the painter and his patron as the artist sets out to recreate the world around him. The world depicted reveals details of the villager's life, the fantastic elements of the mill on the sheer rock outcrop, the carnival like atmosphere of the public executions, and the artist's process of constructing the painting. The movie reads more like a viewer's slow viewing of a painting than a narrative as we are captivated more by the extraordinary details than by the overall human drama.

The blu-ray has a number of special features including a 45 minute documentary about the making of the film. There is also a separate interview with the director as well as a Stills Gallery.",1333843200,3,1329,4.876106194690266
4676970,3,B005FITISW,"During the penitential season of Lent 2012, I decided to fast from watching movies. Mostly. I tended to fudge on it by reading allot about films and planning on what I would watch once Lent was over. Feeling the urge to head outside of the house and see one of the many flicks I had been reading about, I tried to convince my wife to accompany me to see either the critically acclaimed Studio Ghibli,film `The Secret World of Ariety' or the critically panned film `The Lorax', which I still think looks good, despite the negative reviews.  If I did happen to watch a film, I promised myself that I would then write a review about it.

 My overall goal for Lent is to give up being passive, laxidasical and slothful. This means applying myself and using my creative writing talents to create a useful reason for actually watching a film and not letting it be just to amuse myself.  I will share that amusement or lack thereof with others by writing A review that was not fluff and had some substance to it. I do hope that this review is informative and entertaining. When my wife learned I was writing a review instead of a journal entry she concluded it would be boring and didn't want me to read it to her. How's that for someone who is supposed to root for the home team.

Not wanting to go to the cinema for financial reasons, I picked a film I thought would be a perfect Lenten film. `The Mill and the Cross'.  If I'm going to watch films during the time I should be sacrificing, I should watch religious ones. TMatC It is philosophical artsy film about artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1564 painting `The Procession to Calvary'.  It is also based on a book by Michael Francis Gibson called `The Mill and the Crossa'.  The film explores the world in which the painter paints his painting.  It explores the many lives that one sees on the canvas. There is a structure and logic to the painting and there is a structure and logic to the film. It goes inside the painting thus going inside the mind of Bruegel.

It is the type of film that you would have to watch more than once in order to get the depth of what is going on story wise. Although despite its creativity and beautiful cinematography, you might not want to come back for a second viewing.  My wife described it as `calm and confusing'.  You somewhat get to know the characters but never their names or some of the motivations behind their actions.  For her it lacked a center that drew the story together. She also found the dead man strung up on a pole with crows pecking at his eyes to be morbid.  The best moment in the film is when either Bruegel or some other character is explaining the meaning behind the symbolism of the painting or some aspect of the world around the painting.

The Mill and the Cross is overall a creative endeavor with some profound food for thought if you're in the right state of mind and can appreciate philosophical artsy reflective non-conventional cinema. It is worth watching at least once and perhaps more than once for the reasons I just mentioned. Although I'm sticking with the just once.

Some nudity of a mother undressing in the presence of her child and some other scenes of sensuality plus somewhat graphic portrayal of violence make this a strictly cinematic  affair for adults only. I now continue my journey to the cross  of Christ on Good Friday and await the resurrection with him on Easter morning.",1330819200,4,3414,4.487883683360258

This painting is truly a work of art; no matter how many times I see this movie I will always see something different come out in the painting this movie is based on, and the film that bring this painting to life.",1329782400,3,361,4.171428571428572

4676973,3,B005FITISW,"Lech Majewski's beautiful film ""The Mill and the Cross"" offers you a unique experience of stepping into the world of a painting -- and one particular painting: Pieter Brueghel the Elder's ""The Way to Calvary."" (You will see the original at the end of the film.) Unlike ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" Majewski's quiet film is not about the painter himself (though in the film Rutger Hauer appears as the painter, giving us some detailed information about the painting). It is about the universe within the painting that is faithfully re-created for the modern viewers.

You may say ""The Mill and the Cross"" is not just a film. It is more like a series of moving tableaus. Director Lech Majewski's passion for the painting is visibly there, with landscapes and portrayals of people of the 16th century Flanders faithfully re-created. But whether you share his passion for the painting is another matter.

In addition to Rutger Hauer, Michael York appears as Nicolaes Jonghelinck, a merchant and patron of Brueghel, and Charlotte Rampling as Virgin Mary. The film's minimal dialogue reminds us that the real ""star"" of the film is the painting. (In fact, Lech Majewski was greatly impressed with the book ""The Mill and the Cross: Peter Brueghel's `Way to Calvary'"" written by Michael Francis Gibson, on which the film is based.)

I must confess that I couldn't find the idea of going inside the painting's universe as intriguing as the filmmaker does. The concept was interesting initially, but ""The Mill and the Cross"" eventually made me wonder: why not watch the original Brueghel painting and use our imagination?",1329004800,4,1610,4.977695167286245
4676974,5,B005FITISW,"The Mill and the Cross is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. I saw it in a theater, and wondered if the sense of becoming part of a painting would translate well onto a television screen, and it does. What an amazing mix of art and allegory. I may never look at a Brueghel painting quite the same way again.",1327968000,,328,4.140625
4676975,5,B005FITISW,"I was held as if in a hypnotic trance by this unusual, meditative and visually stunning film that literally brings to life the world of Pieter Breugel's potent political and spiritual 16th century masterpiece ""The Way to Calvary.""

Rutger Hauer is Breugel and he is our guide as he witnesses, sketches, ponders and wanders in the landscape that was his home and his canvas.  It is a strange, ethereal and horrifying place where red-cloaked emissaries of ruling Catholic Spain persecute, torture and execute Holland's Protestants and other ""heretics.""  Breugel's genius was in painting a searing condemnation of Spain's rule by creating a contemporary Christ on the way to His own execution.  There was no mistaking the point to those who first saw the painting.

If you see Lech Majewski's singular and brilliant film, you will enter the world and mind of an artist that is long gone yet still persists in his art.  Charlotte Ramplings and Michael York co-star.",1327276800,8,961,5.012578616352202
4676976,5,B005FITISW,"especially a movie to see in a theater or with a good pair of speakers because the audio really complements the visual.  Part of what I liked about it is the way the noises transport you into that world.

8470071,5,B005FITISW,"The Mill and the Cross is a serious social comment which contains elements of it's own period and of all time, especially of the New Testament Biblical. It shuffles those elements enough to refer to the dark side of religion and politics and the sad side of life under those influences. It has the feeling of a Pasolini film and left me in a similar dark mood. It's not light entertainment, but well worth watching maybe more than once.",1464652800,,436,4.531645569620253
