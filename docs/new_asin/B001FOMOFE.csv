8302156,5,B001FOMOFE,"From my handle - you can tell that I love to fish.

I love the interaction between these two.

I typically fish for trout, and this helped me understand that a bass strike and set is different from a trout strike and set.",1454112000,2,221,4.116279069767442

8302160,5,B001FOMOFE,"OK -- they are opinionated. But they present the material in a very enjoyable style; and with years of experience to back up their opinions. I'm a long time bass fisherman. I've only used spinning rods. But I'm anxious to try my luck fly fishing. I found the advice and instruction very useful. If you love fishing, even if you never plan to touch a fly rod, I highly recommend this DVD.",1367884800,3,387,4.388888888888889

8302162,5,B001FOMOFE,I bought this for my husband and he treasures it like the Bible of Fishing. He does reccomend this highly.,1358985600,,106,4.35
8302163,5,B001FOMOFE,"I wish I had purchased this when I first started fly fishing for bass. The video has a lot of great information and some of the flies discused and previewed are great.
 It would have saved me some money if I had seen this first then purchased some flies that they had talked about. Both Lefty and Bob share some really great information that would take a person many years to figure out. I would rate this an A++",1283731200,8,412,4.215189873417722
