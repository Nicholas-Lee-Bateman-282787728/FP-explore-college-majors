2404965,5,B000B7QCHM,"This is my childhood memories right here. Even till this day this series is a timeless classic. I'm a sucker for Time pieces,(stuff that take place in the 30s,40s, etc.) this series is a mixture of both modern and 40s era just like the movie Batman (the 1989 movie) in which I'm also fan of. The first three seasons animation is superb I seen nothing like it back in the early 90s and nothing (America animation) is as beautifully drawn like it since that time. The Theme in which it borrows heavily from the 89 Batman theme but made it it's own of all Batman theme's this is still the best theme to define this character. The forth season is good however I'm not a fan of how they changed up the animation in that one.  When I see the 4th season, one of my main complaints off hand is how lazy the design of the Joker is in the 4th season and Poison Ivy design were disappointing she was much sexier in the original animation. However even with that they make up for it with faster action sequences and they used the same animation style in Superman adventures and Justice League cartoons so it became the norm for the rest of it's continuity. Bottom line If you are a fan of Batman you should own this series but be prepared for a animation face lift when you get to the fourth season.",1464739200,5,1287,4.296296296296297
2404966,4,B000B7QCHM,"As advertised, and boxes are fine. The only thing that gets me is that only volume three had my digital copy code in it.

2404969,5,B000B7QCHM,Im a little biased because Batman is my favorite hero. But Batman the animated series is absolutely the best cartoon i've ever seen. The voice acting and story telling in this series is just amazing. A must have for Batman fans.,1448150400,2,228,4.585365853658536

2404971,5,B000B7QCHM,"So good - one of the best American animated series ever, though probably not THE best, since a couple different animation studios were used, and one of them is noticeably sub-par. Still my favorite incarnation of Bruce Wayne's Batman (I like Batman Beyond more as a series due to more cohesive scripting episode-to-episode, consistent animation quality, and the interpersonal dynamics of the recurring characters).",1445904000,,414,5.484375
2404972,1,B000B7QCHM,DO NOT BUY THIS SET. You can buy them individually on here for half the price . jus saying no reason to spend over a 100 if u can get them individually all four volumes. Comes out to bout 60 for the ones I found.,1444867200,3,212,3.7333333333333334

2404980,5,B000B7QCHM,"This was my favorite cartoon growing up and when revisiting these episodes as an adult, they still hold up as favorite.

The writing is of the highest caliber, the animation is excellent and the only bad thing is that it is not given the BluRay high definition treatment.",1424476800,,271,4.645833333333333
2404981,5,B000B7QCHM,This is a great series and a quality set. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys animated shows and Batman.,1424476800,,105,4.578947368421052
2404982,5,B000B7QCHM,"If you like the series, then obviously you will like this product. I think it's a better value than buying the entire box set. You don't get all of the extras like a book and nicer box but you get what you mainly want... the series. And it is one of the best cartoon series ever created for television. It is based on the Tim Burton film series and it really shows, especially in the first three volumes. Later they completely changed the look of the animation but the stories were still wonderful.",1421884800,,498,4.365591397849462
2404983,5,B000B7QCHM,"Coming in a few years after Tim Burton's revamping of the character, Batman: TOS defined the vigilante for an entire group of kids (of which I was one). It was very cool getting back into the series after so many years removed from it. For the most part, the episodes still hold up. There are a few goofy ones here and there, but you can definitely see why this series is so revered. Dark and haunting, these episodes are a must-own for any fan of the Dark Knight.",1421020800,,464,4.284090909090909

2404985,5,B000B7QCHM,I was a little upset the first box looked a bit weathered since I bought this new. This batman series is hands down the best animated series. With Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as the best voice actors as Batman and Joker they hit the nail on the head and drove it strait threw the house.,1419811200,,287,4.142857142857143
2404986,5,B000B7QCHM,"Batman The Animated Series, the only Batman cartoon that I liked as a kid and still like to this day. All other Batman cartoons, will never be as good as this. I bought the whole collection individually, because if you buy them as a set you will pay a little more then you would individually. Batman always has been my favorite DC and WB superhero.",1419033600,9,348,4.369230769230769

2404988,5,B000B7QCHM,"Oh my, where to start. I loved this show growing up--when broadcast Saturday-morning cartoons were still a thing--and was amazed at how well it has held up. Sometimes its best to leave the past in the past, but this isn't the case with The Animated Series. The art is splendid, the stories dark and the voice acting superb.

I still hear Mark Hamill in my head when I read comics to this day, and you should too.",1414195200,,412,4.35064935064935

2405000,1,B000B7QCHM,"I am not judging the series itself or even the dvds. They are phenomenal and I own every single dvd set. But if you buy the sets individually from Amazon, the total comes out to less than $70! That is HALF the price of this! Do not pay double just to avoid having to click the ""add to cart"" button an additional 3 times. Besides that I fully recommend this series! Just don't get jipped by this listing!",1355443200,89,403,4.17948717948718
2405011,5,B000B7QCHM,"I grew up watching this show and was first in line to buy it when it came out on dvd! I still love it just as much after all this time, the stories and animation still hold up even as an adult. I also can't even begin to explain how happy it makes me that my children love this show just as much as I did as a kid.

 EVERYTHING about this show is exceptional!

The stories are like mini movies, the animation is amazing, and who could hate the show that introduced Harley Quinn? Who could hate anything written by Paul Dini period?

This is, was, and always will be the best Batman show for me.

If you are a fan of Batman at all, you have to own this collection.",1350432000,,663,3.992424242424242

2405014,5,B000B7QCHM,"I bought this set all together from the Amazon website about a year ago. I watched the Batman cartoon as a child and have ALWAYS been a Batman fan so this was a must have for me. Once I got it I ended up watching all the seasons and it was amazing. The boxes are really nice with colored photos of all of the episodes and I just have to say that I had no complaints...this is a MUST for any Batman fan, especially one who grew up in the 90's and watched the cartoon.",1262563200,,466,3.9157894736842107
2405015,5,B000B7QCHM,"I bought this collection as a gift for my daughter. Out of all the animated Batman series we find this to be of the best quality in animation, characters and story lines. It was a favorite of hers and mine as she was growing up and it can never seem to be seen on TV. A lot of other Batman stories of today are a lot ""darker"" and the villians more morbid. This series does Batman as he was meant to be.",1262217600,,402,3.9146341463414633
2405016,5,B000B7QCHM,"One of my favorite shows as a kid! It still blows my mind that I now own the entire series. If you are looking for a quality representation of not only Batman, but animation and story, this is the series to get! Highly recommended!",1256342400,,231,4.2727272727272725

2405018,5,B000B7QCHM,"Many electronics stores, who will remain unmentioned, only carry 3 of the 4 volumes. This is, however, the complete series. It was shipped quickly and directly through amazon.com, so I knew I could buy with confidence. Additionally, with super saver shipping, I paid the as-shown price and didn't have to worry about calculating shipping. They allowed me to track the shipment right to my door, and it was packed securely and properly.

The DVDs arrived safe and sound and work without a hitch. If you like Batman - The Animated Series, and cannot find the complete series, or if you wish to buy with confidence, then I suggest you buy from amazon.com.",1249948800,,652,4.821428571428571
2405019,5,B000B7QCHM,"All Four Season?  Got to love this series, it's basically the origin of the modern animation tradition, from this start they moved and made an new Spider-man, Superman, X-men, etc, etc.  This was the start of a more adult oriented cartoon.  Still with all the goodies for kids but themes adults can really appreciate, I promise.  Overall, this is the best 4 box sets you can get, however, you can get them in one really big set now, so in light of that, I'd go for it.  It's just that that came out after I started collecting.  Eh...what can you do?",1247443200,,549,4.3861386138613865
2405020,5,B000B7QCHM,i love batman a lot and i grew up watching this series on TV it is well made and was great. as a kid i really enjoyed each episode and even now as an adult i still enjoy the show because of the details in the each series. the artwork and animation is great. the voice acting is stellar and the music is movie track worthy. The creators knew what they were doing. they were comic book artist and had never done any cartoons until they made this series and they did it right. [...],1247011200,,479,4.052631578947368

2405034,5,B000B7QCHM,"I cannot express how much I loved this product. I grew up watching this on tv, along with Spiderman and Xmen (which I'm still waiting for the seasons to be released, hurry up Fox!) The entire series is well done, the stories are excellent, although near the end the stories are lacking the substance that they had in the first seasons, but still they were not terrible. The acting was excellent and the cartoon was well drawn. If you are a Batman fan, this is a must have in your dvd collection.",1215216000,,495,4.391304347826087
2405035,5,B000B7QCHM,"Batman the animated series is a definate favourite!
I used to watch it every saturday morning, bowl of coco-pops in hand and thoroughly enjoyed it then.  I enjoy it just as much now.

It features decent plots which are so lacking in present-day kids cartoons.  I also have a renewed appreciation for the animation.  Quality of animation is also a missing element in many cartoons these days.  But Batman the Animated series has been produced to be just like a Noir Comic, which I love!  Beautifully drawn, and perfectly executed.

This is well worth the money!",1214006400,,560,4.770833333333333
2405036,5,B000B7QCHM,"I remember watching the batman animated series every day after I got out of junior high.  It was one of the many shows of the early 90's that a young kid could choose from to enjoy for the evening.  Frankly batman and a lot of other cartoons during the time didn't stoop to a level where it held it's audiences hand and guided it through everything as if it where helpless like today's cartoons do.

These shows where intelligent and engaging.  And after watching 2 of these 4 volumes over the course of the week, I'm reminded of how fortunate we are to have technology that allows us to add such awesome entertainment to our library of video's.",1213833600,,645,4.440677966101695

The fact that it was hand drawn, dark deco, with superb writing as well as animation firmly places it in the category of the greatest cartoon ever created. The box set includes every brodcast episode, as well as a rarely seen pilot episode, behind the scenes featurette, and the complete new adventures of batman which finished out the series. A must buy for any batman fan, and heads and tails above batman and robin and batman forever. Buy this emmy winning cartoon and watch it!",1198540800,13,645,4.568965517241379

2405053,1,B000B7QCHM,"I give this collection 5 stars, please understand that.  I just know that people are more willing to go to a 1 star review.
I'm writing this to tell you that if the price is $140, WAIT.  I bought the collection on Amazon for $83 after it was $140 a week before.  The price for this collection fluctuates for reasons I cannot figure out.
That aside, the entire collection is brilliant save for a few stupid Catwoman and Penguin episodes, but you weren't expecting greatness from those two anyway.
Harley Quinn is the diamond of this series as she is born from this and thrives in this environment.  She's cute, hilarious, and deadly at the same time, and her episodes (actually, any Joker episode besides Last Laugh and Christmas with the Joker) are must sees for any fan of DCAU.
Fantastic collection, but please wait until the price is low (which it always comes back to) before you buy.",1191888000,32,888,4.566037735849057

If you are a Batman fan, this is a must-have collection, in preference to the recent animated series ""The Batman"" which is poor. This series is much closer to the original comic and provides outstanding voice acting and breathtaking artwork and animation. Kevin Conroy will always be the true voice of Batman. Thanks to Amazon for shipping it to Australia so quickly.",1189123200,3,517,4.886363636363637
2405055,5,B000B7QCHM,"I'm sure by now you've got the message. This is DCAU at it's best. This is one of the greatest superhero cartoons ever made right next to it's  predecessors Justice League and JLU. Not that much of a Supes TAS fan. But this is exactly why Batman is the man. Great art. Some don't like the revamped art in the last volume but c'mon get over it. The stories are still great and the action gets amped up even more. Who could complain about that?? Whether you're younger than 15 years old or older than 50, Trust me this is well worth the money. I know, because I have all of them. The first three volumes are amazing 5-star-quality stories that feel like a movie every episode. Seriously. Yeah there are some shaky episodes in Volume one(especially with the Joker)that are passible, but once they get movin' with Catwoman and then Two Face and then Clayface stories, all you can say at the end is WoW!! Then Volume 2 and 3 takes it to the next level if that were possible. In Volume 4 alot gets changed. The characters are more diagonal which is annoying at first but you get used to it once the fists start flyin and the batarangs get's a goin. Talk about ACTION anyone!? So, in essence like my title sais, If you haven't got it...Get it. With the Pre-school, I need a diaper type cartoons passing as quality these days (like ""The Batman"") you'll need to remember what cartoons really used to be.",1179964800,5,1394,4.403100775193798
2405056,5,B000B7QCHM,"I've always liked Batman.  I've never been a comic book reader, but screen versions of the character have been in my life since childhood.  From the fun childhood memories of the campy old TV show (Same Bat Time, Same Bat Channel), to the much more serious Tim Burton movies, to the ok Batman Forever and awful Batman & Robin, and finally the nicely done Batman Begins, Batman has always been a franchise I enjoyed even if it wasn't a favorite.

A recent obsession with all things related to Superman brought me to the DC Animated Universe.  From there I finally decided to get the much praised Batman - The Animated Series.  If only I'd known.  Everything else I ever watched of the Caped Crusader was left behind.  This is without a doubt the best screen version of Batman.

If you like the character of Batman in any way, but have never seen this series, do youreslf a favor and get it.",1178409600,24,889,4.478260869565218
