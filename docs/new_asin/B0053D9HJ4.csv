8455148,4,B0053D9HJ4,"After being impress with the talent of this actress in Forbrydelsen (The Killing), I was curious of some of her other work.  Sekten is all Sfie Grabol with other less known actors (unless one has seen some swedish series like Wallander) were familiar faces also appears in Credo.  Sfie plays a character about to be married in 10 days and has to put up with : absentee groom to be (we never see him anyway), a controlling mother in law to be, trying to save herself and her girlfriend being under control of a psychologist brain washing his followers to become new human beings (ya right!)and the psychologist female devotee turning into her master!!!  Wow quite a story but Sfie is looking good in a real female role as oppose to her criminal investigator role in Forbrydelsen.",1328918400,2,778,4.664233576642336
8455149,4,B0053D9HJ4,"This 1997 Danish thriller will find itself particularly popular among fans of Denmark's Sofie Grbl of the original version of The Killing. Sofie plays Mona who's about to marry Martin who is currently away in Hong Kong. It's Mona's hen party when we meet the characters and Mona has concerns about her best friend Anne who has become involved with a dangerous sect.
This is certainly not my favourite Danish film, but it's far from the worst. Sofie appears in most scenes of the film and displays her usual wide range of acting talents. Well done Sofie!
Swedish Wallander fans will also notice Stina Ekblad appear as well as Lars Brygmann who starred in DR's fantastic Rejseholdet / Unit One.
This particular version of the film has English subtitles, however when English is occasionally spoken there are no subtitles.",1317859200,,819,4.899280575539568
