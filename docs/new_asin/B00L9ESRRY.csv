8664609,5,B00L9ESRRY,"All of the Great Layout Adventures  are good quality programs. The more recent ones, that are available on Blu-Ray have the best visual quality. The production standards are high.  They typically have good interviews, great and interesting footage of the trains in action. Most of the layouts are  high quality detailed settings that would have taken a lot of time and effort to create and most feature a good variety of recent highly detailed locomotives and freight and passenger cars.  Overall, since these are filmed in HD and available on Blu-Ray, they might be the best of their category.",1475020800,,594,4.96969696969697
