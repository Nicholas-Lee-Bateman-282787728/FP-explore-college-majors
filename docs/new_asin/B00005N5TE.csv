1628076,5,B00005N5TE,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Philadelphia Festival of World Cinema. ....
...""Startup.com"" is an amazing documentary following the rise and fall of an Internet startup company. A handful of twentysomething entrepreneurs, armed with an idea, a $200,000 initial investment, and a vision to facilitate government interaction on the Internet, set out to assemble a business from the ground up. From half a dozen partners to hundreds of employees and millions of dollars in investment capital, the young businessmen grow faster than they'd ever dreamed. Soon come CNN appearances and meetings with President Clinton. But before long, we're no longer following the rise of an Internet company... we're following its destruction.
The subject of the film is amazingly engrossing: seeing and feeling the emotions inside a startup business was so fascinating. However, ""Startup.com"" is brilliant for reasons beyond its superb subject matter. Documentary has, to me, come to mean a clunky outsider's perspective. This film, though, dispelled that myth. The story, the testimony, the interactions in ""Startup.com"" really do take you inside the subject matter they set out to explore; this is the work of two master documentarians. Two distinctly different persons are followed as the film subtly depicts friendships and the conflicts of personal and business relationships. This kind of multi-layered narrative and characterization is something I've witnessed before in only the greatest of screenplays. And therein lies what makes ""Startup.com"" so incredible--there was no screenplay, it was real life--5 stars.",991008000,4,1616,5.573170731707317
1628077,4,B00005N5TE,"A few days ago I heard in a radio show how they believe that this movie captured the Internet era. As a recent ""Failed Startup Graduate"", I was very curious to see whether that is true. After viewing it, I must say - VERY VERY true!!!

This movie is not a work of fiction, it is a documetary - everything is actual footage which was taken in more than a year. It tells the story of the founding of GovWorks.com, a startup company which connected its site users with government operations (""Made the government more efficient"", as the founders say). The makers of the film followed the two founders, Tom and Kaleil from day one. The movie starts when Kaleil leaves his old job and becomes CEO of GovWorks.com, and ends more than a year after that. As you probably know, this has been a very ..interesting year, so to speak for the High Tech industry. But the movie isn't just about the company, it also tells the highs and lows that Kaleil and Tom had to go through during these tough and exciting times. I think this is a fascinating movie which really makes the viewer feel as if he is a part of the story, especially since Kaleil and Tom have been so generous in sharing what they've gone through with the viewers.",990835200,9,1216,4.404444444444445
1628078,4,B00005N5TE,"You already know the ending, or should, since we're just now emerging from a ""dot bomb"" economy. Nonetheless, the film is engaging as it tells the story of two entrepreneurs and their quest to start an on-line business, 'Govworks.com'.
The story plays out through scenes shot on handheld video, which lend both intimacy and immediacy to the film. We follow the protagonists from the very start as they are deciding on a company name, through funding and the company's growth and ultimate decline.
Interestingly, while one would assume this is a movie purely about the life of a start-up, Web-based business, it is in actuality a story of friendship. Through the trials and tribulations of the business, we watch the impact on the relationship of these childhood friends.
An interesting film for our times.",990316800,3,805,5.014925373134329
1628079,5,B00005N5TE,"Excellent documentary that shows from the inside what was going on in the Internet .com boom, who was caught up in it, how much money was flowing freely, and how it fell apart, leaving some with nothing more than they started.  The film concentrates on the relationship between high school friends Tom and Kaleil, who in their 20s founded govworks.com and raised more than $20 million in venture capital, and in the process what happened to their friendship.  Even more intimate and personal than the War Room (documentary about the first Clinton campaign by some of the same people).  A rare glimpse into a rare time.  Highly recommended.",990230400,5,639,4.888888888888889
1628093,4,B00005N5TE,"Purchased this DVD when it came out a few years ago and it was great watching it. Most entrepreneurs are so caught up in the business that they're not even thinking about documenting the journey, which is what's so fascinating about this one. These guys actually have a camera on them 24/7 and are capturing what it feels like to be an entrepreneur going out and starting a business. I'm giving it a 4 star because it's been a decade or so since this movie was filmed so things have changed in the startup world and some things may not be as relevant. Still, it's pretty entertaining to watch these guys embark on their journey and the struggles they go through are real.",1402531200,,671,4.463414634146342

1628102,5,B00005N5TE,"Watching this movie brought back memories of just how easy it was to obtain VC funding for just about any fuzzy idea connected to the internet.  We watch as a company ""starts up"" with high hopes for making it big in the dot com era, only to see it slip so needlessly away.

Millions of dollars are wasted, as tempers flare when it all begins to slowly fall apart.  The lasting image i have from this movie is the scene with then president Bill Clinton, as they sidle up to him and try to get the business from Bill.  its an amazing story to see a firm ""almost make it"" The funny part is when you find out who was smart enough to walk away with some money.  My ""Best Advice"" is to find a way to see this movie, either on DVD or Video on Demand, to learn what can happen when blind ambition meets a brick wall.

1628123,5,B00005N5TE,"Seeing the mixed reviews on Amazon made me a little wary before I saw the film but after seeing it, I'm really glad I did.  This movie tells the tale of how the classic startup duo -  the geeky engineer and the smooth talking business guy build a $60 million company in the span of less than 2 years.  It is a monumental achievement by the film-makers who filmed the duo day-in-day out for two years and put together a movie that is as insightful as it is compelling.

For those aspiring entrepreneurs interested in the film, I cannot urge you enough to see it.  From this film you witness firsthand how a top tier VC is pitched ( the founders get money from Kleiner Perkins ), what getting a term sheet is like, and how a twenty-something wet-behind-the-ears entrepreneur leads and motivates a team of over 200 employees.  To top that off you get sucked into the buddy story of the founders that is so masterful, no writer could've come up with something this good.

5 stars, a must see for the aspiring entrepreneur.",1256169600,,1018,4.47027027027027
1628124,4,B00005N5TE,"The Bottom Line:

As with most documentaries which involve candid moments there's always some doubt as to the veracity of the characters' actions, but [...] has so much compelling material about the rise and fall of a quintessential [...] (a not-so-necessary website called govworks that would allow you to pay parking tickets and such online) which burns through millions of venture capital without any real thought to turning a profit that it quickly dispels such concerns; if you're at all interested in that particular bubble of about a decade ago, check out this interesting film.

1628125,5,B00005N5TE,"I just finished watching this movie right off of Amazon's website, one of the dot coms that survived.  Througout the entire movie I can feel the energy, frustration, anxiety, excitement, and all types of other emotions from the characters in the movie.  I kept asking myself, ""did this really happen"".  That's because I did not read the description of the movie until after I watched it.  I'm not sure this movie was motivational or sad.  But the arrangement and flow of the movie is like impeccable.  From the start of the movie to the end, the movie its like a total attention grabber.  There was never a dull moment throughout this entire movie.  I wouldn't mind watching it again.. Very very entertaining.  Even at the end, I was waiting for more.  Also, as someone else stated, I wish they would've covered more of the startup.  The movie starts with the CEO of the new dot-com company quitting his job so that he could work full time for his business. He has a high school buddy who partners with him on this joint venture.  But by this time, they already had a solid idea of what they wanted the business to do, and who they could contact to obtain millions of dollars in fundings.  My thing is, how did they get to that point.  If you are at the point where you are quitting your job, that means your company is more than off the ground, you have some signicant capital so that not only your company stays a float for a while, but you personally can live strictly off the capital of either your company or you have a nice chunk of life savings to hold you over.  Ohh also, at the beginning of the movie, the company already has 8 employees.  They were doing really good..  I'm not even sure how, because they didn't even have a product yet.",1252195200,,1748,4.4125
1628126,4,B00005N5TE,"Just saw this film for the first time on IFC and let me begin by adding to the multiple accolades about this film primarily because it's a great film for business school students of what NOT to do in the world of being an entrepreneur.  I'm very glad to see the failure of these guys and I'm sure they are still paying for it till this day to a certain extent, if not financially, then psychologically and emotionally.

I am a IT tech guy who was a part of the dot com bubble, but knew even back then it was not going to last.  I was trained from the ""old school"" corporate environment (ie. The Big Blue IBM culture, apparently, that was ""uncool"" to the dot-commers) of a SOUND business plan along with a SOLID structure and NOT JUST PURE VISION.  These guys were just over-glorified, ego-centric, slippery salesmen.  They SOLD a dream to which they crashed and burned and THANK GOD FOR IT!

I won't waste my time regurgitating the well-deserved harsh words of what real and successful entrepreneurs have already given them through the years, but my message for Kaleil to which I'm sure he has figured out now is ""less glory"" and ""more humility"".  Dude, successful people are ""behind the scenes"" not seeking glory and making things happen and are the REAL ""Go To"" guys/gals.  It isn't about your RICH image and your Tiffany cufflinks, but rather the BIG debt that only YOU know really exists!

I run a small tech consulting company based on pure personal passion and servitude to others.  Although I am not making millions, I am comfortable AND, I am NOT incurring debt.  I am also not spending much on marketing.  WHY?  Because my humble attitude and kind approach not only strengthens my positive reputation amongst my business peers, but it leads to a return in revenue which ALSO leads to others speaking kindly and the word of mouth spreads like wildfire.

I really wouldn't comment too much on a film, but after seeing these two guys, I needed a place to vent my anger due to the sheer stupidity of these guys.  I am sure they are ""good"" men in general, but they suck in business to put it bluntly and I'm hoping they both wised up after a good decade!",1234915200,3,2158,4.5115681233933165

Why?.....his life WAS his startup and it came crashing down around him and he couldn't bear it.
STARTUP.COM is a timeless look at the rise and fall of businesses and the people who rise and fall with them. Some people who will view this film will only want to know one thing:How do I succeed in building a business and make money? Others will view this film and learn about the trmendous sacrifices to self and interpersonal relationships that  comes from examining the failures of others driven by an intense desire or need to ""succeed"".This documentary examines both aspects of business-the technical and the personal. The two aspects are always competing. The lives of the ""twentysomething""founders of gov.

Loyalties and passions are questioned. This is a very realistic look at the down -and -dirty business world as portrayed in the .com rush of a few years back.

1628143,5,B00005N5TE,"Wonderful stuff!!!

I love reading and viewing anything I can get my hands on about this lovely Valley I call home. I'm fascinated by stories about young people starting .com ventures, both those who made it and those who didn't! We can all learn from each other, and most of them have the cool attitude: If at first we don't succeed, we will try and try again!

Silicon Valley is an exciting place to read about, and it's even more exhilarating to live here. As I wrote in my young adult novel, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY:

""If, as Steven King once wrote, 'Valleys are the dimples on the face of the earth,' then Silicon Valley is undoubtedly the deepest, most sparkling dimple of them all."" - Betty Dravis",1125792000,2,714,4.51937984496124
1628144,5,B00005N5TE,"Wait, that's Casino.

""It'll be the last time, touchy-feely, self-esteem believing psychobabblers were in charge of something that F'n valuable.""

I actually love this movie being a small-scale entrepenuer centered in computers and specifically the internet myself.

We see 2 guys who actually have a great and truly lucrative idea in a new market, making government functions, services and information available over the internet.

We also see a time when investors were quite foolishly optimistic about investing in anything having to do with the internet.

We also have a couple of reasonably bright but not brilliant students raised on self-esteem believing they can conquer the world.

Here we have the fallacy of the psuedo-science psychology and specifically self-esteem which has been doing damage to the U.S productivity in the same proportion as it has been increasing in popular thought.

Our schools have been teaching so much self-esteem nonsense.  If you feel good about yourself, you will achieve more.  Yet if you compare academic achievement, students in countries such as Korea where the students were more likely to not consider themselves bright, considering themselves not to have above average skills in mathmatics scored much higher than students in countries like the U.S. where they indicated great self-confidence in their intelligence.

This is the opposite of when the U.S. students would have been on top in achievement in less-psychologized days.

The documentary starts out with Kaleil(?) and Tom buying out a third founder who is not going forward in quitting his job and dedicating fully to their new business.  This guy plays Kaleil and Tom like marionettes and they buy him out for $700,000(?) before the thing is really even started.

At this point, we see our first glaring indication of what psychologized men they are, Kaleil and Tom comfort each other about how it hurt each other more ""emotionally"" than the money itself.

In the film, Tom is definitely the one who has bought into modern psychological thought the most.  He places importance on creating good feelings, creating company social occasions, and positive work environments.  He even focuses on little company ""camping"" events where his father plays a guitar and has sing-a-long songs.  Meanwhile, Tom isn't that great of a programmer and the documentarians fail to show how he leads a programming team.  However, we do later see, it was not done successfully as GovWorks software was incompentently made and has very obvious problems while nearing production status that shouldn't have gotten past the beginning stages of development.

Kaleil does seem to have a lot of organizational, business skills getting investors interested (although the absurdly unrealistically optimistic internet enthusiasm made it possible where normally he probably couldn't have) and putting together various business deals.  Unfortunately, Kaleil himself does focus on organizing company ""Rah Rah"" sessions as well as motivational-speaker-type events.

Meanwhile Tom and the programmers have developed a horrendously faulty system that Kaleil rightfully declares he can not release into the market despite its emminent deadline.

Then business reality finally starts to take force and Tom is forced out of the company.  Now Tom and Kaleil fight and then hug and nurture each other going through this struggle.

Now, we have a competitor breaking the market with what seems to be a competent product and the end of GovWorks quickens.

There is a lot of things I was interested in about this movie.

#1) Entrepenuerial effort even though failed.
#2) A study on the farce of psychological thought being an asset while in reality being quite destructive.
#3) True dramatic interactions between close friends during different situations and struggles.  Even if they are sappy psychobabblers who made their own problems.

The potential of their plan was incredible and legitimate.  These guys could have made in the hundreds of millions each if they implemented their ideas correctly.  It was a time that won't happen again in the foreseeable future.

#1) A legitimately new and lucrative market waiting to be exploited.
#2) Investors throwing money around at anything ""internet"".

In honesty, with a little LESS confidence, LESS believing in themselves and an extreme dedicated focus on perfecting the product, they probably could have made it.",1123804800,8,4424,5.348265895953757

I think the overall lesson from the bubble is that valuation, profits, and experience matter. This is what the bubble era lacked and this documentary covers it well. These guys had no business running a company, getting funding, and were little concerned with producing a quality product that had longevity. Shame on them for going into business but moreso for those VC's giving them money....so it went.

From my experience, most of these types of people went out of the industry to easier stomping grounds to get their MBA's, have babies, or become accountants. Some have moved onto the new frontier of other start-up areas and have not learned their lesson either.

1628148,4,B00005N5TE,"This movie is basically about one thing: a young, wildly arrogant and immature businessman named Kaleil Izaza Tuzman, and how foolish everyone was for believing in him for even a split second. He is such an amateur, such a pompous fool, that the whole documentary takes on the feel of a practical joke as we watch bankers, co-workers, and at least one woman get sucked into this clown's semi-fabulous dot.com world. There is a certain satisfaction as we watch the movie and watch what was truly a house of cards come tumbling down on this poor ass.

To a somewhat lesser extent, the movie also follows his partner Tom, who is a bit more subtle and reflective than Kaleil, but equally ignorant about what they are actually doing. But in telling Tom's story, the film makes some serious mistakes and omissions. He kind of jumps on the scene and it is hard to understand where he is from both literally and in a broader sense.

Overall the one thing to take away from this movie is just how amazingly stupid people were in the late 1990s. Kaleil and Tom ran one of the most worthless businesses I have ever heard of (although hindsight is perfect after all) and managed to get 50 million dollars and hire 250 people. It's really mind-blowing. It is also surprising and disturbing that Kaleil was hired by Goldman Sachs. The fact that anyone hired this doofus at all, let alone the investment banking department of Goldman Sachs, is disgraceful. I mean, this is a guy who's invited to be on CNN and he shows up wearing gold chains. It is really amazing that nowhere in his journey did anyone just pull him aside and tell him, ""Kaleil, you have got to ditch the french cuffs and for God's sake, slow down when you talk to people, and get a decent haircut and decent clothes. You look like you got pulled off the beach at Atlantic city."" I mean, you want to scream at him throughout the movie. I know this is a superficial criticism, but it is quite apt I think, as his dubious style and demeanor proves to be an accurate reflection of his abilities as a businessman: he's all flash and no substance. In fact, in the end, he seals his own fate as an absolute zero when he forgets to check the code the night before his site goes up! It doesnt take much to realize that the reality of the situation is that for all their audacity, both Kaleil and Tom are actually pretty sloppy, bad and immature communicators, and of questionable intelligence. Really.  In fact, all they really have is ambition.

I guess that is a statement of sorts in itself; arguably, the failure of the insipidly named ""govworks"" illustrates that just maybe substance does count for something after all. This documentary is far from perfect, but worthwhile simply for its portrayal of the spectacular period of fiasco and waste in the 1990s that will probably never happen again, which is probably a good thing.",1105056000,11,2876,4.578640776699029

1628150,4,B00005N5TE,"This is pure documentary, all created by a handheld video camera, filmed in 4:3 format. The only artistic aspect is some nifty editing (e.g. she says to camera that she wants to settle down with Kaleil and get a dog; he says to the telephone, almost immediately afterwards, but in a different venue, that he hates the idea of having either a dog or a baby.) This film is not going to win any prizes for cinematography.

But what you do get is a fantastically instructive series of lessons in how to start up a business. Ultimately these guys fail, but along the way, you get a lot of lessons in what venture capitalists were looking for, how to attract talent and funding when you seem to have nothing but enthusiasm to offer, how to handle competitors and how to cope with long-term friends in your firm.

This is the DVD you need to watch every time you're thinking of starting up a business, or thinking of going into business with a friend. Not necessarily to put you off, but at least to warn you of some of the dangers.

Of course, there is a very different VC climate nowadays, since the dot-com bust, and I would imagine that even then, some of the US practices seen here would not be transferable to the UK without some modification. In this film, it is startling to see a small group of twentysomethings flying between the East Coast and Silicon Valley, casually talking about getting their first $15 million of funding when they have no customers and no product. One of the original founders gets out very early -- it seems for $700K in cash -- and it looks likely, he is the only one who makes anything out of this venture, called govWorks.com. (By the way, the film ends with the caption that the firm was bought by a multinational, but that Web address does not seem to work now. Although bizarrely the fictitious Web address implied by the start.com title DOES exist!)

So, every would-be MBA graduate ought to watch this movie. This exposes the vicious realities -- e.g. that the senior board members you recruited to give your company credibility (e.g. ex-mayors) are also the ones prepared to sack you when the going gets tough. But at least these dot-com CEOs did not have to put their houses at risk -- a common stipulation in the UK.

It's rivetting stuff.

It's what happens when an egotistical moron and his subserviant pushover ""friend"" from high school start a company based on something they know nothing about.  As you watch the movie, it becomes clear that neither of them know anything about computers, programming, or the necessity of a functional product.  Just look at when they're in a meeting and Kaleil is confused by ""things flying across the monitor.""  I'd bet money it's a screensaver.  Just look at how they cut out the solution to the problem there.  What could this huge number of employees POSSIBLY be doing?  A simple database program like this could be made by less than 10 people in a week!!  The most hilarious part in my opinion is that Tom winds up going back to work with Kaleil after it's all over.  How can't he see that he's been used?  A better question is how do the editors of the documentary buy into Kaleil's rhetoric?  When they're doing their commentary in the extras, they don't seem to notice the humor of the situation at all.  I think Dora said it best: they're a bunch of little kids all dressed up playing grownup.  I'd point out other stuff, but there just isn't enough space to glorify every moment.

I gave it two stars because I thought it made a good dark comedy.  These guys are living characatures.
Let's be honest about this: $60M ... 18 months.  That's $3.33M per MONTH.  To go through that kind of money without producing anything of any value takes serious (bad) talent.
The co-founder who bailed early was the only smart one in this travesty.  The rest of it is just ego-stroking and ""poor me"" when things fall apart.
Now they are saying that they don't receive any money from this movie.  That they're using it as a promo piece for their new business.  After seeing THIS ... what idiot would trust these two?",1072224000,10,709,4.535433070866142
1628165,1,B00005N5TE,"This movie caused me to lose 2 hours of my life, and I want them back!  After seeing this movie, it is obvious that the reason for govWorks.com's failure is not due to unfortunate stock market circumstances but because the owners just couldn't get along!  From the start of the film, it is easy to see that the characters starting this company lack the discipline and true customer dedication to make this company a success.  Throughout the movie, Mr. Kaleil tries to impress the viewers with his use of foul language, angry tones, and cell phones.
These two obviously do not have a concrete business plan.  As can be seen in the scenes negotiating with venture capital firms, Mr. Herman deviates from their original 'vision', spontaneously talking about giving people directions to government buildings.  They apparently did not have any focus on why people would pay money for their service.  Their lack of customer interaction sticks out like a sore thumb - nowhere in the development of govWorks.com do the founders actually perform any market research.  They obtain large sums of venture capital, and celebrate without considering what they will use their funds for.  They pile on the millions, but make no reference to their NEEDs in their cash flow statements (if they even had one).
Overall the video is poorly directed - even for a documentary.  There is no narration and the movie is acted out in a series of ""scenes"" taken by a home video.  It is very much like ""reality TV"".  All of the steps in building (and destroying) their company are implicit through dialog, rather than explained.
If you like reality TV or just like watching 2 dimwits trying to start a company, then buy this.  But if you are serious about seeing a motivational story or learning something about starting a company, don't waste your time on this movie.

1628166,2,B00005N5TE,"I was very interested in seeing the decline and fall of a dotcom from the inside.  Unfortunately, that wasn't what the filmakers thought they were filming.  They thought it was going to be an inside look at a buff, young entreprenuer who makes an empire worth billions during the dotcom boom.  They didn't seem to care much about showing how the company operated and what it's plan to make money was.  It's almost as if during filming they viewed the company's success as a guarantee and what they really just wanted to do a personality piece on Kaleil so in the future others could look back at the life of an industrial giant.  In the process, they squandered the opportunity for the real story (which was the fall of the company and why).  That makes watching the documentary very frustrating, to be so close to the real story but miss it all.  (but they manage to capture some stuff suitable for a Kaleil fitness workout video ... how fascinating).
I give it 2 stars because there are a few interesting bits in there.  And the personality of the CEO (or, ""co-CEOs"") is part of the story I wanted to see, but I was looking for something more.  Who were they hiring and why?  How were they choosing to spend the VC money?  What milestones had they set and did they reach any of them?  How were they going to stave off competition?  Maybe they just didn't have executive staff meetings, or maybe the camera wasn't interested/invited.
My poor rating speaks more about the filmakers than the subject matter itself.  As for Kaleil and Tom, I found both of them loathesome and fake, even worse than I expected.  They seemed genuinely clueless about what to do after raising VC money.  Almost as if rasing the money was the real success and the rest would just fall into place after that.  In all honesty, Kaleil seemed to do his job ... raise money and be a face guy.  But who's responsibility was it to make the company work?  We never get to see.
In the end, you will laugh remembering the early co-founder who was ""bought out"" (driven out) for $700,000.  Was this the guy who was going to make it all work?  What skills did they lose when they played their hand against him?  (unfortunately, that is not answered).  The other founders thought they were cutting him out, but as it turns out he got the only parachute.  Ironic.",1057017600,7,2325,4.507177033492823
1628167,4,B00005N5TE,"STARTUP.COM is a fascinating documentry/ cautionary tale centering around Kaleil Tuzman and Tom Herman, two childhood friends who hit upon the bright idea of establishing a company named govworks.com. The film chronicles 18 months in their lives as the pair strive to make their dream a reality; eventually  reaching a level of success uncanny for such a short period, rubbing shoulders with President Clinton (I was disappointed that Bill didn't produce one of his famous cigars and ask Kaleil for a light, all the while wiggling his eyebrows like Groucho Marx) and then ultimately watching it come crashing down around them. Could Tuzman's astronomical ego and jet turbine sized motor-mouth be to blame? Watch this and judge for yourself.
STARTUP.COM is possibly one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, despite the two main protagonists being self- absorbed poindexters gone haywire. Essential viewing for anybody who harbors similar ambitions; this will give you an idea of what NOT to do. It's only Tuzman's arrogance that prevents STARTUP.COM from getting 5 stars; though Herman is equally bad by neglecting his adorable little girl and attractive wife (How is it possible?) in order to become rich and powerful.
Finally, it's interesting to note that throughout the film from shot to shot Herman's face keeps changing: One shot he has a beard, then he's clean shaven, then beard again, then he's trimmed it to a goatee. Directors Jehane Noujaim and Chris Hegedus even go so far as showing a sequence of Herman shaving his beard off. Is this a subtle attempt at demonstrating the ""cut-throat"" world of entrepeneurship? A case of ""hair today, gone tomorrow?"" I'm still scratching my noodle at the complexity of it all.

I mean, out of the gazillions of dot coms with exactly the same story to tell as govworks.com (a couple of moderately-bright and over-ambitious young guys with a lukewarm idea hit up their family and friends up for money, get a round of financing, and fall on their faces as soon as it's clear that the whole thing was rushed into and had a flimsy foundation), it is a shame that this movie followed the travels of the two ... in charge.  Furthermore, this documentary somehow took footage from a spot on the front line of one of the most bombastic, hectic, and electrifying times in this nation's economy, and distilled it into a drab and boring story.  Trust me, this felt every bit like a documentary (you know, the bad kind- the kind which every good documentary clearly distances itself from).
Kaleil Isaza Tuzman was OK but had too big of an ego (he'd make a better cheerleader than businessman, use of corporate buzzwords and catchphrases notwithstanding), Tom Herman was a creep with a wet-blanket liberal  personality, and the prevailing quality that comes to mind for everyone involved in the project is ""spoiled.""  Plus, the movie's editing job is such that it never really conveys that these guys had to work too hard to achieve any measure of success; they should have been thrilled to make it as far as they did, given the flimsiness of their game plan, their lack of preparedness for key interviews and opportunities, and the grave errors still in existence at the time they launched.

1628170,4,B00005N5TE,"An absolutely fascinating document of the rise and fall of an internet company (govworks.com) as the bubble was preparing to burst.
Kaleil Tuzman and his buddy Tom decide to create a web site that would work with governments to do things like handle parking ticket payments, license applications, etc...on-line, for a fee, of course.  The movie begins with the two friends, along with some business partners, brainstorming over what to call the business and then going out to venture capitalists to raise the funds...tens of millions of dollars.  Early on, the ask a ""man on the street"" what he thinks of the name of their web site.  He declares he doesn't like it...doesn't trust the government.  An early potential investor tells them they're three years too late with their idea and that it will fail.  These words turn out to be prophetic...but these guys are mostly amused and laugh the criticism off.
Tuzman is the focal point of the movie.  His is an ego run rampant.  We see him scheming...this is a real, live type-A internet tycoon.  His temper flairs, he's foul-mouthed, he's full of himself.  But he can be convincing and charming too.  Tom, his oldest, dearest friend, is very soft-spoken in comparison, and the two occasionally fight...and occasionally hug in reconciliation.
The raise a bunch of money and really start living high on the hog.  But when things go downhill, Tuzman turns on Tom and the disintegration of the company and relationship is luridly fascinating.  We'd like to turn away, because what we see is real...but we can't.  These guys are getting thier comeuppance...and that's fun to see.  But we've also learned to empathize with them...to hope that THIS TIME the story won't turn out the way you know it will.
The movie is fun.  The filmmakers were SO lucky to get this kind of access at this point in internet history.  A few years earlier and maybe govworks might have made it, and then the story wouldn't have been interesting.  A few months later, and there would have been no funding and thus no story to tell.
Some viewers who aren't very familiar with venture capital and such might get lost at a few points in the film, BUT, you can certainly understand what's going on by the roller-coaster of emotions these guys are going through.  There's no narration to tell you what, factually, is happening...we see it all through the conversations of these guys we're following.  Powerful stuff and worth putting up with the only occasionally esoteric financial details.
It's interesting that we never get a really clear idea of how govworks.com is supposed to work...I suspect these guys didn't really either.  It was a time when just opening up on the web could yield millions.  The business model would take care of itself...so they thought.  So, ultimately, startup.com is a cautionary tale.

1628171,4,B00005N5TE,"""Startup.com"" is a fascinating, but slightly flawed documentary following the lives of several men who founded a dot-com in 1998. (Work leading to its creation had started months earlier, but wasn't included in the documentary.)  The principal dot-com founders were Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Tom Herman and Chieh Cheung.  Kaleil and Tom were high school friends.  Shortly after the company's official launch, Chieh's involvement was terminated after Kaleil and Tom decided to buy him out.  They believed Chieh wasn't doing enough, in spite of Chieh's time, work and money invested prior to the company's official launch.
For the most part, the first third of documentary is devoted to Kaleil's efforts to obtain venture capitalist (VC) investment into the new company.  The combination of his efforts and unbridled VC risk-taking of the 1990's succeeded in Kaleil securing $50-million in VC investment.  At the company's launch, it had eight employees.  After several months of hard work and the hiring of a lot more staff, the company's website was finally launched. Within about a year, the company's total employment exceeded 200 employees, but the joy didn't last long.  Personality conflicts between Kaleil and Tom lead to some unpleasant consequences.  Also, like most of the dot-com's created in the 1990's, the amount of money earned through the company's website paled in comparison to the amount of invested capital and the money squandered by the company.
Sadly, the creators of this documentary (Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim) focused far too much on Kaleil, not enough on Tom and very little on Chieh.  The quality of the documentary would have been far better had more time been devoted to Tom throughout the film, and more to Chieh at the beginning (prior to the company's launch).  No narration was provided in the documentary.  Instead, it was shot much like a reality television show using small hand-held cameras, but occasional subtitles provide the viewer with time references and employee counts.  Highlights in the documentary include an actual CNBC interview with Kaleil (when the company was worth $50-million with venture capital) and his brief meeting with then U.S. President Bill Clinton.
The real value of this documentary is fourfold:
(1) The eagerness of 1990's venture capitalists to willingly invest millions of dollars into companies with unsubstantiated and exaggerated business plans.
(2) The squandering by dot-com's of millions of invested dollars
(3) The strain put on long-term friendships when money and cutthroat business practices get involved.
(4) Seeing some of the faces and narcissistic egos behind dot-coms.
For these reasons, I rate this documentary with 4 out of 5 stars. I highly recommend it to any former or current dot-com employee, to anyone that invested and subsequently lost money in a dot-com or to anyone that wants to form his/her own company.",1046044800,31,2903,5.27114967462039

1628173,3,B00005N5TE,"This documentary is primarily a cinema verite documentation of the personalities behind a start-up-dot-com during the apex of the internet bubble.  In other words, the directors used non-actors, such as the CEO and his co-founders, small hand-held cameras, and actual homes and surroundings as their location for this film to capture the personalities involved.  This includes:  The tantrums, the broken friendships, the narcissism, the venture capital meetings, and the often obscene; (yes, obscene), amounts of money tossed out by venture capitalists to anybody with a website as if they were drunk sailors visiting a two-dollar brothel.
My favorite part was seeing our CEO interviewed on a CNBC-like program stating with a straight face that his company was worth 50 million dollars. Below him at the bottom of the screen was a stock-ticker going off with a myriad of internet ticker symbols rolling by which were all generally trading in the triple digit range such as, SUNW, or Sun Microsystems, trading then at $133.00 a share but now trading in 2002 at $4 a share.
I often got angry watching this documentary primarily because of all the excess.  However I am glad this film was made because it chronicles the personalities behind the history rather than the history itself.  This is something we don't see when we watch a documentary about the 1929 stock market crash, or by reading a dry dissertation of the Dutch tulip-bubble.
If you are looking for just the human story alone and what money can do to friendships and egos, buy this movie.  If you are looking to observe the day-to-day management of a dot.com you will be disappointed.",1038441600,11,1645,5.007326007326007

The opening 3/4 is fine, but it is the last 15 minutes that so disappoints. As the dotcom boom turns to bomb there is virtually no coverage of the monumental NASDAQ collapse and the financial hole that the likes of boo.com, epets, yahoo, aol etc fell/have fallen into. I appreciate that the doco is more about the relationship between Tom and Kaleil, but seeing more information about the actual govworks product, who was using it, why it failed, and how so many others failed, would have added so much to the story. As it is you get the feeling that govworks was alone in its failure. There is little of the additional background story which would have fleshed out the govworks story immeasurably.
This failure to place govworks in the 2000 dotcom crash perspective saves this story from being excellent.
Technically some of the focusing and framing is poor, as you'd expect. Worse tho is the terrible lip-sync which is sometimes wildly out of kilter which adversely affects ones ability to follow the story. A subtitle track would also have helped to follow some of the muffled telephone calls.

1628176,4,B00005N5TE,"This documentary about the rise and fall of govworks.com reveals both the strengths and weaknesses of cinema verite documentaries with no voiceovers.
On the one hand, we get to see the two intelligent cofounders of govworks.com, Kaliel and Tom, up close and personal in a way that the printed word would have difficulty doing justice to.  Watching their strains, their accomplishments, and their hubris is fascinating.
On the other hand, we do not get much of the crucial but less photogenic backstory.  We don't know much about what these guys were doing before they started the company.  We don't see much of their interaction with the venture capitalists who funded them or the board that apparently was near the point of firing them.  We see that there was a suspicious break-in to their offices, but there is no follow-up in the documentary about whether the police ever found the culprit, what the missing documents were, and why the documents were so important.  We see more of their discussions about raising money and less of the conversations about what features they would include on the web site, how they decided on its design, and so forth.  We never are told what the business model for the company was.  How specifically did they expect to make a profit, and what did they fail to anticipate that prevented them from doing so?  (Did they have too few customers?  Could they not get enough cities to participate?)  Perhaps they had no clear path to profitability, but that is something we should know.  Finally, we see Bryan R. Mundy, the CEO of competitor ezgov.com, visiting govwork.com's headquarters, and we later hear Kaleil complain that govwork.com's competitors (including, I assume, ezgov.com) are doing much better.  How did these other companies make a go of it?  What did they do that govworks.com failed to do?  (For those who are curious, ezgov.com is still in business, but Mr. Mundy died in a fire in his house in January 2001.)  These are the sorts of details that a good Wall Street Journal feature or a John McPhee profile would have included.
See the film if you are interested in the personalities and lives of two hi-tech entrepeneurs as they take flight and then crash and burn.  It's like watching an engrossing Greek tragedy.

Although I know that the directors were interested in the human side of the story, I wish they had delved a little more into the technical discussions. It would have lent the whole operation the appearance of competence, if indeed there was any, because there didn't seem to be much. Taking your whole company up to camp for a corny teambuilding weekend can't make up for a lack of technical knowledge. Why didn't they realize their product didn't work until a $2 million testing session revealed it? Was anyone at the top keeping an eye on product development?
Also, I counted exactly one instance where Kaleil mentioned how they were going to make a profit, but he didn't seem to have any problem burning through millions of dollars.

The movie focused too much on the two CEO's of the company, and not the actual company itself.  Kaleil and Tom (especially Kaleil) was focused on by the camera throughout the whole movie, and I got the sense that the whole time it was just Kaleil trying to figure out how to make his money and keep it.  I was more interested in the site govworks.com itself and what was on it.  Kaleil's relationship with his co-workers was focused on greatly.  The good thing about this is that it does a good overview of how people act in the business world, and how life is in the internet universe.  This documentary is more of a biography on Kaleil and Tom, and how their lives played out.  I was looking forward to seeing the bulk and the detail of the company and how it rose and fell.  I was not interested on seeing if Tom could spend time with his daughter all that much.

The movie covers more than a year in the rise and fall of an internet startup, and does so with the assumption that the audience has a short attention span and won't be interested in the details. And so, there were complex interactions in several areas that were central to the story but which were dealt with superficially. First, the dealings between the company and the venture capitalists. A lot of screen time was devoted to the search for money, but I can't say it shed any light, for me, on how they actually got the money. Next, there was the buyout of one of the founders, with negotiations that got pretty ugly. Never did I get what precipitated the buyout or why things got so ugly. Then, there was a pivotal confrontation between the two remaining founders.  I sat staring at the screen wondering, what are the issues here? What is happening to this company?  Do I even care? No, the filmmakers gave me no reason to care about either the company or the people. There were a lot of people treating each other badly while saying to the camera how relationships are the most important thing in their life.
There was no narration, little explanation, quick edits that left with me with more questions and no answers.  There were captions showing the growth of the company. 20 employees. 75 employees. 200 employees. And suddenly, near the end, empty cubicles and a caption that said  50 employees. What caused the sudden dropoff?  Was it the beginning of the bubble bursting for internet stocks?  Or was it that their competitors had, technically,  better websites? I really couldn't tell.  Maybe the point of the movie was merely to entertain, and not to elucidate what happened to one company during the internet mania. But I wasn't even entertained.",1009843200,3,1863,4.675840978593272

The every day running the relationships between them the strugle to survive and make people and investors to believe in them are given with a plain and simple way which on the other hand makes the film fascinating. It could be more specific about the industry and how it really works instead of passing fast this stage and this is a missing point but the whole movie is fast just like the success and the failure in todays world.
I really did have good time watching this movie.

1628188,2,B00005N5TE,"Although it is not a good movie it is a lot of fun to watch the whole artificial thing fail.  Vanity and greed are the orders of the day, culminating in the moment when KIT has his ""best friend from college"" (read: poor trusting sap) fired and escorted out by security.

Calling this a ""documentary"" is only partly true; the crew were friends of the stars and they (KIT & Tom) are rumored to have been paid handsomely for their performance.  So much for artistic integrity.  Right off the bat you'll smell a rat as many of the scenes really feel ""acted"".  Note the scene where KIT coaches his team on how to appear on a Spanish TV broadcast (a gig he apparently got because his girlfriend was on their staff.. or is this why he dated her in the first place?)  People act differently when they know they are on camera... good documentary makers know this and generally overcome this; their subjects appear natural.  Many scenes in ""startup"" have an artificial ""I know I'm on camera... everybody watch what I'm going to do/say now!"" feel.
I enjoy the parallels between the movie and the company.. they are both focused on image over substance and both fail because of it.  The company's product is late to the market and (apparently) not nearly the quality of its competitors.  This movie focuses on KIT instead of the company and ultimately fails due to its lack of substance.  There are many, many better made documentaries.  Save your own Venture Capital and go rent something else.  (=",1007510400,10,1487,4.612167300380228
1628189,2,B00005N5TE,"As far as documentaries go, this one isn't very good.  I was expecting to see a film on the rise and fall of an internet company.  Instead, I got CEO and buddy yell into a phone.  I was very disappointed not to find out about the day-to-day operations of the company, what the 200+ employees did all day while Kaleil was meeting with VC's, or why they waited until the night before the launch to first test their site (sheesh, no wonder the business failed).  Even knowing WHO the employees were would have been nice.  Otherwise, it makes Kaleil and Tom's talk of being a family, not a company, sound hollow.
Even for what it was trying to do, by focusing on the two founders and their relationship, it didn't do very well.  There was so much I didn't know about Tom and Kaleil, no background information was given other than they had known each other since high school.  Where did they go to college?  We find out Kaleil left his investment banking job to work on govworks.com but what did Tom do before?  How did Kaleil come up with the idea of a website to pay parking tickets?  Who were the other founders and what were their roles in the company and relationship with Kaleil and Tom?  Why should we care about these guys?  I quickly found myself not caring about them, their company, or thier dog.
This could have been a good documentary if the directors had been more focused.  So much was left unexplained, I was more confused at the end then enlightened - not a good sign for a documentary.  I give it 2 stars, one for Tom's daughter (very cute little girl) and one for giving me a chance to laugh at two of the fools who ruined our previously healthy economy.",1007337600,17,1668,4.390879478827362
1628190,4,B00005N5TE,"I originally rented Startup.com because of a lack of worthwhile selections at the local Blockbuster.  Also, a guy I grew up with worked at GovWorks from the early days.  My expectations were low.  Most dot com company cultures and techies I've come into contact with are overly quirky and boring- definitely not entertainment value.
I was pleasantly surprised when I viewed the dvd.  The story is enthralling and the content is timely.  The founders, Tom Herman and Kalil Isaza Tuzman, are freinds from childhood with radically different personalities (exacerbated by the editing).  Tom is the uptight techie tinkering in the shadows with remedial social skills.  Kalil is Mr. Charisma with unbounded ambition looking to cinch the big deal and steam roll anybody in his path.
The business is formed and funded.  The founders' personalities clash.  A power struggle ensues.  GovWorks' shaky business model, the internet mania, and the odd freindship between Tom and Kalil all unravel at about the same time.  This outcome is predictable.  What is fascinating and disturbing is watching all the ambition, posturing and hubris foment from inception until the ultimate devistation- shut down day.
This movie is a fine example of the times.  Tom and Kalil are highly talented and intelligent with excellent career tracks.  Inexplicably, they quit their jobs to go for the big score, instant IPO wealth, and ultimately get trashed by the crazy juggernaut they create.",1007078400,,1461,5.214592274678112
1628191,4,B00005N5TE,"This documentary was a voyeuristic look at the rise and fall of the dream of two young men, friends since high school. The two main players, Kaleil, a born salesman, and Tom, the techno person, go from rags to riches to rags again in the frenzied arena of the dot com revolution, with their idea for an e-commerce site that would allow people to pay parking tickets online.
At the beginning, when they started to get financial backing, they were not even sure of what they were going to put online! I was amazed at the financing they were able to obtain, $60 million, based on only an idea, nothing tangible. I guess that is why I am not an enterpreneur!
I liked the format and never felt that Tom and Kaleil were playing to the camera....I think they were so self-absorbed that it just did not matter. Watching their failure, even though the viewer knew in advance that it was going to happen, was really painful to see, especially the possiblity that a long-term friendship might end. The clash of their personal and business philosophies was starkly revealed by the cameras: Kaleil is confident and brash; Tom is more laid back, but capable in a quiet way. Both work at a frenetic pace with cell phones sprouting from their heads, never sleeping, never eating right. It is a wonder they did not collapse.
I would have liked to have known a little more about the backgrounds of the main players in this drama....what they had done after college, their family dynamics and so on.",1006992000,3,1480,4.588679245283019

In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded.

1628194,5,B00005N5TE,"I've watched many documentaries but nothing comes closer to home for me than ""Startup.com"" which features the rise and fall of the American dream.
I'm sure many people who worked for a rise and fall dot.com can watch this documentary and see their company and its founders similar to Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman and govworks.com.
I'm always amazed by the quality of the documentaries comming from Pennebaker Hegedus Films and Noujaim Films.
From politics to the beginning of a startup company, they did an amazing job showing the beginning of making a company, co-founders having problems with one another and the roller coaster of emotions that is displayed throughout the complete 103 minutes.
You are seeing genuine emotions, these are not Hollywood actors, you are watching young businessman trying to make their own startup succeed and the results when friendships is tested.
The movie is featured via 5.1 Dolby surround.  Don't expect too much from the audio because it is a documentary.  No special effects here.
As for special features, we are treated to a special featurette titled ""Documentarians on Documentary"" and the movie trailer.  Also, commentary by the directors is available.
Although I wish there was more included in this DVD, especially perhaps some footage of the guys with their new startup or somehow commenting about their feelings of the actual documentary.

1628195,3,B00005N5TE,"After an abrupt start, 'startup.com' is quite an entertaining documentary about two high-school friends, Tom and Kaleil, setting up an internet company, but its pleasures are almost entirely negative.  it's refreshing to see the bright, shiny multi-million hype of the internet industry filmed in cheap, grainy digital.  it is good to see loudly over-ambitious entrepreneurs stabbing themselves in the back as great projects go horribly wrong.  It's fascinating, in a kind of scientific experiment Zola would have been proud of, to see the relationship between two long-time friends put into the incubator of commerce and slowly disintegrate.  For someone completely alien to this world, it is instructive to see how business operates, and, more precisely, the limits you can reach with youth, hype and intelligence - the success of increasing amounts of bogus motiveation needed as things unravel is telling.  And it is always refreshing to see the machinations of not particularly sympathetic, but articulate and bright young men.
This is a film about a new subject that tells a very old American story about the promise of hope and fortune emerging from little or nothing.  These guys just need to talk and they seem to sprout money.  these pioneers try to connect with another American story, that of Thoreau, the Romantics and nature - there is an exquisitely embarrassing sequence when Tom takes their staff to his country home and encourages them to listen to the trees.
It is always intriguing to see the personal stories behind the public news, in this case the rise and fall of the internet boom; and there is some marvellous footage of Kaleil meeting with President Clinton and offering him his card.
Nevertheless, the film has its flaws.  For me, there is the perennial issue of credibility in these documentaries - would these people really be so suicidallly honest in front of a camera, no matter how familiar the people behind it, especially in moments of crisis?  There is also a lack of faith in the Direct Cinema fly-on-the-wall method (the film, produced by the great DA Pennebecker, places itself in a contentious tradition of the documentary), with the imposing of symbolic vignettes (e.g. Tom fixing his daughter's plaits to get both sides even, prologue to a story about two friends going off-kilter), or the biased structuring (Tom is a family man, his soul is saved; Kaleil is so egomaniacally obsessed with the business, his relationships lapse, and his gestures of religion seem insincere).
My main problem is with the digital film-making - this, rather like the Internet, once promised greater freedom for film-makers in its cheapness, accessibility and portability, but the framing in this film is often heavy and intrusive.  Further, the increasing indifference among film-makers to the texture and form of the image, their faith in flat, monotonous, murky shots, only obscures stories and can become dull.  If directors cannot bring the visual wit of a Vinterberg or Figgis to digital, than maybe its eminence will be less assured than was once promised.",1002844800,14,3085,5.125498007968128
1628196,4,B00005N5TE,"Startup.com is one of the best 2001 films now available on DVD. It is a documentary and about the trials and tribulations of a start up internet company but it also  a Heart-wrenching, emotionally involving story about hopes, dreams and friendships.
We watch as a group of friends begin their company (in May of 1999) and in less than 2 years are running a 50 million-dollar corporation employing over 250 people (Govworks.com). And then it all begins to fall apart rapidly.  We watch as CEO  Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and to a slightly lesser extent Tom Herman become famous via business magazine covers, columns, articles, television news programs, CNN interviews, and even a meeting with a President in which Kaleil suggests the President Clinton  consider working for his company when his presidential term is over.  It's all here and it really happened.
The film-makers shot for over two years and were editing the more than 400 hours of video/film right up to their Sundance premiere in early 2001 and re-edited the last few minutes of the film just prior to it's theatrical release in May of 2001.
Jehane Noujaim started the film. Noujaim became Kaleil Tuzman Harvard roommate and they remained good friends.  After quitting her job at MTV with plans to go to her homeland Egypt to make a film Noujaim instead began filming Tuzman as he quit his job to begin this company with his old high school chum and a small circle of friends.  She contacted Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker  for help in financing the project.  They were excited about the idea and Hegedus enthusiastically became a partner in the project.  Hedges and her husband, D.A. Pennebaker  made the excellent  Moon over Broadway (about Carol Burnett's return to Broadway) and The War Room (behind the scenes of Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign) in recent years. Pennebaker is the legendary documentary filmmaker who made the famous film about Bob Dylan,  Don't Look Back and Monterrey Pop.  Pennebaker produced the film and Hegedus and Noujaim  co-directed it.
The filmmakers have access to some remarkable private moments, some confidential private meetings and some very special events (like Bill Clinton and in another scene with a speech from former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson.).  At times the film doesn't take quite enough time to explain some of the inner-workings of financing the company  and we don't spend quite enough time on the problems and development of the software itself--but to do so would have meant slowing the movie down and focusing it more on the business and less on the people involved.  Every once in a while you can be confused with what is going or why but, life doesn't stop and explain itself to you as well as it should either.  If it's a flaw, it's one that is easy to over-look.
I wish the filmmakers did include a little more footage of the special relationship Tom Herman had with some of his co-workers.  He was the one who insisted on  hiring women in the company and he had a much warmer management style which we don't see much of in the film.
There's some moments in the film, particularly at the end, where the film-makers deliver just the right balance of verite' and crossing over the line a bit for the sake of some much needed humor.  I don't want to spoil a few moments by saying more than that, but there are several subtle pay-offs, which occur during the film's final moments, which end the film on a very human and ironic note.  This is a film about a lot more than the rise and fall of a dot com company.
The film was shot on digital video and is present in the original perspective it was shot in Standard 1:33:1.  The picture is sharp and clear and free from any technical problems whatsoever but it is documentary film-making on the fly and cinema verite'.
The Audio is a strong Dolby 5.1 mix The sound quality varies slightly because of the manner in which the film was shot and the sound originally recorded.  However we can clearly hear all of the important dialogue and at times, when the film gets very quiet, we are aware how free from defects the audio actually is.
The too short interview with the documentary filmmakers gives a face to the filmmakers.  Some of the information they talk about on-camera is repeated during their feature audio commentary.  The very thorough production notes are appreciated.  It is a real shame however that not all of the pre-release extras that were announced by Artisan several months ago are on the disc.  Extra footage, and commentary from Kaleil and Tom would be a huge asset to the DVD package and I can only assume there were last minute problems that meant the plans to include such commentary had to be scrapped.
The feature length commentary track starts out by covering the same ground as the short interview featurette but after 30 minutes we start learning some interesting details and getting some insights into things we are not seeing on the screen.  We learn some interesting information and even about a tragedy that occurred to one of the people we see during the film.  It's well worth the time to listen to the commentary but it can't top one of my favorite commentaries of all time  (the one on Moon Over Broadway).

1628197,5,B00005N5TE,"This film is a nonfiction documentary of an actual start-up.  The company, called GovWorks.com, was designed to facilitate interaction between citizens and government.  One sample application was allowing a citizen to pay a parking ticket on line.
GovWorks is very representative of companies that were started in 1999-2000.  It got funded well before it had any proven revenue model, and it generated a lot of buzz.  The CEO made the cover of a number of magazines, and he even appeared on a panel with President Clinton, as shown in the documentary.  However, they had not gone public prior to the crash in April 2000, so when they did not have a revenue model the company collapsed.
The documentary focuses primarily on two of the founders--Kaleil and Tom.  They had been friends for over ten years prior to founding the company, and their relationship has ups and downs, culminating in Kaleil firing Tom.
Even if you have no interest in start-ups, the relationship between Kaleil and Tom is gripping.  They are more dramatic than the ""characters"" in many fictional movies.  These are real human beings, not superheroes or cardboard villains.
I think that the movie also is instructional.  If you start a business, you have to be prepared for tremendous pressure, and you need to be able to deal with your partners under stress.  When you watch the two protagonists start to come apart under pressure, don't think it couldn't happen to you.
Personally, for an Internet business, I have always favored the bootstrapping model over the venture-capital-funded model.  I believe very strongly in spending time in front of customers as opposed to spending time in front of VC's.
I think this movie pretty clearly reinforces my position.  GovWorks followed the VC script of trying to spend your way to success.  The dismal results were fairly typical.",1001808000,4,1848,5.0

Success comes swiftly and the cameras are right there to capture the deals, the frustrations and, perhaps even most exciting, the moments where friendships collide with business relationships.
There are no actors in this film.  These are the real people and the cameras were in on meetings, waking people up in the morning, riding in the car with them, listening in on their phone conversations and pretty much everything else in order to give an accurate picture of what was going on in the creation and management of govWorks.com.

As someone who has lived through a startup I couldn't help but reminisce every single problem and success these guys endured.  There's a lesson here if this truly is a recurring blueprint for the birth of a company (possibly captured more succinctly by FJ Lennon in 'Every Mistake in the Book').
While the movie falls short in documenting the real decline of the mechanics of their business it excels in showing the decline on the people side.  The greed, insecurities, ambitions, and pettiness of each person is brought out to varying degrees based on how well or badly things are going.  The personalities of people who you feel you have a grip on, change before your very eyes.  How much more exciting it is to see a 'reality' show that's not provoking people into being interesting.  The strains and successes provide the catalyst for an incredibly interesting people dynamic.  And ultimately why the dream of working at a company with your best friends invokes the thought that one should be careful what they wish for.
The film makers do a particularly strong job of being in the right place at the right time to capture key events.  And it all hauntingly reflects my experiences.  From the embarassing 'rah rah'/'go team' meetings to the vicious reality of the VC prostitution circuit to the joy of hitting key milestones like the public release of their website or securing money to the greed that sinks its teeth into people who don't pull their weight and are called on it to the daunting realization that all hope is lost and one is in way over one's head to the final reflection on the wreckage that is left - it is all here.
For those who sat back during this crazy period in comfortable safe jobs, it is a chance to see what all the fuss was about.

1628207,4,B00005N5TE,"Democratic capitalism is the most successful economic system devised by humankind. Alas, it is also akin to political democracy in that it is unnerving and somewhat yucky to closely observe the actual sausage making process. This documentary is a must see for anybody desiring to further comprehend the recent dot.com economic debacle. Long time chums Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman become partners hoping ""to eliminate frustration in the public sector."" The GovWorks website encourages citizens to interact financially with their government agencies. One could pay traffic tickets or taxes, and even bid on seized property among a myriad of other possibilities. We get to observe the adventure of this start up until it closes down less than two years later. This business model is a certain winner in the long run. Unfortunately, as Lord Keynes once sardonically remarked, we are all dead in the long run. The free market generally rewards only those successful in a shorter time frame. Much is made of the so called first mover advantage. Conveniently overlooked, however, is the cold fact that the second movers are often able to take advantage of the mistakes committed by the pioneers. Tuzman and Herman soon learn that attempting to hit the proverbial home run also significantly increases the odds of striking out.
Our under thirty years of age duo bravely endure the long hours and never ending obstacles threatening their dream. They initially agree to share the power until realizing that this management structure is doomed to fail. The resulting crisis inevitably tests their friendship to the breaking point. Tuzman is something of a lightning rod for abuse and criticism. He makes enemies with relative ease. Is this merely the price of leadership, or does Tuzman possess a damaging character flaw? I suspect the former, but concede that my opinion is highly debatable.
Many people gleefully gloat that Tuzman and Herman deserved their comeuppance. I believe that a fair-minded viewer of ""Startup.com"" will instead credit these two gentlemen with the courage and perhaps foolhardiness to reach for the stars. After all, we are ultimately the beneficiaries of their risk taking and creativity. The film makers should have added another fifteen-twenty minutes to flesh out the rise and fall of GovWorks. This is especially true with their flippant handling of the scene wherein Tuzman is talking to President Bill Clinton. Sitting next to Tuzman is Robert Putnam of ""Bowling Alone"" fame who was one ofTuzman's Harvard University professors. Coincidentally, it should be added is that Putnam is a specialist in facilitating improved relationships between governments and the common folk. Isn't it therefore reasonable to suppose that Putnam had at least something to do with the very conceptualization of the GovWorks idea? This movie earns four stars. It could have been better, but the finished product still deserves a large audience. Investors and entrepreneurs should not even consider beginning a new dot.com business venture until they have viewed ""Startup.com.""",991612800,4,3085,5.297959183673469
7946156,3,B00005N5TE,"I rented this documentary after reading a positive review by Leonard Maltin. I wasn't quite as engaged as he was. Maybe it's the fact that this film is old enough that the events captured are no longer surprising. Also, I did feel a little manipulated at times as the point of view was fairly narrow, mainly the two ""founders"" I suppose for narrative clarity. It certainly convinced me to never aspire to a venture capital software based startup.  What an incredible ego it takes to sell your self and your vision to silicon valley! Worthwhile viewing but not essential.",1482883200,,570,4.757575757575758

7946162,5,B00005N5TE,"This movie focuses on a business that is a startup being followed during the dot com bust.

For a business major or anyone interested in business, I suggest watching this movie. Even if it wasn't a dot com era, it really does show how quickly things can change positive and negative for a start up business. The main characters are shown in a very realistic view, they must make hard decisions and are often shown how hard business can be.

Really a great movie to watch, like a reality show but it shows how peoples lives are shifted for the good and bad.",1430265600,,556,4.388349514563107
7946163,3,B00005N5TE,This was an interesting story of a failed startup and I enjoyed watching it.  The cinematography nearly got in the way of that.  I think the scene with the magazine article clips stands as the worst segment I've ever seen - the camera is zoomed way too far in so you get no idea what the article says and it almost gave me a headache to watch it.,1419292800,,346,4.073529411764706
