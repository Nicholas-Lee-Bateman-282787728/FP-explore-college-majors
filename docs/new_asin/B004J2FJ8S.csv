8431533,5,B004J2FJ8S,"beyond description are the talents for singing and acting of KTK, I've only seen her live once but what a delightful performance it was--(in Toronto) This bio and some of her dvd recordings continue to give hours of pleasureand am now impatiently waiting for the CD 'Waiata'",1384473600,,274,4.851063829787234
8431534,4,B004J2FJ8S,"Dame Kiri has one of the most glorious voices in the classical world of opera.  To hear her story from birth in New Zealand and to where destiny has taken her has been not only inspiring but a privilege.  The biography gives an excellent insight into the training and work required to learn the operatic roles. I would be happy to have seen more video of Dame Kiri on stage, but I have enjoyed all that this DVD has offered and will continue to enjoy it for years to come.",1362096000,2,472,4.233333333333333
