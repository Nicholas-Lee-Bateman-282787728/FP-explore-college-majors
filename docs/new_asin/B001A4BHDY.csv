8275997,5,B001A4BHDY,"I bought this out of curiosity thought hmmmm Expanded Entertainment made a third Outragous animation. So I ploped down 17.95 for the tape and waited about a week and I got it. Then when I looked at the box cover I was like hmmmm.... sure doesn't look like a outragous animation but when I put the VHS tape into the vcr, sure enough it was. It had the same animation sequence like the others and the animations on the tape are well not ""OUTRAGEOUS"" but more of the lines of weird, and strange. Two examples of this would have to be ""Little Red Riding Hood"", and ""Organ House"" In little red riding hood the animation looks like it was done by five 2nd graders. The story of litlle red riding but more the lines of more sexuality in it. The animation is pretty bad and the story really makes no sence. Made me really wonder, like why would a 10 year old girl know how to preform sexual acts like blowjobing, and 69ing? Then I also made another question ""Is little red ridding hood from the ghetto?"" Really nothing else I can sa about Little red Riding hood but lets now move on to Organ House. This little weird animation opens up by saying ""ORGAN HOUSE IS NOT FOR THE FAINTEST OF HEARTS"". So am like ""oh kay, let's see what we got here"". And I watched it and there wasn't anything scary there I even showed it to my easly scared to anything and after watching it he said ""WHAT...This is not scary HA HA HA HA are those suppost to be Organs GA HA HA HA HA HA. And thats saying a LOT. Well in organ house it a ""OLD"" CG Animation for the early 90s (like 1992 I think) and we get shown the outside of the Common ""Classic white"" Scary home. Then we get shown the interor of the home, which is organs. Then near the ending out of no where this skeleton comes out and says welcome. Also the animation piece is one mintue and I question if they ""cut"" some of it out. Well other than those 2 animation pieces I would say the rest are funny as hell. There is this one animation called Guano! which sort of reminds me of Newgrounds R.A.B. What it is shorts on shorts about werid animals with big noses that do micheveous stuff. Also 2 Things need to be cleared up 1.)there are 27 animations (inculding a animation called Werid Beard which is spliced into 5 parts.) 2. the tape time ends at 98 mins not 88 mins. 3rd The sexuality in the fim is about 70% Violence about 85% and Boring 5%. This tape has to be the 3rd most well produced animation VHS tape I have seen in years. So I would advise to get this tape for people that LOVE animation, Rare VHS tape collectors because I don't think u can't find this tape for under 33 dollars which is pretty rare in VHS standards. So if u got the money enjoy some of the weridest, and possibley funny animated shorts you've ever seen!",1271808000,,2762,4.213207547169811
