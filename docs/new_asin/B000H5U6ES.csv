8136767,5,B000H5U6ES,"Jungle Adventures is a collection of jungle adventure movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about 75 cents per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that hardly any of these movies are available on other public domain collections. Additionally, there is a Tarzan radio episode included.  All in all, Jungle Adventures  is a great 12 movie collection.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Jungle Adventures:

Great:

The Lost Jungle (1934)
Tarzan and the Green Goddess (1938)

Good:

Savage Girl (1932)
Tarzan the Fearless (1933)
Jungle Bride (1933)
Blonde Savage (1947)

Average:

Lion Man (1936)
Drums of Africa (1941)
Law of the Jungle (1942)
Tiger Fangs (1943)
Forbidden Jungle (1950)

Bad:

Escape from Angola (1976)",1206144000,16,999,4.916167664670659
8136768,3,B000H5U6ES,I have yet to watch this DVD through...wanted it as it has movies I enjoyed as I grew up. Takes me down memory lane.,1199145600,,116,3.875
8136769,3,B000H5U6ES,"I've gotten defective discs on some ST. CLAIR box sets. Video transfers can be lacking in clarity and brightness, with compression too obvious in spots. ""You get what you pay for"" is the rule of thumb here.

JUNGLE trivia:

A supporting cast member in BLONDE SAVAGE, John Dehner, was once an animation assistant for Walt Disney. Dehner also starred on radio as Paladin in HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL.

Ivan Tors, producer of such TV series as FLIPPER, SEA HUNT and GENTLE BEN, appears in ESCAPE FROM ANGOLA with his entire family in tow.

LAW OF THE JUNGLE's director, Jean Yarbrough, also worked with Abbott & Costello. Supporting actor Feodor Chaliapin Jr. was the son of a very famous Russian opera star.

THE LION MAN was written by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs.

THE LOST JUNGLE is an edited-down movie serial. It stars Clyde Beatty, who was a real-life big game hunter and lion tamer. Beatty fronted his own traveling circus, and performed an act where he entered a cage filled with up to 40 animals of several species, including lions, tigers, cougars and hyenas.

TARZAN THE FEARLESS is another whittled-down movie serial. This was Buster Crabbe's only portrayal of Tarzan. Crabbe did star as a generic king of the jungle in a few other films.

Frank Buck (""TIGER FANGS"") was a hunter and animal collector. Buck was also a movie actor, director, writer and producer. He appeared in several jungle-related films including AFRICA SCREAMS, with Abbott & Costello. Buck's co-star here, Duncan Renaldo portrayed the Cisco Kid on TV.
