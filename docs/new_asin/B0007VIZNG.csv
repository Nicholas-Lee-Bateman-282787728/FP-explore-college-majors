8052255,5,B0007VIZNG,"""My Boys Are Good Boys"" is clever, fast-paced, surprisingly well-acted, and full of surprises. Cheapness is it's difficulty, but once you let yourself get drawn into the interaction between the characters, and the story escalates, this can stand with any heist film.
MBAGB deserved to have been polished up and remade with the same cast, same everybody (ya gotta love the randy, sleezeball cop); the way that low budget ""Evil Dead"" was re-made into one the greatest-ever horror films, ""Evil Dead II"".
MBAGB is more than cult-just accept the fact that you're in for low budget- and what a ride-cheap, but real thrills, great car chases, and whackily plausable improvisations by our group of larcenous young misfits!",1279497600,,714,5.111111111111111
8052256,3,B0007VIZNG,"Colleen Meeker, Ralph's youngish wife, spread the word in 1977, that for any actors who were ""hungry"" to work, to get some film done on them, she was putting together a picture. Keenan Wynn helped me to get an audition, and I was cast in the film as a Reformatory Guard. There were no direct-to-video films made at that time. Most of the actors, myself included, turned our paychecks back into the producer's kitty with promises of payback when the film opened. It never opened in a theatre to my knowledge. There was a full page ad in Variety at one point ( I saved that ), and it was reputed to have been broadcast once on late night LA local TV. It was an under the radar production. I never received a dime for doing it, and there never has been residuals.  It was a slim budgeted tax write off, and it gave several over-the-hill burned out Hollywood actors one more shot in front of the cameras; specifically Lloyd Nolan, Ida Lupino, and Ralph Meeker. David Doyle, pre-CHARLIE'S ANGELS, had a prominent part. My scenes were with him.

It was ""directed"" by Bethel ""Buck"" Buckalew, aka Peter Perry, and Arthur P. Stootsberry. He cast himself as a cop in one scene. He is one of the  just below the surface Hollywood types that had been around since the late '50's, and functioned as a producer, writer, actor, second unit director, and sometimes director in dozens of terrible, yet wonderfully bizarre Independent seen-by-almost no one films; like KNOCKERS UP (1963), and CYCLE VIXENS (1978).

In 1977, I was almost embaressed by the film, by having my name associated with it. But after all these decades, I sat with a film group and viewed a copy of the movie last month, and everyone laughed and enjoyed it immensily. It was very camp, full of 70's hair-do's, and car chases, and wretched dialogue. Lloyd Nolan was the only actor who rose above the material. The film is now building a cult following. Go figure.",1158883200,2,1918,4.599415204678363
