8157058,5,B000KI0VLK,"I just love these DVDs! Whenever I use ""What Do Catholics Really Believe"" the RCIA group comments on how much they love it and how much they learned. It is done in a way that keeps your attention - using a bit of humor and Scripture, along with Church Traditions!  In fact, I have two sets; one in the cabinet in case I lose the one set!",1365638400,2,337,4.029850746268656

8157060,5,B000KI0VLK,"I love this series. I've learned so much and it was very enjoyable to watch. There are so many truths here that everyone should hear....not just catholics. If everyone would watch this, there would be no more crazy assumptions about what catholics believe. This is a must for any catholic or non-catholic who wants to learn the truth.",1318464000,,334,4.775862068965517
8157061,5,B000KI0VLK,My pastor is using this in our parish for adult on-going Catholic education.  It is amazing how some of our own Catholics in the pews believe these same mis-conceptions.  Other Catholics have friends and relatives that believe false information about the Catholic Church.  There is excellent free downloadable material to suppliment the DVD series.  This can be used for discussion after the 35 minute lesson.  It is very orthodox Catholic teaching.  My pastor has decided to use this series once a year in order to strengthen our parish and reinforce authentic Catholic teaching.,1315180800,4,580,5.182795698924731
8157062,5,B000KI0VLK,"I have just begun viewing this program. The information discussed is exactly what I Need to confirm about my faith. I am Catholic, and sometimes hear people speak negative things about catholics. The Matters discussed are issues that I need confirmation about. For Catholics that have lived a good life, this dvd may confirm many questions that you may have. So far I am getting a lot of good spiritual confidence in my walk. God Bless.",1301702400,3,436,4.75
8157063,5,B000KI0VLK,"These videos contain the 13-week series on What Catholics Really Believe. The series is informative, to the point, and even funny at times. You are given the perspective from a priest and a layman and scientist. Every student of Catholicism should view this series.",1250553600,10,265,5.045454545454546
8157064,5,B000KI0VLK,"Excellent information that has been misrepresented and misunderstood. When you tell a lie long enough, it morphs into the truth. Dr. Ray debunks the lies and unlocks the immutability of the truth. Excellent source for getting the basics of the Catholic Faith right. Bishop Sheen would have been proud of this video.",1250467200,8,315,5.076923076923077
8157065,4,B000KI0VLK,"First off, the 3 disc listing is incorrect. This 13 episode series is divided into 2 discs. Episodes 1-6 on disc A and Episodes 7-13 on disc B. Each episode is approximately 28 minutes long. Dr. Ray Guarendi and Fr. Kevin Fete (prounounced fate) debate and answer common misconceptions about Catholicism and the non scriptural beliefs many Protestants adhere themselves to. Dr Ray will sometimes take on the role of an antagonistic Protestant as Fr. Fete gently and charitably explains the Catholic position through the use of scriptures. They also use the writings of the early church fathers, mostly within the first two centuries and the Church's nearly 2000 year history. Getting Bible-only believing Christians to understand that the Catholic Church existed for 350 years before there was an actual Bible, and that it was the Catholic church that gave it to us, does not sit well with them at all. In fact even most Catholics are ignorant of when the Church started and how the Bible came to be. I would love to see Dr. Guarendi revise this series, but this time having Fr. John Corapi. For those who don't know, Fr. Corapi is a no nonsense, tells it like it is, your personal feelings do not matter, truth is truth so get over it, and yourself priest.
