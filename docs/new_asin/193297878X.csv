7801644,4,193297878X,There is alot of information on this dvd. At least more than I knew. I found the info on deer hides very interesting. I will look at my purchasing deer hair differently now. The part on tying was somewhat short and for me the main reason I purchased the dvd. That is why it only got 4 stars. I wish Chris would have cut the amount of time spent on the hides and put more into spinning the hair. I no he has older tapes on spinning deer hair but I wanted the newer one in HD so I could see the detail better. I am not sorry I purchased this dvd and the info on it is good. Chris is one of the best deer hair tyers around. This dvd might be the best starting point out there on the subject.,1300492800,2,688,3.852112676056338
