8482465,4,B005PF9LYG,"The story starts out with a sweet boy who has a grown male imaginary friend who wants to be an astronaut.  Then his parents have twins, he's allowed to have a tv and everything changes.  He starts watching the news and becomes a violent kid who wants to be a soldier, but we don't find out why until the very end of the film.  The mother blames the boy watching TV for his violent behavior, the parents are constantly fighting due to the twins which is causing the boy to hate them as he blames them for the downfall of his family life.  That's the base of the story.  Concepts like this have been done before.  What sets this one apart is the imaginary friend.  He shows the conflict going on in the boy's mind.  But it's the very end, what the boy says about becoming a soldier and Danny Glover's monologue during the credits that are amazing.

The writing is very well done, all the actors do a great job, but I'll admit I checked this out due to Robert Englund being in it.  The one problem I had was I can't tell where exactly they're living as the boy and his father sound American, yet others around them, including the mother, are British.  But even with that it's a worthwhile film I think that should be shown to younger children, even with the good deal of cursing and mild amount of violence.  You'll understand once to hear the very end of the film.",1322611200,2,1362,4.298039215686274
