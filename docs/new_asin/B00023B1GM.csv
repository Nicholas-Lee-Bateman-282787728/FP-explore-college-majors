2057150,3,B00023B1GM,"I had seen this movie many years ago,and thought that it did a fairly good job of portraying the art of
Shorinji Kenpo. It was truly one of Sonny Chiba's best. For the action, it is worth watching.",1330387200,,197,4.2105263157894735
2057151,4,B00023B1GM,"Being a karate practitioner and all-around martial arts geek, Sonny Chiba is definitely a favorite of mine, especially there's not too many big-time Japanese/Okinawan-born karate stylists in the movie industry. So when I saw a Sonny Chiba movie for three bucks? Had to get it, and I was not disappointed.  I'll say this though: if you're expecting the same thing you saw in the Street Fighter series, this will disappoint you.  Sonny Chiba doesn't play the cold-hearted bastard type that Terry Surugi is known for  This movie doesn't have much mindless violence or nudity. It's more of historical piece  It's set in post-WWII Japan, and gives a glimpse at the struggles the Japanese had to go through in the aftermath - women prostituting themselves to feed their kids, American soldiers and local gangsters terrorizing the people, soldiers losing everything and everyone they had in their lives before the war.  Chiba's is probably at his most heroic in his portrayal of Doshin So, creator of Shorinji Kempo. If you're a Chiba fan, this is a good movie to put in the collection",1328572800,4,1078,4.933701657458563
2057152,3,B00023B1GM,"If you are looking for a good action-packed karate film that is set in the past then this one is for you. BUT, if you want to see Sonny Chiba as a ONE MAN ARMY with great and long fighting scenes as in Soul of Chiba, Street Fighter, Executioner and Karate Warriors then this one is NOT for you!

The fighting scenes in this movie were good but not spectacular and they were a little short. At least, the acting and the story were much better. This is the kind of movie that Sonny Chiba made so he could show the audience a more serious version of himself and not a ONE MAN ARMY macho man with cheesy stories.

Adios.",1283040000,3,616,4.125
2057153,5,B00023B1GM,"Shorinji Kenpo is an extrapolation of what in Chinese is call Shao Lin School. It is very brave indeed for Doshin Sho to establish a dojo on Shao Lin after the war when many people in Japan still hated the Chinese. In any event, I am a fan of Sonny Chiba. As a senior instructor of a Kung Fu school and a black belt in Ju Jit Su, I can appreciate Sonny Chiba's fighting prowess. I think his martial arts sequences are excellent and realistic. There are some memorable scenes in this movie such as: (1). When Mr Chiba as a child was hit many times by his mother for a crime he didn't commit. Later, in front of her grave he said: ""Mother, you taught me how to endure but I choose to fight using my own strength; (2). When Mr Chiba saved Kiku for the second time, we can see from the expression in her face how grateful she was; (3). When one of his students lost his arm in a fight and wallowed in self pity, Mr Chiba tried to instill in him a sense of self-confidence by provoking him to attack him (Mr Chiba); (4). When Mr Chiba was thrown by an advanced Judo practitioner, in the air he managed to hit his opponent. This is a feat I have never seen; (5). When Mr Chiba cannot save Kiku, he realised that love and power should be conjoined together. He made appropriate changes in his school's motto. There are many other entertaining scenes but, the above should whet your appetite. This movie has very great entertainment value for martial arts aficionados.

2057154,2,B00023B1GM,I am a big fan of all MA styles and movies.  I didn't like this one at all.  I am familiar with US Shorinji Kempo and was thinking I would see some good stuff here.  Other than a few wrist locks there was little to enjoy.  Acting was horrible and execution was pretty poor.... Just my two cents.,1214870400,,295,4.0344827586206895
2057155,5,B00023B1GM,"When i first saw this film, it totally blew me away. I ordered this film thinking I was going to get nothing but senseless karate action with a moderate story plot. But instead I received it both ways. Incredible action, incredible story. The story was very dramatical. It was almost like a true war story, even though some of the events are fiction. It tells a tale of a japenese spy who  gets fed up when he finds out that his country surendered and then he begins to loose control and starts killing everyone in his sight. He is then sent to a jail only to find out by a jail forman that he wants him to escape and leave out of sight. He then escapes and opens up his own martial arts school. Where he founded his own style (kenpo). He is then confronted with challenges around him that conflicts his school. That is when he has no choice but to become a killing machine. Sonny chiba is an incredible actor. I have only seen films such as the street fighter by him. But i never seen him act so dramatically in this role.

This is a great film with incredible martial arts fights and a touching story line. I highly recomended you buy this film.",1178841600,3,1147,4.28110599078341
2057156,5,B00023B1GM,"Along with his bio films on the life of karate legend Mas Oyama, Sonny Chiba Shinichi made this film about the life of the founder of Shorinji Kempo, So Doshin. (Chiba actually holds legitimate black belt rankings in both kyokushin karate and Shorinji kempo). As other reviewers have properly pointed out, this film was terribly misnamed for English speaking audiences as """"Killing Machine,"" which of course Master So was no such thing. He was, however, a true defender of the weak, a man who believed that love, peace, and justice, backed up by the power to punish, is the true way in martial arts and the way to an orderly society. I own both the VHS, English dubbed version (the one I saw in the movie theatre years ago when this film was first released in the USA) and the DVD, Japanese language version with subtitles. Far and away, the latter is the best of the two. So much is lost in the English dubbed version, it is far better to read the subtitles which are much closer to what the actors are actually saying. There is some excellent footage of training at the Shorinji Kempo World HQs in this film and some of the actors are members of the hombu dojo. In my estimation, Master So Doshin, whose life is depicted wonderfully well by Chiba in this film, was a true saint. Buy this DVD and see why.",1178668800,9,1306,4.468619246861925

8021056,5,B00023B1GM,"The Killing Machine (also called: Shorinji Kempo) is my favorite Sonny Chiba film. And this is THE version to get. I have another copy of this that is much lower quality. Here you get the film in the original Japanese, with English subtitles, and in a very nice anamorphic wide screen format. The picture quality is also much better than the other version of the film that I own.

If you like Sonny Chiba I recommend this one for your collection; if you like this movie and are trying to get a decent quality DVD of it I recommend it even more. Be aware that there is no dubbed English track included on the disk, so if you don't speak Japanese and don't like reading subtitles in movies then I guess I would look elsewhere.",1422403200,2,724,4.362962962962963
8021057,5,B00023B1GM,"For a movie made in the 70's the choreography was pretty fast and fluid and although there is more crying in this, more than any other Martial Arts movie I've ever seen,  at least it had a story line,  plot,  and characters they really wanted you to care about! If you've seen as many Kung-Fu movies from that era as I have you'd know why this one is a standout! But let's not forget the main reason to see this film, Sonny Chiba,  whose charisma alone takes this movie to a higher level than most!",1418342400,,498,4.2105263157894735
8021058,4,B00023B1GM,"DVD Review: Concerning the Adness DVD. All these Sonny Chiba movies from Adness rule. That's all you need to know.

Movie Review: This one of Sonny Chiba's more coherent movies that isn't quite as non-sensical as most his other movies from the 70's like Executioners or the Oyama trilogy. The story is good and the karate action is wonderful. And it's fun seeing him cut off a guy's wee-wee and feed it to a dog.

Conclusion: 5 stars for the DVD and 4 stars for the movie.",1413849600,,472,4.413793103448276

8021060,4,B00023B1GM,I love Sonny Chiba and i love this movie. I hadn't seen this movie since the mid 90s when i used to walk down to my local video store and rent out old martial arts movies. It doesn't have as much action as the Street Fighter movies but it's still good. The remastered picture and sound is beautiful. This version is in japanese but its subtitled. It has a ton of old trailers of other Sonny Chiba movies too.,1368403200,,408,4.177215189873418
8021061,2,B00023B1GM,"I'm not a die-hard fan of Sonny Chiba movies, so it's not like I was disappointed with this particular film by him. It's just that the description for this movie hyped it up quite a bit but when I watched it, I thought maybe I was watching a different movie.

The transfer on DVD is good. The picture is clean and the sound is good. So as far as quality of the DVD goes... it's great.

The movie itself wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
Let me break down the description with my opinions:
>Sonny Chiba stars as Doshin So (actually it's ""Soh"", but whatever), a martial arts master who returns from the second World War after serving as an undercover spy.<
This is true, although barely dealt with except for a few brief minutes in the beginning of the film. He's discovered, gets into a fight and kicks everyone's butts all around. Then that's all there is about that.

>Upon his return, he finds that his family's land has been stolen.<
Ummm... I must have missed this, because I don't remember them even talking about or dealing with this as part of the story.

>Doshin must also take back the town from a group of black marketers and to rebuild his life.<
He fights some black marketers, but ""to rebuild his life""? Not quite. It was just a convenient fight scene.

>He also helps a group of war orphans to get back on their feet including a young girl forced into prostitution.<
Again... true somewhat. He does help them, for like all of 7 or 8 minutes. Then he has to leave them because he has to leave town. So they are on their own and leaves you wondering what is to become of them with him gone.

>In typical Chiba fashion, it's time to make someone pay!<
I don't know who he was trying trying to ""make pay"", but there seemed to be a lot of fight scenes but no real consistent enemy that he had to fight against.

This story was kind of all over the place. I don't really think they had an actual plot, just a bunch of ideas for fight scenes and decided to film them together and try to make a buck.
And as for the fight scenes, they are ""okay"". There really isn't a lot of amazing action and most of them are over with pretty quickly.

I like some cheesy kung-fu movies, so it's not like I expected a lot out of this but this movie left me disappointed. I expected more from it (a coherent story, fantastic fight scenes) and was left with a mediocre ""B-"" movie instead.

I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you are a Sonny Chiba fan and want to complete your collection. If that's the case, then this DVD has a great picture and sound.
Otherwise this movie is kind of a let down.",1340064000,,2591,4.271428571428571
