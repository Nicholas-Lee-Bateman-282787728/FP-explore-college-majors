8080616,2,B000ARXG86,"I was born right after the Cold War ended, innocent to the age of fear, hype and all-out scary moments that marked my parents' age. I figured a few old-school ""educational"" videos that the government put out would let me see, first-hand, what it was like to live under the threat of attack during the mid-20th century.

Indeed, I learned plenty. The half-dozen or so shorts that comprise ""Target You"" give viewers a first-hand account of the government's efforts to portray Russians as dangerous, soulless enemies--in contrast to the chipper, gung-ho Americans portrayed in the last few films. There's a feeling of authenticity that flows through the movie, as if you're seeing the heart of the panic and worry that gripped the USA during the 50s, 60s and 70s.

What's the problem, then? Unless you're an avid Cold War fan or a history buff, you're likely to be asleep by the collection's end. The producers seem to have selected the most mundane government-issued shorts possible; from a five-minute segment about the benefits of microfilm to a board hearing on nuclear shelter, many selections teach more about American bureaucracy than about Russia's threats. A few humorous moments pepper ""Target You,"" but they fail to outweigh the droll content that ends up defining the film.

From the cover, one would guess that Target You encompasses the most humorous, outrageous and all-out misinformed propaganda that America's Cold War government had to offer. From the film itself, one would think otherwise.",1209340800,,1506,5.089068825910931
