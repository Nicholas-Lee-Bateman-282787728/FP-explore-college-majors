8658229,5,B0027FG1KE,"This is a beautiful and well-made video of each season in the Rocky Mountains with close-ups of wildlife. There's no narration, just music that compliments each scene. There is plenty of footage of baby animals. Gorgeous still photos are interspersed with the video. Highly recommended!",1241308800,3,286,5.377777777777778
