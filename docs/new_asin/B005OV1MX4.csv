4855107,5,B005OV1MX4,"Amazon often aggregates reviews in a wrong way. Depending on what production you are viewing, here are my reviews:

(Wiener Staatsoper, Zubin Metha). 5 stars. I must disagree with the previous reviewers! OK, there are often strange elements in today's staging of operas. Opera audiences have to live some curious and often annoying conceptions of stage directors. But this production isn't bad! The singers are really world class, and they both sing and act well. Apart form the scene featuring cowboys and indians, I think that the production is coherent and well staged, not least the set design. Picture and sound is beyond praise, as is the playing of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under the direction of Zubin Metha. To give this disc only one star is a depreciation. My wife and I enjoyed it a lot.

(Teatro Regio di Parma, Gianluigi Gelmetti): 4 stars. Even though the first scene is very dark (black clothing, black scenery), and the sets are modern and austere, I quite liked the production. The mass scenes and the dancers are excellent. The singers are generally good, but no more. I liked Roberto Scandiuzzi (Padre Guardiano) best. He has a strong deep bass voice, Vladimir Stoyanov (Don Carlo) is also good, but I've heard better performed ""Urna fatale""s. Aquiles Machado (Don Alvaro) may be a fine tenor, but his voice seems somewhat sharp and uncomfortable. This may be due to the recording, which is dry and lacks ambience. Dimitra Theodossiou (Donna Leonora) does her job OK, but I sometimes found her vibrato too emphasized. Not my favotite Leonora. Marina Pentcheva (Preziosilla) is definetely too wobbly.",1345593600,8,1627,5.0
4855108,1,B005OV1MX4,"This was my first viewing of La Forza and I will try again with another version.  As the first reviewer says, attempts to add color - ie cowboys - when the setting presumably involves Spaniards and Incas - fall flat.  In fact this production involves a mishmash of historical references that just complicate an already complicated (not complex) opera.  Paradoxically, most of the singing is of the old-fashioed 'park and bark' variety!  I'll try another production before I write the opera off completely.",1344470400,5,505,5.048192771084337

8482065,1,B005OV1MX4,"Vocally decent (though absolutely nothing to write home about) but a shockingly distressing production. I have seen hundreds of opera production both on stage and in video, and cannot think of anything nearing the level of aesthetic abuse as this set and costumes. A ridiculous mix of cowboys (and cowgirls) in red with crosses on, abbot and monks dressed in what looks like Muslim clerical costumes, and many others G-d knows what they are, all in scenes of red bloodshed with hanging corpses above them. A fortune teller (dresses as a red cowgirl) going around shooting people with her cowgirl revolver and even a scene that looks as if they kill and dissect a captured boy (and maybe I didn't understand right the idea  but the fact that I could see it that way is enough). This is not even starting to describe this ridiculous mix & match show of horrors.
I like good modern sets and productions to good old operas (and the Vienna Opera Traviata is a great one), but this is not there, not even close.",1475539200,2,1005,4.614525139664805
8482066,3,B005OV1MX4,"Mehta and the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra perform this score at the highest level: dramatically taut with wonderful dynamic contrasts and propulsive rhythms. The singers are excellent, especially Nina Stemme as Leonora, powerfu and beautiful voicel and very involved with the acting. Also Nadia Krasteva has an exceptional voice as Preziosilla: rich low notes and wonderful high notes. Licitra, Alvarez & Miles are all very good. Miles lacks the depth and richness of Ghiaurov in the La Scala performance with Caballe and Carerras, but he sings well. This performance directed by David Pountney, artistic director of the Welsh opera has many absurdities, perhaps as a reaction to some of the silliness of Verdi's peasant scenes with Preziosilla and the Melitone. But having them dressed as cowboys and cowgirls does not relate in any way to the libretto. Sets and costumes were designed by the Zimbabwean stage designer Richard Hudson. I'm curious what his explanation might be for these cowgirl outfits and the business suit for Padre Guardiano, so inappropriate for a monastery. For me it served to distract from the drama taking place thus messing up the total gestalt of this operatic experience.",1469404800,,1200,5.255208333333333

were a mixed bag of monks walking around with lighted torches, colorful Spanish crowd scenes with dances, drinking songs and soldiers marching around. They were audience pleasers, so the average people got their money's worth.

For Verdi's 200th anniversary this certainly wasn't good enough. The very talented designer, Stefano Poda took this opera much more seriously and given it a new meaning, actually the meaning it always should have been there, but wasn't. The opera is about dark fate pursuing the seemingly helpless characters, about resentment, obsessive revenge and the ultimate destruction, such as War. There is also a strong element of Religion and people's escape into it for protection and consolation. All these elements are omnipresent in the dark hued, but monumental sets of monolithic slabs, sometimes pitch black and sometimes shining in silver hues plus a giant sculpted cross radiantly shining and dominating the scenes. So the set design and the stage movements that are very solemn for the religious scenes and disturbing, angular for the war scenes, all contribute to the real meaning of this opera. The dark hues prevail as they should.

The musical handling is also quite different from the traditional bombast, lack of coherence that used to degrade this piece into an uneven, second rate Verdi. Much thought must have been given to the emotional content of every phrase, the proper dynamics (never too loud, but many shades of mezzoforte and piano.

8482072,4,B005OV1MX4,"Let me get my bias out right here from the beginning- I love this opera.  It is my favorite Verdi score after Traviata. It is filled with gorgeous arias and duets, and terrific chorus pieces.  In short, one great tune after another- and packed with emotional drama as well.

I also have a good history with this opera.  Living in Boston, we have GREAT classical music concerts (especially early music-Baroque, etc) but NOT a great opera company.  Perhaps being only 4 hours from New York City has inhibited its development, but there is not a major opera group here, nor has there been.  So my opera viewing since its inception (about 15 years ago), was with smaller companies, venues, etc.  Finally, in 2004, my wife and I attended one of the great opera houses (Covent Garden) where we saw Forza.  Our first experience with opera in a major place- and it was overwhelmingly terrific.  (Violetta Urmana, Salvatore Licitra, Ferruccio Furlanetto) I was even able to get a bootleg audio of the performance as there was a radio broadcast.  What a great souvenir from a special night.

So, this opera is special to me.  At this time I have 14 dvd's of this opera (including many boots- which are unreleased TV broadcasts).  How does this performance stack up to that list?  Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag- some excellent stuff (and performances) and some terrible things as well.  I will detail below.

However, before I get there, I want to make some comments about the opera itself, since I am so familiar with it.

This opera gets a bad rap, mostly for its libretto/story in that some incidents seem ludicrous or the coincidences are just too unrealistic, leaving the whole vastly diminished.  I will detail some of them, and make some comments on that as well.

Leonora, daughter of the Marques of Calatrava, is awaiting her lover Don Alvaro, as they intend to elope, of course against the wishes of her father.  He bursts in on them before they flee, and confronts Alvaro angrily.  Alvaro draws his pistol, but does not intend to shoot her father.  Instead he gives himself up.  In the usual staging of it, he tosses the pistol onto the table in surrender, but it accidentally goes off and shoots her father killing him almost immediately (but not before he curses the two of them!).  (Note, I will comment on how that is staged here below.)  So, the opera begins with a major development that seems a stretch of logic.  BUT, without it, there is no story, so you must give the writer his leeway.  (The rest of the opera deals with the tragic consequences of this event.)  Also, two other points to make here-

1) The opera is based on an early Spanish plan in which this is the key initial event;
2) Many other operas (including Verdis) have similar logical difficulties in their back story (read the plot summary of ""Il Trovatore"" for a start), so this is NOT unusual.

Subsequent to the death of the Marques, there are several coincidences (accidental meetings of persons) that strain the logic further.  In the Act 2 tavern scene, Leonora (fleeing in disguise) ends up in the same tavern as her brother Don Carlo, who is trying to kill her in revenge.  (They do not actually meet, but being in the same place heightens the drama.)  In the major scene in Act 3, Don Alvaro saves the life of Don Carlo, whereby they swear soldier's loyalty to each other, each without knowing who the other really is.  The drama becomes almost excruciating when they discover the truth and engage in a duel (the first of two).  ALL accompanied by incredibly powerful Verdi music.  In the final scene of the opera, they resume their duel (off stage), coincidentally right outside the cave where Leonora, living the life of a repentant hermit to expiate her sins against her father, is located, which allows Don Carlo to stab and kill her in his final revenge, as the curtain falls.

Again, these coincidences, and the developments of the plot (there are more) have been the major criticism leveled at this opera which, I believe, have prevented it from become more popular than it should be.  (The dvd includes a brief video summary in which it states that this is the 11th most performed Verdi opera.)  But I address these ""deficiencies"" in this way-

1.  Many many other operas (including Verdi operas) have far more ludicrous plot developments or revelations regarding the history and relationships of characters (it is an opera staple that anyone thought dead is really alive, and that there are family relationships among the principals that completely change the story and its resolution.)

2.  Here, these developments lead to HIGHLY emotional scenes and music that are exceptionally powerful.

3.  Much of these developments come from the underlying Spanish play which was the source of the libretto.

4.  The opera itself is specifically and consciously designed to highlight these issues- hence the name: ""The Force of Destiny"".  This is often overlooked, so I will elaborate on this point.

Most Verdi operas feature strong, powerful characters who dominate the action and the other characters in the story.  (Too many to enumerate here.)  Verdi specifically wanted to create something different here- a story where the hand of fate is the dominating force, NOT the characters themselves.  Where ""Destiny"" is the all-powerful movant of the action- and for him to depict the human consequences of this.  Again, the title sets this out explicitly- ""The Force of Destiny""- tells us what is really going on here.

This is definitely something different (and not something that Verdi did again).  But it triggers the incredible music that makes the human drama so effective to us.  So, in short, look aside from these plot problems, accept them, and let the drama, and the accompanying music, take you to a different place than Verdi usually goes.  You will love it.

Now, let me discuss the DVD here- which, as I said, I found a bit of a mixed bag.  I'll start with the performances, which are generally excellent.

I really like Aquiles Machado, going back to his first dvd&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donizetti-L-Elisir-d-Amore-Esposito-Machado-Marrucci-Canzian-Schrott-Muus-Macerata-Opera/dp/B0000C7PRD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Esposito, Machado, Marrucci, Canzian, Schrott, Muus, Macerata Opera</a>.  A beautiful voice, and I think he handles the role of Don Alvaro very well, though another reviewer here really despises him.  Dmitra Theodossiou is a big star, with MANY dvd's to her credit.  She sings beautifully as Leonora, with great emotion and conviction.  Vladimir Stoyanov as Don Carlo and Roberto Scandiuzzi as Padre Guardiano are also very good. I particularly liked Carlo lePore as Mellitone, a big, hulking, helpless monk.

As for the production itself, this is really where there are ups and downs.  The set is pretty bare- a slightly raised stage with these massive two walls that get moved around a bit.  No other stage furnishings at all.  In certain scenes (Act 1 in Leonora's home, Act 2 in the tavern) this doesn't work at all, and is quite ineffective.  But for the monastery scene in Act 2 (perhaps my favorite scene of the whole opera) it is quite visually effective.  The massive walls are moved alongside each other with a space in-between, and with a cutout above, you have the outline of a very large cross (see the cover of the dvd) with golden light shining out from behind.  Then, the monks come out carrying torches- very moving.  The final scene removes the walls entirely and has a large fallen cross with rocks (tombstones?) around it that works very well.  One final point (a minor one for me) is that the costumes are awful.

Let me point out one instance where the poor sets really hurt the drama.  In the first scene, when Don Alvaro throws down his pistol in surrender (and it accidentally goes off killing Leonora's father), most stagings (like the Met's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-La-Forza-del-Destino-Remastered/dp/B0009YBYSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - La Forza del Destino, Remastered</a>&nbsp;) have the pistol thrown on the table next to which the Marques is standing.  Not here- because there is no table (or any scenery).  So, he throws the pistol to the ground, and it goes off killing the Marques.  That certainly stretches the credulity of the scene!

In general all of the scenes with the principals listed above are well staged, acted, sung, etc, and very enjoyable.  The real disappointment here are all the scenes with Preziosilla.  They are TERRIBLE!  She is meant to be a gypsy (fortune teller), follower of the military, and supporter of the soldiers.  It's a light, somewhat comic (flirtatious) role (think Beverly Sills in Fille du Regiment).  Here, it is extremely heavy handed, no joy whatsoever and is just a disaster.  (There is very little humor in this whole show except for Mellitone's feuding with the poor in Act 3.)

So, if you ignore the costumes, all scenes with Preziosilla, and some of the early sets, much of the show is quite excellent- and really what is very good here is at the heart of this terrific opera anyway.  Not the best dvd, but still quite good.",1371254400,8,9272,4.984364820846905
8482073,5,B005OV1MX4,"This DVD is excellent in every regard. The orchestra and the singing are superb. The production, though slightly modernistic, was faithful to the text and enhanced the overall experience. This DVD deserves five stars.

I am happy for the chance to review this version of La Forza. For a long time, it has had a ""one-star"" viewer rating --- based on only one reviewer! I fear many potential customers have been scared away from buying it. What was the negative reviewer's complaint?  The presence of cowboys and cowgirls in two scenes of the production. But these weren't American cowboys and cowgirls; they were Spanish. The opera is set in Spain. Spain has its own version of horsemen or ""cowboys"": caballeros. And their appearance in this opera does not violate the libretto or, in my opinion, the intentions of the composer.",1367280000,6,827,4.9
8482074,3,B005OV1MX4,"There is a new generation of viewers who don't have the context of the Verdi singing tradition, never heard of Tebaldi, Corelli or Del Monaco and couldn't care less about whether a singer is a spinto-shminto or not; if they sound good and look fine all is well. This review is not for them. As Sir John Falstaff puts it, ""Tutto declina"".

The booklet that comes with the Tutto Verdi box has an article by Roger Parker that discusses in its final paragraphs what may happen to Verdi's music in the next 100 years. He argues that the revival of earlier composers, particularly the flood of Handel, has brought new types of star singers, ones lacking the necessary heft for Verdi. ""...if the vogue for lighter, more flexible voices continues, then more and more Verdi operas will become virtually unperformable"". ""In a vocal world in which countertenor Philippe Jaroussky has the vogue once enjoyed by, say, tenor Franco Corelli, the writing would seem to be on the wall.""

Hallelujah! Rejoice, for this Forza, which inaugurated the 2011 season in Parma brings us a taste of that future envisaged by Mr. Parker (why was I under the impression that this future has already arrived 20 years ago?) We are truly blessed here with a cast that is matched and consistent in being miscast in roles too heavy for them. Forza is not Ballo or even Aida where you have a little more leeway as far as vocal weight. Yes, there were lyrics who stretched their resources for Forza, but the bar has never been set this low. The work is presented complete; all the cuts in the score are reopened.

Dimitra Theodossiou (making her role debut as Leonora) makes many lovely sounds, but her voice lacks the weight, body, amplitude, stamina and low notes required. She resorts to a lot of soft singing, falsetto cooing and any number of tricks, aided and abetted by these gottverfluchte body-mics. In the last few years her voice has been showing signs of  serious decline and she can barely keep a musical line, let alone legato. She is also not exactly fun to watch and her ideas of acting are borrowed from silent horror films.

Aquiles Machado (making his role debut as Don Alvaro) forces most of the time and as a result is monochromatic and lacks enough amplitude. His top is strained and the phrasing is often crude and the tone robbed of its beauty. His bright voice simply sounds wrong for Don Alvaro.

Vladimir Stoyanov fares a little better as Don Carlo di Vargas; he gives a commanding performance and gets the only mid-performance standing ovation, but the opening of the cuts in the score tax him and he tires.

Roberto Scandiuzzi sounds underpowered as Padre Guardiano and Mariana Pentcheva is another ugly-voiced Preziosilla (they often are). Carlo Lepore's Fra Melitone is the best member of the cast; his voice has body, amplitude and authority.

Maestro Gianluigi Gelmetti is entrusted with navigating this ship of fools safely to the shore. He does exactly that, providing support for the singers by making sure that the orchestra does not cover them and keeping the tempo at a comfortable pace, while keeping some sense of structure. I don't envy him; if he weren't burdened with this cast he could have conducted a great Forza just like he gave us a great Ballo (and many other first rate readings).

According to all Italian critics this production was a great success. That includes one that I know personally, and she is no fool, she is usually hard to please. Though most conceded that Machado was miscast, they usually singled out La Theodossiou for special praise, and they mostly liked the rest of the cast. They can't all be wrong.

So you wasted your time reading this negative review, because I must be wrong and the cast was not half as bad as I claim here.

But wait a second - it's true that it is very difficult to assess the singing with body-mics, but there are clips from the audience on youtube. Watch Theodossiou's ""Pace, pace mio dio"" from this production here and judge for yourself: see link 1 at the comment section below.

What is this? Is ""Pace, pace"" supposed to be all mezza voce, piano and pianissimo? Erratic dynamics masquerading as artistic expression? Vergogna! This is not a question of taste or subtle nuances - this clip shows that Theodossiou is simply incapable of singing this role. This is sad and pathetic. Yet there is no doubt she was a big success with her public. On the last performance in the run she granted requests for an encore. What was going on?

Theodossiou has a fiercely loyal fan base in Italy. They occupied mostly the stalls where much of the applause started. There were speculations on the Italian blogosphere that the loggionisti did not boo because it would have been too much work to boo almost the entire cast. There were (contested) testimonials that as soon as the curtain went down the loggionisti stood up and left. It does sound on this blu-ray like the loggionisti went on a strike - they are unusually quiet. Check this link to the final curtain calls in the penultimate performance. It's shot from gallery and at 4:00 minutes you can hear someone's dismissive reaction (in Italian) to the public's loud acclaim of Theodossiou - ""they exggerate"": see link 2 at the comment below.

You could say ""someone said, so what"" and you would be right. More research is required to clarify this issue...

I think there was something else at play: three of the six principals (including Machado and Theodossiou) were late replacements. Forza singers don't grow on trees. A few months earlier the booing made two principals leave another Parma production. Questions were raised in the press what is the point of the Verdi Festival at all. If they started booing here that could have meant the end of this expensive production and a financial loss for their beloved house, at a time when the house needed a big ""success"", at least in the press. Everyone knows their part in this game.

When I saw all the extras writhing in slow motion I had a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and checked my Thas blu-ray from Turin 2009 - yep, the same genius, Stefano Poda. There is no point trying to describe the regie - you'll either like it or hate it, just like with that Thas. I don't have a problem with the director's mishigas, I rather enjoyed it. Unlike Thas there is, alas, no nudity here. Most of the time there is some connection between the libretto and what happens on stage. The director even seems to have found a solution for the crowd scenes. This is not German regie. There is a unique blend here of imposing esthetics and a wacky, inexplicable but strangely beautiful mise-en-scene. It's like a psychotic hallucination or a bizarre nightmare.

The sound engineers used body mics as usual. Body mics are a scourge that has to go but only gets worse. My dilemma in these reviews is that I have the vague impression that most readers are just bored with discussions of this issue. More significantly, if I come out too strongly against the recordings in these series for body miking, I single them out unjustly, because this problem is now pervasive - body mics are now used in the majority of new releases (and are becoming impossible to detect) - so I held my peace.

Ma basta! ""For Zion's sake I shall not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest..."" Body mics kill any sense of ambiance, placement on stage, hall acoustic or voice projection. They sound artificial and dead, and all for what purpose? That the singers will always sound center stage and upfront? We have to come out, speak up and fight this trend!",1367107200,18,7578,4.693524096385542
