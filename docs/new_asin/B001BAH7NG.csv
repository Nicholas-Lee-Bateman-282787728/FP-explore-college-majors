8326279,5,B001BAH7NG,"I've taken Mr. Rotbart's live workshop and also purchased his video.  Both are heads-and-shoulders smarter than any other public relations course I've ever taken.  Mr. Rotbart looks at news and media relations with the eyes of a talented journalist with insider knowledge.  He designs his course to be effective -- not to fit with any PR 101 game plan.

Too many companies and agencies mistakingly think that there is an exact formula for getting good press and avoiding bad press.  Newsroom Confidential puts all such notions asunder.

I highly recommend this video to anyone who can't take the two days to attend one of the live workshops.  It is the next best thing and well worth the investment.",1214438400,,699,4.872881355932203
