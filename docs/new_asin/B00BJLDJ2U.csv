5635105,1,B00BJLDJ2U,"Please be warned that the ""Digital Copy"" on this Disney movie includes only Amazon Instant Video and Vudu.  It DOES NOT include or work with iTunes media.  It will work on an iPad, iPod, or iPhone but you are streaming the video.  If you want the typical iTunes compatible digital copy file that is included with other Disney movies, this is NOT it.  Amazon was less than helpful in their explanation.  I would suggest Amazon update the product info to state that it doesn't include an iTunes digital copy!",1377734400,5,506,4.640449438202247
5635106,4,B00BJLDJ2U,"I am normally not a fan of movies with talking animals. I know I'm overly practical but it's hard for me to get into something so unrealistic. However, with Disney's name on Super Buddies, I knew if anyone could do it well, it would be Disney.

My kids weren't really interested in watching and after seeing it, I think it's a little old for my four and five year olds. Part of it is just that it's not a cartoon but since the human characters are young teens, it would probably appeal more to a tween/teen audience. Paige did come in and out when the aliens were on screen as they were more up her alley!

I'm always amazed when watching Disney movies how skilled they are at matching voices with animals/characters. The accents and expressions fit to a `T' so you really believe these talking animals as they have evolved into something so realistic. I think in these types of movies it's really a make or break deal to get the voices right.

Super Buddies was cute and entertaining and I actually enjoyed watching it. It's good, clean family fun with a great message about working and sticking together and I think my kids will really enjoy it when they are old enough in a few years.",1377561600,18,1187,4.435779816513762
5635107,4,B00BJLDJ2U,"These dogs are so cute, but also powerful in this movie! Talk about fun the Super Buddies are actually super with super powers in this fun family movie. I love that some of the message of the movie talks about bullying and you see how the Super Buddies work together in the end to combat the bully in the movie. Each of these Super Buddies movies are simply fun, and with each one, even as my kids get older, they continue to want to see and experience the new ones and the old ones again and again. I know as an adult they seem to make me feel a bit younger, which is always a good sign! All-in-all, if you are looking for a great family friendly movie with a positive message being shared, this is definitely the one to watch!

After about 20 minutes you will want to make humanity pay for its crimes and unfortunately there's no backsies. Somewhere out there is a computer animator who had to suffer more than all of us will ever comprehend in order to pay the bills and even then it wasn't worth the time invested. Your kids will want this because look at the cute widdle puppies and their cute widdle costumes! What your kids fail to realize is that lost in the plot of magic space rings is a screenwriter begging for the sweet, sweet release of their mortal coil. The only other possibility is that somebody thought making this was a good idea and should not under any circumstances be encouraged any further. Don't do it. Don't do it for humanity.",1448064000,,815,4.513513513513513

5635141,4,B00BJLDJ2U,"Super Buddies directed by Robert Vince is a positive film about teamwork, good defeating evil, and the love you have your your family, friends, and pets.  Super Buddies is about a group of 5 dogs that help save the world. Each Buddie has a special power that they each contribute to become one big fighting force.  Buddha has the power to levitate people and objects, Mudbud can turn invisible and sneak attack people, Rosebud has super speed to retrieve objects and attack people, Budderball has super strength and can pick up people and objects, and lastly B-Dawg has stretchy power and uses it to trip people or wrap people up.
 The first positive message that was evident throughout the entire film was teamwork. We first saw the characters use teamwork to complete the scavenger hunt. Each team ran around looking for all the objects before the other teams. Rosebud and Mudbud were looking for an oval object, Mudbud ran into the hen house to get an egg but was scared off by the head hen. Rosebud then went in and grabbed the egg while Mudbud distracted the hens. This shows that the pups have a sense of strategy, which is also seen a lot in the film. Another time the pups use team work and strategy is when Mr. Swansons candy store is being robbed. The pups ran inside the store to see that Mr. Swanson was all tied up and the that intruders were stealing all the candy. All the Buddies used their powers to stop the intruders from leaving. First, Rosebud use her super speed power and took a string and tied up one of the intruders. Then Budderball used his super strength to spit super strength gum balls at the other intruder. Thirdly B-Dawg used his stretchy power to knock down the second intruder. Next Mudbud used his invisible power to run and give the first intruder a wedgie and finally Buddha dumped caramel and candy on the intruders. The pups were able to contain the intruders until Sheriff Dan got to the candy store to take them away. The Pups used teamwork to slow down the intruders and strategy by the order they attacked the intruders in. The pups weren't the only ones that used team work and strategy though. Megasis had to get the Rings of Inspiron to earth before Drex could get them. Megasis put the rings in a torpedo and shot them at earth and then shot another one into Drexs shuttle to look like he crashed. When Megasis crashed on earth he immediately dissolved his space craft so there was no evidence for Drex. Megasis then shape shifted into a dog and teamed up with Jack Schaffer and left no evidence of his existence on earth. Megasis used strategy by tricking Drex into thinking he crashed his space craft and then he used team work when he paired up with Jack Schaffer and they became Kid Courageous and Captain Canine.
 As we all know, good almost always defeats evil. In Super Buddies this is a very common theme. In many instances a good thing was always defeating or stopping an evil thing. For example, the Buddies stopped the intruders in the candy shop and saved Mr. Swanson. If the Buddies didn't stop the intruders then they could have gotten away and probably have taken all of what Mr. Swanson have and lived for. Next is an exception the to idea that good always defeats evil. Sheriff Dan put Drex in jail but Drex was able to shape shift into Sheriff Dan which allowed him to get out and be a potential threat to the outside community. When Drex got out of jail he started to ask Bartleby and his friends questions about where he could find the Rings of Inspiron. Bartleby and his friends thought he was Sheriff Dan so they of course told him and then Drex went and caused havoc. Another time that good defeated evil was when Capitan Canine took out Drex in the pig pen but of course Drex didn't let up. He took out Capitan Canine and thought he defeated the good. But no, the Super Buddies aren't going to let him off that easy. First Buddha levitates Drex into a hay pile but Drex still doesnt give up. B-Dawg then gets Drex to zap him but he cant because B-Dawg is stretchy and made of rubber and rubber cant conduct electricity. Then Drex starts to throw garden tools at the Buddies but Rosebud uses her super speed to run around the rest of the Buddies and reflect the tools back at Drex and pin him to the wall of the barn. Next Budderball and Drex run at each other and head butt teacher other and Budderball knocks Drex out. Next, Drex lifts up a tractor and drops it on the pups but Mudbud turned them all invisible and they escaped unharmed. Finally evil Drex is finally defeated when Bartleby gives Drex the plastic rings that came in then dog food instead of the real rings. Drew left and then realized he had the fake rings and crashed into an asteroid. As explain above good always does defeat evil, it may not happen right away but a string of events will lead to the outcome.
 Your love for your family, friends, and pets always has a positive message behind it. In Super Buddies every character was looking out for each other. At the beginning of the film we see each Buddie come with their owners. Every time the pups and their owners were together you would witness a display of affection for each other. For example, when the puppies came back from destroying Drex all the owners ran and were happy that their pups were ok. Also the pups ran to their owners. Their is also a lot of affection towards family members. In the beginning of the film Gramps is seen making breakfast for Bartleby because it is his birthday. Gramps then gives Bartleby a comic book that is very rare and this is where the story begins. Not every Grandpa will take you under his wing and treat you like he treated his own children. Later on in the movie Captain Canine tries to defeat Drex but is hurt in the effort. Jack Schaffer, Kid Courageous, rushes over just to see that Captain Canine is unresponsive. All the Buddies gather around Captain Canine and use the Rings of Inspiron to heal Capitain Canine so he could turn back into Megasis and ring the rings safely back to planet Inspiron.
 In conclusion, a super hero movie doesnt always have to be packed with action. As shown by all the Super Buddies you don't have to be human to make an impact on the world. Sometimes a little positivity is all you need to save the day.",1446508800,2,6283,4.459130434782609

5635199,1,B00BJLDJ2U,"Super Buddies (Robert Vince, 2013)

Five dogs discover alien rings that give them super powers, after which they run around bumbling their way to saving people (and pets). Which would be your basic stupid kidflick (and even if it were, why would you waste your time on this crap when there are so many better kidflicks out there?) were it not for the personalities of the pups in question, based on the characters of the owner of each, including a prepubescent (white) jive-talker, a spoiled princess, a bully, and a nerd, all stereotypes with the depth of a sheet of onionskin, if even that. Ten minutes into this I was ready to tear my hair out; after eighty I was considering canceling my Netflix Streaming subscription just so this monstrosity would be out of my Recently Viewed queue and the Bean would forget about its existence. Absolutely horrifying. I found it offensive because of the stereotyping (and how it is used not even to address any issues, but just to distinguish the charactersthe laziest possible use of stereotyping); YMMV, but I kind of hope it doesn't, because if you find it acceptable, yes, I will probably judge you for that.

I enjoyed Spookybuddies but I felt they could have done a bit more. Treasurebuddies was a complete disappointment, so I expected better of this.

At first I was excited to see it, but before the DVD was released, I found out a lady's horse was injured during filming this movie. The lady received no apology from Disney or Robert Vince. The horse's injury caused him to be lame for weeks to come, and Disney and Robert Vince even tried lying saying the horse was always lame. This alone makes me want to give this movie 1 star.

I did not buy this movie but feel if an animal was injured in it, then they don't deserve the 20 dollars from me to purchase it. It does make me wonder though...if they say the on end credits ""No animals were harmed in the making of this film"" because animals were harmed.

Making Superbuddies sacrificed an innocent ranch horse...anyone who buys it doesn't realize they just paid for a movie where an animal was injured. DON""T buy this! Don't give Disney the money for this movie!",1384041600,,1196,4.523148148148148

The story line is perhaps a little more complicated than the previous in the series. Each Buddie gets a magic ring from space travelers and acquires superpowers. The special effects are outstanding. This is my favorite of the series. If you like the others, you'll like this too.",1378080000,,435,4.662337662337662

It had too much about Drexel, the bad guy.  Maybe boys who like aliens would like it better.  The part I liked was when Captain Megasus taught the Buddies their powers.  I hope the next Buddies movie is better!",1377820800,7,388,4.2465753424657535

I  know  this  is  mostly  a  kids  movie,  I  figured  since  I  love  dogs  I  might  as  well  check  this  out.
In  this  movie  Budderball's  owner  is  collecting  rings  &  comic  books.  The  rings  the  buddies  find  gives  each  one  of  them  their  own  powers,  which  they  eventually  use  to  stop  a  few  crimes  that  take  place,  then  must  return  to  an  alien  whom  they  originally  belong  to  who  has  taken  the  shape  of  a  dog  which  he  mistaked  for  a  human  in  the  beginning  of  the  movie.  Him  &  his  human  companion  he  partnered  up  with  know  as  Captain  America  or  whatever  his  name  was  had  become  famous  for  writing  comic  books.
They  actually  managed  to  find  a  girl  puppy  for  Rosebud's  character  this  time.
&  that's  the  first  time  that  I  know  of.",1507075200,,881,4.290780141843972
