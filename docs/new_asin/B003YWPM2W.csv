Loved the shows far better than current crap on free to air TV

8409818,1,B003YWPM2W,"....doesn't hold up well over time.  This is one of those things.  The Buccaneers, William Tell, and especially Sir Lancelot come off as incredibly lame.  Even Robin Hood didn't hold up very well.  The film quality is abysmal and, while as kids we were glued to the TV when these shows were on, as an adult I couldn't sit through a whole show of any of them.  You'd be better off to get full length movies on these subjects rather than try taking a trip down memory lane.  For this set, it's a dead-end.  Don't waste your money.",1361404800,2,528,4.326530612244898

Nice tin box",1360368000,,116,4.571428571428571
