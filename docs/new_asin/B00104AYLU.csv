James J. Jeffries, who appears in this 1932 Poverty Row programmer as ring referee, won the world heavyweight crown in 1899 by defeating titleholder Bob Fitzsimmons. He retired undefeated six years later, unretired in 1910 and challenged reigning champ Jack Johnson as a ""Great White Hope"" in Tex Rickard's famous ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-of-the-Century/dp/B000EWBNPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight of the Century</a>."" Jeffries' corner threw in the towel in the 15th round.

Jeffries at 57 is paunchy, bald and devoid of once magnificent muscles. He must've been in pain watching two scrawny actors flailing away at each other in the ring. Fight sequences here are obviously undercranked; that extra speed makes them all the more laughable.
