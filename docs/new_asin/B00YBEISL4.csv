8718133,5,B00YBEISL4,"I love this movie! It is one hilarious spoof on the Star Wars movies IV-VI. This edition is basically the same in ""content"" as the 25th Anniversary Edition, however, if you want a really nice looking steelbook to compliment your other ones you may have, I recommend this one. It is very nicely done with a ""scene"" from the movie on the inside covering both sides. Quite similar to the ones of I-VI that just came out in the SW saga. I love the artwork on it as well. Not only do you get the Blu-ray movie, but you get the Digital HD and a few surprises inside the package.
~ 7 mini lobby cards, 5 in color, 2 in black and white.
~ 6 mini bumper stickers you can use anywhere ~
* I LOVE BARF.
* MAY THE SCHWARTZ BE WITH YOU.
* WE BRAKE FOR NOBODY.
* I (heart symbol) URANUS.
* EVIL WILL ALWAYS TRIUMPH, BECAUSE GOOD IS DUMB.
* SPACEBALLS - THE BUMPER STICKER.
Special Features are the same in content as the 25th Edition on the disc itself.
Please look around your local retailers, you may get a good deal on this one.",1453680000,6,1017,4.115577889447236
8718134,1,B00YBEISL4,"MGM are reissuing spaceballs again on blu-ray this time as 28th Anniversary blu-ray in Steelbook packaging
there's no new special features, it's just a recycle of the 25th anniversary release
infact this 28th Anniversary edition has exactly the same content as the 25th Anniversary edition
all the special features, and i mean all of the extras have been carried over to this new 28th anniversary edition
and so has the HD transfer, there's no new transfer it's the same as the 25th
the only Difference is the packaging is steelbook version with Different cover art, that's all it is
so if you have the 25th Anniversary blu-ray, no need to buy this new 28th edition, it's a waste of money
5 stars for the film of course
1 star for this new 28th Anniversary edition, it's just steelbook version with Different cover art that's all",1446854400,2,829,4.724137931034483
