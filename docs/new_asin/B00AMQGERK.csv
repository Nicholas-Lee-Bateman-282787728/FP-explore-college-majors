8553878,3,B00AMQGERK,"I'm a Bronson fan old enough to have seen Dirty Dozen in a first run theater, but I had avoided much of his late career work. I figured the only crossover member of both The Magnificent 7 and The Dirty Dozen, the man who faced off with an evil Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West, deserved better than a string of sleazy cheapies from Cannon Films. When I finally saw Murphy's Law and 10 to Midnight, I realized that, while far from his best work, they were both effective entertainments. Then I saw CaboBlanco and The Evil That Men Do and realized that I'll watch Bronson in almost anything.

Which brings me to these two films.

Assassination might actually have been something, given it's pedigree. Author Richard Sale had written the flamboyantly eccentric script for Bronson's White Buffalo ten years earlier, and long before that, had created the enjoyable TV series Yancy Derringer. And director Peter Hunt had made the well-regarded, large-scale Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. But judging by this one, you might guess that neither one had made a movie before. Or maybe seen one. Nothing's credible. Characters are sketches. Pacing is rushed to the point where nothing carries any weight, it's all just skimmed over. When a bad guy runs into someone's barn, Bronson picks up a rocket launcher and blows the building to pieces. He misses the bad guy but destroys some hapless citizen's building and whoever else might have been inside, and not a word is said about it. This one isn't sleazy, it's just stupid and poorly made.

For sleazy, we now turn to Kinjite. As deliberately provocative as Assassination is innocuous, it takes an unpleasant look at how different cultures deal with relationships. Specifically, between adult male perverts and young females. Bronson is quite believable in one of his better late-period parts. Protective father and out-of-control cop. Good to see a still lovely Peggy Lipton from Mod Squad as his patient wife. This is 80's exploitation fare with something on its mind and, while still formulaic, it feels strangely ambitious.

Each film is on its own one-sided disc, with a good picture and no extras. Not up to Bronson's 60's or even 70's work, but worth owning anyway if you like Bronson.",1398124800,,2254,4.846753246753247
