8452096,4,B0050Z4CY0,"This movie is found under the title ""Tops is the limit"" only on VHS until now. The storyline is of course off the mark but that was the way such films were made. I.e. NO one gets naked. The Scene with Merman and Crosby over his treating her like a lady and leading her on is priceless. The music is amazing but the Merman rendition of 'I get a kick out of you' is just priceless. Like everyone else, I wish there was a better copy of digital but not at this time.",1513036800,,463,3.989247311827957
8452097,4,B0050Z4CY0,"I'm in full agreement with the other reviewers, the print is below par. Nonetheless, if this is all there is, and one can get it inexpensively (no price is given right now), it is worth seeing. True, the comedy sags; true, there is little of the Cole Porter Broadway score; true, Crosby is still learning how to act in films (or anywhere else, for that matter) but....a big but....there is Ethel Merman singing what is left of Porter...and there is that incomparable Crosby voice and style in several numbers, one of them familiar to any Crosby follower of a certain age. For younger viewers, a chance to see these two stars, who were in process of becoming Queen and King, respectively, of Broadway and Hollywood musicals should not be missed.",1440720000,,744,4.730769230769231
8452098,2,B0050Z4CY0,"Apart from the poor quality of the print, which one can tune out, the movie contains virtually none of the original show's songs and, to add insult to injury, employs Ethel Merman, who triumphed in the original production of the stage show, not to sing them (she does sing 'I get a Kick Out of You')  Obviously the ways of Hollywood were as bizarre then (in the 30's) as they are now.",1355356800,2,384,4.333333333333333
8452099,2,B0050Z4CY0,"It is a pity that this really poor print of the 1936 film of Paramount's ""Anything Goes"" is the only available.  Paramount's vaults seems to have the very best unrestored prints of any of the studio products so this DVD clearly has not been obtained from that source.

The film is a ""version"" of the famous Cole Porter stage production with Ethel Merman repeating her Broadway role. The story has been altered and watered down but there is a fine cast of amusing Paramount players such as Charlie Ruggles and Arthur Treacher who are always worth seeing. The farce is almost screwball and very entertaining. Bing Crosby takes the lead and sings with real zest.  He and Merman duet ""You're the Top"" memorably. The orchestrations are charming and a few of the songs have delightful choruses giving lush accompaniment to the leads. Ida Lupino plays the ingenue and the part is pathetic. She looks cute as a blonde but there is a dry quality to her romancing which foreshadows the intense star which emerged in the forties.  She is not suited to such frivolous stuff and she knew it.

If the film really interests you, it might be worth waiting for a better print.",1343174400,2,1159,4.661764705882353
8452100,2,B0050Z4CY0,"The technical quality has been discussed by others.  I will focus on the content.  This is not the lovely, witty musical by Cole Porter.  This is more of a romantic comedy with occasional songs sung by Bing Crosby.  Its key benefit is that it mostly follows the plot of the stage musical (unlike the 1956 film which tosses out the original plot), but it leaves out many songs and brings in songs by others.  What is worse is that the person who originated the role of Reno Sweeney on stage stars in this film.  Ethyl Merman's renditions of the Cole Porter songs she is allowed to sing give a faint hint of what the show was like and what this movie might have been had the director trusted the original material.",1323388800,,712,4.396946564885496
8452101,2,B0050Z4CY0,"This is an old classic, and worth seeing, but this DVD is just a blurry copy of a VHS tape that someone transferred. You can even see the SP and the display time at the beginning of the movie. If Amazon is going to sell a DVD, it should sell a DVD, not a bad copy made by some little mom and pop operation.",1314403200,8,306,3.796875
8452102,1,B0050Z4CY0,"The version of Anything Goes 1936 sold by ""Loving The Classics"" (LTC) was made from a video tape.
The video tape recorder ""PLAY""  text overlay is present in the first frames of the film and the quality of the video image is poor - not very poor - but almost.
It would seem that someone recorded this off of the TV, then created a DVD to sell on Amazon.
It's too bad that this is the only version of this classic film that is available on Amazon.",1313366400,6,445,4.114942528735632
8452103,3,B0050Z4CY0,"Reason I bought this was I love Cole Porter music and figured this was the earliest and truest version of this musical to be found. Also wondered if Ethel Merman ever just sang and not yelled. Well she does sing here and yet it is still her unique voice. This is a recording of a film over 70 years old so the quality is poor, like watching a movie underwater. BUT if you are into old films, like Bing and Ethel just sit twice as far back from your TV as usual, then  this DVD can be fun.",1309046400,13,488,3.979591836734694
