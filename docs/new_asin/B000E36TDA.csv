8130107,2,B000E36TDA,"I felt like I was watching ""the real world"" from MTV. The film is more about the riders than kitesurfing really. I'd say 90% drinking and partying and talking about themselves, 10% riding. Which is a real shame because the kiteboarding parts are amazing. When they get on the water, they definitely knock your socks off. Really beautiful photography, including underwater footage of them swimming (!). I reckon they didn't have enough riding footage to fill the hour so they just shot themselves hanging out. Not exactly what I was expecting from ""A kiteboarding experience"". Would be okay as a rental but I'm not sure it's worth a buy.",1159142400,2,636,4.844036697247707
8130108,5,B000E36TDA,The close-up cinematography with watery blue hues paired with natural wind and water sounds allowed me to feel as if I were on site with the crew. Not only do you experience this awesome extreme sport up close but you get to meet the athletes and learn why kiting inspires them. Go ahead and take a short vacation on the coast by enjoying this DVD!,1158883200,,348,4.369230769230769
