8279439,5,B001AS94XU,So bummed I missed original airings- but good to add to the collection: Anime like styling (even more so compares to animated Clone Wars seasons). 3min Short format segments rolled into fast paced action. Interesting stories to build up to Episode III. A rare find- but a must have for a true Star Wars fan.,1424563200,,307,4.6
8279440,5,B001AS94XU,I would recommend this product for any child interested.  My daughter has really enjoyed the challenge  of each volume 1 &  2,1393891200,,125,4.590909090909091
8279441,3,B001AS94XU,"If you are here I do not need to tell you how great Tartakovsky's Clone Wars is. Nor that we all daydream with the rumor that he pitched another one with Han Solo and Chewbacca and was never greenlighted.

That being said, Here's something I didn't liked after purchasing this product: I really loved the format of mini episodes the show had. However, this DVDs have all of them pieced together like a movie and not as they were aired in Cartoon Network.
I really loved the small run time they had and how each one teased you and left you wanting to watch the next one. It's not the same thing if you look at them as a complete movie. Wanted to see one of them each night I came from work btw, now I cannot do it :)",1393632000,,715,4.107142857142857
8279442,5,B001AS94XU,"First of all, this is very, very different from the Star Wars: Clone Wars CGI show currently running on Cartoon Network. Tartakovsky's Clone Wars uses 2D animation, as opposed to the current show's 3D CGI. The episodes are actually a series of shorts (micro-episodes) intended to tell what happened right after AOTC and right before ROTS.

I like both versions of the Clone Wars. However, I think the visual imagery in the Tartakovsky version is more interesting. There are some really interesting and memorable creature designs, such as Yoda's Kybuck. I love that the show uses familiar alien species for new Jedi, such as the Ithorian Roron Corobb, Talz Foul Modama, Wolfman Volviff Monn, and Whiphid K'Kruhk. Visually, they're far more memorable than any of the characters from the newer Clone Wars.

I also like that General Grievous isn't a pansy in this series. He's absolutely brutal. I found Grievous in ROTS to be more annoying than anything else, and even in the current Clone Wars find him merely tolerable. However, his introduction at the end of Volume 1 is absolutely chilling.

Unfortunately, because of time constraints, the Tartakovsky version obviously doesn't delve into character development or intricate story plots. On those aspects, I think the current Clone Wars excels. Volume 2 of the Tartakovsky series does tell the story of how Palpatine was kidnapped, but even that is more a prolonged action sequence than a rich story.

Overall, if you're a Star Wars fan, the Tartakovsky is definitely worth tracking down. I found both volumes used in great condition for around $20, so it's possible to get a deal. More than anything else, some of the new background characters and images are truly iconic.",1353888000,2,1723,5.035087719298246
8279443,5,B001AS94XU,"With episodes (which were originally presented in 5 minutes or less) now connected without advertising or interruption, this is almost TOO much excitement!  This viewer found himself suffering overload after about 45 minutes of watching volume One.  Extremely satisfying, to say the least!",1342051200,2,289,5.6976744186046515
