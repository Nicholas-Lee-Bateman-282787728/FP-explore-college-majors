8143305,1,B000I2J6X2,"Heavily cut International version of the Jimmy Wang Yu Taiwanese film The Beheaded 1,000. Original version clocks in at about 125 minutes; The Executioner title runs at 105, omitting over 20 minutes of footage! It's a cheap DVD, but worthless in content. No current DVDs exist of the original version, but fan copies exist of the Thai VCD on the internet if you know where to look.",1408752000,2,381,4.701492537313433
8143306,1,B000I2J6X2,Was not the movie I was looking for. Didn't much care for the film. I found it slow and the martial arts were a let down.,1354924800,,121,3.6923076923076925
