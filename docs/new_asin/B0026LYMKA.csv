3854319,4,B0026LYMKA,"Although it is rated yuri, it's more shoujo-ai (A mild version of yuri) but that doesn't take away from how utterly cute this series is.

The story begins with Aoi Nagisa transferring to an all girls school and meeting the elusive and beautiful Hanazono Shizuma, the Etoile of the school. It starts to introduce more characters and not just one but a few love triangles begin to form. The 100% girl cast keeps you in the moment of this and they are portrayed realistically than most yuri animes.

For fans of yuri, I would consider this a good buy.",1262995200,,548,4.525252525252525
3854320,5,B0026LYMKA,"The whole birth of Strawberry panic was a spoof of Maria Watches over Us. They took the subtle yuri in Maria and increased it ten fold. It's not subtle yuri. Girls kiss girls and like it. The manga was more of the spoof.

The anime on the other hand is a dramatic wonderful story that I do indeed love. Strawberry panic I've heard much like Simoun people either like it or don't. I do.

It's about Nagisa transferring to this campus that not only has one all girls school but has three of them and they share one gigantic dorm (the name strawberry panic I believe comes from the fact the dorm is triangular in layout and has a red roof). Upon her very first few moments at school happens to bump into Shizuma who in their first meeting almost kisses her (we do not know if she does or not cuz Nagisa blacks out).

The first half is driven by Nagisa's wanting to learn more about this mysterious woman and the second half is driven by her coming to terms with what has happened.

There is character growth and tons of yuri fluff.

If you want yuri fluff this is an anime for you.

Now much like Simoun Media blasters (anime works is a subdivision of them) packed all 5 dvds into ONE regular sized dvd case. I will say what I said in my Simoun review. I'm disappointed in the design of the box set. There is something to be had with having a nice looking thinpack (with all the original coverart in the slimcases) then this.

But we don't buy the anime for the cases, we buy it for the anime so if you haven't picked up any of Strawberry Panic yet this box set is a cheap way to get the entire series.",1260316800,7,1599,4.188925081433225
3854321,5,B0026LYMKA,"Yuri by my definition is the relationship between females whether sexual or not.  Strawberry Panic is One of the best Yuris around.  An exciting story that will have you laughing and crying through the events that surround Nagisa, Shizuma, and friends as they go through high school.  For ANYONE browsing for something to watch I Highly recommend this series.  Don't just simply watch this series, feel it.  Let your emotions follow along, I promise you, you will not regret it.",1254441600,5,478,4.925
3854322,4,B0026LYMKA,"I own all the available anime, manga, and lite novels for this series.  If you're like me, you will enjoy many sweet moments and be left wanting more.

For flaws:  There are some awkward transitions; there are story threads that should have seen greater development; and this is a series that ends too soon because these young girls are characters you want to know more about.  There are even parts that some may think bear a (too) strong similarity to other anime story plots, but I'll call it homage.

Bottom line:  The joys and angst of girls in love is dealt with in a natural and direct way that includes the bitter with the sweet and the shy with the bold.  This is a story of charming young school girls in their first (second, third?) blush of love and shares their desire to connect as friends and as more-than-friends.  It was a pleasure that ended too soon.",1254009600,3,868,4.484076433121019
3854323,5,B0026LYMKA,"For all those who find the subtle hints at lesbianism in such shows as Revolutionary Girl Utena and Maria Watches Over Us annoyingly vague, look no further.  Strawberry Panic pulls no punches, calling a spade a spade... without ever once using the word or being judgemental.  Essentially a high school romance, or rather a set of them, SP takes place at three linked all-girl's academies that share a common dorm.  With casual aplomb, the show deals with all aspects of high-school dating: jealousy, love triangles, shyness, and inevitable seperation.  The characters are well designed, rich with nuance, and - if lacking in depth and background at times - engaging as all get out.  While essentially character driven, this show does have more of a coherent plot and story arc than Marmite... plus each of the three schools has its own set of uniforms, all of them significantly more attractive than those found in Marmite or Utena.",1248048000,21,932,4.948717948717949

The anime follows the relationship these two begin to share. It definitely has a yuri plot and doesnt tip toe around the fact that they are two girls falling in love.

8353065,5,B0026LYMKA,"I'll start off by saying that this anime is so sweet that it might seriously give some people a toothache.

Its ridiculously cute!!! I personally had trouble controlling my inner fanboy! So the major warnings here: If you're not into Yuri, and you don't really like really really really sweet/cute anime then this one is DEFINATELY not for you.

That being said if you do like sweet adorable yuri then add this to your collection immediately, This was Japanese with english subtitles only when I purchased it and honestly I don't know if I would ask for an english version it would most likely just cheapen it and make it unwatchable unless it was dubbed extremely well.

I honestly struggle to put my thoughts on this one out there without just outright gushing, its like a spoonful of sugar served by a group of super adorable anime girls. If that sounds like your flavor of tea then please get this its a wonderful series. Just try not to overindulge because it is extremely sweet!",1305244800,,984,4.64367816091954
8353066,4,B0026LYMKA,"Ah Strawberry Panic. What an odd anime it really is.
First off, I will attempt to do this with as little spoilers as I can, but just in case....You've been warned.

Now then lets us start with the premise shall we. Strawberry Panic is about a girl named Aoi Nagisa who has transferred to an all girls school. The school is located on a place called Astrea Hill, which also houses two other all girls schools.

Who thought it would be a good idea to put three all girls schools on an isolated hill? Well this was not explained in the anime version, so I will shed some light on it for all of you, for confusions sake. The hill was origiall home to a school for training Nuns, and the only people allowed on the property were the Nuns and there students(Daughters). Over time two other schools were built and the place became a place for girls. Of course it still kept some of it's religious themes in it, but more of that later on.

Back to the premise. Nagisa is transferring into her fourth year(first ear of high school, but the schools also host junior high, so technically her fourth year.) because her parents moved over seas. There she meets and befriends her new roommate Suzumi Tomao, who has feelings for her. However, Nagisa also meets the mysterious and Famed Hananzono Shizuma, who happens to be the etoile(the representative of the three schools, and the most honored student on campus). All would be fine, however, Shizuma has a certain history which she's infamous for, and Nagisa is her next target. The three go to the school Saint Miator

That alone would be a good enough plot right? Apparently not, because in the third episode we get a second plot. This one fallows Konohana Hikari. A third year transfer student at the school Saint Spica. Hikary is on the school's quire with her room mate Nanto Yaya, who has feelings for her. Hikary is enchanted by the school's top student Otori Amame, a star athlete popular for being skilled at riding her white horse, she is masculine in appearance and is nicknamed ""Spica's Prince"". Hikary is in love with Amane, but can't find a way to be noticed by her.

All of these girls live in a dormitory called the ""Strawberry Dorms"", hence the name ""Strawberry Panic""

Now then, that's the plot in as basic as I can put it, with no spoilers what so ever. Now lets talk about the setting and art style.

The show has a beautiful scenery that shows grassy hills, nicely lit woods, tastefully done snow, and a beautifully done lake that shadows a nicely drawn chapel. Each of the schools look completely different and give off a good contrast. We get Maitor with its old fashion Gothic style, Spica with a bright and majestic style that shows wealth, and Lilum with a modern day boarding school style. You certainly won't mix any of the three school's students up, since they each have their own unique uniforms that look nothing alike. Inside the schools you get several different things to look at with the scenery. They definitely gave us no expense with the over all look of the show.

Now then, the second most important part. The characters.

Nagisa plays off as your typical air head. Most of the time she is unaware of what's going on, and is easily tempted by food. She has a cute personality that you can get used to very fast. Of course at time she is just ""too dumb"", like in the fist episode as well as the filler episodes. Though she starts off as a simple minded air head, one of the highlights this show has to offer is to see her mature. Even if it takes 26 episodes. She's simple, but definitely a good fit for the main character.

Tomao on the other hand is just plain psycho. Many people will say she's one of the best characters in the show, but to be honest, she's just insane. I wish I could g into detail, but that would mean spoiling way to much. However I will say that one of the obvious hints at her insanity involves Nagisa and a tape recorder. To be fair to her, the back story we are given(again can't tell) makesup for about 25% of her insanity, but not nearly enough on the whole part.

Shizuma is by far the most interesting character in the series. She puts off a cool aura that makes you just want more. For the first half of the show, she is a person of mystery who is so unpredictable that you just want to get insider her head and learn more and more about her. Of course when you do learn about her, it's just as satisfying. However, I would be lying if I didn't say that she isn't a ""you know what"" sometimes. She plays as off a very cruel and heartless character through a big part of the series, and this is certainly one thing that makes people hate her. However, it's her cold side that makes you more interested in her. You know that she is honored and praised by all, but you don't know why. So you want to keep watching so you can see the hidden part of Shizuma that makes her the way she is.

Chiyo is Nagisa and Tomao's first year maid(all first year students are allowed to be ""helpers"" to older students) She is honestly as pointless as it gets. She has no redeeming factors and no significance to the story at all. She's just there to be cute and brainless. Next character.

Rokujo Miyuki is the student council president at Miator, and Shizuma's long term friend. To be honest, her only real point is to reveal things about Shizuma from time to time, nag Shizuma, and show just how dumb Nagisa can really be. Yet her significant to the story is not to be over looked.

Hikary's only true reason to be in the series is to raped. I'm not joking, she is raped in almost every episode she appears in(not actually raped, she gets saved every time). She is almost like a last minute character, she doesn't even appear until the third episode. In which they had to get rid of Nagisa and her cast just to get the basics revealed. Granted she is smarter than Nagisa, she's also more sensitive than Nagisa.

Yaya is only really there to be happy or emo. Her character only actually does something when it involves Hikary being raped, or her being sad. In all seriousness, she only has two emotions. Happy and sad.

Amane is.....ok. Unlike the other two main characters from Spica, she actually has a brain. Her side of the story is a complicated one about pressure and desire. She has her moments where she's actually interesting, but that's only every now and then.

Tsubomi is even more worthless than Chiyo. She's just there to be a tsundere with absolutely no Derere.

The other Spica students cannot be added due to their massive plot significance on the Spica side. Just know that they try to get Amane to want to be etoile, and the are responsible for all but one of Hikary's rapes.

Hey, I bet you forgot that there was a third school. Well that's because that school serves no purpose at all except to give this story more comic relief. Unlike the manga where the are part of a secret plot(that never gets revealed because the manga got canceled) they do nothing throughout the entire show....and I mean NOTHING.

The only character with some significance is Minamoto Chikaru, president of Lilum. She basically does nothing but talk and make her fellow students(the three are so pointless I won't even bother) where cosplay. She is important because of a play that happens in the middle of the series. That is it.

Now for the over all plot.
To be honest, the first 16 episodes are mostly slice of life and have a very small lot. Imagine a really long character introduction, that is the first 16 episodes. From episode 17 to the end however has a pretty good plot. Though I cannot spoil it for you. All the love, the arguments, and competition makes for a fine watch. You'll definitely like the ending episodes.....if you aren't completely bored by the first half of the series and lose all interest.

To be honest, a lot of the love seems forced. Most of it can even seem more like rape then love. However if you think the love is forced, than you should see the fan service. After episode 12 the show takes another direction and gives us a bunch of fan service, too much if you ask me. In a show about lesbians, the last thing I want is to be attracted to them. After all it's 100% impossible to be with them already, making them lesbians just adds on to that.

A perfect example of a forced love is the Hikary/Amane relationship. The two have no true emotion towards each other at all. Also, we aren't even given a reason as to why they should become a couple.

I also need to complain about the first kiss in the series(not gonna say who share it. The couple falls into a pool. They stare at each other before kissing. Though it's beautifully animated, it still comes off as a pointless scene. If you were to fall into a swimming pool, would you kiss somebody before coming up for air? I consider that scene just dumb.

So now then. What do I think about this mostly plotless story with several pointless moments,needless fan service,and a second storyline that doesn't serve a big purpose until the end?(Seriously, they don't fit Hikary's story into the main one, they take breaks and give her five full episode that have little to no other characters, just because they didn't have enough event to fit into the main plot. Yet she suddenly becomes important at the climax.)

In my honest opinion. I love this show. Strawberry Panic is one of my favorite anime of all time. All the filler episodes are very enjoyable, the animation and artwork are always pleasant to look at, the plot is beautiful and can have you in tears by the end, and all of the characters(with points to them) give off great personalities that really give you a big variety.

My biggest problem with this show is that the ended it too well. I really want to know what happens with these characters at the end, the ending is very open. So anything could happen. That's what makes me the maddest, they end it too well.

If I was acting my own opinions, I would tell you it's perfect and yo must buy it. However, I am trying to be unbiased, so I had to tear apart such a wonderful series.

If you like laughs, sad moments, and a wonderful romance. Then this is your anime.......Oh and if you don't already know, this is a Yuri. So expect lesbians. There is also not one male in this entire series",1292284800,3,10276,4.445270988310308
8353067,2,B0026LYMKA,"Lesbian interested fans only really apply here, the rest may find this drags quite a bit. This one of the only anime I have watched where it was so boring I actually stopped. Initially it looked interesting, and I thought I might even find the gay women thing interesting, like Nana, but this is just uninspired and gets old real fast. The character set up is cool and at first you think it might be good, but oh boy... yeesh, really dry, but I did like the visual character of this one head school girl with big gray hair. The end credits have live action girls dancing like embarrassed zombies, and live footage in anime always detracts from the experience.",1291593600,2,659,4.5
