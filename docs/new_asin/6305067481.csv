7883207,4,6305067481,This was a great wartime comedy. William Bendix and dennis o'keefe were as funny together in this movie as Abbott & Costello. A bunch of guys in marine uniforms vying for the affections of an Aussie girl played by Helen Walker. I felt like the Farrelly Brothers might have got some of their ideas from watching this. A lot of similarities to 'Something about Mary'.,1347580800,,365,4.630769230769231
