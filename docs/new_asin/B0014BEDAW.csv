Jill Scott being the only exception. She is it!",1215475200,3,189,3.871794871794872
3128045,5,B0014BEDAW,"There were extra tracks I was not expecting.  I thought the DVD was going to a visual version of the CD, it was that and more",1214870400,,125,3.8076923076923075
3128046,2,B0014BEDAW,"I suppose if you a fan this DVD would just be too awsome NOT to have in your collection but unfortunately Mr. Legend does NOT do it for me. A brilliant artist but not the line of music that interest me. I find his voice to be very monotonous and barely half way throught the show i started yawning.

Unfortunely he will NOT get the vote from me though but for all the RnB lovers out there be sure NOT to miss out on this one.

Corinne Bailey Rae what a beautiful voice .... be sure to watch out for some thrilling music from her in years to come....",1214092800,,549,4.027522935779817

3128058,3,B0014BEDAW,Its OK! Its John Legend. You saw another side of him. I am hoping to find a really nice concert DVD. Hopefully at his performance in TT Jazz Festival 2014.,1386892800,,155,4.2

3128060,5,B0014BEDAW,watched it on netflix. Steve Gadd (Stuff) !!!!! thats all i have to say!!! Paul Simon!!!! the voice is flawless. Music fans that appreciate it's beauty and history will love this feature! Just listening is satisfying enough! Richard Tee and Eric Gale also from Stuff!!!! and Tony Levin (King Crimson) on bass!

3128062,5,B0014BEDAW,Time and money prevent me from attending concerts any more.  I'm forced to fill the void with concert DVD/BR discs and this one is GREAT!

3128063,5,B0014BEDAW,My gf loved this dvd. It's a great list of some of his best music and a cool insight into the man himself as a person and as a musician. Great for any fans of John Legend.,1297900800,,171,3.6486486486486487
3128064,1,B0014BEDAW,"Thanks to the other reviewers for exposing this re-packaged rip-off.  I was wondering if this was another show video taped around the same time as the ""Live at the Tower Theater"" show.  Glad to find out before buying that this is actually THE SAME DVD WITH A DIFFERENT TITLE.

3128067,5,B0014BEDAW,"If you are a John Legend fan or just want something to sit back and chill with, this concert is for you.  He sings songs from his first & second CDs but the live band only makes it sound much better. It's a nice add to your collection.

DVD extras also a nice touch.

8254878,5,B0014BEDAW,"Not that it's the best concert, by any means. Paul is not in great voice, the horn section in the back up band sometimes sounds like the pit orchestra from the local high school musical and the audio is dated to the original time period. But, from a nostalgic point of view, it's excellent. This was one of my first LaserDisc purchases (actually I think it came free with my Pioneer purchase) so it takes me back to a simpler time.
