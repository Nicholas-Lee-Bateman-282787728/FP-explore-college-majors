617175,5,6303257348,"It may not display the the scenic effulgence of red painted buttes beneath a cereulian sky, as with the Searchers, or the impregnable fortress backdrop of the tetons,as with Shane, but its psychological intensity, deep character studies, and indefatigable suspense,makes 3:10 to Yuma just as praise-worthy as the former two. The austere black and white gives the film its dream-like ambiance (along with the strumming of morose guitar chordings in the background). The seemingly deserted town of contention brings a macabre feeling over the viewer,all the while the viewer builds an adrenaline rush(like one i have not even experienced with many modern thrillers.)At certain junctures of the film Daves directs the camera anglings so masterfully that the scenes are indelibly etched in the viewers mind(look for the scene in the hotel room where Ben Wade(ford)taunts and bribes Dan Evans (Van Heflin) the camera zooms in closer and closer to Evans anger contorted face.)This is a very unique western that stands out in the pletheora of oaters being produced in the 50s. Though it has been overlooked by serious western film critics (Who devote more time to the other classics of that decade: Shane,High Noon, The Searchers,Rio Bravo, and the Anthony Mann/Jimmy Stewart selections) 3:10 to Yuma deserves a closer look. Its sheer intensity and noir psychology exalt it,and i'am confident other viewers would concur, to a status worthy of one of the top ten in the genre. For me it is indubitably in the top four or five of the greatest westerns of all time. Pick this one up! Incredible!!!",1029369600,11,1587,5.107692307692307
617176,4,6303257348,"'3:10 To Yuma' is a stark monochrome Western that has been praised for its suspense and high moral tone.  Van Heflin, in a darker variant on his role in 'Shane', plays a character who picks up where most Westerns leave off.  The genre is usually concerned with taming wild loners or men with pasts. rewarding them with the joys of civilisation.  Heflin has seen what civilisation really means.  He lives on a drought-dry farm with a wife and two children he often fails to feed.  The grind of fruitless labour has worn them all down, and Heflin's identity as a man, having been once the greatest shot in these parts, is now undermined by humiliation in front of his family by outlaws stealing his cattle and horses, or forced to beg money from indifferent acquaintances.  His wife can't understand that his inability to 'be' a 'man' is the result of the civilisation she represents.
What's a poor honest farmer to do when he sees murderers and thieves throwing money around, drinking their fill, bedding beautiful strangers, and generally living the whooping-it-up life?  Glenn Ford is the not-completely-irredeemable leader of a gang of devoted sadists so feared throughout the region that no lawman dares touch him.  Such men are usually let down by their sexual desire, and when he leaves his gang to schmooze a barmaid, he is captured by the locals.  Knowing that they will be no match for the manpower or ruthlessness of the gang when they return to rescue Ford, the sheriff plans a decoy, which will need two foolishly brave men to take the bandit to the train station at Contention City.  The initally reluctant Heflin accepts the job when a farm-saving reward of $200 is offered.
In many ways, 'Yuma' works against the conventions of the Western as it seeks, like the hero to avoid action and the inevitable climactic shoot-out for as long as possible.  The film's centre-piece is a lengthy, stagy sequence in a hotel room in which Heflin holds Ford prisoner - potential ponderousness is offset by the terrific acting of the two aging actors, one goading and testing the other, tempting with crooked offers that are all too tempting; the other struggling manfully to resist.  At first, Heflin's taking the job is strictly economical - he needs the money.  Then it becomes ethical, a stand against socially disruptive forces threatening the community.  It is also a test of the masculinity that has long been buried by family duties.  Finally, it is an existential struggle, with Ford as the man Heflin could easily become (and perhaps once was?), and his men as the instruments of inexorable Fate the farmer must face and outwit on his own, stripped of support, just as Man must eventually face Death.
The film's mise-en-scene is suitably austere, the black-and-white cinematography emphasising sharp contrasts, the alienating outlines of buildings and landscapes, and the vulnerable men and women who walk through them - sometimes watching 'Yuma' is like leafing slowly through an album of stark 19th century photographs taken of the West.  The 'city' in which the film is mostly played out initially seems like a ghost town, and a surreal funeral sequence interrupting, or accentuating, the tension, gives a quality of dream.  Delmer Daves' direction is not self-effacing - every shot is meticulously, often heavily composed, character patterns structured in frames creating a sense of constriction and claustrophobia that serves to turn the plot's screws.  What saves the film from being just another superfical 'High Noon' 'allegory' is the sudden bursts of violence rupturing the tense silence, and the ultimate refusal to wholeheartedly embrace doom-and-gloom existentialism.",1022025600,135,3689,5.049423393739703
617177,4,6303257348,"Van Heflin stars as a struggling rancher who agrees to guard outlaw Glenn Ford for $200 as he is being escorted to jail in Yuma.  Ford killed a stagecoach driver while robbing the coach, but he is backed by a loyal gang that everyone fears.  Heflin is assisted by town drunk Henry Jones.  There's a lot going on in this brief, tense western.  The relationship between Heflin and Ford is really interesting, as Heflin finds more courage than we thought he had, and Ford makes his character almost likeable as  he mentally works over his captor.  There is also an interesting relationship between Heflin and his wife, quite complicated given their brief time together on screen.  She seems to question his courage and strength of character.  Director Delmer Daves gradually builds the tension, but never allows it to let-up, propelling the story to its exciting conclusion.  The centerpiece of the film is the performances of the two stars.  Ford, not a great actor as a rule, really digs into this character and makes him quite memorable, while Heflin, a favourite character actor of mine, is totally convincing as the beleaguered farmer, forced into the role of hero that he never wanted, but wants to prove he can handle.  This may not be a very well known film, but it should be considered one of those hidden treasures that it's fun to unearth.  Suspenseful, well written, with enough action and atmosphere to make it a classic western.  Look for this one!",1004745600,8,1459,4.788
617178,5,6303257348,"When speaking of the great Westerns such as SHANE, THE SEARCHERS and HIGH NOON, 3:10 TO YUMA should definitely be mentioned.  All of these films came  out in the 50's, but 3:10 has somehow been forgotten.
Van Heflin plays a  farmer suffering from a drought.  He is a quiet, seemingly passive man who  becomes a reluctant hero.  Heflin agrees to hold criminal Glenn Ford in a  hotel room for $200 just long enough for the train to Yuma to leave at  3:10.  Ford's gang, however, learns about the situation and plans to take  action.  The characters and performances by Ford and Heflin make the film  work.  Heflin is outwardly reluctant to take this job, but his strength  lies within.  The struggle within him is evident:  Here's a family man who  can save his farm or do what he knows is right.  Ford, the criminal, is  alluring, almost charming.  He's a con artist and a cold-blooded killer,  but you can't help liking him just a little.  Sure, he's a criminal, but  not your typical stereotyped Western bad guy.  The suspense and tension  waiting for the train rival that of HIGH NOON (just without the clock!).  Even if you don't like Westerns, you'll like 3:10 TO YUMA.",967248000,65,1173,4.6
617179,4,6303257348,"This 50's Western. which received great reviews on it's debut, is well worth the praise.  The psychological build-up is gradual, with smaller peaks along the way (the man hanging by the stairs is a particularly  memorable one) until the viewer is as tense as the characters.  The  characterization is excellent and it stars several well-known names,  including Glenn Ford and Van Heflin.

617428,5,6303257348,"This Western was written by Elmore Leonard, before he started writing gangster stories.  It is a taught, tight story about a desperate man taking an outlaw to the train to Yuma, to the Yuma prison.  Van Heflin stars as the ordinary guy who, because his family is starving from a drought, agrees to this task.  He finds he is all alone.

Yet, he continues.  And along the way, the outlaw develops a respect for him.

This was one of the best of the 1950s westerns.  It was remade a few years ago as a shoot-em-up, and ended up being very boring in comparison.

If you like Westerns, especially those of the original variety, there really are only a few better than this one.  It represents the height of a genre of movies (Westerns) that we hardly ever see any longer.  A shame.",1492041600,2,777,4.408450704225352
617429,1,6303257348,"I like Glenn Ford and consider him a good actor. Here, he seems to be miscast as the villain, the leader of a gang of robbers. Ford exudes integrity and appears like a man who upholds the law and not breaks it. I wonder whether Van Heflin, who I also think is a good actor, should have swapped roles with Ford.

The scenes are virtually played the same with the same rhythm. There's almost no dramatic tension and the music in the background doesn't help. It's like elevator music. There are no high points or calm points for contrast.

I expected more from the talent involved especially with a story from Elmore Leonard.",1489881600,,622,4.495575221238938
617430,4,6303257348,"This is a really well done western from the 50s.  Glenn Ford is one of my favorite actors from that era.  Generally he plays a good guy.  In this movie he plays a heavy.  He is really very good.  Van Heflin plays a family man who has to transport Glenn Ford's character to the authorities in Yuma.  Van Heflin plays a family man in another very great 50s western ""Shane"".

The movie is made in black and white.  Nonetheless the cinematography is excellent.  The musical score is very good.  This movie has a ""High Noon"" feel to it.  The movie moves in close to real time like ""High Noon"".  The tension slowly builds.  It s really quite well done.  It is not the best movie I ever saw, but I nonetheless enjoyed this movie very much.

The movie is based on a short story of the same name written by Elmore Leonard.  The short story and the movie are very similar, but there are important differences.  I would say I liked both the short story and the movie about the same.  I also listened to an audiobook of the short story, narrated by Henry Rollins.  It was an excellent narration.

A father and his two sons have to stand by watching as a stage coach is robbed and a man killed. They cannot help. They have no guns. The sons are children. They can do nothing also when the robbers take their horses. But the father feels that his sons lost some respect for him even though it is impossible to do anything more than watch.
He has other problems. He has no money and no water for his cattle. He tries to borrow money from the bank but is refused. If he only had $200, he has a chance to save his ranch. And if it only rains this would help, but there is no chance for rain and no chance to get $200. And, to make matters worse, he feels that his wife is losing respect for him as well.
Then the head of the gang is captured. The gang of seven in addition to their boss are killers. Everyone is afraid of them. Everyone without exception. The robbed stagecoach owner offers $200, just the amount he needs, to take the head killer to Yuma, on the 3:10 train.
Needing the money, he takes the job. Others say they will join him, but when they realize they will be facing seven killers, they leave. One man stays and is killed. He is alone.",1483920000,,1398,4.124542124542124

""There's a legend and there's a rumor, when you take the 3:10 to Yuma, You can see the ghosts of outlaws go riding by."" - Washington/Duning

Five FERVENT Stars! This is the outstanding, original 1957 western movie, ""3:10 to Yuma"", produced during an era when Hollywood was cranking out westerns with regularity, but this is one of the all-time best. Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this one stars two great actors of the silver screen: Glenn Ford as the ruthless outlaw with a sensitive side, Ben Wade, and Van Heflin as the desperate rancher, Dan Evans, out to help his family and more. Both deliver outstanding performances, as does the rest of the cast.

When the Butterfield stage is held up by Wade's gang amid some violence, Wade is later captured and needs to be taken to Yuma by train. Three men step up to get him there.

The theme song, which is heard throughout the movie, was written by Ned Washington and Charles Duning, mostly sung by Frankie Laine, repeatedly whistled by Ford, and is one of the most memorable western themes from the era. Also starring the great Felicia Farr, Leora Dana, Richard Jaeckel, Henry Jones, and Robert Emhardt as Butterfield. Directed by Delmer Daves. This movie stands up very well to today's dramatic standards with a balance of less violence and more drama than the recent excellent 2007 Russell Crowe-Christian Bale version. Highly Recommended. Five TENSE Stars. (Columbia Pictures. Not Rated but clean language and some violence. Black & White. HD. CC. Time-1:32:26.)",1464480000,2,1522,4.8687258687258685

3:10 to Yuma (1957) stars Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, and Felicia Farr.  This is the ORIGINAL movie, not the 2007 remake starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.  This 1957 black-and-white western is a classic that's very similar to High Noon (1952) in that both movies are suspenseful with dangerous situations and involve the arrival of a train.  The acting is good, the musical score is decent, the cinematography is great, the camera angles are great, the action is good, and the suspense is good.  This movie definitely has much more scenery than High Noon, which has very little.

I highly recommend this movie as well as High Noon.  Both movies are entertaining western classics.  I rate 3:10 to Yuma 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5.",1455408000,2,851,4.813793103448276

Glenn Ford gives an interesting portrayal of an outlaw with a set of values better than many so-called good guys.

Other supporting actors like Henry Jones and Robert Emhardt also give strong performances.  Felicia Farr is also good in here as a sad saloon girl.

617968,5,6303257348,"A personal favorite film of mine. Several years ago I had the chance to visit all the areas mentioned in this film- Bisbee, Yuma, Fort Huachuca, Contention { no longer there, but some ruins remain}. And I was there before I had ever seen this movie. The locations are pretty good representations. So not only was it a treat to see an area that I fell in love with. But the movie itself is so much more than scenic beauty. In my opinion this is one of the finest B&W films. Van Heflin is outstanding. And I believe this is Glen Ford's greatest role. The rest of the cast do an admirable job. But Heflin and Ford are both tremendous stars in ""3:10"". And I really like how this movie ends. All through the film you get the feeling that it will end in tragedy. But surprisingly it does not. I know that movie endings of the time always had the hero victorious in the end. But this time, you're really glad for it. Glad for the villain too.

If you like this movie, it's one of those you'll revisit every now and then. Definitely what I consider a ""six pack of beer in the basement next to the stove on a cold winter night"" movie.",1410393600,4,1125,4.208333333333333

They even sketched a map in the dirt and pointed out distances to Benson and Fort Huachuca, which were correctly placed, but then had the temerity to imply that they could reach Nogales by nightfall (86 miles! - on horseback?). Aarghhh!

In this excellent film, Glenn Ford is the charismatic Ben Wade, while Van Heflin is the saintly Dan Evans. The main thing that struck me was the fundamental shift that has taken place in American movies. This 1957 movie is also fraught with tension, but it takes place mostly in a hotel room and is far more psychological. The 2007 version has Wade's heartless gang raiding Evans' ranch, burning his barn and scattering his cattle (I don't think they killed his dog...). It is far more bloodthirsty and much of it takes place out on the trail; it even includes an Indian raid. The end is vastly different with Dan Evans dying in the newer version, while in the original he will collect his hard-earned money, pay off his debts and enjoy the rainstorm that has just broken the drought.

618080,5,6303257348,"In 1880's Arizona Territory rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) with his two young sons  are out searching the outer limits of his arid ranch for lost cattle when from a distance they see the Butterfield stagecoach being held up by the infamous Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang of outlaws using Dan's cattle to block the stage. During the holdup Wade shoots the stage driver and one of his own men who the driver was shielding behind. Dan, his boys and the stagecoach are relieved of their horses so they can't follow the gang. Wade and his gang stop for a drink at the saloon in the nearest town of Bisbee, Arizona pretending to be regular cowboys, they tell the townsfolk of the nearby holdup and all the men bar one take off to investigate.

Wade stops on too long in town after he falls for pretty barmaid Emmy (Felicia Farr) and is captured by the returning townsfolk. The town marshal (Ford Rainey) and stage-line owner Mr Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) look for two volunteers to escort the prisoner to Contention City to catch the 3:10 to Yuma train and on to the territorial prison! With no volunteers Mr Butterworth offered $200 per volunteer Dan volunteered straight away this being just the right amount of money he needed to put him after three years of drought! The only other offer was from the town drunk Alex Potter (Henry Jones) which was reluctantly accepted

To foil the following gang Wade is put on a stagecoach out of town but is removed during a fake coach break-down; here Wade is removed and taken to the Evans  ranch where Dan's wife Alice (Leora Dana) serves them supper. Dan and Alex sneak Wade away under cover of darkness reaching Contention by daybreak where Butterfield has arranged a hotel room for them whilst they secretly wait for the train. Tension mounts as one of Wades gang come into town one by one all Dan's supporters disappear including Mr Butterfield  but against all odds Dan is determined one way or the other that he is going to put Wade on that 3:10 to Yuma.....

Writer and director Delmer Daves directed many other fine westerns including BROKEN ARROW (1950), THE LAST WAGON  (1956) and JUBAL (1956) which also starred Glenn Ford. In this taut western Ford plays the charismatic anti-hero Ben Wade. The reluctant hero in this instance going to the second lead the excellent Van Heflin as Dan Evans. A fine physiological western shot in black and white, often compared with HIGH NOON (1952) it also has an evocative theme song  written by George Duning and Ned Washington, the singer was Frankie Laine.

618138,5,6303257348,"Wow. I've long been a fan of westerns - I must have more than 50 of them in my DVD collection. How in the world has this one escaped my attention for so long? Without question, one of the best of the genre I've ever seen. The performances of the principle actors, Glen Ford and Van Heflin, could not be improved. Ford as the weirdly contradictory bad man (simultaneously gentleman and cold-blooded murderer) and Van Heflin as the desperate small time cattle rancher willing to stake all to save his ranch and his family are unforgettable. Felicia Farr's role as the frustrated and lonely Emma, although all-too-brief, is flawless.

The plot sets this movie squarely in the sub-genre of ""claustrophobic western"", along with the likes of Rio Bravo and El Dorado, with the action largely restricted to the confined space of a hotel room, surrounded by bad guys. Other than the very end, this is not your typical ""shoot 'em up"" - it's deeply psychological, with the dramatic tension wound up almost to the breaking point. The ""action"" is largely interior. Just who is Ben Wade (Glen Ford)? Can Dan Evans (Van Heflin) be bought off?

Well this might have occured with indians, but never would of occured with outlaws at that time. It's the thinking of present day folks/movie writers that were seeing actors doing things that would never happen. This makes good business for current movie makers I guess? The older verison of 3:10 Yuma was an great movie and I would recommend it for everyone as it's way more realistic and believeable than the new verison. I realize for the today movie views they need folks shooting hundreds of people while riding a horse backwards with a sucking chest wound if you get my drift.

618221,5,6303257348,"This fine movie fully deserves its reputation as a classic. Director Delmer Daves has created an engrossing, suspenseful study of character and values and drawn fine performances from all his leads.

The heart of the film is an examination of cowardice. The Van Heflin character, Dan Evans, stands by as a gang, led by Glenn Ford's Ben Wade, robs a stage coach and cold-bloodedly murders the driver. Dan's sons and, later, his wife Alice (played by Leora Dana), ask why he didn't try to do something to stop the thieves.

Later, Dan faces strong temptations to abandon his commitment to get Wade on the train to Yuma to face justice, but pursues his hard course, even though he expects that doing so will cost him his life. The script deals with these issues skilfully, putting believable words into the characters' mouths and avoiding preachiness.

On repeated viewings of the movie, I have become more appreciative of Ford's performance. Watched closely, he goes beyond an apparently avuncular and unthreatening front so that a hardness and willingness to kill to get what he wants can be seen behind the smiles and smirks.

Van Heflin's role is more straightforward but, as usual, he delivers convincingly as a good man made desperate by economic stress and nagging self-doubt about his courage. Set in a claustrophobic hotel room, the scenes between Ford and Van Heflin work well as the Ford character needles and pushes at Dan Evans, trying to tempt him into weakness.

 Leora Dana's performance as Dan's wife is a small glory of movie acting. Her face conveys so much of the weariness and desperate love of the character that the words she speaks seem almost superfluous. Understandably, the director sends the camera close in on her extraordinary face at every opportunity.

Richard Jaeckel also plays well in his role as Wade's devoted and psychotic deputy.

The exterior scenes have a gritty, dusty look, making you feel the drought that has blighted the efforts of Dan and Alice Evans to make their cattle ranch work.

The film ends with a strong message that the future of the West lies in strong family values and hard work and that the highwaymen and their easy ways will not be the builders of a great nation. And goodness will be rewarded.

618300,5,6303257348,"Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and fleshed out in a way quite unexpected, `3:10 to Yuma' is one of the better Westerns I've ever seen.  This is saying a lot, or maybe not so much, considering that I am not a fan of the genre much at all.  I was intrigued to see this original 1957 film because I really enjoyed the 2007 remake which starred Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.  This original is a different animal all together; a film that is similar in storyline (obviously) but different in overall construction.

I really like what James Mangold did with the material, but this film, helmed by director Delmer Daves, possesses more depth.

The basic premise follows a rancher named Dan Evans who is falling behind in profits and is on the verge of losing everything he has.  He witnesses a robbery and a murder and winds up getting an interesting proposition.  He gets offered $200 to help escort the famed criminal Ben Wade to the train that will take him to prison in Yuma.  Wade's gang, the group that Dan witnessed kill a man, is hot on their tales and threatens Dan's very life as he stops at nothing to serve justice.  All the while, Ben is working his conniving magic to try and turn Dan and get him to switch sides.  He prays on Dan's vulnerability and his desperate situation, never banking on the sense of morality the man possesses.

What makes `3:10 to Yuma' such an interesting story is that it isn't as focused on the action as it is on the building of character.  The way that both Ben and Dan interact is what builds the foundation of the film.  Mangold's remake upped the ante when it came to the action sequences, and that final shootout at the train is better executed in the remake, but this original film seems to lay a stronger foundation with the building of character.  While I felt that Crowe's interpretation of Ben Wade was stunningly savage and deserving of all the praise it garnered, it betrayed the original concept of the man.  Glenn Ford's portrayal, while not as engrossing because of not being so aggressive, adds a sharper layer to the man because we see the old world loyalties that make for a more respectable character, despite his occupation.  Where the 2007 film relied on savagery to convey that gritty Western feeling, this 1957 original incorporates more of the values of the western world in making a thinking man's film.

Van Heflin is phenomenal here, truly fleshing out the intensity behind Dan's convictions.  Where Bale was effectively conserved and broken, Heflin ignites the film with a rich aggression needed to stand ground against Ben Wade himself.  In other words; Russell Crowe swallows Christian Bale whole, whereas Van Heflin gives Glenn Ford a major run for his money (and winds up winning, in my opinion).

With a score that accentuates the atmosphere and cinematography that is TO-DIE-FOR, `3:10 to Yuma' is a winner on all accounts.",1344816000,2,2901,4.718253968253968

618303,5,6303257348,"3:10 to Yuma is the story of a down on his luck rancher played by Heflin who stumbles on a stage coach robbery by Ben Wade's (Glenn Ford) gang.  Heflin helps the local authorities catch Wade later that day.  The problem of course is that Wade's gang--temporarily led by Charlie Prince (Richard Jeckal) don't intend to sit around with their boss in custody.  Ultimtely Heflin is stuck with the town drunk trying to sneak Wade to the Contention railroad station for the 3:10 train to Yuma while a decoy wagon attempts to divert Prince.  Naturally the decoy fails leaving Heflin the stark choice of whether to complete his mission against stark odds.

Ultimtely 3:10 to Yuma is an enjoyable Western with some interesting qualities.  Firstly, the story does not primarily revolve around shootouts.  There is brief violence at the stage coach hold-up and naturally some characters get killed off near the climax.  However, like High Noon, the story is mostly psychological.  In this case it is the mental conflict between the charming but lethal Wade and the worried but ultimtely determined protagonist.  Both Heflin and Ford do an excellent job portraying their respective characters.  Ford especially brings to life a fascinating antagonist in Ben Wade.  Wade can be ruthless but has a sense of honor.  He is dangerous but charming.  He is skillfully manipulative and some of the film's power are the scenes in the Contention hotel in which Wade attempts to bribe his captor or catch him off guard.

Of course comparison will arise with the recent remake with Russell Crowe as Wade and Christian Bale as the rancher.  The remake is certainly darker and relies more on action (the body count is far higher).  Crowe does an excellent job in his own portrayal of Wade.  However, I found Ford's characterization to be a little more realistic.  Crowe's character in the remake is simply so much more lethal with firearms or knives than any of the other characters that his advantages seem a little too stacked.  Ford's character is dangerous but seems somehat more evenly matched.  I generally like Christian Bale's acting abilities but Heflin comes across more of an average person.  It is kind of ironic that in the remake Bale had much more difficulty controlling Crowe but was an excellent gunfighter otherwise.  While Heflin's character in the original apparently has some firearms skills, he mainly outwits Wade's gang with wits (cunningly positioning Wade so that getting in a shot would be difficult for instance).  Ben Foster's portrayal of Charlie Prince in the newer film is probably one of the few superiorities in my opinion of the newer film.  Jackel does a good job in the original but Foster plays the role as a lethal sociopath which creates a particularly adequate menace for Bale's character.  I certainly preferred the original film's ending to the newer remake (I will refrain from telling either to avoid spoilers).

Directed by Delmar Daves, this is the original version of the film re-made in 2007 with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I have not seen the re-make, but this version would be hard to beat. Heflin plays a small cattle rancher who is struggling to keep his ranch going due to a severe drought. Ford plays against type as the leader of a band of outlaws who hold up a stage and kill the driver. When Ford is captured by a posse, the focus of the film becomes keeping Ford's gang from freeing him before he can be put aboard the 3:10 train to Yuma to stand trial. When the owner of the stage line offers $200 to anyone that will guard Ford and get him safely aboard the train, Heflin takes him up on the offer. A battle of nerves and will ensues as Ford tries various ploys to get free before he can be put on the train. Reminiscent of such westerns as HIGH NOON and LAST TRAIN FROM GUN HILL, this is an excellent western and both Ford and Heflin give fine performances---I recommend this film to any fan of westerns.",1257638400,3,1090,4.348039215686274

618380,5,6303257348,"I'm glad I saw the original first.  Short comparison: original is genuinely great; remake is merely good.

Longer comparison: the original handles the hero and villain very differently from most movies, especially from that era. The bad guy isn't your typical villain. He has a sense of morality, but he's not a tragic villain, as would usually be the case. Very interesting character. The hero, too, acts from very human (fallen) motivations, and his ultimate choices make him that much more triumphant morally. The pacing and location shots also make this film stand out.

The remake has a lot of good points, but any improvement over the original is superficial.  The costuming, casting, locations, and action scenes are all great and make for an entertaining picture.  But the real meat of the original story is watered-down in Mangold's version.

The biggest change was the inclusion of Dan's kid in the story. In the original, it was sufficient to show his family's disappointment at his ranch and then leave him to wrestle with that on his own for the rest of the movie. Keeping the kid around the entire time artificially created a tension that wasn't as interesting or dramatic, because it took focus away from Dan and also diluted Dan's decision-making process. (If the kid is right there, there's much more pressure to ""do the right thing,"" and it makes his choice less about him having the courage to do what is right and more about ""well, can't look bad in front of the kid.""  The decision is more powerful in the original, where the only witness to it is Wade.)

This hurts my favorite aspect of the original, that being the moral conflict between Wade and Dan. It's just not as well-executed in the remake. I really felt for Dan in the original, and you could clearly see this moral anguish going on in his head as Wade tortures him in the hotel room. It was profound stuff, and it comes off as forced and awkward in Mangold's version. Also, it's not as efficient in its storytelling. The real heart of the 1957 version centered entirely around waiting in the hotel room, which was the most interesting and provocative part of the story, while the 2007 version treated that scene like any other and just moved through it.

Another (rather odd) negative aspect is Bale's physicality versus Van Heflin's. For whatever reason, Mangold made Bale scrawny, greasy, and weak-looking. You never once thought he could take Crowe in a fight. In the original, Van Heflin is physically bigger than Ford, and this makes his character that much more tragic. It's a minor detail, but it made me sympathize with him more. Here is a man who you can see once had the respect of others, who had control over his own destiny, and who has now lost the respect of his own family and has to beg for money. The physical difference tipping the other direction worked better for the conflict between Ben and Dan.

All that being said, both are worth watching, but the original remains the only truly great Western of the two.

Regarding the DVD: it's a fine transfer of a black-and-white classic.  No extras to speak of, but worth picking up.  Here's hoping for a Blu-Ray release one day!",1255478400,12,3177,4.712996389891697

618382,5,6303257348,"I love this movie. It is one of the best cowboy movies ever and certainly the best of the three starring Glenn Ford that Delmer Daves directed. I like it more than the Russell Crowe version.  For me, monochrome format focuses attention on the dialog and the actors' expressions: There's no spectacular color to distract from these. Glenn Ford is at his quiet, calm, and powerful best in this movie. He's one of my favorite actors. The story line is very believable. It's a study of farm life in Arizona in the latter half of the 19th century and the hardships and desperation faced by farmers in those times.  It's also a study of two personalities: each one hard, determined, and pragmatic. In the end, each ends up respecting the other.  I think the agricultural theme plays a large role in this and it's interesting to watch it a second or third time from that perspective.  And that's what makes the movie a great one: it can be watched on several levels and from several perspectives.  It's also a good shoot-em-up too. Glenn Ford was offered the role of the rancher but asked for the Ben Wade (criminal) role after he read the script.

618386,5,6303257348,"""Destination Tokyo"" director Delmar Daves' ""3:10 to Yuma"" (1957) qualifies as one of the classic suspense westerns of the 1950s. Furthermore, in the larger context of westerns, this frontier drama follows in the boot falls of ""High Noon"" since it concerns a showdown between hero and villain based on a time deadline. Everything about this oater is solid and realistic with strong acting by a competent cast. Composer George Duning's haunting score heightens the tension in scenarist Halsted Welles' spartan screenplay. Welles' also penned another big western ""The Hanging Tree"" (1959) with Gary Cooper. Welles does an exceptional job of capturing the ironic essence of Leonard's short story, the first of the bestselling author's work to reach the big-screen.

""3:10 to Yuma"" opens with a close-up of parched earth somewhere in the Arizona territory. The camera tilts up to show a stagecoach crossing the landscape in long shot and then the stage swings around toward the camera and its galloping six-horse team hauls the vehicle past the camera trailing a plume of dust. Daves concisely establishes in this one take the inhospitable nature of the surroundings. One of the themes is then man versus nature. Later, we learn that a drought has devastated the area. Seasoned lyricist Ned Washington's words--as sung by vocalist Frankie Lane at his most doleful--enhances this western. An entire sub-genre of sagebrushers emerged in the 1950s that opened with images of horsemen riding through the opening credits with singers such as Frankie Lane or Tex Ritter warbling an atmospheric theme song.

Glenn Ford makes a memorable entrance as ruthless but sardonic outlaw Ben Wade. The notorious Wade gang hold up a stagecoach. During the robbery, the stage driver gets the drop on the Wade gang member atop the coach and shoves a gun into his back. The brave driver threatens to kill the Wade gang member if the outlaws don't cease and desist. No sooner has he delivered his ultimatum than Wade himself rides up and guns down his own man and the stage driver.

The hero of ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a small potatoes rancher, Dan Evans (Van Heflin of ""Shane"") who is waging a losing battle against nature for lack of rain. Dan's cattle are dying, and all our hero requires is $200 dollars so he can obtain six months water rights from a nearby rancher. Unfortunately, Dan is dirt poor. Furthermore, he is stubborn and self-reliant and balks at the idea of seeking a loan from the bank. There is nothing flashy about Heflin's performance or wardrobe. Truly, he is a hero behind the 8-ball.

After the Wade gang rob the Butterfield Stage Company of a gold shipment, they gallop brazenly into Bisbee, Arizona Territory, to alert the local constabulary about the hold-up. In the saloon, where they are drinking, they explain that they couldn't thwart the thieves. The marshal (Ford Rainy of ""Flaming Star"") gathers a posse, but one of them, the town drunk Alex Potter (Henry Jones of ""Vertigo""), is late and rides out after the posse has left. Meanwhile, Wade disperses his gang across the border and tells them to rendezvous with him in Nogales. Wade hangs around the saloon to sweet talk young beautiful Emmy (Felicia Farr of ""Charlie Varrick"") and they get romantic. During this interval, the posse run into Dan and the Butterfield Stage owner. They describe the gang and the marshal realizes then that the cattle drovers back at the saloon were the Wade gang. Alex rides up and tells them that the drovers left town but one of them stayed. The posse heads back to town. Dan distracts Wade in the saloon while the marshal sneaks up behind him and arrests him. The Butterfield Stage owner (Robert Emhardt of ""The Stone Killer"") offers $200 to anybody that will help escort Wade to the train station for the titular three-ten to Yuma. Initially, Dan refuses but decides that the $200 dollars is worth the risk. Nobody else wants to get in on the money except Henry Potter. For the remainder of the movie, Dan and Wade share the upstairs bridal suite in the hotel while they await the train. Wade's second-in-command Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel of ""The Dirty Dozen"") rides off to prepare a reception for our hero and Wade. Eventually, the gang capture Henry Potter and string him up in the hotel. During the suspenseful wait in the hotel, Ben Wade begins to have a grudging admiration for Dan Evans. When they make dash for the train, Ben actually helps Dan out and they get aboard the train unscathed. Although this ending has been called implausible, I don't think it is anything of the sort. Ben Wade is a dangerous, egotistical killer who has the attitude of a cat playing with a mouse. He is so confident of himself that he plays along with Dan, helps him against his own gang, but ultimately you know that Ben Wade is never going to serve a day in jail. He proved at the beginning that he was willing to kill one of his own men.

""3:10 to Yuma"" isn't the first time that Glenn Ford played a villainous killer. He portrayed a corrupt, maniacal judge in ""The Man from Colorado,"" and before that he specialized in bad guys that turned good in westerns, like ""Texas"" and ""The Desperados."" Charles Lawton's stark black and white photography combined with striking camera angles that thrust us into the vortex of the action go a long way toward making the action palatable. Eventually, this drama boils down to two men shut up in an upstairs hotel room as they wait for the arrival of the ""3:10 to Yuma"" train. Daves and Lawton generate a lot of suspense throughout this western but none more tangible than at the end when our hero and villain approach the puffing train and are obscured by clouds of the steam while the outlaw gang stalk them",1228608000,5,5729,4.782828282828283
618387,5,6303257348,"This 1957 release is never mentioned in the same sentence as HIGH NOON, THE SEARCHERS or SHANE, but like those classic films, it is one of the great westerns.  It is also a much better picture than the 2007 remake that starred Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.

Notorious, albeit charismatic, outlaw Glenn Ford and his gang rob the Butterfield stagecoach, killing the driver.  Captured after he dallies for a romantic interlude with saloon girl Felicia Farr, Ford is then transferred to a nearby town to await the afternoon train to the Yuma prison.  His guards are two paid volunteers, Van Heflin, a hard-working rancher who desperately needs the money, and the town drunk, Henry Jones.

The suspense builds as Heflin and Ford hole up in a local hotel room, knowing that the outlaw's men will probably arrive to free their leader before the train stops and that Heflin will be no match for them.

Delmer Daves directed this superb nail-biter that emphasizes character without sacrificing action, and which looks fantastic in black-and-white.

618388,4,6303257348,"They made this movie when I was 5 years old and I finally got around to watching it last night.  Don't know what took me so long but, obviously,  good things comes to he who waits.  ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a good, quality Western.  It isn't in the same category as ""High Noon"" but it stands tall on the next level.  What impressed me the most was the well-developed relationships that permeated the film.  Of course, the most impressive inter-action was between the Van Heflin and Glen Ford characters.  However, it seemed that just about every relationship was noteworthy as was the dialogue.  Kudos to actors, director, and writer.  The action was exciting yet not over done.  For example, there was a fair amount of gun fire but a minimal amount of fatalities.  That's something that's often overdone in the Western genre.  There was some romance but that was very well presented also.  The suspense was very real (the movie's title helps to enhance the suspense the same way ""High Noon"" helped to focus the suspense in that movie).  The ending had me a bit mystified but then I appreciated the way it turned around.

I like a good Western and I'm glad to see there are some I missed the first time around (and THEN some in the case of ""3:10 to Yuma"").  It is a style of movie that is regularly overlooked at Oscar time except when the occassional Big Name actor stars in it.  Yet, when properly developed, it can bring together action, romance, suspense, humor (Gabby Hayes anyone?) and wrap it all up in a morality play about good and evil.  Akira Kurosawa had his Samurai movies with the same purpose.  We Americans have our Westerns.  ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a reminder of why that can be something to be proud of.",1222732800,2,1709,4.522875816993464

618457,4,6303257348,"Perhaps due to the recent success of the remake of this short story by Elmore Leonard, this re-issue of the '57 classic western starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin was released. For students of screenwriting both versions offer an important lesson in the ""less is more"" axiom.  The original was a taut, short (barely over 90 minutes) tale that concentrated on its 2 main characters whereas the recent remake offers too many characters and subplots that makes this remake not as appealing as the original did. Also the characterizations of the 2 characters are quite different from the original.  Whereas Ford is shown as a bad guy who only draws when confronted, Crowe in the same role, is a Bible quoting psychotic who will shoot on mere provocation when crossed.  Also the farmer character as played by Heflin is now a disabled Civil war veteran who is burdened by marital problems with his wife. Also the ending has been drastically changed in the remake and a very unsatisfactory, nonsensical one at that!!  I've been taken to task for my criticism of the remake but I will hold steadfast to my opinion that if you build up sympathy for a character in a film--you don't kill him off unless there is a plausible reason for it which the remake did not have.  So do see this classic Western, because you'll finally appreciate what a fine under-rated actor Ford was in comparison to Russell Crowe.",1213747200,4,1396,4.728395061728395
618458,5,6303257348,"Glenn Ford is at his best as he subtly underplays a highly intelligent, sophisticated yet violent outlaw that seems to move at his own pace regardless of the action of others or time or circumstances. His character, Ben Wade, is one of the most unique individuals particularly in westerns, as he is a man of fine tastes, extraordinary courage mixed with a total lack of alacrity about whether he could be caught or killed. The fact that he can and does become violent enough to kill a man and whomever is in his way is oddly inconsistent with his cerebral abilities indicating that he could have had a highly successful life without crime. Van Heflin plays what is almost a stereotype for him as a less powerful and charismatic hero as his vintage role in the 1953 western ""Shane"" but Heflin's strong yet subdued principled character works well against Ford as he accepts the difficult mission, due to economic desperation and maybe because it is the right thing to do, to deliver the captured Wade to Yuma in time for the train. The interplay between the two characters makes the film as Ford's character sees positives in Heflin's struggling life with a supportive wife and family trying to scratch it out on a ranch that is on the verge of failure yet is owned, at least for the time being by Heflin. The film captures Ford's quiet and interested reflection that Heflin may have what he was always seeking, something concrete and real not just a life of escapism and it just about seems to amuse Ford with the thought. Ford's character is continuously fascinating, he is the legendary killer Ben Wade but he has excellent table manners, is particular about what he eats and even in the comfort he seeks. The drama builds as Heflin and his party, with Ford in tow, are being tracked by Ford's extremely violent killers led by actor Richard Jaeckel. The end is the typical confrontation in all westerns but much more realistic than its remake and a very satisfying film. One of the most intriguing westerns ever made due to the uniqueness and complexity of the Ben Wade character played by the great, and often under appreciated, Glenn Ford.",1207612800,4,2142,4.699468085106383

In this 1957 version, filmed in B&W, the protagonist and the antagonist are played by Van Heflin and Glenn Ford respectively.
What makes this film great is that it doesn't rely on gimmicks and special effects to carry the movie, it simply relies on very solid acting performances.
The interplay between the two lead characters is quite wonderful - Heflin is the down on his luck hero being tempted by the lure of easy money, Ford is the charming but evil villain playing a psychological war with Heflin.
As far as 3:10 to Yuma is concerned, this 1957 film is the definitive version to watch.

Other things done better--the hero's wife and kids had more respect for him.  In the newer version they basically treat ole Dan Evans like a loser, which doesn't seem to fit with the timeframe.
The romance between the head outlaw, Ben Wade, and the beautiful bartender was much better developed.
In this original, Dan doesn't go from crippled wimp to fearless hero.  He was already a tough man, so his refusal to take any bribes from Wade was so much more believable.

A stagecoach robbery, cattle dying from drought, a family being ground down by disappointment.

Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang feel entitled to take whatever they want and have nothing but contempt for all the weaklings they prey upon.  Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his sons witness the robbery but won't get involved and risk losing what scraps they have left.  His wife Alice (Leora Dana) is losing her respect for him and is willing to sacrifice what remains of Dan's pride to try and keep things together.

Events bring Dan and Ben together again and keep them together for the rest of the movie.  It is a test of Dan's integrity and also an examination of Ben's villainy, to see how far he will go and what he is willing to do to keep get and stay free.  The ending is controversial and causes all kinds of discussion.  I think it is a good ending and consistent with what we have learned about all the characters throughout the movie.  However, you will have to see it on your own.  I am not willing to spoil it, even though it is a fifty year old movie.  It is a reexamination of many of the themes that High Noon went through seven years earlier, but Dan isn't the brave Marshall, he is a simple farmer trying to keep body and soul together for his family.

Having now seen the new version, and it is very good, the performances by Van Heflin and Glenn Ford hold up very well.  They show all the shifting emotions and the layers of morality (and immorality) with subtlety.  This version isn't as bleak or hopeless as the new one and you might prefer one over the other, but I like both and am happy to let each stand on its own.

618522,4,6303257348,"What I liked most about this film is that it's not one of those predictable ""good guys vs. bad guys"" or ""cowboys vs. Indians"" that reduces everything to black or white, unrealistic simplicity.  This story is different in that the protagonist is a poor, nondescript rancher who agrees to take a captured troublemaker to catch the train (to go to prison in Yuma) just to make $200.00 and ease things for his family, as they have been suffering from a long drought.
And the prisoner isn't some slobbering villain; he's smart, capable and doing his best to talk the rancher into selling out  and compromising on his principles for more money; he even preys on the rancher psychologically, with his knack for saying things that will goad him.
The b/w photography contributes to the spare, stark story and to the drought-stricken countryside, while the actors do a fine job of keeping viewers riveted even when confined to a hotel room while waiting for the train.
The ending is a surprise that I will not spoil here. Rent it and be stunned.",1197417600,3,1035,4.712707182320442

618524,4,6303257348,"Although clearly inspired by ""High Noon"", ""3:10 to Yuma"" is sufficiently original, and has a lot of other good qualities, that it compares favourably with that earlier great film.

Glenn Ford stars as Ben Wade the leader of a gang of theives who at the beginning of the film rob a stagecoach. Dan Evans witnesses the robbery and is powerless to do anything about it. Wade takes Evans horses but allows him and his sons to walk away unscathed. In the second half of the film the two meet each other again, in completly different circumstances and the main plot unfolds.

The strong point of this film is its cinematography. Its beautifully shot in black and white and is presented in wide screen. The opening scene which unfolds over the opening credits deserves a special mention, but there are many other scenes which are excellently shot. Full credit to the director Delmer Daves and the Cinematographer Charles Lawton Jr. This element of the film merits 5 stars.

However, its not as good as High Noon, and had a few moments where I just didn't believe what was happening. Notable amongst these was the ending which seemed like a bit of a cop-out to me. I have not seen the remake yet (although I know someone who has and he was not impressed) but it will have to be very good to be better than this.",1195430400,,1303,4.536170212765957
618525,5,6303257348,"This is the prequel to the current 3:10 TO YUMA starring Russell Crowe. The endings are different and the 2007 version earns its R rating with some very graphic violence but Crowe does a great job and it might be an Oscar nomination(s). Having seen both, I like the original. The story is about a hard working rancher/farmer (Van Heflin) who is down on his luck due to the drought and is barely supporting his wife and two young sons. He and his sons accidentally witness the robbery of a stagecoach and the murder of the coach driver. It's the infamous Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his ruthless gang. Wade is captured and the owner of the stagecoach line offers $200 to anyone who will guard Wade until they can put him on the 3:10 TO YUMA to take him back to prison from where he had escaped. Heflin, desperate for $200 after having been turned by the bank for a loan, sees this as an opportunity for the money and as a chance to prove himself to his wife & sons who he believes are disappointed in him. Alone together for almost 4 hours in a hotel room as they await the train there is a kind of mutual admiration as well as hatred. Heflin admires Wade for his material success and self confidence but despises his lack of morality. Wade admires Heflin for his family and moral character but sees him as weak and vulnerable and is totally confident in his ability to bribe Heflin to let him go as well as in his gang who will rescue. The tension builds until you hear the whistle of the 3:10 TO YUMA and Heflin must make his way against great odds from the hotel to the train station. In the tradition of HIGH NOON, this is a well acted and written movie. You can watch this one with the entire family unlike the Crowe version. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews. 11/18/2007.

Turns out it was very well done, well directed, tight writing, artful delivery, great cinematography...  What I found most compelling about the film was the lead actors.  Bale tends to have pretty boy stamped on him in everything he does (though I think he's a fantastic actor), and as he plays a man quite truncated in his virility, I enjoyed seeing him act with such reserve.  He mastered understatement in this film, allowing subtler facets of his skill to come to the fore.  I do think he is creator to watch, and it's a pretty nice view to behold.  At the other end of the spectrum we have Crow, whom I've been impressed with but never truly blown away by.  Perhaps I am not so moved in this film either, but I was immensely impressed with Ben Wade.  Wade was richly presented in all his contradictory angles, so much so that I found I no longer minded that he was engineered by Crow.

I suggest one buy and enjoy the original film for what it offers: engaging film noir of the old west. It is not as violent as the 2007 remake, but action-packed, and just as gripping.

618639,4,6303257348,"Written with cultural conviction and set against the background of the Arizona Territory, '3:10 to Yuma'- based on Elmore Leonard's short-story - pits rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) against the crafty leader of his band of desperados - Ben Wade (Glenn Ford).  With outstanding support by rich character actors like Ford Rainey and Richard Jaeckel, there is a ""feel"" to this picture that is reminescent of ""Shane"" and ""High Noon"".

""3:10 to Yuma"" tells the story of a down-and-out rancher, Dan Evans, and his boys who stumble upon a brutal stagecoach robbery pulled off by the Wade gang.  Stripped of his horses and forced to walk, Dan and his boys meet up with a posse from Bisbee that has been duped into responding to the robbery location by elements of the Wade gang that have made it back to town.

When Dan and the posse enter Bisbee, Ben Wade's been too busy with the beautiful bar maid (Felicia Farr) to leave town.  He's captured and immediately dispatched towards Contention City - an actual pre-Statehood trading post that was located between Bisbee and Tucson.  From there, Wade is to be transported by train to the Territorial Prison in Yuma.  Dan Evans desperately needs the money being offered to see that Wade makes it on the train to Yuma and finds himself fighting off the Wade gang as they seek to prevent them from doing so.

Great performances by both veteran actors, great direction by Delmer Daves, and with a terrific score by George Duning and an equally wonderful song - by the same name - from the magnificent Frankie Lane make this film a must-see for western movie enthusiasts.

Glenn Ford gives a riveting performance as the outlaw leader, ""Ben Wade"" (""Jim Kidd"" in the Elmore Leonard short story) that is almost reptilian in its sinister overtones. He could almost be the serpent in the Biblical Garden of Eden. Van Heflin also shines as ""Dan Evans"" (""Paul Scallen"", Leonard called him in the short story), an ""everyman"" small rancher of principle who takes on the job of putting Wade on the 3:10 to Yuma out of both a desire for much-needed reward money, but also out of a sense of personal resposibility to do what is right. It is more that factor than the other when Evans is told the money will be paid to him regardless.

The simple precept of doing something because it is the right thing to do has basically become a concept of ""archaic silliness"" in the ""hip"" 21st century, so a whole new set of psychological motivations is applied to Dan's actions in the 2007 version, which weakens the product considerably in my estimation. I'll take this older version any day.

Another great performance in the film is turned in by Richard Jaeckel, who was seemingly always portraying a half-nuts , kill-crazy gunman in westerns of the period, both theatrical releases and t.v. series westerns.
Jaeckel's patented baddie is as readily identifiable here as ""Charlie Prince"" as he was earlier as Billy the Kid in ""Stories of the Century"" on t.v., or as Jesse Evans later in Duke Wayne's ""Chisum""...and in all spots during, after, and in between.

618644,4,6303257348,"3:10 to Yuma (Delmer Daves, 1957)

Delmer Daves is these days probably best remembered for the Jimmy Stewart vehicle Broken Arrow, but that's all about to change. A remake of 3:10 to Yuma is on the horizon, and that will likely have viewers looking up this oft-neglected minor gem. It may look like a Western and quack like a Western, but there's a lot more to it than there is to your usual Western.

The story concerns Ben Wade (The Big Heat's Glenn Ford), leader of an outlaw band who finds himself captured for the love of a woman. A local rancher, Dan Evans (Shane's Van Heflin), is down on his luck and in need of money; when the owner of a stagecoach line offers Evans enough money to irrigate his farm for the rest of the drought if he'll guard Wade until the authorities can put him on a train to Yuma prison, Evans can't jump fast enough. Thus begins a long, slow battle of wills between the two men-- slick, persuasive Wade and cynical, hardworking Evans. Sure, there's action. Tumbleweeds alone do not a Western make. But the real focus here is on the temptation of Dan Evans at the hands of Ben Wade. I'm almost tempted to compare it to Satan tempting Jesus on the cross-- the landscape does have a rather desolate Golgotha feel to it-- but I won't go quite that far.

While the battle of wills is the main attraction, the side bits never get in the way of it, instead building on the main battle. The end result is a movie that looks like it's got a lot going on, but is actually almost obsessively single-minded. Not an easy feat to pull off. Daves did a fantastic job with this one, and it deserves to be remembered well. ****",1189987200,11,1642,4.359477124183006
618645,4,6303257348,"3:10 to Yuma is an interesting blend of Western and Suspense, but more captivating still is its methodical examination of fleeting morals, blind justice, and the charismatic villain at the heart of the conflict.

Notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang rob a stagecoach transporting significant funds of one Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) and end up killing the driver in the process. Farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his son are witness to the tragic events but are unable to help, save for notifying the authorities. When Dan returns home and his son explains the day's harrowing event, his wife appears disappointed by his apparent lack of courage, though his family's safety was foremost in his mind. When Dan is forced to go into town to borrow money for his farm's upkeep, he discovers that Ben Wade has stayed behind and the desperate farmer agrees to help apprehend the nefarious criminal. Upon Wade's capture, Butterfield employs Dan to guard the outlaw until 3:10 when the train to Yuma will arrive and take him to prison. But when Wade's gang arrives in town to free their leader, Dan will find that honor and dedication may only lead to an early grave.

While 3:10 to Yuma may appear to be an action film, it is actually an intricate examination of character, both hero and villain, set against a suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in the old West. Van Heflin's protagonist represents the forces of good and parallels the difficulties present that don't always allow justice to prevail - at least not at first anyway. Honor and pride play an important role in Dan's decisions, as his wife's initial chagrin instigates his desire to bring Wade to justice. His belief in this subjective moral is so determinate that he even protects Wade from certain death just to attempt to deliver him to the law's judgement.

As unique and interestingly obstinate as Dan's demeanor is, the villain of the film actually overshadows him in charisma and stage presence. Glenn Ford's portrayal of outlaw Ben Wade is one of the finest character studies in cinema, as he approaches the role with a full palette of emotions and intentions, complete with a similar belief in honor and morals that deceptively shifts as the film progresses. The opening scene finds Wade nonchalantly killing one of his own men when held hostage, and such dispassionate violence would lead one to believe the vilest of villains stands before him. However, the narrative follows Wade just as much as Evans and we discover he stays behind in the town of Bisbee to woo the young bartender Emmy (Felicia Farr). His presence is so captivating in fact that not only does he get the girl, but she seems completely unfazed to learn that he is the notorious Ben Wade. When the outlaw is captured by Evans, their witty back-and-forth banter often reveals Wade to be the more entertaining of the two and most often it's hard not to root for the bad guy. The final confrontation with Wade's gang cements what we'd been expecting all along - the line between heroes and villains is a thin one, at least in this engaging battle of wits and integrity.

Though the plot is light on action, the story is heavy on suspense as Dan attempts to carry out his suicidal mission. Mind games replace gunplay and while the film's running time doesn't outstay its welcome, those expecting a nonstop shootout extravaganza may leave unsatisfied, while the film connoisseur will be delighted by the intricate character study. Reminiscent of deliberately paced suspenseful westerns like John Sturges' Bad Day at Black Rock and of course Fred Zinnemann's High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma deserves a place of its own in classic cinema for its daring antagonist and intent focus on the composition of heroism and the trials and tribulations it requires.

618724,5,6303257348,"Maybe it's my own Wyoming roots clouding my judgment, but I absolutely love a GOOD Western, especially those having Southwest settings, especially Arizona and Old Mexico -  having heard tales of them spun by my mother and father since childhood.

When the ""new"" version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" hit the previews, I suddenly realized I wanted to make the comparison since I often do that.  To make it even more enticing, I had never seen the old version.

The heart of the story centers around a good man, desperate for money, who unwittingly becomes ensnared in the capture of an outlaw, and as part of his volunteering for the paid work, he must ""take the prisoner to the 3:10 to Yuma"". The interaction between the psyche of the two men makes for a remarkable tale . He knows only too well that his prisoner, even though shackled, is not entirely handicapped by that fact; is probably smarter than he is, and certainly more cunning, honed to a razor sharp edge by profession, and backed by a well-organized gang of scoundrels who are still on the loose.

I rate this most excellent older movie 5 stars, even with a few oddities and the highly improbable ending.  (other than that, it had every possibility of having actually occurred somewhere back in time, which is one of the things I look for).

I'm amazed I hadn't seen it before.  It has all the essential elements of an enduring Classic:  a well written, well chosen and unique story line; great casting, and splendid direction, enhanced by a smoldering moment or two between male and female without the graphics deemed so necessary now. (not knocking ""now"", just making the statement that physical emotion can be transmitted very successfully without the graphics, which, in my view took much more thought process and showcased the talent of this director,who brought the story to life through the well chosen cast and his ability to bring out the best in each of them.)

But you know what? It's not a bad western at all, and Van Heflin is also pretty good in it (though the role he portrays here will easily remind you of the character he played in Shane.)

I am definitely a Glenn Ford fan, but the idea that Ford simply waits for the train to come and take him away, while he and Van Heflin sidle down the street definitely didn't move me. I'm sorry but the rest of the film didn't ring true either. Richard Jaeckel gets killed in a weird, unrealistic way, and Henry Jones gets lynched somehow. The scenes with Heflin's wife are stagey and uncomfortably hard to believe.

I would rate both Jubal and Cowboy much higher, more realistic, especially Cowboy. Check out Cowboy first and then Jubal. Either of these are better than 3:10. Sorry, Delmer Daves/Glenn Ford fans.",1172448000,5,702,4.661290322580645
618729,5,6303257348,"The desolate backdrop of the old west , coupled with the wonderfully wistful title song (sung by Frankie Laine), gives this 1957 Columbia film an intriguing opening, one which the viewer cannot help but be absorbed. Van Heflin is Dan Evans, a rancher whose family is threatened by drought, and who is asked to bring notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) to Yuma to stand trial, for a sum that will undoubtedly help his financial problems. Wade's gang is jailed after committing a stagecoach robbery and killing, but they escape, planning to rescue their leader, so Dan must keep one step ahead of them as he escorts the handcuffed Wade to the train station. Felicia Farr has a nice supporting role as the bar girl, Emmy, who falls for Wade - Ford's villain knows how to charm the ladies, so much so that almost every woman falls under his spell. His engaging manner with the girls - ""What's a woman for, if you can't treat her right?"" - his romantic way of telling stories, almost literally makes the female population swoon. Even Dan's wife Alice (Lenore Dana) is temporarily taken with Wade as he sits, handcuffed, at the dinner table, telling a tale of a girl that he knew with sea-green eyes. Heflin can't understand why women fall for this - after all, this guy is a outlaw and a killer. As the two men arrive at the station town, Wade's gang is ready to pounce and so Evans and Wade hide out in a hotel room, the bridal suite, no less, to wait. Ben then plays mind games with Dan, trying to escape, to beat him down. Although Alice wants him to save himself by allowing Wade to escape, Dan realizes that he has to do it - not only for the money, but because it's the right thing to do. The two guys form a strange bond, as Ben's gang closes in. Had things been different, they may have even liked each other. Wade allows Dan to get him onto the train, explaining that he doesn't like to owe anyone any favors. There is a tentative understanding between them as Dan waves to his wife from the moving train, while the final chords of the title tune and Frankie Laine's voice close this psychological, fascinating Western.

Ford's performance is just flawless; he embodies his redeemable bad guy effortlessly, whistling the title song throughout relatively quiet sequences. And he is cunning and manipulative, knowing what buttons to push, as he subtly degrades Dan for not being a good husband and father. Maybe it's my female perspective, but somehow I don't think I'd be immune to his penetrating gaze. After he and Farr engage in a passionate kiss, we see them a few moments later emerging from the back room of the saloon, fully clothed of course, but there can be no doubt of what had transpired between them. As he is taken away by Evans and the marshal, he promises to send her some pearls. Heflin gives just the right amount of selflessness, courage and compassion as the one who has to perform an unpleasant, risky task to support his family. These two underrated actors fill the screen, and it's hard to imagine any other leading men of the time bringing the protagonist and bad guy to life. An up and coming Richard Jaekel plays Wade's right hand, a fair-haired, cold-hearted sidekick who will stop at nothing to free his leader. He would later go on to have a succession of similar roles in several genres. Director Delmer Daves collaborated with Ford on three Westerns, all of which are gems.

The DVD: Transfer looks great, with a few extra trailers included: ""Bite The Bullet"", ""Silverado"" and ""MacKenna's Gold"".  It's a dual sided disc so that the viewer can choose between full screen and widescreen.

""Though you've got no reason to go there, and there ain't a soul that you know there, when the 3:10 to Yuma whistles its sad refrain, take that train . . . . . . . """,1164844800,7,3789,4.551319648093842
618730,4,6303257348,"Delmer Daves has certainly proved himself as one of Hollywood's most talented directors--at least in the Western genre... His ""3:10 To Yuma"" echoes ""High Noon"" in some respects, but to make frequent on the similarity misses the point of a very fascinating picture...

""3:l0 to Yuma"" is a classic among suspense Westerns, a serious examination of the nature of heroism of an ordinary man in control of a dangerous outlaw... It is fundamentally a distinguished psychological drama played out in the claustrophobic setting of a hotel under mental and physical siege... The film deals with two entirely opposing characters locked together in an isolated room where Daves' camera moves ceaselessly on their course of action...

After a holdup and the killing of a coachman with a gold shipmen, Ford is captured in a saloon, where he was wasting his time in amorous advances with a lovely barmaid (Felicia Farr).

But how to hold him? For his gang, who have made their getaway, will most likely be back to claim him... Ford is sure of this, as his care-free indifference makes it easy to see... The cowed citizenry (echoes of the Zinneman picture) become equally certain... Someone has got to get him out of local circulation and then on to a train to Yuma where he can stand trial...

Who will undertake such task?

The best offer comes from an austere farmer motivated by a severe desperation... Struggling Heflin sees in the 200 dollars his last chance of salvation as his means of subsistence are too little, and the prolonged drought is killing his cattle... For him, there is no other option...

So Ford expects his gang to follow him, and eventually they do... Richard Jaeckel--'the man who slept en the sofa' was how everyone remembered him in this picture--is sinister evidence of discovery...

In a hotel room, therefore, they sweat it out... Van Heflin does most of the sweating, trying to cope, until the train is due, with a situation beyond his experience... For Van Heflin is not even a true professional, as Will Kane was in ""High Noon"" (who had somewhat similar train-waiting problems), but an amateur, having to deal with Ford's every physical and psychological ruse; having, in the last resort--finding some sort of moral obligation in the job--to resist temptation...

The outlaw, an intelligent man, continually seeks for a way that will give him his freedom, but becomes deeply fascinated by his 'keeper'. What kind of creature is this who toils on some miserably piece of land, cares so deeply for it, gets no fun at all out of life and seems so greatly incorruptible?

Whatever he is, he's the complete antithesis of Ford... You get the impression that the outlaw is confronted by a being from another planet... Who wouldn't be intrigued?

Van Heflin could so easily have repeated his leading homesteader role in Shane, but, in fact, he adds another layer to him... Ford, in one of his best performances, and he has given many, gets the utmost from his greatest gift... The women in the picture, Felicia Farr and Leorna Dana, make a solid contribution to its depth...

With a nice musical score, this great psychological Western draws its drama and power from the interaction of two excellent characters rather than gun blazing action...",1162684800,5,3255,4.9
618731,5,6303257348,"Director Delmer Daves' 3:10 TO YUMA (1957, Columbia) ranks with John Ford's STAGECOACH (1939) and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946) as one of the finest B&W adult westerns ever made.  Told almost in real time, YUMA has Glenn Ford as an outlaw named Ben Wade being held hostage in a dusty old west town hotel room by farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin), who needs the money he is getting for the job.  That job is to guard Wade until the 3:10 to Yuma train arrives in town.  But Halsted Welles' complex script, from an Elmore Leonard story, has fun in switching roles.  Who is the good guy and who really is the bad guy?  And should Evans take Wade's offer to give him triple the amount of money that sheriff Robert Emhardt is offering Evans to led him go free?  After all, Evans is only in it for the money.  This is very suspenseful storytelling.  In a small cast, Felicia Farr is also excellent in a tiny role as a bartender.

I really love the look of 3:10 TO YUMA--Charles Lawton, Jr.'s dusty moderate wide-screen B&W photography, the sparce and empty town that seems to only have a saloon and hotel and train station, the real time editing, George Duning's ghostly music score, and Frankie Laine's unforgettably lonely theme song sung over the opening credits.  This is a great western for adults parched for an intelligent and evocative one.  I highly recommend it on DVD rental with a couple of cold beers.",1158537600,6,1402,4.5458167330677295

618783,4,6303257348,"310 to Yuma is a psychological western, adapted from a story written by the thriller expert Elmore Leonard, and filmed in beautiful black and white.  Glenn Ford and Van Heflin play the bad guy and the good guy, respectively, who are both struggling to survive in a barren land.  Ford's character is the leader of a notorious band of vicious, homicidal outlaws--a man who lives for the instinctive thrill of the moment.  Van Heflin is the cautious average guy who struggles to raise cattle in the middle of a drought and can't afford to pay for water rights until the rainy season.

When Ford gets caught by the law, Van Heflin is paid to get him to the train which will take him to jail.  Ford works on Van Heflin to persuade him to let him go.  At times listening to the two conversing, it sounds like two sides of the same man dark and light, one arguing to let this cause go and live safely, the other that he must do what is right.  They illustrate the elemental struggle for all of us--do we live for the moment or resist the seduction of the physical comforts of life in order to develop our souls.  This psychological duel is mirrored in the visuals of the film with sharply contrasting sunlight and shadow.  In the climactic scene, the two run a gauntlet of gunslingers to the train, the 310 to Yuma.

Ultimately the story is not one of good versus evil but the story of a man discovering his inner strength even if this means risking all he cares about.  Directing, cinematography and acting are all excellent.  Glenn Ford is particularly worth mentioning, playing the outlaw with creepy intensity.",1150416000,16,1607,4.541666666666667
618784,3,6303257348,"Somewhat more dated than a Western from around the same time, The Ox-Bow Incident, this is nevertheless a good solid Western, albeit with some real flaws. While it certainly does not have the cliched good guy-bad guy stereotypes, which is refreshing, there are some peculiar character quirks that just don't seem to add up--either that or somewhat sloppy plotting.

The ""bad guy"" is played by Glen Ford, although he's not all bad. This is shown in a) a kind of love scene with him and Felicia Farr, and b) his unusual ""working"" relationship with the ""good guy"", played by Van Heflin. Ford's the leader of a gang who robs stagecoaches, among other things, and he shoots a man in what appears to be cold blood, in one scene--while at the same time not harming a hair on the head of Heflin or his two young sons, who just happen to be in the vicinity at the time of the holdup.

As fate would have it, Heflin needs dough real bad since his cattle are dying from a drought and he has to get them water and feed in order to survive. The opportunity for dough comes up when the marshal of a nearby town manages to capture Ford (his character's name is Ben Wade) right after he sweet-talks the barmaid, played by comely Felicia Farr, into being his, ahem, girlfriend. The Heflin character's job is to escort Ben Wade (Ford) to the train, the 3:10 to Yuma, for which he'll be paid a nice chunk o' change--$200, to be exact.

One point of sloppy plotting is that after they part, she's never seen again. So, OK, bye, don't need ya anymore. The good old American way. Yeah, chalk that up to some kind of prescient sense of 21st century America or something. Another is why exactly Wade takes a shine to the Van Heflin character, so much so that he goes along with him completely, right to the very end. In fact, the very end of the film really doesn't make much sense at all. Are we to believe that all of a sudden Ben Wade really doesn't want to be a bad guy after all, but instead comply with the law--just because he owes the Van Heflin character??  I don't think so.

The ending is fairly botched and the love interest gets tossed away like a sack of old potatoes. Other than that, though, this has a lot of fine moments, including the scene depicting the fate of poor Alex Potter, the stage holdup, and even the love scene between Farr and Ford.

But this doesn't have the intensity and moral punch of The Ox-Bow Incident, one of the best Westerns of the 50s, hands down. Crime fiction fans may be interested to know that this film, 3:10 to Yuma, is actually based on an early novel by none other than crime fiction king Elmore Leonard, back in the days, about 50 years ago, when he was writing Western novels, believe it or not. (In fact he wrote about six or seven of them).

This is a good but not great film.",1131753600,7,2807,4.355640535372849
618785,5,6303257348,"Cool, well mannered but ruthless Ben Wade, leader of a band of outlaws has masterminded a stagecoach robbery killing the driver.  Wade played in a notable acting performance by Glenn Ford and his gang are observed by local cattle rancher Dan Evans played in solid fashion by Van Heflin and his two young sons.  Wade and his desperadoes vamoose to the local town of Bisbee where they evade the sheriff and his posse.  Dawdling in town on account of a pretty barmaid Ford gets apprehended as the posse returns to town realizing they'd been hoodwinked.

Stagecoach owner, the gutless Mr. Buttlefield played by the corpulent Robert Emhardt intends to see that Ford gets prosecuted for his crimes.  He recruits Heflin who is desperate for money to save his drought stricken herd to secret Ford to a nearby town to await the 3:10 train to the territorial prison in Yuma.  With the full knowledge that Ford's murderous gang will attempt to free him, the righteous Heflin with assistance from the town drunk embark on the dangerous journey.

They arrive in the town to await the train holed up in the local hotel.  As the minutes slowly tick past a gripping psychological drama ensues between the manipulative Ford and the forlorn Heflin.  Ford fails to seduce Heflin with promises of riches if he releases him, which would solve his problems.  Heflin shows great restraint and resolve in carrying out his mission against improbable odds, as men enlisted to assist him, one by one abandon him.

This taut drama ends on an improbable note as the experience has evidently forged a bond between the adversaries Ford and Heflin.

Defintitely borrowing a page from the classic and dramatic western ""High Noon"", director Delmer Daves rachets up the tension as the time draws closer to the arrival of the train. He uses Heflin's pocket watch to remind us of the waning minutes.  Ford does very well in his portrayal of the principled scoundrel, usually cast as the good guy.  Heflin reprises his role of the strong and ethical farmer that he played to perfection in ""Shane"".  The Sedona scenery where the film in part was shot, always adds authenticity and the required western flavor.",1126828800,3,2170,4.842818428184282

618787,5,6303257348,"I have been a hard fan of the western movies. I think this genre constitutes the true American mythology. And even if you weave fine, may be you will agree with me there are very subreptitious links with the Noir Film, the surroundings may change but the stereotypes still remain; the bad guys and the mob; the corrupt sheriff and the double moral policial agent, the greed and ambition simply translate from the horses to the thirty vehicles.

Consider for instance the case of John Huston; famous for Treasure of Sierra Madre and then by Maltese Falcon; or Anthony man with The Naked Spur and The Thin Man; Howard Hawks and Fritz Lang would be another two fundamental examples that would complete this statement.

3:10 at Yuma is a Western with multiple dramatic angles. We have to Delmer Davis in top form with an engaging and absorbing script, with wide references to the human behavior in the edge conditions.

I will not tell you any additional information my dear reader, because I consider this is one of the best twenty westerns ever made, so to make any simple reference would be to private you from a giant film. You have to experiment by yourself this outstanding picture.

618788,5,6303257348,"One of the first Elmore Leonard stories to be transposed to the big screen, 3:10 TO YUMA is, in my opinion, one of the best westerns of the 1950s and I wouldn't argue much with anyone who put it on their short list of best movie western of all time.  The story told is elegantly simple - bad man Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is separated from his gang and captured in a small southwestern town.  Small time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) is hired to guard Wade and get him onto the 3:10 train to Yuma, where he'll stand trial for robbery and murder.

  3:10 TO YUMA takes complex characters, puts them in an easily understood situation and allows a surprise or two to arise to test and challenge the characters.  Ben Wade may be a killer and a thief, a desperado, but as written by Leonard and played by Ford he's leagues away from the stereotypical western outlaw.  Early on in the movie Wade kills someone without hesitation and without remorse.  Oddly, though, he sees to it that the dead man is returned to his home for a proper burial.  Wade doesn't seem to particularly like killing, but it doesn't seem to bother him all that much, either.  Outwardly, he exudes a sincere, down-to-earth-charm with none of the shifty-eyed abrasiveness of most western bad men.  Ford, whose screen persona could encompass both charm and threat, is perfect in the role.  As is Heflin in the role of Dan Evans.  Heflin built a career out of portraying the thoughtful Everyman, the hard working, tough-luck-ridden yeoman who clung to his integrity long after whatever modest dreams of something better died.  Heflin is ideally cast as the principled small rancher who may have a sales price on his precious principles.  The backbone of 3:10 TO YUMA is the testing scenes between Heflin and Ford.  There are many of them, and they all crackle.

  The clock ticks down, Wade's gang - we assume - is gathering for a rescue attempt, and the good guys are beginning to sweat over their imaginings of the showdown at 3:10.  The highest recommendation for this essential movie.",1120176000,3,2049,4.638888888888889

For those not familiar with the names of the towns that were mentioned in their plan to get Ford to jail, these are all in southern AZ. ""Contention"", mentioned by another reviewer, was a silver mining community close to Tombstone.

The leader of a gang is captured by a posse after a robbery and must be transported to another town so he can be moved on the train.  One of the local farmers, who is in desperate need of money, agrees to travel with him and watch him until he can be put on the train, the 3:10 to Yuma.  All along the way, the outlaw plays mind games with the farmer trying to manipulate him into letting him go.  There is plenty here for western fans.  The dialogue between Glenn Ford and Van Heflin is the best part of the movie as they go back and forth between them while Ford plays his mindgames on the unwilling hero, Heflin.
 Glenn Ford gives one of his best performances ever as Wade, the smooth-talking, calm, but ruthless gang leader.  His character is perfect for this role, and could not have been done any better.  Van Heflin is just as good as the poor farmer watching over Wade.  It is easy to see the anger inside of him as Wade continues to push his buttons as they wait for the train.

7842676,4,6303257348,"RELEASED IN 1957 and directed by Delmer Daves, ""3:10 to Yuma is a Western about a struggling Arizona rancher, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), who has no choice but to hire-on as an escort of dangerous, but charismatic outlaw, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). Wade proceeds to employ psychological manipulation in order to corrupt the righteous family man and escape.

This is a quality psychological Western from the 50s, only held back by the B&W photography. The Arizona landscapes are spectacular but they're all for naught due to this flat B&W presentation. Nevertheless, the story & characters are great. The mind games Wade plays with Evans keeps things interesting. Felicia Farr, the hottie from Glenn Fords excellent Jubal (1956) is on hand as a bartender who has a thang for bad boys. Im not complaining about her role, but its a tad unlikely that such a smoking hot woman would be alone for too long in the Old West where there were twenty times more men than women.

Most old Western theme songs are hopelessly hokey, e.g. North to Alaska (1960) (a great Western), but the one here sung by Frankie Laine is very good. I like it when words that don't rhyme are made to rhyme in a song: ""There's a legend and a ruma', when you take the 3:10 to Yuma.""

The 2007 remake with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the Evans/Wade roles takes the template of this film and makes a superior Western with more action and deeper themes, not to mention IN COLOR.
