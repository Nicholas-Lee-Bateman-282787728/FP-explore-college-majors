3653883,5,B001JAHQPC,"This show is fantastically entertaining. So much more than a plain old detective show. Writing is excellent, cast is the best on tv.",1434412800,,132,4.782608695652174
3653884,5,B001JAHQPC,"It is Law & Order CI with Vincent D'Onofrio! So, of course it is awesome!",1430265600,,73,3.933333333333333
3653895,5,B001JAHQPC,Great show,1404691200,,10,4.5
3653896,5,B001JAHQPC,"Goren and Eames continue to outwit even the most diabolical criminal minds.
In The Finale Goren's Arch Nemesis, Nicole, returns. But the surprise twist ending of this episode does not end well for her.",1404604800,,201,4.9411764705882355
3653897,5,B001JAHQPC,"Law and Order, esp this one as well as the first Law and Orders with Sam Waterston have never failed me once...the cast along with the stories always simply have the magic of getting it right every time. I have seen all of the CI episodes and Chris Noth and whomever his partners...great every show......Vince D'Onfrio and Kathryn Erbe...what can I say? They were remindeers to me of Spencer Tracy and Katy or even that ability to just keep you watching as Bogie and Bacall did...something about D'Onfrio and Erbe clicked, I thought at least there was s chemistry there maybe from working so long together or friendship but they were/are my favorites.
I am very disappointed that the two of them were not paired up with Chris and there must have been enough to keep that show together...after all they started the other L & W shows.",1394064000,,832,4.628378378378378
3653898,5,B001JAHQPC,"I love the two main characters, Goren and Eames, played by Vincent D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe. I love Eames' deadpan expressions, the subtleties of the acting, and the character's steadiness played against Goren's volatile brilliance. Way intense episode: complex, profound, engaging, unexpected.",1393200000,,296,6.071428571428571
3653899,4,B001JAHQPC,"It is okay. It was sad to see it end. I was disappointed that there were only two dvd's. I felt shorted. The show is okay.
It really needs to be lower in price.",1388361600,,160,3.735294117647059

3653901,5,B001JAHQPC,What can i say Major Crimes Captures many real life stories while Emmes & Bobby compliment each other's talents. They both have interesting lives and connect very well. Trust Loyalty and equality.,1376352000,,196,5.15625
3653902,5,B001JAHQPC,"Surely the popularity of this television series speaks for itself and doesn't need my 5-star rating or review.  However, it is a testimony to how much I love it that I have purchased it on Amazon even though it seems to be on some channel most of the time.  BUT I want to see the shows I want to see when I want to see them.  And the viewing is great on my laptop. Terrific cast. Great writing.",1375056000,,394,4.0256410256410255

3653915,5,B001JAHQPC,Best actor on t.v. and he needs to come back in a leading role.  Kathryn Erbe is the quintessential compliment to this pair.  Bring them both back!!!!,1369353600,,150,4.518518518518518
3653916,3,B001JAHQPC,"got this episode to watch for a character Mary from the show ""In Plain Site"":  She had a cameo to promote her show.",1368748800,,115,4.0
3653917,5,B001JAHQPC,"The Greatest!  It is definitely worh seeing if you love law and order CI.  If you area l and a fan, CI, in particular, you woudl go bananas over this one.  It is great. I am a L&A lover.  I promise you will love it as much as I do.
Buy it. You will not be sorry.",1367366400,,262,3.543859649122807
3653918,4,B001JAHQPC,Law and Order fans will find this episode  a great episode to start off the seventh season.  Kathryn Erbe shines as Alex Eames and we get to learn some more details of her late husband's premature death. I recommend this episode.,1355356800,,229,4.560975609756097
3653919,5,B001JAHQPC,i MISS THIS SHOW SO MUCH.Fine acting and great story lines. I watch as many reruns as I can. Where are all the good writers now? Please come back.,1353974400,,146,4.068965517241379

3653921,5,B001JAHQPC,"I love downloading TV shows. Now I don't have to try to sell the DVDs anymore!
And the episode itself? I forgot! You see why I don't need DVDs laying around!",1268697600,,157,4.096774193548387
3653922,5,B001JAHQPC,"Season 7 was just an ongoing intense life walk for Bobby Goren/ Vincent D'Onofrio.  Can one person have so much trauma in their life?  Yes,  Vincent did an incredible job of projecting the internal grief and loss of each incident in his life. When he was sitting in his Mother's room after her death, I could see his pain and identify with my own loss of my mother.  Season 8 , while not as well written , viewers were at a disadvantage because the episodes were not aired in the order of taping. If we as fans and viewers had seen the episodes in order , I believe we would have seen Bobby on his way back from all the turmoil.  Recovery from loss isn't easy nor is it fast.  It does change the person. No one could have portrayed that any better than Vincent D'Onofrio. The studio did a disservice to the actors and the fans by not airing the episodes in sequence.",1250208000,,866,4.25
3653923,5,B001JAHQPC,"Criminal Intent seems to be fizzing out a bit.  The stories are not as intricate nor are they as interesting.  D'onofrio and Erbe appear to be in less episodes and they are the stars that make this show have its pizz-azz.  My favorite episodes were when D'Onofrio went under cover to help his nephew and received all kinds of psychotropic medications and shock treatment himself.  His poor nephew died and D'Onofrio was put on leave for psychiatric reasons.  He returns in season 8 but he looks none the better for wear.

It's hard for Criminal Intent to go wrong but I'd like to see some better writers get into the action.  I'd also like to see the return of D'Onofrio's Australian nemesis.  She made for an interesting adversary.  This is my favorite of all the Law and Order shows and I want it to keep up to the best of its best.",1244332800,,834,4.434210526315789
3653924,5,B001JAHQPC,Worth every penny and no commercials.  Best cop drama on tv.  I agree with the previous rating in that all unbox should be available in more formats.  I would certainly buy/rent alot more.  Specifically Ipod or Zune.  Very disapointed in that aspect.,1220313600,,250,4.857142857142857
3653925,1,B001JAHQPC,"I rated this a one star because I own a MAC, an IPOD and, also I don't have Tivo so there is no way I can download it.  Please make it a universal standard so everyone can download it and enjoy it.  There should be more choices in format like MP4 or AVI. Why would I buy something that I can't watch on what ever device I want to watch it on.",1219708800,,342,3.736111111111111

8312320,5,B001JAHQPC,"Love any season of Criminal Intent, so this was a slam dunk.  The price was cheaper than other seasons, so I chose this one to buy.  Can't get enough of Vincent D'Nofrio!  I may just spend the money for a season that's all him!!",1520121600,,228,4.136363636363637

8312323,5,B001JAHQPC,This has been my favorite tv show for years. I wish they had season 2-4 available but was excited to see season 1. Always interesting and Vincent Denofrio is so handsome even as he gets older. I love the mental health aspect of many of the criminals. Fascinating....,1508976000,,266,4.5625
8312324,1,B001JAHQPC,terrible quality. if you are picky like me and like 1080 HD then please don't purchase this. they don't specify the quality anywhere,1501891200,,132,4.782608695652174
8312325,3,B001JAHQPC,A few episodes are well written and acted but many are way too sensational.,1498348800,,75,4.428571428571429
