8504897,1,B006V6AL10,DON'T buy this dvd; it's poorly recorded by a camera that's way across the room. The dancers are remote and many of the acts take place in front of musicians and equipment. Oh and several acts are either in black and white or colors so washed out that they might as well be b&w. IAMED charges big bucks for this turkey. Video clips off the internet are a better value. It's a HUGE rip-off.,1367107200,,389,4.27027027027027
