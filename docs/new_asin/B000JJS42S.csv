8151003,5,B000JJS42S,"Very Good sitting resistance bands pilates exercises DVD.  The first part of the exercises are done with the bands for the upper body, and cover a lot of muscle groups. There are also leg press exercises with the bands, and lower body exercises that strengthen the lower back, hips and legs.  The exercises are  first shown and explained very clearly by the teacher, who then starts to do each exercise 10 times. The DVD is filmed on a beautiful nice sunny beach which makes it very enjoyable to watch. The music is good oldies which suits the age group. There is a nice soothing relaxation at the end of routine which has positive affirmations and is very good. Highly Recommended.",1289952000,5,682,4.666666666666667

8151005,1,B000JJS42S,"First of all, the model in the video looks like a waxed figure in a tourist museum.  The exercises, although advertised as such, have absolutely NOTHING to do with Pilates.  These is old fashioned, health club activities. They  list on the cover states that doing these activities will burn fat, replace muscle loss, (how do you loose your muscles?) stopping bone loss, again HOW?
The whole thing is one gigantic ""crock!""  DON'T BUY IT!!!",1265068800,,438,4.878378378378378
8151006,2,B000JJS42S,"The model/instructor, one, needs to loose the teeth, she grins stupidly through the whole exercise and two, it would be better if she were positioned in a real chair.",1254009600,2,166,4.758620689655173
8151007,5,B000JJS42S,"My parents are in their late 70's.  They are still pretty active, but my mom is still a little weak from a bout with cancer. I bought this set for my mom because she wanted something to help her regain her strength.  She was very pleased with it.  She liked it so much that she got my dad to do it with her.  They both really enjoy it.

I wish they had sold extra sets of the bands.  You have to by another DVD set in order to get the same bands the instructor uses in her DVD.  My dad got some standard bands with three different strengths and they work pretty well with the DVD, but it would have been nice to have two sets the same.",1242950400,6,635,3.9140625
8151008,4,B000JJS42S,I fell recently and broke my left ankle.  I will be recovering for the next six months.  I wanted to find video exercises that I could do from a seated chair position.  This video has what I want and I enjoy using it.  The resistance bands definitely help to work the arm muscles.  All parts of the body are exercised.  I also like the relaxation section of the video -- an additional benefit. I believe this video will help me maintain my muscle tone and well-being while I recover.  Older people can certainly do these exercises as well as anyone who is temporarily recovering from an injury that limits the ability to stand to workout.,1196985600,15,638,4.495652173913044
