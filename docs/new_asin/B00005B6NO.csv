My classes loved the book, so I ordered the video-they loved it, too.  It always inspired them to look up information on the black baseball league, to see the difficulties the black baseball players faced and overcame.  I kept plenty of background non-fiction books in my room for them to do so.  It is a wonderful story-but read the book, too.",1371945600,2,453,4.409638554216867
