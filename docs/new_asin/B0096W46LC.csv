5275114,5,B0096W46LC,I love the variety of the horse stories and enjoy watching them alone or with my grandchildren. A must have if you love horses.,1368576000,2,127,4.333333333333333
5275115,4,B0096W46LC,Bought these to watch with the grandkids and we all really enjoyed all but Riding Tornado. We started to watch it but the story line was to complicated for the little ones so we never did finish that 1 yet. We all really enjoyed Horse Crazy probably the kids new favorite horse movie. Good entertainment for the price. It also shipped very fast.,1367884800,2,345,4.492063492063492
5275116,4,B0096W46LC,Some of these reminded me of the Saturday morning shows I watched as a kid. I know im dating myself but Fury and My friend Flicka comes to mind. they are good stories with good meanings of life. Good for the whole family. I like horses and any horse lover would enjoy these movies.,1367107200,4,281,4.222222222222222

5275145,4,B0096W46LC,Riding Tornado and A Father's Choice were the best out of the four movies.  I am so glad I purchased this DVD because I enjoy watching these two movies more then once.  Enjoyed the reality they showed about people's lives.,1394928000,,222,4.525
5275146,5,B0096W46LC,Great family entertainment. There aren't too many movies you can watch with your kids that hold the adults interest as well but this movie 4 pack is it!

5275148,1,B0096W46LC,If you want to see some bad acting take a look at this DVD.  It is full of them.  Story lines were bad on three of the four. Don't waste your time or money on this one.,1390867200,,168,3.5135135135135136

5275164,3,B0096W46LC,"I had this DVD sent to an old friend who has always loved horses. Since she has had a couple of strokes, she had a hard time realizing the package was from me and has never told me if she ever looked at the movies. I'm sure when she does she'll enjoy them. I was glad to find something I could send her for such a good price.",1374105600,,325,3.7941176470588234
5275165,2,B0096W46LC,"I bought this DVD cuz it has 4 movie pack, and two of them worked with me whic are : Horse Crazy & Riding Ternado. That is all!!
it comes with 2 DVDs, each DVD has to side and there should be a movie for each side, however only one side is working from each DVD!!
I am so disappointed because I invested my money on actually 2 movies not 4 !!
I did my best to try the DVD on more than laptop and DVD player but it still the problem not working!
I would not recommend this product or even dealing with seller.

Thanks",1372204800,,516,3.8679245283018866

8537090,4,B0096W46LC,"These movies weren't really about the horse as much as it was about the people. I was expecting movies about the horses more. Still, they are okay to watch if you just enjoy seeing horses.",1502928000,,188,4.4
