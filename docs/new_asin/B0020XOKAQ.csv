3830731,4,B0020XOKAQ,"This DVD provides a series of very clear step-by-step overviews of actions to take in order to get the maximum out of LinkedIn as part of a job search.  Each step is clearly explained so that even people unfamiliar with LinkedIn or similar sites should be able to follow along without trouble.  As a bonus, author Jason Alba has a pleasant voice which makes the narration friendly and down-to-earth.

I have used several other LinkedIn resources, including Jason Alba's own book and blog, and I'm employed, not looking.  Yet I still found value in the tutorials, and I took several new actions to connect with people and improve my profile.

The only reason I give it four stars and not five is that I'm conflicted on the issue of value for the money.  I received the DVD as part of a promotion upon renewing my membership on Mr. Alba's JibberJobber.com, so I definitely got very good value for my money.  If you are just getting started with LinkedIn, and particularly if you have little time to devote to learning how LI works (or if you are less computer-savvy), you would also get a lot of value for the money; whether you would get enough for $50 depends on income and what you're trying to get out of LinkedIn.

For example, if you're in the LinkedIn target ""executive"" bracket and this DVD helps you get a job even one week faster, then it's well worth it.  Same for entrepreneurs who get a single contract through LinkedIn thanks to the help of these tutorials.  But if you're say, a young biologist or engineer or IT professional with many other pressing expenses and not that much income, this may be too expensive for you.  Similarly, if you're good at exploring applications on your own and have the time to do so, then you may not want to pay this much.

For my part, I did get good value but if I was just laid off and had to prioritize I would put the money into getting Mr. Alba's book ""I'm on LinkedIn -- Now What??"" in PDF format, and a few months' subscription to the premium version of JibberJobber.",1243728000,5,2019,4.4863387978142075
3830732,5,B0020XOKAQ,"I was lucky enough to get a free copy of Jason's DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it's geared towards job seekers, I found the information to be relevant for non-job seekers just trying to build their professional brand and grow their professional network. The DVD is laid out well and the format (video of a LinkedIn profile being updated and explained along with tips and tricks) allows the viewer to select sessions and skip around which is helpful if you're viewing the content as you update your LinkedIn profile.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in updating their professional brand using LinkedIn.",1242691200,,628,4.980952380952381
3830733,5,B0020XOKAQ,"I received this DVD in the mail yesterday, and watched it straight through. There is a lot of information packed in this disk. Jason does a great job of breaking the LinkedIn service down into bite size pieces.

I decided to watch it again, only selecting one or two parts to really focus on. I have a large number of connection but few endorsements. So I set out to increase my endorsement as Jason suggests. Over night I doubled my recommendations, and I endorsed just as many.

Next is Answers. I agree with Jason this is a treasure trove of advise and networking opportunities. The answers sections gives you the ability to show your subject matter expertise, which goes a long way when trying to build a good solid network.

Most of the information in the DVD isn't a secret, but Jason brings new ideas on how to use the features that already exist for LinkedIn users. You will find more opportunities to improve your LinkedIn connection base than ever. You need this DVD.",1242691200,,977,4.603448275862069

I walked through the DVD and even though I have read his book before and worked with LinkedIn for a couple of years, I found a few more tips and changed my profile once again.

Screen by screen with Jason giving clear advice, jobseekers will learn what to do and what not to do with LinkedIn and why. As a professional resume writer, I am excited to use this new tool with my clients and am recommending it on my website. The sooner job seekers understand the need for networking, the sooner they will find a job. LinkedIn is a great way to build your network and visualize it. Jason's new DVD is a great tool to help you do that.",1240012800,,848,5.235294117647059
3830735,5,B0020XOKAQ,"The biggest problem with the social networking sites is learning how to use all of the features offered.  Also, knowing what works and what doesn't is usually a matter of trial and error.

Jason Alba shows us in his new DVD what works and why and how to implement it.  He presents his material in a very easy to follow format with excellent examples.

I have recommened this to all my small business clients.",1240012800,,408,4.472972972972973
3830736,5,B0020XOKAQ,"If you're looking to grow your network ""organically"" and ""meaningfully"" using the web, LinkedIn just might the right tool for you.

But where do you start? Easy...with this DVD.

The DVD is a series of 16 short video clips, ranging from a three or four minutes up to 12 or 13 minutes. It covers all the major sections of LinkedIn along with some cool tips and tricks easily overlooked by most newcomers.

What I like best is I can review any of the segments quickly and easily and then jump onto LinkedIn and execute the concept.

Books on LinkedIn are fine; this is like having a private one-on-one tutorial in your home. Pretty cool!",1239667200,2,635,4.543859649122807
8348703,5,B0020XOKAQ,"After 14 years in corporate Human Resources, my career is now as an executive career coach and personal branding strategist. I also write executive career marketing materials, including LinkedIn profiles. For my clients, LinkedIn is a social networking imperative. Therefore, I must maintain 'specialist' knowledge that is relevant and applicable to my clients' needs. Just as LinkedIn is the top-ranking professional network in the world, Jason Alba's 'I'm on LinkedIn, Now What' is the absolute most comprehensive resource for not only creating a winning LinkedIn profile, but understanding just how the tool works and how to use the tool and get stunning results. Look no further than to Jason's knowledge within this cd and also his various blogs to gain and maintain the best knowledge about LinkedIn!",1324080000,,806,5.354330708661418
8348704,5,B0020XOKAQ,"My original LinkedIn profile was done using the online help from within LinkedIn. I thought it was really good until I viewed the first two segments of this DVD. It didn't take more than 20 minutes to realize my profile could be much better.

The first two segments, totaling 16 minutes in duration, taught me a few interesting points, but the third segment, ""Above the Fold,"" was where I knew the DVD would be worthwhile. The next two segments, ""Summary"" and ""Below the Fold"" were also packed with information.  Jason uses five real LinkedIn profiles to show good and bad points, occasionally showing what he has done on his own profile. Each point is reinforced with a text bar. While the text bar helps solidify the information, you will still want to take notes of what *you* need to do to your profile.

Most of the remainder of the segments are relatively short and show many specific ways to gain useful connections in your job search and get your information - your brand - before the eyes of those connections in a well-considered way. A welcome amount of LinkedIn etiquette is included. You'll frequently find yourself stopping the segment and making a quick change to your profile, rather than taking notes in many of these segments.

The last few segments show you how to export contacts (I hadn't known it was possible, prior to today), clean up the Excel file LinkedIn produces, and import it into Jason's JibberJabber product to track conversations and actions associated with each contact. I haven't yet looked at that product.

Because LinkedIn has become indispensable for the job seeker, knowing how to use it most effectively has become critical. This DVD will help you do that quickly and clearly and, I feel, for a reasonable price.",1320019200,,1754,4.813953488372093

I had an account for awhile and never used it but after following Jason's step by step explanations and suggestions, I now have a functional account.  The best part has been being a part of LinkedIn groups...something I never would have known about if I hadn't gotten my account set up to be more helpful and useful than it has been.  If you're just getting started on LinkedIn, this is definitely the resource you need.",1275782400,,498,4.450549450549451
8348708,5,B0020XOKAQ,"I would highly recommend this DVD its easy to understand and follow. Jason Alba goes thru several different profiles to show what works and what doesn't. I am somewhat of a computer nerd , but was overwhelmed when first logging onto LinkedIn. I would recommend this DVD for anyone embarking on a job search, whether your a new graduate or just looking to change jobs. I have recommend this to friends who are looking for a job and career counselors. I will definitely keep this in my personal library. I would also check out Jason Alba's website [...]
