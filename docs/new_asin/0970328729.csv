and quick to answer any questions I had with the product.

It is very informative, I am not a seamstress, but the step by
step process shown in the tape, is extremely easy to follow.

If you can locate this video and are interested in costuming,
but not a seamstress, this is the one to obtain.",1392163200,,357,4.378787878787879
7794165,5,0970328729,"The video is an absolute must for sewers from begging to professionals.  It not only tells you how to sew the bra and belt; it also provides tips for all types of sewing.  You can implement all the sewing techniques in just every day clothing.  It certainly helped me with a fancy dress I was making for festive occasions.
Each step is taught in language you can understand and it shows you as well.  I definitely want the rest of the videos in this series.",1015286400,12,457,4.341176470588235
