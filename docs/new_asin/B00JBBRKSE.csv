6351903,5,B00JBBRKSE,I'm 56 and ever since medical center came out I used to make sure I was home on medical center night. I love that show. I wish all the other seasons would come out quicker. This is one of my favorites shows where Joe Gannon had to save someone in each exiting episode. He was the hip Dr. Who would almost always pulled someone out of a crisis.,1400803200,4,343,4.0588235294117645

6351905,5,B00JBBRKSE,"I am so happy that they are finally  making the medical center series the last few years, I just wish I didn't have to wait a whole year for the next one to come out. I'm 50 years old and I have been in love with D.Cannon since I was a little girl. Can' t wait till I have the whole series",1398038400,10,289,3.661290322580645

6351909,5,B00JBBRKSE,This set is a great buy. It contains many of my favorite episodes. I get very nostalgic when watching these DVDs. I feel 30+ years younger and watching the DVDs makes exercising and cleaning the house almost enjoyable. It's also interesting to watch them to remember the clothes styles and social issues during the late 70s and  80s.,1420502400,,333,4.741379310344827

6351912,5,B00JBBRKSE,"As a huge fan of this show and the actors, Chad Everett and James Daly, I naturally LOVE this DVD set and have collected all the seasons which have been released.  The picture and sound quality are superb, better, even, than I remembered when I watched faithfully years ago.  I'm a very happy camper!  The seller was easy to work with, with incredibly fast shipping!  If you remember this series and enjoyed it back in the seventies, you will want to purchase this set.  You won't be disappointed!",1416787200,,497,4.6022727272727275

6351919,5,B00JBBRKSE,"I'm so happy to finally have Medical Center out on DVD; have been waiting a long while for this.  It was a good show on television.  The show took on many hard-hitting subjects like child abuse, spousal abuse, alcohol and substance abuse, bigotry both racial and religious...... I could go on.  The stories were well written and some of the stories could still be used today.",1408233600,3,375,4.651515151515151
6351920,5,B00JBBRKSE,"Holy cow! Talk about a trip back in time. I bought this as a birthday gift for my best friend. She and I used to watch ""Medical Center"" all the time when we were in high school (early 70's). How excited we'd be each week tuning in to see our idol, Chad Everett. My BFF will be so thrilled when she opens this. I can't wait to visit her and watch all these shows together.",1407974400,7,371,3.96
6351921,5,B00JBBRKSE,"Been a True Fan of Medical Center, I miss Chad Everret very much. Had such a Crush On THIS Gorgeous, Blue Eyed Doctor.  I have all 5 seasons and I am hoping to have 6 and 7 very soon. Thank you Warner Bros and Amazon.  Pease, rush season 6 and 7 ASAP.  Love Dr. Joe  miss him do mych, gone too soon. Thank you.",1406332800,,310,3.796875
6351922,5,B00JBBRKSE,"I just love this series. Chad Everette is perfect in this roll. Not only do you learn a very tiny bit of medicine, but you see social situations back in the late 60's and early 70's that we have mostly overcome. Shows like this brought them to the forefront during a tumultuous time.",1404777600,,283,4.3584905660377355
6351923,5,B00JBBRKSE,"This was when TV was worth watching. And the shows were good. And you had to watch for a good
55 Min to find out what was going to happen..
TV now is total trash. Sad to say...
Medical Center was and still is one great TV show.
P.S.  For the people that need CC. Closed Caption in English..
THIS DOES NOT HAVE IT...
If you want to watch Medical Center with CC Closed Caption on it...
You will need to go to Warner Archive online..
It's $9.99 a month + Tax. They have Medical Center seasons 1 & 2 on it now. And more on the way..
They have all kinds of Old TV shows and Movies also....
Check it out.....",1403308800,6,602,3.9344262295081966
6351924,5,B00JBBRKSE,"I don't care if the medicine is antiquated or the plots are repetetive, I LOVE Medical Center and will buy them as long as they make them!",1402531200,3,138,4.148148148148148
6351925,5,B00JBBRKSE,The Medical Center series was a ground-breaking show back when I was a teenager. I appreciate it even more now that I'm older that the series was one of the first to look at the relevant issues of the day. It's also amazing how many great guest stars the show featured!,1401580800,,269,4.294117647058823

8649573,5,B00JBBRKSE,"This isn't my favourite season of Medical Center. The color quality is not always good (too dark sometimes) but, the biggest flaw is that there isn't subtitle neither in english and for me sometimes is difficult understand everything. Said this, Chad Everett is a great actor and I love him and his character Dottor Gannon too. I'm in love with him since I was a little girl (a lot of time ago).who wouldn't  want Dr. Gannon as your physician and friend!?!
I give 5 stars for CHAD EVERETT and the series. The dvd's quality deserve 4 stars",1453766400,,538,4.546391752577319
8649574,5,B00JBBRKSE,"ALL of the Medical Center seasons are great.  I think Turner overpriced them, but I'm determined to have them all.  The series will always be special to me because it's well acted, directed, written and produced.",1447718400,,212,4.861111111111111
