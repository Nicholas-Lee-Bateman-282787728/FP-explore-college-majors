7160351,3,B00X797NTW,"As a fan, with the full collection of DVD's, this season was so disappointing. My collection stops here.
It is as though the story line cannot exist without repeats of all the things that went on over the years.
Yes, tying things into each other makes sense, yet, taking up so much show time to do it lacks imagination.
I felt, while viewing, if I had to watch that carousel spin one more time I would wretch, or when April, with all her drama, let loose Another over done drama face... Sheesh!
And then the absence of some of the more interesting team players...
Nope, Enough for me!",1473120000,4,584,4.416666666666667

7160417,3,B00X797NTW,"I have been an avid fan of the show since it first came out in 2005 and have been slowly watching it decline in greatness since after the plane crash. It started right before that, but got revived with the crash for a few episodes, and then continued it's decent. It's okay - the show is still okay, but okay isn't enough to stick around. Unless they pull some kind of miracle out of the air, season 12 may be the last. Rhimes hasty and not planned out death of McDreamy is probably this show's death stamp. I wish they hadn't done his death so hastily, it felt like a blow to me as a fan of ten years.

7160490,1,B00X797NTW,"So disappointing!!  As an avid viewer from the very first episode, I was already becoming disillusioned with the series as Season 11 started. Shonda Rhimes seems to love killing off characters, rather than giving them a happy departure from the series and I hate that. When I heard she was killing off Derek, I stopped watching the show and will never watch it again. The whole premise was the Mer-Der story line, without him, it would be totally boring  ( not to mention what would be the odds of THAT many doctors in the SAME hospital getting killed off in the ways they were?? - astronomical - it's totally unrealistic.  Seriously. ) . Not even Kevin McKidd would be able to fill in the HUGE hole her writing caused. I bought EVERY SINGLE SEASON of this show - until Season 11. For me, the show ended with Season 10 - and I thought the writing was getting pretty iffy even then. This show has turned into a train wreck! Oh, wait, maybe she'll write in a  train wreck into the new season too!  Just kidding  - this show is so over for me.  Seriously.",1444521600,3,1052,4.391752577319588

7160547,2,B00X797NTW,"As a devoted Greys Anatomy fan since it's inception I was reluctant to even order this DVD.  I wanted to add it to my collection, however with Seasons 1-10 so I reluctantly purchased it.  This show is so different than most series because of the characters speaking in the beginning and often throughout the show, about what is happening.  Very thought provoking.  I hated the way Derek Shepherd was removed from the program but Ms. Rhimes usually ends characters violently - she seems to have a need to do this - George, Mark, Lexi.  Izzie just walked away which I find interesting.  The only thing I didn't like is the DVD collection is shabbily boxed in cheap plastic which allows the DVDs to constantly fall out of the pockets and the containers to easily break and fall off the binder.  For what this series has done for ABC I would think they would have put a little more into production of the DVD.  But it's the season in which Derek dies and for that reason I kept it.  I don't know if I will be a returning viewer even though I have all Seasons - 1-11.  Just couldn't stomach the way Derek's death was told.",1442361600,6,1117,4.404878048780488
