8374711,3,B002N5KDYS,"I cannot rate this higher than the other reviewer Mr. Morrison, since I concur with most, if not all, of his observations on this live performance, meant to be an important event by all standards.
The choice of soloists is the major problem - I agree with Mr. Morrison on soprano Annette Dasch's vocal problems.  She does not have the requisite coloratura technique to tackle the arias of Gabriel and Eve, and most of the all time, she sings under pitch.  The phrasing and nuances are un-classical (i.e. not in the style of the era), though she owns a beautiful voice and lovely looks, for sure.
Christophe Strehl and Thomas Quasthoff both own all the requisite techniques and vocal capabilities, but both are not powerful enough for some of the pieces, especially Strehl who does not appear to be in the best vocal form in this performance.
Any rate, both Quasthoff and Strehl gave impeccable performances of Uriel, Raphael and Adam, and the former is most expressive as Adam in the last Part of the oratorio.
The venue is surely beautiful,and Fischer conducts a wonderful orchestra, with a very lovely flautist to boot.",1328400000,2,1121,4.803108808290156
8374712,5,B002N5KDYS,"Surely there is no more sheerly beautiful concert venue than the Haydnsaal at Esterhazy Palace! From the moment the camera takes you inside the Hall, with its magnificent painted decoration and, more importantly, its rich and warm acoustics, there is a special sense of occasion about this recording, Special it was, not only because this was the Hall where Haydn directed so many of his works, but it was made on the very day marking the 200th anniversary of the composer's death.

Special, too, is the playing of the Austro Hungarian Haydn Philharmonic Orchestra conducted so superbly and lovingly by Adam Fischer. Tempi and dynamics are crisp and beautifully controlled, with superb solo playing. I disagree with another reviewer about the excellent bass baritone Thomas Quastoff. The richness, the depth and fullness of his voice come over spendidly on my equipment. I find it especially interesting to watch his total commitment to the text whilst he is listening to the other performers. Christoph Stehl makes a splendid  Uriel. Whilst the lighter-voiced Annette Dasch would not be my choice for the soprano parts of Gabriel and Eve (who can forget Janowitz in Karajan's first BPO recording?), I continue to enjoy watching and listening to her on this DVD.

For the most part, the camera direction is excellent, especially some lovely foreground shots of Fischer with the hall in the background, and expert cutting to solo instruments. I do, however, find some of the `crane' movements from the back of the hall somewhat unnecessary. That, and the quirky monochrome egg-hatching cover for the DVD apart (surely the selling point for this disc is the hall itself and this should be on the cover rather than relegated to the back), this is a very fine ""Creation"".",1262390400,7,1767,5.023890784982935
8374713,3,B002N5KDYS,"The sense of occasion is palpable in this DVD of a performance of Haydn's 'The Creation' that took place on May 31, 2009, the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death. It occurred before a formally dressed capacity audience at the opulently rococo Schloss Esterhazy in Eisenstadt, Austria, where Haydn spent forty years of his life as Kapellmeister and court musician. The performance itself is an uneven affair in spite of its starry participants. Adam Fischer conducts his own Austrian-Hungarian Haydn Philharmonic, the orchestra he founded whose members are from the Vienna Philharmonic and various Budapest orchestras, and they are fine. The singers are bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff, soprano Annette Dasch, and tenor Christoph Strehl. Quasthoff's voice sounds a little shopworn and underpowered; he sounds best in the softer passages but when a forte is called for the voice becomes breathy. Dasch sounds more 19th-century operatic than classical oratorio and her rich voice is unfortunately under pitch a disturbing amount of the time. Strehl, on the other hand, is not only in good voice, he clearly has mastered the Haydn-era vocal style. The chorus is the Vienna Chamber Choir (Wiener Kammerchor) and they are in fine fettle. Their 'The heavens are telling' ('Die Himmel erzhlt die Ehre Gottes') is glorious. Fischer is a good Haydn conductor; his recordings of the complete Haydn symphonies with this orchestra have been lauded far and wide. Here he does a fine job of keeping things moving and obviously trusts his musicians, often simply smiling beatifically and nodding in time with arms folded. Tempi are crisp and nicely articulated. Thus I would love to recommend this DVD and could do so except for the contributions of two of the soloists. I haven't seen other DVDs of 'The Creation' and cannot make a recommendation for an alternative.
