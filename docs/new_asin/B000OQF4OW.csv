8325548,4,B000OQF4OW,"I liked Dr. Ravi & Mr. Hyde and recommend it highly. It is a good-natured comedy filled with medical, situational and pop culture humor in which Godse plays himself as a witty physician who pursues a single-minded dream of making ""a timeless, classic"" movie.

On a personal note, I believe the mark of a good movie, regardless whether it is a Hollywood blockbuster or an Independent film, is whether you wind up thinking about it afterward. For days I thought about some of the scenes and funny lines contained in Ravi. What impressed me is how filmmaker Dr. Ravi Godse, who loves word plays, delivered jokes to make deeper points that reveal insights into a physician's psyche. After all, doctors are people, too! But the thing I most will take away what filmmaker Dr. Ravi Godse created is how honest the movie came across.

Well done!",1198800000,,837,4.726027397260274
8325549,5,B000OQF4OW,"""Dr. Ravi & Mr. Hyde"" is an independent film written, produced, and directed by Dr. Ravindra Godse--who also starred in the movie. To watch the movie is to get a glimpse into the life of a man at a creative crossroads in his life. It is funny and quirky with a solid life lesson.

The plot of the movie is simple. A successful physician finds himself in the midst of a full-blown midlife crisis. Don't worry, parents, he doesn't turn to little red sports cars, drugs, or buxom blondes. His new passion is filmmaking.

He is driven to, as the opening theme proclaims, making a groovy movie. His family is inconvenienced, his associates avoid him, and his finances are diminished. There are plenty of jokes--ones that everyone will get and some that may be a bit over some folks' heads. It's a fast-paced movie. There were times when it became necessary to stop the DVD and replay a scene because we were still recovering from the previous punch-line.

Dr. Ravi's goal was to make a movie. His message was to do what you love--""...there is no shame in doing a thing as long as you do it honestly.""",1194134400,2,1095,4.52020202020202
8325550,1,B000OQF4OW,"Even with being independent, this film was still just a display of bad acting and no plot within site. I highly recommend to stay away from this film.",1192233600,3,150,4.392857142857143
8325551,5,B000OQF4OW,"what dr. RAVI has illustrated in this movie is the reality of a midlife crisis and has portrayed it with poignant and sharp comedy that is true because the characters are real-life and serve to bring home the thought process that Dr. Ravi goes thru when he realizes that he wants to make a movie and he goes down the path which seems during the process of watching the film from outside like a crazy and absurd thing to do...And yet when we are confronted with our own crazy ideas and go about getting these done, we are all similar to Dr. Ravi...
A must see movie and brings home a sense of accomplishment!!
Brilliant movie-making!!! Who says that creativity is not living your dreams!!",1190678400,,687,4.504
8325552,4,B000OQF4OW,"With the digital revolution today, any idiot with a desktop computer and a camcorder can make a movie. This is what Ravi Godse, the character, writer, and director of the independent comedy movie DVD Dr. Ravi & Mr. Hyde is told early on in the movie by one of his friends. The friend is right; Ravi is an idiot -his wife will vouch for it-- but he is not just any idiot, he is a very special, determined idiot.  Dr. Ravi And Mr. Hyde may not have the production values and acting skills of a Hollywood blockbuster comedy nor the smaller budget and lesser acting skills of most independent movies but it is better than many, many other independent films I have seen.

Dr. Ravi Godse has a midlife crisis and decides to make a movie. It is what Godse does with the premise, himself as a character, and the real life characters around him that make this independent comedy work.",1181174400,3,875,4.428571428571429
