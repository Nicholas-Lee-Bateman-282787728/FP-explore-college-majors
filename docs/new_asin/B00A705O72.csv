8547587,5,B00A705O72,"One thing I love about korean comedy is that it's clever comedy and they're not afraid to laugh at one's self.  It's not really slap stick, but it's smart.  Me and my mother discovered this film though Netflix, but they took it down.  Buying this for my mom for Mother's Day.  Watch it all the way through, you'll crack up at the silliness!",1399075200,3,340,4.349206349206349
8547588,4,B00A705O72,"While many filmmakers here in America are working on their sequels or ""reboots"" of past (i.e. OLD) ideas, in South Korea you have freaking awesome premises like this: what would happen if a big group of strangers, through freakish circumstances, all learn the FINAL ANSWER, to the question, of an upcoming game show that happens to be the most popular - and difficult - game show in the country ... one that NO ONE has yet to win, because the final question is always the stumper?

That's the premise of THE QUIZ SHOW SCANDAL, a comedy from Korea where each of these strangers knows the answer to the 30th question of a game show that's yet to be won (causing a HUGE jackpot build-up) ... then go berserk trying to prepare themselves to get ON the game show, getting their skills and knowledge up to par so they can not only get on ... but also get through the 29 questions they need to answer first, in order to win the jackpot?

I don't think I""m doing the film justice with my above plot outline, it's a WONDERFUL comedy/drama that really gives you insight into the various class levels in Korean society, as well as has elements of both strong drama (the film is actually very ""deep,"" at times) and physical comedy - and everything in between.

It's sad that a lot more people won't try more Asian films - and this is one where, if you aren't, you're missing out. A wonderful, original, and fun film that may also bring a tear or two to the eye.",1387238400,4,1449,4.399253731343284
8547589,2,B00A705O72,"I did not finish the movie.  It was very fast, lots of characters, different scenarios of the incident that happens, some lines were very funny to me and I did laugh several times, I did. However, I just could not finish it through to the end, I was too dizzy trying to follow and, therefore, I will never know how it ends. I am sorry to not give a better review because it appeared to have a thought out story line and a lot of effort went into the characters.  If I find others write reviews for this, I will read them and if you all write a review it is worth watching, I might be willing to give it another try and resume watching.",1382832000,,635,4.072
