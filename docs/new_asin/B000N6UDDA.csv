2758560,4,B000N6UDDA,"A good ""coming of age"" type film here with hints of The Graduate and American Beauty. The acting and direction are enough to keep you interested despite the somewhat hollow storyline.",1179014400,8,183,4.935483870967742
8175335,5,B000N6UDDA,"Great movie, closeted gay love. David Arquette is excellent.",1490486400,,60,5.777777777777778
8175336,3,B000N6UDDA,VERY slow start and at times confusing  The script is boring and at times makes no sense  Balthazar Getty tries his best to act the hell out of what he is handed but never quite manages to keep this views rapt attention. I bought it on the advice of a friend who has an obsession with Mr. Getty.  She extolled it was his best role yet.  After watching the movie I began to question her tastes!  I like David Arquette and he just manages on a string to save this movie from being a complete waste of money.,1480896000,,505,4.112244897959184
8175337,5,B000N6UDDA,I bought this movie because it was filmed in my hometown and I was there on set watching them produce the film.,1319155200,,111,4.090909090909091
8175338,1,B000N6UDDA,This whole movie is someone's daydream that should have never been put on tape. Any amateur could have done a video of this quality. The producers should be sued for the time wasted to watch this garbage. There is no redeeming moment in this video. DVD is already in the garbage. I would not insult my friends by passing this on to them.,1288483200,,337,4.365079365079365
8175339,1,B000N6UDDA,"Surprisingly bad performances by actors I previously thought better of. The plot could have been decent but all characters were unrealistic, over-the-top caricatures of stereotypes. Seriously. The dialog was also truly amiss. Overall, I really haven't seen a film as bad as this--and I've been streaming pretty bad free movies lately. This one I actually rented! I would only recommend this film to my worst enemies.",1271808000,,416,5.318181818181818
8175340,5,B000N6UDDA,this film surprised me.  thought it would put me to sleep but i ended up loving it!  any guy that has ever had a secret crush on a childhood male friend MUST see this movie.  the ending blows you away!,1188432000,2,201,3.975
8175341,1,B000N6UDDA,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  I do not know if the producers or who is responsible for the poor quality of this film.  The film is disjointed and pretends at being something it is not.  The only worth while aspect of this film is the four main actors.  Everything else about this movie is wortless.  Maybe it can serve as an example of what not to do as a driector.

The film never makes any clear decisions about its identity.  There is nothing at risk in this film though we are being prepared for the ending.  The Fast Bobbie character is wortless and makes me wonder if she's just a friend of the director he threw into the film.  There is not one metaphor for this film unless it was an attempt to sy that the only thing Taylor is going to steal of value is the daughter.  That he sees the true value of things.  I like that instead of lying to girl he falls for he just tells her the truth and there isn't a messy plot where he tries to tell her that his love is real though he had lied earlier.  But besides an antedote, the beating of the DJ and the burning out of the faces of a polaroid there's no real investment in the Ashley character to make us as an audience feel empathic towards what takes place.  In fact we barely are able to feel deeply about Taylor.
Overall this film is confused bout its identity and is a waste of anybody's time especially when there are a ton of great films out there.  You'd even be better off just rewatching any of your favorite films then watching this garbage.",1181952000,4,1526,4.163822525597269
8175342,4,B000N6UDDA,"SLINGSHOT explores the ups and downs of the lives of two boys, close friends since childhood, both from homes where they were unwanted, who made it through reform school and remain as a unit into an adult life as petty scam artists - living on the edge of crime and a life of desperate need for belonging.  The script by Jay Alaimo (who also directs), Matt Fiorello, Matthew Martin is gritty, full of humor and fine interchanges between the characters that manage to lift the story to a higher level of social statement than the usual 'crime buddies tales'.

Ashley (David Arquette) and Taylor (Balthazar Getty) are the borderline 'bad guy duo' who have decided to move their scam of charming lonely housewives while robbing them to Fairfield County, Connecticut: the scam is that Taylor seduces the women while Ashley robs the preoccupied women. One of Taylor's hits is bored and married Karen (Julianna Margulies) whose second marriage is passionless making her an easy target for Taylor's charms.  All goes according to plan until Taylor realizes he cares for Karen and Karen (with a lot of encouragement from girlfriend Emma - Joely Fisher - for an affair) falls for Taylor.  The nightly signal from Karen that the coast is clear for Taylor to join her in bed is a light from her bedroom, yet when that goes on one evening, Taylor meets Karen's young daughter April (Thora Birch) in her mother's bedroom and barely escapes discovery when Karen and husband come home early.  April at first mocks Taylor's attraction to her mother, but gradually the two bond - the first time that Taylor has been close to anyone except Ashley.

While Taylor is 'prepping' Karen for robbery Ashley is mixing with their 'crime bosses' Dickson (Michael Janik) and  Fast Bobby (Svetlana Metkina)  and feels the threat to perform.  Several incidents lead to the final confrontation between Taylor, now enamored with April, and Ashley, who finally comes to grips with the fact that he is love with Taylor.  The long-standing duo hits a schism and how that resolves provides a disturbing ending.

The four leads - Arquette, Getty, Margulies, and Birch - offer performances that are more than simple outlines of disconsolate characters: they inhabit their roles, finding cores of credibility that allow the viewer to understand the needs and fears of these isolated people.  The cinematography by Paul Daley is appropriately grimy and the film editing by Jim Rubino takes Jay Alaimo's direction to a more cohesive whole.  While not a great movie by any means, it is a touching character study of what happens to unwanted kids whose lives are dependent on each other in a world that rejects them.

8175343,5,B000N6UDDA,"A wonderfully filmed production of a deep friendship between two men and their eventual separation with excellent acting - Birch, Getty, Arquette, and Margulies.  Scenes were unique - both humorous and poignant.",1180051200,13,211,5.59375
8175344,5,B000N6UDDA,I heard about this movie and I am so glad i bought it.  The first 10 minutes truely set the pace of this movie with its smartly written dark humor.  An intersting cast that is cleverly pulled together into a thoughtful film.  David arquette shines as a true actor under the good direction of Jay Alaimo...,1179619200,12,305,4.410714285714286
