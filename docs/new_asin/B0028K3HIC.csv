8356376,1,B0028K3HIC,"This was like an old home video of a man and his wife touring Kenya with no knowledge of the country or its rich culture. Very boring, dated, and bad quality.",1283472000,,158,4.129032258064516
8356377,1,B0028K3HIC,"I appreciate ""off-the beaten path"" exploring, but this did not make me want to go to Fiji.  It is a dream of my husbands.  I guess we will be sticking to the resorts.",1268092800,,166,4.0
8356378,5,B0028K3HIC,"Remarkable and truly inspirational; on this journey we follow Barry and Corinne as they see and experience the wonders of Japan. We learn that Corinne is visiting Japan with the anticipation of tracing her family roots. We empathize as she overcomes a deep-felt resistance of what to expect when meeting unknown relatives because she does not speak their language. We watch as her fears are quickly replaced with sheer joy when they meet for the first time, proving that blood is thicker than water! As usual with all Barry and Corinne's travel DVD's there is plenty of adventure and amazingly beautiful scenery presented in the down-to-earth charming style associated with all their travel DVD's, but unique to this particular one is the profound message that it delivers about the unconditional love of family ties. This one will touch your heart as well as give you a great insight into Japan and the Japanese lifestyle.",1262476800,,923,5.0
8356379,1,B0028K3HIC,"At the beginning of the DVD There is a warning that this is an amateur production about real people.  Great, you get the warning after they've got your money.  Also, it's not really a video, it's just a slide show mostly about the family of the producers of the DVD. And the photography isn't all that good.  There are better slide shows on Flickr for free.",1252886400,2,357,4.378787878787879
8356380,5,B0028K3HIC,My family and I are planning a trip to Kenya so I decided to buy this DVD. It was Fantastic. We loved it. There was alot of information given but what we loved most was the fun and excitement they had on their journey and we could imagine it being us.,1246060800,,251,3.9411764705882355
