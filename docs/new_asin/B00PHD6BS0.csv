6802796,5,B00PHD6BS0,Definitely worth the money. Wish there was another series.,1426204800,,58,5.555555555555555
6802797,5,B00PHD6BS0,"A refreshing new look to the world of the wild and how people and the wild can co-exist improving both the land, the wild animals, and still support people--even to the extent of reclaiming desert land and transforming it into livable land for people and wild animals.  Discovered a new antelope that I've never heard of nor seen...antelope head and horns, but with an elephant seal nose on the male antelope.",1426032000,,409,4.76056338028169
6802798,5,B00PHD6BS0,"An outstanding series of documentaries following a scientist, M. Sanjayan, as he explores various ecosystems and lifeforms, particularly in how we as humans interact with them. The mistakes of the past and present are shown, but also solutions for problems we have caused, giving a measure of hope for the future. The condition of the Aral Sea is disturbing, to say the least, in one documentary, as is the Colorado River's outlet (or lack thereof), though there is some good news on that front. Sanjayan's infectious enthusiasm makes the series work so well as a whole. He's an engaging host and terrific source of information. The cinematography is spectacular as well.",1425772800,,671,5.054054054054054
6802799,5,B00PHD6BS0,"This is a really must see nature documentary series that is right up there with my all time favorite nature programs (and I have watched A LOT.)  The series presents a wide variety of ideas and conservation success stories which in this time of consistent bad news about the condition of our wonderful planet Earth really renews one's spirit and love for the endless beauty of nature.  Dr. Sanjayan is a very engaging narrator and truly passionate about conservation and his enthusiasm is very infectious about how we as humans can certainly do the wrong thing but at times can wonderfully do the RIGHT thing by our planet.  And the photography is spectacular; so many scenes of amazing animals and people that coexist and work to live with and conserve them for the common good of themselves as well as the ecological health of the planet.  I can't recommend this nature series, it is truly wonderful, fascinating and inspiring.",1424476800,3,929,4.823899371069182
6802800,5,B00PHD6BS0,"This series offers a beautifully balanced and nuanced conversation about humans and our relationship with the natural world. I highly highly recommend.  A hopeful message indeed and an absolute must see .
  A tremendous effort and passion has obviously been spent  for taking the time to rewrite this crucial and important  story .",1424044800,2,331,5.169811320754717
6802801,5,B00PHD6BS0,"A spectacular series which gives me hope that man will finally stop destroying the natural world and work with it, and the BLU RAY is indeed HI DEF and not 480i, this page is supposed to be about what is purchased here, not what was seen on a PBS station, however here in Los Angeles it is being broadcast in 1080 HD",1423699200,7,316,4.112903225806452
6802802,5,B00PHD6BS0,"Unlike the producers of this spectacular documentary, I did not have to visit thirty countries and film for seven years to see the final product although I had to wait few grueling months for the screening date but at least, finally I can really say wow, wow, wow...

This is a documentary about Planet Earth and its players from the little grazers to predators and the impact of all on planet earth with humans as the supreme specie. One thing that the producers have done which is not common in wildlife documentaries is that every time that they visit a new valley, a new part of the world, the location's name appears for few seconds on the screen. Without the need of closed caption, without any confusion one can write down and do more search and more study about that particular location, from its wildlife to habitants as they find it necessary which truly opens up many doors to more exciting studies. This is unlike any other documentary I have ever seen and I continuously watch documentaries about wildlife and planet earth, the passion of my life. Although the purpose of this documentary is to showcase the conservation attempts in areas where human activities has brought destruction to nature and wildlife with human activities, it demonstrates how everything on this planet earth is interconnected with each other and hence once one part of the equation suffers regardless of the reasoning, such pain transforms to every aspect of that environment from its species to nature, directly or indirectly. It may have taken centuries to impact our environment just because of less human population and activities but these days the impact of human actions are far reaching and greater on its habitant and nature unfortunately. We humans as the dominate specie need to protect what this planet earth has to offer if we want to see any prosperous human society in future. Understanding how we are connected and more importantly how we are protected by the natural world is a complex issue but a pure necessity and a survival issue since we humans are not separate from nature, we are part of nature.

It is admirable what some societies endure in order for them to preserve nature in comparison to some states especially like California in the U.S. where they can not even control the run off and the trash that is being dumped in Pacific Ocean. These poor societies do not have the financing or even the higher education like Californians do but they have the common sense of valuing and protecting their environment unlike the movie stars who only care for their fame and fortune, with no constructive measures in protecting the environment that they happen to be living in. What an absolute disgrace... National Geographic has done a superb job creating a very educational and informative documentary, with a superb narration and out of this world cinematography in many magical locations that it is going to take me very long time to visit and soak in, not to mention the wildlife that I will have to watch and watch, over and over again. A must see documentary. This documentary will truly blow your mind in regard to how connected every single spec of Universe is and why we should care. Mind boggling information. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1423008000,18,3250,4.833034111310592
6802813,5,B00PHD6BS0,"This should be REQUIRED viewing in every school in the world! Publishers: Put SPANISH SUBTITLES on this asap! There are between 400 million and 500 million Spanish speakers in the Americas, and around the world. There is a serious lack of good DVDs on nature, conservation, and science in Latin America, and a HIGH interest among students, teachers, conservation organizations, and even government. FACT: EVERY DVD player sold in Panam (where I do volunteer conservation/education work) plays both System 4 AND System 1 . With subtitles, this would sell very well in Latin America, AS IS (no transcription to System 4 required)!",1446163200,,628,5.166666666666667

The narrator is an ecologist and he keeps finding out that everything we were once taught has to be unlearned and wow we are learning more from primitive tribes about how to turn around the destruction of environment that we have accomplished in the past.",1437782400,2,357,4.774193548387097
6802815,5,B00PHD6BS0,This series is amazing. It is so inspiring and uplifting. Dr. Sanjayan is a personable scientist showing the efforts of scientists around the world who are in remote areas making a difference. My daughter loved it and learned a lot. We also had the opportunity to meet him and hear him speak and he was amazing then too!,1435190400,2,320,4.5344827586206895

6802839,5,B00PHD6BS0,"Everyone on the planet should see this.  It's REALLY something special.  There have been other series that show nature in all its splendor- besides being breathtakingly beautiful, stunning, THIS one also celebrates human beings as integral to the diverse panoply of life.  It sings, it soars.  Satisfying on every level- it takes ineffable realities and reifies them in your head AND heart.

The scope of the subject matter- the look at complex ecosystems- the vast array of life, the geology, the interactive nature of systems on our planet- is simply incredible.  How did anyone think they could even capture it?  The breadth, the implications, are staggering- awe inspiring.  I can't think of enough superlatives to describe it- I found it hopeful, inspiring and uplifting in the extreme, sublime.  All the more amazing because it doesn't shy away from the harsher and more savage aspects of life- yin and yang.

From the small, personal and particular to the global- the series celebrates how minute changes can have profound, restorative and far-reaching effects, how nature (especially apprehended, aided by individuals with foresight and eyes undimmed by ""conventional thought"") seeks a harmonious balance, homeostasis and has innate capacities for self-righting, healing.  We are part of that.  And as a fan of science that breaks new ground, thinks outside the box, I glory in people who come along and see things in a new light.  The filmmakers do, and have crafted a valentine to individuals and people around the globe who do too.  Ultimately the series is a celebration of what it means to be human and the innate capabilities of us all, of nature itself.

In an age fraught with dire warnings of global warming, vanishing species, widespread drought, famine and starvation, and human beings often characterized as the scourge of the planet, this series offers an alternate, optimistic view- solutions, what we've done RIGHT.  Besides the beauty and majesty, the vision, perhaps what I most delighted in was how counter-intuitive (and sometimes ""accidental"") many ecological solutions are.  You know the old chestnut in chaos theory about the effect of a butterfly flapping its wings in Bolivia producing a hurricane in the tropics?  Real examples abound of big changes resulting from small, seemingly insignificant human acts.  Mighty oaks from small acorns grow.

Satisfying on every level- intellectually, aesthetically, spiritually- you owe it to yourself to see this- DON'T MISS IT!",1427587200,,2500,5.249370277078086

8687939,5,B00PHD6BS0,"This is an extraordinary documentary with a positive approach to the issue of the environmental decline of the planet.

The narrator M. Sanjayan with a PhD in biology shows evidence it is perfectly possible to restore nature to its original natural balance. That the pollution of water and land, rivers' damning, deforestation, fracking, open mining, plastic pollution of oceans, and over-fishing are responsible for desertification, decay of oceans, lakes and rivers and the decline of water and land wildlife.

Obviously this  film  was not crafted to generate guilt but instead by solid evidence the man proves there is reason for hope for both the planet and for animal and human life. By traveling to North and South America, Europe, India, Africa,  Asia and Australia he shows, by partially opening or totally eliminating river dams, how humans working in harmony with fauna and flora are successfully restoring the fish supply, bringing deserts back to life, and  life where desolation and emptiness were before.

This is a presentation that is highly recommended.",1455148800,,1071,5.264705882352941
8687940,3,B00PHD6BS0,For pure enjoyment I like Art Wollfe's Travel to the Edge much better. A New Wild did provide a couple of new angles on human's ability to live with and support the natural environment that birthed us.,1454025600,,201,4.45945945945946
8687941,5,B00PHD6BS0,"I hardly ever take the time to write reviews on Amazon unless I truly feel an item really warrants the proper recognition.

Earth: A New Wild definitely his this mark.

I have never been so blown away and enamored by a nature documentary before. I originally caught an episode while browsing channels one evening, and immediately ordered it on Blu-Ray the next day. What Dr. M. Sanjayan is able to achieve in this documentary series is quite remarkable. He's able to take the broad and commonly-held cynical view of humans and our effect on the world, and completely turn it on its head through captivating stories of humans and nature helping each other out. This is not an easy task, and yet somehow Sanjayan does it here through his own giddy excitement at each turn.

This is a documentary series I've already shared with my own household of roommates and will soon be passing on to friends and family. In a time where optimism about the world is bleak, Earth: A New Wild comes out of the blue and presents true hope for the future of humans and nature.",1453334400,,1057,4.582010582010582
