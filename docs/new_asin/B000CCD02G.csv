2456107,3,B000CCD02G,"As the previous reviewer noted, there's little new in this program -- but it does have one of the last times we saw James Doohan, the beloved ""Mr. Scott"" of zillions of trekkies like me.  It is worth having on that basis alone, as the UFO information is quite general and nothing we probably haven't heard before.",1233014400,2,313,4.491228070175438
2456108,2,B000CCD02G,"We get so many like this. Although the DVD version of this documentary ""UFOs Above & Beyond"" (narrated by James Doohan) was released in 2003, it features very little new information. There are few new ideas here. It rehashes classic events (e.g., ancient cave paintings depicting alien craft and entities) as well as more contemporary sightings and oddities (such as events seen over Phoenix, Miami and Las Vegas), but none of this is researched in any meaningful manner. It treds a safe path betweeen provocation and revelation by dealing dramatically with very little outside a few images. These are the very same stories (such as Roswell) we have all become familiar with over the past 40 years.

The one single exception which makes this documentary stand out are perhaps the moon shots, photos of UFOs on and around the moon and the space shuttles. This may be worth viewing the DVD of itself.

In conclusion, although there is some new footage, essentially there is very little new information for ufologists in this DVD.  I believe that this documentary is typical in its approach to this sensitive topic--almost child-like, as if the information being presented is really new and fascinating when in reality it is not. Who or what is obfuscating serious research into this earth shattering phenomenon is simply not known by most of us at this time. Since so many UFO documentaries like this are ""safe,"" it makes one wonder to what degree researchers in general have reached that ""firewall"" of information beyond which they simply cannot go. If you've never heard anything at all about UFOs, this documentary might be one of several you would choose to start with.",1198540800,15,1671,4.93950177935943

2456159,4,B000CCD02G,"The films, photos (especially those dating before the advent of CGI and photoshopping capabilities), and videotapes herein from all over the world seem legitimate. Yes, most of us have seen them before, but some I haven't seen some of them, and I've seen a lot of these type stories. Lots to see and process here. The Mexico City UFO event seems undeniable; too many films, photos, and eyewitnesses exist to deny that.
  Bob Lazar: he seems to be prevaricating when he speaks; watch his eyes as they shift to the left--a sign of lying. He has no provable scientific credentials. But he can prove, at least on paper, that he worked for the government; his name was listed in an Area 51 phone book, and one guy who did work there, said that Bob worked there, too. But if he's revealing all these top secrets, why hasn't he been arrested? Is the government just going to forget about it? If so, then why have the nondisclosure contracts at all? And don't even bring up his illegal activities, like being involved in prostitution.
  In sum, I would watch this video, which has some validity and some doubtful sections. And seeing ""Scotty"" makes it even more worth your time.",1462060800,,1170,4.63768115942029

The elongated cigar was so timeless and really added a since of adventure next to the wild hair schemes. The lead scientist has a truly charming personality and I really enjoyed his iconic style.

2456189,2,B000CCD02G,"I tend to agree with the other reviewers. Even if you believe aliens from other worlds are visiting ours (and crashed at Roswell), this documentary probably won't thrill you, unless you are a great fan of James Doohan (Scotty from Star Trek). It's badly edited, for starters. Nor does Doohan sound very excited about narrating it.

Personally, I'm not skeptical to the UFO phenomenon as such, but I'm a definite non-believer when it comes to the ETI hypothesis. UFOs Above and Beyond gives too much credence to George Adamski, Bob Lazar and Majestic-12, which I think have all been thoroughly debunked by now. I also wonder how much of the supposedly sensational footage of alien craft shown in the production have been double checked? The real meltdown comes after about 20 minutes, when Doohan (or perhaps his script writer) express his belief in theface on Mars.

Good grief.

In the end, I give UFOs Above and Beyond two stars qua documentary, but perhaps three as cultural studies...",1446940800,,988,4.904191616766467

2456221,3,B000CCD02G,there is little to no newinformation here. What'sworse is they seem to endorse known frauds and hoaxers like Bob Lazar and Billy Meier and the Guardian hoax.

2456223,4,B000CCD02G,This documentary is a bit dated but has some of the best footage of UFOs I've ever seen.  It is fun to have 'Scotty' (James Doohan) from the original Star Trek series narrate the video.  Aw...I know you're thinking...should I take the time?  Go ahead...it's a bit of a blast from the past!,1441152000,,289,4.415094339622642

2456239,2,B000CCD02G,"Like several other reviewers, I only watched this documentary because it was hosted by James Doohan.  Having watched it now, I would say that James Doohan is the only reason you would want to watch UFOs: Above and Beyond.  I am convinced that Earth is being (and has long been) visited by extraterrestrials, but this video doesnt make a very strong case for UFO reality.  Some of the photo and video evidence may have been presented here for the first time, but virtually all of it is familiar to anyone with an interest in ufology today.  Indeed, a lot of it goes back to the 1950s and 1960s.  Those types of grainy images are far from conclusive, and you don't get a lot of time to study anything you're seeing.  It appears obvious that the makers of this documentary tried to cram in as many images as possible; these things come at you faster than the chocolate came at Lucy and Ethel on that classic episode of I Love Lucy.  More unfortunate still is the fact that two of the few times the video slowed down to focus on a single witness, the subjects were Bob Lazar and Billy Myers, neither of whom are given any credibility among ufologists.  I really cant recommend this documentary to anyone apart from James Doohan fans.  Its not going to convince anyone that UFOs are real.",1435795200,,1283,4.495689655172414

2456271,1,B000CCD02G,Very weak. It features well known and exposed hoaxers like Bob Lazar and several others. It also features a lot of well known and exposed images and does so in a machine-gun type fashion. It's an unfortunate waste of time.,1431216000,2,222,4.575

2456276,2,B000CCD02G,"I bought this ""documentary"" 4 years ago for less than 10$. I admit, I bought it because it was cheap but also because I thought it would be a real documentary, featuring both skeptics and believers. However this is not a documentary: It's 45 minutes of so-called ""UFOs"" and the host of the show automatically assume that all of these ""UFOs"" are from another world. The Host also seems to believe that Bob Lazar is legit, when in fact most people think that Lazar is a fraud. In other words this ""documentary"" is for believers only, for people who see Ufology as a fun phenomena instead of seeing it as a serious phenomena. I think it's really annoying that the host/people who have produced this documentary think that all UFOs are from another world when in fact we have no evidences that these are really Alien crafts. If you want to watch a bunch of random ""UFO"" footage then buy this DVD, but if like me you want only serious documentary in your collection then don't buy this DVD.",1308960000,,985,4.5083798882681565
