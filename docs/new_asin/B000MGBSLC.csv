2731176,4,B000MGBSLC,"The original title for this series was, I believe, called ""Decades."" It does a reasonable job of capturing the tempo of that time and is presented in the style and format of the period. It is an interesting look, overall.",1207526400,,221,4.55
2731177,3,B000MGBSLC,"It was thorough but it tended to focus more on the turbulence and conflicts of the 60's and not the wild and wonderful side. We need both for sure but the 'wild and wonderful' was overshadowed.  I had this silently showing at a 60's party while a whole lot of other things were going on and some of the graphic nature just didn't work for that kind of venue.  I guess when I read the word ""fabulous"" I was equating it with more of the fun side.  (I wish there was a video of the 'fun' side of the 60's.)  Having lived through the turbulence and violence of the 60's I am very aware of the sacrifices people made in civil rights, during the Vietnam war, governing this country, speaking up and moving forward in music, inventions, space etc.  Like I said, it was thorough.  It just wasn't what I expected in totality.  Maybe the title should be changed?",1188518400,,852,4.320754716981132
2731178,5,B000MGBSLC,"Wow, was this fun stuff!  A breezy, 70's TV look at the prior decade, fresh from  having experienced it!  A lot of pop culture obscurities, (I love LBJ lifting his beagles by the ears...) you'll probably end up watching the whole thing in one sitting.  Enjoy seeing clean cut American kids become angry, long haired radicals in the space of 10 viewing hours!  Our parents were nuts!

Enjoy!",1180310400,,390,4.661764705882353

8168642,5,B000MGBSLC,The Fabulous Sixties is narrated by Peter Jennings who along with Morgan Freeman and John Facenda(NFL Films) in my opinion are the top three narrators ever. Mr Jennings voice and description of the events of the 1960s is flawless in this DVD and that in itself earned 5 stars. There were unsatisfactory elements of this documentary such as the silly long winded Psychologist in the 1964 section explaining why the Beatles were so popular and the 1969 section which half of it repeated events earlier in the decade and did not mention the Manson Killings. The 1966-68 sections perfectly matched the events and emotions of a topsy turvy era and with the great Peter Jennings narration easily off set the dull or repeated sections of this documentary.,1497484800,,748,4.897637795275591
8168643,5,B000MGBSLC,"Incidentally, this is NOT Peter Jennings as widely misinformed. According to the credits-roll at the end of each program, the narrator is a Canadian broadcaster, Harvey Kirck.",1467676800,,175,5.518518518518518

8168645,1,B000MGBSLC,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fabulous-Sixties/dp/B000MGBSLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fabulous Sixties</a>I thought the production quality was poor (some attempt at a digital clean-up would have been a good thing) .  Some episodes repeated themselves - 1962 was 61' all over - repeated and so too, was 65!
It's a rather jaded and cynical look back at what was a most exciting decade - it wasn't all that bad and gloomy.  Peter Jennings commentary, for the most part, comes across as snide and cynical.  There is a few good items amongst the dross or endless 'race riots', 'war', more 'race riots' and .... riots.",1305590400,,662,5.73469387755102
8168646,4,B000MGBSLC,"Narrated by Peter Jennings, ""The Fabulous Sixties"" is a DVD set consisting of ten episodes, one for each year from 1960 to 1969.  The series recalls the most important events of the decade, such as the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Great Society, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, the 1969 Moon landing, and the assassinations of JFK, MLK, and RFK.  The DVD set also looks back at some sports stories and cultural events such as the arrival of the Beatles, Woodstock, and the hippie movement at Haight-Ashbury.  This series seemed more tendentiously liberal than its successor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sensational-70s/dp/B000IU3XSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sensational 70s</a>, but if you can get past that bias, this series is a solid look back at a pivotal decade.",1283817600,,846,5.806451612903226
8168647,4,B000MGBSLC,"This is a straightforward 'how it was' collage documentary of the 1960's.  It worked well for my ninth grade history class as an overview of the 'decade of change' and what happened.  Having lived the sixties as a teenager, today I continue to be amazed at the concentration of societal evolutionary events.  The Peter Jennings narration is matter of fact and unbiased. I am happy it was available for my students.",1243036800,,414,4.802816901408451
8168648,4,B000MGBSLC,"THE FABULOUS 60S DVD set isn't bad for what you get. There are four DVDs with 10 episodes (3 on DVDs #1 & #2 and 2 on DVDs #3 & #4) on them. Each episode is dedicated to a year in the 60s and starts with 1960 and ends with 1969. Each episode runs about 40-50 minutes.

I didn't have a problem with the footage. In fact, I found it acceptable considering that most was taken from news footage or some other sources and probably wasn't meant to be preserved. There are some audio glitches that's present on the original source footage, but they're very small and hardly noticeable.

There's a lot of footage with good natural sound, and there are wonderful images of everyday life as well as celebrities, politicians, and other people and happenings of the 60s.

I deducted the half-star because there is no ""play all"" feature, so you must go episode by episode. And there's no menu card or insert so you don't really know what's on the DVDs until you put them in your player. And there's no special features.

Another tiny problem was with the Peter Jennings* narration. On the first episode (DVD#1--1960), the narration is just a bunch of headline slogans and sometimes they come off sounding like snide comments. This also happens on the DVD #3--1967 episode. I don't know why the writers, at the time, wrote those two episodes like that? I almost didn't continue on with episode two because of that, but I'm glad I did. It got better.

Again, not too bad for the price.

*UPDATE 07/05/16
According to another Amazon Customer the narrator is NOT Peter Jennings, as stated on the mislabled DVD cover, but Harvey Kirck.",1225411200,,1618,4.581314878892734
8168649,1,B000MGBSLC,"This DVD is pathetic by way of sound.  The video is poor.  The titling is second rate.  It runs maybe six hours with perhaps thirty minutes of good viewable images.

The writing for it is also inferior.  In sum,  it is terribly produced.",1211241600,,237,4.395348837209302
