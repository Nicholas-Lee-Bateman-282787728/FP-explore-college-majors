8025482,1,B0002B55H0,This Urban DVD is not the best and it is yet another low-budget video that you only need to watch it once.  This is designed for a specific uneducated viewer.,1367798400,,158,4.266666666666667
8025483,2,B0002B55H0,"I thought Fulgazi was some underground group like Anthrax or Meat Beat Manifesto.  Well, anyway, I would usually give hood flicks like this one star, but I give this two.  It was vaguely funny.  ""What's that smell!?  Did you dookey!?""  ""I don't know!""  This movie is real derivative: I saw bits of ""Friday,"" ""Set It Off,"" and other movies in it.  Still, it's only about 68 minutes long, so you don't have to suffer for 90 minutes as usual.  The Spanish subtitles were 4 seconds off.  If I character said, ""Hello, N-word!"", ""!Hola, amigo!"" would only appear on the screen 4 seconds later.  At one point, a person says, ""ice"" as in jewels, but the translator must have heard it wrong 'cuz he or she wrote ""ojos,"" Spanish for ""eyes.""  This DVD got its translating done at the dollar store!  There's even a vague, positive, anti-violence message at the end.  And of course, it had a tacked-on, not-even-necessary love story in it.",1306281600,,926,4.6419753086419755
