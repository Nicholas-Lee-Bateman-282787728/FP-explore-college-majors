2263317,3,B00094ARHS,"Bill and Ted I & II plus a bonus dvd of extras.  Not a bad deal for the price that Amazon.com give you.  However these movies are for the lovers of the corny 80's genre.  I myself can't get enough of them, but it's definitely not for everyone, just those of us who know about it.",1142294400,4,279,3.9464285714285716
2263318,5,B00094ARHS,"The other reviewer is relying on childhood memories of the two films.  Excellent Adventure is a great film, and when the second film came out, it did not have the time machine and the historical dudes from the first movie, so it felt too different than the first.  Not many people cared for it, but I have been showing these films to my nieces and nephews for years now and the complete consensus is that the second film is a better film than the first.  The writing is just as good and the film moves along quite well.

The two films feel quite different, but this is a good thing.  They did a time travel movie already, so they went on to something else.  It works!

Bogus Journey is a very funny film that needs to have a second look by fans of the first.  Just keep in mind that it is not about time travel and historical dead dudes.

I have both the original DVDs, but I am reordering this collection for the extras.

Extras on these discs include:

The Original Bill & Ted: In Conversation With Screenwriters: Chris Matheson & Ed Solomon

The Most Triumphant Making-Of Documentary

Score! An Interview With Guitarist Steve Vai

Hysterical Personages: Biographies of Nine Historical Dudes and One Babe Dressed as a Dude

One Sweet and Sour Chinese Adventure To-Go - Episode of the Cartoon

They are the type of movies where you can just enjoy them for what they are aND NOT HAVE TO FIND SOME HIDDEN MEANING OR A ""MORAL"". Bil and Ted have to be two of the most unlikly heroes around, but they are so good-natured that you can't help but love them!

2263586,5,B00094ARHS,"I was very excited when I got this DVD set for Christmas 2006!
It was all I hoped for, because I have loved watching the Bill and Ted movies before!

Anybody should know who Bill and Ted are;

Bill and Ted are two most excellent dudes that go on time travel adventures! Bill S. Preston Esquire is played by Alex Winter and Ted 'Theodore' Logan is played by Keanu Reeves!

In Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Bill and Ted have to pass their history report in high school. On top of that, Ted's dad is threatening to send him to military school. Then they'll never start their band, Wyld Stylns, talk about bogus!

Never fear dudes, the time traveling dude Rufus is here; played by the comedian George Carlin. Rufus helps Bill and Ted them out by letting them travel through time in a time traveling phone booth... so they can collect historical figures, like Napoleon, Joan of Arc, and So-crates for their history report.

It's an outstanding movie, but don't leave out Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.

In the sequel; Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, Bill and Ted are trying to get their band, Wyld Stylns into the Battle of the Bands. On top of that, they want to propose to their princesses! But trouble is a foot, in the disquise of Evil Robot Bill and Ted; who have orderes from a non-henious dude named De Nomolos to kill Bill and Ted.

Bill and Ted wind up plumeting to their deaths, and now have to travel through hell. Bill and Ted will have to unlist the help of the Grim Reaper, but first have to beat him in a board game. They come back to life, and then with the help of a martian scientist, Bill and Ted comfront the evil robot Bill and Ted, and also De Nomolos at the Battle of the Bands.

This DVD set comes with both movies, with the best high definition sound enhancement. On top of that, there's a most excellent bonus disc with special features.

Some of these special features include; a conversation with the creators of Bill and Ted, a how to speak like Bill and Ted, an interview with Steve Vai who worked on the soundtracl's score, an air guitar session with two air guitar professionals, and my personal favorite... the debut of the first Bill and Ted cartoon episode, (which is just as excellent to watch as both movies)!

If anyone, who is anyone who loves Bill and Ted, then you should definately get this DVD set; because it's most excellent! So be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!",1192838400,3,2419,4.452488687782806
2263587,5,B00094ARHS,"I saw Bill and Ted as a teen-ager.  Now my 14 year-old son and pre-teen kids love it.  Their friends have come over and seen these movies and really enjoyed them, too.  They are clean movies and are different enough from everything else, it keeps kids entertained.",1169683200,8,264,4.574468085106383
2263588,4,B00094ARHS,"If you loved the movies, you'll love the collection, but the bonuses are a bit lacking, as they have no extra fotage.",1162512000,2,117,4.363636363636363

8057140,5,B00094ARHS,"While I have loved these most excellent movies since first seeing them in the theaters, I never quite found a triumphant copy of them that was worth owning.  In fact, I found it quite bogus that these DVDs lacked special features in their individual packaging.  Thankfully, in a super example of good decision making, some royal production company dude decided to package the movies together with a special features DVD that made for a most outstanding purchase!  No longer will I settle for heinous DVDs with no special features!

Party on dudes!",1403740800,2,547,4.913043478260869
8057141,5,B00094ARHS,"These guys are the Sunday-school versions of Spacoli and Lebowski, but I'm not into weed anymore, so they rock.  The only thing they do is get two beers at a western bar without getting carded while chowin' down on some doughnuts and honey buns.  Still it would be cool to see how it would've turned out if The big Lebowski teamed up with them on their bogus  journey.  Could you even imagine Walter?  Whoa...  They've both got good philosophies, man.  Just take it easy and be excellent to each other.  They could even go bowling with Deacon and Napoleon.

No really, but this set is good for the fanatical dude.  Good special features with Steve Vai and the creators.  The movies are totally digital and in widescreen.  Not bad!  This is a favorite of mine.  In high school I too was into metal and babes.  I've watched it too many times, though when I had 'em on vhs, but I had to have this. I watched Bogus Journey several months ago.  Excellent!  If you're a fan, purchase this and kiss your fears and party on!",1402358400,3,1016,4.405405405405405

8057143,5,B00094ARHS,These movies are great to own on DVD.  It sure takes me back to my childhood when I watched them a ton.  I recommend these movies to anybody and young kids growing up.  I really can't wait for the third one to be made.  It should be really awesome!,1386115200,3,248,4.0
