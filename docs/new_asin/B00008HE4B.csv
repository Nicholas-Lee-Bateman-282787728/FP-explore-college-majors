1847422,5,B00008HE4B,"There's an apt little epigram that appears on screen as the movie opens.  ""There are three sides to every story,"" it says, ""my side, your side and the truth. And no one is lying. Memories shared serve each one differently.""  The speaker is Robert Evans, upon whose memoir, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"", this rousing and raucous documentary is based.  The epigram not only serves as a fancy little bit of wordplay to get the picture off on the right foot, but it also acts as the film's (and, more specifically, the subject's) credo.
Evans narrates the events of his life as they unfold on the screen.  His gravelly voice is a soothing guide, but it is the content of what is said that is addictive.  If this film had been made independently by directors Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen, without Evans' help, it would have been just another rise and fall and rise again Hollywood morality tale.  But Evans' presence lends it something more.  It gives the filmmakers, based solely on the forceful and gargantuan nature of his personality, license to tell this story only from Evans' myopic point of view.  Usually documentarians have a responsibility towards objectivism.  But with ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"", they're not really documenting Evans' life story, but his persona.  Which makes for a much livelier tale.
So we get Evans' version of why Mia Farrow, after enduring much heat from her then husband Frank Sinatra to quit, decided to stay in ""Rosemary's Baby"": because Evans, the slick operator, fed her dreams of Oscars and glory; and because Mia, a flighty and whiny little girl, had an actress' ego that needed massaging.  Is Mia given an opportunity to defend herself?  No!  Of course not!  Does it matter?  No!  Of course not!  Because Evans', and here is where the epigram comes in handy as an excuse, can tell a good story, especially when he comes out of it looking like a genius hero.  If he is to be believed, than ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Love Story"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Chinatown"" were all made by the singular vision of Robert Evans, and no one else (the only subject on which he is not completely egotistical is his acting; he rightfully acknowledges how lousy he was -- and offers video evidence to prove it!  Another gutsy move).  There's a lot of tall tales here, and a lot of toes stepped on.  And if Evans were any less charming, the whole picture would crumble under the weight of his huge ego.  But he is exceedingly charming, and it is on this charm that the picture coasts.
Farrow isn't the only one raked over the coals by Evans.  If you're going to live in his circle, you better be as outrageous and thick-skinned as he is.  There is much childish name-calling here:  Roman Polanski is ""The Little Pollack"", Ali MacGraw is ""Miss Snot Nose"", and Francis Ford Coppolla is repeatedly called, always with a sneer of contempt, ""The Prince"".  Evans refuses to pull his punches, to let anyone off easy, be they friend or foe.  He can do this because he takes none of it seriously.  As he says about Coppolla, in a contemporary interview clip from ""The Cotton Club"" days, ""We've fought many times before.""  Implying that despite their differences, he and Coppolla will eventually allow this melee to pass too.  Evans is a man who lives for the battle, especially when it's a battle fought for the sake of movies.
Besides the Tasmanian Devil-persona of its subject, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" has a lot of stylistic things going for it.  The look of the film is mostly achieved through Evans' personal photo collection, each picture manipulated so that the people in the foreground appear to float over the background.  It makes what could have been a very static collage come alive with action and movement.  This is most effectively used in the way the film portrays Charlie Bludhorn, the owner of Paramount Pictures who gave Evans his own studio to run.  Bludhorn's bald, bespectacled, toothy visage (along with Evans broad impression of his speaking voice) floats throughout the film; but we never see video of the man.  Doesn't matter, for his gruff, straightforward character shines through.  Old interviews and film clips from some of Evans' more famous movies are also thrown into the mix, giving the film a vibrant and manic feeling.
Except, that is, when the subject of Woodland comes up.  Woodland has been Evans' home for the past thirty years.  He lost it during his mid-1980s troubles, only to regain it thanks to Jack Nicholson.  It is his refuge away from the Hollywood hustle and bustle, and whenever he speaks of it, Evans gets a nostalgic and romantic lilt to his voice.  Burstein and Morgen allow their camera to float around Woodland, from its lush and colourful backyard, to its deep blue pool, to its comfortable corridors, making it a silent co-conspirator in Evans' story.  When he's riding high, Woodland seems like an oasis, a Xanadu, a utopia.  But when Evans is going through a rough spell, Woodland offers a sad reminder of his past glory, of what he has lost.  When he returns in triumph, Woodland is there waiting for him, arms open.  At times it felt like the house was a major character in the film, and I suspect that's not too far from Evans' own truth.
""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is rousing fun, regardless of its veracity.  Evans is a no-holds barred narrator, giving equal measure to his glorious highs and his agonizing lows.  You may find the man too slimy to ever want to meet in real life, but the 91 minutes you spend with his voice and his life story will be an hour and half worth giving up.",1028851200,15,5573,4.681397738951696

1847488,5,B00008HE4B,"This documentary brings you behind the studio walls and inside the Hollywood homes to let you know what it's really like. If you like show business this is a must have ! Evans knows how to tell a story !!!!

 Robert Evans has had a most interesting life as the Head of Paramount Pictures from the mid sixties to the mid seventies. He literally saved the studio from becoming a cemetery before becoming one of the most successful independent producers in all of show business. With his keen business sense and eye for a good story he brought to the studio such hit films as Rosemary's Baby, Goodbye Columbus, Love Story, The Godfather, True Grit, Marathon Man and Chinatown. I could go because there's a lot more but you'll hear all about these films and all the rest when you read his story in the Best Selling book or this Award winning Documentary. You'll also hear all about his interactions with Sinatra, Nicholson, Hoffman, Pacino, Brando and Coppola. After watching this you'll realize that Evans is a stand up guy, getting knocked down but getting back up and still swinging. He survived over sixty years in an industry that chews people up and swallows them.

This film will leave you wanting more ! It's fast paced style loaded with rare photos and previously unseen footage will enthrall you. Narrated by Evans himself you can hear the passion and excitement in his voice as he recounts his highs, lows and in betweens. With an excellent soundtrack and loaded with extras this is a must have !! If this version is no longer offered look for the re-issue, made to order dvd now available. Also, check out the best selling books The Kid Stays In The Picture and The Fat Lady Sang by Robert Evans and Conversations with Robert Evans by Lawrence Grobel for more fun Hollywood insight.",1435881600,2,1790,4.658227848101266

It's a gossipy, four letter word-laced diatribe accompanied by a very warm human appeal, especially when it comes to his son, Josh and his ex-wife Ali MacGraw.  Evans is particularly self-deprecating and shows great insight into his own character.  He considers himself a phoenix of sorts, rising and falling and rising again.

A unique,brilliant and volatile force of nature that Hollywood doesn't produce anymore.  His story is the stuff that dreams and nightmares are made of.  And if you stay with this picture you'll see both and then some. From a short mediocre acting career to the heights of movie moguldom at Paramount, its a warts and all look at Evans' Hollywood narrated by the man himself.

THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE manages to be both entertaining and educational.  Profound and profane and hardly suitable for ""This Is Your Life"" as so many legends from old Hollywood were remembered.  Evans gets his iconic life interlocked with the very iconic movies he created.  ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Love Story"", ""The Godfather"" to ""Chinatown and ""The Cotton Club"", to name just a few.  Paramount Pictures was the first Hollywood studio to be bought by a conglomerate. For Evans it was perfect timing, as he tells it in the picture but even better and more to the point, as documented in Gus Russo's book ""Supermob"" (also available on Amazon).  It wasn't just perfect timing, but having the right friend to recommend you to the powers that be.  He's briefly mentioned in the picture, but when it comes to power inside of Hollywood and out of it, Sidney Korshak is the man who takes care of business.  But thats another story.

The producers could have easily found a thousand people to talk about Bob, but then that would have made it just another routine fluffy biography.  As Evans is quoted at the very beginning ""There are three sides to every story. Your side. My side. And the truth"". With this story thankfully, its not always easy to tell the sides apart. And thats what makes a great picture!",1189036800,,1793,4.741935483870968
1847581,4,B00008HE4B,"The opening quote in The Kid Stays in the Picture states that there are three truths to every tale; Yours, Mine and The Truth, that none are wrong, and memory serves all differently. That's a paraphrase.
The quote is essential to this unique doc, about the sudden rise and precipitous fall of producer Robert Evans, and his current reassurgance. The quote is apt because, in narrating his own life story we get one of the three truths, and that truth is quite entertaining.
Director's Nanette Burstein & Brett Morgen use none of the standard doc interviews, no filmed footage, and little archived stuff, but mostly stills and pans of various environments that Evans lived in.
I value the doc for a character study and a history of Hollywood from someone who was in the trenches. It's one-sidedness is it's best and worst part. No Ali McGraw, no Coppola, no Nicholson, no Polanski, no Gulf+Western folks, etc. Evans is a hell of a showman, and a distinctly engrossing figure, from his look to his attitude to his wisdom.
But Dustin Hoffman ends up stealing the film, at the last minute, over the credits, with a hilarious imitation, filmed during Marathon Man, one of several gag reels filmed in Evan's honor during the making of the 1976 film.",1187395200,,1243,4.7592592592592595

1847595,4,B00008HE4B,"This could also have been entitled ""The Comeback Kid.""  Though the initial purpose of this documentary on the life and career of famed producer Robert Evans was perhaps to act as a nice coda to a colorful riches to rags story, in fact it has served to put Evans back in the public eye and revive his career as a producer.  Only five years ago Evans was largely a forgotten man, but today he has a number of projects underway.  No doubt this is in part due to having his various legal problems behind him, but clearly his memoir, which was then made into this documentary, played a major role.

THE KID STAYS IN THE PICUTRE is not your typical documentary.  For one thing, the only person who talks to the camera is the subject of the film.  This is hardly a mea culpa or apologia.  It is more of a warts and all self-affirmation of everything Evans has experienced in his career.  Much is left out.  There is surprisingly little detail on his love life excepting his romance with Ali McGraw, which was clearly the dominant relationship of his life.  But there is a frank acknowledgment of many errors made combined with an attitude that could be summed up, ""Well, I made a mess, but at least it was my mess.""

The heart of the film concerns Evans's triumphs as a producer.  Certainly few producers not named Weinstein have been involved in so many remarkable films.  ROSEMARY'S BABY, LOVE STORY, THE GODFATHER, CHINATOWN, MARATHON MAN, and THE COTTON CLUB are only a few of the many films he was involved on.  There are many fascinating stories about many of these, though for me the most fascinating was the behind the scenes footage taken during the filming of ROSEMARY'S BABY.  Another great moment is the short film that Evans made for the corporate powers that be who wanted to pull the plug on THE GODFATHER.

Almost as important as Evans as a character in the film is his beautiful home.  There is shot after shot of the grounds and the film finally ends with the only contemporary shot of Evans in the documentary, showing him sitting inside simply being Robert Evans.  If the film has a nadir, it comes when Evans was forced to sell his beloved home to a wealthy foreigner.  When he wanted to repurchase the home the man wouldn't agree to do so.  But Evans's friend Jack Nicholson took matters in his own hands and flew to visit the man, literally getting on his knees to beg him to sell the house back to Evans.  He relented and one of the most touching moments in the movie was the camera zooming in on the welcome home card that Nicholson wrote Evans.

All in all, film fans will find this to be an interesting and highly entertaining documentary.  Evans has had a colorful life, making his share of mistakes, suffering his share of both really great and truly awful luck, but sticking it out.  And partly because of this film, the kid did manage to stay in the picture, and his name will unquestionably appear on a few more films in the years to come.",1135728000,2,2964,4.476722532588455

I love the visual cut-motion style and a superb, evocative mix including music of the times then. Of course, how could anyone not be hypnotized by his speaking voice, which oozes that knowing which comes from having lived the life.

That one covered the first golden age of American Film.  The second golden age happened because a young Jewish businessman from New York ran into silent film legend Norma Shearer at a Beverley Hills hotel, and then was propelled into acting.  He played the Spanish matador in The Sun Also Rises, a film based on Ernest Hemingway's book.  This led to a minor film career that went poof in the fifties, so the young man bought rights to a few novels for peanuts: you know, The Godfather, Love Story, Marathon Man, and Serpico.  The next thing he knew, he was running Paramount Pictures and dating every beautiful woman in California.  He also discovered cocaine in the 80's and at the same time, a distant association with a murdered producer tarnished his image, so that he couldn't work in this town again.  Then he got his job back and made more pictures.  This all happened to Robert Evans.

1847612,4,B00008HE4B,"There was a time, still basking in the innocence of childhood, when I tended to see film stars as possessing a perfection that we mortals lacked. But that was also a time when we didn't know much about the stars other than what was on the screen. Movie fans had to rely on the puff pieces in Photoplay that had more in common with press agentry than journalism.

Now, in an age when celebrities are covered around the clock by a ""news"" media desperate to hang on to a dwindling audience, every rock is upturned and the snakes beneath them are crawling out, hissing uncontrollably as we watch in horror. When I think of Hollywood now, I remember the scene in ""The Shining"" when Jack Nicholson enters a bathroom to see a stunningly beautiful woman emerge from the tub. He embraces her only to be shocked that the woman is actually a withered old hag, and a dead one at that.

The movies are make-believe, but more and more it looks like the people who make them are make-believe, too. The starstruck audience has let withered old hags, dead in all but the literal sense, con us into believing they are great beauties. The biggest star and the devoted fan seem to be kindred spirits, both of them living vicariously through a carefully constructed image to give meaning to an otherwise empty life.

Robert Evans seems like a combination of both the star and the starstruck fan. Never a ""star"" in the traditional sense, Evans toiled behind-the-scenes, but like a ventriloquist who's jealous that the dummy gets all the laughs, he could never keep his permanently tanned mug out of the spotlight. On the surface, this fallen Hollywood kingpin's life looks like one to envy, but it's all so lacking substance that it might as well be the gateway to hell. Evans strikes me as the epitome of the man who had everything that money can buy, but desperately needed more to fill a void that only seemed to grow with success. I find his story, as told in this one-sided documentary, more depressing than entertaining, although I admit it's the latter, as well.

If everything you know about the period covered in this film comes from Evans, you'd wonder why the Hollywood sign hasn't been replaced with a statue in his image. Inexplicably chosen to head Paramount Pictures in the late Sixties, after bombing out as an actor in ""The Sun Also Rises"" and such drek as ""The Fiend Who Walked the West,"" he takes credit for saving the studio with box-office hits like ""Love Story"" and ""The Godfather."" No doubt Evans played a role in the studio's resurgance, but he takes more credit than he seems to deserve, claiming he convinced Francis Ford Coppola to add ""texture"" to the gangster movie that Evans insists the director saw as little more than a shoot-em-up B movie. But if Coppola thought so little of ""The Godfather"" and its potential, why would he work so hard to cast Marlon Brando against Paramount's objections at a time when Brando's reputation as the world's greatest actor meant nothing next to the string of bombs he starred in throughout the Sixites?

For that matter, can Evans rightfully claim he ""produced"" any of the films made under his reign as Paramount's top gun? The producer's credit for ""The Godfather"" went to Al Ruddy, who accepted the Oscar when the film was named Best Picture. In his book, Evans claims Ruddy was merely ""appointed,"" but it's hard to imagine a man of Evans's monumental ego not seizing credit especially if it rightfully belonged to him. As for the other hits that saved the magic mountain, ""Rosemary's Baby"" was produced by William Castle, ""The Odd Couple"" was produced by Howard Koch, ""Love Story"" was produced by Howard Minsky, and on and on and on with Evans never earning an on-screen credit for anything until ""Chinatown.""
But Evans wasn't content to be the head of a studio with the power to greenlight a project. He wanted to be a star! Hence his weird biography (in which every conversation sounds like it came from a 30's gangster movie) and this so-called documentary.

This ""documentary,"" like the book it's based on, is fascinating  for all the wrong reasons. It's meant to be some kind of tribute to Evans and his success, but it simply exposes him as the vainest of empty shells. The Kid stays in the picture all right, but only by vandalizing the true portrait with ego, half-truths, and lies.",1076025600,6,4337,4.683727034120735
1847613,4,B00008HE4B,"The casual viewer of the life of Bob Evans, a man who spent most of his working life as a successful Paramount Pictures executive and creative producer would say that he was the kind of man who could accidentally fall into a cesspool and emerge with two fistfuls of cash.
That casual observer would be correct. Evans was born connected, good looking and charismatic. What the casual observer might not know, however, is that Evans is also visionary, intelligent, hard working and committed. His sharp dress and looks belie his New York City vulgar idiom, something that shaped his overall persona.
This beautifully realized memoir is a must- see for any Hollywood aficionado. Evans narrates it in a natural, unaffected way, one can imagine, the way he would tell you across an intimate dinner table, making you wince and chuckle along the way. His few miscalculations in life, notably marrying a working female actor (something we are warned not to do) and getting into the drug scene, albeit briefly, when it was in vogue and thus falling prey to the voracious media monster, can easily be forgiven. The man, after all, gave us much more than we could possibly have given back to him, many years of top-flight entertainment.

1847614,4,B00008HE4B,"The Kid Stays in the Picture is a glitzy peek into Hollywood in the 70's as seen through the eyes of one of its prime movers: Robert Evans.  You may not have heard the name Robert Evans, but you've definitely seen movies he's produced: Rosemary's Baby, The Godfather and Chinatown are just the tip of the iceberg as far as his career goes.
The documentary has a unique, but somewhat flawed, style.  The directors put up many of Mr. Evans' personal photographs (enhanced with 3D effects), TV and movie footage and have Evans himself narrate the entire movie (his narration is taken from book-on-tape version of his biography).  The period of his life covered from his discovery in a Beverly Hills swimming pool to his meteoric rise to fame to becoming persona non grata in Hollywood and back to acceptance in Tinseltown.  Evans' cool self-assesment provides a facinating look into one of the most volatile and creative decades in Hollywood history.  The only problem is that because Evans is the only person narrarating, the perspective, although very interesting, is somewhat limited.  Evans himself does not bore for a second in the film though.  His warbly barritone is almost hypnotic.
I caught this movie by accident on HBO one afternoon, and I was thoroughly pleased with what I saw.  It was more compelling than most documentaries that are out on the market.

Certainly not one life's loftiest goals, but in pure Hollywood style it has been raised to the level of Godliness. This movie should appeal to perenially hip and chronically insecure types.",1068336000,10,419,4.833333333333333
1847616,5,B00008HE4B,"We saw the San Francisco premiere of ""The Kid Stays in the Picture.""  Robert Evans showed up to introduce the movie and answer questions afterwards.  It was a great juxtaposition:  the young lion Evans on screen vs. the Evans in the flesh who had a serious stroke a couple of years back.  Its obvious that he's fought a tough road to recovery.
It was also obvious that the release of 'Kid' was an important milestone for him.  As the film shows, Evans has been a battler all his life, so why stop now?  It's this atttitude that has brought him a whole new generation of fans.
The movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.  When Evans' book was released in the early 90s, the print edition had no real impact.  The audio edition, however, was a sensation.  Narrated by Evans himself in his unmistakable gravelly baritone, the tapes became a cult sensation, passed around Hollywood like a forbidden, guilty pleasure.
The film simply takes those original recordings and uses them as the soundtrack.  The majority of the images are compiled, amazingly enough, from photos of Evans' career, enhanced through some eye-popping innovation:  somehow, the filmmakers have turned the photos into 3-D like montages which appear to burst through the screen.  Combined with Evans' voice, it's a truly unique viewing experience.
What makes the narration so compelling is Evans ability to do both sides of the various conversations he recounts, whether it's ex-wife and muse Ali McGraw, Jack Nicholson, Francis Ford Coppola or, most notably, then-Gulf & Western CEO and conglomerater Charlie Bludhorn.  The Bludhorn imitation stands out.  Think Henry Kissinger as a modern-day robber baron and you get the idea.
Of course, you're getting Evans' view here, and Evans' view alone, unencumbered by rebuttal.  In Evans' retelling, Coppola was headed into the abyss with 'The Godfather' until Bobby set him straight and gave him the appropriate vision.  Somehow, I think Coppola and Mario Puzo might have had a bigger hand in that than what Evans' imagination leads him to believe.  But you don't see this movie seeking the truth, just Robert Evans' version of it.  For that alone, 'Kid' is a must-see.",1066867200,,2186,4.975206611570248
1847617,5,B00008HE4B,"Based on his book, this film traces the rise and fall of a Hollywood player Robert Evans, who was behind the critically acclaimed films like ""Godfather"" ""Chinatown"" and others.  If you have read the book already, the surprise you get from this unique and not-so-objective documenatary may not be so big.  Still, it is irresistible to know some bits of inside stories of Hollywood, and some footages are really fascinating, as I tell you later.
As you know, Robert Evans (most recently co-produced Kate Hudson hit ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"") is a Hollywood mogul who started his career as, most fittingly, an actor who played Irving Thalberg in ""Man of a Thousand Faces.""  But what he really wished for was something better than the unstable status of handsome idol star; he wanted something more powerful, which means the role of producer.
Recollecting the days of chasing his career in Tinsel Town, Robert Evans talks about many episodes; about Mia Farrow's behaviors toward her (then) husband Frank Sinatra during the shooting of ""Rosemary's Baby""; his meeting with Ali MacGraw and parting with her; and his devastivating experience about ""The Cotton Club.""  If you like this kind of gossip or inside stories, you might have already heard them.  (For example, William Castle was first supposed to direct ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but Evans wanted Polanski.)  Still, I admit I was drawn into the incredible world as he remembers.
The highlight of the film is, to me, the follwing two; one is a short film made especially for pursuading the execs of the Gulf and Western not to dump Paramount Picture.  Here you can see Evans himself ""pitch"" in front of a camera (directed by Mike Nichols!), and tells the merit of keeping the present course, promising a hit movie next Christmas, which, eventually, was to be ""Love Story.""  The other comes during the end credit of the film, in which you can see young Dustin Hoffman (around the time of ""Marathon Man"") impersonate Evans (the footage shot at Evans' home Woodland), which is very, very funny.
You may say the narration, all provided by Evans himself, has some tone of self-absorption.  And you are probably right.  But he has lived a life that deserves that glorification (for good or worse), so let's not talk about it.
The director team Brett Morgan and Nanette Burnstein skillfully uses the vintage clips of films, photos, and TV footages.  The photos are allowed to move, as if in animation, so the film sometimes looks like photo montage you have seen in surrealism art movement.  Though there are no interviews specially prepared for this occasion, the film is very intersting and rivetting to see, and it's not bad to know some of Jack Nicholson's surprising and tender side (and that crazy photo).",1066608000,,2752,4.869379014989294
1847618,3,B00008HE4B,"""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is a pull-no-punches chronicle of Hollywood producer Robert Evans' rise and fall in the movie business; narrated by Evans himself with one of the better voices you've ever heard, it either interests you or it doesn't, that interest directly proportional to one's fondness and intellectual investment in the movie business itself.
Evans was on his way to becoming an Evan Piccone pants mogul in the 1960s when Norma Shearer spotted him by a Beverly Hills pool and insisted he be cast as her husband, Hollywood mogul Irving Thalberg, in the Lon Chaney biopic, ""The Man with 1,000 Faces."" He got the role, and later kept a plum role as the bullfighter in ""The Sun Also Rises,"" despite the protests of Ernest Hemingway and Ava Gardner, when studio chief Daryl Zanuck visited the set, watched Evans perform a scene and said, ""The kid stays the in picture."" From that moment forward, Evans didn't want to be the kid. He wanted to be Zanuck.
And Zanuck he would become for Paramount Studios, which, at the time he took it over, was well behind giants 20th Century and MGM, not to mention six others. But Evans bought a book, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and found a director, Roman Polanski, that put the studio closer to the Hollywood epicenter. Paramount became the epicenter a few years later when a 30-year-old actress, Ali MacGraw, presented Evans with a project, ""Love Story,"" and, later, her hand in marriage. It touched off a classic movie run that included ""The Godfather"" and ""Chinatown""
The ""rise"" portion of the film is its best, as Evans recalls the beautiful, mercurial MacGraw in their first meetings - ""for a hippee,"" Evans says, ""she sure was comfortable in my pool"" - through her affair with Steve McQueen, for whom she walked from roles in ""Chinatown"" and ""The Great Gatsby."" Soon after, Evans opted out of Paramount for his own producing deal and fared well through the 1970s before, in, 1979, becoming a coke addict, getting arrested for trying to buying pharmaceutical grade in 1980, then producing a boondoggle in ""The Cotton Club"" 1984 - which also deep-sixed director Francis Ford Coppola's career as an important movie director. By late 80s, Evans was broke, out of the house he'd owned for 20 years, admitting himself a mental hospital and beginning a comeback that led to another producing deal with Paramount, albeit with movies a cut below Academy Award fare.
Directors Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen don't exactly use a camera, but compile archive footage, photo stills and cutouts to create a running stream of images, a motion picture collage of sorts, under (and sometimes over) Evans' narration. Only occasionally do the directors interject images that tell the story beyond Evans' words - in one case, as Evans describes his mental hospital stay, scenes from Paramount rush forth in an interesting commentary about the weight of prominent history on a fallen giant.
""Kid"" suffers from this approach, too - it would have been nice to see a Coppola interview, or a Polanski interview, or, if it could have been swung, a few minutes with the reclusive MacGraw. Evans doesn't hide from his foibles, but it is difficult, until Dustin Hoffman channels him in a spoof during the credits, to understand just what Evans could be like; if the imitation is to be believed - and it is - the laconic narrator is not exactly what he seems. Other times, Evans just lies - he says ""Chinatown"" won every award there was to win, when in fact, as good as it was, the movie played second fiddle to ""The Godfather, Part II.""  The advantage of Evans' narration is clear; the lack of balance negates some of it.
Yet the documentary's speed and directness puts it a cut above the typical A&E Biography material. Evans is droll, wise and regretful; he speaks like a man who tasted the top, and, not unlike the John Huston character in ""Chinatown,"" would very much trade his respectability for a taste again.",1065052800,7,3935,4.821005917159764
1847619,4,B00008HE4B,"""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is a documentary based on Robert Evans' autobiography of the same name. Narrated by Evans himself and illustrated with interviews, movie clips, publicity photos and paparazzi footage, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" traces the career of this iconic Hollywood producer from his serendipitous introduction to the film industry in the 1950's to his return to Paramount pictures in the 1990's after a long estrangement. Robert Evans' already had a successful career and great prospects with Evan Picone's fashion house when he was discovered poolside by Norma Shearer and immediately asked to play the part of her late husband in the film ""Man of a Thousand Faces "". That kind of incredible, but double-edged, luck would come to characterize Evans' film career and his life. He became a magnet for controversy when Ernest Hemingway demanded that Evans be removed from his second film role, that of Pedro Romero in the film adaptation of Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"". Producer Darryl Zanuck disagreed, however, and declared, ""The kid stays in the picture!"" to all who would oppose him. Thus, Zanuck gave Robert Evans the title for his future autobiography and a new goal: to become a producer. Robert Evans tells us the story of his surprising meteoric rise to the head of Paramount pictures in 1967, then the 9th most successful studio in Hollywood, and how he transformed Paramount into Hollywood's premier studio. Among the most entertaining stories from that ""Second Golden Age"" of Hollywood, the 1970's,  are Evans' search for a director for Mario Puzo's book ""The Godfather"" and his insistence that Francis Ford Coppola make the film longer, and his battle of wills with Frank Sinatra to get Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" finished. Evans speaks honestly of his marriage to actress Ali MacGraw and the legal troubles which ended his tenure at Paramount and left him in financial ruin in the 1980's. Movie buffs and fans of Hollywood lore will enjoy ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"". Be sure to stick around for Dustin Hoffman's hilarious imitation of Robert Evans which runs during the end credits and perfectly tops off Evans' life story.",1062028800,2,2176,5.044444444444444

Evans, in charge of film production at Paramount Studios, is called by the company chiefs to fly to New York for a meeting.  Rumor has it that not only will Evans and others lose their jobs but Paramount Studios may shut down altogether. Prior to the meeting, Evans has an idea.  He hires director Mike Nichols(""The Graduate"")to film a five minute ""advertisment"".  The ad simply consists of Evans talking to the camera and expounding, as only Evans can, why the future of Paramount should not only continue but why it will it return as a powerhouse in Hollywood. Deceptively straighforward and simple, Evans sways the executives to keep Paramount's gates open and the rest, as they say, is show business history.
""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" is a documentary based on Evans' book of the same title.  The film is narrated by Evans in a voice that can only be described as undescribable.  Evans tells his story, for the most part, chronologically beginning in New York where Evans and his brother, as young adults, were involved in the production of women's clothing.  Having childhood ties to the movie business, Evans was discovered(or some would say rediscovered)while swimming in a pool in Beverly Hills.  From there, he got a role opposite James Cagney in ""The Man With 1,000 Faces."" He appeared in two more feature films before it became clear that he didn't have a promising acting career ahead of him.  Having always a desire to be behind the camera, Evans moved ahead, made some very smart moves, and ended up being picked by Paramount head Charles Bludhorn to be the top film producer for the studio.
It becomes clear that Evans' rise to the top of the industry is not only due to his take charge and gutsy personality but also his uncanny future vision.  At the same time Evans was beginning his career at Paramount in the the mid to late 60's, the youth movement across the country was in full bloom.  There was clearly a ""new guard"" vs ""old guard"" mentality in Hollywood that
was emerging.  Unlike a lot of producers at the time, Evans was smart enough to find and attract the young writers, directors and actors who began to make up the ""New Hollywood"" in the late 60's and early 70's. With movies like ""The Godfather"", ""Love Story""(he ended up marrying star Ali McGraw), ""The Odd Couple"", and ""Chinatown"", Evans moved Paramount from last to first in annual ticket sales.
If Evans' story had stopped in 1975, he would have already been a legend in Hollywood.  Unfortunately, in Hollywood, what goes up always comes down, and Evans was no exception. Admitting that prior to the 70's, he rarely drank, Evans tells his story of how he became one of many cocaine victims during the decade and was, ultimately, shunned by Hollwood for years.  To make matters worse, by the time the mid- 80's rolled around, Evans' name was being conected to a drug related murder in which he was never a suspect.
All these details are told with fascinating intensity by Evan as he narrates his life story over a surreal montage of still vintage photos and videos.  One of things I love about this movie is how honest Evans is with himself.  Yes, he may seem cocky or pompous, however, there is a very clear self-depreciating attitude thought out the film as well.  He is also not afraid to have some of his contempt(justified or not)spill forward. His famous conflicts with director Francis Ford Coppola are now Hollywood folklore and are documented here(when receiving his Academy Award at the Oscars for ""The Godfather"", Coppola ""forgot"" to thank the producer).
After viewing the ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"", I began to wonder why I loved it so much.  I grew up in the 80's and 90's and I didn't really know much about Evans until I read Peter Biskind's masterpiece, ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"".  That book, along with this film, records an incredible age in Hollywood that exisited in the late 60's and 70's.  An age  where the films that were produced were films bursting energy and creativity which we have not seen since that time. Producers, directors, actors and other involved wanted to make money but they also wanted to make smart, cutting edge films that didn't always conform.  Today, with marketing at the center of the creative element in today's films, conforming is now the desired result. ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" recalls a brief period of time in Hollywood when that wasn't so.
Note: Watch the credits of this movie. Dustin Hoffman does an amusing Robert Evans bit.",1061596800,,4941,4.734265734265734
1847621,4,B00008HE4B,"""The Kid Stays in the Picture,"" a documentary about famed movie producer and studio head Robert Evans, begins like ""The Great Gatsby,"" a film Evans produced in 1974.  To the wistful strains of ""What'll I Do?"" playing in the background, the camera glides lovingly over the furnishings, pictures and memorabilia that adorn Evans' Bel Air mansion and estate.  The comparison is an apt one, for, like Gatsby, Evans was a wunderkind, a handsome young go-getter who knew early on the kind of life he wanted to lead and who willed himself to attain it.  With a combination of good looks, charm, ambition and just a bit of plain old-fashioned good luck, he managed to go from being a mediocre movie actor to becoming the head of Paramount Studios in the course of a mere decade.  And what a decade it was!  Evans had a major hand in not only lifting Paramount from ninth to first place among Hollywood's major studios, but in bringing such films as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""True Grit,"" ""Love Story,"" ""Chinatown"" and, of course, ""The Godfather"" to movie screens everywhere.
""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is a dream-come-true for hardcore cinephiles, providing a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into one of the true Golden Ages of Hollywood filmmaking.  Evans' story is, in fact, the story of that time, for truly he hobnobbed with virtually every one of the key players responsible for that era.  Evans' tale follows a fairly conventional arc for men of his type: the ambitious kid with dreams of larger-than-life glory achieves meteoric success in the entertainment business only to have his ambitions dashed on the shores of rampant egotism, overconfidence and drug addiction.  In fact, Evans' life would make perfect fodder for a film of its own, as this documentary and the positive response to it demonstrates.  Evans himself narrates the film, and although he tends to be a bit easier on himself than an outsider might have been, he is still willing to chastise himself when he feels it's called for and to render some rather startlingly unflattering assessments of certain major players on the Hollywood scene.  He is, also, however, utterly devoted to those he feels have stuck by him through good times and bad, and he is not averse to lavishing praise on others when it is due.  One objection to Evans' narration is that he doesn't always speak with the utmost clarity, sometimes making what he says come out garbled and incomprehensible.
As a piece of filmmaking, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" offers a kaleidoscopic array of stills, film clips and reenactments that reflect the temper and mood of the time.  Directors Brett Morgan and Nanette Burstein obviously pored through a wealth of material on the subject, culling from it a comprehensive, streamlined and fast-moving narrative that grips the audience with its humor, its sadness and its tribute to the indomitableness of the human spirit.  For if Evans' story is about anything, it is about how important it is for each individual to achieve his dreams and how equally vital it is for that same person, once he has fallen down, to pick himself up off the floor so that he can continue pursuing that dream.
""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is a wonderful time capsule for those who love movies.  No true film fan should miss it.",1061251200,,3288,4.858676207513417

1847633,5,B00008HE4B,"I saw this autobiographical movie/documentary on cable TV early AM, May 28th, 2003. The story of Mr. Evans and his rise to become one of the top movie producers of the late 20th century is mingled with genuine introspective commentary by the narrator, Robert Evans himself, combined with a sardonic wit, a great sense of humor and irony, and the open admission of the calculated expertise necessary to wangle one's way through the corporate jungle, and above all, the film industry's ultimately most competitive one at that. His own admission of the egotism necessary to accomplish such extraordinary feats, combined with good luck, being in the right place at the right time, sheer hard work, the willingness to take chances and gamble all, based upon one's own faith and belief in the ability to achieve greatness despite the challenge of adversity posed by more conservative investors, studio executives, board members, and critics surrounding him, display the successful achievement of the ultimate challenge; through a combination of greatness, innovation, wit, and sheer balls, and is mingled with his own readiness to admit character flaws, and ultimately his sheer honesty in expressing the results of introspection after total disaster precluded by ultimate success. These can serve as an inspiration to anyone (myself included) seeking to accomplish greatness in whatever field of endeavor they choose, and record for others the testament of a living legend in the field of cinematic production. His portrayal of the ultimate conquest of the greatest human challenge, that of the loss of belief in oneself, mingled with the loss of self itself, triggered by drugs and their progressively insidious control over one's own perception and values, by overcoming these life-threatening situations and gaining back the self-respect and most cherished possessions having been previously lost, is tempered by his own willingness for brutal self-honesty in admitting and characterizing the road from ultimate success to a living hell, and the successful, slow struggle back to comparative normalcy. These all serve as an example of the strength of the human will to accomplish any task set before oneself, despite any adversity, combined with the essential ingredient of raw talent, perceptual insight and sheer drive. This film is a legacy to all who seek to achieve their own breed of greatness. An absolutely MUST SEE MOVIE!",1054080000,,2428,5.325520833333333
1847634,5,B00008HE4B,"""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is the best biographical documentary I have ever seen. Robert Evans narrates his experiences in the film industry with humor and humility.

1847635,5,B00008HE4B,"This is quite possibly the best documentary that I've ever seen. From his beginnings of being ""discovered"" at a Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool to his marriage to Ali McGraw to his stint as the head of Paramount Pictures, all of his stories were great. Robert Evans shoots from the hip, tells it like it is (or was) and pulls no punches. The producers of the film did a wonderful job in casting Mr. Evans as the narrator for his own life story. His insight was told in a way that only the person that lived this life could have told it.
If you like movies and what takes place behind the camera then this movie is a must see. Better than any E! True Hollywood Story that you've ever seen.",1039564800,3,690,4.2748091603053435
1847636,5,B00008HE4B,"This movie opens up with the most breathtaking view of Evan's home. I really loved his home. Evans seems like an honest man who tells it like it is without pretense or defenses. I liked this about him. He talks about his life openly starting out with beginning his clothes line in the East, Evans and Piccone, and being picked out by Shearer to star in a movie opposite her. The movie tells of his job at paramount and the great movies he had a hand in bringing to the big screen. The film was orignal and stands out from most documentaries that seem to be illustrating some dramatic point. This movie was dish but it also has a note of seriousness. Evan's life was not all a fairy tale, there seems to have been some real sadness and lonliness going on that comes out more fully near the end of the picture. I never knew that he and Ally Mcgraw had been married. Well see this movie if you want a special experience at the theaters, something out of the ordinary. The style of the film is exceptional!

1847637,5,B00008HE4B,"Okay, find a film where the narrator is almost the only voice you hear, playing all the parts -- voices of the 20th century's most famous moguls, actresses, actors, directors -- along with mostly stills and very little action photography, and yet causes one to feel completely enthralled? Where the narrator allows himself to be shown in all of his disgrace as well as his glory, not hiding the irony in his successes and failures -- showing alongside his unashamed pride, his sense of humor about himself and his weaknesses -- and still comes across as a whole, real, man? One to be admired (because one surely will not envy him)? Only the indominable Robert Evans could pull this off. See this movie for the dirt, for the history, for the kind of story you can't make up ... and you'll think about him and everyone in it, long after.

1847638,5,B00008HE4B,"Forget ""The Player"". ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" is the most audacious, unapologetic and revealing look at Hollywood ever put on film. Legendary producer Robert Evans (""The Godfather"", ""Chinatown"") provides the voiceover for this overview of his career with a bemused, world-weary delivery recalling William Holden in ""Sunset Boulevard"" (this guy's life story could easily eat up an entire season of the E! network's ""True Story"" episodes). Evans has a knack for recounting immensely compelling, almost mythic backstage tales that manage to be hilarious and harrowing all at once. His candor and self-deprecating charm is so disarming that you'll find yourself leaning into the screen at times as if you were sitting in a quiet bar catching up with an old friend (the man is definitely a ""closer""). Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein do a masterful job blending film clips, stills and subtly moody shots of Evans' gothic Hollywood mansion. Anyone who claims to be a ""film buff"" would be doing themselves a disservice if they miss this one. Be sure to watch the credits for a funny and priceless ""home movie"" clip featuring Dustin Hoffman doing an uncanny, riotously profane Evans impression (Hoffman supposedly based his character in ""Wag The Dog"" on long-time pal Evans).",1031097600,6,1284,5.177884615384615
1847639,5,B00008HE4B,"Bobbie Evans is one of the great Master's of Producing.  It is because men like him, that I dreamed of telling stories as my career.  The Kid Stays In The Picture is better then any film class I ever took.  His vision, passion, love for people and drive is shown in this wonderful picture.  Bobs soothing, whiskey-cigar voice takes you away from the real world and takes you along on a fantastic journey.  If this doesn't receive an honor at the 75th Academy Awards...then Hollywood will continue to prove, that it is honoring some lame duck pictures.  I personally have asked that Bob receive special honors this year...he has waited long enough, and should be honored for his marvelous story telling.

1847640,5,B00008HE4B,"Even though the reviews of this film were almost universally raves, I wouldn't have gone to see it. But a friend wanted to go, so I went along. And I'm truly glad I did. This is not like any documentary (particularly of a Hollywood notable) I've ever seen. For those of us who watch A & E Biography to glean tidbits of unknown information about ""the famous,"" The Kid Stays in the Picture is a world apart, a completely refreshing take on biographical film-making.
What sets this film apart is its honesty. Evans's narration is self-deprecating, self-mocking, truthful and utterly unpretentious. The combination of TV and film clips, stills with subtle bits of animation (cigarette smoking rising from the surface of a photo) and the voiceover explanations of how some of Evans's films came to be is nothing less than compelling. It's also very, very funny. One notable description is of Frank Sinatra's ultimatum to Mia Farrow during the filming of the groundbreaking Rosemary's Baby. Either Mia finished the picture on day X or she could forget about coming home. How Evans schmoozed Mia into completing the picture is a great combination of smart hard-sell and appeal to the actress's ego. There are similar tales about how Coppola came to be the director of The Godfather.
Without copping any attitude, with painting any portion of his career in pastels, Evans comes across as a smart fellow with a great feeling for the books that make good movies. And the final scene, with Dustin Hoffman doing a long impersonation of Evans while the end credits run is absolutely hilarious.
If you have any interest in film-making, or want to know about a legendary Hollywood producer, or simply wish to see one swell documentary, see this movie. It's one of a kind.
Highly recommended.",1029801600,23,1776,4.8841059602649
1847641,4,B00008HE4B,"Darn! I should read the paper more closely. It turns out that the filmmakers actually spoke at the theater where I saw this movie(Upstate Films in Rhinebeck NY, if I can give them the plug) the DAY BEFORE! My timing is bad like that. Or maybe not, after all. I enjoyed this well-made documentary, based on Evans' autobio of the same name, but now that I think of it, I probably would have had a hard time coming up with a half-way decent question or comment for the filmmakers.
This is an engaging look at the Hollywood of the past 40 years or so, but neither it nor Evans himself is particularly reflective or insightful. If you're a film-buff of a particular stripe (one at least somewhat caught up in Hollywood lore) this may be the film for you. If, like many people, you enjoy at least some Hollywood product but are not particularly fascinated by its machinations, then it may be one you can pass up. Me, well, I'm kinda in between. I found it engrossing and somewhat instructive about what it takes to survive in a cut-throat industry. That much insight is there certainly.
But it's no surprise that Hollywood is heartless and (these days especially) art-less.  KID does not pretend to be an expose in any event.  As a film biography of someone you may or may not have heard of, or may or may not care about, it is pretty effective however.

7984243,3,B00008HE4B,"I have three big issues with this biopic. First, the epigraph suggests that there are different versions of the truth and that Evans will present his own version. Yet the film (narrated by Evans) simply presents facts that nobody seems to dispute. The epigraph, therefore, seems entirely irrelevant to the film (and possibly misleading).

Second, the film has no real overarching message or theme. Normally, a biopic will try to give an overall sense of a subject's life or present some kind of unifying idea. This film, though, presents a bunch of disparate events (his brief acting career, his work as a movie producer, his drug-trafficking arrest, etc.) coming one after another with no real sense of cohesion.

Third, whoever decided to let Evans narrate should never work in movies again. He mumbled so often that I couldn't make out many of his words (even after repeated listenings), and his delivery was monotonous. I can only imagine how much I might have enjoyed this had they gotten a John Lithgow or a Bryan Cranston to narrate! What a lost opportunity. Having the subject narrate his own story does provide some authenticity, but Evans did such a bad job that I really don't think it was worth it.

Despite all of this movie's shortcomings, the vicissitudes of Evans' life were fascinating enough to maintain my interest, and there were plenty of good visuals (video and still photographs) to complement the story, so I'm (somewhat reluctantly) giving this movie three stars.",1499644800,,1488,4.967871485943775
