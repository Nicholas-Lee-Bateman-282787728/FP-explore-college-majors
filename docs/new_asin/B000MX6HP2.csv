and closing of the movie. What a ripoff. Plus, two discs were not required.",1257552000,,192,4.361111111111111
8323657,4,B000MX6HP2,"This is an excellent WWII movie.  However, the quality of this Chinese recording is low, as if it were copied from a VHS (probably was).  Also the English subtitles are poor, obviously not copied from the script but transcribed by listening to (and misunderstanding) the actors.  I will keep my VHS copy and wait for a better DVD version.",1216771200,,338,4.694915254237288
