8265204,5,B00177Y9TI,"This Joe D' Amato classic begins with Melissa Chementi nude on an exotic Caribbean island beach with a peaceful musical score from Stelvio Cipriani. This is followed by her seducing a guy and then biting his manhood off in a cheap effect that simply shows her mouth full with what looks like a chunk of red meat. Later, a couple encounters a cannibal cult indoors in a dilapidated village. This shows some real dead pigs being gutted that's followed by a man being stabbed and his heart being torn out and bitten in a cult ritual. This is the extent of the films gore scenes, so it isn't recommended if you're just looking for gore. Despite the title and cool cover art, this movie has only those gore scenes and isn't very intense. It's loaded with sex and full frontal nudity and has beautiful locations, along with very peaceful Caribbean island atmosphere. The acting is decent, and I thought D' Amato's directing is really good. The picture basically involves a couple being seduced by Chementi, and they encounter that cannibal cult in that one sequence. The title is somewhat misleading as the cannibalism is limited to only the scene in the beginning with Chementi, and that quick scene when the guy takes some bites from that guy's heart during the ritual. Most of the film concentrates on providing a relaxing type tone by showcasing its exotic Caribbean locations, along with sex, nudity, and excellent soundtracks by Stelvio Cipriani. ""Papaya Song,"" ""Papaya Run,"" ""Jazzy Papaya,"" ""Caribbean Papaya"" and the other soundtracks are all excellent scores by Cipriani; these play a major role in the success of the film. If you don't like the soundtracks, you might not like the film; you can listen to them on YOUTUBE. The best scene in the film is a full nudity strip dance to ""Papaya Run"" that occurs during that sequence with that cannibal cult; I thought this is a great funky sequence. If you're a fan of D'Amato and 70s grindhouse you might really like the film, but be aware that the lack of action and violence may cause many to be bored.

The quality isn't as pristine as some of Severin's other films. It has grain and is a little dark, but I still thought it looked very good overall. It would've been more enjoyable if the quality was a little better, but the film is rare. Some people who buy a lot of Severin DVDs may be somewhat disappointed with the quality. I bought this DVD years ago, and I still watch it because I'm fan of D'Amato.",1380240000,2,2459,4.639908256880734

Directed by Joe D'Amato (Anthropophagus and Emanuelle in America).

Ever since I herd that this Joe D'Amato classic was coming out into DVD, I was so excited and couldn't wait!! Released a last week on DVD by Severin (Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade). Now Fully Uncut and Uncensored

Me, like most people owned the VSOM version or the X-Rated Cult DVD - That I thought were uncut?

But, when I received my copy of the Joe D'Amato classic.... I was not very happy!!! The DVD cover design/packaging was great - But, c'mon.... the DVD had Not one single special feature besides a Damn trailer that I could go online if I wanted to watch it!!

Could Severin not get Stelvio Cipriani to do an interview? They at least have put the Damn soundtrack from the film as a Bonus Disc, especially since the movie cost almost $30.

Also, the picture quality of the movie doesn't even look like is remastered! I checked out [...] and for some odd reason Jess Franco's Devil Hunter and Bloody Moon, that cost only $17.99 (WTF!!) are remastered and are in High Definition and also include MORE then a Damn trailer as a special feature...they both include rare Jess Franco interviews!! I don't understand???

Well, I've wasted enough of my time talking about this Amazing Joe D'Amato classic. It is a Must have for any Italian,Horror,Joe D'Amato fan! I'd wait til the price goes down.

8265206,4,B00177Y9TI,"D'Amato's best Caribbean film, with beautiful actresses, quite a witty script and a classic D'Amato mix of animal cruelty (a cock fight!), lesbianism, heart sacrifice and some political humour. Great framing and cinematography too. There's always another D'Amato film to discover, and this one is up there with the best.",1214870400,9,320,5.42
8265207,2,B00177Y9TI,"I wanted to give this a 2 1/2 star rating but decided to round it down rather than up. First, don't be fooled by the title. There ain't no Cannibals. It is a VooDoo sect in the Dominican Republic. Yep, the same place from which came Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. This is typical Joe and there is  plenty of nudity. If rated it would probably get an ""R"". The editing was sloppy to say the least and it was grainy at times. This might be an OK rental for a one time viewing, but not to own. Unlike some of his other works, the sex is pretty bland and didn't appear to be his main focus, which I find somewhat unusual, all things considered. Charlie S.",1214438400,16,653,4.1015625
