8314123,4,B001K2KMCI,"Very nicely done. Detailed, insightful and presented in a fairly balanced way.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the lack of Confederate perspective. I would say it was about 75% Union and 25% Confederate 'take' on the event, which in this PC/historical revisionist country is actually pretty good.",1490572800,,307,5.019607843137255
8314124,3,B001K2KMCI,"After viewing this video twice, I found that the similarly titled ""The Hunt For John Wilkes Booth"" (from The History Channel) is vastly superior to this National Geographic production.  This video is too short and too sketchy.  The video runs 50 minutes (as compared to the aforementioned History Channel video which is 94 minutes).  One of the most annoying things about the Nat'l Geo video is the over-use of ""still pictures in motion"" which sometimes spins and zips leaving the viewer a little dizzy.  The producers also chose to colorize historic iconic black and white photos of many of the principle characters.  The actor portraying Booth did not even vaguely look like Booth.  Many of the very same experts interviewed for the History Channel production are featured on this video but with far less to say.  All in all, if the subject matter is of interest to you, go for The History Channel video.  You'll get more bang for your buck.",1402617600,3,943,4.813664596273292
8314125,5,B001K2KMCI,The Hunt For Lincoln's Assassin goes into great detail on the massive search for Booth as he tried to flee from Virginia into Maryland with a broken leg and was finally captured and held in a barn and arrested .,1381449600,,211,4.3
8314126,5,B001K2KMCI,Great movie! Very detailed account of the search and capture of John Wilkes Booth and what he had to go through the 12 days he was on the run,1361059200,,141,3.896551724137931
8314127,5,B001K2KMCI,"My only criticism of this video is, as it is with most Lincoln Assassination videos, is that it hardly touches on any conspiracy theories. The facts it presents are very well done, and it flows very well, but I am a conspiracy fanatic, and if you want to read our ""bible"", get the book RETURN OF ASSASSIN JOHN WILKES BOOTH'.  If you have seen the SUNN film THE LINCOLN CONSPIRACY, this book is the film in book form. It presents the cospiracy end extremely well and I guarantee you will like it if not begin to believe it.  Again, this video is EXCELLENT!!! And if you get the chance, get up to the Clinton, Maryland area in the spring or fall and get on The Surratt Society's  BOOTH ESCAPE ROUTE tour. It lasts all day, costs around $70.00 and is an absolute MUST for Lincoln Assassination enthusiasts. And if you can, Get Michael Kauffmann as your guide. His book American Brutus is fantastic and he loves to chat with participants.",1275955200,7,934,4.482352941176471
