8454587,4,B0052WNHZG,"In this double feature of Elvira's Movie Macabre, Elvira hosts two monster movies that aren't half bad. Problem is, they aren't half good either. Lol. Anyway, The Brain That Wouldn't Die would be a very boring movie, if it weren't for a good catfight, a couple of gore scenes, and a cool monster ending. This movie actually was way ahead of its time, including a man having his arm torn off, and there is a lot of blood. Pretty good for a movie that was made in 1959.
Then there is Manster. It has a man with two heads. Like most of the movies shown on Elvira's Movie Macabre, it is a slow movie, but it has a great payoff. Once the man sprouts a second head, there is a lot of destruction and action. Problem is, a lot of the action takes place in total darkness so it's hard to make out. But what the heck. The monster...oh excuse me...the manster looks cool.
And as always, Elvira is a hoot. And I would never watch either of these movies without her. She can make a bad movie bearable and entertaining.",1334793600,,1006,4.272251308900524
8454588,5,B0052WNHZG,"I assume some folks will buy this because they are Elvira fans. This is a glass half empty, glass half full proposition. Will the Elvira ""interludes"" add to your enjoyment of the film, a la the comedy skits that were woven into MST3K's version? Only you know for sure.

The big difference, of course, is that the MST3K DVD offered the MST3K version and the uncut MST3K-less feature film on the same disc. With this one, you get to watch Elvira, or fast-forward through Elvira. Caveat emptor. I'm not going to direct-link to the MST3K DVD in this review, because...sadly...it is out of print and is now selling for ridiculous ""collectors"" prices. If you want it, you can find it, I'm just not going to send the ""collectors"" any business. Movies were made to be enjoyed, not held for high ransom.

Because ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" fell into public domain, there are DVD versions made with inferior masters, and occasionally censored TV prints. The same thing happened with the same-era classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Horror-of-Party-Beach-The-Curse-of-the-Living-Corpse-Del-Tenney-Double-Feature/dp/B000C65YHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Horror of Party Beach / The Curse of the Living Corpse (Del Tenney Double Feature)</a>&nbsp;until Dark Sky films issued a ""definitive"" version endorsed by its director, Del Tenney. The ""uncensored"" bits on ""Brain"" are strictly cartoon-level, fake gore...but part of what makes it classic. The Elvira disc offers the uncensored version.

""The Manster"" is a quirky U.S. / Japan collaboration from 1962. Basically, a mad scientist injects stuff into your shoulder and you grow a second head. I hate when that happens!

I bought the DVD because, right now, this version of ""Brain"" is the only game in town. It deserves a quality, stand-alone version without ""interludes."" Lacking that, it's the next best option, because ""Brain"" is ESSENTIAL early-60s trash / B-movie / drive in / sci-fi entertainment.",1329696000,3,1998,5.584158415841584
8454589,4,B0052WNHZG,"I watch these movies mostly for Elviras comments not so much the movies.
this time Ihad to say something about the movie quality,the brain that wouldn't die print wasn't centered when they transfered it to dvd.the shots of Elviras comentary is right but the movie is off center one side of screen has a wider black band than the other you would think they would have cought that before making the dvd. the manster film is ok no problem with it. maybe they will watch that now and fix the brain that wouldn't die. thats the only complaint about this double feature.",1316649600,2,564,4.53921568627451
8454590,5,B0052WNHZG,"That hot toddy with the killer body, is back with this double feature (Elvira is a walking double feature) DVD from the new and improved ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"" series.

  In this collection, we have ""The Brain That Wouldnt Die"" (More like ""the head that wouldnt die""...this chick is the Headless Horseman's wet dream come true!!) and the weird film, ""The Manster"".

 In, ""The Brain That Wouldnt Die"", this dorky guy is driving with his girl....while doing so, he, for some reason (Meth addiction?) decides to hit the gas and drives a hundred miles an hour down a winding road with almost as impressive curves as Elvira herself.

 Yeah, you can pretty much draw your own conclusions as to what happened....the car...kerplunk...off a cliff like Wile E. Coyote.

  The man, after taking a tumble that would have killed King Kong, gets up, unscathed, only to find his girl stuck in the car, with.....uh, how do I put this.......lets just say that her head and her body were no longer connected.

  So, the man chooses head over body (typical guy) and takes only the head.

 He climbs back up the hill holding the head like a running back holds a football.

  The dorky guy, who not coincidentally, also happens to be a scientist, with the ""Frankenstein complex"", then hooks up his lover's head to.....I don't know...some machine with tubes running to and from the head, which keeps her alive (could happen).

 Well, the woman is ticked when she finds out that her head is sitting in a dish like an apple in a fruit tray on a dining room table.

 The dorky scientist then has a lightbulb go off in his head: ""Oh, I know, I'll find some hot babe with a knockout body, kill her, fling her head in an alley like a bowling ball, and take the body back to my lab and connect my sweetheart's head to the body"" (could happen).

 Well, it doesnt go quite as well as he hopes. How about we leave it at that.

As for ""The Manster"", the movie makers must have sprinkled some marijuana on their sushi, because you'd have to be fried to make a movie like this. It's kind of like a Frankenstein movie, only instead of mixing body parts, a scientist (scientists have some ""issues"" that need prompt mental medical attention, apparently) decides to take some reporter who acts like he has a pole stuck up the wazoo, and injects him with....something...that turns him into a two headed monster (could happen).

 Even Cheech and Chong and Harold and Kumar would say: ""This is some mixed up stuff, man"" while watching this movie.

You have to watch it to understand.

These movies, on their own, would be as entertaining as a root canal, but thanks to Elvira, that hot ""Piece that everyone wants to rest in"", the movies are not only watchable, but alot of fun.

 Elvira is hotter, funnier and more macabre than ever.

 Turn down the lights, have a Coke and your favorite snack handy  and enjoy this double feature.

It is sure to give you ""Unpleasant Dreams""....and a fear of scientists.",1310083200,3,2964,4.602294455066922
