2674800,1,B000JJSJUA,I purchased this item for my niece for her birthday and come to find out it will not work in any DVD player that her or I own. It would have been nice to know that it is not compatible with the DVD players here in the US. But if someone knows how to get it to work please let me know otherwise I just wasted $25.,1217376000,,312,3.671641791044776
2674801,5,B000JJSJUA,"Since I live in the good ole USofA I don't get to see Westlife in concert.  This DVD is the next best thing.  It is region 0, but since its PAL I had to play it on my laptop, it wouldn't work in the stand-alone DVD player.",1205280000,,222,3.702127659574468
2674802,5,B000JJSJUA,I was a total bum on New Year's Eve & sat in front of the Goggle Box_and watched Westlife Live At Wembley. It was fantastic! Definitely worth purchasing. You will enjoy totally it.,1201651200,,180,4.484848484848484
2674803,5,B000JJSJUA,"Westlife, you either love them or hate them, but no one can deny their talent.  These four young men from Ireland just continue to entertain year after year.  The group's annual concert DVDs are a great way for fans abroad to experience the Westlife phenomenon in their own living rooms.  It's the next best thing to being there!  This is one of their best.

On a technical note, this DVD is Region 0 (free) but is a PAL encoded disc (not NTSC as the description says) so it still requires a PAL converting DVD player in order to play it in the USA.",1199923200,6,549,4.29126213592233
2674804,1,B000JJSJUA,"Although this looks like a different DVD of Westlife, it is the same DVD
as ""Live at Wembley"" 2006 DVD.",1190419200,3,103,4.2
2674805,5,B000JJSJUA,These four men are amazing.  The energy delivered was awesome.  Shane is outstanding on this tour.  Mark is still the most gorgeous of the four witha voice like an angel..  You won't be disapointed.,1187913600,,198,4.735294117647059
2674806,5,B000JJSJUA,"The tour does leave out Westlife's traditional continuous ten-minute medley section in its setlist, but does include excellent big band renditions of their hit ""Uptown Girl"" and a ""She's Back/ Billie Jean"" mesh. The DVD's opener, ""Flying Without Wings"" is another highlight, and the best live version I've heard to date due to Mark's outstanding vocals.
Other highlights include ""World of Our Own"" and ""Mandy"" (Shane and Mark harmonize surprisingly well on this one). All in all Westlife sound great live on this DVD. Mark turned it up a notch and made the entire show a lot better (you don't have to put up with him missing many notes this time!)

2674807,4,B000JJSJUA,"Besides the release of ""Love Album"", Westlife also released their 2006 world tour ""Face to Face"" DVD.  This time, the whole show was recorded at Wembley! Mark is my favorite member in Westlife, but I find myself enjoying Shane more this time! Mark's performance is unsteady, while Shane performed better than the albums.  Finally, fans can listen to Nicky's and Kian's awesome voices again! Although Nicky's vocal is not strong, his voice is really soothing and gentle; Kian's vocal is surprisingly good, it makes me wonder why he doesn't contribute more to Westlife's album!

The tour consisted of classic Westlife songs (""Flying Without Wings"", ""Mandy"", ""Swear It Again"", etc), unexpected good old songs (""Seasons in the Sun"", ""Queen of My Heart""), new songs from the album ""Face to Face"" (""You Raise Me Up"", ""Hit You With The Real Thing"", ""Amazing"", etc), and exciting medleys! They also sang ""The Dance"", which is not a better version than the ""Love Album"" version, but I really love that song! Overall, another Westlife tour that should not be missed! Westlife will have their brand new tour in 2007, but until then, enjoy this DVD!",1166486400,10,1137,4.973684210526316

8151380,4,B000JJSJUA,"Not sure if I got the surround sound system right but this was the first Westlife DVD that I have bought. I only got it for You Raise Me Up and was a little disappointed that more of the other songs were not in that vein. The song also came up at the very end but was well done and presented.

Idk, but the concert, I kinda felt like I was there! They have WONDERFUL vocals and they had the best choreographed dance moves since they were all coordinated!

8151386,5,B000JJSJUA,"This DVD was a pleasant surprise. It was part of Westlife's ""Face to Face"" tour and had me jumping up and down and dancing the whole time! The best performance by far was the Lad's re-indition of ""Don't Cha"" by the pussycat dolls! There wasn't a dry eye in the house, when they sang ""Seasons of the sun""! You have never seen Shane, Mark, Nicky and Kian like this before - a definate collector's item!",1277856000,,400,4.346666666666667
