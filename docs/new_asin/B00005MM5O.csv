7945906,4,B00005MM5O,"This movie is about a woman who is hunting down the people who killed her parents as a child.  When she finds them, the woman (portrayed by Monique Gabrielle), seduces them into bed with them, then she kills them.  While going after one of the killers, she comes across his woman (portrayed by Rachel Vickers (aka adult film star,Raven)) Ms. Vickers puts on a tour de force performance during the sex scene with her husband.  Gabrielle's character discovers the couple making love, and fantasizes about making love to Vickers'character.  Eventually, Gabrielle works her way to getting close to the kingpin who ordered the hit, and they end up having spectacular sex on a polar bear skin rug by the fireplace.  Gabrielle's sex scene here is probably one of the best performances of her career.  Her orgasmic response is fantastic!  When the kingpin is about to come, Gabrielle's character chokes him out with a pair of fireplace tongs.  How fascinating, a reverse snuff scene in a softcore sex film.  That's something that you don't see every day!  It is at this point that the police detective (portrayed by Erik Estrada) enters the film, and somehow is involved with the killers in a surprise plot twist.  Gabrielle's character survives and moves on with her life.  I have not found any other films featuring Monique Gabrielle since this release, but if this indeed is her last film, she is going out with a bang.  I loved Ms. Gabrielle's performance in this film, and I wish her all the best.  Hip, Hip, Hurrah!!!",1099008000,17,1515,4.7992277992278
7945907,4,B00005MM5O,"I have to warn everyone first-I'm a Monique Gabrielle fan-so this is one sided.
 The story is about 'Angel',a girl put in the mental ward for killing her mom. When released,she goes to the only outside person she knows-her mothers last boyfriend, who coincidentally doesn't know how his girlfriend died in the past.
 Now-his current beau is not thrilled at all by the new houseguest and wants her out. So Angel tries to sabotage their relationship and remain in the house by whatever means necessary.
 'Hand that rocks the Cradle' coming to mind?Only without the kid. The subplot is Angels 'step dad' having business ties with Eric Estrada-an LA minor drug lord.
 But,B movie or not-I was pleased by Moniques acting prowess and seeing 'Ponch' play the other side of the law.
 For more info-watch the movie. But be a b-movie fan first-or you'll be going ""Ahh,geez...""",1018051200,11,866,4.863945578231292
