4229094,4,B003YGSL9Y,"Well, after reading the above review, I almost returned it.  However, my little girl saw the cover and kept saying ""cow"" and ""dog"". (the DVD cover pic). I do own Baby McDonald, and I have only viewed Neighborhood Animals. My 2 year olds like it....but they love puppets, all animals, and the older style Baby Einstein dvd's. For $10 I was not expecting an Emmy award winning movie....just another Baby Einstein DVD to add to our collection.  We like it.",1344729600,2,453,4.65
4229095,2,B003YGSL9Y,"Read the small print on the DVD cover - if you already own Neighborhood Animals and Baby MacDonald - do not bother getting this DVD. I thought Animals Around Me would contain new material, but most of it is identical to the aforementioned videos, which we already own. Unfortunately, my children quickly became bored with this video after one viewing. I am disappointed that Baby Einstein developed such a misleading product!!! If a video is being released as ""new"", then it should contain all NEW content and footage. The only thing that is new is the format. Very disappointing.",1332547200,19,580,4.8686868686868685
4229096,4,B003YGSL9Y,Not as entertaining and colorful as the World of Color DVD which my 7 month old loved. Pretty nice little movie nonetheless.,1325030400,3,124,4.681818181818182

4229098,4,B003YGSL9Y,"My 18 month old really enjoys this DVD.  She loves all the animals in it, and it maintains her focus.  The discovery cards were a nice bonus as well, but the print on them is upside down, so it is hard to show your toddler the card and read the discussion points. Hence the 4 stars.  Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for babies under 1 since the pace of the program won't keep their attention, but it is nice for older ones. Otherwise, a very cute and well designed program.",1302739200,5,486,4.318681318681318
4229099,5,B003YGSL9Y,My son has been sick a lot this season needing nebulizer treatments multiple times a day.  We put this video on for him to watch during the treatments and it is a huge help keeping him sitting still.  He loves it - especially the puppets!,1302739200,,238,4.266666666666667
4229100,5,B003YGSL9Y,My son loves the DVD.  He is 14 months I wanted to get him something he could learn from. Not plop him down to watch cartoons.  So it was a good buy.,1298937600,7,149,3.625
4229101,5,B003YGSL9Y,"I started my daughter who is now 18 months on the Your Baby Can Read dvds and she started speaking a little earlier. Once I tossed these discovery kits in the mix, her vocabulary has flourished. The videos are simplistic and appealing to the eye. The music that goes with the video helps to lull my little one to sleep as well at naptime.",1292544000,4,338,4.296875

4229135,5,B003YGSL9Y,Baby Einstein: Animals Around Me Discovery Kit ( DVD + CD and Discovery. I don't know what to say about the product because I bought the product for a gift.,1389139200,,156,4.233333333333333
4229136,5,B003YGSL9Y,Granddaughter loves it. Watches it all the time. Music soothes her and likes all the colors and shapes. Arrived in time for Christmas.,1388793600,,134,4.869565217391305
4229137,5,B003YGSL9Y,Fun animals pop their heads in from all over the screen. My kids love the bright colors and cheerful music.,1387929600,,107,4.4
4229138,3,B003YGSL9Y,Two of the other Baby Einstein movies are 'magic' for my 10 month old- this one is not. Probably because there's more farm animals than puppets- and for some reason the horses make him cry.,1385769600,,189,4.428571428571429
4229139,5,B003YGSL9Y,"My son loves all the Baby Einsteins!  He can't get enough of them!  We had to wean hm back off most because his doc said he was too young for ""screen time"", but he still watches them, and one is part of his bedtime routine!",1384992000,,223,3.933333333333333
4229140,5,B003YGSL9Y,"I have started my 5 year old grandson on this when he was 1 year old, my granddaughter on it when she was first born and now have it for two of my great grandchildren.  I think it gave them a head start for pre-k and kindergarten.",1381104000,,230,3.893617021276596
4229141,3,B003YGSL9Y,"Bought this for my 9 month old daughter, every time she's watched it, she gets to the same part (baby horses) and just starts crying until I turn it off.  I had my nephews watch it (who are 9 months and 2 years old), and they didn't cry, but only looked at it every now and then.  They just weren't interested at all, and usually those two are glued to the screen if Baby Einstein is on, interacting with it and talking with it (or babbling with the younger one).  From my point of view, it's very cute and goes through all the different animals by breaking it down to type (insects, birds, etc), but as interesting and cute as it is, it isn't as engaging as others we have seen.  I'd almost think my daughter isn't old enough for it, thus the crying, but we have the Neptune's Ocean which is also a Discovery Level 2 and she's loved that one since she was about six months old.  So, for whatever reason, my daughter hates/is scared of this one, but it just isn't a hit with any kids around me who's seen it, I'd save the money and get a different one instead (the colors, numbers, ocean and body parts ones have been the favorites for five kids I know).",1377561600,5,1154,4.203619909502263
4229152,1,B003YGSL9Y,All this is is a bunch of random videos of animals with classical background music.  Come on!  I can play youtube videos of animals muted while playing at the same time classical music that's free on the internet and get the same experience.,1377561600,,241,4.5813953488372094
4229153,4,B003YGSL9Y,I bought this for my grandson and he really is mesmerized by it.  I would recommend it along with Animal Safari.,1377388800,,112,4.333333333333333
4229154,5,B003YGSL9Y,I bought this for my niece. She absolutely loves it. I others but this is her favorite. I would recommend Animals around me.,1375660800,,124,4.434782608695652
4229155,4,B003YGSL9Y,"My 4 month old will probably be much more interested when she get a little older and will be able to imitate the animal sounds and identity each one,  Will continue to show her the video as a teaching tool.",1374883200,,206,4.15
4229156,5,B003YGSL9Y,I bought this and a few other Baby Einstein DVDs for my girlfriends 3 month old. He sat and watched them cracking up. Totally worth it to put a smile on his face!!,1373328000,,163,3.9696969696969697

4229160,4,B003YGSL9Y,My 20month old son loves to watch this! It keeps his attention for the most part and it must be working because I let him play with the animal cards and I ask him where the dog is and he grabs that card....same with cat.....It's a fun educational way to go over animals with your toddler or baby,1371168000,,295,4.103448275862069

4229172,5,B003YGSL9Y,"This video may be more appropriate even for children before age two years. We rarely let our granddaughter (and our daughter, Rylee's mom, is on the same page) watch TV. But this video is very appropriate for children age 2-4 years (maybe even a little before age two years.) it is interactive so parents can watch with their children and do activities with them. Or children can watch by themselves and get a great deal from it. Our most favorite Baby Einstein video is Classical baby or Baby Van Gogh.",1367625600,,503,4.6

4229175,5,B003YGSL9Y,"My 13 month-old son LOVES this video (as well as the other Baby Einstein videos).  The music and graphics are great.  I was hesitant to allow my son to watch these videos as I've heard TV is bad for children under 2.  I don't mind him watching these at all, however.  After watching them a few times, my son started saying the names of some of the animals featured in it.  He asks for it when he first wakes up, when he goes to bed and several times in between.  I couldn't recommend them highly enough!",1364515200,,503,4.1875
4229176,3,B003YGSL9Y,My grandaughter likes the DVD. The content is marging and only 30-40 minutes. Too short for the expense. Not going to buy new,1362441600,,125,4.478260869565218
4229177,5,B003YGSL9Y,"I purchased this kit as a Christmas gift for my 16 month old grandson, Noah. I received it in a timely manner , in time for Christmas. He loves it and picks up the remote control, stands in front of the t.v. and tries to get someone's attention to turn on his DVD! So cute! It also gives a tired adult a full 28 minutes of respite while he watches it nonstop! I'll be looking for others to order him soon!",1362182400,,405,4.012345679012346

There's a part where a treat is resting on a dogs nose and it shows the slow-motion clip of the dog bouncing the treat off his nose and into his mouth. My son laughs every time. We have other baby einstein DVDs but so far this one has impressed me the most with the calming music, cute puppet shows, and large variety of interesting animal clips.",1353715200,3,426,4.083333333333333
