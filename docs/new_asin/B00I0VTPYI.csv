6246380,1,B00I0VTPYI,"Extremely disappointed in the quality of this disc. I never thought a DVD could actually be poor quality, but I have decade old burnt discs that are much better played and more durable than this. I have quite literally tried this in FOUR different players. 2 of them, the audio cuts off entirely after the first episode if you select ""play all."" The 3rd will only play parts of the background audio, like one layer of sound, but not the actual speech. The 4th would at first play it with major skipping but now won't even read it at all. It's been kept in the case and just the transfer between players and case alone has left it super scratched. A cloud could brush ever-so-gently against this disc and it would be scratched beyond repair.

If you're going to make it so the only way to view a show outside of airtime on cable, AT LEAST MAKE THE DISC FUNCTIONAL. I bought this on Amazon for convenience, now if I want to return it I have to waste time and money which completely defeats the purpose.",1520121600,,1000,4.376344086021505

Within days you'll be able to recite every episode like a song that is stuck in your head. Speaking of which... yeah that happens too. But on the bright side, if you're like me, you get pleasure in asking your three year old to say Mayor Humdinger over and over and laughing because they say it different every time.",1482883200,,555,4.009009009009009

6246553,5,B00I0VTPYI,"This is a great collection of Paw Patrol episodes for the kiddos.  During long road trips the kids get to choose DVDs to watch, and this one is always a favorite.  The DVD is long enough to get through several episodes between pit stops (without having to change the disc).  Each episode is only about 11 minutes long, so it's easy to finish just one if that's what you need.

These episodes are all adventures of Ryder, Rubble, Skye, Chase, Rocky, Marshall and Zuma.  No Everest in this series, but these are all episodes that were written before she was a part of the show.

This is a good collection of different shows.  No theme or anything, just a good sample.

For your Paw Patrol obsessed kiddos, this is a good purchase.  Pretty inexpensive...and it buys us peace while road tripping!  It's a good value for something that can be used over and over again.  Paw Patrol Ready For Action!",1469577600,3,893,4.51875

6246576,5,B00I0VTPYI,"This show is a super hit with kids roughly ages 2-6. It's brightly colored, fairly action packed, and overly cutesy. Seems to be a hit with both boys and girls.  It's the opposite of a show like Max and Ruby or Little Bill or Veggie Tales. Your kid isn't going to learn a tough life lesson or really any lesson or value; nor will they be subjected to anything crude or questionable.  It's clean fun, just totally shallow.  The show attempts to have a ""smart character"" in Captain Turbot, who utters some 4th grade+ vocab whenever he gets into some self defeating predicament and must call the paw patrol to aid him. It's formulated after shows like Dora and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Solve some problem using a tool or going around something or what have you.  This just gives the same stories a ""high tech"" edge.

1. Dogs do silly things until the boy gets a call to help someone with a problem (often the mayor, a tugboat captain, or a little boy).

2. Dogs spend time going through action packed process of suiting up and saying catchphrases.

3. Problem is solved using 2 or 3 of the dogs' signature skills, roughly based on human occupations, and doubtless to have cost the taxpayers millions.

4. Dogs end show by doing silly things and maybe another catchphrase.

Kids will definitely be entranced by the bright colors and loads of pup accessories and action.  Despite its lack of substance, it's clean fun.  I dare you to watch with your kids and not hum the theme songs while you're at work.",1464220800,7,1498,4.552238805970149

Even her baby sister is getting in on the love for Paw Patrol at 3 months old, obviously she doesn't know what shes watching but it gives mom a chance to safely sit the girls down and have them be entertained long enough to take a break or to fix lunch.

She is learning so many things and she doesn't even know it, my only wish is that there were more girls! It doesn't seem to bother her though, in fact I don't think she even knows the difference since little, if any, emphasis is put on gender!

The Good: Play all feature means 2 straight hours of action without a single commercial. Plenty of 23 minute episodes for $10.
The Bad: Nickelodeon is nickel and diming this series to death. It's essentially a commercial for their over-priced toys. This is not a complete season 1, it's not collectable, its seemingly just a collection of early episodes for sale. I'm really giving this a hard time.

6246703,5,B00I0VTPYI,"I am always looking for shows that are appropriate for my 2 1/2 year old boy/girl twins to watch for inclement weather days or when we just feel like watching a little TV. I came upon Paw Patrol and thought this looked like a good show for them so I decided to buy this DVD since it was decently priced for almost two hours worth of episodes. My kids LOVE it! The idea behind Paw Patrol is it is a team of six puppies who all have specialties to help other animals or people in trouble. For example, Marshall is a dalmatian puppy who is a firefighter and drives a firetruck. Skye is currently the only female puppy who flies a helicopter. Their leader is Ryder, a 10-year-old boy, who picks which puppies he needs for each mission. Sometimes he will be on a mission with a couple of puppies and call for help from others as well. He has a phone that he can alert the puppies via their collars when they need to report to the Look Out, their headquarters, and once they arrive, they don their uniforms and are ready to help! When the puppies aren't helping, they are usually playing.

I love that this show is all about teamwork and helping others in need because I feel it sets a good example for my kids. The selection of episodes on this disc are great and I didn't find anything scary about them. In fact, my kids kept asking to watch more! I like that the episodes are short enough in case we only have a limited amount of time to watch them and we can pick and choose which ones to watch. I feel that the show is fairly gender-neutral since there is a good mix of males and females among the puppies, kids, adults, and other animals presented. I also feel that Paw Patrol is very appropriate for a variety of ages, from young toddlers to older children. Even I enjoyed watching it! As a mom, I feel very safe letting my children watch this show and will be purchasing other Paw Patrol DVDs and products in the future. I highly recommend this disc if you have a Paw Patrol fan and want a good selection of episodes to watch!",1444780800,,2028,4.267532467532468

Paw Patrol is very appealing to toddlers not only because of the adorable dogs and rescue missions - but because of the format of the show.  The catchy theme song draws the child in and then there is at least one sequence per episode where the pups ""roll out"" and the theme song plays again while they slide down the Lookout to their dog houses that transform into cars.

Although I'm not obsessed with the show, the show is great overall. The storyline of each episode teaches kids lessons, while enjoying all the adventures the show brings. The characters, probably the stars of the show are the pups, have different personalities and are super cute as well. The animation is also very well done; especially for me trying to be a graphic designer and major in 3D Animation.

6246831,5,B00I0VTPYI,"My daughter has recently moved on from Jake and the Neverland Pirates, and Paw Patrol appealed to her. I like emphasis the show places on teamwork and problem-solving, but I DO NOT LIKE THAT NICKELODEAN HAS FOR SOME REASON STARTED AIRING COMMERCIALS IN THE MIDDLE OF SHOWS. Oh, that makes me so angry! My four year old was asking me if I used Clorox wipes. Sweet mercy, whyyyyyyy? They include commercials for cars, shampoo, a tutoring service, cleaning products, a vacuum, women's products....NO THANK YOU. We only watch the Mickey Mouse networks, and if it weren't for our sweet sitter, we would have kept it that way. I'd rather give you $10, Nickelodeon, that expose my 4 year old to commercials.

But Paw Patrol is great, highly recommend the show. :)",1422144000,,756,4.770992366412214

6247023,3,B00I0VTPYI,"I really do.  However, my 19 month old daughter loves it.  So I deal with it.  I can't take the whining of a few of the characters and while the show does attempt to pass on life lessons, I wouldn't say its great for that.  Nobody ever gets mad, the grownups are idiots, no one has to think their way out of trouble, etc.  But there is a lot of ""please/thank you"" and be nice to people so it balances out.
Who really cares what I think about the show anyway.  Its a kids show.  Its not offensive, no twerking or blood letting so let the kiddies watch it.  Its a Canadian show , so the main characters accent always makes me laugh.  I think of the South Park song ""Blame Canada"" when I catch him saying ""aboot"".
