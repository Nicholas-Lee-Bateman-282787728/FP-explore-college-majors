4171057,5,B003QP4CNC,"Update, right now Target has this set with a bonus disc with the Pick/Pawn/Polish crossover special of AP, PS, and AR.  I picked it up for ten bucks since I never saw the special and gave my old set to a friend.

Just the first 8 episodes of Season 2, but still a good release and certainly worth the money in my book.  I know everyone is complaining about this not being Season 2, but the Volume format for releases of current shows is pretty much the norm recently wether is's History Channel or Fox (Family Guy etc.)

So 8 (1 hour) episodes for about 15 bucks is pretty good by most standards.  If they would have done all 26 (1 hour) episodes we would probably be paying like 50-60 bucks, so really you get what you pay for basicaly.  Nothing to complain about here...I'm sure more volumes will come as long as these keep selling.  So please don't hesitate on it because it's not a complete season...it's a great show and if your a fan it's worth picking up as I'm sure they won't scrap this format for complete seasons anyway, they'll just stop makeing them altogether if they don't sell.",1320883200,,1093,4.381188118811881
4171058,4,B003QP4CNC,"I saw Bill's main street hardware store on your show, and would like to know the adress to go and have a look around. GGGreat stuff, You can reach me at the email adress. Roger",1320537600,,176,4.057142857142857
4171059,1,B003QP4CNC,Just be warned. A great show to watch. But this is not season 2. Just 8 episodes from season 2. Seems they are milking this season for everything they can. Out side of this 8 show compilation. They have released other episodes on dvd as well. Like the civil war episode. 1 show on that dvd. So very sad.,1320278400,26,303,4.1525423728813555
4171060,1,B003QP4CNC,"Not sure why but this is not the entire Season 2 - it's only a handful of eps from the whole season - so, if you want the whole season don't buy this - and let the History Channel know you're pi$$ed.

I've tried to find out why it was released in this way through History Channel on Facebook and they proved they didn't even read my question by just directing me to thier website. An e-mail to them through their website went unanswered. My question was simply why it was released like this and if a complete Season 2 would (ever) be available. Guess it's a secret and they don't want my money.",1319500800,25,594,4.2105263157894735
4171061,5,B003QP4CNC,Great for anyone into collecting-Frank and Mike travel all over the country looking for what others think as junk and make their living doing this.  Great show!,1319414400,,160,4.925925925925926
4171062,2,B003QP4CNC,I love the show BUT am very disappointed why they only packaged 8 episodes. Last season they had every episode. Not right but I'm the dope for being taken in and not reading carefully. Buyer Beware!,1319068800,10,198,4.527777777777778
4171063,5,B003QP4CNC,"If you've ever looked at a pile of junk/garbage and thought ""Boy, I'd love to see what's all in there"", this is your show.  It's great fun and even educational.  You know, like going to garage sales or thrift stores with your mother who grew up during the depression and instinctively knows what every thing she sees in some stranger's garage is called and what is was, and could be, used for.
I'd say it's porn for the financially challenged.",1289606400,10,443,4.525

I had only made it halfway through season 2 of 9 seasons when Amazon took away its Prime status. Now it's $1.99 per episode. I am very disappointed.

The story is not just about finding rusty gems in other's stockpiles, but the people they meet along the way. A refreshing break from the negative orientation so much of TV has today. Yes, there is no doubt some made-up drama, but for the most part is appears as real. Who else would be picking amongst dead chickens and animal poop. Well done and great for the whole family!!",1419984000,,474,4.523255813953488

I'm always impressed with how kind they are to the collectors/hoarders they meet and visit -- Mike and Frank seem to enjoy them and their collections so much, I can only imagine how much the collectors themselves enjoy the visit. (I'm not sure how these visits are planned, or arranged or set up.  I'm sure it's not as spontaneous as it appears. Still, they make every program, every season, fresh and interesting.)

4171266,3,B003QP4CNC,"My wife and I love the show and have actually learned quite a bit but with that said, the two guys on the show Mike and Frank, seem to set their own values on many of the things they buy and their value is actually way below what the value should be.  Case in point is when they actually do take something to an expert, it is almost always much lower than what the expert says it is.  Frank is a pleasure to listen to and watch and Danielle the office girl is also a pleasure to watch and is probably the hardest worker of the three but Mike is off the chart annoying and comes across as arrogant, loud mouthed and belligerent.  If it were not for his attitude, I would give the show 5 stars",1404950400,,691,4.029197080291971

4171273,5,B003QP4CNC,"This is my favorite show.  The way that they interactive with one another is reminiscent of siblings.  Just enough banter to provide a light atmosphere while learning history.  For me it isn't really about the value of an item (although it is interesting), but more the value of what it represents to the buyer/seller.  The stories involving the items unlock a world that we didn't know about, a time we didn't get to experience.  Mike and Frank give us a glimpse into an era and into peoples emotions, giving a full experience.  If you like old things or miss hearing old stories from past relatives then check this out.",1404086400,,621,4.651376146788991

I am not a collector myself but the things Mike and Frank dig up and rescue from some pile somewhere, well, it's amazing. I get a big kick out of it just as they do. It's really great to see the wonderful old people they encounter, too, from all over the country. Maybe because I'm getting old, myself. I'm glad this show is on the air and I hope to be watching the intrepid duo continue with their antique archaeology and their antique anthropology for many years to come.

As the title of the review references, Mike and Frank the two main characters get dirty picking through peoples barns and garages all across the country in search for rare and interesting relics that they can buy and then sell, hopefully for a profit.  The finds are interesting, seeing what things are worth even more so, and the banter and back and forth between Mike and Frank and their partner Danielle keeps things rolling along.  A good fun show that while ""clean"" in the ratings sense of the word, shows you how much excitement can be had getting dirty and dusty!  Hope you enjoy!",1402963200,,735,4.674418604651163

I am always amazed at how many people there are in this country that hoard tons and tons of old junk that they will never do anything with and when they are offered good money for it they refuse because it has sentimental value.

4171313,5,B003QP4CNC,"Let's be honest this is a show about shopping. Yes they sell the angle about it being about ""Americana"" but they are just getting dirty shopping (which yes, may or may not be the quintessential model of an American). But the two pickers, Mike and Frank really sell the show. They make me care because they care so much about what they are doing. And not in that Richard Simmons rah rah kind of way, but in that kind of way that is missing a great deal in the modern day: sincerity. Yes it is about making the best deal, yes it is about making money, yes that means there is an element of greed. But, it gets under your skin in that cute puppy kind of way.",1393632000,,655,4.125

Learn so much from this show, about people, human behavior, and history from this show.  I admire Danielle, for her stamina and steadfastness, in working with two guys who are mostly away from the shop.  The guys have good reason, seems to me, to have such trust in this nice lady.

I love when  they go to different parts of the country and find so many different things, and the way some information about history of objects is shown to us viewers.  Great show.",1388880000,,634,4.460869565217391

Also their zest for knew information on items they've never picked before is incredible. Finally it's also about the relationships they build along the way. I love how you they respect the elderly to have allowedMike& Frank in their home & how these pickers feel honored to be allowed to see what amounts to going through someone's life. They can be raunchy in a boyish way, but never over the top. What I learn from watching this program is incredible.

I said he could not watch her comedies about sex. So we stumbled across American Pickers. We were hooked and went through the first season that weekend and started into season 2.

At time the guys pay to the camera, but they seem genuine and remind us of the great variety of people we have here in fly over country...and my wife said we should put them onto my uncle where they would be in pickers heaven. So they kind of remind us of the good, but eccentric side of the family.",1380326400,,635,4.162601626016261

4171365,3,B003QP4CNC,"I am involved in the antiques field, so is how it works. I find it interesting that the guys buy such low ticket items and then resell for such piddly margins. For example, they buy an advertising sign for $45 and resell for $65. And, have you noticed that there is very little ""sold,"" but rather the boys put their own ""value"" on the items.  All the gas, hotels, meals and etcs. of such a road trip would not begin to average out unless they filled the fancy Sprinter from top to bottom with other merchandise. However, they continually pass by items that could actually make them some money for a small amount of goods. Obviously, this is a ""made for tv show,"" that has little basis in reality... kind of like Antiques Roadshow. Nice to watch for the amazing people they meet, but no way an insight into the antiques world.",1379116800,2,825,4.427631578947368

4171395,5,B003QP4CNC,I love this program.  The characters they meet are very interesting and different.  I learn some history of the country and of items.  I enjoy the humor.  I started with season 1 and went through season 2 and now I am on season 3.,1368921600,,230,4.159090909090909
4171396,4,B003QP4CNC,Great Show. Educational and Awesome Classic Antiques. Funny and cool stuff. Great way to learn the classic stuff and more historical items.,1368748800,,139,5.363636363636363
4171397,5,B003QP4CNC,"I find the American Picker shows addictive -- like eating potato chips or popcorn.  I can never watch just one.  I like the banter between Mike and Frank.  Jokes and language are family-friendly.  Although sometimes appalled at the amount of ""rusty gold"" the pickers find, it is fascinating to see what they find and how much it's worth.",1368489600,,337,4.758620689655173
4171398,5,B003QP4CNC,It's great! Mike and Frankie are hilarious. It's really interesting to see how much someone else's junk is really worth.,1368144000,,120,5.05

4171400,3,B003QP4CNC,I used this in a middle school social studies class. I was quite surprised to find the pickers used profanity when it is not necessary. It would be a great tool to spark interest in history if it were G Rated.,1367366400,,209,4.121951219512195
4171401,5,B003QP4CNC,"Overall these guys are some pretty decent humans.  They're honest with their sellers.  There have been a few episodes where they paid way more for an item then the owner had asked,  infact in one episode they made 10k and took 5 of it back to the original seller.

It's a good ""coffee table""  tv program.  It has it's educational moments about the history.  Then it makes you feel better if your house is in a not so organized and borderline hoarder when you see these other peoples places.",1367107200,,490,4.438202247191011

Mostly its amazing to me to see what kind of old junkie stuff people will pay money for!",1366761600,,353,3.8219178082191783

OK, that being said...American Pickers is one of my favorite shows, the guys are ""real"" and I find it so interesting to see all of the junk they turn into treasures.

I think more people would subscribe to Prime if you put more American made movies and newer stuff.  I would pay a bit more for things that are newer.  Also, why no include T.V. shows that are currently playing?  So what if I watch it on my T.V. or on Prime?",1366761600,,573,4.0265486725663715

4171426,1,B003QP4CNC,I pre-ordered thinking I was going to get the complete season two after buying and enjoying season One. They are fun shows. This will be the last money they get from me. Looks like much of season two was re-runs from season one. They must be burnt out already. Or just real greedy. My wife was bored watching them so no big loss.,1332633600,,329,4.238095238095238

Still not worth $15.99.",1326240000,,299,3.838709677419355
4171429,2,B003QP4CNC,"They are ok episodes, and they are the first 8:

One Pony Town
Psychic Pickings
Easy Riders
Getting the Boot
Smooth Operators
Gordon's Gold Mine
Buddy's Booby Trap
Art of the Deal

American Pickers is entertaining, but not $2.00 an episode entertaining. (I mean these were paid for when they aired by advertising, and now it's just icing on the cake income, and you want $2.00 an episode!!)
I rented the first season, and thought ""That was cool, I'll buy the 2nd"", and then I get ripped off. (I mean at least the season 1 DVD was 12 episodes and a complete season).

Volume 2 (very clever ""Volume"" instead of ""Season"")
So clever that I won't be buying any more seasons, I mean ""volumes"".

The show is good, but whoever was in charge of ""bundling"" this product for retail sale, and decided to not only put 8 out of the 26 episodes, but try to charge $16 for it as well, needs to be fired!

But that has changed with this sad attempt, a marketing ploy designed to trick loyal fans. Instead the History Channel needs to apologize for their flim-flam  and do the right thing by selling the complete season. Ploy, trickery,  flim-flam, and fool are now the words used to describe the History Channel. Sad, very sad. Don't reward them for bad marketing, for bad behavior.",1321574400,13,538,4.774193548387097
