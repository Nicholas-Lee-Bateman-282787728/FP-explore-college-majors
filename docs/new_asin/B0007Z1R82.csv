 why, oh WHY, is this NOT on dvd???  With the sad loss of Disney Channel's late-night ""Vault Disney"" (and even Toon Disney losing
its sense of nostalgia), it's become more important than ever for
us die-hard Disney fans to find access to the shows and characters
we loved and grew up with. Ludwig von Drake and his ""kooky""
adventures are certainly among these. (Von Drake and I were
""born"" about the same year, 1961.)

The Von Drake stories featured by Walt Disney were both
educational and fun for young and old alike, and even some
of the older classics (such as ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" )
were much funnier when Ludwig narrated them!

""Music For Everybody"" and ""Fly With Von Drake"" are two more
examples of this. You get a look at some of the best bits
from ""Melody Time"" and ""Make Mine Music"", with Von Drake's
delightful intros in between; ""Fly With Von Drake"", accompanied
by Ludwig's narration (and his colorful 'alter-egos'), gives a fascinating look at the history of flight, featuring some of
the animation from the WWII feature, VICTORY THROUGH AIR POWER.
For those who feel that the bombing footage from ""AIR POWER""
is too violent and/or politically incorrect for our time, ""Fly
With Von Drake"" is a safe alternative...one more reason for
releasing this to DVD.",1182902400,5,1343,4.75107296137339

This video has 2 separate episodes from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show that played on Sunday nights from 1953 to 1983. The first is ""Music for Everybody"", originally aired in 1966 and again in 1970.  Professor Ludwig Von Drake is back, this time to teach us about about the importance of music. In ""Music For Everybody,"" the setting is the ""Von Drake Bowl"" a send-up of the Hollywood Bowl. Drake is hilarious as he puts on a tutu for Ballet. He sings opera and performs period dances with their respective music.  There are also featured tunes from Dinah Shore, Nelson Eddy, Benny Goodman. Added into the episode are scenes from the Disney's animated feature being promoted at the time, ""Sleeping Beauty,"". This is an enjoyable episode, clean family fare, and my son really enjoys it with me.

The next episode first aired in 1963. ""Fly with Von Drake"" has the professor discussing the history of man in flight.  Very entertaining while educating the viewer, it shows the many attempted methods of flight - both failures and success. It even includes space flight with some whimsical theories of possible Martian life. Terrific animation interspersed with old historical films.

I highly recommend this video and others in the series. Disney released many other titles from the TV episodes, just search on Amazon under ""Wonderful World of Disney"". To learn more about other episodes in the television series buy the book ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television, by Bill Cotter"", also available at Amazon.",1111536000,2,1645,5.010989010989011
