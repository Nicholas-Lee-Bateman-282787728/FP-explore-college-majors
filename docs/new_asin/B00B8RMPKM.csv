5563374,3,B00B8RMPKM,"A researcher (Andrew Duggan) and his assistant (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) arrive in Los Angeles to conduct interviews with middle class women on their sex lives. The film focuses on four of the female subjects: an adulterous housewife (Shelley Winters), a frigid widow (Jane Fonda), a self destructive nymphomaniac (Claire Bloom) and a kooky artist (Glynis Johns). Based on the best seller by Irving Wallace, itself a barely disguised steal from the (then) controversial Kinsey reports, the director George Cukor has his hands tied due to studio interference and the early 1960s morality which prevents any honest examination of suburban sex. The film wants to be ""daring"" but is reticent to call a spade a spade. What we get is a glossy soap opera redeemed by two performances. Jane Fonda, looking Movie Star glamorous in her Orry Kelly wardrobe, has the worst written of the roles and goes down fast. Glynis Johns does her best but her character is too precious and underwritten. But Shelley Winters brings a genuine pathos to her unhappy housewife and best of all, Claire Bloom takes the mediocre material and slams through it with a terrific performance so honest and real that she shows up the rest of the film for the ineffectual effort it is. With Cloris Leachman, Ray Danton, Ty Hardin, Henry Daniell, Chad Everett, John Dehner, Roy Roberts, Corey Allen and Harold J. Stone.

The anamorphic wide screen (1.85) Warner Archives MOD DVD-r is unrestored with what seems excess grain though eminently watchable.",1350000000,12,1509,5.036
5563375,2,B00B8RMPKM,"Lets face: its a nice movie (Soap Opera style) with a outstanding cast: Ty Hardin, Shelley Winters, Claire Bloom, Efrem Zimbalist jr., Andrew Duggan and a nice movie score. In other words: i like this movie.

But very dissapointing: the picture quality. Its very very corny (its grainy through the whole movie) and I would say not acceptable - the movie deserves a better quality.

Also there no subtitles.

In other words: I don't like the DVD",1348358400,4,444,4.740259740259741
5563376,4,B00B8RMPKM,"First off, the ""treatment"" by Warner Archive is the cause of ""The Chapman Report"" not receiving the full five stars as the source material used is not up to their normal standards, which is usually truly remarkable, but, remember, ""The Chapman Report"" which they are bringing to home video for the first time was released in 1962.  It was actually a bit of a milestone in bringing the new permissiveness to later become a norm in the cinema by filming Irving Wallace's sensational bestseller for the screen.  Wallace was the author who had a knack for finding truly spectacular bestseller topics and plots and here turned his attention to the prospect brought to us by the people behind ""The Kinsey Report."" (Some so sensational they were unfilmable).  The screenplay is by Wyatt Cooper and Don M. Mankiewicz with music by Leonard Rosenman and was directed by legendary George Cukor.  It is one of his best films.  The entire cast is top drawer, especially the centerpieces of Shelley Winters (the cheating wife); Claire Bloom (the nymphomaniac); Jane Fonda (the frigid widow) and Glynnis Johns (an ambivalent intellectual); as well as the men, including Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and especially Ty Hardin (his best role) and a young Chad Everett, among others.  Everything here is deserved of a place on most collector's shelves.  DVD includes a trailer.  In Technicolor.  Although the drawbacks to the transfer are quite noticeable, they are not for long distracting.",1347408000,12,1464,5.04149377593361

Shelley Winters gives a moving performance, but the real star, and the main reason to watch this, is Claire Bloom, as a woman tormented by her sexual needs.
