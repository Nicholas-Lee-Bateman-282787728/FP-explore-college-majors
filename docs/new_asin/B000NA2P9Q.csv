2764201,5,B000NA2P9Q,"I recently reviewed DanceCrazy.coms Swing Dance Volume 1 DVD and am excited to introduce Volume 2!  This is the second half of the complete Beginners Guide to Learn How to Swing Dance. This DVD picks up where Volume 1 left off and then takes you through the remaining beginner Swing Dance steps and patterns.
Learning how to dance using DanceCrazy.coms DVD system has become a family activity.  It is so much fun and so easy for beginners of all ages. The instructors provide step by step instructions and allow you to have fun while learning!  The Learn To Swing Dance! Volume 2 DVD is progressive so you continue to build on the skills learned during Volume 1.  Im understanding more about timing, footwork, patterns, and techniques.  The more I practice, the more comfortable I feel in my own dancing ability.  The most important thing is that the Learn To Swing Dance! Volume 2 is a great family activity that we all enjoy together.  The instructors teach everything in ways that are easy to understand and having them in your living room makes it super convenient.  DVD menus let you go back and review!  Each step is broken down thoroughly and the instructors teach the essentials on technique, style, and connection.  At the end of this DVD set, my family will no longer be beginners because we will have learned enough to move to an intermediate level of social Swing Dancing! All without expensive dance lessons! This two hour dance instruction DVD has helped teach my family the basics and provided a solid foundation from which we can continue to learn and improve.  Just having fun together has been the most important aspect!
DanceCrazy and Salsa Cray have a whole line of instructional dance DVDs and videos available on Amazon. Stay tuned as I bring in some friends to learn to dance using some of the other amazing dance line products available.

2764204,5,B000NA2P9Q,"So happy that i invested in the second edition. This tied all the swings, dips, and locks together. This was just as easy to follow as the first edition. I may not be a professional at swing dancing now, but i feel much more confident doing it. I really want to share this dvd with my friends so we can go out and have a great time! Thank you for bringing back some great memories from my past!",1414627200,,394,4.064102564102564
2764205,5,B000NA2P9Q,I don't know what the others are complaining about because this is actually a really good guide on learning. My wife and I were able to learn fast and in the correct way. I think the complainers just didn't put enough time into learning. Great product!,1414108800,,252,4.5
2764206,1,B000NA2P9Q,"Too few steps included, the jerk always went too fast, and it should have had more music to practice with",1408147200,2,105,4.3
2764207,2,B000NA2P9Q,"Quality is great, teachers are great but there just isn't enough dance steps to warrant the $40 per DVD....basically there are 3 steps plus a dip step that most likely will not be danced or seen on the dance floor.",1200009600,7,214,4.375

8176528,5,B000NA2P9Q,"Every DanceCrazy dvd has been easy to follow and full of helpful advice and tips. The moves are displayed slowly and at full speed, and fully explained by the excellent hosts!
I can't believe how quickly I am learning, and DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who wants to learn Swing.

Directions are very detailed and easy to follow, and the charm of the instructor(s) helps command attention!

*I received this at a discount for my true and unbiased opinion",1424736000,,459,4.7974683544303796
8176529,5,B000NA2P9Q,"Finally got to watch and use these lessons! We started with volume 1, which was really helpful (takes away any excuses from beginners). This next level is good because it picks up the pace and the interest without going too fast for you to follow. They make every move clear and easy to understand, and most important: it's FUN.  (If you have someone on the couch, refusing to try... they will eventually cave and admit that DVD lessons work & it's more fun to Get Up and Get Moving!)
These swing lessons opened up a whole new activity -- and it's like there's a secret world of swing dance out there, people and places to go use what we've learned.",1420934400,,649,4.408333333333333
8176530,5,B000NA2P9Q,"I received both Swing 1 & 2 for review and Eldon and Alison are back in this DVD. This is a straight continuation of the first DVD, so to be able to follow along with the moves in this DVD, you must have learned the basic steps in the first one.

They continue in the same teaching style with a demo of the move, the men's breakdown, the women's breakdown, danced together, and then danced to music. You'll have plenty of time to master each move before you move on to another.

In this DVD, you'll learn the Hammerlock, the Women's Tuck & Spin, the Arm Slide, the He Goes, She Goes, and the Dip. All very cool-looking continuing moves for the Basic step. Each move is shown for both the City Swing and the East Coast Swing, so you'll be fluent in all of the moves for both types of Swing.

Extras on the DVD include Tips, the 3 Different Types of Swing, and Social vs. Competitive. These DVDs teach you social swing dancing for getting out on any dance floor, so those tips advise avoiding any of the crazy Swing dancing stunts you might have seen in the movies...for your safety and others'!

This DVD is a must for finishing your beginning Swing education, and will show you lots of stylistic moves to keep your dancing fun and interesting. I loved learning Swing, and these instructors are the best.",1419552000,,1303,4.394190871369295
8176531,5,B000NA2P9Q,"The second installment of the Swing Dance collection - over 2 more hours of great instruction and education on Swing, which is one of the hardest dances to learn.  In the first DVD you learned the basics of the dance like the Basic Step or City Swing, the East Coast Step, Release Break, Right and Left Underarm Turn, and the Right & Left Turn as well as the Cuddle.  In this DVD you will learn moves like the Hammerlock, Women's Tuck & Spin, The Arm Slide, The Dip, and you will also see the entire dance all put together so you can practice along with the instructors. SalsaCrazy has a lot of different dance DVDs that you can purchase, and if they are all like this one then you can be a complete novice at dance and still become a master in no time!  Plus it's not like paying for a one-time class where you don't get instruction if you fall behind - this allows you to practice and watch anytime you want and go back to master different steps if you need to.  Awesome set, make sure you pick up both DVDs to really master the entire dance!  Then you will be right on par with all those stars on tv you watch!  Fun and easy :)  I received a complimentary product to test.",1419206400,,1175,4.195555555555556

8176533,5,B000NA2P9Q,"Learn to Swing - Beginners Vol. 2 picks up directly where Vol. 1 leaves off, which features a male  and a female instructor giving you information on technique, style and teaches you the importance of connection with your dance partner. You'll learn how to dance the single and triple count East Coast Swing.got the product for testing purposes/ for free in exchange for an honest review",1419120000,,387,4.863636363636363
8176534,4,B000NA2P9Q,"I'll start out by mentioning the little fact that I have always had two left feet and had no desire to learn how to dance until I started looking into low-intensity workouts. These types of DVDs from DancyCrazy.com is exactly what I was looking for as the instructors give you a step-by-step process for each dance.

Learn to Swing - Beginners Vol. 2 picks up directly where Vol. 1 leaves off, which features a male (Eldon) and a female (Alison) instructor giving you information on technique, style and teaches you the importance of connection with your dance partner. You'll learn how to dance the single and triple count East Coast Swing.

While I did enjoy trying out the Learn to Swing - Beginners Vol. 2 for the most part, I can't get over the cliched flooring and the yellow curtains in the background that is used for a couple other DanceCrazy.com releases. The DVD is helpful for beginners, but if you already know how to dance, then you probably won't find the DVD very usefully. Overall, Learn to Swing - Beginners Vol. 2 is meant to viewed by people who can't dance (like me). It is not as good as the first volume, but I thought it was still a bit of fun.

8176535,4,B000NA2P9Q,"I like that the DVD shows the steps from both the male, and female point of view, then together before adding in music. It slowly adds to a routine step by step. During my review I think it's very easy to follow, and pick up on. The only thing that would make it better is to have a professional there letting you know for sure if you're positioned correctly.",1418947200,,359,4.217391304347826
8176536,5,B000NA2P9Q,"I'm a beginner dancer, as far as swing dancing, and this has taught me alot. It has basic steps, with a few dip steps but overall it is a great DVD. It is simple to follow, and gets right to the point. Along with other dance dvd's, I use this dvd as part of my workout when wanting to burn calories.",1418688000,,299,3.918032786885246
