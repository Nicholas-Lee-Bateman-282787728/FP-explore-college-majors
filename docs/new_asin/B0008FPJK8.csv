2258651,4,B0008FPJK8,"I see all of the reviews on here are talking about how amazing Degrassi: The Next Generation is as a TV series. And, I cannot agree more. This show is totally and completely worth watching. My best friend uses it to show her nieces and nephews to teach them life lessons about meeting people online, eating disorders, etc. It is a very intense show, in a good way.

But I'll make a couple comments on the product itself. This will be my second round at buying all of the seasons. (I must have misplaced them all in one of my numerous moves) The first time around, the disc set came in very small, compacted packaging. The DVD cases weren't very large. I liked this aspect since having 14 seasons can really take up some DVD realty! I just ordered from this seller and noticed the packaging is not what is shown in the description. It is large. It is the size of 5 regular size DVD cases. I also noticed that there is Spanish writing all over it. Almost inferring that this is the Spanish version. (Mini panic attack!) But I quickly put it in and found it is in fact in English. Yay! This is the only reason I give it 4 stars. As far as the actual show, shipping time (Amazon prime!) and it not being damaged upon receipt, this is a great buy!! Can't beat an entire television show season for only 20 bucks! Satisfied. :)",1429747200,,1320,4.301204819277109

2258681,4,B0008FPJK8,"I liked this a lot just not as much as the original.  I'm not sure if I like the way they integrated Joey into the new cast.  Seems a little forced.  This version is a little more airbrushed than the original and not as realistic I think.  This is the first indication to me that Degrassi is moving in the Hollywood direction.  Although I'm glad they use Christine's daughter Emma as the central character, I wonder how long it will be before all the old characters disappear.",1399852800,,476,4.425287356321839

2258689,5,B0008FPJK8,"Season 2 of DTNG is simply one of the best seasons of all time. The acting was decent to great with Jake Epstein and Lauren Collins having stand out performances and storylines with Paiges rape and Craig with his abusive dad. All the storylines were good to great. There really isn't much to bitch about here and I can't say anymore how good this season was. The season ends with a superb Finale and actually leaves you with goosebumps, even I got choked up a bit in the end, but I won't spoil it. So if your a degrassi fan and you haven't seen this season yet go and pick it up, it's definitely worth the 20-30$.",1393545600,,613,4.247863247863248

2258718,4,B0008FPJK8,"The second season of Degrassi: The Next Generation separates itself from the first by covering more grown up storylines, introducing interesting new characters, and taking the show to a new level overall. This season, half of the cast enters their freshmen year of high school, and a range of high school issues come to light.

The season immediately starts off with an extremely difficult topic--child abuse. And we get an introduction to a great new character, Craig Manning, who get to see deal with the issue first hand. Craig is the new kid at Degrassi. Aside from being a mysterious loner, he has a dark side that he hides from the people around him. His dad abuses him. And this isn't the only extreme issue dealt with this season. We get our first closeted gay character, Marco Delrossi, whose coming out process is displayed wonderfully on screen. Another new character is Ellie Nash, a feisty punk rocker with an independent attitude.

The new characters add a lot to season two, but the characters we grew to know and love in season one go through a lot this season as well. And the range of issues they go through are more grown up as well. Some of these issues include rape, an eating disorder, and underaged drinking. We also see some common issues that most teens face on a day to day basis; dating, homework or just fitting in with the right crowd. These are all important parts of high school, and we all know it because we've all been there.

Degrassi continues to address major milestones that teenagers face everyday, while also giving us a bit of light hearted humor to go with it. The show never fails to present its characters and their issues in an honest, frank manner that fans of the show will relate to. This season shows more of a mature side to the characters we got to know in season one, as well as some new ones. If you enjoyed season one, I recommend buying season two to watch your favorite characters continue to grow and develop and face all the problems that come along with being a teenager.",1216857600,,2030,4.571428571428571
2258719,5,B0008FPJK8,"Season 2 intoduces a couple of new charectors, Craig, Marco, and Ellie, as well as bringing Joey back after just two episodes the year before. It also deals with bigger issues, such as child abuse, rape, and homosexuality.

2258720,5,B0008FPJK8,"Season Two does two things in the beginning of the season.  Picks up where the cast left off last season.  Ashley Kerwin's character has the biggest transformation then anyone from the original cast.  Gone is the Mandy Moore clone Ashley and in her place is an Emo looking more introspective Ashley.  Another interesting aspect of Season Two is the introduction of Craig Manning into the series.  Craig's character deals with physical abuse from his father which is dealt with in the first two episodes of the seasons and the last two.  Craig's interaction with Manny Santos and Ashley Kerwin are foreshadowing his relationship with them both in future seasons.  Season Two also deals with touchy subjects like teen drinking, eating disorders, racism, self-image, abortion, rape, sexual identity, and death.  This season also continues two of Degrassi great love affairs.  Liberty Van Zandt & J.T. Yorke.  Sean Cameron & Emma Nielson.  This second season really begins the ups and downs that Semma (nickname for Sean & Emma) will go through the length of the series.  As the same with Liberty & J.T. Some say Degrassi is overrated, I say the exact opposite actually.  It's as close to the average teenagers experience of teenage life a teen show can be and the second season is no different.",1204588800,,1291,4.948837209302326
2258721,5,B0008FPJK8,"Degrassi: The Next Generation is a school-centered soap opera aimed at both teens and adults.  It is a spinoff of the 80s TV show Degrassi Junior High and features a new group of students at Degrassi Community School as well as many characters from the original series that are now grown up and facing issues and problems of their own.

There are so many things that make this show a success.  The cast is picture perfect.  This is not the type of series that casts 25-year-olds to play someone in 9th grade.  The team behind Degrassi goes for realism all the way.  Because a they have a 14-year-old actor play a 14-year-old character, it packs a more dramatic punch when we see the sometimes very troublesome situations the characters get themselves in.  This isn't a hilarious teen comedy show like Saved By the Bell.  The characters are all three-dimensional and you won't find any stereotypes.  The cast of young actors represents a true cross-section of the sort of kids you would see in real life.

As far as the storylines go, the superb first season dealt with many issues, such as teen drinking, internet stalkers, final exam stress, and in the season finale, the show became darker as one of the main characters, Ashley, overdosed on Ecstasy at a party.

Here, in the second season, the stories get even darker.  Ashley spends the majority of this season dealing with how her behavior in the season one finale ruined her social life.  Paige, the snobby rich girl with a heart of gold, learns the hard way that to some guys ""no"" doesn't always mean ""no.""  Marco, a new character introduced this season, must deal with his sexuality.  As for the adults, Emma's mother, Christine, decides to marry her boyfriend, science teacher Archie Simpson.  On the eve of her wedding, she finds out she is pregnant.  Archie has specifically told her he doesn't want kids so she freaks out...what should she do?  Joey Jeremiah deals with his dead wife's son Craig after it is revealed that Craig's father has been SEVERELY beating him (in one of Degrassi's most painful-to-watch scenes ever).  There are many more interesting stories weaving throughout this season and it never lets up.  This is definitely indicative of the even greater stories to come in the later seasons!

On to the DVDs themselves.  Degrassi: The Next Generation is filmed in widescreen, but for some reason, the powers-that-be have decided to release the show on DVD in fullscreen pan and scan.  This is disappointing, because Degrassi is a bigger-budgeted show and every episode has a movie-like quality to it.  The cropping of the picture is obvious and to have the episodes as they were originally shot would be nice.  Otherwise, the picture quality is perfect, at least as good as originally broadcast.

There are three discs of episodes and then a fourth disc with a TON of special features.  SuperFans of Degrassi (you know who you are) will eat this stuff up.  There are over 130 deleted scenes, audition tapes, and much more.

All in all, Degrassi: The Next Generation is a wonderful series that anyone can enjoy.  Even though there's the whole annoying no-widescreen issue, this is definitely a solid DVD set.  Definitely buy this and the rest of the series! You won't be disappointed!",1187395200,2,3261,4.811151079136691

It's important that people take the show, not as a perfect or pure description of High School, but a picture of what teens go through, and what can happen.",1166918400,,561,4.490196078431373

2258728,4,B0008FPJK8,"To me this is a very entertaning show, with good adolescent actors. The thing is, the star actors aren't 20 somethings, they are in fact kids, giving Degrassi a degree of realism other shows do not have. Numerous contemporary issues are addressed including drug use, self mutilation and eating disorders. Additionally, they have some fun, such as forming rock bands and just hanging out. However this show isn't reality tv and thus the episodes are used to portray acute issues moreso than the often ho hum existence of a 15 year old. This isn't a negative, it's just the way the show is presented. Graned it isn't going to win every award, but there are many genuinely good performances. And given the ages of the main ensemble and the nature of the show's format , I can live with that.",1148169600,,788,4.635714285714286

2258730,5,B0008FPJK8,"In my opinion, Degrassi is the best & most realistic show out there. Anyone who says it's not realistic apparently doesn't know what they are talking about. I'm 16 years old...& I can relate to EVERYTHING that happens on the show. In respone to another review, the idea of Terri being an overweight model is not telling us that it's morally right to be obese. It's telling us that we should be comfortable with our weight, not feel like we are worthless, which Terri experiences in the show. The show isn't boring just because the teens are getting caught in everything...they take ritalin, they get caught. It's supposed to teach us that when we do these things, we'll probably get caught...so DON'T do them. That's it. Normal teens can relate to everything in this show...these are everyday things that happen a lot...you just don't know about them. I can tell you, in my high school, I hear basically everyday abot someone either drinking, doing drugs, or having sex...so anyone who says it isn't realistic doesn't know what they're talking about!",1132963200,2,1050,4.838888888888889
2258731,1,B0008FPJK8,"(note: the following comments apply to all seasons)

This is a really awful show. I mean, it's not as bad as most of the crap on Noggin, but it's still pretty awful. Which is sad really, because the writers do try to make it a good show in their own eyes. And, apparently, the eyes of any 12-year-olds who are dumb enough to believe this crap, which is nothing more than propaganda cheaply disguised as drama, encouraging kids to eat all their veggies and stay virgins for their whole lives.

Okay, enough trash-talking. It's time for me to explain WHY this show is so awful. Sadly, it's not one big simple thing. It's a whole bunch of big simple things. I'll start with the one that bugs me the most: unforgivably inaccurate representations of every single ""issue"" (translation: newspaper headline) that the show ""deals with"" (translation: poorly uses as a plot device). For example, take the Season 1 finale ""Jagged Little Pill"". In this episode, a character named Ashley (the only tolerable one in the bunch) takes one hit of Ecstasy and starts speaking gibberish, losing motor control, and doing a few other things. The problem here is that Ecstasy doesn't do ANY of the things that happen to Ash in this episode! Ash then spends the entire summer in Rehab, which no one in the real world goes to unless they're ADDICTED to something. Example number two: a character named Toby, downcast about being circa 50 pounds overweight, forgoes solid food. He lasts about 2 or 3 days at the most before fainting. Sorry, but in the real world, you'd have to get to well below 100 pounds and stay there for a while before you pass out from a lack of calories. In this same episode, a girl who must weigh at least 200 pounds gets a job as a plus-size model and lays the smackdown on a fast food clerk who mocks her physical condition. What's the moral of the story here? That it's okay to be morbidly obese?

Alright, second problem. The characters are all horribly one-dimensional stereotypes who lack the brainpower that God gave a jellyfish. Whenever a character is placed in a situation that involves any kind of decision-making, they can always be counted on to take the stupidest, most irrational course of action that the writers can get away with. Said characters are as follows: the Big Dumb Immature Jock (Spinner), the Glamour Queen With Minions (Paige), the Class Clown (JT? or is it TJ?), the Clueless Crusader (Emma), the Token Angry Black Guy (Jimmy), the Token Fruitcake (Marco), the Bad Boy From a Broken Family (Sean), two Smart People With Glasses Who Are Horribly Out Of Shape (Liberty and Toby), and two people (Ashley and Craig) who almost resemble real, normal people. There's also Manny, who originally had the personality of a toaster and was only on the show to give Emma someone to talk to other than her computer; later, the writers decided to make her the official Tramp Wannabe. Every single one of these characters has been seen on at least a dozen sitcoms before, and almost as many real-world high schools.

Problem number three. Everyone gets busted. Always. For everything. This makes the plots EXTREMELY predictable, and predictable plots are never a good thing. Jimmy takes Spinner's Ritalin prior to a basketball game? Gee, he got kicked off the team, what a shock! Craig cheats on Ash with Manny? Oh, I'm sure Ash will NEVER find out... so boring. It's counterproductive, too: the characters never regret their actions out of guilt, only out of punishment. What's the lesson? It's only wrong because you got busted?

Fourth problem. Lack of realism and balance. For example, the two smartest kids in the school, as previously mentioned, both wear glasses and are horribly out of shape. Smart people in the real world are just as physically fit and can see just as well as the rest of us. Also, I've noticed that the ONLY time the characters ever have sex is in the context of cheating. Nobody ever has sex with the person they're actually dating. Why? Because God forbid that anyone who watches this show get the impression that losing your virginity in High School won't totally ruin your life.

Anyway... I have a million and one other gripes with this show, but I think I've said enough. I will admit that this show is EXTREMELY addictive, even for someone who hates it as much as I do, and it's a bit better than the likes of Boy Meets World or Beverly Hills 90210. And I do kind of have to respect what the writers are trying to do with all the Aesop's Fables B.S. But really, if you want a quasi-realistic High School drama, watch Boston Public, or at least Freaks and Geeks (a very overrated show IMO). But for the love of all that is good and holy, if you don't want your brain turned into grape pudding, then stay away from Degrassi.",1127779200,18,4773,4.649289099526066

While I am a big fan of season 1, I absolutely LOVE the second season. And you don't have to worry about not getting your money's worth, you will, and trust me it is so worth it! One hint though; the first episode, When Dove's Cry, is a two-parter. However, the second part is not included as another episode but is at the very end of the first part.

2258738,4,B0008FPJK8,"My review of the Season 1 DVD was constructive criticism of the packaging and the way the DVds were. It seems that someone must have listened! These discs are silver colored,and have serpeate titles for each episode. There is also an option to add 5.1 surround sound.

However,there are no still no closed captions,nor are there subtitles (in English, French, or Spanish)

OK are you listening; Season 3 should include those captions and commentary on ""Accidents will happen"" from the writers of that epusode and Cassie Steele.

while we're at it,Season 4's DVD should be in 16:9! and Season 5 should have much less of Craig. This is Degrassi,not the Jake Epistien show.

Getting back to the season, the show was well done like the first season. Picture quality has improved on the DVDs. Each episode is presented as orginally directed,so When Doves Cry has the Craig tries to kill himself scene even CTV lacked the courage to show.",1119484800,3,932,4.8427672955974845

I remember years ago hearing about Degrassi this and Degrassi that, all of it concerning ""The Next Generation"" cast of kids.  Little did I know that I was missing out on a terrific show that is so much more than pretty faces trying to pull off a soap opera.  This show puts to sleep all those fake shows and opens our eyes to pretty much the real deal of current times that kids face in public junior high & high schools.  Characters like Ellie and Craig (portrayed beautifully by Stacey Farber & Jake Epstein) show controversial situations that kids sometimes face and deal with on their own.  There are issues that arise in the show that are all too hauntingly common with the real deal.  Canada really has a brilliant show in their grasp and it is one I will stick with, as long as the dvds keep on coming out.  The dvds offer everything a Degrassi fan could hope for.  The blooper reels are always funny, the rehearsals are interesting (seeing in how that person was cast as their particular character)...and of course so much more.  Plus Season 2 is when the action really starts to come into play.  So what are you waiting for?
