8589566,2,B00D4G0KSY,"This ""Blu Ray"" is advertised to be ""Playable in Region B-2 ( Overseas ) and Region A-1 ( North America ). I tried it in my Samsung BluRay player and nothing happened. If you live it in North America don't be a sucker like me..... Shame on you German BluRay people.....",1469318400,,268,4.2745098039215685
8589567,2,B00D4G0KSY,"The description implied that this recording could play on my machine, but it didn't.  I'm sure the recording is fine, but it was a waste of time here.  I suppose if I was more knowledgeable about the Blu-Ray process that I would have known better.",1379030400,,247,4.466666666666667
