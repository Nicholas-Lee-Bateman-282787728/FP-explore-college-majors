8259874,4,B0015TT2YK,Have been training for 25 years. Each of the mind - muscle tips surprised me with how efficient and more enjoyable my weight training sessions have become after having incorporated Vic's exercise form tweaks and training philosophy. Wish I came across this in my twenties.,1414454400,,272,5.066666666666666

His technics place more stress on the muscles wile using less weight and place less stress on your joints. This guys work is great. You can find his stuff on YouTube as well. I would recommend the mp3 format so you could take it with you to the gym. Best money I have spent in a wile.",1391558400,,532,3.9813084112149535
8259876,1,B0015TT2YK,"This is one of the worst investment i made in my life. Let me break it down so it easy for you to see what i am talking about:
I am 27 years old in good shape. I have been working out for almost 5 years. I thought buying this product is going to change my workout routine. I paid $50 for the whole package that includes 3 things 1) Vic's Natural Workout "" I am reviewing here"" 2) The Band workout version 3) audio workout.

audio workout: come on who is stupid enough to buy such thing well I did. when I included it in the package I was thinking I will get condensed and important information about bodybuilding life style nutrition........ ....looking at Vic's body you would think he would provide us with latest and most reliable information out there in the field. Guess what! the Audio was him talking about almost the same thing included in his YouTube Channel.

Band workout: who really care about the band workout I am not even going to review it. I just got it to have more exercises.

Vic's Natural Workout: well this is why you are here right! Let me tell you do not waste your money and just go and watch his YouTube Channel it has 92% of the stuff on the DVD in fact his channel has more stuff. yes I paid $50 for information that was provided on YouTube for free and I feel bitter about it.
Vic added to section one for diet and one for home workout in this DVD. Again I was expecting to hear pure knowledge but Vic put it short. He tells us that every one is different and to eat grain carbohydrate, vegetables, fruits, and protein. He wants us to stay away from soda, sugar, fat. he stated his diet knowledge in 5 minutes which show you how much he cares about giving us the right information lol. He never mentioned how to supplement for workout, how to bulk , or how to get cut and shredded.

His home workout is a joke too.

These products did not carry out his knowledge that he gained in 25 years of workout. I was misled by Vic's shape and the price of the DVD product.

so who should buy this DVD ? I would say if you are beginner and you want to start in good form you should use this DVD for the first 1-2 months and then switch to something different. personally I am saving The DVD for my little brother who is 14 years old and I am not joking here I think Vic DVD is good for people who have no clue about working out.

For anyone has more than a year of experience in the gym you need 4% of the information in this DVDs.

Finally I really respect Vic and I will still follow his YouTube Channel but I will never buy any of his other products in the future.

==========================================
Well after a year and a half I am coming back and I will tell you even If you are a beginner do not buy this product. Right now I am in the best shape of my life because of the diet program I am following. If you are trying to be in shape change the way you eat it is %70 of the work you need. I read it in two books then I tried It and it does work. "" VIC's NATURAL"" does not teach you any thing about nutrition or supplements.

I do not know about you guys but for me as a beginner I used to look at the big guys while they work out and I tried to observe the exercises, sets, and reps they went through. Every time I do that I get more lost. How we do almost the same exercises but their bodies looks way better than mine. Than my little brain makes me think you know what it most be the supplements they take so I usually go a head and asked them for advises including the name of the supplements they take. surprisingly we use almost the same stuff most probably different brands but it is the sameb. I used to think that those big guys must lie to me because they do not want me to be in a good shape lol. It get worse when they tell me you got to watch your food it is the key and because I am so smart I never believed them lol. I thought they are keeping the golden secret some where in their supplements cabinet. How not to think so when there is billions of dollars industry that meant to mislead us.

This is getting long so to make it short your shape is going to be the result of %70 your diet %30 your workout. Read good books from amazon or any other resources. To do the exercises in the right form watch youtube. Avoid Garbage ""sorry but it is true"" like this or any other working out program that does not teach you about nutrition. If you know why you should do something then you will figure how to do it. I am not going to put any names for any product or books here because I do not want my review to loss its value and sounds like any other cheap marketing we see on daily basis.

It is sad to reach this shape when I am 29 years old. I would've been a lot of fun if I was in this shape when I was in college :(

I know this a long review but it is going save you a $50 you were about to spend and probably couple thousands of dollars you were going to spend in the wrong place in the future. Not to forget it will save you couple years of work that's not going to pay off.",1362528000,15,5028,4.016
8259877,5,B0015TT2YK,"I saw vics workouts on youtube and knew I needed to buy his dvd so I checked his website and Geeezzz it was expensive! So I amazon it and sure enough I found it for dirt cheap and bouht it and haven't looked back, my workouts have been amazing since purchasing this dvd and it shipped pretty quick. :)",1323302400,2,301,4.11864406779661
8259878,5,B0015TT2YK,"Vic is the Bob Ross (the painter of 'Happy Little Trees') of bodybuilding.  He breaks down the mechanics of bodybuilding, nutrition, a workout for when you are at home and can't make the gym.  His motto is train smarter, not harder.  Attention to detail, making a connection with the muscles you are training is the theme, not how much you can lift.  This is body building, not body breaking.",1320192000,,392,4.63768115942029
8259879,4,B0015TT2YK,"I bought the DVD after watching Vic's videos on Youtube, thinking that the DVD would provide much more details than the videos that he's posted on Youtube. Well, as it turns out, the DVD is mostly a collection of the very same videos on Youtube! There is an added bonus of home workout routine in the DVD, though. So it's not money totally wasted. Having said that, the tips and instructions that Vic produced are some of the most educational that I've seen. They're easy to understand and not injury-inducing. I've been following his routines for a few weeks now, and I'm getting that good burn afterward consistently. Thanks Vic!",1303257600,6,631,4.745454545454545
8259880,5,B0015TT2YK,I love the way he explains the exercises.  He puts it in a way that is simple and easy to understand.  The exercises are easy to do.
