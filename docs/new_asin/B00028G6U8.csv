2068217,3,B00028G6U8,"1. Kane vs. benoit- should be a horrible title match Kane cannot wrestle and Benoit wrestles too good. Benoit will carry this match but I hope Kane gets the win.
2. Hell in a cell HHH vs. HBk-Ok i cant say. WWE might make this the match of the year.. or they could make it very sad like the Nash vs. HHH. For match I think HHH wins ( it hurts me to say that) it might be the last match we see HBk in ever( that hurts me even more).
3. Benjamen vs. Orton- This will be the match of best quiality of the night. But they never should have had these two fight on raw. Orton picks up the win.
4. Gail Kim vs. Victoria - don't really care this should be a DUD i think Gail gets a well deserving win.
More matches will be made on raw. so far it could be great or horrible.... who knows?

2068219,4,B00028G6U8,"This was a PPV back when WWE was still riding the wave of WrestleMania XX with Chris Benoit as champion and the Triple H/HBK fued as the top fued on RAW.  RAW was really on a roll & superior to their SmackDown counterparts at this time.

1. World Tag Team Championship Match: La Resistance (c) vs. Chris Benoit & Edge - This was the rematch from two weeks earlier on RAW and was actually a decent opener as La Resistance were the best tag team at this time & weren't reduced to glorified jobbers.  In the end, this match was just here to get more heat on Benoit's World Title match later in the night but this is still a good opener.

2. Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko - Jericho carried Tomko to his best match in his whole WWE career as he made Tomko actually decent here.

3. Intercontinental Championship Match: Randy Orton (c) vs. Shelton Benjamin - This was back when Shelton Benjamin was just switched to RAW on a roll from beating Triple H & everyone else in Evolution while Orton was still in his prime as the Intercontinental Champion.  Both men's inring work was top notch and eventhough it gets slow at time, it's still a great match that you probably wouldn't see today from these two.

4. Fatal Four Way Match for the Women's Championship: Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus - This was just a big cluster for the most part as there really wasn't a time where each woman was allowed to outshine the other.  Trish wins the title back here but this is one of the last matches featuring the ""women who can wrestle"" mentality that WWE had at the time went out the window.

5. Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman - This was back when the crowd actually cared about Eugene and Coach was put here to make this match somewhat comedic but it's just bad.

6. World Heavyweight Championship: Chris Benoit (c) vs. Kane - This was without a doubt one of Kane's best matches in his career while one of Benoit's best title defences.  They meshed well together here & put on a better performance than anyone could or should expect.  Plus it told a good inring story of how Benoit just could not get the crossface on Kane no matter how many times he tried.  I wish they would go on to fued more after this match but it just wasn't ment to be.

7. Hell in a Cell Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - These two go over 45 minutes to give everyone a classic Hell In The Cell match that doesn't depend on someone going outside the cell, falling off the cage, or beating each other down with weapons the whole time to make it memorable.  This was just those two beating each other down so badly that even you as the viewer is exausted at the end of it and would surely end up in any best of Triple H or HBK DVD set.

In the end, this was one of the best offerings from WWE around this time period & I highly recommend for anyone just based off the main events alone.",1175644800,,2862,4.262476894639557
2068220,3,B00028G6U8,"1. World Tag Team Championship Match: La Resistance (c) vs. Chris Benoit & Edge
Decent I suppose, but very predictable ending. And Benoit in two matches at this ppv? Talk about a shortage of guys on the roster. Average opener. 5.5/10

2. Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko
Definitely Tomko's best match in the WWE. Jericho makes him look halfway decent in this match, which is a miracle. Jericho puts on a good performance, and makes this one pretty decent. Worth a watch. 6.5/10

3. Intercontinental Championship Match: Randy Orton (c) vs. Shelton Benjamin
My oh my I forgot how annoying Evolution was until I saw this match again. This is a good midcard match, theres a couple nice spots and has a generally good pace, though slow at times. I like Orton's in ring work, and Shelton is always fun to watch. Together they put on a good match for the Intercontinental title, though Flair's interference gets old quickly. 7.5/10

4. Fatal Four Way Match for the Women's Championship: Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus
Not a bad women's match I suppose, but I really don't care for the women's division. Skip this, pretty much a waste, considering theres other matches on this card much more worthy of your time. 4/10

5. Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman
Theres only one word to describe this: Ugh. Don't even bother with this match. The mere sight of Eugene in the ring is enough to make me sick, and Coach isn't much to brag about either. I have no idea why the WWE thought this would work. No matter what anybody says, Eugene is not in the least bit entertaining, he is just an incredible waste of space on the card that makes the company look bad by even performing in the arena. This match is enough to make a person violently ill. 0/10

6. World Heavyweight Championship: Chris Benoit (c) vs. Kane
I didn't really care for Benoit as a champion, but he gave us great title defenses. He certainly proved to the fans that he deserved to have the title around his waist. I didn't really expect much from this match, but it certainly delivers. I was really glad to see Kane in the title picture, because they don't give him the title push often. When they do however, it works. I'm not sure why they haven't pushed him more often, because its not like he can't carry himself in a match. This is no exception. These two make this very back and forth and exciting. Great title bout, good performances by both men. 8.5/10

7. Hell in a Cell Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
This match is truly a masterpiece. Probably one of the most brutal matches the WWE has ever given us, and on top of that, its an excellent match. This is personally my favorite fued of all time, and I can't think of a more fitting ending for it. These two beat each other so badly, and just when you think its going to end, it keeps going. Probably the second best Hell in a Cell match of all time, only behind the original. Also the second best match of the year, behind the Triple Threat at Wrestlemania XX. Great use of weapons, they use a ton. And for a 47 minute match, the pace is excellent. By the end of this bloody war, these two men are exausted, and I can't think of a better way to end the night or the fued between these two. Amazing match, one of my favorites. 9.5/10

Overall, this is a decent Pay Per View. It has its moments, and even a couple suprising ones. What really makes this one worth watching and owning is the WHC match and the main event.

Match of the Night: Hell in a Cell: HHH vs. HBK. This is by far the match of the night, and as previously mentioned, the second best match of the year. These two stole the show, this match is amazing. Any fan of HHH, HBK, or wrestling in general needs to see this.",1148688000,2,3709,4.380813953488372

Match One-World Tag Team Championship-La Resistance(C)Vs Chris Benoit & Edge-This is the rematch from a few weeks ago in Montreal. Edge speared Benoit that time accidentally and it cost them the titles, will they win their rematch or will La Resistance find a way to retain? I believe this was a great choice as the opener and it had to be with Benoit doing double duties that night. It had a nice length with some great action. Edge nearly speared Benoit again but this time he stopped. The ending was absolutely terrible and it ruined this match a lot and it made me mark it down a little because of that. Still a good solid opener though. My rating 6.80/10.

Match Two-Y2J Vs Tyson Tomko-This was Christians problem solver and after their grueling cage match where Christian injured his back a few weeks ago. Tyson had been attacking Y2J anytime and anywhere. The actual match wasn't the greatest cause Tyson is such a big man and is very new to the ring. Trish tried to interfere quite a bit and that was effective. It was quite a short match but it still did what it was meant to do. My rating 6.50/10.

Match Three-Intercontinental Championship-Randy Orton(C)Vs Shelton Benjamin-Will the longest reigning Intercontinental Champion be able to beat another challenger in Shelton Benjamin or will Shelton become the new champion? This match had a lot of interference by Ric""Nature Boy"" Flair. The match was awesome with lots of innovative moves and holds. The ending was good and described a lot of what it was about. My rating 7.7/10.

Match Four-Fatal Fourway-Womens Championship-Victoria(C)Vs Lita Vs Gail Kim Vs Trish Stratus-This was an average womens match with a good ending describing what the winner is like. I wish Victoria stayed as the evil heel not the dancing face. This wasn't great but it was a solid match. My rating 5.16/10.

Match Five-Eugene Vs Jonathan""Coach""Coachman-This was a really entertaining match with lots of Eugene's trademarks done. This match was the perfect length even though it was really short. It had a good ending and lots of funny moments. My rating 7.91/10.

Match Six-World Heavyweight Championship-Chris Benoit(C)Vs Kane-Kane was dominating Raw and won a battle Royal to get a shot at Benoit at Bad Blood. Will Kane become normal like he wants or will Benoit make him tap tap tap like he said and retain the big gold belt? This was a good match with a good length. There was lots of working each over with Kane dominating a lot. The ending was absolutely spectacular and it was well worked making it look great. My rating 8.52/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-Hell In The Cell-HHH Vs Shawn""HBK""Michaels-The battle to end all,the battle to determine who is the best wrestler out of the former DXers. Two men walk into hell, only one man walks out. HHH is undefeated in Hell In The Cell except for the six man at Armageddon 2000 but he didn't get pinned. Noone mentioned HBKs record of Hell In The Cell which is 1-0 as he was in the first Hell In The Cell against The Undertaker at Bad Blood 1997. This match was off the charts, it was 47 minutes long and it was non stop action with finishers and lots of weapons used. I absolutely love this match its well worth the price alone. My rating 9.79/10.

Bad Blood was a great show with no matches failing so lets see how it does on my rating chart. The score it received was 52.38/70 which is a good score. The score in a percentage is 74.82% which is a good rating. Finally with the percentage to obtain the grade this show receives a B+ which is a good solid show. This has some great matches but the main matches I believed were great were the HBK Vs HHH Hell In The Cell,Eugene Vs Coach & Kane Vs Benoit. I believe this DVD is a must have for anyone as it is really entertaining,thrilling and enjoyable",1119830400,,4409,4.691503267973856
2068234,4,B00028G6U8,"I won't deny it, the card itself wasn't the best there was. The tag team championship match had a horrible ending, and the Coach/Eugene match wasn't exactly the best match either of these two had, but the extras have some of the most intriguing storylines leading up to the ppv event itself....

World Tag Team Championship Match

Edge and Benoit vs. La Resistance [Champions]

I thought it was cool when Benoit and Edge were the tag champs. Of course this was before Edge went a little more mental than he already was and started rambling on about winning the world championship.

The match itself was a typical Raw match, some intensity by Benoit and some distractions by La Resistance to get the upperhand. However Kane came down to the ring and beat the crap out of Benoit, disqualifying La Resistance. 7/10

Eugene vs. The Coach:

Some funny moments by Eugene and the crowd was well into his corner. But then Coach called down some lady to distract Eugene and the whole match never regained speed. Coach's helper, Garrison Cade, tried to help Coach, but Eugene wins with the stunner. 7.5/10

Fatal Fourway for the Women's Championship

Lita vs. Trish Stratus vs. Victoria [Champion] vs. Gail Kim

I remember the days when the Women's Championship actually had some great competitors. It was actually a fast paced match, and all four women looked top notch.

I really wanted Lita to win, but Trish gets the pin literally out of nowhere and celebrates after becoming the only women in history to win the title 5 times. 7.5/10

Intercontinental Championship

Randy Orton [Champion] vs. Shelton Benjamin

Some ironic facts are that they cut out the scene where Randy slips on the ring ropes as he is doing his interview of how he has been champion for 7 months, and the longest reigning champ in 7 years. And the second fact is that now his opponent has held the championship almost as long, less than a year later

The match was fast paced, and Shelton really shined flying all over the ring. Ric Flair makes an apperance, which leads to the best moment of the match when Shelton is pinning Randy while he has Flair in the Figure Four. Randy wins with the roll of the tights. 8/10

Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko

How long has it been since Jericho has even been in a one on one match for the World Title? Nowadays he's lucky if he wins a match against a jobber. Not much to say as Tomko sucks, Jericho tries to bring out the best in the match, but it didn't live up.

Trish tries to interfere but gets knocked down by Tomko and then Jericho wins with an enzugiri 7/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Chris Benoit [Champion] vs. Kane

Benoit makes Kane pay for attacking him in this intense Title match. Kane stuck to big men power moves and Benoit came alive after a few minutes and used some wrestling moves to take him down.

Everyone wondered if Benoit could make Kane tap, but Benoit rolled him up for the win. 8/10 It wasn't until a few weeks later that Benoit did force him to tap out.

Hell in a Cell Match

Triple H vs. Shawn Michales

This was almost 50 minutes of bloody hard hitting action. This was the perfect setting for their final match in their feud, but some moments were a little slow. But then again they only occured about 40 minutes into the match so its reasonable why they were exhausted.

Highlights include some incredible hard hitting chops by Shawn on Triple H. Then Shawn climbs on a ladder and gives an elbow drop onto Hunter. The ending occurs when HHH gives Shawn 3 pedigrees. 8.5/10 Just for the sheer amount of time they were in that match.

As you can see, even the best matches are only good to see everyonce in a while. Its the extras that make up for it.

EXTRAS:

Not only do you have the promos for Kane/Benoit, and HHH/HBK, but you also have a 2 minute highlight segment of HHH in his hell in a cell matches. A real good peice of highlights for that one.

It also has highlights of HHH beating up HBK. They include his street fight matches with Shawn and his awsome two out of three falls match at Armageddon 2002.

The second part has HBK beating up HHH in the same highlights of the same matches.

There are more but its these 4 parts of the extras that make up for the DVD. I would definately reccomend this if you are making a collection.",1115078400,,4286,4.4774774774774775

CHRIS BENOIT & EDGE defeated LA RESISTANCE by Disqualification in a Match for the World Tag-Team Titles: Solid 10 minute opener. Both Grenier & Conway seem to be improving, and tag-team wrestling seems to mask their deficiencies well enough. Well paced with only one prolonged period involving a resthold. In the final 2-3 minutes, there was some genuinely good byplay between all 4 men. But then Kane came down to interfere causing the DQ. Disappointingly booked ending: (a) Grenier lasted longer than World Heavyweight Champions in the crossface, and (b) if Kane was to come down, why couldn't it result in a La Resistance win, so they could gloat about beating Benoit & Kane twice!?!?!? Match Rating...6

CHRIS JERICHO defeated TYSON TOMKO: I almost over-rated this match because of the fact that I was concentrating too much on whether or not Tomko made mistakes. There really isn't much to say about this bout. It was 6 minutes of decent big man vs smaller man action. Nothing special at all. Luckily Tomko did not embarrass himself & Jericho kept the pace up to an acceptable level. Match Rating...5

RANDY ORTON defeated SHELTON BENJAMIN to Retain the InterContinental Title: Firstly, I liked the idea of using an Orton promo to kick things off, as it added just that little more intensity that the feud needed. But my goodness, after the first couple of minutes of decent action, this bout took a long time to get going. There is just something about these 2 that doesn't click. There's just no 'wow' factor there. It really did need the appearance of Ric Flair and, of all things, an intense battle of swinging right hands to finally breathe some life into the match. While the final few minutes of the match were good, I did not like the booking of them. Benjamin dominated Orton. While Orton kicked out of numerous 2 counts, Shelton hardly found himself on his back. Yet, not only did Orton somehow get the win, but Benjamin really did nothing to super impress me. I'm possibly being a little harsh on 2 of the WWE's finest young superstars, but this feud better continue & improve, or else I will judge it as nothing more than average. Match Rating...6

TRISH STRATUS defeated LITA, GAIL KIM & VICTORIA in a Fatal Fourway Match to Win the WWE Women's Title: Ummm, I could swear that this match was supposed to be an Elimination Match. It would have been better as one. What we ended up with though was a fun match that was way too frenetically paced. The action was almost too hard to keep up with, if you can believe that with a women's match. Maybe the WWE thought some short-term harm for the long-term good of the division was what was needed. Don't get me wrong, this 5 minute match was entertaining, but it was pretty much just a series of spots. An elimination match with an extra 3 or 4 minutes would have come off better, in my opinion. The winner was almost unimportant. Match Rating...6

EUGENE defeated JONATHAN COACHMAN: This is the type of match that sometimes make me wish that I didn't do a PPV Rating column. I mean, how do you rate a match like this!?!?!? Basically, it was 7 minutes of letting Eugene be humorous/entertaining. Some of the spots that had been done before didn't have the same impact this time around, so the WWE need to be careful of repetitiveness when it comes to Eugene. But there were enough new spots here to have me chuckling. Even a very awkward Stone Cold Stunner!!! Very hard to rate, but definitely served it's purpose successfully. I suppose WWE does stand for World Wrestling Entertainment. Match Rating...6

CHRIS BENOIT defeated KANE to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: Excellent wrestling match which had a little bit of everything. Kane hasn't had a match as good as this in years, and it's quality is a testament to the ability of Benoit. I loved the intensity at the beginning of the bout, and while there was a little quiet patch afterwards, it was all for a reason. Kane worked on Benoit's neck, while the champ worked on the challenger's shoulder & leg. What followed was very good psychological wrestling with Kane simply trying to use brute strength to win the title, while Benoit used a clever variation of technical skill to wear down the much larger man. The final few minutes were very well booked & performed with Benoit doing everything to make Kane submit. When he continuously was unsuccessful, he went for the surprise rollup which could, and did, legitimately catch Kane off guard. Benoit deserves to be champion for many months to come. Match of the night. Match Rating...8

TRIPLE H defeated SHAWN MICHAELS in a Hell In A Cell Match: Oh boy, I just know opinions are going to be divided over this one. Unfortunately, if you were looking forward to which side of the fence I was going to jump to, you may be disappointed as I am going to sit right on it. It was a bruising match with very good intensity & excellent work ethic. I find it very hard to be critical when 2 men put in as much as these 2 did here. Furthermore, I thought they did the little things correctly & with that extra bit of oomph that was needed. I'm talking of the foreign object shots, landings, etc... However, at 47 minutes in length, I have to state that not enough really happened. I can't say that I was expecting anything 'Foley-like', but I was expecting something new & different. That definitely didn't come & the main story that was told here was how gruelling a match this was (which is arguably the main purpose of the cell). In fact, it almost went out of it's way to set up the (well-deserved) time off that these 2 should be getting soon. When rated in isolation, this was definitely above average, but maybe it's time for the cell to have a long rest (about 2 years), until someone can do it a little more justice. Match Rating...7

PPV RATING (44/70) = 63

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'Bad Blood' a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'worth a watch'. It seems that the Raw brand is at least consistent, with this ppv scoring exactly the same as Backlash 2 months ago. This ppv could be looked at as a solid event. It had no failing match & a very good World HeavyWeight Title bout. Conversely, it could be seen as an opportunity lost. Better booked endings to the tag-team & InterContinental title matches, along with a more spectacular main event, could easily have nudged this ppv up to a B+ grade. So while this event has received the highest rating of all single-brand ppv's ever (by 0.35%), it could so easily have been a lot better. Coulda, shoulda, woulda. At the end of the day, this event was a worth a watch.",1114732800,,7148,4.55962587685113

World Tag Team Championship

La Resistance vs Chris Benoit & Edge 7/10- a good match to kick things off. the frenchmen wrestle their best match to date. good old school tag match.

Tyson Tomko vs Chris Jericho 6/10- jericho carries this big stiff to a good match. he can make anyone look good.

Intercontinental Championship

Randy Orton vs Shelton Benjamin 7.5/10- orton comes out with the mic spewing words. orton shows similarity to The Rock with his mic skills. a good match between 2 future stars of WWE. these 2 get better each time they wrestle.

a must see segment backstage with Matt Hardy & Lita.

Women's Championship

Fatal Four Way

Victoria vs Trish Stratus vs Lita vs Gail Kim 5/10- pretty good match for the women but way too short for a 4 way.

Jonathan Coachman vs Eugene 8/10- gets a high rating based on the entertainment value. hilirious and worth seeing. no wrestling moves hardly at all.

World Heavyweight Championship

Chris Benoit vs Kane 7.5/10- this one has high and low points. Benoit was all ready tired from fighting but he manages to carry the big oaf to a good match. could have been better.

Hell In A Cell

Triple HHH vs Shawn Michaels 8/10- a good h.i.a.c. but not a great one. this one has slow moments in it. it is very intense with a great ending. the longest cell match ever at 47 minutes.",1111622400,2,1568,4.51063829787234
2068251,4,B00028G6U8,"1) La Resistence vs Chris Benoit, Edge. this was a  fast paced match and i really enjoyed it. it wasn't one of the best openers i have ever seen but it wasn't too bad. Kane interfered to cost Edge and Chris Benoit the tag titles. 6.5/10

2) Chris Jericho vs Tyson Tomko. Tomko is one of the worst wrestlers in the wwe but Jericho took tomko to a very good match. i enjoyed it. tomko accidentaly hitting Trish and then Jericho capitalizes with the running insegoure. 7/10

3) Randy Orton vs Shelton Benjamin. Shelton and Randy Orton are really good wrestlers and they definently proved it. this match was very fast paced and very entertaining. one of the best matches of the night. randy orton wins with a school boy. great match. 8/10

4) Eugene vs Jonothan Coachman. this match wasn't really a wrestling match. it was more of a funny entertaining match. it was funny and entertaining. how long are they planning on keeping this Eugene charactor going because it is getting very old. still this match was very funny. 7/10

5) 4 way for the womens title. Trish vs Victoria vs Gail Kim vs Lita. this was a pretty good womens match. it was very short. trish wins by getting the school boy on lita and becoming the 5 time womens champion. good match. 7/10

6) Kane vs Chris Benoit. this was the secong best match of the night. Kane is usually a bad wrestler but Chris Benoit made him look very good in the match. these to put on a terrific match wich ended up with chris benoit getting the pin on Kane. 9/10

7) Hell in a cell. Triple H vs Shawn Miceals. I need to say that i have seen a lot better Hell in a cell's than that. it was still good but doesnt compare to the Underatker vs Mick Foley hell in a cell and the Undertaker vs Shawn Miceals hell in a cell. the reason this was good was because of the time. they fought for a long 45 minutes. good match. 9.5/10

My favorite instalment of the Bad Blood series.

Opening Match:

1. World Tag Team Championship Match

Sylvan Grenier and Rob Conway (c)s vs Chris Benoit and Edge

Best of these two teams matches.  Ends with Kane attacking Benoit causing the disqualification allowing him and edge to win but not to win the tag titles. 6.5/10

2. Chris Jericho vs Tyson Tomko

Descent match for Tomko.  Jericho hits a Enziguri to get the 1-2-3.2.5/10

3. Intercontinental Championship Match

Randy Orton (c) vs Shelton Benjamin

Good match with an old school finish when Benjamin hits a Diving Cross Body Block and Orton rolls over, pulls the tights and retains the title. 6.5/10

4. Womens Championship fatal 4 Way Match

Victoria (c) vs Trish vs Gail Kim vs Lita

Trish wins. 4/10

5. Eugene vs The Coach

Very funny match with Eugene getting the pin after a Hogan Leg Drop. 6/10

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match

Chris Benoit (c) vs Kane

Great match from Kane.  Benoit rolls up Kane to retain his title.

I think this should have been the main event because the World Title is supposed to be the most important thing in Pro Wrestling. 7.5/10

7. Hell in a Cell Match

Triple H vs Shawn Michaels

Long ass HIAC Match.  These two are great friends and really know how to steal the show. This match goes over 45 minutes with Triple H scoring the pinfall after a massive Pedigree. 10/10",1110585600,,1414,4.669387755102041

La Resistance vs. Chris Benoit & Edge

Edge spent most of the time in the ring for obvious reasons but when Benoit is in there it's very good.  La Resistance didn't get any credit for their long title run which is a shame.  Solid match.

Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko

Only Y2J could've made this a good match.  Tomko wasn't terrible but when he isn't carried properly he's exposed as just another bland big man.

Intercontinental Championship

Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin

The future of the wwe right here!  What an excellent match.  These two have some awesome moves and worked really well together.  Even an appearance by Flair couldn't ruin this.

Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman

More for comic relief than anything else.  It is funny but shouldn't be on ppv.

Fatal Four-Way for the Women's Championship

Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita

Much better than the usual women's match.  Can't believe the outcome though.

World Heavyweight Championship

Chris Benoit vs. Kane

There was concern from fans about this for lack of feud heat but thankfully Benoit carried Kane to a very good match.  A few slow spots in the middle but it's still a breath of fresh air not having HHH in it.  A little factoid: This was the first Raw title match without Triple H since Summerslam 2002!! Yeah he IS married to the boss' daughter.

Hell in a Cell

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels

For all the bad things  HHH has done to Raw with politics he still manages to care enough about his matches.  This was the match of the year.  47 mins and it never gets slow anywhere in between.  Just a hard nosed match with two greats.  Basically the HIAC to end them all.  I don't think we'll see another one for a while.  Amazing match!",1105488000,4,1756,4.572815533980583

1. WTT Championship, La' resistance Vs. Edge & Chris Benoit.

Good Tag-Team match, Even though benoit didn't stay long in this match. The best spot would probably be Edge's Spear to Rob Conway or when Edge did a sick neckbreaker to both of those French fa**ots. 7/10.

Kane's best match since 2002! a easy 4-star matchup with a good ending when Benoit couldn't get the Crossface on Kane. Nice match but I thought Kane would win T_T. 8/10.

6. HIAC Match, HBK Vs. HHH.

Best HIAC match ever? Not really but probably the 2nd best before The first HIAC match. They used a ladder...the second time a Ladder was used in a Hell in a Cell match. ****, they used everything on eachother....This is what a good match is about, it took 3 pedigrees to takeout HBK, But we all know that HBK is the real winner. :D 10/10.",1102636800,,1505,4.492647058823529

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels is Shawn's and Hunter's greatest match together and it is probably the end of their rivalry.  I think it should continue until Shawn wins the title or until Shawn retires and HHH gets a win over Michaels at Bad Blood.

World Tag Team Titles- Benoit/Edge def. La Resistance  5/10

Everyone says this match was good but the fact is, it wasn't. La Resistance are boring to watch and they dominated this match. All this match had in it was puching and rest holds exept when Benoit got in which wasn't very often. Anyway Kane interferes and gives Benoit/Edge the win by disqualification but La Resistance retain the tag team belts at the 10 minute mark.

Chris Jericho def. Tyson Tomko 7.5/10

This was actually a great wrestling match. Y2J was brilliant as usual and Tomko can actually wrestle. I loved the moves used by both guys but the only thing I can complain about is the length of the match. Chris Jericho gets the wins at the 6 minute mark with the insuguree after Tomko knocked Trish off the apron by mistake.

Intercontinental Title-Randy Orton def. Shelton Benjamin 8/10

This match started by Orton coming out taunting the crowd and Shelton Benjamin came out and started this match early. These two wrestled a great, fast paced match up but it got a bit messy at times with Flair interfering. Benjamin went for a cross body off the top rope but Orton reversed it into a roll up to get the three count at the 15 minute mark.

Womans Title-Trish def. Victoria, Lita, Gail Kim 6/10

A good womans match but not as good as Victoria vs. Lita at Backlash. I thought Lita was going to win after that devastating DDT but Trish caught her by suprise getting the three count via roll up at the 5 minute mark.

Eugene def. Coach 7/10

Not really a wrestling match but still great entertainment and comedy. Eugene is a good wrestler but Im not sure about his character. Eugene picked up the win with the Rock bottom and peoples elbow at the 8 minute mark.

WHW Championship-Chris Benoit def. Kane 8.5/10

An exellent technical match up. Benoit tried the crossface and sharpshooter many times but couldn't get Kane locked in. Kane hit a chokeslam but Benoit kicked out! In the end Benoit faked Kane into the crossface and rolled him into a small package for the three at the 18 minute mark.

Triple H def. Shawn Michaels-Hell in a Cell 10/10

What a match!!! It is a contender for match of the year and is easily the best HIAC ever. Both men ended up bloody and battered and many weapons were used. HBK hit sweet chin music but HHH kicked out. Triple H finally got the win at the 47 minute mark with a third straight pedigree.

This was Benoit's first of two matches on the night.  This match was a rematch from RAW, in which La Resistance won the titles in a great match.  Good match here.  Sick spot when Edge turns a double suplex into a double DDT.  Kane makes an appearance.  (7.5/10)

2. Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko

This match was put on the card, to get Tomko some spotlight.  Very unimpressive effort on his behalf.  Jericho really carried Tomko, who struggled for any fluency.  (6/10)

3. Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin (Intercontinental Title)

Really good match.  I think it was about what people expected.  It started a little slow, but finished strong.  Great finish, marked with fast paced action and near falls.  Ric Flair makes an appearance.  (8.5/10)

I am far from a fan of women's wrestling, but this wasn't that bad.  Decent effort by the women.  (6/10)

Eugene's first match on a PPV.  Very comedic, but that is about it.  (7/10)

6. Chris Benoit vs. Kane (World Heavyweight Title)

Good match, but not as good as I think everyone else thought.  A lot of people werent' expecting much out of the match, but were presently surprised.  I was expecting a lot out of the mathc, but didn't get what I expected.  Still a decent match, though.  Good finish.  (7.5/10)

7. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H (Hell In A Cell)

Wow!  What a performanc by these two men.  They really showed their love and passion of wrestling.  They went at it hard in this 45 minute plus brawl.  That's right, it is over 45 minutes long from opening bell, to ending bell.  Everything is thrown in this match: chairs, tables, ladders, ring steps.  Amazing.  Very emotional match.  Great finish.  The end is slow (because the two had lost so much blood and were out of energy) but very exciting, with numerous amounts of near falls.  Great match.  I oringinally thought the main event from Wrestlemania 20 was the match of the year, but now I think it was this one.  Sick match. A great end to a great fued. (9.5/10)

I would pick up this DVD for the Hell In A Cell match alone.  It is worth the price just to see these two give it their all.

1. World Tag Team Championship Match

La Resistance (C) vs. Chris Benoit and Edge

-Decent opening match, the first of two title matches for Chris Benoit on the night. Really nothing more than a filler though. DQ finish when Kane interferes to soften up Benoit for the World Title match later on. 4/10

2. Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko

Really short match, nothing special either. Jericho carries Tomko to a respectable match. Just another example of how badly Jericho has been misused. Jericho wins with the running enzigury. 3/10

Randy Orton (C) vs. Shelton Benjamin

Really good match between two of the most promising young stars in WWE. Good back and forth action. Some good spots when Flair interferes. Orton wins with a handful of tights. 7/10

4. Fatal 4-Way Women's Championship Match

Victoria (C) vs. Trish Stratus vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita

Pretty good for a women's match, not the same old things we see on Raw every week from the divas. Trish steals the victory and the championship. 5/10

5. Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman

Nothing great. Some entertaining parts from the Coach. Eugene wins to continue his big push. 5/10

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match

Chris Benoit (C) vs. Kane

Another great title match featuring Benoit. Kane also shows his ability to mix it up with one of the more technical wrestlers in WWE. Benoit wins with a cradle. 7/10

7. Hell in a Cell Match

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels

Good start to the match, but it dragged on for too long and had way too many rest spots. Expected this one to be off the charts, but it never really got very intense. Still, a good Hell in a Cell match but nowhere near as good as Taker vs. Brock or Triple H vs. Foley. 7/10

The Matches:

Match 1: World Tag Team Championship Match

La Resistance vs. Chris Benoit & Edge  8/10

I cant believe they made this match a set-up for the World Title Match! I really think there were other Raw superstars that could have wrestled instead of Benoit because he has another match!

Match 2: Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko  6/10

Not a great match but good for the PPV debut of Tomko. Again, I don't think Jericho should be wrestling a newbie like Tomko. He should at least be wrestling someone like Orton for the IC Title.

Match 3:Intercontinental Title Match

Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin  9/10

A great match but i think Benjamin should be in the World title match and Orton should fight Jericho. But awesome none the less.

Match 4: Womens Championship Match

Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus  6/10

A great womens match. Trish becomes the first ever 5 time Womans champ. Raw finally used more than 2 women for the title.

Match 5: Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman  7/10

It was basically filler but Eugene makes his WWE PPV debut and I liked the post-match celibration.

Match 6: World Heavyweight Championship Match:

Chris Benoit vs. Kane  9/10

Wow! What a match! I think that kane deserves a nother title reign that lasts longer that 1 day! But this was a great match filled with tecnical wrestling and finally HHH wasn't in a World Title Match!

Main Event: HELL IN A CELL

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels  10/10

This was possibly the best Hell in a Cell ever. I don't understand how anyone can not like this match! It was one of HBK's best and easilly their best one-on-one match vs. eachother. There was a bit of everything. Tables, ladders and chairs,... and this was a 47 minute match!! this was like a TLC, Ironman, Hell in a Cell. The only bad this in this match was that they didn't leave the cell and it wasn't utilised enough to be a total brawl. But as I said, you will eather love this match or you will hate it!

Match of the Night: Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels

Final Comments: This was easily raws best PPV of the year (as of september). Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin was great and was closely consitterd for match of the night. Benoit vs. Kane was also consittered but HHH vs. HBK was the Show Stopper.

2068277,3,B00028G6U8,"At Bad Blood 2003, Triple H clashed with Kevin Nash in one of the sloppiest Hell in a Cell matches, and Ric Flair and the HBK wrestled in what was going to be a match to remember... but it didn't.

This year, I an improvement over last year. Triple H was on fire going into 2004, Chris Benoit had finally proved his critics wrong, and the ex-WCW wrestlers who endud up feuding with The Game had either left the WWE, or moved to Smackdown! (Booker T fits that category).

Though this PPV is much better than last year's, it still doesn't deliver what RAW had to offer. Benoit did wrestle twice, and that is a good thing to lighten up this PPV, but the first match is ruined by Kane interfering in the World Tag Team title match. The match is rather forgettable, but Benoit gets the second match against Kane for the World Heavyweight Championship.

Kane vs. Chris is one of the most bland title matches in a while. Benoit does not deserve a defence against a boring wrestler, and Kane doesn't deserve a title shot, nor a title at all. Kane is supposedly the most sadistic guy in the business, but is more the slowest guy. A 7 foot guy who pants like a dog after every high offense is not my idea of a great match.

We get to see a great Intercontinental Title match between Randy Orton, the longest reigning champ in 7 years (and now World Heavyweight Champ) vs. Shelton Benjamin (where'd he go anyway?). This is probably the best technical match of the night... well, just the best technical match of the night. I won't say anything that happens in it, but I gotta tell ya- the match alone is not worth a purchase of a DVD. But it is great. I'll sum it up later for ya.

Next, Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko. Christian had been injured in a cage match between him and Jericho, and Tyson Tomko was Christian and Trish's lackey who looked more like a bouncer for some billion doller nightclub. Anyway, this match is rather forgettable, with Jericho taking the win with a sloppy-looking running enziguiri. Jericho is an amazing competitor, but Jericho couldn't carry this 285 pounder to a great match. At least a day or two from typing this Unforgiven will commence, with Jericho getting revenge on Christian in a definite fantastic ladder match! Whoo!

There are other matches that don't really matter, but here's the main event- no titles, no DQ, the end of a great rivalry- HHH vs. Shawn Michaels- Hell in a Cell. This 47 minute match is worth a view, indeed. But even with such a great match, is it worth a purchase? Is the match the greatest HIAC match of all time? My answer to that question- Hell NO! For some classic HIAC moments, watch Michaels vs. Taker, Taker vs. Foley, Foley vs. Triple H and the 6-man HIAC. Some other good ones were Jericho vs. Trips and Brock vs. Taker.

Quite frankly, this year's HIAC doesn't offer anything you haven't seen, apart from the longest HIAC in history.

All in all, try before you buy, because the PPV overall is dodgy in places, but then again, it is RAW only, so you might wanna save up your clams for the Ric Flair collection, Shawn Michaels: From the Vault and Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story, because they'll provide you with classic matches that'll last forever, rather than some forgettable, yet good, RAW PPV.",1094774400,,3258,4.500846023688664
2068288,3,B00028G6U8,"This pay-per-view was good, but nothing special. Here is a list of the matches from the event, each with a star rating.

La Resistance vs. Chris Benoit and Edge - why did this match happen? I easily predicted that Kane would come out and attack Benoit, and quite frankly, that's the only purpose for this match, to add fire to the Kane-Benoit match later in the show. *3/4

Tyson Tomco vs. Chris Jericho - Except for a few cool moves, this match was a dud. *3/4

Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin - good match, but not great. Could've been a lot better if it wasn't for Ric Flair's constant interference. Of course, the cowardly heel (Orton) wins the match by cheating. Some really nice moves & counters by both men, but nothing you haven't seen before. ***

Victoria vs. Trish Stratus v.s Lita v.s Gail Kim - boring. *

Eugene vs. The Coach - Why, Vince, why? Nobody wants to see Jonathan Coachman in the ring. People are paying their hard-earned money to watch wrestling, not a stupid circus act. This is not really a wrestling match, it's a spoof. It made me a laugh a few times, as Eugene embarrases The Coach over & over again. Still, the stuff has no business being on a live PPV event. I'm not even going to give this so-called match a star rating. It was all a big joke.

Chris Benoit vs. Kane - Chris Benoit actually carries Kane to a good match. Not a brawl or anything, just two guys battling for the WWE World Heavyweight Title. ***

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels - if you're expecting a bloodbath filled with shocking violence and out-of-control mayhem, then you'll probably be disappointed. This was the longest Hell In a Cell match in WWE history; 47 minutes & 26 seconds long! It was a good match, well-fought, great psychology, and very grueling. But if you've seen any of their past matches, then you've pretty much seen this one. Watch this, then compare it to their non-sanctioned match at WWE Summerslam 2002 and the Last Man Standing match from the 2004 Royal Rumble. You'll realize that they pretty much look the same. Both HBK & HHH put on a heck of a match, but it didn't quite live up to it's hype. It dragged on a quite a bit, and the bumps are far & between. Hardcore wrestling fans will be disappointed with the lack of blood and weapons. No barbed-wire. No thumbtacks. No sledgehammer. Just chairs, a table, a ladder, the ring steps, and of course, the cage itself. Sure, both men use a hidden blade and get ""busted open"", but who cares. Like we've never seen it before. Nothing special happened in this match. It won't make you yell at the screen too much. Still a good effort though. ***3/4",1094428800,,2619,4.46652719665272
2068289,5,B00028G6U8,"World Tag Team Championship Match

La Resistance vs. Chris Benoit & Edge 6/10

I don't know why I had this wierd thought that Benoit and Edge would going to win the match. Very good opening match until Kane came down and started to wipe the floor with Edge and his opponent for World title match, Chris Benoit.

Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko 6.5/10

Tomko looked a little slow and nervous but a little wierd to hear him have Christian's theme. One of Jericho's better matches since his face turn earlier in the year. Hoping Y2J could get some gold by the end of the year.

IC Match

Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin 10/10

One of the best matches of the night. Orton cuts a great promo before the match. Grows threw the crowd to find himself next to a attractive blonde woman sitting in the front row. I was dying laughing at the end of the promo when he slipped as he was climbing to the second rope. Benjamin has a great future as a singles wrestlers. Amazingly, he pins Orton while he has Flair in the figure-four leglock. Another win for the Legend Killer.

Fatal Four-way for Women's Title

Lita vs Trish Stratus vs Gail Kim vs Victoria 2/10

Wasn't too interested in this match. I hope that doesnt sound wierd.

Eugene vs. The Coach 5/10

Like everyone, I was expecting a dud. But it was a pretty good match. Eugene really likes to use other peoples finishers. LOL.

World Heavyweight Title

Chris Benoit vs. Kane 10/10

Really intense match. I thought Kane was going to pull a upset. Almost makes Kane tap but instead rolls him up. I personally would had like to seen him tap, even though he would later tap in a rematch on RAW. I never saw Kane recieve so many German Suplexs. One of Benoits best title defenses. Its great to see him defend the title with a different opponent.

Hell in a Cell

Triple H vs. HBK 9/10

It was one of those matches that was billed to be one of the best in WWE history but I personally think it was the most overrated match in recent memory. You might want to have a few bags of popcorn and drinks because this is a LONG hiac match. Hard to keep with it during certain parts of it. Loved the spots of HBK'S evil laugh when he grabs the ladder. I'm not dissing the match at all. Its one of my personal favorites but it shouldn't be billed as one of the best matches in history. It will probably be the best Hell in a Cell match, I think the first with HBK/UT was the best even overshadowing the Foley/UT at KOTR in 98. Highly recommend but you'd have to pay attention because it does get hard to watch as a while, not because its bloody but because its long.",1093132800,2,2595,4.293634496919918

2068301,4,B00028G6U8,"First of all i have heard people on this site putting down the main event but they are all wrong. It was an awsome main event because of 2 great ledgends courage. Here is my Review.

Benoit/Edge vs. La Resistance-This match is over rated. Sure it was the right length but it was full of punching and chokes and there was only a few wrestling moves used. I am glad Kane came out and stopped the time wasting on this ppv. La Resistance are in ring borers and Benoit and Edge are not tag team wrestlers. Not a good opener to Bad Blood. **

Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko-This was an entertaining match but was too short. If these 2 kept the pace up for another 5 minutes it would have been awsome. Otherwise a great match and should have been the opener. Y2J is the king and Tomko is a great rising talent and needs to be pushed more. ***

Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin-Expected alot better from this match and it should have been higher on the card. This match was sloppy and confusing all the through the 15 minutes. Why did Benjamin beat up Flair when he is in a match with Orton. The wrestling was still good but it didn't seem planned well enough to me. But still 3rd best match of the night. ****

Trish Stratus vs. Victoria vs. Lita vs. Gail Kim-Once again another short, Worthless womans match. If woman were given 10 minutes it could be decent but no. At least Trish won the title even though Vicoria is the most talented I was sick of her being the champion. Backlashes match was better. **

Eugene vs. Coach-Wasnt really a wrestling match but it was entertaining. Coach is actually a great athlete but can't wrestle and Eugene is a talent but is wasted being a walking idiot. A lady came out with cookies too distract Eugene but Eugene wins with a rock bottom and a peoples elbow. ***

Chris Benoit vs. Kane-I thought this would be a bad match but it turned out prety good. Seeing if Benoit could lock in those deadly submissions was entertaining and Kane worked a great match. All Kane needs to work on is long matches so he can get often title shots. Benoit retains after faking a crossface and getting a roll up pin. It was to predictable that Chris Benoit was going to win though. *****

HIAC-Triple H vs. HBK-Two great superstars plus a HIAC structure equals a great match. The only dissapointing thing was that they didn't escape the cell. Oh well still the best main event of the year so far and some close falls when I thought it was over. 47 minutes and it never got boring. This match had some great moves and was unpredictable what was going to happen. Triple H wins it after 3 straight pedigrees to Shawn Michaels. Exellent finish to the ppv. *****

Overall 3 great matches made a good ppv and it is worth buying.",1090627200,2,2735,4.3700787401574805
2068302,5,B00028G6U8,"Well let me start buy stateing that i attended this WWE EVent Live in Ohio With My 2 Best Friends. The PPV all together was not that great. infact of all the PPV's iv'e been to this one may have been the worst. HOWEVER The main event Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels In The ""Hell In A Cell"" May have very well been the best match i have seen. EVER. i'll try to keep this one short seeing as many of my reviews give way to much info on the DVD's or CD's im reviewing. If your a wrestling fan who is expecting 3+ hours of entertainment then don;t bother. if your a fan looking for one of the greatest WWE Matches of all time then i do recomend this dvd as it would be a very very verye nessecary part of any collection. however if your looking for an amazing bump match like all of Mick colefys HIAC Matches thne once again don't bother. this Match (HBK VS. HHH) is on a differnet level then those types of hell in a cell matches. were as mick foley relied on mind boggeling falls and bumps to make his matchs HBK And the game rely on talent and endurence to make theirs. the main event is just over 45 minutes makeing it the longest Hell In A Cell EVER. And i say that in a good way.it dosent loose momentum.if your a fan of Hunter Hearst Helmsley or Shawn Michaels then this is also a must have. i my self have 2 DVD copies and 1 VHS copy. it is one of my top 5 favorite matches of all time in the world of wrestling. for those who came here to here about something other then former DX Members dukeing it out heres how the rest of the card went down.

 Benoit and Edge Vs. La Resistance.

 Good match. would have been better if Kane Hadent Interfeared.

 Jericho Vs Tyson Tomko.

 Tomko makes his PPV Debut. Why i don;t know. decent match.

 Jericho Carried it. but it was tomko's first televised match so i guess he'll get better. if not we always have Batista :-$

 Randy Orton Vs Shelton Benjamin.

 Great Match. much like the main event it didn't get boring even thow it was rather long for a mid card match. great addition to the card and the 2nd best match of the night.

 Victoria vs. lita vs. trish vs. gail kim.

 average womens match. victoria seems to be carrining the womens division and this match only proves my point furthur that she has REAL talent. not like trish and lita who think fliping upside down a few times and being good at gymnnastics is what makes u a good wrestler. victoria does Great moves. many which have never been seen before in this country. (not in this match thow)

 Chris Benoit Vs Kane.

 seems like a standard WWE Title match here. Kane And Benoit are 2 of my favorite all time wrestlers. however they just don't seem to have that chemistry that you need to pull off a show stoping match. average match. nothing you haven't seen before.

 Eugene ""Nick"" Dinsmore Vs. The Coach.

 Supriseingly this match was amazing. well amazing for 2 guys with not a whole lot of PPV's on there list. the couch does a good job of wrestling for a guy whos an announcer. and eugene does some very... interesting moves in this one. without a doubt one of the most memerable matches ive seen in a long time. you have to see it to see what i mean.

 well thats about it. theres more good points to it then bad even thow i didn't make it look that way. thanks again for reading. peace.",1090627200,,3300,4.195238095238095

and finaly Orton ,at first sight i tought this man was bad but he's really BAD and disrepectful ,he reminds me of HBK at the beginning of his career as the sexy boy in 92 ,he performed poor matchs but made everytime an impact ,this man could be the future of wrestling

2068305,3,B00028G6U8,"I MUST warn all of you that Shawn Michales, for all of his great talent, does NOT pull off a reasonably good match at this PPV
The Hell in a Cell match is a 48-minute snore-fest filled with stalling, niether man really makes an impact on the other, there is far too much time spent with Triple H and Shawn selling the injuries they recieve in the match, and Hunter uses the Pedigree THREE times whilst Michales uses Sweet Chin Music twice...this is spread over twenty minutes of exactly the same forumula of brawling and stalling for injuries.
An overated bore that is oversahdwed by only TWO good matches on this ENTIRE card
Chris Benoit and Kane fight in what became a techincal MASTERPIECE for the World Heavyweight Championship.
This is Kane as you've never seen him before, as he tries to shake off Benoit's crippler crossface, he also WRESTLES rather than tries to squash his opponent with a chokeslam or a fierce kick, Benoit tries everything he can to defeat Kane, but with the crossface seemingly having no effect, Benoit resorts to a suprise manuvere to pin the ""Big Red Machine""
Eugene vs Coach is just stupid, some might call Eugene a ""Savant"", but to true wrestling fans, he's an excellent wrestler with a crappy and overated gimmick that has become so stale it's not funny.
Benoit and Edge's tag team title match against La Resistance begins wonderfully before interfearence from Kane ends the match before it could become any better.
Randy Orton and Shelton Benjamen also save this PPV with an inspiring, ground-based NWA-stlye match for the Intercontinental Championship.
Bad Blood is sadly only worth buying for these two good matches (Benoit vs Kane and Orton vs Benjamen), and the main event is horrible, better to save your cash for a far worthier WWE PPV",1089763200,,1775,4.785016286644951

Probably half time they spend laying on the ring. Why couldn't they make it Kane vs. Benoit in HIAC? Well if you're buying this just because of HIAC , i wouldnt recomend it.

This match was good and it was a good choice for an opener. The only bad part was when Kane came out, giving La Resistance the win. (9/10 Stars)
Match 2: Chris Jericho def. Tyson Tomko by pinfall.
An okay match. even though Jericho had bruised ribs, and Trish by the ring, he was still able to pull off a victory with a running enziguri. (8/10 Stars)
Match 3: Intercontinental Championship
Randy Orton(c) def. Shelton Benjamin by pinfall.
Awesome match. Both men put on a great fight. Randy Orton came out on top after Shelton Benjamin went to the top rope and came off with a cross body but Randy rolled through and hooked the tights to pin Shelton Benjamin for the three count to retain the title. (10/10 Stars)
Match 4: Fatal 4-Way Match- Women's Championship
Trish Stratus def. Victoria(c), Lita, and Gail Kim after pinning Lita.
There are so many awesome women's wrestlers on Raw. This match was great. Trish got the roll-up on Lita out of nowhere to become a 5-time women's champion. (9/10 Stars)
Match 5: Eugene def. Jonathan Coachman by pinfall.
Eugene is so funny. He made this match so good, and he whooped the Coach's little candy ass. He even did the Rock Bottom and People's Elbow! (10/10 Stars)

2068326,5,B00028G6U8,"With recent terrible ppv outings like Judgment Day this is what the WWE needed. I was at this show and loved it.
Edge and Benoit vs. La Resistance : Short Opener. Ends in interference.
Tyson Tomko w/Trish vs. Jericho : Alright Debut match for Tomko. Short and sweet. No major spots or anything special. Just good wrestling.
Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton: Great match. Orton entered from the audience and walked right by me. I was the guy in the Tie dyed shirt trying to take a picture. Flair interferes but Shelton gets him in the figure four. The two really put on a show. The crowd was totally into it. I liked the ending.
Trish w/ Tyson Tomko vs. Lita vs. Gail Kim vs. Victoria : Some good wrestling by the women. Tomko is immediately barred from ringside. Gail Kim does this awesome submission move. Lita hits a killer ddt. Not a bad match at all and it's kept short and sweet. Everyone knew who was going to win this one.
Eugene vs. Coach : Another great match. Much better than anyone expected. Eugene plays around with Coach and dominates him. Coach tries to trick Eugene with cookies. Garrison Cade interferes. Eugenes immitates his favorite wrestlers hitting the Rock Bottom, the Stunner, and also doing his Airplane spin. Not incredible but still better than people expected. The guy playing Eugene, Nick Dinsmore, is an incredible wrestler. He dominated in OVW for years and was their champ 8 times.
Kane vs. Benoit for the World Heavyweight Title: Another match that was much better than anyone expected. Kane dominates early and then Benoit starts to chop him down to size. First he takes out the legs and then moves on looking for the crossface. Some good back and forth with Kane doing some different moves that aren't in his normal routine match. Any Benoit match is gonna be great of course. No one interferes. The two just wrestle. Solid title match right here.
HHH vs. HBK Hell in a Cell: This match had everything. Starts with some good wrestling. Doesn't take long for chairs, metal stairs, the ladder, the cage, and tables to all come into use. Both guys end up getting really bloody and this match goes almost an hour. These two guys can really put on a match. U'll also get to see HBK go off the ladder doing an elbow drop on HHH through the table.
Buy This dvd just for the Hell in a Cell match. People wanted them to climb up top, and sadly this one stayed in the cage, but with HHH and HBK, it didn't matter at all. Probably the best WWE match of 2004 so far.",1087171200,,2489,4.496688741721854

Triple H vs Shawn Micheals 10/10
This match was awsome for many reasons some ppl might be dissapointed with the few high spots but boy did they slug it out. It was an all out brawl which included steel chairs steel steps. I was impressed with the match time maybe they arnt the same wrestlers they were years gone by but they made the match last and entertained the crowd another thing i noticed was the crowd were 60/40 micheals maybe the WWE could have Triple H turn babyface even though he is the best heel in the business today.

2068329,4,B00028G6U8,"Here is the review of Bad Blood 2004!
La Resistance v.s Chris Benoit and Edge (world tag team titles)
8/10
Good opening match. Edge spends more time in the ring because Benoit had to wrestle 2 matches in the one night. Match ends in D-Q after Kane assaults both Edge and Benoit.
Tyson Tomco v.s Chris Jericho
8/10
This was good for Tomco's first match ever. Jericho is being misused and should be main eventing however. Jericho wins after a running enziguri.
Randy Orton v.s Shelton Benjamin (Intercontinental title)
8/10
Was a good match, but should have been great. Both men tried hard though and did deliver a solid match in the end. Orton wins after rolling up Shelton and grabbing the tights.
Victoria v.s Trish Stratus v.s Lita v.s Gail Kim
7/10
This was good for a women's match. I never expected in a million years that Trish would win. I thought that Gail was a shoe-in, but Trish pulls it off.
Eugene v.s The Coach
8/10
Was expecting a dud match, but was very surprised. These 2 pull off a great match. Coach can actually wrestle! Eugene wins with the rock bottom and the peoples elbow.
Chris Benoit v.s Kane (world heavyweight title)
9/10
Best match on the card so far! This one was a lot better than I expected it to be. The highlight package at the start of this match is fantastic! The theme music is great and goes well with this match. Benoit can't get the win with the crossface, but he can get the win with a roll up! Best match of the night until.........
Triple H v.s Shawn Michaels (hell in a cell)
10/10
Everyone new that this would be the match of the night, and it was. The only bad thing was that they didn't fight out of the cell. The best spot was when Shawn Michaels climbed up the ladder, with his head touching the roof, and elbowed HHH through a table. I wish HBK would have won, but of course HHH wins again.
This match went an astonishing 47 minutes and 26 seconds!
So Bad Blood was a good event without a bad match on the whole card. When this comes out on DVD, but it straight away.",1087171200,3,2017,4.338624338624339

2068331,4,B00028G6U8,"I watched this on ppv and it was a great ppv and was highlighted by the hell in a cell match which went for 47 minutes.
La Resistance vs Benoit/Edge-Okay opener but it seemed alot like their RAW match and wasn't nothing special. Kane interferes and stops the match by beating up Benoit and Edge with chokeslams and smashes Benoit into the steel steps. La Resistance retain theit titles. 6/10 10 mins
Chris Jericho vs Tyson Tomco-Better match than I expected. Tomco is a real talent and should have a good future in the WWE but he was no match for the king of the world-Y2J. This match was only 6 minutes long but had fast action and good moves and it was entertaining watching Trish. Score reduced because of time not long enough 6/10 6 mins
Randy Orton vs Shelton Benjamin-Pretty good intercontinental title match but why was it this early it should have been just before the whwt match and the Hell in a cell. Solid match but was wasteful and got messy at times. The end was very sloppy with Orton winning by pulling Benjamins tights and Ric Flair interfering. The match was still better than their one on RAW. Two young talents puting on a great show. 8/10 15 mins
Victoria vs Trish vs Gail Kim vs Lita-Had a great start but as usual for a woman's match should be longer. Why don't they make woman's title matches 10 minutes instead of 4 or 5. All 4 of these woman are talented and this match had good action until it finished. I can't believe Trish is the Champion. YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 6/10
Eugene vs The Coach- I thought this match would be 2 minutes long and a waste of time but it turned into a decent show. This was not really a wrestling match but it was funny watching Eugene do his moves and act like an idiot. Eugene wins after Cade rips up his teddy and coach stuffs up the sneak attack. Eugene imitated the Rock with a rock bottom and a peoples elbow to pick up the win. P.S-I think the woman with the cookies won that Diva contest and is the new wwe woman superstar. 8/10 8 min
Benoit vs Kane-Decent title match. Every one on Amazon said this would be bad but it was pretty good. Kane dominated the whole match and I didn't know how they could make Benoit win because Kane could counter every move. The crossface,the sharpshooter and a headbutt off the top rope didn't put Kane down but a sneak roll up did. Benoit retains the title in a good match. 9/10 18 mins
HBK vs Triple H-A bloody affair between 2 great rivals/More blood than a good vampire movie. 47 minutes of scintillating action and was easily the best match of the year.  chairs,ladders and tables were all used to inflict damage on each combatant. Shawn Michaels back was destroyed early and there was plenty of action with weapons. My favourite part was when HBK jumped off the top of the ladder and smashed Triple H through the table with an elbow to the chest. The only dissapointing thing was they didn't escape the cell and go on top of it. Best match I have ever witnessed, a perfect score 10/10 47 mins

This PPV did Infaticly deserve the name it gets. BAD BLOOD!

Reviews go from 1(Worst) to 10(Fantastic!)
Matches are in Order....I think..
World Tag team championship
Chris Beniot,Edge Vs La resistance.....7/10
This match was good.  Good opener for the event.  I would have given it an 8 If it wasn't for Kanes Impact at the end of this match.
Jerico vs Mike Tomako(I can't say it right!)
This was a pretty good match....Great styles and moves From Y2J..8/10
Intercontenintal championship Match
Randy Ortan vs Shalten Benjimen....7/10
This match was kinda slow....But picks up very quick at the end...To bad Ortan had to hold the tights to win.....
Fatal 4 way for the Womens Title
Victoria vs Lita vs Trish Vs Gail Kim...4/10
I'm not really interested in these matches..But it was ok I guess....I wasn't to big on this one....Four just for lita...She mostly did all the Work....
Coach Vs Eugene....7/10
This was a pretty interesting match!  I really liked the way Eugene uses his talent...Yeah it's a gimmick but It's a good one....Go Eugene!!!!
World Heavyweight ChampionShip Match
Kane Vs Chris Beniot.....8/10
Very slow in the begining but in the end it picks up very well...Chris Beniot proves once again why he is 4-REAL!
Hell in a Cell Match
Triple H Vs Shawn Michaels....9/10
This Match was just BRUTAL!  Lots of blood from the two superstars...Shawn Michaels and HHH gave there souls, there energy, everything into this match....It wasn't the best Hell in a Cell match..But it was a good one....This match was very slow in the begining and in the middle but starts to pick up near the end...Tables, Ladders and Chairs were all of good use in this match....This HIAC was much better than the one last year at Bad Blood when it was Triple H Vs Kevin Nash.....
And sadly HBK did not win....And sadly no one got out of the cell and went to the top of the cell...I was really hoping HBK would do an elbow drop from the top of the cell to the announce ment table with HHH laying on it...But it didn't because of HBK's back problems... but still this was a great Event that won't be forgotten....
I give it a 9.3 out of 10...",1087084800,,2343,4.636144578313253

8023862,3,B00028G6U8,"La Resistance VS Chris Benoit & Edge: Benoit is also wrestling in the main event and the ending made perfect sense. Benoit had a member of La Resistance in a crippler crossface and here comes Kane to cause a DQ. It was a decent match but this seemed like something they should have pulled on Raw. The match was decent but nothing to great.

Tomko VS Chris Jericho: This match was bad and the ending looked really look.

Randy Orton VS Shelton Benjamin: I liked Orton's entrance and Benjamin still can't cut a good promo. A good match but it did lag in the middle but the end picked up. Flair interferes (big surprise) and Benjamin goes after him. He throws Flair in the ring and fights both him and Orton off. He gets in a few more near falls including a small package as he had Flair in a figure four leg lock. Orton rolled him up with a hand full of tights to retain the title.

Lita VS Gail Kim VS Trish VS Victora: Four women who can wrestle but yet, I still do not care to watch.

Eugene VS The Coach: I hated Eugene beyond words but probably not as bad as Hornswoggle. This was a disgrace to the PPV and people who paid over 50 bucks to see this event. I'm so glad they got rid of this retard.

Chris Benoit VS Kane: I never enjoyed Kane but he can rise to the occasion. Kane works on the arm so Beniot couldn't go for the crossface. Kane does a good job as he beats Benoit for most of the match. Benoit's first real offense move is a sharpshooter and then three German suplexs. Benoit gets the crossface on but Kane gets out of it but Benoit rolls him up and wins it. The match was slow paced and Benoit didn't look on his game at all.

Shawn Michaels VS Triple H:  The longest Hell in the Cell match on record as many people point out. This was an excellent match but it sucked Michaels jobbed to Triple H.

Overall, besides the main event, this event sucked. Nothing worth checking out expect the main event but you could get the Hell in the Cell dvd instead of this event.",1259539200,,1982,4.170157068062827

But probably this event will most likely be known for the tremendous hell in a cell match between the heartbreak kid, shawn michaels and the game, triple h.

1. World Tag Team Titles
La Resistance vs. Chris Benoit & Edge
This was an alright opener. you didn't see much of benoit in this match unil the end. Edge mostly gets isolated in this one. kane would come out and cause the dq. a decent tag team match. 3/5

2. Tomko w/ Trish vs. Chris Jericho
tomko isn't the best big man but jericho really made him look kind of good in this match. jericho did a good job in making tomko look good. a nice match to watch. 3.5/5

3. IC Title
Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin
before things got underway, orton came out and taunted the crowd. benjamin made his enterance and went for the quick win right away. benjamin and orton are very good athletes which made this a good match for the ic title belt to watch. flair also made his way to ringside during this match. i enjoyed this match. a very good back and forth battle between these two. 4/5

4. Women's Title
Lita vs. Gail Kim vs. Trish vs. Victoria
this was a great women's match that i've seen in a long time. these four gals gave it all out there. gail was looking pretty good in there while using her submission holds. i felt the ending was quite appropriate as well. pretty good women's match up. 3.5/5

5. Eugene vs. The Coach
I personally do not like eugene. so this match didn't catch my attention at all. i never found it amusing but the fans sure was over eugene's tactics and style in the ring. to me this match was just a poor filler with a couple a comedic spots. i did however enjoyed the stunner and the rock bottom by eugene. 1.5/5

6. World Heavyweight Title
Chris Benoit vs. Kane
i swear, benoit made kane looked like he was better than benoit himself in this match. this had to been one of kane's best one on one matches in his career. kane really took it to benoit and just kept on giving it to him. kane looked very good and so did benoit even after competing in a match beforehand. this was a great match. if it wasn't for the hell in a cell, this would for sure be the match of the night. fantastic title match. 4.5/5

7. Hell in a Cell Match
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
as other reviewers pointed out, this is indeed the longest hell in a cell bout in history. lasting over 47 mintues, this one could possibably be the best hiac match. this also was a perfect fit to end this rivalry.

it did went a little slow at times. triple h and hbk had an awesome performance in this match. the match was just gruling and brutal at the same time. both used the cell pretty good along with it's surroundings. you see a little reminiscence from their previous encounters where triple h targets the back of hbk and hbk bringing out a ladder. this hell in a cell match was unbelieveable and great. classic way to end this confrontation. 5/5

the hell in a cell match was awesome. the undercard was decent with a great world title bout. this ppv isn't a disappointer.",1224720000,,3312,4.277955271565495
8023865,4,B00028G6U8,"Bad Blood 2004 was a solid card that saw two solid main events plus a good undercard. Let's get to it:

La Resistance Vs. Chris Benoit & Edge (World Tag Team Title Match) - This was just a filler to help tease a feud between Benoit and Edge (which did happen in mid-2005) and further the Benoit/Kane storyline. Anyway, the duo was on the verge of winning the tag titles when Kane (who had a World title match with Benoit later in the card and had a situation with Edge at the time) interfered, costing the duo the titles though they did win by DQ.

Chris Jericho vs Tyson Tomko - Tomko will not go down as one of the best big men ever though he isn't bad by any means. Jericho made him look like he should've been on the Undertaker's level this night! Even the interference of Trish Stratus (who had a women's title match later) couldn't help Tomko here as Jericho took the match with a running inziguri for the win.

Randy Orton Vs. Shelton Benjammin (Intercontinental Title Match) - First great bout of the night as the I-C title is used in the way it should be and that's help elevate future stars! Good back and forth action with hilarious interference attempts by Ric Flair himself! Forgot how it ends but I do know Randy Orton takes this one and retains the I-C strap.

Victoria vs Lita vs Trish Stratus vs Gail Kim (WWE Women's Championship Match) - Admittedly, I didn't watch this one but I'll have to one day because this was back when nearly everyone in the women's division could wrestle! I do remember that Trish won this match and took the 5th of her record setting seven Women's titles.

Eugene vs Jonathon Coachman - Eugene was really over with the crowd at this point in his career while Coachman just.....SUCKED! LOL! Just kidding as he did what any good heel is supposed to do and that's get on people's nerves. He definitely did that here as Eugene took this one. I do remember laughing a lot during this match too!

Chris Benoit Vs. Kane (World Heavyweight Title Match) - While more known now for his murder of his wife Nancy and son Daniel and suicide, Chris Benoit was a great WRESTLING champion. I stress wrestling because he wasn't a great overall character like his former friend, the late (and still loved) Eddie Guerrero or Kurt Angle but in the ring, he was top shelf.

If his matches with Kurt Angle, Shawn Michaels, Guerrero and HHH isn't proof of that, this match with Kane certainly was. Not that Kane sucks because he doesn't but Benoit really elevated Kane's game here as he looked the best I've ever seen him in recent years. Ending comes out of the blue but it was one of Kane's best matches and one of Benoit's better title defenses during his one World Title reign.

HHH Vs. Shawn Michaels - In this Hell In The Cell match, HHH and Shawn proved you didn't need to do crazy stunts to make this match exciting. This was about two men who hated each other and wanted to prove to the other that they were the best. They sold this angle so good that you really believed that they were not only willing to kill the other to win, they were willing to die themselves to get their hand raised!

This was old school wrestling at its best. Think Rick Steamboat Vs. Ric Flair from 1989 or Flair Vs. Harley Race at Starrcade '83 to get an idea of what I am talking about. This wasn't no 5, 10 or even 20 minute match. This was a near 50 minute war! The kind of bout you would've saw Flair, Steamboat, Race, a young Sting or even Dusty Rhodes compete in (don't laugh, despite being so fat Dusty could go an hour if needed).

Anyway, no words can describe this match. You just need to see it. It is also on the new WWE Hell In The Cell collection that is available now.

Overall, this is a good card to get. The final two matches plus the I-C title bout makes this one a keeper in my view!",1224028800,2,3812,4.324929971988795
