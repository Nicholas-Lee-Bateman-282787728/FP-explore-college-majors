6728911,5,B00O86948Q,"It's a great movie from the start to the ending...

The lovers are great to gether and it's ending was exciting...

Buth Sean Paul Lockheart sucked in this movie...",1423353600,2,164,4.620689655172414
6728912,1,B00O86948Q,"A cute couple are headed to the childhood home of one of the men so he can show off his boyfriend and reunite with his mother and once he's home a mystery starts to unfold.

First the good.  Two good looking leading men and there was Sean Lockhart too. Easy on the eyes but a bad actor.

The bad.  The plot was silly from the get go and the guy who played the Step father and Doctor was so bad. I was waiting for him to write himself a doctors note for the bad acting and excuse himself from the rest of the movie. And mentioned above Sean Paul Lockhart is always great eye candy in this venue or his other ahem job, but here he was so over the top it was like he was not taking this seriously.
The mystery itself was a joke too and you could see the writing on the wall as far as who was the bad guys and who were the heroes. The scenery was nice and the two leading men were so cute and believable together other than that blah.",1420761600,7,930,3.9308510638297873
6728913,1,B00O86948Q,"Difficult movie to watch.  The writing is bad, I found it hard to follow any kind of story, the characters would recite dialogue that seemed to go no where and had no point.",1420156800,2,173,4.242424242424242
6728914,1,B00O86948Q,"Avoid this movie at all costs.  I don't know where to start.  Perhaps it is the ham-fisted acting, the abysmal dialogue, or the irritating score.",1420070400,3,145,4.76
6728915,4,B00O86948Q,"Very well done.  I was really surprised by how good it was.  Good storyline, especially for a gay-thriller.  Most of the acting was pretty good.  Film quality was really good!  A little strange in parts I agree, but I felt more excited, and emotional watching this than embarrassed (which is how I feel after most gay thrillers).  I would recommend.",1419897600,5,349,4.733333333333333
6728916,4,B00O86948Q,"The movie is well directed, acted and written.
The young actors do well and hold their own in the film.
The plot is familiar, just different in sexual orientation of the characters.

This small indie movies (in my opinion) are the backbone of the movie industry.
The mega budget movies are not filling the gap for good film making.
Well worth a viewing.",1419811200,4,353,4.603174603174603
6728917,3,B00O86948Q,"A bit strange which made the movie seem even longer.  The story line is interesting and with a host of not a large cast, the variety of unique personalities to say the least did keep my interest going.  I thought it was well shot and the overlaid imagery of the main character's insights of being able to see clips of events was well done.  This is one of the better gay-themed movies I have seen in awhile.  I wouldn't stop the clock or a party to watch this movie; but if you have sometime and aren't doing anything give it a shot.",1418860800,10,533,4.196078431372549
6728918,3,B00O86948Q,A bit farfetched but the performances are very earnest.,1485388800,,55,5.222222222222222
6728919,1,B00O86948Q,"While this movie looked slick-- it had high production values, and looked like it was very professionally made-- it really was just awful. The script was awful and I think the directing was really poor. It seemed like the actors had the ability to turn in better performances than they did, but some of the choices the director made about how dialogue was delivered needed to be rethought. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. And Sean Paul Lockhart should just go back to being Brett Corrigan",1481587200,,511,4.565217391304348
6728920,4,B00O86948Q,"First of all, I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. If you are homophobic, there may be a couple scenes you will want to pass but otherwise it is merely a part of the overall movie and not the principal point. this is a mystery and suspense movie. Keegan Dark brings his mew boyfriend home to see mom who he hasn't spoken with in a long time. She is now married to a man with a son and they live with her and are helping her to get her vineyard on a paying basis. Strange things begin to happen to Keegan and no one believes him because he has a very checkered past. I will admit that I figured out almost everything and they stumped me on one thing. the performances were pretty good and the 3 leads are more than capable (hot too) Blaise Embry as Keegan, Timo Descamps as his new boyfriend and Sean Paul Lockhart as Keegan's new stepbrother.",1474416000,,858,4.237804878048781
6728921,4,B00O86948Q,"This is a great movie. I love the fact that there's no coming out BS. No coming of age. No homophobia. Just a good mystery where the characters happen to be gay (or bi). Good writing, love the humor. Good acting. Nice locations.

I'd recommend watching twice, as the twists can be a little difficult to follow. This is one of the reasons I think the film feels long. There's a lot happening, and at towards the end I think I was feeling a little overwhelmed.",1469491200,,458,4.325581395348837

6728929,3,B00O86948Q,"This movie was a little hard to follow, I would not watch it with a much of people because it was hard it watch it by my self but to have other talking
and try to put thing together might make it even harder. If you like movie that start out like a Hitchcock movie this one will work well for you.",1437523200,,297,3.806451612903226
6728930,4,B00O86948Q,"THE DARK PLACE is a convoluted mystery with murderous overtones that revolves around a young man named Keegan Dark (played by Blaise Embry) who decides to return to his family home in order to resolve past familial issues and to celebrate his mother's forthcoming birthday. KD has a most unusual character talent. He can remember the past in vivid visual terms with an astonishing photographic accuracy. He can even mentally enhance and enlarge those images if necessary. He also has visual premonitions that are not as precise nor as clear- and therein lies his problem and burden.  KD is gay and brings his partner/boyfriend with him. There is a gay sub-text to this movie that may or may not be critical to the main storyline (No Spoilers Here).  Upon his arrival, KD discovers that his widowed mother has not only remarried without telling him but he also has a new step-brother (played by Sean Paul Lockhart).  From the outset, KD is suspicious of both his new parent and sibling. His mother is the owner of a large private family vineyard which produces some noteworthy wine and is worth a considerable amount of money. Are KD's fears overreactive or justified? While looking for a bottle of wine in a supposedly secure place, KD is suddenly knocked unconscious.  There is no apparent explanation for what happened.  Then, in the midst of investigating the background of his new ""family members"", his mother suddenly falls into a coma, his boyfriend who has become fed up with KD's concerns and actions disappears without a word, and the local sheriff believes that KD is somehow responsible for everything that has happened.  Without revealing anything else, The Dark Place turns into a kind of deadly race.  Can KD's unusual mental ability thwart the intentions of his supposed enemies if, indeed, they do have any nefarious intentions?  Where is his boyfriend?  What will be the fate of his mother?  If she dies, who will inherit the lucrative vineyard business? Can KD come to terms with his step-father and step-brother? I offer one tantalizing clue to the readers of this review: Consider the casting for this film.",1436918400,4,2127,4.916201117318436
6728931,5,B00O86948Q,"Originally thought that this film was another one of those blood & guts-who-done-it.  What a very wrong impression.  This is a combination love story/detective story with more twists than a Agatha Christi tale.  Please, pay attention, as it is very easy to get lost and confused in all the action.  EVENTS IN ONE'S LIFE CAN CLOUD A LOVING RELATIONSHIP!  NJMJr!",1434931200,2,360,4.933333333333334

6728933,3,B00O86948Q,Its ok,1431648000,,6,2.5
6728934,4,B00O86948Q,"The story is a well written, smart mystery that doesnt rely on over-drawn stereotypes, or caricature personas to create character or entertainment value. The Dark Place keeps with a more serious tone, building a tense story arc that aims to draw viewers in with drama, action, and suspense. At times the story takes itself a bit too serious missing some moments that could have shown a comfortable, authenticity.

The special effects and sound effects didn't really impress me, the special effects wear minimal. Wheeler had plenty of opportunity to show a darker, grittier, and more visceral side but chose to play it safe. Letting the drama, and dialog support most of the thrills. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. I would have liked to have seen more gruesome effects during altercation and action scenes.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by The Dark Place. The characters were not cartoonish stereotypes, and the story was a serious mystery, thriller. Even with the rough start, The Dark Place manages to become a captivating thriller. It is above most LGB&T thrillers that I have seen. There isn't really any horror elements in the film, and the thrills are hit/miss throughout, so that was a slight disappointment. Still, Jody Wheeler does have a solid story here.",1431216000,2,1284,5.05188679245283

6728944,4,B00O86948Q,"This film had enough in the way of eye candy and plot to keep me interested, and although it certainly didn't break any new cinematic ground, it was really quite entertaining. On the negative side, the final action scene at the end was definitely exciting enough, but more than a little far-fetched....in fact, that final gunshot was almost comedic.  And shall we discuss the acting of the stepfather / doctor?  Yeah, let's not go there...",1424649600,3,439,4.84
6728945,4,B00O86948Q,"While we see Sean-Paul front and center here the story actually, centers around another character; but don't let that disuade you. If you are interested and have seen his other movies since debuting in film i think the dark place definetly shows that he has talent and a future as a character driven actor rather than just that pretty face we love so much. Not to take away from the rest of the cast as well that played terrific roles with an appropriate amount of depth all there own. While we may expect the twist its no less enjoyable to watch a full story unfold through its various nooks and cranies.",1423958400,5,605,4.45945945945946

8682478,4,B00O86948Q,"To be honest, I tried watching this movie last night, and turned it off after about 10 minutes.  The sound quality and the first few flashbacks were a huge turn off for me.  I decided I was going to write a 1 star review...however, when I sat down to write my review, I read some if the others and decided to give it another chance.  I'm glad I did...in the end, I really enjoyed it.  It was a nice little psychological thriller  with characters who happen to be gay, not gay themed.  I thought the actors did a pretty good job and fit their roles, except for the lawyer/ex boyfriend...I didn't find him believable and almost too young for the role he was trying to play.

The basic premise of the movie focuses on a young man with a eidetic memory with a troubled past, returning home with his new boyfriend to visit his mother...and the surprising twist of finding she remarried and he is now part of a blended family.  Greed takes over from there...and movie follows the pursuit of the almighty dollar...and a few predictable and unexpected twists.  There is also some dark humor...

I'm not really a fan of movies that have ""flashbacks""...but, after the first few, it was more tolerable...although, some were confusing.  It was a movie had to hit rewind many time because the characters were hard to hear and understand even with CC on.

All in all...I'm glad I gave the movie a second chance...and pushed past the first 20 minutes.

Also, like many movies...I really do think your mood at the time is the biggest factor in our ratings.",1496793600,,1540,4.536231884057971
8682479,1,B00O86948Q,"A terrible movie.  The actors are attractive, but mumble their lines unless they are shouting.  Perhaps they are intelligible because the sound engineering is so bad.  Lack of continuity - sloppy editing.",1493510400,,204,5.3125
8682480,1,B00O86948Q,"Just awful..the script is badly written, the dialogue seems to be too intellectual to come out of those shallow characters, hence, fake.  the acting is horrible...",1492819200,,163,5.269230769230769
8682481,3,B00O86948Q,"I enjoyed the film. Most of the acting is good, the actors good-looking, and the film has an interesting premise--the literally photographic (or should I say videographic?), memory of the central character. Clearly there are three suspicious characters from the moment our hero arrives at his mother's home--his new stepfather, his new stepbrother (too obviously a nasty character), and his ex-lover (now his mother's lawyer), who glowers at him menacingly from the get-go. And, of course, the police are idiots. Some of the twists of plot are far-fetched and the motivation of the bad guys is a bit fuzzy, but the filmmakers have been wise to stick to the point of view of the central character, who isn't the nicest guy in the world. In fact my main question is why his sweet Belgian lover is so devoted to him. Not a masterpiece but fun.",1491350400,,840,4.8
