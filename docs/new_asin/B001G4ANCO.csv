8303767,5,B001G4ANCO,"I was very pleased with this documentary. Doesn't go into detail about certain verses that are constantly used against the gay community by the church, and an analysis of their varied interpretations, but that was fine with me. That 's why I also have For the Bible Tells Me So and Fish Out of Water. Nevertheless, still a great addition to add to my collection.",1434412800,,362,4.584615384615384
8303768,4,B001G4ANCO,"Good, but, not as good as ""For The Bible Tells Me So.""  I would still recommend it.",1421452800,,83,3.8823529411764706
8303769,4,B001G4ANCO,"this is a solid study of the gay that exists between the mainstream church and the LGBT community.

this should be viewed as supplemental to the A+ documentary, For The Bible Tells Me So.",1266883200,2,187,4.5
8303770,5,B001G4ANCO,"This film will challenge your understanding about God really thinks about Gay people. Whether you are heterosexual or homosexual, you will want to hear these stories of faith from men and women who are bridging the Gap. It is a way to continue the dialogue, and put a human face on those who have experienced rejection and isolation.  An excellent gift to any pastor, parent, or friend who wants to understand and be part of the solution!",1228867200,10,438,4.688311688311688
