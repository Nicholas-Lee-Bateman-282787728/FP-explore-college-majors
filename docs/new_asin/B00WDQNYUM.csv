7130344,5,B00WDQNYUM,sweet movie,1431388800,,11,5.0
7130345,4,B00WDQNYUM,"I have to admit, I am a huge fan of both Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton. They carried the movie, story was SLOW. However, I loved their chemistry together. The story is this, they have lived in their Brooklyn apartment for 40 years. Stairs are getting harder to climb as they age as there is no elevator in the building. They think maybe sell and move somewhere else. So, a shark of a niece realtor helps them list the apartment and try to sell it. Meanwhile, the couple goes apartment shopping on their own. Bidding war breaks out on their apartment, and they enter into a deal to buy another apartment. Do they buy? Do they sell? I won't spoil the ending for you. Good movie. Slow. But I loved the actors so it was a 4 star for me.",1431216000,74,734,4.25
7130346,5,B00WDQNYUM,"My husband and I rented this as a 'Mothers Day' treat, & it was certainly that.  Perhaps you have to be of a certain age to appreciate this piece, but those that are, will...  Enjoy!",1431216000,2,182,4.171428571428572
7130347,5,B00WDQNYUM,Its a heartwarming and endearing movie. Definitely worth having in someone's video repertoire,1431216000,41,93,6.230769230769231
7130348,2,B00WDQNYUM,"I wanted to love this movie. It looked like a feel good story and it is, but it's very boring. Storyline  is mediocre and I fast forwarded through the last 10 minutes of the movie because I wanted to know how it ends. That said, I love Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton.  Great actors!",1431129600,11,283,4.222222222222222
7130349,2,B00WDQNYUM,"How interested are you in Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton? I mean, really? Both are tremendous, even legendary actors that have commanded audiences for years, and it could be said they've actually grown more charming with age. But are Freeman and Keaton charming enough that anybody would want to watch them rifle through Classifieds and house hunt for 90 minutes? Because that's all you're going to get from low-risk dramedy 5 Flights Up.

Freeman and Keaton play septuagenarian couple Alex and Ruth, who have decided to sell their beautiful Brooklyn apartment after 40 years of building memories there. Why? The city is changing all around them; the old stores are gone, replaced by cool and hip chains that are attracting younger people to the city. The biggest problem is the five flights of stairs they must climb every day, which is getting to be too much in their older age. So they hire their pit bull of a niece (Cynthia Nixon) to help find a buyer while setting out to locate a new place to live. There's your movie. No seriously, that's it. Okay, there's a go-nowhere subplot involving their cute dog Daisy's trip to the vet, and something about a terrorist rampaging through the streets snarling traffic and driving away potential buyers. Neither of these move the story needle one bit, though, but then again nothing really does.

In comic books there is something called ""decompression"". It's a storytelling technique where minor events are dragged out in order to stretch a storyline, and thus sell more books. More time, less actual content. 5 Flights Up is the cinematic equivalent of ""decompression"". Ruth and Alex have their little squabbles, usually about his negativity towards the idea of moving, and they all end with them falling more in love with one another than before. There's so little tension between them that at one point Ruth has to announce, ""We're having an argument! It's perfectly okay that they are an extremely happily married couple, but their tiny problems don't hold any real weight. Nothing really threatens their happiness, except for the line of jerk New York stereotypes who attend their Open House. Director Richard Loncraine (of the unfortunate tennis comedy Wimbledon) lays on the sappiness thick and syrupy.

At the same time, it's difficult to outright crush this film because Freeman and Keaton are so enjoyable together. They have the easy chemistry of a married couple who have been through a lot and have come to accept the other's flaws. There's no romantic chemistry, though, and any passion between Ruth and Alex is seen in flashback to their early encounters. Young Alex (Korey Jackson) was just starting out as an artist while Ruth (Claire van der Boom) was his muse. Jackson and van der Boom bear striking resemblances to their counterparts, and it's through them that we see the troubles Ruth and Alex endured as an interracial couple. She also suffers from fertility problems while he struggles to forge a career.

This is all based on a novel by JillCiment, and it's unfathomable that anybody would read this motionless story without the benefit of Freeman and Keaton.  We may be willing to watch them in just about anything, but 5 Flights Up is too far of a climb for this.",1431129600,16,3238,4.901459854014599
7130350,5,B00WDQNYUM,Wonderful movie. Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton did a great job! A must see,1526169600,,76,4.5
7130351,5,B00WDQNYUM,Looking for a movie to watch that was not filled with explicit sex scenes I came across this movie. I had seen it before but thought that I would watch it again. I am such a fan of Morgan Freeman and I like Diane Keaton as well. I so enjoyed the movie - had to laugh in some parts - such as the news media and their over the top news coverage - so typical. The climbing of the stairs and the poor dog - I felt their pain. I was wondering why they did not try and buy an apartment in their building on a lower floor. At the end of the movie it shows a couple moving in on a lower floor. Just a thought - maybe they just do not become available. Very good movie.,1525651200,,660,3.789855072463768

7130356,2,B00WDQNYUM,"So boring, even with these great actors. I love Morgan Freeman, and still do in this film. I like Diane Keaton unless she's playing her nervous neurotic Woody Allen-films character (and here she is so it was just annoying). This whole film (with the exception of a few somehow-satisfying moments of Morgan in his studio) was so much empty dialogue about nothing really. Unless you just love the angst of selling your apartment in NY and trying to buy a new one and your dog is in surgery, which is completely and entirely this whole film, with a couple flash backs to them getting together early on.., it's just so boring and pointless. Not anything to light me up at all. Just felt like wasted time.",1522972800,,700,4.563492063492063

7130396,5,B00WDQNYUM,"This is a really wonderful movie.  The entire movie revolves around a couple selling an apartment and looking for a new one, while waiting for news about their much loved dog Dorothy's surgery for spinal damage.  Freeman and Keaton are two of the best, and they play their roles to perfection in this film.  The supporting cast does an excellent job as well.  This movie is about a couple coming of age and the issues all of us face when doing so.  It is about making a difficult choice between what you love and what you need.  This is the portrayal of a good and strong marriage that has endured and will continue to do so.  Great movie for any age, but especially for those of us entering into our ""golden years"" phase.",1485820800,3,722,4.383458646616542

No deep soul eye contact, except once, older couples still in a passionate relationships always read each other through their eyes. Diane did not seem to have the right chemistry with Morgan freeman. I think  a better leading lady would of been someone like Blythe Danner. I love Diane Keaton, but all her movies seem like clones of one another, she plays herself not the part.

An ""elderly"" mixed-race couple trying to sell a $1 million Brooklyn apt. who own an ailing dog needing and getting a $10,000 operation. Kinda hard to ""relate"" to ANYTHING in their world. The husband was a dreadful no-talent painter who never sold anything; we never learned what the retired wife did (art student?). But, because they bought their Brooklyn apt. when it was rundown & cheap before Brooklyn real estate took off, all they had to do was sit tight for 40 yrs to be able to sell at $1 million.

7130454,1,B00WDQNYUM,"I've never been disappointed in a movie with Morgan Freeman before this one.  I finished it because I kept thinking it would get better, especially given the acting talent.  Well, unfortunately it didn't.  The plot went nowhere and it felt like an overlong TV show - everyone was trying too hard and it all felt quite shallow.  If you want to watch a heartwarming movie with Morgan Freeman, I'd suggest you re-watch Shawshank Redemption and steer clear of this one.",1468540800,,465,4.775

And the film is funny... for those who do not understand New York and why people would ever want to live there, this is a lesson in how living in the city works, from the inside.

7130555,4,B00WDQNYUM,"A film with two of our best actors, dramatic but with humor, intimate and realistic, but not dark. Here we have Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman--who are delightful together--as a longtime married couple, now seniors and choosing to put their apartment up for sale because the real estate market has it valuated at roughly a million bucks. He's an artist and she was an artist's model when they met. As their imminent upheaval has them examining parts of their lives--what they will do in their last years, what may happen to their ill also-aging dog, what will happen with his artistic career since his style of art is ""not in,"" according to the son of their many-decades art dealer (another incident of passing baton/aging/change).

The pleasure is, of course, in watching seasoned and charming actors do their thing in a small story of people facing their golden years and the big changes that folks have to make sometimes. Moving out of one's decades-long home is pretty stressful. There is humo rin watching the assemblage of house-hunters pass through--some likable, some rude, some eccentric--and Cynthia Nixon is a zealous real estate agent handling the bids and open houses.

I love the quiet scene in the painting studio (aka second bedroom) where Morgan Freeman talks to the daughter of one of the prospective (but not) house hunters, a sweet-faced young actress. He shows her how to work an LP and turntable and he explains how one nude portrait was his wife as she looked on the day they met. We get a flashback to the meeting. And we get other flashbacks to other times in the couple's lives in previous decades.

If you love these actors,you will thoroughly enjoy their gentle, mature chemistry. If you love seeing New York spots in a non-action flick, here you go.

I liked this a lot and would love to have dinner with this oh-so-likable couple. A lovely little flick even if we saw the ending coming a mile away. :D

Note: Stick around for the end credits if you have HD/Blu-Ray. The air-view sequence of NYC is really quite lovely and nostalgic for those of us who lived there once-upon-a-time. :D",1447286400,2,2115,4.76775956284153

7130583,4,B00WDQNYUM,"'Alex' and 'Ruth Carver' (Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton)have been married for many years and have lived
in their 'Brooklyn' apartment throughout this time, and have remained content.
Trouble is, they are not getting any younger, climbing 5 flights of stairs everyday is not something one can do
forever, perhaps for the 'Carver's' it's time to consider their future.
With the help of 'Ruth's' niece 'Lily' (Cynthia Nixon) an estate-agent the couple put their much-loved apartment
on the market.....which triggers a whirlwind experience in real-estate wheeling and dealing.
Whilst the decisions are being mulled-over there is a story-back-drop of a suspected 'terrorist' at large in the
neighbourhood, also the additional worry of a health-issue for the couples beloved dog - 'Dorothy'
Maybe not everybody's cup-of-tea, it's quite simply 'A Pleasant Watch'

Both make believable that their characters' devotion to one another is eternal and real.  This type of vehicle is old hat for Keaton not so much for Freeman.  It was obviously a labor of love for him because he's listed as one of the film's producers.  I'd also like to give a special shout out to Claire van der Boom and Korey Jackson who play in flashback the main characters in credible fashion.

7130659,5,B00WDQNYUM,"Four and a half ENJOYABLE Stars! ""5 Flights Up"" is a persuasive movie starring 2 Oscar-winners, Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton, who light up this movie as an aging couple living 5 floors up in a nice Brooklyn, New York apartment with a great view of the Williamsburg Bridge that they have owned for 40 years. The value has soared and they are looking into selling it for big bucks. There are laugh out loud moments amid some serious underlying topics that could affect their lives: aging, relatives, a tense city, and a cherished pet. Freeman is a painter and Keaton is a retired teacher and they are tiring of the stair climb in a building with no elevators, but deeper, more subtle themes are running underneath the surface issues of this film, such as their initial welcome to the building, compared to 40 years later. Claire Van Der Boom and Korey Jackson are excellent as the couple in younger years. Also, there is a marvelous performance by Cynthia Nixon (Sex in the City). Directed by Richard Loncraine and produced by Lori McCreary, this movie is Very Definitely Recommended. Four and a half SPLENDID Stars! (Universal. PG-13 for language and nude paintings, color, CC.

Certainly glad we rented instead of buying.  It wasn't worth the rent, let alone the price to buy.  I would would have left and gone home, except I WAS home.

7130758,5,B00WDQNYUM,"It is so refreshing to watch a film with a contemporary story that focuses on older people and their choices and strengths instead of seeing them act foolish or pathetic. Based on Jill Ciments book as adapted for the screen by Charlie Peters and directed with straightforward good taste by Richard Loncraine, this quiet little film is a wonderful platform for tow of our most respected actors  69 year old Diane Keaton and 78 year old Morgan Freeman  who create an irresistible chemistry.

Briefly, long-time happily married couple Ruth and artist Alex Carver (Keaton and Freeman) who've spent their lives together in the same New York apartment become overwhelmed by personal and real estate-related issues when they plan to move away, having decided to cash in on their sought-after Brooklyn apartment. The story opens with one of the reasons they feel the need to move after 40 years in the 5 flights up apartment with no elevator: their little dog Dorothy is having difficulty maneuvering the stairs and ends up with a slipped vertebral disc that requires a Vets expertise and surgery. They engage Ruth's niece, real estate agent Lily (Cynthia Nixon, who is wonderfully, gushingly obnoxious) and the visits to the apartment begin  all manner of rather despicable lookie-loos traipse through and a decision must be made. Ruth and Alex find an apartment in Manhattan that is one the 9th floor and has an elevator, but issues arise that make them alter their initial decision.

Beautifully understated is the fact that Ruth and Alex are childless, entered an interracial marriage when it was not fashionable to do so, and have grown old together making every day count. They are wonderful and the film does them justice. It is such a pleasure to see two seasoned and gifted actors make such an impressive statement.

Recommended for all those who think happiness is dependent on the social media base.  Grady Harp, August 15",1440028800,,1925,4.959627329192546

7130771,5,B00WDQNYUM,"A note from Mrs. L-

Every Friday night is date night at our house. We wheel in the rolling table with drinks and a healthy feast and curl up on the couch and pick a movie or two and just set out to relax and enjoy the weekend!  The newly released movies have been a disaster for us this summer for movie choices.  Horror movies, beat 'em up and serial killer movies. Cheating on your spouse movies. Demons and devils. Bleh!

We are just sick and tired of watching that stuff.  So, I picked out several DVD's from Amazon for the summer. And 5 Flights Up was one of them.  I hadn't heard any reviews of it and had a small idea about the content, but Diane Keeton?  Morgan Freeman?  Love these two actors.

WE loved the movie!!!!! After all of the depressing horror, violent, murderous, psychosexual drama offerings this summer, it was so nice to watch a simple and lasting  love story between two people and despite the 5 Flights Up, ;-) it has such a surprisingly happy, uncomplicated ending. Diane Keeton and Morgan Freeman were genuine and superb in the movie.  Great story!",1439769600,24,1076,4.466666666666667

Live in NYC and this movie catches all the angst and ick...my opinion but after all that is what this review is about.

7130828,5,B00WDQNYUM,"I just loved this movie.  I liked the way the film writer flipped back in time so that we could understand who this couple was and how they got together.  I loved the part about the dog but I think the Mr. Freeman should have put the coffee down and picked up the sweet little dog and carried him up the stairs.

The movie was well organized and as the action moved to the end, I hated for these people to end.  I liked the characters who came to view the apartment but in reality the real estate person should not have allowed the owner to be around the buyers.  Morgan Freeman was so laid back you could not tell what he was thinking and that was necessary for the ongoing apartment hunt and sale to reach the climax of how this story would end up.

I loved the couple.  There was just enough information about their history to leave you wanting for more.  The ending was a happy one for everybody: us the viewer and the contented couple of 40 years.  They were so sweet--you just wanted to hang around like the little girl who wanted to talk and find out more about her new acquaintance Morgan Freeman.

Surprising was the actor hired to play  Morgan Freeman.  In the first frames of the movie the actor looked like a young Morgan Freeman and sounded like him as well.  A very good choice!  The female actress was wonderful but not a look alike for Diane Keaton.  I personally think it would
be very difficult to find a look alike for Diane --she is just too unusual looking--beautiful, smart, elegant and ageless.

1. Dialogue especially lines meant to be humorous or sarcastic (Freeman's lines) were the highlight of the film.
2. The buying and selling of an apartment in New York was insightful. At least those parts that might be accurate.

Negatives:
1. The young girl (accompanies mom who is looking at the apt. Freeman is selling) and appears every so often in the film while also offering sage advice to Freeman, was expecting tea as a reward yet we never see her again. That's called a loose end. I would have had her and her mom moving into another vacant apartment in that building resulting in an intelligent relationship with Freeman & Keaton (Freeman's wife).
2. Too many of the buyers/sellers were characterized as a bit too greedy, self centered or off centered for me.
3. Most importantly the script had Freeman and Keaton dissing their agent at the end (treating like trash as they turned their backs while walking away) after their last second changing of minds on selling. Particularly disconcerting given the tremendous amount of work that agent put into the sales preparation with her only compensation to be the sales commission.
4. Wasn't sure how anything was added by having a supposed terrorist; their dog in the hospital; their flashbacks; Freeman's paintings, to, what might have been, a more intelligent story.",1437955200,,1335,4.959821428571429

As soon as that part with Freeman's character played out on screen, I turned it off!!  I was bummed that Freeman read his script and still acted what was written for him and he didn't say, hey, I'm not saying this stereotypical stuff.

Just the chemistry alone between Freeman and Keaton is worth the watch, but the story is absolutely a delight. A nice perspective on whether the grass is ready greener on the other side, and even if it is... is it worth it? Memories can mean so much more.

Freeman and Keaton have good chemistry in the movie and it is sweet and sentimental but very predictable in where it ends up and the overall story thin and a bit lacking.

7130940,3,B00WDQNYUM,"It's an okay movie. Cute, as is any movie with Diane Keaton. I think Morgan Freeman makes it, though, and Dorothy, the dog. The plot and characters are predictable. With the exception of two outside Keaton and Freeman, all characters were negative. To me that didn't seem realistic. Is that what all of New York is supposed to be like? I lived there. It wasn't. I knew the ending at the beginning. And wasn't it strange that Morgan Freeman had no trouble at all climbing those five flights of stairs that I don't remember Keaton scaling once. Yet I didn't see any signs that this aging couple did anything special to be physically fit. It had me thinking of Barefoot in the Park, with unfortunate young Robert Redford, the newlywed, nearly dying walking up his five flights of stairs to his new apartment. But, all right, it was part and parcel for Baby Boomers like me. Maybe that was why it was wrapped up that way - to be marketable.",1436745600,2,936,4.511764705882353

From a practical standpoint, it makes sense, but emotionally it just doesn't.  Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton both do an excellent job with their roles, of course, but Cynthia Nixon does an equally good job as Keaton's mostly self-interested niece.

It reminded me of my husband and I, (an interracial couple) who have been together 30+ years. The communication is really great (which I think is much what this movie is about), sometimes words are necessary and yet, often not. After being with someone that long it works that way. Even the flashbacks were good, because we all do that in relationships. It seemed to be what was trying to be shown here in aiding making decisions.
I thought it was funny how they dealt with modern technology...they were involved but at a slower pace which I could identify. Managing with the current, but still remembering the early days while just living life. Excellent job in both the writing and acting of these two great stars!",1436313600,29,804,4.629370629370629

First of all I have to say this movie was OK, but being 36, if I was about 30 years older I think I would have liked it more. The story is OK but this is a movie that resonates much more with an older crowd do due the subject matter.

The plot of the movie was rather thin and some of the characters seemed to be left hanging in an almost story thread.  Also I was hoping Diane's plan would win out (spoiler alert!!) and it does not which didn't seem either realistic or optimistic to me.

But if you enjoy seeing great actors with wonderful chemistry in a charming, romantic movie with a light touch, a bit of heart tugging and some Brooklyn/New York flavor this will make you feel good.",1433116800,,504,4.361702127659575

7131063,5,B00WDQNYUM,"5 Flights Up, the new comedy/drama from director Richard Loncraine, seems like a movie from a different time. Its a story fairly small in scale, something that is rarely done these days (at least well), and we get to know these characters pretty quickly.

Its focused on a married couple - played expertly by Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman - whove lived in the same Brooklyn apartment for over forty years. Curious about how the market is faring after having this same home for such a long time, they allow their successful real-estate agent family member to list the property. Meanwhile, the two are dealing with their beloved dog whos having trouble walking (and may need surgery).

The obvious draw here is to see this seasoned duo work together, and they definitely don't disappoint. Their rapport effortlessly carries the film, and makes it a pleasure to watch. Due to this, none of the emotional scenes seem forced because the film puts in its time letting us get to know these people and really feel for them. Stylistically, its nothing special, but you really don't need any showy camerawork or flourishes to make this film enjoyable. And though I could have done without the abundance of flash-backs (which rarely work in movies), I found the film delightful as a whole. These two are both amazing screen-presences and certainly do some fantastic work here. Its the epitome of a feel-good film, and despite a few flaws, is simple and sweet to just the right amount.",1432944000,146,1475,4.826086956521739

7131107,3,B00WDQNYUM,"I liked the film but had no expectations as to what it was before I watched it. I expected a simple, well acted movie with no real surprises by 2 great actors and it was. This type of film is not Oscar worthy at the making but it was still enjoyable.
I liked their characters and the occasional flashbacks to their past and how they met. They had a relationship most would envy and the funny encounters with other characters in their search for a more ""age friendly"" apartment were sweet and realistic but not over the top.

It's not a movie I would buy and want to watch again, but I didn't feel I wasted 90 minutes.",1432684800,7,617,4.228813559322034

7131109,3,B00WDQNYUM,"Mediocre is the best way to describe this movie. An older couple considers selling their apartment and decide against it. It makes some commentary about aging - including an aging dog. It makes some commentary about news media being absolute theater. It makes some commentary about veterinarians being unscrupulous (charging upward of $10,000 dollars to correct a back problem in a ten year old dog). None of the commentary is especially new or well written. The actors are engaging to watch. If you have absolutely nothing else to watch and like the actors in this film then take the time. I feel sorry for the dog - it slipped a disk (I know it was only a movie) being dragged up 5 flights of stairs- goes through a horrible surgery and the couple still cannot make the decision to move.",1432425600,2,789,4.642857142857143
7131110,3,B00WDQNYUM,"Pretty boring dialogue. I found myself skipping through about every 10 minutes of the film.  I love both of these actors but they really didn't have
 much to work with. Having a relative/realtor telling them to F off towards the end was really over the top, not funny, and NOT realistic.  I like the premise though of jerky insensitive, reactionary, and ageist hipsters being shown for who they really are.  Honestly they're more smug and entitled than baby boomers. So the premise was good, but this was just the wrong material.",1432339200,2,529,4.78021978021978

7131120,3,B00WDQNYUM,"The renowned cast made me think this would be a memorable film, but I was mistaken.  It is instead an everyday story of commission-driven realtors coercing homeowners into decisions they would likely regret later. Luckily our stars realize this in time and back out of their house-trading frenzy.  However their very real problem of living in a Brooklyn 5-story walkup doesn't get solved after all, as they and their ancient dog revert to stair climbing for the foreseeable future.  So what was the point of the film?",1431907200,2,517,4.919540229885057
