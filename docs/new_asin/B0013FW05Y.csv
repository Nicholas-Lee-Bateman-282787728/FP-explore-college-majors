3106234,2,B0013FW05Y,"Wade and Ryan are just two kids getting ready to go their first day of High School. Their about to go through 4 of the best years of their life. Well, at least until day 1 starts. That's when Wade and Ryan see another freshman getting stuffed into a locker by 2 high school bullies. Wade, to Ryan's displeasure, decides to step in and stop what is going on. And so begins their days of being brutally picked on. It doesn't help that Wade is as skinny as a toothpick, Ryan is short and fat, and Emmit, the kid they `rescued', is about 4 feet tall and befriends them like a parasite even though Ryan doesn't want to be friends with him. Thanks to Wade, the three of them are constantly picked on and bullied around by the 2 high school bullies and there is nothing they can do about it. They even go to the principal to complain, but the principal doesn't believe it or doesn't care (couldn't figure it out) cause the bully is such a nice and polite kid in front of parents. So they take matters in to their own hands and hire a bodyguard to protect them. And in walks Owen Wilson as Drillbit Taylor. Drillbit is a homeless ex Army Ranger. He decides to work for the kids, but really he's just going to rob them blind. He just wants to leave and go to Canada, but needs to `earn' the money for the plane ticket.

The story is pretty 1-2-3 with some comedy thrown in. If I say this is a `typical' Hollywood movie, then I'm pretty sure you can guess how the rest of the story is going to go, and trust me when I say it does.

Now I'm sure you are saying, ""Yeah, but at least it's funny. It's got Owen Wilson"". Well first off, if you've seen an Owen Wilson comedy movie, then you've really seen them all. He barely changes. His comedy is the same all the time. He might be louder sometimes than others, but his delivery is the same. I'm not saying he's a terrible actor, I'm just saying his funny side is always the same (which can be bad or good depending on the viewer). Secondly, some of the story was just way too out there. For instance, we have a homeless guy, who puts on a suit, and then somehow tricks a school into letting him be a teacher. Classroom AND Gym teacher. All because he's holding a coffee mug...*being rolling eyes...now*. I honestly and truly didn't find myself laughing at this except for one scene and that was when Wade and Ryan decided to learn to take a punch. They just start hitting each other as hard as they can in all types of body parts and hearing each of them scream after each hit had me laughing pretty hard. Wade has the pre-maturist man scream ever. The half scream, half cry was so funny. But other than that, there wasn't a lot going for it. Parts of the story were so hard to believe like the teacher part mentioned above and then there was a part with ALL the parents confronting the principal and the bully, yet the parents all thought the bully was a good kid and that their own children were just over reacting. Yeah right. I think my Mom woulda slapped the crap out of anyone if they had messed with me like that kid was messing with them.

Being rated PG-13 I think helps a lot since since I think the movie would work well for kids still in middle school. Maybe they would find more humor and story in it than I did.",1210032000,8,3262,4.207667731629393
3106235,4,B0013FW05Y,"Well, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I didn't find this over the top and exagerated in anyway. Owen, I thought, put in an excellent performance, just the way I would expect him to act. The kids were great and the bully got everything he deserved and more.  Plenty of humour and an overall great movie. Would not hesitate to pickup a copy when it's released to dvd.",1207612800,3,374,4.420289855072464
3106236,4,B0013FW05Y,"Wade (Hartley), Ryan (Gentile), and Emmitt (Dorfman) are three nerdy kids in need of protection.  School bully Filkins (Frost) has decided to make their lives a living hell.  After about a week of dealing with this, they decide to hire a bodyguard.  Constrained by money, they opt for Drillbit Taylor (Wilson), an ex-military man who is currently homeless and trying to make enough money to get to Canada.  Drillbit is less than impressive though, and has to come up with a plan quickly if he wants to help the kids and himself as well.

""Drillbit Taylor"" fits the mold of the Judd Apatow-produced films, albeit in PG-13 form.  Think of it as Judd Apatow-light, and that is fine because he knows what makes good movies.  Sweetness, likeable characters, and raunchy comedy make up the mix, and for ""Drillbit Taylor"", the raunchiness is toned back to give it a PG-13 rating.  Wilson is very good as Drillbit, a con-man of sorts that really isn't that good at things.  ""Drillbit Taylor"" is an amusing addition to the Apatow family of films.",1207267200,12,1037,4.748603351955308
3106237,3,B0013FW05Y,"Drillbit Taylor makes quite an accomplishment in that it is a PG-13-rated film that has the feel of last year's R-rated Superbad. Most of the vulgarity that made Apatow's previous venture inappropriately hilarious has absconded to unknown horizons, and Drillbit is left with utilizing more crafty means at achieving laughs. Not necessarily more intelligent, but certainly less crude, the similarly hilarious lead characters all find their perfect places in this consistently amusing comedy.

Three kids experience bullying at school by antagonizer Filkins, an emancipated student who revels in terrorizing smaller kids. On their first day at high school, Wade (Nate Hartley as the Harry-Potter-like scrawny kid), Ryan (Troy Gentile as the overweight kid with the never-ending ranting) and Emmit (David Dorfman as the kid-who-gets-shoved-in-a-locker) can't seem to evade constant humiliation at the hands of nemesis Filkins. Only able to take so much, the three decide to hire a bodyguard to defend them. In a riotous job-interview montage, the trio chooses Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), an ex-black-ops and improvised weapons expert, who teaches them to stick up for themselves. During the process, Drillbit gets sidetracked with aggressive teacher Lisa (Leslie Mann) and the truth that he is nothing more than a homeless bum who yearns for the good life in Canada.

Drillbit Taylor, like Superbad, derives much of its humorous moments by forcing many continual little laughs. Quick jokes follow rapid slapstick to allow the audience to pick and choose what tickles their funny-bones. When some gags don't work, instant new ribs replace them so that no one can sit still for long. But most unique is the idea that the majority of the humor does not rely on crudeness, but the friendlier grounds of physical comedy (undergoing torment by bullies) and unexpectedly nonsensical dialogue (the love chatter between Drillbit and Lisa).

Again this comedy falls into the same storyline quicksand that plagues most recent comedies, which is allowing the conflict to become too serious. No one doubts the fact that the plot is absolutely ridiculous and that most of the concepts are exaggerated to the point of absurdity, but within this fantasy world of nerds and bullies, some things we hope to remain realistic. Things like vengeance against the bullies, getting the girls, and staying out of serious harm's way. These concepts are approached with little justice to realism, and so results in a conclusion that can only be as unlikely as the samurai-sword-wielding antagonist. That's not to say that any of it was intended to be faithful to the stereotypical perception of high school life, but most of it appears that way from the get-go.

""As long as you have a coffee cup in your hand, nobody says nothing,"" explains Drillbit, on his ease at infiltrating the school as a substitute teacher. And so as long as the humor remains appealingly gut-busting, no one questions the reasoning behind much of the juvenile antics. Where Superbad focused on nonstop sexual and gross-out humor, Drillbit stays refreshingly clean with its parody of the cool kids and the un-cool kids frequenting a typical high school. And (comedic) revenge against persecution is one of the most universally inviting themes to watch.

3106238,2,B0013FW05Y,"Movies like ""Drillbit Taylor"" really make me mad; they feature teenage characters that are absolutely nothing like real teenagers, and they tell stories that are far too serious for light-hearted comedies. They're not relatable and they're not funny, certainly not to anyone who can actually remember being a teenager. I understand that ""Drillbit Taylor"" wants to be a farce, but it completely fails because it spoofs a teenage world that was already a spoof to begin with. In other words, this movie makes fun of a life that doesn't exist. It doesn't help that the story is just plain ridiculous, amounting to nothing more than an excuse for teens to be foul-mouthed and violent. If you actually find that sophomoric sense of humor funny, then feel free to stop reading this in favor of someone else's positive review.

The film begins with two friends talking on the phone the night before the first day of high school--the tall and lanky Wade (Nate Hartley) and the short and fat Ryan (Troy Gentile), who likes rap and prefers the nickname T Dog. When the big day comes, absolutely nothing goes right: not only do they unintentionally wear the same shirt, Wade also intervenes on behalf of an uncool nerd named Jim (Ian Roberts), who's being tortured by the school bully, Filkins (Alex Cross). Now with both a powerful enemy and an unwanted friend, Wade and Ryan endure hell for the first week of school, from getting locked in the trophy display to being forced to share the same shirt at the same time. What's worse is that absolutely no one offers to help them. Considering the number of students who witness this abuse happening in broad daylight, it's disgusting that not a single one would say something to someone.

When the bullied boys reach their breaking point, they place an online want ad for a bodyguard. After screening a number of possible candidates, they meet Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), who impresses them so much that they immediately hire him. Forget about the fact that he looks, sounds, and behaves nothing like an authentic bodyguard, and let's just focus on his back-story for a minute--he's a homeless AWOL military officer who sees the boys' situation as a way to make money. Under the guise of being their bodyguard, he plans to rob them blind and use their money to run away to Canada. A loser conning adults is one thing, but a loser conning teens is just plain wrong; even if that does happen in real life--and I'm sure it does--it's not something that a movie should make light of.

In realizing he can't immediately take the money and run, Taylor wings his way through a makeshift training program, which is so pathetic it's a wonder they didn't catch onto his scheme sooner. The time eventually comes for Taylor to pose as one of the school's teachers, and amazingly, the staff accepts him on the spot. This is especially true of the English teacher, Lisa (Leslie Mann), who lusts after Taylor pretty much the instant she meets him in the teacher's lounge. Why she feels this way, I have no idea; she says she has a self-destructive tendency to gravitate towards losers and bums, but even then, it's hard to imagine why she acts the way she does. I was actually scared of this woman--she jumps onto Taylor and has sex with him so frequently that she seemed more like a stalker instead of a lover.

Eventually comes the climactic moment when Wade challenges Filkins to a fight. Without Taylor's help (for reasons I won't reveal), Wade and Ryan train each other how to take physical pain, and of course, it ends with both boys cupping their genitals in agony. At the very least, that scene was just being goofy, meaning it was a little funny. The same can't be said for the final fight between them and Filkins. This isn't a case of three boys engaging in a comedic fistfight; two minors and a psychotic eighteen-year-old are violent at a level you wouldn't even see on YouTube. They use telephones and lamps to bash each other over the head. They kick each other into furniture and handrails. Even a samurai sword gets involved, resulting in someone losing a finger.

What part of this sounds entertaining? What part of this sounds funny? To anyone who feels that I'm being overly harsh and just need to lighten up, let me reassure you that even I like to laugh from time to time. Actually, I love to laugh, pretty much like everyone else. But good grief, the line has to be drawn somewhere; teen comedies in and of themselves are fine, but if you see the humor in placing a severed finger in a cocktail to keep it sterile, I'm afraid you've lost me. ""Drillbit Taylor"" is like an arrogant comedian, thinking it's much funnier than it actually is, sinking down low in a desperate attempt for a laugh. Its portrayal of teens is sad, not only because it's so over the top, but also because, even if these characters existed, no one would ever want to be like them, anyway. But the title character is the worst of all--a man that uses young boys for financial gain is the stuff of drama, not comedy. If you disagree with that or with anything else I've said, why did you bother reading the entire review?",1206057600,9,5139,4.649064906490649

With the frosh high schoolers it was stealing property from Ryan's parents' house.  Then too there is the organization of ""schools"" to provide access for homosexist criminal assaults under such euphemisms as ""physical education"" and ""sports fan"" judges requiring convicted criminal players violent outside their homosexual dominance rituals to do the ""public service"" of urging fed up young people to ""stay in school"" so that their wannabe criminal thugs have bodies to brutalize.

3106831,3,B0013FW05Y,"Drillbit Taylor

 This light comedy about high school boys stars Owen Wilson.  In the tradition of John Wayne, Wilson always seems to play Wilson in every one of his movies.  People who like him, which is nearly everybody so far as I can tell, don't seem to mind.  I don't mind, but it is acting of a certain kind.  He is funny and charming always, it is the same in this one.
 Wilson plays a down and out army deserter who lives in the brush in what looks like Santa Monica.  Three high school freshmen hire him to protect them from a psychopathic senior class bully.  As it happens, Drillbit Taylor, the bodyguard, has issues about personal confrontation and indeed about violence in general.
 There were several good laughs during the movie, but no real side splitters.  There is a superfluous romantic attachment between Owen Wilson and Leslie Mann.  The boys are awkward, geeky, earnest and endearing which is a plus.  The script is much less filled with foulness and bad language than other recent offerings in the genre, which is a plus as far as I am concerned.  The same team produced last years potty mouthed Super Bad.  They dialed back the nastiness several degrees for this one.
 This light hearted comedy is light in all respects.  It is rated PG and runs for one hour and 42 minutes.  I can muster only two and a half saw blades for the thin and unremarkable Drillbit Taylor.  There is only one brief smooch and no nudity.",1472342400,,1437,4.54296875

3106923,2,B0013FW05Y,"First off I bought this Blu-ray for like a buck, so how could I go wrong.  Even with shipping it was like $4.  In the end, however, I still felt slightly ripped off.  Not sure what Owen Wilson was thinking after making such great movies as The Royal Tannenbaums and The Life Aquatic, hell even Wedding Crashers, but perhaps he didn't even read the script before signing on.  Here you have a group of misfit kids starting high school.  You have the shy skinny geek and the fat outlandish geek and they wind up teaming up with the spastic incoherent geek and there off.  Day one and they make the acquaintance of the school bully and his toady (Josh from Drake & Josh no less)and the beatings, pantsings, and arbitrary humiliations begin.  Tired of the same thing every day, our three geeky heroes decide to hire a bodyguard. Enter Drillbit Taylor (Wilson) a homeless layabout who needs to earn some cash to make his way to Canada where he believes the good life is.  The geek squad hires Drillbit thinking that he is some ex-paramilitary killing machine and all their problems with the bully will be over.  No. Drillbit is just a jerk and he's totally afraid of violence. He's there for the money.  You can see where this is going, right?

Seriously, the premise here has been used so many times that even to mock it would be a waste of time.  The kids are charming and funny and pathetic and that makes you remember how you were when high school was the scariest place on earth.  But the bully is over 18 and emancipated and some of the things he does to the three are so outrageous as to require jail time.  So in the end, the movie just comes off as irritating. Wilson looks bored here, as if he can't even believe he's a part of this train wreck.  Perhaps he was drunk when he signed the contract? Or owed someone a huge favor? Who knows.  In the end, if you find yourself watching Drillbit Taylor, hopefully you only NetFlixed it. Look on in horror and smile maybe once, then flush it from your mind with anything else.",1366588800,,2023,4.412398921832884

3106934,2,B0013FW05Y,"Taken on its own, Drillbit Taylor is a film that's too grounded in reality to be that funny. Considering the pedigree involved in writing the project, add the phrase ""Exceedingly disappointing"" to it also. You see, John Hughes came up with the story, and Seth Rogan co-wrote the screenplay. No, this isn't an Ethan Cohen vs. Etan Cohen situation here, these are the John Hughes & Seth Rogan that you know and love. So how did this film go so wrong?

First off, the story. The plot revolves around three bullied kids hiring a bodyguard to protect them, except the bodyguard is actually a homeless person, and doesn't really have any credentials to be bodyguarding. Sound familiar? It should. The plot derives cliches from every bully plot or sub-plot in movie history, every character pretending who they're not, then being found out plot or sub-plot you've ever seen, and a myriad of other random high school cliches. And since the script was co-written by Seth Rogan, who also did Superbad, you can derive a dozen similarities to that movie as well. In fact, in that respect, Drillbit Taylor seems like the prequel to Superbad. There's the tall, geeky kid that has trouble with the ladies. There's his smart-mouthed friend, who also happens to be chubby. And they even have their third member, who isn't really a core member, but can be helpful/crazy when you need him to be. But Michael Cera, Jonah Hill & Christopher Mintz-Plasse these kids aren't. They're bad actors, and they sell little if anything about their characters. The adults are good actors, but with the exception of Owen Wilson and maybe Danny McBride, everybody is reduced to little more than cartoon characters. In one scene, the bully charms all the parents and the school principal with a stupid joke and a smile, and everybody acts like he was Jesus Christ. Granted, this fits into the cliche in these films that adults are stupid and you must take it upon yourself to stand up for yourself, but that's Home Alone logic. And at least in that film, the adults weren't total buffoons.

But that being said, the highlight of the film, and the only real reason you should think about watching this film is Owen Wilson. Wilson brings a certain charm to the character and makes the most out of a poorly-written character that's story-arch is a little bit non-existent. Wilson's character starts off as a greedy jerk, then turns into a nice guy, with the implication of one scene being the only explained reason. Then there's the fact that Drillbit can't really fight, then turns into a kicking bad-ass in the one ending scene that makes of the film's DVD cover.

Which brings me to this: The film isn't that funny. There's some gags that work, and the charms of a few of the actors make jokes more funny than they really are, but there simply isn't much here to laugh at. This is mainly due to the fact that there's little place for true humor in the story. Why? Because the bully is an unrelenting and dangerous psychopath that threatens people and commits bodily harm to them with a freakin' samurai sword. Thus, the confrontational scenes are utterly brutal to watch. It's like watching a mouse crawling into a lion's cage. You admire its perseverance, but you known that the Lion has the ability and the desire to shred such a cute thing. It's not funny, it's just uncomfortable and scary. The story tries to add humor around these situations, but every one of them falls flat. Especially the ones that involve topics such as balls. Oh, and if you've ever had past experience, or have been traumatized by a bully, you'll be traumatized by watching this film. I felt traumatized and I haven't even been in that situation.

Overall, if you're a HUGE Owen Wilson fan, then check out this movie, and you'll find something you like. Otherwise, skip it like it's a fat girl at the prom dance. There's not much to like, there's not much to think about, there's not that much to laugh at, and in the end, you just feel bad.",1283731200,5,3985,4.680456490727532

They met many candidates (one of the candidates is Chuck Liddell by the way), however they decide eventually to hire Drillbit Taylor. Now Drillbit Taylor told them he is an ex-miliatry fighter, but in reality he is only a street begger looking to make some extra money.

Nice movie with some funny scenes. The funniest scenes are the ones where the students were bullied around. The craziest things were done to them.

This movie kinda reminded me of the high school I went to. We didn't have nasty bullies like the ones in this movie, however we had some bullies that needed some butt wooping in order to behave well. I believe that if you stand up for yourself in High School and manage to earn others' respect, you will be able to do the same thing in the rest of your life.",1253750400,2,1038,4.4867724867724865
3106938,2,B0013FW05Y,"**1/2

""Drillbit Taylor"" is little more than a watered-down version of ""Superbad"" - not really a surprise since one of its writers, Seth Rogan, also had a hand in crafting that earlier, much more sophisticated work.  Yet, ironically, Rogan may actually have become a victim of his own success, for, since its release in 2007, ""Superbad"" has become the gold standard against which all subsequent revenge-of-the-nerds comic fantasies must now be measured - and ""Drillbit Taylor"" falls far short of the mark.

Nate Hartley, Troy Gentile and David Dorfman play a trio of 9th graders so terminally nerdy that they make the geeks in ""Superbad"" look like letter-wearing party animals in comparison.  After suffering endless humiliations at the hands of the school's uber bully (Alex Frost) and his simpleton sidekick (Josh Peck), the boys decide it's time to hire a professional bodyguard to teach the jerks a lesson.  They alight on one Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), a homeless ne'er-do-well who signs on for the assignment for a nominal fee - or so the boys think.

Far more dunderheaded than it is satirical, ""Drillbit Taylor"" boasts a few good laughs that don't quite compensate for the movie's predictable storyline or its frequent lapses into ""feel-good"" sentimentality.  However, the performers are generally likable, and at least the hordes of extras milling around in the background look like they might actually BE high school students for a change - not the collection of superannuated adolescents that generally populate modern teen flicks.  It's a minor triumph to be sure, but a triumph nonetheless.",1247270400,2,1607,5.177606177606178

3106953,3,B0013FW05Y,"I was really looking forward to this movie as I'm usually a fan of Owen Wilson, but I have to say this one was a bit dull.  If I had to guess, I'd say the potential humor was toned back to get a PG-13 rating.

On the plus side there are some funny parts such as the body guard interviews, the training sequences, and Owen Wilson as a gym teacher.  There was a lot of room to expand these parts and make the movie funnier.

On the negative I think the whole robbery aspect detracted from the film.  It didn't add much to your opinion of Owen's character, and the scenes with the other homeless guys were rather pointless.

All in all I think there are much better Owen Wilson movies (Wedding Crashers, anything with Ben Stiller) and better high school movies, this one didn't stand out.",1223683200,6,785,4.3061224489795915

Ryan and Wade, T-Dog and Skeletor, respectively, are polar opposites in outward appearance.  One fat, one skinny, they are the Laurel and Hardy of adolescence.  Wearing the same shirt on the first day of school only made it worse.

Insert a homeless hustler named Drillbit Taylor (Wilson) who replies to the kids' online ad for a bodyguard.  Seeing as how Taylor will work for fractions of actual qualified bodyguards, he gets the job.  Of course, by work I mean ""take the kids' money"".  And by take their money, I mean ""take their money, rob their home, sell their goods, and impersonate a teacher at their school"".  What ensues is a confrontation between the school bullies and the bum, a knock-down, drag-out struggle for supremacy and high school survival.

With enough laugh out loud moments (especially the self defense scenes) and ridiculous situations (the rap battle had me in stitches) to last from beginning to end, Drillbit Taylor is a solid addition to modern comedy, and a perfect showcase for young comedic talent.  Sure, it's a bit crass, but if you enjoyed any of the recent similar comedies (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Old-School/dp/B00005JM1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Old School</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>, Superbad,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers/dp/B000BSM26G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers</a>), you'll end up adding this to your collection.",1220054400,,2385,6.993265993265993

I found it mildly amusing, but when it gets right down to it, it wasn't anything to text home about. A homeless man is hired by three kids to keep the bullies off their backs. He proceeds to rob them by pretending to need supplies. This is of course in addition to the money they have paid him. Anyone that thinks this is funny is hurting for jokes. At any rate there are some funny parts like when Drillbit tries to teach them to fight. That and the scene where they practice their moves being tough without Drillbit near the end.

Eventually Drillbit becomes attached to the kids and gets back the stuff his homeless buddies stole from one of the kids parents. The ending is pretty decent. Although most of the family will enjoy this you will definitely be having discussions about right and wrong. The kid's parents taking the word of one of the bullies over theirs is pretty sad and doesn't add anything to the plot in my book. Not to mention I find it way hard to believe out of 5 parents none would believe their kid. Okay there is stretching things for comedy and fiction, and then there is going so far outside reality it goes beyond believable and hence funny or drama. Good quality DVD with limited replayability.

This is a funny movie ""Sometimes you have to throw some Mexican Judo in there as in ju don't know who you're messin' with holmes,"" come on that is a funny joke and the fact that Drillbit doesn't like confrontation and he was an army desserter because he was basically a wimp is pretty funny considering until that point he really didn't know how to fight at all and then at the end he opens up a serious can is pretty awesome. It's not a great comedy but for the insane geeky parts it has all the charm of Superbad and Knocked Up.

This movie isn't that bad. It has it's moments like all other comedies do and it has it's hit and misses and ALL other comedies do but that shouldn't discourage anybody from watching this movie which to me was not a waste of time whatsoever.",1216598400,,813,4.245161290322581

Too scared and too weak to fight back, they post an online ad for a bodyguard and along comes Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson) to answer their prayers.

Owen Wilson being the big name star he is, was the star power for this film.  He did have a few funny parts, but it was the kids who played the three high school geeks that stole the show.  More specifically Troy Gentile who played the chubby, hip-hop loving Ryan a.k.a. T-Dog.  For a 14 year old kid, he's got some talent, giving an incredibly funny performance.  Watch for the freestyle rap battle scene.

What brought me to giving this movie a 5 star review is the fact that Owen Wilson (a decorated comedian) and a bunch of inexperienced kids had such great on screen chemistry.  I believed everything I saw all the way down to the oblivious principal and slap happy parents.  This was an enjoyable experience that is worth the purchase.",1215475200,3,490,4.362637362637362

well, my fav part was when Owen ( Drillbit)  told the kids to find a common ground with the bullies. So the fat kid had a free-style (rap) competition with the main bully. Except he only made the bullies more furious and embarassed them.

3106977,3,B0013FW05Y,"This film shows what happens when a Hollywood team gets just a bit too much credit for some of their productions... (they go on to show that their earlier work was perhaps a lucky strike).  I could definitely see Apatow's fingerprints on this, and it had the usual cast of characters for one of his films, but I'm really finding his stuff isn't as funny as some give it credit for.  Yes Knocked Up was entertaining (and grew on me over time really), but over time Apatow and friends keep going back to the same formula and format and unfortunately they seem to keep forgetting to include humor or other compelling reasons to keep watching.

Owen Wilson plays a homeless individual that gets hired as a bodyguard for a group of picked-on high school freshmen.  Unfortunately his skills as a bodyguard are pretty much non-existent.  The kids go along with his unusual methods as they assume he's trying to teach them how to take care of themselves, but in the end the inevitable big fight between the kids and the bully they needed defense against remains their destiny.

Wilson does ok with what he's asked to do here and over the course of the film he seems to grow into an almost responsible individual.  Unfortunately the film doesn't seem to grow in the same way and viewers are left wishing for something better.

Worth a rental at best, but borderline skip it material in my book. It was ok over all, but there were parts that drug along and just weren't that funny or even that entertaining to me.

3106979,1,B0013FW05Y,"Drillbit Taylor is like someone's idea of taking some of the worst Saturday Night Live skits that were rejected by Lorne Michaels and thrown into a screenplay and filmed on location with a substantial budget. Owen Wilson's face plastered on the cover is the obvious hook of this nightmare, but even he can't save it from itself or protect it from its own mediocrity. The movie is destined to be very quickly forgotten.

Hollywood must be really desperate for new and well-written material if the financial backers of films like this, believe for a moment that any of this was entertaining, comedic or in anyway interesting. Even the youtube generation of viewers didn't care for this nasty waste of time either. Drillbit Taylor is even devoid of a redeeming social message, which the other reviews have all touched on quite intensely.

But for the record, Drillbit Taylor is another poorly written, poorly conceived idea from the mind that brought you&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad/dp/B000WZEZGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad</a>, a different movie that, sold and grossed reasonably well and re-couped their production budget which most-likely put the green-light on this.

Both of these movies don't really tell stories as much as they just play on the stereotypes within the genre.

None of it works, most of it looks really uncomfortable and people are probably just out of frame holding a light, a boom or a make-up bag thinking: Hollywood may have just jumped the shark with this.

There's currently a lot of thought and concern floating around Los Angeles lately regarding the amount of garbage that studios are pushing from the Independent Film/Movie world into the mainstream, by over-hyping, over-marketing and struggling to get A-listers like Owen Wilson into and out on to DVD -- believing that they'll make a killing, and pick up an Oscar nom in the process. If there really is a drought of good film and good writing right now, and we've slipped back into an era of forgettable movie making for the next five years, then at least consider this before you shell out the twenty bucks for the DVD as you'll probably just shed it from your collection later, when movies go back to being films.

Pick up one of the films I've mentioned above if you haven't seen any/some of them -- first. You'll be happier that you did, as all of them are real classics and good examples of the genre. Hiding Out is a true masterpiece that deals with High School, properly.",1213747200,5,3492,6.312368972746331
3340731,2,B0013FW05Y,"Wade and Ryan are just two kids getting ready to go their first day of High School. Their about to go through 4 of the best years of their life. Well, at least until day 1 starts. That's when Wade and Ryan see another freshman getting stuffed into a locker by 2 high school bullies. Wade, to Ryan's displeasure, decides to step in and stop what is going on. And so begins their days of being brutally picked on. It doesn't help that Wade is as skinny as a toothpick, Ryan is short and fat, and Emmit, the kid they `rescued', is about 4 feet tall and befriends them like a parasite even though Ryan doesn't want to be friends with him. Thanks to Wade, the three of them are constantly picked on and bullied around by the 2 high school bullies and there is nothing they can do about it. They even go to the principal to complain, but the principal doesn't believe it or doesn't care (couldn't figure it out) cause the bully is such a nice and polite kid in front of parents. So they take matters in to their own hands and hire a bodyguard to protect them. And in walks Owen Wilson as Drillbit Taylor. Drillbit is a homeless ex Army Ranger. He decides to work for the kids, but really he's just going to rob them blind. He just wants to leave and go to Canada, but needs to `earn' the money for the plane ticket.

The story is pretty 1-2-3 with some comedy thrown in. If I say this is a `typical' Hollywood movie, then I'm pretty sure you can guess how the rest of the story is going to go, and trust me when I say it does.

Now I'm sure you are saying, ""Yeah, but at least it's funny. It's got Owen Wilson"". Well first off, if you've seen an Owen Wilson comedy movie, then you've really seen them all. He barely changes. His comedy is the same all the time. He might be louder sometimes than others, but his delivery is the same. I'm not saying he's a terrible actor, I'm just saying his funny side is always the same (which can be bad or good depending on the viewer). Secondly, some of the story was just way too out there. For instance, we have a homeless guy, who puts on a suit, and then somehow tricks a school into letting him be a teacher. Classroom AND Gym teacher. All because he's holding a coffee mug...*being rolling eyes...now*. I honestly and truly didn't find myself laughing at this except for one scene and that was when Wade and Ryan decided to learn to take a punch. They just start hitting each other as hard as they can in all types of body parts and hearing each of them scream after each hit had me laughing pretty hard. Wade has the pre-maturist man scream ever. The half scream, half cry was so funny. But other than that, there wasn't a lot going for it. Parts of the story were so hard to believe like the teacher part mentioned above and then there was a part with ALL the parents confronting the principal and the bully, yet the parents all thought the bully was a good kid and that their own children were just over reacting. Yeah right. I think my Mom woulda slapped the crap out of anyone if they had messed with me like that kid was messing with them.

Being rated PG-13 I think helps a lot since since I think the movie would work well for kids still in middle school. Maybe they would find more humor and story in it than I did.",1210032000,8,3262,4.207667731629393

3340733,4,B0013FW05Y,"Wade (Hartley), Ryan (Gentile), and Emmitt (Dorfman) are three nerdy kids in need of protection.  School bully Filkins (Frost) has decided to make their lives a living hell.  After about a week of dealing with this, they decide to hire a bodyguard.  Constrained by money, they opt for Drillbit Taylor (Wilson), an ex-military man who is currently homeless and trying to make enough money to get to Canada.  Drillbit is less than impressive though, and has to come up with a plan quickly if he wants to help the kids and himself as well.

""Drillbit Taylor"" fits the mold of the Judd Apatow-produced films, albeit in PG-13 form.  Think of it as Judd Apatow-light, and that is fine because he knows what makes good movies.  Sweetness, likeable characters, and raunchy comedy make up the mix, and for ""Drillbit Taylor"", the raunchiness is toned back to give it a PG-13 rating.  Wilson is very good as Drillbit, a con-man of sorts that really isn't that good at things.  ""Drillbit Taylor"" is an amusing addition to the Apatow family of films.",1207267200,12,1037,4.748603351955308
3340734,3,B0013FW05Y,"Drillbit Taylor makes quite an accomplishment in that it is a PG-13-rated film that has the feel of last year's R-rated Superbad. Most of the vulgarity that made Apatow's previous venture inappropriately hilarious has absconded to unknown horizons, and Drillbit is left with utilizing more crafty means at achieving laughs. Not necessarily more intelligent, but certainly less crude, the similarly hilarious lead characters all find their perfect places in this consistently amusing comedy.

Three kids experience bullying at school by antagonizer Filkins, an emancipated student who revels in terrorizing smaller kids. On their first day at high school, Wade (Nate Hartley as the Harry-Potter-like scrawny kid), Ryan (Troy Gentile as the overweight kid with the never-ending ranting) and Emmit (David Dorfman as the kid-who-gets-shoved-in-a-locker) can't seem to evade constant humiliation at the hands of nemesis Filkins. Only able to take so much, the three decide to hire a bodyguard to defend them. In a riotous job-interview montage, the trio chooses Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), an ex-black-ops and improvised weapons expert, who teaches them to stick up for themselves. During the process, Drillbit gets sidetracked with aggressive teacher Lisa (Leslie Mann) and the truth that he is nothing more than a homeless bum who yearns for the good life in Canada.

Drillbit Taylor, like Superbad, derives much of its humorous moments by forcing many continual little laughs. Quick jokes follow rapid slapstick to allow the audience to pick and choose what tickles their funny-bones. When some gags don't work, instant new ribs replace them so that no one can sit still for long. But most unique is the idea that the majority of the humor does not rely on crudeness, but the friendlier grounds of physical comedy (undergoing torment by bullies) and unexpectedly nonsensical dialogue (the love chatter between Drillbit and Lisa).

Again this comedy falls into the same storyline quicksand that plagues most recent comedies, which is allowing the conflict to become too serious. No one doubts the fact that the plot is absolutely ridiculous and that most of the concepts are exaggerated to the point of absurdity, but within this fantasy world of nerds and bullies, some things we hope to remain realistic. Things like vengeance against the bullies, getting the girls, and staying out of serious harm's way. These concepts are approached with little justice to realism, and so results in a conclusion that can only be as unlikely as the samurai-sword-wielding antagonist. That's not to say that any of it was intended to be faithful to the stereotypical perception of high school life, but most of it appears that way from the get-go.

""As long as you have a coffee cup in your hand, nobody says nothing,"" explains Drillbit, on his ease at infiltrating the school as a substitute teacher. And so as long as the humor remains appealingly gut-busting, no one questions the reasoning behind much of the juvenile antics. Where Superbad focused on nonstop sexual and gross-out humor, Drillbit stays refreshingly clean with its parody of the cool kids and the un-cool kids frequenting a typical high school. And (comedic) revenge against persecution is one of the most universally inviting themes to watch.

3340735,2,B0013FW05Y,"Movies like ""Drillbit Taylor"" really make me mad; they feature teenage characters that are absolutely nothing like real teenagers, and they tell stories that are far too serious for light-hearted comedies. They're not relatable and they're not funny, certainly not to anyone who can actually remember being a teenager. I understand that ""Drillbit Taylor"" wants to be a farce, but it completely fails because it spoofs a teenage world that was already a spoof to begin with. In other words, this movie makes fun of a life that doesn't exist. It doesn't help that the story is just plain ridiculous, amounting to nothing more than an excuse for teens to be foul-mouthed and violent. If you actually find that sophomoric sense of humor funny, then feel free to stop reading this in favor of someone else's positive review.

The film begins with two friends talking on the phone the night before the first day of high school--the tall and lanky Wade (Nate Hartley) and the short and fat Ryan (Troy Gentile), who likes rap and prefers the nickname T Dog. When the big day comes, absolutely nothing goes right: not only do they unintentionally wear the same shirt, Wade also intervenes on behalf of an uncool nerd named Jim (Ian Roberts), who's being tortured by the school bully, Filkins (Alex Cross). Now with both a powerful enemy and an unwanted friend, Wade and Ryan endure hell for the first week of school, from getting locked in the trophy display to being forced to share the same shirt at the same time. What's worse is that absolutely no one offers to help them. Considering the number of students who witness this abuse happening in broad daylight, it's disgusting that not a single one would say something to someone.

When the bullied boys reach their breaking point, they place an online want ad for a bodyguard. After screening a number of possible candidates, they meet Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), who impresses them so much that they immediately hire him. Forget about the fact that he looks, sounds, and behaves nothing like an authentic bodyguard, and let's just focus on his back-story for a minute--he's a homeless AWOL military officer who sees the boys' situation as a way to make money. Under the guise of being their bodyguard, he plans to rob them blind and use their money to run away to Canada. A loser conning adults is one thing, but a loser conning teens is just plain wrong; even if that does happen in real life--and I'm sure it does--it's not something that a movie should make light of.

In realizing he can't immediately take the money and run, Taylor wings his way through a makeshift training program, which is so pathetic it's a wonder they didn't catch onto his scheme sooner. The time eventually comes for Taylor to pose as one of the school's teachers, and amazingly, the staff accepts him on the spot. This is especially true of the English teacher, Lisa (Leslie Mann), who lusts after Taylor pretty much the instant she meets him in the teacher's lounge. Why she feels this way, I have no idea; she says she has a self-destructive tendency to gravitate towards losers and bums, but even then, it's hard to imagine why she acts the way she does. I was actually scared of this woman--she jumps onto Taylor and has sex with him so frequently that she seemed more like a stalker instead of a lover.

Eventually comes the climactic moment when Wade challenges Filkins to a fight. Without Taylor's help (for reasons I won't reveal), Wade and Ryan train each other how to take physical pain, and of course, it ends with both boys cupping their genitals in agony. At the very least, that scene was just being goofy, meaning it was a little funny. The same can't be said for the final fight between them and Filkins. This isn't a case of three boys engaging in a comedic fistfight; two minors and a psychotic eighteen-year-old are violent at a level you wouldn't even see on YouTube. They use telephones and lamps to bash each other over the head. They kick each other into furniture and handrails. Even a samurai sword gets involved, resulting in someone losing a finger.

What part of this sounds entertaining? What part of this sounds funny? To anyone who feels that I'm being overly harsh and just need to lighten up, let me reassure you that even I like to laugh from time to time. Actually, I love to laugh, pretty much like everyone else. But good grief, the line has to be drawn somewhere; teen comedies in and of themselves are fine, but if you see the humor in placing a severed finger in a cocktail to keep it sterile, I'm afraid you've lost me. ""Drillbit Taylor"" is like an arrogant comedian, thinking it's much funnier than it actually is, sinking down low in a desperate attempt for a laugh. Its portrayal of teens is sad, not only because it's so over the top, but also because, even if these characters existed, no one would ever want to be like them, anyway. But the title character is the worst of all--a man that uses young boys for financial gain is the stuff of drama, not comedy.

With the frosh high schoolers it was stealing property from Ryan's parents' house.  Then too there is the organization of ""schools"" to provide access for homosexist criminal assaults under such euphemisms as ""physical education"" and ""sports fan"" judges requiring convicted criminal players violent outside their homosexual dominance rituals to do the ""public service"" of urging fed up young people to ""stay in school"" so that their wannabe criminal thugs have bodies to brutalize.

3341328,3,B0013FW05Y,"Drillbit Taylor

 This light comedy about high school boys stars Owen Wilson.  In the tradition of John Wayne, Wilson always seems to play Wilson in every one of his movies.  People who like him, which is nearly everybody so far as I can tell, don't seem to mind.  I don't mind, but it is acting of a certain kind.  He is funny and charming always, it is the same in this one.
 Wilson plays a down and out army deserter who lives in the brush in what looks like Santa Monica.  Three high school freshmen hire him to protect them from a psychopathic senior class bully.  As it happens, Drillbit Taylor, the bodyguard, has issues about personal confrontation and indeed about violence in general.
 There were several good laughs during the movie, but no real side splitters.  There is a superfluous romantic attachment between Owen Wilson and Leslie Mann.  The boys are awkward, geeky, earnest and endearing which is a plus.  The script is much less filled with foulness and bad language than other recent offerings in the genre, which is a plus as far as I am concerned.  The same team produced last years potty mouthed Super Bad.  They dialed back the nastiness several degrees for this one.
 This light hearted comedy is light in all respects.  It is rated PG and runs for one hour and 42 minutes.  I can muster only two and a half saw blades for the thin and unremarkable Drillbit Taylor.  There is only one brief smooch and no nudity.",1472342400,,1437,4.54296875

When you buy a blu ray you want basically two things: 1. high quality gorgeous picture; 2. great audio. This blu ray has both, so it's worth grabbing the blu ray over the dvd if you have a HD tv and surround sound speaker system and want to get the most out of them.",1366675200,,412,3.963855421686747
3341420,2,B0013FW05Y,"First off I bought this Blu-ray for like a buck, so how could I go wrong.  Even with shipping it was like $4.  In the end, however, I still felt slightly ripped off.  Not sure what Owen Wilson was thinking after making such great movies as The Royal Tannenbaums and The Life Aquatic, hell even Wedding Crashers, but perhaps he didn't even read the script before signing on.  Here you have a group of misfit kids starting high school.  You have the shy skinny geek and the fat outlandish geek and they wind up teaming up with the spastic incoherent geek and there off.  Day one and they make the acquaintance of the school bully and his toady (Josh from Drake & Josh no less)and the beatings, pantsings, and arbitrary humiliations begin.  Tired of the same thing every day, our three geeky heroes decide to hire a bodyguard. Enter Drillbit Taylor (Wilson) a homeless layabout who needs to earn some cash to make his way to Canada where he believes the good life is.  The geek squad hires Drillbit thinking that he is some ex-paramilitary killing machine and all their problems with the bully will be over.  No. Drillbit is just a jerk and he's totally afraid of violence. He's there for the money.  You can see where this is going, right?

Seriously, the premise here has been used so many times that even to mock it would be a waste of time.  The kids are charming and funny and pathetic and that makes you remember how you were when high school was the scariest place on earth.  But the bully is over 18 and emancipated and some of the things he does to the three are so outrageous as to require jail time.  So in the end, the movie just comes off as irritating. Wilson looks bored here, as if he can't even believe he's a part of this train wreck.  Perhaps he was drunk when he signed the contract? Or owed someone a huge favor? Who knows.  In the end, if you find yourself watching Drillbit Taylor, hopefully you only NetFlixed it. Look on in horror and smile maybe once, then flush it from your mind with anything else.",1366588800,,2023,4.412398921832884

3341431,2,B0013FW05Y,"Taken on its own, Drillbit Taylor is a film that's too grounded in reality to be that funny. Considering the pedigree involved in writing the project, add the phrase ""Exceedingly disappointing"" to it also. You see, John Hughes came up with the story, and Seth Rogan co-wrote the screenplay. No, this isn't an Ethan Cohen vs. Etan Cohen situation here, these are the John Hughes & Seth Rogan that you know and love. So how did this film go so wrong?

First off, the story. The plot revolves around three bullied kids hiring a bodyguard to protect them, except the bodyguard is actually a homeless person, and doesn't really have any credentials to be bodyguarding. Sound familiar? It should. The plot derives cliches from every bully plot or sub-plot in movie history, every character pretending who they're not, then being found out plot or sub-plot you've ever seen, and a myriad of other random high school cliches. And since the script was co-written by Seth Rogan, who also did Superbad, you can derive a dozen similarities to that movie as well. In fact, in that respect, Drillbit Taylor seems like the prequel to Superbad. There's the tall, geeky kid that has trouble with the ladies. There's his smart-mouthed friend, who also happens to be chubby. And they even have their third member, who isn't really a core member, but can be helpful/crazy when you need him to be. But Michael Cera, Jonah Hill & Christopher Mintz-Plasse these kids aren't. They're bad actors, and they sell little if anything about their characters. The adults are good actors, but with the exception of Owen Wilson and maybe Danny McBride, everybody is reduced to little more than cartoon characters. In one scene, the bully charms all the parents and the school principal with a stupid joke and a smile, and everybody acts like he was Jesus Christ. Granted, this fits into the cliche in these films that adults are stupid and you must take it upon yourself to stand up for yourself, but that's Home Alone logic. And at least in that film, the adults weren't total buffoons.

But that being said, the highlight of the film, and the only real reason you should think about watching this film is Owen Wilson. Wilson brings a certain charm to the character and makes the most out of a poorly-written character that's story-arch is a little bit non-existent. Wilson's character starts off as a greedy jerk, then turns into a nice guy, with the implication of one scene being the only explained reason. Then there's the fact that Drillbit can't really fight, then turns into a kicking bad-ass in the one ending scene that makes of the film's DVD cover.

Which brings me to this: The film isn't that funny. There's some gags that work, and the charms of a few of the actors make jokes more funny than they really are, but there simply isn't much here to laugh at. This is mainly due to the fact that there's little place for true humor in the story. Why? Because the bully is an unrelenting and dangerous psychopath that threatens people and commits bodily harm to them with a freakin' samurai sword. Thus, the confrontational scenes are utterly brutal to watch. It's like watching a mouse crawling into a lion's cage. You admire its perseverance, but you known that the Lion has the ability and the desire to shred such a cute thing. It's not funny, it's just uncomfortable and scary. The story tries to add humor around these situations, but every one of them falls flat. Especially the ones that involve topics such as balls. Oh, and if you've ever had past experience, or have been traumatized by a bully, you'll be traumatized by watching this film. I felt traumatized and I haven't even been in that situation.

Overall, if you're a HUGE Owen Wilson fan, then check out this movie, and you'll find something you like. Otherwise, skip it like it's a fat girl at the prom dance. There's not much to like, there's not much to think about, there's not that much to laugh at, and in the end, you just feel bad.",1283731200,5,3985,4.680456490727532

Nice movie with some funny scenes. The funniest scenes are the ones where the students were bullied around. The craziest things were done to them.

This movie kinda reminded me of the high school I went to. We didn't have nasty bullies like the ones in this movie, however we had some bullies that needed some butt wooping in order to behave well.

""Drillbit Taylor"" is little more than a watered-down version of ""Superbad"" - not really a surprise since one of its writers, Seth Rogan, also had a hand in crafting that earlier, much more sophisticated work.  Yet, ironically, Rogan may actually have become a victim of his own success, for, since its release in 2007, ""Superbad"" has become the gold standard against which all subsequent revenge-of-the-nerds comic fantasies must now be measured - and ""Drillbit Taylor"" falls far short of the mark.

Nate Hartley, Troy Gentile and David Dorfman play a trio of 9th graders so terminally nerdy that they make the geeks in ""Superbad"" look like letter-wearing party animals in comparison.  After suffering endless humiliations at the hands of the school's uber bully (Alex Frost) and his simpleton sidekick (Josh Peck), the boys decide it's time to hire a professional bodyguard to teach the jerks a lesson.  They alight on one Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), a homeless ne'er-do-well who signs on for the assignment for a nominal fee - or so the boys think.

Far more dunderheaded than it is satirical, ""Drillbit Taylor"" boasts a few good laughs that don't quite compensate for the movie's predictable storyline or its frequent lapses into ""feel-good"" sentimentality.  However, the performers are generally likable, and at least the hordes of extras milling around in the background look like they might actually BE high school students for a change - not the collection of superannuated adolescents that generally populate modern teen flicks.  It's a minor triumph to be sure, but a triumph nonetheless.",1247270400,2,1607,5.177606177606178

3341450,3,B0013FW05Y,"I was really looking forward to this movie as I'm usually a fan of Owen Wilson, but I have to say this one was a bit dull.  If I had to guess, I'd say the potential humor was toned back to get a PG-13 rating.

On the plus side there are some funny parts such as the body guard interviews, the training sequences, and Owen Wilson as a gym teacher.  There was a lot of room to expand these parts and make the movie funnier.

On the negative I think the whole robbery aspect detracted from the film.  It didn't add much to your opinion of Owen's character, and the scenes with the other homeless guys were rather pointless.

All in all I think there are much better Owen Wilson movies (Wedding Crashers, anything with Ben Stiller) and better high school movies, this one didn't stand out.",1223683200,6,785,4.3061224489795915

This wasn't really a laugh out loud movie and I didn't expected it to be. But it turned out to be a good movie to watch.

3341454,4,B0013FW05Y,"Two socially awkward nerds and a tag along embarking on the freshman year of their high school career are inevitable targets for bullying.  Ryan and Wade, T-Dog and Skeletor, respectively, are polar opposites in outward appearance.  One fat, one skinny, they are the Laurel and Hardy of adolescence.  Wearing the same shirt on the first day of school only made it worse.

Insert a homeless hustler named Drillbit Taylor (Wilson) who replies to the kids' online ad for a bodyguard.  Seeing as how Taylor will work for fractions of actual qualified bodyguards, he gets the job.  Of course, by work I mean ""take the kids' money"".  And by take their money, I mean ""take their money, rob their home, sell their goods, and impersonate a teacher at their school"".  What ensues is a confrontation between the school bullies and the bum, a knock-down, drag-out struggle for supremacy and high school survival.

With enough laugh out loud moments (especially the self defense scenes) and ridiculous situations (the rap battle had me in stitches) to last from beginning to end, Drillbit Taylor is a solid addition to modern comedy, and a perfect showcase for young comedic talent.  Sure, it's a bit crass, but if you enjoyed any of the recent similar comedies (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Old-School/dp/B00005JM1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Old School</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>, Superbad,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers/dp/B000BSM26G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers</a>), you'll end up adding this to your collection.",1220054400,,2385,6.993265993265993

I found it mildly amusing, but when it gets right down to it, it wasn't anything to text home about. A homeless man is hired by three kids to keep the bullies off their backs. He proceeds to rob them by pretending to need supplies. This is of course in addition to the money they have paid him. Anyone that thinks this is funny is hurting for jokes. At any rate there are some funny parts like when Drillbit tries to teach them to fight. That and the scene where they practice their moves being tough without Drillbit near the end.

Eventually Drillbit becomes attached to the kids and gets back the stuff his homeless buddies stole from one of the kids parents. The ending is pretty decent. Although most of the family will enjoy this you will definitely be having discussions about right and wrong. The kid's parents taking the word of one of the bullies over theirs is pretty sad and doesn't add anything to the plot in my book. Not to mention I find it way hard to believe out of 5 parents none would believe their kid. Okay there is stretching things for comedy and fiction, and then there is going so far outside reality it goes beyond believable and hence funny or drama. Good quality DVD with limited replayability.

It's not a great comedy but for the insane geeky parts it has all the charm of Superbad and Knocked Up.

This movie isn't that bad. It has it's moments like all other comedies do and it has it's hit and misses and ALL other comedies do but that shouldn't discourage anybody from watching this movie which to me was not a waste of time whatsoever.",1216598400,,813,4.245161290322581

Too scared and too weak to fight back, they post an online ad for a bodyguard and along comes Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson) to answer their prayers.

Owen Wilson being the big name star he is, was the star power for this film.  He did have a few funny parts, but it was the kids who played the three high school geeks that stole the show.  More specifically Troy Gentile who played the chubby, hip-hop loving Ryan a.k.a. T-Dog.  For a 14 year old kid, he's got some talent, giving an incredibly funny performance.  Watch for the freestyle rap battle scene.

I could definitely see Apatow's fingerprints on this, and it had the usual cast of characters for one of his films, but I'm really finding his stuff isn't as funny as some give it credit for.  Yes Knocked Up was entertaining (and grew on me over time really), but over time Apatow and friends keep going back to the same formula and format and unfortunately they seem to keep forgetting to include humor or other compelling reasons to keep watching.

Owen Wilson plays a homeless individual that gets hired as a bodyguard for a group of picked-on high school freshmen.  Unfortunately his skills as a bodyguard are pretty much non-existent.  The kids go along with his unusual methods as they assume he's trying to teach them how to take care of themselves, but in the end the inevitable big fight between the kids and the bully they needed defense against remains their destiny.

Wilson does ok with what he's asked to do here and over the course of the film he seems to grow into an almost responsible individual.  Unfortunately the film doesn't seem to grow in the same way and viewers are left wishing for something better.

The movie is destined to be very quickly forgotten.

Hollywood must be really desperate for new and well-written material if the financial backers of films like this, believe for a moment that any of this was entertaining, comedic or in anyway interesting. Even the youtube generation of viewers didn't care for this nasty waste of time either. Drillbit Taylor is even devoid of a redeeming social message, which the other reviews have all touched on quite intensely.

There's currently a lot of thought and concern floating around Los Angeles lately regarding the amount of garbage that studios are pushing from the Independent Film/Movie world into the mainstream, by over-hyping, over-marketing and struggling to get A-listers like Owen Wilson into and out on to DVD -- believing that they'll make a killing, and pick up an Oscar nom in the process. If there really is a drought of good film and good writing right now, and we've slipped back into an era of forgettable movie making for the next five years, then at least consider this before you shell out the twenty bucks for the DVD as you'll probably just shed it from your collection later, when movies go back to being films.

Pick up one of the films I've mentioned above if you haven't seen any/some of them -- first. You'll be happier that you did, as all of them are real classics and good examples of the genre. Hiding Out is a true masterpiece that deals with High School, properly.",1213747200,5,3492,6.312368972746331
8250778,4,B0013FW05Y,"Cute movie.  Well done.  It does lose steam somewhere in the middle, (I actually lost interest and turned it off for a while) but the ending is good.  This is probably one of  the characters (if not the) that suits Owen Wilson best and the 3 lead child actors are terrific.",1525996800,,273,4.294117647058823
