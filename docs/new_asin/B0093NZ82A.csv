8535274,5,B0093NZ82A,"I really wanted to own this drama, but I couldn't locate a Region 3 release with English subtitles.  My next hope was buying a version licensed outside Korean.  These DVD's are released for the Singaporean market.  They come with English and Chinese subtitles.  You pick which subtitles will be displayed, they are not displayed at the same time.

I wasn't sure what quality to expect from Singaporean English subtitles, however I was pleasantly surprised.  I believe the subtitles are quite good.  All the English is well translated and, in my perspective, retains the depth of the original language faithfully enough.  I really like how some words are left untranslated such as ""Hyung, Oppa, Unni, Ajeosshi, etc.""  As these words have no faithful English equivalent I really prefer for them to be left untranslated.  Anyone that watches Korean dramas knows these words by heart, and when they are translated I find it really detracts from the experience of watching a Korean drama.

I do have two criticisms.  Sometimes the subtitles are not timed correctly.  A line on occasion will flash on the screen two quickly to read.  This is rare and not a major hindrance to enjoying the drama.  Second, the sentences are often divided in awkward places from one line of text to the next.  Sentences are needlessly split up in odd ways that sometimes make reading them strangely halting.  Once again, this is a fairly minor issue.

Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase.  I ordered mine from timothyng001 and was very pleased with both the service, shipping time, and feedback to my questions about the DVD set.  I would recommend the seller.",1363478400,7,1643,4.905454545454545
