8260681,5,B00161H5CS,"THE ALAMO is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. THE ALAMO is one of our nation's greatest cinematic icons of ""Film Americana"" ever made. Through word, song and picture the legend of the Alamo was handed down and stills lives today. Men and women of different religious, ethnic and social backgrounds came together and died or lost loved ones at the Alamo in a noble effort to overcome tyranny and preserve basic human freedoms. John Wayne preserved that legend on film. John Wayne produced, directed and starred in this epic mixing nobility with bawdiness resulting in a reverence for the ideals of the defenders seen through their personal lives and conduct. The cast, script, production design and score added to the richly textured look and feel to the film. John Wayne is effective in his portrayal of Col. David Crockett. However, John Wayne takes a back seat to the brilliant performances of Laurence Harvey as Col. William Travis and Richard Widmark as Col. James Bowie as they feud and bicker over the virtues of military protocol vs. military expedience. Wayne in turn approaches the role of Crockett as the levelheaded onlooker who interjects this legend with passages of homespun witticism to keep the defenders from losing focus of their reason for being there. Cinematographer William Clothier's images are proud and majestic depicting the honor of the defenders. James Edward Grant's script is intelligent, energetic and moving. Equally energetic and moving is the eloquent and multi-textured score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Tiomkin's scoring of the final battle scene is brilliant and highly overlooked. Tiomkin integrates the nobility of the combatants with the fervor of the conflict and with simple queues he emotionally captures the falling of each defender in a brief moment of reflection as the battle rages on. His song ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" is beautiful, reflective and haunting and is effectively integrated into the context of why the defenders gave their lives. THE ALAMO thanks to John Wayne's determination and insight to what drives the American spirit. IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is groundbreaking in its own right. Sidney Poitier's Detective Virgil Tibbs and Rod Steiger's Sheriff Gillespie seem like men joined together by fate in a setting where they are only exist to get a job done, to see right done over wrong. These two men are inexorably tied by some greater notion that color does not really matter, yet they were inexorably different cast into this world by their cultural differences. That is what makes this film so great. Norman Jewison is a brilliant director. He first and foremost knows how to tackle a story thematically and at the same time entertain you. He is a master storyteller where every element of a film is somehow integrated into an all encompassing single tale touching all our senses in the process. As for Sidney Poitier, this is his film . He is Mister Tibbs, the inimitable Mister Tibbs. I love THE BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ' resolute perseverance for truth, the main characters' quest for knowledge and the purpose of his existence. The acting is first-rate. I saw this film when it was first released and I have never forgotten it. It was somewhat devastating. John Frankenheimer's films have that effect on you. It is a good one and I liked it then and I still like it now. This film consists of great character studies and the eternal question of why was man put on this earth. For what purpose? It has stood the test of time. Burt Lancaster's performance was brilliant, very underplayed and yet very focused. I also liked Elmer Bernstein's sensitive and thought provoking score. It fit the concrete landscape juxtaposed by the wonderment of the freedom to fly like a bird and behold the beauty that is in this world. Elmer Bernstein's early scores were very sensitive and often overlooked. THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is director John Frankenheimer's definitive film. The mesmerizing story of a political and psychological subterfuge is devastating. This film is distinctly a John Frankenheimer film and I believe his best. One thing that strikes time and again when I think of this film is Laurence Harvey's performance as Raymond Shaw. Could a figure be more tragic, so torn apart and put back together? Could a character be so devastated and tossed away like a lump of flesh to be used for some inhumane political ambition? I think not. And what of Frank Sinatra's performance as Major Marco? He too is a pawn in the threatening dark forces whose political point of view is one that would subjugate all for the greater good of mankind. Major Marco's heartbreak is that he has uncovered part of their scheme and he knows that Raymond Shaw too is a pawn, but to what purpose? This is one of Frank Sinatra's finest performances (he has always been underrated as an actor in my opinion) as is Laurence Harvey's (also underrated and somewhat forgotten). These two strong performances make this film or the more real, all the more horrifying. Behind it all is David Amram's score that is so prophetically apt. There is such a tragedy at work here. What happens in the name of freedom, not only for American values, but the values of the free world is solemnly told here by John Frankenheimer.",1381536000,,5259,4.896860986547085
8260682,5,B00161H5CS,"This 3rd United Artist Cinema Greats collection was great. the sound and picture were great. The Alamo and In The heat of the Night were in color. The Manchurian Candidate and Birdman From Alcatraz were in B/W. Being in B/W did not detract from the movie.

They did it right with four DVDs each in their separate jewel boxes. All 4 DVDs played perfect with no problems.

The Alamo was my favorite. Special features include John Wayne's documentary of the Alamo and the original movie trailer. John Wayne produced, directed and stars in this DVD. One of my favorite actors and proved he could make a great movie. As an added plus the viewer learns a little US/Mexican history. the Alamo had 7 Academy award nominations. John  Wayne(as Colonel Davie Crockett),Richard Widmark(as Colonel Jim Bowie),Laurence Harvey (Commander of the Alamo ...Colonel Travis, Richard Boone ( General Sam Houston), and Frankie Avalon ( youngest kid volunteer soldier/messenger)star. JW's son Patrick Wayne and Chill Wills are in the movie.

Its 1838, before Texas became a republic and later a state,and the Mexican General/ruler of Mexico Santa Anna and his 7,000 man army is crushing any resistance and freedom in Northern Mexico/Texas. General Sam Huston promotes Major Travis to Colonel and tells him he needs time to build his army in Texas against Santa Anna. Travis takes command of a broken down church (The Alamo)near a small town. Its right in the way of Santa Anna and Gen Sam Houston's camp. Santa Anna must take the Alamo first as not to leave an enemy position in his supply lines. We see ex Tennessee Congressman/Indian/British fighter Davie Crockett and is 23 fighting men from Tennessee and Jim Bowie and his 100 volunteers and Travis's men holding up in the Alamo. What a gallant fight 185 men put up against Santa Anna's 7,000 men. The 185 men at the Alamo are slaughtered but give General Houston a precious 13 days of time for him to assemble his army. History has the men that died defending the Alamo as heroes. 5 stars plus!

The Manchurian Candidate (in B/W)is about a platoon of soldiers in 1952 Korea captured and brain washed. Frank Sinatra stars as the platoons commanding officer and later is a Major in army intelligence. He and the other men say the Sergent saved them all and wiped out a company of enemy soldiers and a machine gun nest. NOT! All brain washing. Laurence Harvey stars as false Medal of Honer winner/hero of the platoon and is brain washed by the Russians/Koreans to be an assassin when the Queen of diamonds is thrown up when he plays Solitaire. His evil mother Angela Lansbury is a enemy agent and is the trigger to make her son ( the false Medal of Honer Winner)kill the presidential candidate at a convention. NOT! What a great ending. This movie surprised me. I expected only a 3 star movie but it was excellent. 4 1/2 stars.

Birdman of Alcatraz (in B/W)is about a bad man that killed one person and a prison guard. His mother helps him get his sentence reduced by President Wilson from death to life in solitary confinement. In Leavenworth prison he meats a warden and does not break to all the Warden's rules but says he has  rights too. Eventual he saves a sparrow and later gets involved with hundreds canaries and becomes the world's expert on bird diseases even with only a third grade education. He has 52 years in prison to read and experiment. In prison he meets a woman involved with birds and they marry but he never gets out of prison and is transferred to the rock Alcatraz. No birds for him there but he writes a book on prison history life to the chagrin of the prison warden. Big riot, many prisoners killed and now almost 70 year old Birdman of Alcatraz throws out a rifle and handgun and tells the warden and riot squad and Army national guard that its OK and the prisoners have no more weapons. We see the Birdman who once was a savage killer who hated humanity, mellowed out into a gental human being. After 52 years in prison he is transferred to a minimal security prison but never is allowed to pass parole and be released. Rated 4 1/2 stars

I'm not into police glorification movies and had originally had no interest in The Heat Of The Night and did not plan to see it but I did. I was pleasantly surprised. This murder mystery won five 1967 Oscars. Starring Oscar winners Sidney Poitier (Vigil Tibbs a black Philadelphia policeman), Rod Steiger and Lee Grant. A rich man who is going to build a thousand man plant in Sparta Miss. is murdered and the bumbling city cops have no clue as to who killed him. Mr. Tibbs the black Philadelphia cop visiting his mother in Sparta is arrested as a suspect but is later let go. His Chief of police in Philly tells Tibbs to assist the Chief in Sparta to solve the murder. Tibbs is a homicide detective specialist/expert. The town has a lot of hatred for black people and there is lots of racial prejudice. Mr. Tibbs almost gets himself killed solving the murder by the town thugs who hate successful black people. Tibbs is brilliant and later the Sparta Chief and him have an understanding and almost become friends. At least the  chief shows Virgil Tibbs respect. A great ending. 4 1/2 stars.

This 4 DVd set 5 stars.",1330128000,,5214,4.614886731391586
8260683,5,B00161H5CS,"The names of these movies and the actors in them are their own best recommendations. The films star some of the most charismatic and talented figures in 60s cinema: John Wayne and Richard Widmark in ""The Alamo,"" Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger in ""In the Heat of the Night,"" Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury in ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" and Burt Lancaster, Karl Malden, and Telly Savalas in ""Birdman of Alcatraz.""

""The Alamo,"" released in 1960, is a patriotic paean to the battle all Americans are supposed to remember. It was not one of Wayne's strongest movies -- it's rather more talky than it needs to be -- but the Duke does solid work as Davy Crockett. He was producer and director of this epic western as well as leading man, and he used every lesson he learned from mentors John Ford and Howard Hawks to make the characters intriguing, the action scenes thrilling, and the cinematography magnificent.

""In the Heat of the Night"" is a showcase for brilliant acting. Poitier and Steiger, as a Philadelphia detective and a Mississippi sheriff investigating a mysterious murder, are perfect foils in this drama set in the racist South. The atmosphere is tense, and when the protagonists clash, the effect is electric. Steiger won the 1967 Best Actor Oscar for his performance, but Poitier deserved one, too, just for his reading of this pivotal line: ""My name is Mr. Tibbs!""

""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a Cold War classic from 1962. Sinatra is a major who is captured and brainwashed with his platoon during the Korean War, and Lansbury is the mother of one of his comrades, played by Laurence Harvey. She's a monstrous communist mole conspiring to have her husband, a senator, elected president, while Sinatra struggles to understand what has happened to him and stop the evil plot. By turns weirdly frightening and wickedly funny, it's a film you'll never forget. Lansbury won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.

""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (misnamed ""Birdman from Alcatraz"" on the cover of this set but nowhere else on the package) was directed by John Frankenheimer, who also made ""The Manchurian Candidate."" It's a 1962 character study of a real-life murderer, Robert Stroud, who becomes an ornithological authority in prison. Played by Burt Lancaster as a quiet, intelligent, principled rebel, the actual Stroud was, by all accounts, nothing like the film makes him out to be. It's a moving, inspiring story nonetheless, one that won Lancaster an Oscar nomination.

Please don't pay too much for this box set! It's available brand new at less than $20 from Amazon Marketplace sellers. There are no extra features on the discs save theatrical trailers, but as I've pointed out, the movies themselves are superb entertainment, and the bargain price is the frosting on the cake. There are three more four-DVD sets in this series of classics from United Artists, all of them eminently collectable.",1296864000,,2912,4.983539094650205
