The Crazy Lady of the Miracles

La loca de los milagros (1975)

I noticed at the opening credits that a few songs were by Juan Gabriel (I think ""Maana, maana"" was by him) and Facundo Cabral (Argentine singer ""No soy de aqu ni soy de all""). It seemed that the film was going to be about the contrast between youth and maturity, shown in the comparison between Libertad Lamarque (Argentine singer and actress) and the capriciousness of the annoying youth she hangs around with. They make fun of her, and even push her into a pool, and when she plays them a record of her songs (she's a singer in the film), they take it off in disgust.

Then the film becomes a hodgepodge of episodes and antics. An old business acquaintance of Aurora Durban (Libertad Lamarque) requests that she help him make some money and tour on a music show. At first she refuses, but then agrees. Most of the annoying youth she hangs around with join her on the tour. It seems they are also entertainers. One of the females, who is jealous of her, attempts to sabotage her singing, but Aurora Durban (Libertad Lamarque) is saved by Vicente Fernandez (Mexican singer),(playing himself) and they do a mariachi number. There's also a clown entertainer, who's a drunk, who has a kid and performs with him.  The female who is jealous of Aurora Durban (Libertad Lamarque) even plays a crazy violin number, doing a classic Mexican melody.

""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"" (a song by Dawn featuring Tony Orlando) was mouthed at a poolside scene.  It's just very silly.

Well, as I watched the film, I wanted to get an electric hair clipper to cut all the 70's long 'guy haircuts'.  There's some fine 70's apparel on display as well.

The film isn't that great, but there's a certain vital force in it that I enjoyed. Later, we learn that Aurora Durban (Libertad Lamarque) never had a child and she longs for one. She lost her husband but imagined that she in fact had a daughter, hence, she invented her. They put her into an asylum for two years where she got the name, ""La loca de los milagros"". In one city, she finds a teenage orphan and asks her if she would like to become part of her life. It's a bit sentimental and highly unlikely, but take it for what it's worth. The film wants you to be happy.

Libertad Lamarque does the Facundo Cabral song ""No soy de aqu ni soy de all"", which is a great song. There's about six songs in the film, which keeps it going. She does a few of them, always vibrant and energetic. Towards the end, she sings the Juan Gabriel song ""Maana, maana"" and that really creates a nice mood climax.

In all, I enjoyed it for what it was, Libertad Lamarque was nearing the end of her career, but her songs were still filled with energy.

8091182,4,B000BQYX2Y,"La Loca De Los Milagros/The Crazy Lady of the Miracles(1975) is a comedy-drama starring the late, great Libertad Lamarque. She was a real professional when it came to acting and he had a strong screen presence. She started acting in Spanish language films in Argentina(her home country) in the 1930's, continued acting in Mexican movies, and she passed away while acting on a telenovela/soap opera in the year 2000. In La Loca De Los Milagros, Lamarque plays Aurora Durban, an elderly, washed up singer who comes out of retirement to join a traveling group of entertainers. She asks a teenage girl, Aurorita(Lucero Reynoso) to be her ""daughter"". However, Aurorita feels guilty about what she's doing.
 This film was directed by Jose Maria Fernandez Unsain; at the time, he was married to Mexican starlet Jacqueline Andere. This film does suffer from some Frank Capra-ish ""capracorn"" and some 70's cheese. There's a Spanish cover of Tony Orlando and Dawn's sugary sweet song 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree'. Also, a camera operator's reflection is visible near a hotel swimming pool! Still, Sergio Guerrero's music score gives this movie some heart and soul and singer/actor Vicente Fernandez makes a guest appearance. Keep an eye out for late Eduardo Lopez Rojas. He was in My Family(1995) with Esai Morales and Jimmy Smits. A young, sexy Olga Breeskin co-stars in the film. She's famous for her prowess as a violin player. La Loca de Los Milagros is a solid film from the late Libertad Lamarque.",1254009600,6,1509,4.9644268774703555
