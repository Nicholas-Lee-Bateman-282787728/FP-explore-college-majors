4862195,3,B005S0STVO,Good in theory but baby is probably better to work with before they are moving a whole lot. Good video though for yourself.,1353456000,2,123,4.391304347826087
4862196,3,B005S0STVO,I like the dvd but I was wanted something that had more mom and baby moves other then just touching. It is not the worst one I have seen but i figured it would have stuff for bigger kids and mom.,1349481600,3,195,3.7804878048780486
4862197,5,B005S0STVO,I bought this for my daughter-in-law and she already had one. She loves  it! So I ended up given it to a new mom with a colic baby and it has made a huge difference.,1349308800,2,165,3.7142857142857144
4862198,3,B005S0STVO,"This video was not that interactive with baby, and it isn't as challenging as I had hoped. I was sore the next day which was nice, but I think I'll buy one that isn't mama and baby so it will be more challenging.",1346976000,,212,3.953488372093023
4862199,5,B005S0STVO,I loved this DVD. It was a great way for me to bond with my babyy while doing the yoga that i so enjoyed before i was pregnant with him!,1332806400,3,136,3.566666666666667
4862200,5,B005S0STVO,Very nice workout video.,1447632000,,24,5.25
4862201,1,B005S0STVO,"This is the worst yoga DVD I've ever seen. Shiva is more pretentious than usual, giving little instruction on the poses but giving parenting tips as she ""connects"" with the random babies that appear before her in different sets. Also, for someone who just gave birth, some of the initial poses seem to stretch and work the pelvis, which for me was still too sensitive to be working on.",1445817600,,385,4.594202898550725
4862202,5,B005S0STVO,This was a gift that was loved by a fairly new mother!,1443830400,,54,3.5833333333333335
4862203,5,B005S0STVO,I read reviews that complain about the level of interaction between mom and baby.  I think this one does a good job of keeping the baby involved an allowing mom to continue her practice.  It has been useful to me in coming up with ways to keep baby entertained in my self-guided practice.,1439251200,2,288,4.415094339622642
4862204,3,B005S0STVO,Not what I thought it was going to be. My baby was just to squirmy and I could never get throught the whole workout.,1437696000,,116,3.875
4862205,4,B005S0STVO,"Pretty good, excellent for beginners but wish she had more poses involving baby",1437091200,,79,5.153846153846154
4862206,4,B005S0STVO,My baby laughs and enjoys this video.  Of course I usually have to do small segments of it at a time due to my baby wanting other things and short attention span.,1436918400,,162,4.0625
4862207,3,B005S0STVO,It's,1433635200,,4,4.0
4862208,5,B005S0STVO,"I love these workouts they are great to do with my baby! Ive been wanting to get back into yoga, but being a stay at home mom i've had no time to workout by myself. Do be warned however if your baby is crawling you might need to make some noises or play with them in between to keep their attention and keep them from wandering off.",1433289600,,332,3.970149253731343
4862209,2,B005S0STVO,This does not incorporate the baby enough and the workout in general isn't that great/interesting.,1430265600,,98,5.6
4862210,5,B005S0STVO,"I got this DVDs so I could get a quick workout in without leaving the house... This worked perfectly. I have done yoga off and on for years, and this gentle on my post baby body,yet God enough to break a sweat. I did hold my baby more than she did in the DVDs (for added resistance.",1426204800,3,282,3.9649122807017543
4862211,3,B005S0STVO,This is a good yoga video but I wish it involved the baby more.  Most of the video the baby is sitting in a boppy pillow while mom does poses.,1426204800,,142,3.7333333333333334
4862212,3,B005S0STVO,"Love it, but for me. Doesn't involve the babies enough.",1425686400,,55,4.6
4862213,5,B005S0STVO,I love Shiva Rea! I did her prenatal workout and loved it. It helped with a lot of aches and pains during the pregnancy. Now that my daughter is here it is so great to include her in my daily yoga practice. She is always included in what I do and I love how she smiles when I interact with her. I would recommend this to every new mamma,1420243200,,336,3.8840579710144927
4862214,3,B005S0STVO,I feel like you have to have some experience with yoga to enjoy this dvd. You also need a patient baby who doesn't mind just watching you for many of the poses. I was hoping for something a little more interactive.,1416700800,,214,4.2439024390243905
4862215,5,B005S0STVO,Just as advertised,1411257600,,18,5.333333333333333
4862216,1,B005S0STVO,"The video is just yoga while you set your baby to the side, not with your baby.",1404864000,,79,3.7058823529411766
4862217,5,B005S0STVO,This is a great video to show you how to get back into yoga while still spending time with your baby. I really enjoyed it.,1404259200,,122,3.92
4862218,4,B005S0STVO,The series of moves is easy to follow and complete with  your baby. Great buy to exercise with your baby.,1401580800,,105,4.25
4862219,5,B005S0STVO,"Well thought flow, and visually nice (great camera quality/work). Easy for me and fun for baby. There is a lot of opportunity for engaging baby with eye contact along with touch.",1395014400,,178,4.774193548387097
4862220,5,B005S0STVO,My little one loves pures and these are perfect for homemade pures or even jarred food. Would definitely recommend these to any moms or dads.,1394841600,,141,4.68
4862221,5,B005S0STVO,Love it!! Awesome time with my new baby! The interaction with my baby helps me not think about how out of shape I am ! :),1392422400,2,121,3.6923076923076925
4862222,3,B005S0STVO,"The babies in this video are younger than the baby on the DVD cover. They mostly lay around in a boppy looking cute and watching Shiva Rea do yoga. I bought this thinking I'd do yoga while holding/playing with my 1-year old. No dice. (Except for a few squats where you hold the baby.) I do yoga while he walks around the room getting into trouble. So, if you have a baby that is still in paperweight mode, it's probably a great video, but if your kid is a mover, you could get any yoga video. I bought the 3 set ""Yoga for beginners & beyond"" at the same time I bought this one, and I like that one much better.",1392249600,18,610,4.049586776859504
4862223,4,B005S0STVO,I tried this DVD on my ow the first time and it was a great workout. The second time with my 2 months old was a bit tough to keep up and after 15 mins my baby fell asleep so I continued on my own. I think this is better suited for babies that are a bit older and can sit up at least. But it's been a fun experience and I loved bonding with my baby. I would definitely recommend it.,1392249600,3,381,3.658536585365854
4862224,5,B005S0STVO,"I do really like it, but it is a LONG slow 20 minutes. I was looking for something a bit more upbeat and a workout. Great for stretching though.",1391299200,,144,4.0
4862225,3,B005S0STVO,"It would have been a hit if the DVD had offered more exercises for babies and not only watching mom doing them !

Thanks !",1390262400,5,122,3.88
4862226,5,B005S0STVO,"I really like this DVD.  Even though it's not super challenging, it gives great examples of how to interact with baby.  I like that it's broken into 3 sections, making it very conducive for new moms with limited time to do with their babies.  Soothing music and background videography was pleasant and Shiva is a beautiful mom! I'd recommend/buy this for a friend.",1383091200,,364,4.746031746031746
4862227,5,B005S0STVO,"I love how relaxing this DVD is. The back stretches/poses are great for us new moms! I felt great after doing it...i did some of the workout with baby, fed baby, put him to sleep, and finished the rest of the workout during his nap.",1373155200,3,232,4.177777777777778
4862228,5,B005S0STVO,Love doing this with my 4 month old. Great time to bond. It is easy to do and fun. Definitely buy this if you just had baby and or want an activity to do with your little one.,1367193600,,175,3.6315789473684212
4862229,2,B005S0STVO,"I have a very active son.  He likes to be held all the time and move around a lot.  I'm a 500-hr registered yoga teacher and I love Shiva Rea.  I tried going to mommy-and-me yoga but my son's schedule was too unpredictable.  Thought this would be fun but it doesn't incorporate the baby enough.  Best to just do regular yoga and use your instincts.  When my baby was under 6 months I would do warrior poses holding him and even use a carrier.  Or just put him in a play pen near you.  Or wait til baby is sleep.  My baby loves to lay on his back while I do push-up over him or down dog, but you have to have the arm strength for that.  Corpse pose just doesn't work with a little one.  I can sit down and nurse tho.",1355097600,16,715,3.93006993006993
8484498,3,B005S0STVO,I love Shiva Rea-didn't love this specific DVD. I now use my other dvds and baby watches happily. I incorporate her where it feels natural-no need to buy this specific DVD.,1488153600,,172,4.580645161290323
8484499,5,B005S0STVO,Good DVD a little out dated may have been made in the 90s,1487116800,,57,3.4615384615384617
8484500,1,B005S0STVO,"I purchased this DVD the week my son was born, but was not been able to use it until he gained head control. I just opened the DVD this week and the product is cracked. It's been too long since the purchase to return the DVD, but I want to make sure that others don't make the same mistake and purchase this product from the seller. Very disappointed.",1481932800,,351,4.176470588235294
8484501,3,B005S0STVO,It's not a bad DVD. Its not for moms with older babies. Most of all it is not for beginner's at all.,1473379200,,100,3.590909090909091
8484502,1,B005S0STVO,I ordered this yoga DVD to get back in shape after baby. I put the DVD in both my DVD player and my PS4. It will not play in either. I contacted the seller and they were of no assistance.,1473033600,,187,3.7
8484503,5,B005S0STVO,"A sweet little video. I'm a few months late to this review, but I started using it with baby when she was 4/5 months old and she really loved it. She was an active and alert baby, so she really responded to the different movements and loved when it was time for her to be incorporated into the personal attention parts.",1468108800,2,319,4.245901639344262
8484504,1,B005S0STVO,"The content of the disc may be great, but it broke in half when I tried to remove it from the packaging.",1467417600,,104,3.772727272727273
8484505,5,B005S0STVO,Arrived earlier than expected.  The wife and newborn are enjoying it very much.,1458518400,,79,5.076923076923077
8484506,4,B005S0STVO,"Not my favorite yoga dvd, not very realistic to do with a baby but the item was as described and shipped quick!",1448236800,,111,4.090909090909091
8484507,5,B005S0STVO,A great way for Mama and Baby to play and exercise together.,1447977600,,60,4.083333333333333
