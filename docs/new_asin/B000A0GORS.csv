2347567,5,B000A0GORS,"The Brady Bunch is truely a cultural icon of the 1970's.  What's not to love!  My comments here are technical ones. Major kudos to Paramount DVD Televison for a well thought out arrangement with SINGLE-SIDED discs, nice menus, good chapter search capability (to skip the intros when watching an entire disc) and psychedelic colored Slimline case inserts; just an overall neat and tidy package.  A couple of bonus pieces would have been nice and it doesn't come close to the quality of the first season issue.  Just don't rush them out for a quick buck.

However, the Quality Control of these discs is very apparent as they play on every DVD player I have; old or new.  Well done Paramount, well done!  You are blowing Universal Home Video out of the water.  (Hint, Hint to Universal!)",1126569600,5,784,4.713235294117647
2347568,5,B000A0GORS,IM GLAD THERE GETTING THE BRADY BUNCH SEASONS OUT AS QUICK AS THEY CAN. BUT NOTHING IS DONE IN RESTORING THE EPISODES. I THINK THAT SEASON 1 HAD MORE BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN SEASON 2. I SAW FLAWS IN EVERY EPISODE EXCEPT FOR 1. BUT STILL VIEWABLE TO SEE. AS I SEEN ON A COMMERCIAL FOR TV LAND OF THE BRADY BUNCH. WHERE THEY DID THE SOAP COMMERCIAL. THE PICTURE WAS TO0 BRIGHT. THIS IS IN SEASON 3. ALSO YOU THAT HAVE SEASON 2. IS THE SAME THAT HAPPENS IN EVERY EPISODE ON THAT DVD. FROM FINE COLOR TOO BRIGHT. THAN SOME LOOK BLURRY. IM SURE TO EXSPECT THE SAME TREATMENT ON THE OTHER RELEASES. THE SOONER THEY GET THEM OUT THE LESS THEY CAN DO TO RESTORE THEM.,1125273600,3,663,4.147286821705427
2347569,5,B000A0GORS,"I'm very happy that Paramount is releasing The Brady Bunch uncut and quickly. My favorite episodes are the Vacation episodes such as The trip to The Grand Canyon,they where just fun episodes to watch. I never scen The Grand Canyon episodes uncut before,so this will be a real treat for me. Season 4 will be out in Nov of this year and that season contains there trip to Hawaii with guest star Vincent Price,fun episodes. Paramount is doing a great job with The Brady Bunch,uncut full length episodes. I just wish Paramount would release more Happy Day's season sets!",1124496000,4,566,4.7272727272727275
2347570,5,B000A0GORS,"Woo-hoo. The Bradys are in Season 3 and can only go up from here. Highlights include......

50. Ghost Town, U.S.A.

The Bradys go to the Grand Canyon. Well they get a little sidetracked and end up in the pokey. Marsha looks sexy behind bars. Peter learns how to build shanks, and Mike is aroused by being locked up with four males.

51. Grand Canyon or Bust

They get to the Grand Canyon, and wouldn't you know it? Bobby and Cindy decide to chase after Indian boys and get lost.

52. The Brady Braves

Well now the Bradys are full fledged members of the Indian tribe. Wonder if they get a profit from gaming?

53. The Wheeler-Dealer

Greg buys a lemon and learns an important lesson about screwing people over.

54. My Sister, Benedict Arnold

A personal favorite. The sexual tension between Greg and Marsha is at an all-time high when they date each other's rivals.

55. The Personality Kid

Peter decides being a bad Humphrey Bogart is better than being a nobody.

56. Juliet is the Sun

Marsha may be hot, but she can't let it go to her head. She learns a valuable lesson in that 'less is more'. Fortunately she continued to wear the mini-skirts.

57. And Now, A Word From Our Sponsor

A creepy weirdo stalks the Bradys in a supermarket parking lot. He wants to do a commercial with them, but old level headed Mike Brady will do no such thing unless the family tests the product themselves. Brilliant Mike, no more three episode family vacations for you. If they did the commercial they could have had the money for a trip to Vegas. Who wouldn't want to see Marsha dance at Circus Circus?

58. The Private Ear

Peter pretends he's J. Edgar Hoover and taps the Brady's phone conversations.

59. Her Sister's Shadow

Jan is the ultimate Brady loser. First she can't make cheerleader, then she can't win an essay contest. Marsha! Marsha! Marsha!

60. Click

Greg wants to play football, Carol is afraid he'll get hurt. Alice serves ribs for dinner and Greg becomes a wimp photographer.

61. Getting Davy Jones

Just like Joe Namath, any celebrity will come to the Brady's rescue.

62. The Not-So-Rose-Colored Glasses

Jan is at it again. She screws up and the kids bail her out. But then wise Mike figures out Jan didn't have her glasses yet when the original portrait was made.

63. The Teeter-Totter Caper

Bobby and Cindy are whiny again. Little kids are people too is the message here. They go for the world record teeter totter, but Greg really thought they were digging for oil.

64. Big Little Man

Bobby wants to be big. Knowing that the grandmother of Otto von Bismark was a fox does not help.

65. Dough Re Mi

Insert Peter's voice here ""When it's time to ChAnGe"". Yes this is the one. Groovy Greg tunes sung by idiotic children.

66. Jan's Aunt Jenny

Jan is once again in a crisis. She's not pretty and discovers the truth from her aunt that she never will be.

67. The Big Bet

It becomes clear that Greg is a total wimp when he's beaten in a chin-up contest by a six year old.

68. The Power of the Press

Peter follows in his groovy older brother's footsteps. Instead of being a photographer though, he's into journalism. Wise Mike Brady once again comes to the rescue by telling him that people like to see their names in the paper.

69. Sergeant Emma

Alice needs a break and gets an Army Drill Sergeant to whip the Bradys into a disciplined fighting unit.

70. Cindy Brady, Lady

Cindy's mind is blown when it is revealed her 'secret admirerer' was all a big joke at her expense.

71. My Fair Opponent

This episode will remind you of the Eva Grubb episode from 'Gilligan's Island'.

72. The Fender Benders

Carol 'A woman driver' is losing a traffic court case. She's such a nut behind the wheel that her own kids are testifying against her. Mike comes to the rescue again by throwing briefcases in the courtroom. Instead of being arrested for contempt of court, Carol goes free.",1123027200,17,3898,4.512160228898426
2347571,5,B000A0GORS,"With eldest siblings Marcia and Greg quickly approaching their respective heights of groovyness, ignoring the younger and less popular Brady's would have been too easy for the scripting department at this point in the 'Brady Bunch' series.

Instead many episodes in this 23-episode 1971-1972 season pointedly explore Cindy and Bobby's quest to fit in with their other family members. Both are encouraged to like themselves for being who they are instead of trying to become somebody else. You cannot have other people like you unless you do not first like yourself.

In the 3-part Grand Canyon adventure opening this season, Bobby and Cindy become lost from their family on a camping trip.  They meet up with Jimmy, a young Indian (Michael Campo). Jimmy is also running away from his family because he feels isolated by his grandfather's expectations. In return for helping them get safely back to Camp Brady, Jimmy receives food from Bobby and Cindy. All of these kids panic when they are discovered, but all ends well for everybody.

""In Big Little Man"" Bobby embarks on a quest to become physically bigger. When this does not work with the speed which he had originally preferred, Bobby sets out to become a mental giant instead. ""Mr. Brady"" himself---Robert Reed---directs this episode.

Finally ""Cindy Brady, Lady"" shows Bobby having a friend of his play `secret admirer' to his forlorn sister. Cindy is upset at having to be the youngest sibling in the family.  Bobby's action is really sweet specifically because I don't know of many brothers (including my own) who actually would think of doing this. Then again, it could be Bobby's empathy from his own age issues.

We also continue dealing with Jan's ongoing psychological issues mentioned during the previous seasons.

Jan is trying out for pom pom girl (""Her Sisters Shadow"") so that her teachers will stop comparing her to `Marcia..Marcia..Marcia'. Even though Jan fails to be picked, it shows her determination to exercise an `independent streak' when being a copy-cat of Marcia would have been so much easier. Anybody can relate to always being compared to somebody whom you are not.

Jan then learns that real beauty is inside a person when she meets her Aunt Jenny (Imogene Coco) in ""Jan's Aunt Jenny"". Because they had looked a lot alike in her childhood photographs, Jan is worried that she will look just like Aunt Jenny now does when she is older. Yet talking with Aunt Jenny subsequently gives Jan a new perspective---somebody else knows about the issues she is now going through. Coco was a really big star so Paramount's ability to snag her for a guest appearance demonstrates the clout which this series had gained.

The Brady Bunch again proves why it sticks in the American psyche with this season. Many episodes delivered memorable social statements on tolerance, individuality, and identity without nagging to their audience.",1122681600,26,2904,5.03125

The first three episodes where the family vacations to the Grand Canyon (with guest appearances from Jim Backus of Gilligan's Island fame) are classics!  This is a throw-back to 1960s television at its best!  Sherwood Schwartz (creator of The Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island), you've done it again!  I recommend everyone picking this up and adding it to their dvd library!",1344902400,,702,4.658536585365853

2347745,5,B000A0GORS,"This DVD set contains all 23 season 3 episodes from 1971-1972 and this was the year the series started doing big-time location shoots. The first episode is the show's first three-parter in which the Bradys embark upon the beautiful Grand Canyon. A ghost town, Cindy and Bobby becoming lost, and the family becoming honorary members of an Indian tribe, are some of the highlights from these shows. Jim Backus, Imogene Coca, Davy Jones, and Jackie Coogan all guest star in season three. The funniest show this year is ""Sergeant Emma"" in which Ann B. Davis plays a dual role where Alice's identical cousin cares for the Bradys while she is away. ""In Her Sister's Shadow"" features Jan being upset because she is tired of always being Marcia's younger sister. The famous line from this episode is ""Marica, Marcia, Marcia!"". ""The Private Ear"" is very similar from season two's ""The Tattletale"" in which Peter uses a hidden tape recorder to record conversations at the Brady house. Another fabulous season of a fabulous series. These episodes can be watched over and over by a new generation of younsters. Shows like ""The Brady Bunch"" are missing from network TV today which explains the erosion of viewers from the big commercial networks.",1252627200,4,1233,4.9326923076923075
2347766,5,B000A0GORS,"I grew up loving Brady Bunch and now all my children love it too.  Pretty wholesome, clean, funny shows.  The only problem is that they wear their skirts too short!  Highly recommend this show as one of the only TVs shows to show your child!",1251936000,,241,4.311111111111111
2347767,5,B000A0GORS,"The Brady Bunch - The Complete Third Season is probably my favorite season of this classic family sitcom. My favorite episodes from season 3 include: The Personality Kid, Juliet is the Sun, And Now a Word From Our Sponsor, Her Sister's Shadow, and The Teeter-Totter Caper. This is the season when Jan says, Marsha, Marsha, Marsha - it's hilarious. Jan is my favorite of the kids, she's so moody - I love it! I highly recommend all five seasons, enjoy!",1246147200,2,451,4.65
2347768,5,B000A0GORS,"Awesome box set.  This is season three - one of the best in my opinion.  The kids have worked together now a full two seasons and it shows.  They are familiar with each other and the acting is much smoother - well, as smooth as the Brady's ever get! The kids are also still a bit younger - something that appeals to me much more than when they all got a little too old.  This is the season where we start out with The Grand Canyon episode the three part season opener.  Season three also contains the classic 'Pork chops and applesauce' and Marcia, Marcia, Marcia episodes.  There's a lot of real good, long forgotten gems in this set - remember the teeter totter contest and Davy Jones coming to visit?  Definitely a much needed addition to your vintage 70's TV collection.",1231632000,4,774,4.408450704225352
2347769,5,B000A0GORS,A great DVD. My children love watching it and can't believe that I use to watch it. They think it's funny how they dress and the words they used back then. It's so much better for them to watch this than what's on TV now. I definitely recommend it.,1206921600,3,248,4.081632653061225
2347770,5,B000A0GORS,"""It's always Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!"" ""These glasses make me look absolutely goofy!""  ""We're having pork chops and apple sauce.""  There are so many memorable lines from these Season Three episodes that highlighted the series with some of the best shows.  The entertaining ""vacation"" episodes open the season with a family trip to the Grand Canyon.  By the fourth episode Greg is ""wheeling and dealing"" for a new car, continued by the Brady family getting chosen for a TV commercial, Jan getting glasses, and the kids begin their singing career (even though Peter's voice is changing).  The scripts are fresh and entertaining, the kids have some of their best moments in this season with Jan overcoming ""her sister's shadow,"" also meeting her Aunt Jenny which has comic appeal with the nuttiness of Emogene Coacoa.  Marcia dates Greg's arch rival Warren Maloney, and Greg dates Marcia's arch rival Cathy.  And the battle of the ""little kids"" with Bobby tired of being a ""shrimpo"" and a ""pee-wee,"" and Bobby and Cindy both setting out to show ""little kids can do important things too"" as they attempt to set a new ""teeter-totter"" record.  These episodes are both memorable and charming as ""The Brady Bunch"" continued with their ""out of sight"" and ""groovy"" family togetherness that both entertained and delighted their fans then and now.  Followed by two more ""super cool"" seasons!",1147132800,3,1378,5.035242290748899
2347771,5,B000A0GORS,This was my third favorite season.  I especially liked the two shows where they filmed in the Grand Canyon.  I finally got to go to the Grand Canyon in 2004--it's as beautiful in person! TV doesn't do it justice!,1141516800,2,212,4.410256410256411

2347806,5,B000A0GORS,"I've noticed some reviewers complaining about the lack of ""In Color"" messages at the beginning of the shows, as well as missing cast boxes on the Grand Canyon episodes.  I'm pretty sure that the ""In Color"" messages were never present on these episodes in the first place.  I think that practice had been abandoned by the start of the 1971-72 seasons of all TV shows.  In the ""All in the Family"" DVD box sets, only Season One (Spring 1971) has the ""In Color"" message.  Season Two (Fall 1971-Spring 1972) did NOT have it.  I don't think ANY shows had them by that time.  Color television had been around for long enough at that point that continuing to brag about shows being ""In Color"" would have tended to be overkill by then, don't you think?  Of course I can't swear to it, but I really think that they are not missing since they were likely never there at all.

As for the missing cast boxes on the Grand Canyon episodes, maybe those particular episodes did not use them.  That is completely a guess on my part, but since the episodes were of a different nature than the other single part episodes, maybe that practice was not used for them.  I could be completely wrong about that, but it seems to me to be a real possibility.  How many people remember for sure if they had those boxes from the original airing?  I was BORN right around the time this season wrapped, so I obviously did not see them first-run.  I have no clue if the syndicated reruns I watched in the late 1970's had cast boxes on those episodes or not.  Can anyone say for absolute certainty that the boxes DID exist for those episodes?

Don't pass on this box set for just these reasons alone.  I don't want anything to be missing from my TV show box sets either (some of my other reviews will attest to that), but in a case like this even if those two items did exist at one time and are in fact missing here, what IS here far outweighs those particular items.  Buy this box set if you like ""The Brady Bunch"", and you'll be glad you did.",1127174400,4,2011,4.334224598930481
2347807,5,B000A0GORS,"Great series. Wish there were extras in the set.  Really dislike the Paramount Promos on the first disk that you can skip - you have to fast forward through them.

There must have been a sale at Sears when they made this show! I Really started noticing the clothes. I never noticed but The kids wear the same stuff all the time!  Count how many times Greg wears that white sweater with the dark blue stripes! Count how many times Mrs. Brady wears the Gold paisley pants suit (sometime the whole outfit, but mostly the top with other 70's pants- she wears this in at al least a dozen episodes in seasons 2 & 3)!  And Peter sure like his red and white striped shirt! He wore it on the trip to the Grand Canyon and all throughout the season.

This show is so good. Fun to watch over and over again!",1127088000,3,795,4.203947368421052

Like I said in the review for the Season 2 set,Brady Bunch fans will own a copy of the entire series before too long. The only difference between this season and the previous two are the Brady kids growing taller. This is immediately noticeable with Greg(Barry Williams). He must have grown about six inches in height since the series premiered in 1969. Williams was 15 years old then. Carol's(Florence Henderson) youngest daughter Cindy(Susan Olsen)is starting to outgrow her cuteness. Even oldest daughter Marcia(Maureen McCormick)is maturing into a beautiful young woman.

Now that's over and I could never find enough Brady Bunch episodes to satiate my desire to relive the series of my youth (Marcia and I are about the same age). Of course, I couldn't identify with the Brady's growing up in my household, but they were an ""escape"" of sorts and I guess I like to relive the escape through the reruns.

I just love having them in my collection and any time I need an ""escape"", I can pop in any DVD from their first, second or third year and get one.",1126915200,2,701,4.139705882352941

24 episodes in all on 4 discs. Paramount did a good job with these. The prints are nowhere near as bad as some customers here are making them out to be.

One minor quibble: This season set omits the opening ""THE BRADY BUNCH in color"" slides. I remember them being used for all 5 seasons and they were included on the first and second season sets so why not on this set?

I also don't like the fact that Paramount (for some strange reason) decided to omit the cast boxes that appear near the end of each episode just before the ending tag comes up that leads into the ending credits. This is done on all three Grand Canyon episodes. What was the point? When something is sold as ""The Complete...."" I really expect it to be just that: COMPLETE.",1126742400,2,963,4.338888888888889
