8221235,3,B000077VR5,It's a good video. All backcountry jumps but the music - horrible. The  music killed this entire video for me. I'll be watching it on mute from now on.,1379462400,,151,4.206896551724138
8221236,5,B000077VR5,"I bought this as a gift for someone.  And he said he absolutely loved it.  If you're into snowboarding, I think it's a must see.",1331510400,,128,4.08
8221237,4,B000077VR5,"Vivid had some of the best tricks and steepest mountian descents i have ever seen, the music was also very good. The film was also not drawn out as bad as some snowboard films i hae seen, they had a lot of great camera shots, in all it was a good film",1080864000,2,251,3.8461538461538463
8221238,5,B000077VR5,"What the hell is someone from florida doing writing about a snowboard movie.  Vivid, transendance, and tribal are some of the best new original snowboarding movies to be released in the last few years. As someone who has logged over 70 days a season since high school(Rockies, Utah, Whistler, Quebec) I respect the effort to break from the current hip -hop, punk rock, format that has dominanted snowboarding movies for the last few years.  I am not the type of person who ususally writes a review but seeing as I'm liviving in korea recovering from a case of acl/mcl damage I find it hard to read a review that has some one from florida at number 1, when I try to order a video. I find it hard to beleive that someone who lives in the sunshine state is given a voice in a review of a snowboard video that truley represents more aspects of ridding in one minute than most do in thirty. I find myself compelled to write. Regardless anyone who buys this video will see what truley can be done when you commit yourself to pushing your limits.  Buy this and any film that gets you stoked, this video represents the buzz that those who truly do paticipate in the sport.  Well thats it, but for anyone like me  who has to watch the sport they love, this is one of the videos you will find some confort in. If your knees won't what you love anymore rent or buy ""the endless summer two"" and you see that there is life after snowboarding.
Amazon please don't let anyone from floida talk about snowboarding again",1069027200,4,1502,4.407942238267148
8221239,5,B000077VR5,"The dude who wrote the review ""Right idea, bad execution"" obviously has no idea about snowboarding purely from his comments about Roman deMarchi section and money falling on him. . .Apart from the fact he didn't know who the dude was, and the fact this is by far the best section of the movie.  think about it dude. . .money rules! money talks!  I suppose you missed the slightly weird bit at the end of this section which is homage to ""Apocalypse Now"". . .humm figured.
Anyway, Vivid rocks, breaks new ground with stunning use of 16mm, and although focuses a little too much on just big backcountry kickers, and yes, you're right in that this does get a bit boring after a while. . .
Its a snowboarding flick. . . live with it, and try getting off you're bum and riding instead.
Go big, or die.

8221240,4,B000077VR5,"I don't usually watch these things, and I certainly couldn't do any of the things that these guys do. But this is the only DVD I've seen that gives this skier some sense of what he's missing by not strapping his feet onto a board.
Parents (and grandparents) looking for a cool gift for a 10-13 year old should consider this. There's some language and explicit lyrics, not to mention some pretty unsafe (and some illegal) behavior, but its all in good fun. Be sure to check out the sponsors' clips at the end. These vary, but some -- like Burton's -- are amazing.
All in all: Impressive stuff impressively presented.",1042588800,4,615,4.54954954954955
8221241,5,B000077VR5,"Tired of the same old formula? Here's some next level [stuff] that will be setting the new standard. Rice, deMarchi, Solberg, Jones and Pauporte deliver some unforgettable riding, while names like Muller, Kalbermatten and Moore make some big deposits of their own in your long-term memory banks. Impossible new camera angles that let you tag along within high-fiving distance of some of the best riders on the planet.",1038873600,,417,5.147058823529412
