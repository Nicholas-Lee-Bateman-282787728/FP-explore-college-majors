8448758,5,B004YQXBD4,"This DVD is a broad look at Britains RAF with the emphasis on the mission and strategies rather than a super detailed look at all the particular RAF aircraft. While the RAF does fly US made aircraft, the main feature is that of British built aircraft.

 Episode Five features interviews with Sir Patrick Hine, ACM as well as various group captains regarding their particular aircraft and missions.  Both Iraq and Bosnia operations are discussed overlaid with good quality flying scenes.

Episode Six looks at the RAF and the RNAS from its birth through WWII. There are various interviews with former pilots of that era, again overlaid with good quality flying scenes. Some of the flying scenes include restored WWII aircraft. Coastal Command and their role past and present receives a lot of attention in this episode.

Episode Seven looks at the RAFs role in air supply of all types, including refueling.

Bonus Harrier Sequence,  provides some non- verbal flying scenes of the Harrier from inside the cockpit and air-to-air shots.

Well worth the money for a good look at the RAF.",1360454400,,1082,4.939226519337017
