7936967,5,B00005B7DG,"I love these movies set -- Wish that they took it one more step -- The monkey wasn't funny, the the doctor was great as was her nurse -- Lock me up and keep the key",1271635200,,164,3.5833333333333335
7936968,3,B00005B7DG,"This is a hot little movie. Yes I wish they would be more explicit, but it is what it is. Nice bodies, nice matchyos, and a stupid plot. regular fare for Seduction. The hispanic chick is thick and hot though. I like that.",1203724800,,221,4.162790697674419
7936969,3,B00005B7DG,"I thought this was an enjoyable movie. The reason I got the movie was because it has Katie Jordon in it. To me any movie with Katie is worth seeing. But that aside, it was also an enjoyable movie with a simple plot that was acted out quite well.",1163030400,,245,4.020408163265306
7936970,5,B00005B7DG,"Okay, you can't really review a film like this. I like seeing Darien Caine get nekkid with cute chicks, and if you're a fan of lesbian sex (and what straight guy isn't) then you'll enjoy this film. I guess there's some sort of plot, and a gorilla wanders into the frame sometimes, but it's mostly nothing but cute babes doing it, and I don't have the willpower to resist it's charms. I'm very fond of Darien, but Katie Jordon (who has retired to pursuit another career) is a cutie, and so is the gal who plays the nurse. This film delivers the exploitation goods: Boobies and simulated oral sex. And Darien naked.",1156636800,,613,4.482142857142857
7936971,1,B00005B7DG,"This was a horrible movie that was not worth the time. It did not even come close to its predecessor.  A lot of screaming and yelling, and the stupid ape is back with a hat that lets him communicate in English. The acting is terrible, the writing is worse and unless you are into nipple rings and tounge studs the girl on girl scenes aren't much fun either.  The girl reporter and the sheriff may be the two worst roles that were ever filmed. Save your money.",1064016000,2,459,4.264367816091954
7936972,4,B00005B7DG,"I am sure of one thing-I enjoyed The Erotic Witch Project 2 much more than I did The Blair Witch Project 2.  This film does have a distinct connection to its erotic predecessor, but the moviemakers eventually stop worrying about keeping a storyline intact and just concentrate on the girls.  One of the three girls missing from the Erotic Witch hunting trio of the first movie has been found (happily, it is my personal favorite Darian Kane).  Darian is being held in some type of low-budget private psychiatric hospital, bound in a strait-jacket due to the intensity of her constantly overwhelming sexual urges.  Her female doctor suspects that she may have contracted some form of sexually transmitted disease of intense eroticism in the course of her mysterious ordeal in the haunted woods.  Her diagnosis definitely seems to have some validity based on the events related in this film.  After talking the strangely underdressed nurse into removing the strait-jacket, Darian infects her with eroticism, and then the nurse spreads the condition on to the doctor.  About this time, an attractive female reporter (Katie Jordan) shows up trying to find out if Darian is actually being held inside the institution.  When she eventually gets the chance to speak to the patient, she learns that Darian demands a certain ""price"" for her story.  I think you see where all of this is going.  You end up with a room full of five quite erotic females before the film ends.
To my intense surprise and consternation, the stupid gorilla from the first movie appears here in the sequel.  As if he's not annoying enough to begin with, now he is equipped with some type of technologically advanced cap that allows him to actually converse with the girls.  Why on earth would the writers do this to the audience?  Fortunately, the gorilla debacle is somewhat minimized by the presence of the reporter's presumably Russian cameraman.  At first, his constant arguments with the reporter are pretty annoying, but once he gets inside the hospital and begins documenting the types of activities these hot and bothered young ladies keep engaging in, he becomes incredibly funny.  The infusion of so much comedy into a script that basically gives up on the charade of a plot midway through the film really saves this erotic sequel from mediocrity.
As for the ""making of feature"" included on the DVD, it's OK but nothing spectacular.  It was nice to see how much fun the cast had making this film.  It also helps solve the mystery as to why some of the dialogue sounds as if it was made up on the spur of the moment; it's because some of the dialogue actually was made up on the spur of the moment.  Oftentimes, the director would just tell an actress the basic idea about what she is supposed to say and just have her go with the flow in terms of saying it.
Overall, the first The Erotic Witch Project is a much better movie than this sequel.  Whereas it portrayed itself unabashedly as a total spoof of The Blair Witch Project, this sequel barely even tries to play off of anything from Blair Witch 2.  EWP 2: The Book of Seduction is really all about the girls and the action, making it a racier, definitely more erotic but far less compelling movie than its predecessor.",1043798400,20,3250,4.738898756660746
7936973,5,B00005B7DG,"Well, they have a monkey and naked girls kissing. Nothing more you can ask for. The fat chick is not in this movie (Victoria). And the hot blonde is gone too (Katie). But they do have some hottier chicks? Nothing to do with the Blair Witch 2.
Get the DVD for the special features. Like behind the project and stuff. But in part 3 I want to see more naked girls and less talking. I am the greatest.",1009324800,5,397,4.102564102564102
7936974,3,B00005B7DG,"This movie is very rude. As I feel that movies have no business
being ""morally redemptive"", this is quite good for what it is.
I do have one obervation, I don't think you would normally see
so many tatoos on a doctor.
Of course that hand held camera is quite annoying, but you do
not watch a movie like this for the cinematography - perhaps
for the SINematography.",1000339200,6,364,4.367647058823529
7936975,5,B00005B7DG,"The lone survivor of the Erotic Witch Project creates havoc while undergoing psychiatric treatment at a top-secret medical facility. THIS IS A COMEDY! Director John Bacchus has broken the boredom of sex-laden direct-to-video erotic filmmaking, churning out movie after movie at breakneck pace (hard for even me to keep up with) with an incredible end product each time. EROTIC WITCH 2 is his best yet, being the funniest and sexiest of anything he's done so far. All the acting is great, the direction & editing are way better than usual for this format...and then there's Darian Caine. While she's the only returning actress from the first movie, she steals the show every time with her uninhibited & energetic performance. She's just so damn funny, and not afraid to be non-sexual if the moment is right. Truly a great talent, I would probably watch anything as long as she was in it. Darian brings even more fire to an already hot picture. Way more NUDITY & SEX than in the original. There are at least 5 or 6 girl/girl sex scenes with full nudity, all softcore (of course). The 3-way at the end of the first one is topped here by a 5-way featuring all the female actresses that appear in the film. Unlike the first movie, the plot of this one doesn't even try to imitate the plot of BLAIR WITCH 2: BOOK OF SHADOWS. I guess no one really saw it so they didn't figure anyone would care. Plus, they were limited to shooting on video. Ah, what am I complaining about? This movie rules! And like the other Bacchus DVDs, this one features a 30-minute ""making of"" featurette and a ton of trailers for other Seduction Cinema releases. Can you beat that? Put this one on at your next party and see who becomes an instant fan! EROTIC WITCH 1, MISTRESS FRANKENSTEIN, and EROTIC SURVIVOR are also highly recommended.",991872000,16,1808,4.635514018691588
