8197810,2,B000QUTTTM,"DREAMS OF THE DEAD  and THE HAUNTING OF DANBURY HOUSE are the same film. It includes a pseudo history. Samuel Arnold, a mad hatter, murdered two girls and was never caught. Now their ghosts haunt the house, but they aren't that scary since one them doesn't wear clothes. Did they have thong underwear a 100 years ago? Descendant Aubrey Arnold (Cathy Loch) is a singer and songwriter and wants to hold a recording session in the house against the wishes of her father. Ghosts? yes. Scary? No. In fact there is a scene where they all sit around the table and discuss the house that lasts way way too long. Sound is choppy. They filmed in the rain and it sounds like they simply put a plastic bag around the microphone to annoyingly magnify the raindrops.  Available on multi-packs.

Filmed in Allentown, Pa.

Use your own judgment. By removing those scenes the movie is somewhat dull. It's available under ""other sellers"" in the Amazon listing from me, the Director, Writer and Editor, John Orrichio.
