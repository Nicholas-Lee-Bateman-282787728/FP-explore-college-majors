8173515,5,B0009SCV3W,"A movie with a few surprises. The story of a ""bad woman"", played magnificently by the unique Maria Antonieta Pons, who proves (once more), she was a talented performer, good actress as well as Rumba Dancer. She is the perfect option to play that part. The movie is pleasant, the story of the demon who want to pass as an angel. Miss Pons recently divorced from Juan Orol, was in her own, better than ever. One of the first Mexican movies  for Spanish Actor Armando Calvo, who does good his part. Comedian ""Chino Herrera"" and Cuban Eduardo Casado, play also very good. Maria Antonieta ""The Cuban in Mexico"", is, as always, superb. The ending of the movie is that interesting, you will wish it continues. Good DVD to see Maria Antonieta Pons, and enjoy it.",1179360000,3,754,4.5851851851851855
