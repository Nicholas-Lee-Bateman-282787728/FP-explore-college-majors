2867256,5,B000RGSX3I,I really like this DVD. Linda Jones shows you so many beautiful design techniques and she makes them very easy to understand. When you get through with this DVD you will not believe all of the skills you learned to incorporate into your designs.,1352332800,,245,4.590909090909091

2867259,5,B000RGSX3I,"After reading several books on beading and wire working, I felt like I understood the basic concepts, but I needed to SEE how to do things (like hammer wire,which I didn't find to be explained clearly in any of the books) to feel confident beginning to make my own jewelry. In the absence of local classes, I decided to pick up this DVD.

This is an excellent tutorial to wire and beaded jewelry that I would recommend to anyone interested in the craft. The instructions are clear and the camera angles are perfect for seeing what the iinstructor is doing. Jones' teaching is perfectly paced, and she makes working with wire look both appealing and doable. While watching the DVD, I was inspired and excited, wanting to jump right in and work along with her (but I don't have any wire yet, so couldn't';-) )

All the projects (or variations) are attractive, and if you don't quite like the main project, Jones shows options for variations (like making a necklace instead of a bracelet).

I especially liked the section on making ones own findings (jump rings, head pins, toggle clasps, etc.), which can be a money saver and a way to practice and perfect many of the wire-working skills, such as making loops.

The final project--a necklace that incorporates all the techniques used in the first part of the DVD, plus a few more--looks really fun to make. The only thing missing from the DVD (which doesn't affect the 5-star rating...as I'd give it 10 stars if I could!) is a list of materials needed for each project.",1276560000,9,1517,4.649253731343284

2867261,5,B000RGSX3I,"Linda Jones' Creating Wire & Beaded Jewelry DVD is one of the most comprehensive wire & bead ""how-to"" instructionals I've ever seen.  DVD's are the pefect way to learn to do beading or any other type of craft.  So many of us are ""visual"" folks, and seeing it done makes everything that much clearer - and, it doesn't hurt that you can go back and watch the same thing over and over, to help perfect your technique!  The camera work is top-notch, and there are TONS of those great, close-close up views that are so helpful.  Linda is neat and precise (always laying aside tools and wire she's not working with when demonstrating a technique - a good habit to get into from the start), but she's very easy going and her British accent is fun to listen to!  She encourages creativity, and shows several projects from start to finish.  Her overview of tools is clear and comprehensive as well.  She does not advocate any one vendor for beading tools (I like BeadSmith, myself, which provides good mid-priced tools that work well) and she makes it clear that while it is helpful to have good tools, it's is definitely a matter of what works best for you.  I was able to find all the tools she mentions in her DVD on-line and through my local Hobby Lobby store.  There are a ton of places out there to get this stuff, including Amazon.com, of course!  Linda shows how to do everything from making a simple beaded link bracelet to doing caged beads, creating your own clasps, how to work-harden wire for clasps, etc., AND she makes a beautiful necklace in the last chapter that utilizes ALL the techniques learned throughout the DVD.  If I had to choose one thing that I would have liked her to touch on, it would have been a short informational segment on wire hardness and type of wire to use.  I imagine what she was using for her DVD was sterling silver wire, but she never said for sure. I use sterling silver and a new-ish type of wire called Argentium, which is .925 sterling silver with the alloy germanium added to it, which virtually eliminates the tarnishing problem that sterling silver suffers from. She did mention the wire she was using was 20-gauge wire, which is what I use.  There are three hardnesses of wire: dead soft, half-hard and full-hard. I believe she uses dead-soft wire for demonstrating her techniques, as this wire is soft and easy to shape.  It's perfect for doing wire-wrapping, caging beads, etc.  She shows how to use a chasing hammer and a small steel block (easily available at major beading sites like firemountain.com) to work-harden the dead-soft wire so it can be used for clasps without pulling apart. I'd never seen this technique before, and it was a BLAST to do (but WATCH your FINGERS!).  In Summary:  Linda's DVD provides good, clear camera work, concise, repeated visuals, and good verbal explanations which make this DVD a STEAL for anyone who wants to learn to bead using wire.  NOTE:  Linda does NOT include any information on how to bead using flexible beading wire - if you want to know how to do this, plus a variety of other techniques, I recommend Lesley Moussette's DVD's ""Bead Basics"" and ""Wire Wrap,"" (only available through her website, backspin.us), which are unbelieveably comprehensive without being overwhelming, covering everything from wire wrapping different kinds of beads (including briolettes), to knotting beads onto silk cord, looming, and doing off-loom stitchwork with seed beads. I hope Linda Jones continues to make more DVD's throughout her career - she's AMAZING!  Happy Beading!",1263168000,31,3550,4.760195758564437

8200699,5,B000RGSX3I,"Many fine arts DVDs are short and only reveal the how-to's f one or two things.  This DVD is huge and covers all of what you need to know to do the basics and venture off on your own.  This is almost like a small video library offered on a single disc, at a single disc price, and not some $99 set.  Very pleased with this, especially when it is compared to other discs on the market and the prices and coverage of those discs.  Excellent DVD.",1369526400,3,443,4.057471264367816
