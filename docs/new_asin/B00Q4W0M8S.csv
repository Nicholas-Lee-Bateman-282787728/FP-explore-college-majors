8690334,4,B00Q4W0M8S,"This is actually a very interesting series from the point of intellectual history, and indeed not only the time period that it treats mostly, roughly around the Nazi era. But also in terms of how a number of contingent or collateral issues to the intellectual matters of that difficult era as they are interpreted today, which is almost a separate fascinating issue in itself. The wife of Dietrich von Hildebrand who is interviewed  in depth for the series clearly has complex mind and a great memory, and she also seems delightfully oblivious to trying to hew to some de facto script or set of dangerous issues. This is very interesting in reference to that balance between received ideas and memories of the times period, referenced earlier. For Hildebrand himself it seems later became very embroiled, and almost symbolic, of a kind of revanchist Catholicism that even opposed some of the liturgical changes of Vatican II. Indeed, now his name or personage online, if general Google  searches are any measure, seems more connected with a whole zany world of conspiratorial ideation about all sorts of things in relation to the Catholic Church's changes at Vatican II. This does seem a shame, because he seems to have be  quite virtuous in his clear vision, from his own faith commitments as a Catholicism, that Nazism and its entire Weltanschauung, was a blight and a nihilistic danger. As well, as his virtuous opposition  to anti-Semitism.

Unfortunately, that same off-script aspect of his wife's commentary, also is informative of why it is that his persona posthumously seems so embroiled in the popular online world with quite so much craziness. His memoirs seems to diplomatically indicate that he was interested in a revanchist , monarchist worldview specifically only for a kind of tactical reason of keeping Austria independent, when the Nazi threat was so close. But his wife Alice added something more, and  somehow stumbled into saying, again  seemingly off-script, that in fact Hildebrand was a monarchist all around, through and through. In fact she expounded on the matter, with the interviewer  looking rather surprised and helpless, that merely having to change elected leaders every so many years really was a terrible thing, and not good for the health of societies generally. I really was astounded that she was saying these things, and one must thank God for the famous insouciance of the old in not sugar coating  their views, for this is revelatory of the oft hidden substratum of of view of this sort of Catholic. Of course the  hyper-monarchical view is ridiculous, and quite nasty in another sense. Not to mentions as well  being a form of massive ingratitude for the very democratic world that quashed the Nazi evil in the first place. Mrs. Hildebrand seems to have had a nice career in this democratic land, and somehow is unembarrassed to cast dark aspersions on the very system of government that has given her succor. A strange attitude indeed, and one that makes her statements about morality  seem dubious prima facie.

 I am afraid that Alice von Hildebrand's surprising honesty here was sadly indicative of why indeed Diietrich's persona is now so embroiled in weird ideation. Therefore, one was scarcely surprised  to even here the hoary tropes of incoherent Anti-Masonc notions being attributed in the most flamboyant and colorful fashion by his wife to her husband as well. (One can only recommend again  J.N. Roberts' The Mythology of Secret Societies as a sane, historically coherent corrective)  Simply put,  if a figure like Hildebrand's  world-view includes demeaning  democracy itself in a total way, it is not hard to see how they could become admixed with wacky notions that Freemasons somehow wanted communists  to come to power, f an assertion or which there is not a shred of historical evidence. Ironically, and a bit tragically for Hildebrand's long-term reputation, the nexus of ideas  from which  such notions  about Freemasonry emanate , is poignantly the very  same nexus in which Anti-Semitic notions swirled  around, with the same lack of historical responsiblity giving general momentum. (As the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, I put emphasis on such things.) This would seem to tarnish somewhat Hildebrand's otherwise quite virtuous resolve on these matters. Human beings are surely a mix, but one should identify  virtue where it is seen, even if admixed a bit nastily with contradictions.

A fine aspect of the show, in general,  is the interviewer's  extremely well-prepared questions. He is someone who clearly has immersed himself in the period in reference to his subject, and it makes for very interesting  queries on a whole host of matters. The result is, in general, a a very involving intellectual history.",1418169600,4,4782,5.084507042253521
