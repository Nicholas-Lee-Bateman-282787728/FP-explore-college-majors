8699648,5,B00SX12WFY,"This is a great DVD, Ed revealing his thoughts about his career so far. Really appreciated that it wasn't anyone else talking about Ed - just Ed himself, being open, honest and at times really funny. There just aren't enough musicians out there like him - he is just so natural, and that's part of why his music is so unbelievable and so refreshing. Loved it!",1429833600,18,359,4.454545454545454
