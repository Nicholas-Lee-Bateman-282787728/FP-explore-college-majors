419366,3,6302035449,"I liked this movie since I first saw it too many years ago. I had an old VHS copy that was in poor shape that I would watch whenever I needed a little cheese. You know, bad dialogue and questionable plot. I always liked the music and the racing wasn't bad, although much slower than the real thing. I knew there was another ""european"" ending and this DVD has it. I wish I had never seen it. The other ending takes a tolerable bit of entertainment and turns it into crap. I would guess that the makers didn't know how to end it so they did this. What a waste. Unfortunately both endings are here but you have to watch the european version as the American endind is just tacked on afterwards.",1310256000,2,690,4.234848484848484
419367,5,6302035449,"I use to watch this movie all the time on cable back in the 80s. But i forgot the name of the movie. I figureed out one of the actors names Beau Bridges. and did a seach on his name and found the moive.

this is good underdog moive and motorcycle mouive",1291939200,,253,3.8653846153846154
419368,2,6302035449,"This is one of those movies that you can tell while watching it, that you know you're seeing something bad. But I continued to watch. Only to be completely ""blown away"" by the horrible ending. What a waste. I basically watched the entire movie to get the big race at the end, and I'll admit that I was slightly more interested in the characters at this point, so what do they do? KILL the star, and thus, the relationship with the girl. If your into torture, or a laugh then rent it.",1065744000,2,483,4.260869565217392
419369,5,6302035449,"Quite a while since I first saw the film but having been to see David Essex live a couple of days ago when he sang the title track - it evoked memories of what an excellent ""biker"" film this was.  It was a classic for its time - the race scenes were excellent and David portrayed the part par excellence.
The ending was unexpected and very dramatic - it leaves a constant memory for what was a brilliant film.",1034553600,3,409,4.177215189873418
419370,3,6302035449,"Read this review with the understanding that I first saw this movie as a 12-year old at my local cinema around 1980. And then I went to go and see it another four times in the week after that. At that time, this movie just blew me away with its motorbike race scenes - and I also wasn't puked out by the romance sub-plot either - which is saying something for a 12-year old. The sight of David Essex zipping around the track on that gorgeous silver bike - and the sad conclusion to the movie -was enough to create a warm memory of the movie for me. I'll probably see it today and be able to intellectually accept its hokiness, but sentimentally - hey, it's a good memory from my youth so I'll probably buy it for my Guilty Pleasures collection (alongside An Officer and a Gentleman and Against All Odds).",980208000,11,804,4.296052631578948

419488,4,6302035449,"I saw this movie back in the 1990's, the movie is pretty good, but definitely is a British movie. However , the version I saw before ended differently! Still as a motorcyclist , its pretty good entertainment.",1403568000,,208,4.648648648648648
419489,4,6302035449,As a past video store owner I've seen this movie more than 20 times in VHS mode. I will say I was more than a little surprised to watch this tonight and find that there was an alternate ending that I'd never seen before.

7820303,5,6302035449,"Classic motogp movie which use to be my favourite. But still cant understand the reason for killing the main character because it gives you nothing but just a sympathy. Your connection with the character gets lost. But anyway, it was a good memory watching this movie",1436745600,,267,4.826086956521739
