8724318,2,B011ID128Q,"Mike ( Jesse Bradford) is a good cop and his partner David (Lochlyn Monroe) is not so good. During a drug bust Mike accidentally shoots a 15 year old kid. David devises a cover-up by planting a gun on the kid and claiming he shot first. Jessica (Mena Suvari)  is called in to do an internal investigation which lasts the whole picture with not much complexity.

The problem I had with the film is that if the kid shot at the police, there would be a bullet in the wall from that gun. They didn't even check, something that would make this an open and shut case. Instead Jessica must solve the case using hypothetical evidence.

The acting was decent. The script was bad.
