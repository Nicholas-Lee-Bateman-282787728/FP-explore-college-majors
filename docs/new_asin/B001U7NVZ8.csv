The seventh season of this series aired in the second half of 1993.  It is notable for a number of reasons, the most obvious being that it marked the end of an era in terms of the overall tone and look of the show.  Starting with the show's eighth season, which aired the following year, nearly all the hallmarks of the show - all the touchstones that made the series what it was - would be gone.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let us break down the seventh season of the show.

The first 13 episodes of the seventh season are what fans have dubbed the ""European Vacation"" shows.  These episodes have always been a bit of a mystery among fans, if only because, in some aspects of the story, they seem to be out of place in the seventh season.  During the first episode of the fourth season, the Turtles find out that they have won a vacation to Europe.  So, it would stand to reason that the first leg of season four would be the Turtles' adventures traveling across Europe.  This they do; some of the storylines take place in France, Greece, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Turkey.  Along the way, familiar characters (Shredder and Krang), and some not so familiar (Erik the Red Eye, a modern-day Viking), attempt various nefarious schemes at taking over the world.  Many theories abound as to why this fourth season storyline did not see the light of day until the beginning of the seventh season (animation and/or scheduling problems being the most popular), but at least fans can rest easy that all of the ""European Vacation"" episodes have finally made it to DVD.

That being said, however, the end of the ""European Vacation"" episodes and the ""beginning"" of the seventh season can be a bit jarring when viewing the shows in succession.  While the aforementioned episodes run parallel to the themes, tone and overall look of the show during its third and fourth seasons, the remaining 14 episodes mark a stark contrast to them.

By the time 1993 rolled around, Saturday morning cartoons were changing.  Light and fluffy were out; dark and edgy were in.  The ""beginning"" of the seventh season (after the ""European Vacation"" episodes) marked a trial run into this territory.  Episodes were a bit darker in theme than they had been in seasons past, but not so much that what made the show great in the first place - humor, pizza references, and terrific characters - was lost.  It wasn't until the eighth season that the show went whole hog and introduced a completely revamped (darker and edgier) premise, virtually dropping everything fans had come to know and love about the series.

The first foray in this experiment was ""Night of the Dark Turtle,"" a fabulous episode that sees Donatello temporarily explore a darker side to his personality.  Everything about this episode works: terrific humor, great action sequences, outstanding animation, and rocking background music.  ""Night of the Dark Turtle"" is not only a highlight of the seventh season, but it represents one of the best episodes of the entire series.

Something that is not a highlight, however, is the loss of James Avery (""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"") halfway through the season as the voice of Shredder.  From the beginning of the series, James Avery managed to make Shredder a three-dimensional character, as opposed to a run-of-the-mill, one-note, cardboard cutout that most villains on cartoons encapsulate.  Shredder could be scary, for sure, as a typical bad guy; but he could also be quite hilarious, and Avery breathed much life into the role.  Many fans view Shredder and Krang as a married couple because of the amount of bickering they do with each other.  The improvisations that both actors brought to their roles created lasting characters that fans loved, even though they were villains.  After Avery left the show for reasons unknown, the voice actor who replaced him did absolutely nothing with the Shredder role except to play it as a stereotypical, one-dimensional bad guy.  To say that James Avery was missed as the seventh season came to a close is a vast understatement.

THE DVD SET

To celebrate the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 25th anniversary (somehow, Young Adult Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn't have quite the same ring to it), Lionsgate has decided to do something a little different with the release of the seventh season.  It has been broken up into four parts, or slices, and each Turtle has one.  When combined the four slices fit together to create one scene on your DVD shelf.

But the surprises don't stop there.  Each DVD slice will also include an original Ninja Turtles toy from Playmates, the toy company that produced the classic Turtle toys all through the show's run.  I may not always like the DVD releases Lionsgate comes up with for this show, but the fact that they have pulled out some major stops to celebrate the show's 25th anniversary is commendable and has me eagerly anticipating May 12, 2009.

Side note: only the most die-hard of fans will notice this, but it is worth pointing out: in the original cartoon series, the Turtle with the orange bandana was always known as Michaelangelo.  When the new cartoon aired in 2003, the spelling was changed to Michelangelo.  It looks like Lionsgate has decided to go with the second spelling of Mikey's name for this DVD set.  Even though I find this annoying, it's a minor quibble.",1236470400,5,7545,4.860501567398119

I loved this season because they focused on characters other then just Shredder and Krang. The stories also weren't bad at all. The Don disk has some great ones on it.

This is worth it for sure. It's only 7 episodes again but they're good episodes. The only downside is the special features are still very bad.",1246060800,2,458,4.518072289156627
