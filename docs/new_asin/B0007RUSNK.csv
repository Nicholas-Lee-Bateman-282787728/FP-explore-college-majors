2239068,5,B0007RUSNK,"I used to watch this show every week. It was funny,it had drama,it had a dancing baby,I mean really. Totally 90's.",1358726400,,114,4.476190476190476
2239069,5,B0007RUSNK,I loved the stories and the episodes with Josh Grobin and Robert Downy Jr. Many stories I found myself laughing out loud and thought this was really good for me.,1350691200,2,161,4.4
2239070,5,B0007RUSNK,"Great season and love Robert Downey Jr on the show.  I really did not watch the show before he was on it but loved the chemistry between him and Calista.  So sad he could not stay sober so they could get married.  Also, love Peter MacNichol, he is so cute and funny.  Very glad they finally came out on DVD and worth purchasing.",1339113600,,328,4.158730158730159
2239071,5,B0007RUSNK,"This season is great. Richard's phrases are so funny! Really you have to get it. This is the first time that Ally knows a good guy and he actually loves her.

John is great too.

My season arrives at time.",1337990400,,205,4.1
2239072,5,B0007RUSNK,"I became a fan of this show with this season thanks in large part to the special season appearance of Robert Downey Jr.  His portral of Larry Paul, a new attorney at the law firm, was both charismatic and tender at the same time.  He is a natural in this part.  His banter with Ally is endearing, his interaction with John and the other attorneys is at times hilarious and at other times artful in his delivery of quick witted comebacks and stellar observations.  The season brings us full circle with the relationships Larry has with the entire cast, and by the season finale, you want him to be there for season five.  I won't spoil anything, but be prepared with a box of Kleenex for some of these episodes which deal with love, loss, and separation, not necessarily in that order.
Aside from loving every episode featuring Larry Paul, guest star Anne Heche was sweet and quirky in a continuous story line that featured a very special homeless man, a magical apartment, and an affinity for Mr. Cage.  But my stand out favorite was The Getaway where John and Richard attempt a weekend trip to L.A.  What ensues from the moment they arrive at the airport till they reach California will split your sides.....one of the funniest shows of the entire season.

More than any other television series, Ally McBeal gave new meaning to finding a soundtrack to your life.  The Barry White visions and songs by Sting and Manilow added to the healing power of music this season.

I loved this show for its odd characters, special guests, deeper themes and often heartfelt messages of hope amidst personal despair.  It found a way to be clever, sometimes irreverent but always funny.  The music played throughout always hits a nerve with what has gone on in that particular episode.  If you've seen the show up till this season but didn't totally love it, I recommend this season four to win you over.",1336608000,10,1890,4.63963963963964

2239074,5,B0007RUSNK,"I'm really pleased with the dvds, I've been wanting to get them for a long time and when I got the chance I did! they are great and I got them really fast.",1318809600,,155,3.727272727272727
2239075,5,B0007RUSNK,"Ally McBeal's fourth season is one the best of the series. Ally has finally found her soulmate in Larry Paul. Robert Downey, Jr.s turn as Larry is the highlight of the season if not the series. You also get to see what happens when Ally get to be in charge, while the senior partners Cage & Fish take a ""vacation"" in L.A. Ling and Renee fall for the same man. Elaine gets a new boyfriend, but in Elaine fashion, may not get to keep him. You also get to see Nell's father, who really believes he is Santa Claus.",1289865600,18,510,4.161616161616162

2239095,5,B0007RUSNK,"I was too happy to find this on my Amazon and I started with Season 4.  I was almost through it, when it suddenly became ""Unavailable"".  Then I noticed that all the seasons were listed the same ...""Unavailable"".  What happened????  You hook me and then take it away??",1390348800,,267,4.5

2239107,5,B0007RUSNK,Ally McBeal is a great show with quircky characters you can fall in love with.  I thinks its great the way they can show their own personal problems and have a sense of humor while they work through their issues together.,1389139200,,221,4.390243902439025
2239108,3,B0007RUSNK,"This show was getting a bit stale and frustrating. Robert Downey Jr. helps...by playing the same character he plays in ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" and ""Iron Man"" ... It's okay, but Georgia's gone, Rene has been demoted to backup singer, and for some reason, Nelle is still around. Normally, I like cast shakeups, but this time it isn't enough to save this show from getting repetitive. Ally never seems to grow -- she continues to exhibit all of the relationship-ending neuroses and habits she always does. Grow up!",1388880000,,510,4.806818181818182
2239109,5,B0007RUSNK,I watched Ally McBeal years ago and am now watching in sequence.  season 4 has been my favorite.  Not ready for it to end! Robert Downey and Ally make a great couple.,1388534400,,166,4.15625
2239110,5,B0007RUSNK,"What can I say, it's Ally McBeal! They wrote a fun show with this one, and it's great to revisit. I also love that they have lots of music with this one.  Second time around is definitely more fun!",1388361600,,197,4.051282051282051
2239111,5,B0007RUSNK,"This was one of the best shows ever.  Smart, funny, quirky with excellent actors and writing.
I loved every season.  The fourth season had the added bonus of Robert Downy Jr.  I wish he could have been in more seasons.",1387497600,,218,4.4
2239112,5,B0007RUSNK,"I've watched this whole TV series from the very first episode and loved every minute of it!  It's SO funny, and I love Vonda Shepherd adn Barry White's songs in the show!  Will have a blast watching it over and over again!  Thx for the opportunity to have this for my very own!!  :)",1384560000,,282,4.166666666666667
2239113,5,B0007RUSNK,"Adore her, she is so very talante. Watched every season when it first aired , then again now.
I see things I've missed before. She plays that role to the max' I'm laughing,  crying, and sometimes angry. There will never be another show I've loved like this one. I was very sorry to  see the series end. I feel  looks I know her in so many ways.

Sincerely,
Sue",1383868800,,360,4.173913043478261

2239115,5,B0007RUSNK,"While the 1st and 2nd seasons are still the champs, the 4th season in my opinion brings back a lot of the spunk it had when it lost Billy. I loved the transvestite character, Cyndi and that whole relationship with Mark seemed very real. Also loved Anne Heche's guest appearances! The ending of this season is so sad to me because I know it was Downey Jr's personal life and personal drug habit (which he hadnt kicked yet) that forced his character to leave the show and sent the 5th season into a disorganized tailspin.",1383091200,,519,4.473684210526316
2239126,5,B0007RUSNK,"I love Allie!!! I watch all the shows, none of the new comedys compare with hers. I watched all ther time when they were on the air, but enjoy them agaim now",1383091200,,157,3.9375
2239127,5,B0007RUSNK,I enjoyed this season of Ally McBeal so much that I didn't want it to end.  The crazy antics of the law firm members were endlessly entertaining.  Great concept to have a unisex bathroom.,1382659200,,187,4.470588235294118

2239129,5,B0007RUSNK,Loved Robert Downing Jr. with Ally.  Too bad he is not in all of them.  The Biscuit is also great in this season.,1381795200,,113,3.869565217391304
2239130,5,B0007RUSNK,It has been the best season to me!  Ally and Larry have such chemistry together.  I watch it as I exercise.  It keeps me motivated and I look forward to watching it each day.,1379721600,2,174,4.0588235294117645
2239131,3,B0007RUSNK,"Great in the beginning, gets worse after season 4. Writing went down to disaster with ""silly"" predictable shock theater junk.",1379462400,,125,5.3
2239132,4,B0007RUSNK,"Let;'s face it, by the forth season, Ally McBeal was beginning to run out of steam.  Robert Downey Jr. brought that back and made it relevant again.  A great loss when he left.",1378252800,,176,4.303030303030303
2239133,5,B0007RUSNK,"for my money,best season of all. Robert downing junior made the season.  ally still looking for a spot on the show,but,the rest of the cast is perfect. very entertaining and silly humor.",1377734400,,186,4.8125

2239135,4,B0007RUSNK,"When this series was on, I didn't watch it  -- too busy, too many other shows to watch - whatever.  But recently I viewed a couple of episodes on Amazon Prime with Josh Groban and found the show highly entertaining and amusing.  So much so that I've added all seasons to my watch list and plan to view them all.  The talent on the show is really great and it has a good sense of humor in the storylines.  Given some of the series that are on network TV now, this series is more appealing now than it was originally.",1375574400,,515,4.11
2239136,5,B0007RUSNK,"Love it! Continued Depth of character, emotional connection, understand the conflict, confusion and lack of clarity. Humor is even better.",1375228800,,138,5.95

2239139,5,B0007RUSNK,"I love season 4 of Ally McBeal....I won't give away anything, but I loved watching the story unfold as Ally entered into a deeper relationship.

2239142,3,B0007RUSNK,"Oh, Ally.  Why did you stoop to the lame ""tricks"" and the insistent rotation of actors?  The early seasons were fresh and interesting.  The others... not so much.

Robert Downey Jr part Larry and Ally McBeal Calista Flockhart was so good you could feel their chemistry they had a connection so it seemed from day one... I know they are actors but the still had something special on screen and wondrous to watch it was fun to see the wit and personality of Robert Downey Jr it was sad that he was removed from the show, I understand why and it is great Robert got his act together and is back ,, NOw I am watching from the beginning it has been fun to watch the different people on the show.",1361577600,,620,4.090163934426229

8051073,5,B0007RUSNK,The series seems to have regained its stride with the addition of Robert Downey Jr. since he is one actor who can hold his own against Flockhart.  The only problem is that once he became incarcerated the show again suffered from that loss.  Adding additional characters only work when the series still remains focused on the primary character and everyone else should just be used as support around Ally.,1454889600,,404,4.840579710144928
8051074,5,B0007RUSNK,My favorite season of Ally McBeal. Very pleased with this purchase. Item arrived on time and just as described .,1446681600,,112,4.65
8051075,5,B0007RUSNK,"I will easily admit that I love Robert Downey Jr.  I will also honestly admit that Ally McBeal, prior to this season, had completely gotten on my nerves.  However, something about the addition of Larry Paul to the cast really changed things around for me.  His character makes Ally more palatable, and the storylines, while still insane, were also easier to take and enjoy.  I know there are a lot that will argue that Season 1 is the best season; however, I think Season 4 is the one that really made the show.  It's unfortunate that Downey's drug issues pulled him from the show because it was the beginning of an immediate and steep decline of this show.",1436054400,,657,4.533898305084746
