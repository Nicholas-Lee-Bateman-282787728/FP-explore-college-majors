6454924,1,B00KZKWQLG,"It is impossible to like any of these characters. Harrison is a grown child, but he does have a good business sense. His parents and friends seem to love publicly humiliating him, mocking him and brushing off any of his ideas for their business which is going under. Their behavior is so bad you can understand why he doesn't come home I wouldn't want to spend time with these people either. The preacher openly mocks him during service for Christ sakes. Every gift that he has ever sent to his family through the years was not only not used, but was put away in the garage unopened, still in the wrapping paper. I get that the moral to this movie is that family is important and you should support the people you love but it missed the mark. Everyone is a huge jerk in their own right, cold and rude. This lasts until there is 10 minutes left in the movie and it's like everyone drinks the cool-aid and is looking for a group hug and songs around the campfire. The switch happens so quickly it can only be called creepy and appears drug induced. Suzie, who is the love interest, use to date Harrison and is now dating Rick. Harrison and Rick spend the whole movie fighting each other, trying to prove who is the better guy for Suzie who is painfully obnoxious. At the end Rick and Harrison, despite spending their whole lives hating each other and Rick messing up a flyer that Harrison made to boost sales for the family company, decide to apologize to each other... out of the blue. They both want to be friends. Then Harrison wishes Suzie and Rick the best with their future. Suzie says she has changed her mind saying she wants to go back to Harrison, and Rick is completely fine with this. Ever wonder what it would look like if a schizophrenic wrote a movie? Or want to try acid but don't want to deal with the 8 hour high and the idea of seeing your floor melt isn't appealing... then this movie is for you! Because for a 1 1/2 hours you will be asking yourself what is going on!??!?!?!?!?!",1411948800,,1997,4.370967741935484

6454928,4,B00KZKWQLG,"Wall Street executive Harrison Burke (Mark Salling) is living large in the Big Apple. Until he's laid off, that is. Jobless, homeless, friendless, and burdened by debt, his only recourse is to go back home to mom and dad's place in a small New Hampshire town he had been determined to leave behind. Cocky and proud, and desperately hoping his situation is temporary, Harrison hides the truth from his parents and his former employer. Soon enough he slides back into adolescence, wasting his days playing video games, until his father puts him to work -- back on the family ice cream truck he drove in high school.

I'm really beginning to love films like Rocky Road  that employ a small but talented and engaging cast to relate a simple message. Equally equipped to play the swaggering go-getter and the disarmingly charming guy next store, Mark Salling is perfectly cast. Salling especially shines during comedic moments, recalling the comic talents of a young Brendan Fraser. Nicholas Campbell brings such realism to the role of Ben Burke that you'd swear the guy has spent years breaking his back selling ice cream. And Deborah Tennant is lovably quirky in her role as Harrison's mother Marla. Perhaps because her current passion is serving meals exclusively on sticks, your first impression is that she's affectionate but clueless. As it turns out, she and dad are both more savvy than you think! Lastly, whether it be the cantankerous neighbor down the street, the town Reverend, the teenager in his father's employ, or his old high-school sweetheart, the rest of the assembled cast are a collective joy to behold.

Rocky Road chronicles Harrison Burke's journey toward self-awareness. He learns to enjoy and appreciate the quieter, slower pace of small-town life. While driving the truck, Harrison learns -- through mistakes and missteps -- that life is about more than dollars and cents. In addition to finding that he and his father have much in common, Harrison realizes that financially-strapped Dad is wealthier by far than any Wall Street climber. For the true measure of a man is found not in the depth of his pockets or the size of his expensive account, but in immeasurable riches like family, friendship, faith, service, and love.

Verdict: 4 of 5 Hearts. Sweet, Summer Feel-Good Fun. Whether or not you're a fan of Fox's Glee, you'll enjoy this charming, heartfelt UP TV original film and the lessons it imparts through humor and ice cream. With Rocky Road, husband and wife team Neal and Tippi Dobrofsky (whose recent writing credits include Hallmark Channel's When Calls the Heart) have scripted a sincere, humble, never preachy treat that will melt even the hardest of hearts!",1410048000,4,2696,4.984444444444445
6454929,4,B00KZKWQLG,"If you're in need of some lighthearted, escapist, non-stressful entertainment, then this romantic comedy fits the bill with a family friendly, 'get back to what's important in life' story.

Harrison(Mark Salling, 'Glee'), who used to be Harry, lives the fast, flashy high life in New York City.  He's got the car, the clothes. the pad and the job.  Until the boss downsizes the business, and Harry's now broke and out on the street.  He heads to his parent's home in bucolic New Hampshire, where he finds his old room has changed, his dad forces him to drive an ice cream truck for the small time family business, and his old high school sweetheart(Rebecca Dalton), whom he left 8 years ago, has moved on to her own life and love- without him.

Of course, we know where all this is going, but they do it in a fun, touching and cute way with romance and a gentle, moral tale.  The town folk and parents are a bit quirky but supportive, and, of course, doing the right thing and love will win
 out.

This production company also did 'Dear Viola' of similar ilk, filmed in Canada, good production values and actors, nice scenery, and a well written, predictable, storyline. Plus, everyone in town goes to church.  If you enjoy this genre, as we so much do, you won't be disappointed with this 'flavor'.

Probably a G rating, our little ones get bored with these: too romantic, no animals.  Nice film after a tough week at work or too many horror films, action thrillers and soaps, hope they make more.",1409875200,3,1498,4.573033707865169

6454946,3,B00KZKWQLG,"If this is Mark Salling's first sally into film projects, post-Glee, he needed to be more awesome in his decision making. Rocky Road is a family film that presents okay watchability, except it mostly misses the mark due to lazy writing and shallow characterization. Salling plays smug Wall Street trader Harrison Burke whose firm lays him off due to downsizing. So there's the spoiled 30-somethin' hotshot leaving behind the Big Apple bustle for an ignoble bus ride back to his hometown. There, he ends up at his parents' and toiling for his dad's failing ice cream truck business. A paper hat awaits the prodigal son.

Can Harrison get over his big city snobbery? Can he rekindle romance with his high school sweetheart Suzie (Rebecca Dalton) with whom he hadn't spoken in eight years? It'll be a tough go because Suzie is seeing his old lawyery rival and isn't about to fall again for Harrison's smarmy sort of charm. And can Harrison rescue the family business and earn approbation from his disapproving dad (Nicholas Campbell), never mind that he's the son who never gave his parents grand-children? And how many Sundays in a row can he attend church? Because the community has a betting pool going.

This baby recycles a crap ton of small town tropes, so hunker down, Betty. Rocky Road premiered on the UP(lifting) channel on Sunday, July 20, 2014, which happened to be National Ice Cream Day in America, so that's neat. Also neat is that Mark Salling wrote and recorded the song, ""Back at the Starting Line,"" specifically for the film. It's a wise choice for Salling to take on a character that veers away from his bad boy role in Glee. Now, I sort of want to stop here because I do like Salling and what's next is essentially my crapping on the movie.

An unimpressed 2.5 out of 5 stars for this oned. I feel that it's just an okay movie. The actors give it a go but are thwarted by a script that sucks ass. The wiseacre reverend may well be the film's most refreshing character (loved the sermon in which he picks on Harrison). And Salling, when he delivers his series of Oy-I-have-turned-my-life-around speeches, isn't very convincing. There's this line he gives in one rally speech - and it goes: ""At the risk of sounding corny, sometimes the best road is the rocky road home."" - that made me wince because he's right, it did sound corny. At least, Salling's sneaky courtship of Rebecca Dalton is something to root for. Moving on, at first, I wasn't predisposed to like his parents (Nicholas Campbell, Deborah Tennant), they who never even bothered to open any of the gifts he'd sent them. You do feel bad for Harrison when he finds this out. So, it turns out, Papa Burke is resistant to change. It's partly why his ice cream truck enterprise had been flagging so. It's a given, natch, that Harrison would arrive at these newfangled ideas to improve on the product, and maybe mom's penchant for cooking up delish meals on sticks would come into play. See Rocky Road if you're a Mark Salling fan or if your remote is stuck on the UP channel or if you're in humor for a very vanilla movie about a guy who learns to appreciate the charm and values of a small town. Or you could just rent Doc Hollywood. Or Northern Exposure. Or Country Remedy. Or Finding Normal. Or Hallmark's Christmas Under Wraps.",1425427200,,3306,4.638225255972697
