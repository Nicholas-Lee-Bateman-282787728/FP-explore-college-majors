7833280,5,6302994438,"This is an excellent survey of Wright and the history of his architectural works. I consider it superior to the PBS work by Ken Burns. It is enhanced by his grand-daughter, Anne Baxter's narration.  It is extremely unfortunate it is not available on DVD. By now most of the video tapes are lost or in poor condition even if anyone still has a VHS machine to play it on. The tape I received was in good condition with only a few video glitches. Any serious student of Wright's work should try to view this documentary.",1392681600,,517,4.442105263157894
