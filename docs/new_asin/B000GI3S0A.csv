2613747,5,B000GI3S0A,"It's no secret what the tragedy for Macario will be.  We know something terrible will happen and why, what we are not familiar with is the journey to that destiny.  Macario is the face of hundreds of immigrants from Central America who have only wanted to make better for their families when the work is no longer available in their country.  The immigrants are not just names in the local papers, they are real people, humans with problems, dreams and hopes and a desire to earn for their families.

Director Pablo Velez was 23 with a need to make a film to tell the story that so many other people in his life were touched by some tragedy of those who wanted to cross the border, to work for a living, to provide for their families.

What Velez has done is draw upon the human side of immigrants, not the gory, he not the dramatic, nor the violent nor criminal.  He shows us the face of Macario, a young man with a wife who already doesn't have enough for a dinner with meat.  But we see him with great anxiety, trepidation enough to pray in the church before he makes that trip knowing he could not come back.  With the slower pace of the film, the viewer has time to feel the fear for him.

You will hear some wonderful Mexican music, and here, with subtitles, it is an extension of interpreting the story for the viewer.  Often with music in foreign film, the translation is not available, but here it is important.

According to an article in the Austin Chronicle, writer Joe O'Connell's interview with Velez states:

During early showings in San Antonio, Veliz saw grown men cry. ""I never present America as Satan,"" he says. ""This tragic event was created by two nations that call each other friends. It's not political; I'm making a human statement.""

2613749,1,B000GI3S0A,"The movie was of poor quality. When the DVD was filmed, it wasn't a clear picture. the movie had alot of pauses in it. The color was both dark and to much green in it. I won't order anymore DVD's like that anymore.",1202169600,,214,4.0
2613750,4,B000GI3S0A,"Directed and written by Pablo Vliz, this film succeeds not because it is an excellent film, but because it does a sufficient job in humanizing an important political and ethical issue of our day-- illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States. Macario is an illiterate laborer who loses his job when the farmer who employees him sells his land and fires all his workers. He's an eminently likable character, as is his lovely wife, and together they are tired of starvation wages. When by fate Macario comes into enough money, he and his friend Felipe decide to cross the border into San Antonio. They pay a ""coyote"" to take them across, but when they show up for the trip he herds a dozen of them into a locked and unventilated freight car. Tragedy awaits these passengers, the coyote, and even the Mexican farmer who sold his land. Based upon a true story. In Spanish with English subtitles.",1177286400,33,899,4.69620253164557
2613751,5,B000GI3S0A,"This film touches my heart. I love everything about it; the acting, editing, the soundtrack, the script, the cinematography, even the film grain and the at times washed out, inconsistent colors (technical problems with the DVD transfer maybe). It is easy when discussing illegal immigration to think in general, abstract terms, but this film focuses existential, social, political, religious and ethical issues by involving us in the lives of a few individuals who are struggling to LIVE. It is a beautiful film, a piece of art. Everytime I watch this film my eyes fill with tears.",1171065600,10,581,5.0625
8132622,4,B000GI3S0A,Sad story about the horrors Mexican immigrants endure when illegally crossing the border into the USA. The gut wrenching scene of the people locked in the tractor trailer suffocating due to the lack of air and heat were gut wrenching.,1505347200,,234,4.875

8132624,2,B000GI3S0A,"I bought this movie to show to my high school class in order to give them a better understanding of the plight of immigrants to this country.  While the movie may do this to some extent, the terrible ""creative"" directing (constantly blurry closeups of unimportant objects; terrible editing and picture quality) and insincere acting distract from this message.  The flow of the movie was constantly interrupted by music that told the viewer exactly what would happen next.  I barely made it through watching this movie.  If any tears were going to flow, they would have been from boredom.  I would never be able to get an entire class of high schoolers to sit through this movie without complaint.",1469059200,,696,4.864406779661017

8132627,1,B000GI3S0A,"La mayor tragedia de esta pelicula es que jamas se haya hecho. Ver esta pelicula es como observar pintura secarse sobre una pared. Sabes que algo sucedio pero al final no sabras cuando, a pesar de mirar atentamente. Hagase el favor amigo y evite esta pelicula. Una buena pelicula sobre este tema es Espiral.

The worst tragegy about this film is that it was ever made. There is not much of a plot, aside from the obvious. There is ABSOLUTELY no character development since the script only calls from the actors to speak for literally moments at a time. Perphaps, worst of all, conversations by the actors are interspersed by long and tedious songs. I really, REALLY wanted to like this film after seeing Espiral which I highly recommend but this film was a huge disappointment. This is the type of film where if someone gave it to you for free, you'd still feel ripped off after watching it.",1326585600,2,891,4.60377358490566

It is a very good movie from the point of view that is a real fact movie and it shows things that maybe we never imagined about the immigration, If you would like to see this one please watch it like the real fact that it is and not looking for awesome effects that just don't let anything in your mind to think about it. Lo mejor de todo para la gente latina es que esta en Espaol :)",1294617600,,512,3.923076923076923
