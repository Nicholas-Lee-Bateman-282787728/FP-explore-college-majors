8092902,5,B000BUICWC,"THE AFTER HOURS remains just as fresh and effective as when it was first aired on June 10, 1960 and its lingering haunting imagery remains engraved into one's subconscious. Who can ever forget Anne Francis as Marsha. Her impeccable performance and exquisite face are indelible. ""Marsha"" that very name and the way it was repeated over and over was so eerily unsettling sending chills down one's spine. This episode when compared to WALKING DISTANCE demonstrates the great versatility of Rod Serling as a writer. WALKING DISTANCE is probably the best prose that Serling ever penned where every bit of dialogue was so heartfelt and moving. In THE AFTER HOURS Serling gives us a more visual tale where the storytelling is more dependent on the images. Serling gives us a story of two strikingly opposite worlds that co-exist within a department store. The vivid contrast and the realistic depiction of those two worlds is at the core of this story that has a strange tinge of melancholy about it. Thanks to effective lighting, production design, photography, Douglas Heyes' Direction and impeccable acting it succeeds on all levels and is one of the definitive episodes of the series.

In TIME ENOUGH AT LAST a bank teller brilliantly played by Burgess Meredith is a man whose nearsighted-ness is only matched by his preoccupation with reading. Becoming the only survivor of a devastating H-bomb catastrophe he is finally able to pursue his only real passion in life: reading and then more reading. Rod Serling's story interestingly juxtaposes the ultra-introverted world that Burgess Meredith has created for himself with a New World truly void of those human interruptions that would otherwise interrupt his self-imposed solitude. Due to a twist of fate however, the viewer must ponder how will he ever survive? `TIME ENOUGH AT LAST' first aired on November 20, 1959.

THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD is a very sentimental and somehow forgotten episode with Donald Pleasence as a school professor who is asked to step down and retire. I really like this one. This is one of Rod Serling's best scripts. It was directed by Chris Nyby.

THE MONSTERS ARE DUE ON MAPLE STREET is a real classic episode and a great study in mas hysteria, paranoia and misplaced value for self preservation. In this episode written by Rod Serling, we see a tranquil suburban neighborhood  turned upside down by a power failure that they suspect is being caused by alien invaders disguised as earthlings. One great feature of this episode is its powerful cast that includes Claude Akins, Jack Weston, Barry Atwater, Jan Handzlik and Ben Erway. This is a very good one.",1379808000,,2636,4.984090909090909
