8236301,4,B000ZPPS02,"If ""condition"" truly means nothing to you, then you'll love seeing this rare Bing Crosby title.  Truthfully, and in light of today's amazing technology, I fail to understand why any video company would release a video in this condition.  This aside, you may want to purchase this only to see Douglas Fairbanks ""swash"" his way through this vintage opus in addition to seeing a very young (yet hardly sober) Bing Crosby croon as only he knew how.",1337990400,,444,4.753246753246753
8236302,4,B000ZPPS02,"Ever heard of Wienerworld Classics?  Me either, but I took a chance on this economy-priced Bing Crosby double feature for Edmund Goulding's 'Reaching for the Moon' (1931) and am glad I did.  If you aren't familiar with the film, RFTM is a very early, strange and starkly funny pre-code screwball comedy starring impish Douglas Fairbanks Sr. as a socially inept Wall Street shark who finds himself in love-- and out of his element-- as the stock market is about to crash famously in '29.  E. Everett Horton is cast perfectly as Fairbanks' butler/romantic adviser and the pair make an absurdly effective team; Crosby appears briefly to sing an Irving Berlin song.  Wienerworld's print of RFTM, while not remastered and showing all sorts of specks and scratches, boasts a much sharper picture and clearer sound than the awful Passport DVD in circulation.

First-billed of the double feature, 'The Road to Hollywood,' is simply a 50-minute retrospective of the singer's rise to movie stardom compiled in 1946, and while there is some amusing and rare footage of him crooning, it provides little in terms of insight or information.  Overall, I'd be hard-pressed to call this release a must-have for Crosby aficionados, but it's a great value for fans of RFTM.  3 1/2 stars for the package.",1304380800,3,1284,4.97196261682243
