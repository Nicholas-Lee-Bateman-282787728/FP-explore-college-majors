7793620,5,0956310141,Very good DVD.  Instruction is clear and helpful is getting the practitioner through the movements.  I felt comfortable about what I was doing by the end of the DVD.  I also have the book.  The two compliment each other.,1401148800,,220,4.564102564102564
7793621,1,0956310141,"Did not puchase from Amazon, (shame on me) bit purchased directly from the teacher/producer.  NO tutorial provided, just a follow along cd and he moves real fast.  No talk of theory or mindset while doing the movements.

Should have bought it from Amazon cause I would return it in a heartbeat.  Dont buy it",1400716800,6,307,4.62962962962963
7793622,5,0956310141,Very good with and good description. All the concerted actions are described very well. The DVD was in good condition,1362009600,,117,4.9
7793623,5,0956310141,"Shi Yan Lei has made the Eight Treasures form straight forward and fun to learn.  He gives a preparation to the form.  He breaks down the steps, incorporating the breathing.  He shows Shaolin Vinyasa, meditation with helpful hints on how to customize for your own needs.  This DVD includes videos of different training he teaches at the Shaolin Temple UK, where he co-works with the famous pugilist, Grandmaster Yan Zi.  The form is powerful with holding the low stances, if you're not ready do it this way, you can make adjustments and build up your strength.  Anything is possible!!  Just do it!!

Inspirational and spectacular.  I would highly recommend this item and any other merchandise from Shi Yan Lei.",1358812800,,710,4.899159663865547
7793624,1,0956310141,"As the product description states, this is yet another variant of the ""8 Treasures"", or ""Eight Pieces of Brocade""...and not a very good one at that.  There are much better DVD versions of this qigong sequence.

In Yan Lei's version, much of the time the arms/hands and legs/feet are out of  the shot, so you really have no idea what is going on, or how to execute properly.

An additional weakness of this DVD is that the talk-through voiceover is extremely sparse.  There is relatively little cueing, so you will find yourself still working on one posture while Yan Lei has already moved on to the next.

Thirdly, there is a fairly aggressive warm-up section at the beginning of the DVD that is somewhat antithetical to the intent of qigong practice.  The idea behind qigong practice is certainly NOT to overheat or overstretch the musculature and ligaments of the body.

If you are looking for an excellent representation of the ""8 Treasures"" or ""Eight Pieces of Brocade"" the much better value is Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's version:  Eight Simple Qigong Exercises for Health (The Eight Pieces of Brocade).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eight-Simple-Qigong-Exercises-for-Health-The-Eight-Pieces-of-Brocade/dp/1886969523/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eight Simple Qigong Exercises for Health: The Eight Pieces of Brocade</a>",1333756800,13,1355,5.701492537313433
7793625,5,0956310141,"Having practiced the Eight Silken Brocade from Shifu Lei's ""Instant Health Qi Gong"" and the related DVD, ""Shaolin Warrior - Way of Qi Gong vol. 1"" I was intrigued to take on vol. 3.  I was not dissappointed.

Having very little experience with qi gong beyond attending a brief seminar and learning the Five Animal Frolic from an accupuncturist, I have relied heavily upon the forms taught by Shifu Lei.

Vol. 3, Muscle Tendon Changing, Bone Marrow Clensing Classic, is by far my favorite form of all.  It does take a bit of time to learn the form which comes in three sections, but the effort is well worth it!  Shifu Lei first demonstrates the complete form to some really motivating kind of music, and he sets out to demonstrate the forms of each set again followed by step-by-step instructions.  If you are like me, you will need to watch it over and over again to get it.  However, once the body begins to assimulate the movements, you must focus more on the coordination of the breathing while keeping the mind free.  A tall, tall task.

One caution, you do need the explanation of terms he uses.  He unfortunately does not explain this in vol. 3, but rather does this in vol. 2 (since, both forms contain Bone Marrow Clensing Classic).  Therefore, if you rely on just watching vol. 3, you will probably not be holding each movement for the proper amount of time, since there is some inconsistency on his part when he is speaking.  For that reason, I strongly suggest if you have the cash, buy vol. 2 as well (I haven't really put that much effort into learning this form, yet).

Finally, the form he teaches in vol. 3 is my favorite exercise and I love doing it in the morning perferrably after a 45 minute walk (I like practicing his Eight Brocade form in the afternoon, perferrably an hour or so before sunset).  I suggest if you can, do qi gong outdoors in the fresh air...it is really invigorating.  Also, just as he suggests in his book and vol. 1, I suggest that you do the warm-up and stretching exercises he recommends before doing the set.  I have also added push-ups where he suggests them in vol. 1, ending the set with a few more push-ups and sit-ups.  Also, remember to always add the standing meditation exercise before and after the set...this cannot be over-emphasised to maximize the health benefits of qi gong.  I must add, I have been surprised in the change in my upper body physique...it does seem his method does add muscle and strength.

Shifu Lei does recommend that you add strength training, aerobics, or Kung Fu to your overally exercise program, so don't rely only on qi gong for your health maintenance.  Again, I cannot thank Shifu Lei enough for bringing authentic Shaolin qi gong to the general English speaking public.",1332720000,8,2757,4.59918200408998
7793626,5,0956310141,"After having first purchased his book, I found this treasure!  Shifu Lei is a wonderful instructor who clearly has a passion for what he practices.  Coupled with his book, ""Instant Health"", Shifu Lei guides you step-by-step in how to perform China's most valued qi gong form, the Eight Silken Brocade, or Eight Treasures as he refers to it.  I should point out, his accent is a bit heavy, but still you can follow along.  As he mentions in his book, you should not skip the warm-up or stretching which precludes the exercise itself.  The only draw back, you really need both the book and DVD to truly benefit.

I feel that I have benefitted so much from him (I also have Vol. 2, and Vol. 3; and personally, my favorite in the morning is vol. 3, another famous Shaolin classic, the Muscle Tendon Changing, Bone Marrow Clensing Classic).  I really hope to meet him some day to personally thank him for his DVDs and book.  But for now, thanks so much Shifu Lei, good health and prosperity to you.  May God guide you!",1332633600,13,1013,4.491803278688525
7793627,5,0956310141,I've had the opportunity to get to know Master Lei on Facebook and through his wonderful blog over the past year.  I have read and studied QiGong and internal martial arts for about 5 years and I can honestly say that Master Lei teaches the core principles of Shaolin QiGong in a profound and approachable way.  Namely the 8-treasures or brocade.  This is a great initial step into learning the mindful movements of QiGong.,1306800000,19,423,4.6891891891891895
