8527628,3,B008GIF9UE,"Dismissed by the people I saw it with in the theater, this is John Frankenheimer trying to channel Rene Clair in THE GHOST GOES WEST but the connection gets broken during the seance. Seeming overlong, inconclusive, and a bit too cute, it's not where Frankenheimer's talent lay. If you can unwind, however, you might just enjoy Alan Alda's perplexity with the always interesting and elegant David Niven in this mild fantasy which tries to form itself in the Pacific during the war.",1380326400,,480,4.865853658536586
8527629,5,B008GIF9UE,"I first saw this movie in 1969, and have seen it on cable recently. All I ever see are bad reviews on this movie. It is a great movie, with a great cast, David Niven, Faye Dunaway, Mickey Rooney, Alan Alda, Jack Carter. Now these are top notch actors. Do you think they needed money so badly, they would make a stinker? No. The movie is fun and enjoyable to watch. I hope it is released worldwide, like they seem to do with a lot of movies that are truly stinkers. Long live THE EXTRAORDINARY SEAMAN. J.R. Savannah, GA",1372291200,7,518,4.242424242424242
