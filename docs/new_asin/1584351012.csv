7799446,5,1584351012,"This film is truly wonderful in that it shows Gilles Deleuze without all of the fame, glory, and metaphorical ""red carpet"" that gets rolled out for him as a ""famous leftist thinker"" (whatever that means). He comes across as an eccentric, decrepit sage, that is to say, one who has been to many places, and affirmed most of them. The special thing about this video series is that he seems approachable, and perhaps even vulnerable throughout its duration.

Deleuze's academic writings are well-known for their impenetrability. Even some of the so-called ""brightest bulbs on the tree"" have been mystified and puzzled by his style and concepts. Reading his writings gives one the impression that one has landed somewhere one does not belong; everything seems foreign and out-of-place. It is not unusual for readers of Deleuze to give up their studies of his works out of feelings of inadequacy.

While this (giving up in the face of Deleuze's obscurity) is certainly an understandable response, it should always be remembered that Deleuze himself had a very complex and antagonistic relationship with academics. Although his writings are without a doubt ""academic"", the only things that make a professor more likely to read his work than a homeless man or a prostitute are:
1) likelihood of exposure (typically Deleuze is only discussed in academic contexts)
2) intellectual narcissism: the professor or graduate student is likely to have an insane amount of faith in their intellectual abilities, and is thus more than likely to have come under the impression that ""nothing is too complex"" to comprehend.

This video series, however, has something for everybody, and is not at all intimidating to watch, except perhaps in the case of viewers who are easily bored by low levels of visual stimulation. The title, which invokes the alphabet is expressive of this fact. This is a notoriously obscure and complex thinker who has chosen to make a video series based on the first thing we all learn in school: THE ALPHABET. Need I say more? ""From A to Z"" is splendidly, gloriously mundane, and perhaps, dare I say, a little bit heartwarming?",1415145600,2,2132,5.016949152542373
7799447,5,1584351012,"I was so happy to eventually get the whole Thing, after watching samples on Youtube, on and on.  You don't need to be in philosophy to enjoy Deleuze talking from A to Z about his practise.  What you need is to be alive, and to think about this simple ... concept.",1390348800,,263,4.137254901960785
7799448,5,1584351012,"I purchased this DVD in France, watched it in French, and was so pleased to be able to share an English sub-titled version with friends.  I am a real ""groupie"" of this unclassifiable French philosopher, and my husband and I made it a habit a couple of summers ago of watching one ""letter"" i.e. one theme every evening before dinner.  Food for thought but no particular prior knowledge required to enjoy it. One worries only about the state of the perpetually smoking interviewer's lungs!",1364688000,7,487,4.785714285714286
