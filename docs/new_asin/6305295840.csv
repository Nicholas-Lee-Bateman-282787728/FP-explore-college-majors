Begining with Midlife Crisis, and ending with a bonus live video of ""This Guy's In Love With You"", excitment flows  through the body.  I have to say that some of the behind the scenes video  is a little odd but... look what artists this video is for!  Jim Martain  bungee jumping is very funny.  ""I Started a Joke"" is extremly, I  mean extreamly impresive, considering that the bad never appears in it.  All FNM fans should have this video, casual or die-hard.  Faith No More in  the words of Brett ""Hitman"" Hart is the best there was, the best  there is, and the best there ever will be.",921024000,,683,4.234375
1005245,5,6305295840,"Cataloging a career that lasted 13 years of one of the most under appreciated bands in the universe, this video is a must have for any music lover. Most of these videos were rarely or never seen on American MTV.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",917913600,,232,4.523809523809524
7886900,5,6305295840,"Why the record company would put this out on VHS, and not DVD, is beyond me, especially considering its release date. The ultimate would be (and they have done it before, see both the Doors and Sepultura DVD releases) to take this, and add to it, Live at Brixton, and put it all on one DVD. Since this doesn't seem likely, I suggest, burn your own DVD, and include not only ""Ricochet"" and ""Another Bloody Murder"" (both left out), but also Mr. Bungle's one music video release. Happily, while ""Stripsearch"" is not listed on the back of the VHS box, it is included. FNM videos? GREAT, GREAT, GREAT...",1142899200,,598,4.546296296296297
7886901,5,6305295840,"Ever since the release of ""The Real Thing"" Faith No More has been one of my favourite bands. Recently I purchaced this Video Tape (Hopefully a release in DVD is forthcoming) It allowed me to listen to tracks that I have unfortunately overlooked such as ""Evidence"", ""Stripsearch"", ""Ashes To Ashes"", ""Easy"" and Many Others, as well as the beautiful renditions of "" I Started A Joke"" and ""This Guy's In Love With You"" . Listening to them now it is very apparent that the group missed their calling. Though International popularity was evident, mainstream in North America never quite caught on, except during the ""Epic"" period. Korn and Metallica has credited Faith No More as one of their influnces don't miss out kids!!!!",1097625600,,720,4.861788617886178
7886902,5,6305295840,"""Who Cares A Lot? The Greatest Videos"" was released in 1998 along with ""Who Cares A Lot? The Greatest Hits"", shortly before the band broke up. Since Faith No More were my favorite band, I was obviously upset about their brake-up, but this was a very nice 'going away present'. It contains almost every music video by Faith No More, along with some rare interviews and two live performances. Some videos, such as ""Ricochet"" and their collaboration with Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., ""Another Body Murdered"", aren't on the video, but this is the best you're gonna get.

Faith No More's videos were always very obscure, which could be the reason they aren't as famous as they should be. Nevertheless, each one held a distinct message to it, even if only a select few were able to understand it. For instance, the video for ""Last Cup of Sorrow"" would be infinitely confusing for some people, but it's really just a mini-version of the Alfred Hitchcock classic ""Vertigo"". Even if some videos may look ridiculous at first glance, it's fun to go back and see the small details that you might have missed. I'm sure most didn't notice that Patton is wearing a Mr. Bungle shirt in the video for ""Epic"". ""Everything's Ruined"" looks like it was shot on a cheap camcorder, but some scenes are hilarious (Like when Jim Martin is swimming while an image of the ocean is shown in the background, or when the band cowers in fear as a picture of a large turtle is shown). The video for ""Annie's Song"" isn't that great, but it's amazing compared to other videos from that same year.

It doesn't look like this thing will ever come out on DVD, so your best bet is to get it right away on VHS. A legendary band like Faith No More deserves to be remembered by all.",1094083200,4,1732,4.548076923076923
7886903,4,6305295840,"Who Cares A Lot?....well, I do for one!  I had lost track of Faith No More after Jim Martin left (got fired from?) the band but was still a little sad when I got word that they broke up in April of '98.  Suddenly, after the news, I went into a FNM revival, buying mostly everything they had put out since, cursing myself for letting them get away from me and never going to one of their infamous live shows.  Thankfully, we get a CD and video that attempts to wrap up their whole careers in a tight package, and does a pretty good job.  Most of the videos from their inspiring career are here, with little sections of interviews, home video footage, and miscellaneous junk interjected in between.  Since most of these videos were never seen in America, they are a must for the FNM fan.  Never dull, these videos will not be watched once, only to scrap the cassette aside with all your other junk.  Great stuff, from Introduce Yourself all the way up to and through Album of the Year, plus a few live performances which are great to watch.  The only problem I have with this video is the presentation, which is truly awful.  The video order is different on the cassette cover than it is on the tape, with some videos starting with titles while others don't, and the videos beginning with the Angel Dust era, only to go back to Introduce Yourself, and then back to Angel Dust!!??  Why not just go in order?  There are at least two videos on the tape that aren't even listed on the cover, but I guess its better than vice versa.  Faith No More deserved a bit more effort with the production of this package, but the stuff inside speaks for itself.  A truly great band.",997747200,3,1665,4.349514563106796
7886904,5,6305295840,"i have this in my collection and its the most watched out of all my vids.  the only thing that disapoints me is that they left out the video of ""ricochet"" from the king for a day album... its one of my favourite songs and has an unreal film clip  too... other than that, this is absolutely the best buy for any music fan.  its worth having in your collection.  wen are they going to release a ""Mr bungle"" video or dvd?? i'll keep my fingers crossed.",971654400,,449,4.126436781609195
7886905,4,6305295840,"Fantastic videos from fantastic band! The thing that makes these vids so unforgettable is Faith No More's unique sense of humour. This compilation  offers also the great opportunity to see some of FNM's live performances.  There's also some extra-stuff, and FNM at their spare time. Of course this  is must-have or least must-seen for every FNM-fan.",966988800,,349,5.196428571428571
