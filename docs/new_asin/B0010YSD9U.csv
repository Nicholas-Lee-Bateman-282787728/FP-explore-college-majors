3055610,5,B0010YSD9U,"Yes, you can definitely make a list of the four top Billy Wilder movies and it would not match what is in this set.  But that list would include the two Wilder masterpieces (""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Apartment"") and ""The Fortune Cookie"" is very very underrated.  So to have those three in one set is nothing to quibble over.  And the fourth film, ""Kiss Me Stupid"", is still both entertaining and an interesting step on Wilder's progression towards ""Avanti!"".  So if you own no Wilder you should start with this boxed set.

My only issue with this set is that the version of ""Some Like It Hot"" is not subtitled.  But given the excellence of the movies themselves this did not detract from my rating or my enjoyment.",1255910400,8,716,4.469230769230769
3055611,4,B0010YSD9U,"I picked up the BILLY WILDER FILM COLLECTION DVD SET because it was on sale here at Amazon. I basically wanted the DVD of ""Some Like It Hot"" and noticed that it was part of this collection, and with the sale price, this set was only a few dollars more than buying just the one DVD.

And I was curious about the picture ""The Fortune Cookie"" which Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon first team up, but I like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Odd-Couple-The-Centennial-Collection-2pc/dp/B001PKHS5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Odd Couple - The Centennial Collection (2pc)</a>&nbsp;better.

Anyway, this set collects the four Wilder movies ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""Kiss Me, Stupid,"" and ""The Fortune Cookie"" and offers them on four DVDs housed in slim plastic cases. The films are in black and white and range in date from 1959-1966

Even though I enjoyed watching the other films, ""Some Like It Hot"" was the stand out in this collection. And unless it goes on sale again, I would wait on buying this set unless you are a huge fan of director Billy Wilder or Jack Lemmon.
