1888406,4,B00009QGCE,MO'Nique is One of the coolest folks on the Planet&Funny as well. She pulls no punches&just comes at you no matter what the topic. She is very upfront&direct with her material. I've been a fan of Her work for quite some time. One thing about Her she doesn't  hold back&I dig Her Honesty.,1090022400,2,287,4.415094339622642
1888407,4,B00009QGCE,"i think bruce bruce is funny i have even stolen a couple of his jokes to use on my friends like my name isn't big swole. i thought it was funny alot of weight jokes, but atleast they're funny. i rented it and now im buying it so i would recommend it.",1077926400,,250,3.826923076923077
1888408,2,B00009QGCE,"OF COURSE, BRUCE BRUCE WAS FUNNY WHEN HE WAS ON COMIC VIEW, BUT THIS DVD IS VERY MEDIOCRE. JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE FUNNY MOMENTS ARE SHOWN EARLY ON IN THIS DVD. AFTER ABOUT MAYBE THE FIRST 20 MINUTES, IT JUST GOES WAY DOWNHILL. I THINK BRUCE BRUCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A FAMOUS COMEDIAN, BUT I KNOW HE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS! EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A FEW LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENTS, THIS SHOW DEFINITELY NEEDS SOME WORK. MAYBE NEXT TIME, BRUCE'LL COME OUT WITH A DVD THAT'S MUCH FUNNIER THAN THIS.",1077840000,,498,4.252631578947368
1888409,1,B00009QGCE,I rented this DVD thinking it was going to be as funny as the others in the comedy series but I didn't laugh at all.  In fact I didn't even finish watching it.  It was not funny at all.  Get Bruce Bruce's dvd instead.  That was funny!,1073260800,,234,3.9148936170212765
1888410,5,B00009QGCE,"bruce bruce is pound for pound the funniest man alive today. his hilarious inuendos, and his sporadic noises make for a great night with a lady friend, or just someone special. he's got a nack for pulling his head in real close and making sort of a high pitched chirp, quite the funny man! if i had to bet on a horse race, with a big horse vs. bruce bruce, i would choose bruce bruce, simply for the fact that bruce bruce would kill the horse with laughter before the race got started! hes funny, he hilarious, and i wish he would come to my house! His self depricating fat jokes top it all off, who makes his suits anyways!? JK Bruce Bruce, don't even play like you don't know!",1071273600,3,678,4.223076923076923

1888642,5,B00009QGCE,You'll be quoting this stand performance for the rest of your life.  Mo-Nique does not disappoint as she gives dating and parenting tips.  I love her and her comedy style because though most of it does come from an urban/african american viewpoint. Everyone can relate to life's ups and downs.  If you liked her in the Queens of Comedy you'll LOVE THIS!  Send your kids to bed and apologize to your neighbors for all the noise.,1380758400,,427,4.578947368421052

1888666,5,B00009QGCE,"Sheryl Underwood is clearly an intelligent woman. That being said, she's got a mouth on her, with her usual brand of in your face realism about every topic imaginable. But even when the words or subject matter is making your cringe, it's still hilarious, because she dares to think and say outloud the things other people pretend either not to notice or don't have the courage to say it themselves. I didn't agree with everything she said, and I didn't need to. It was nonetheless, all of it, very funny. It was a far cry better, and longer, than her previous stand up endeavors, and she keeps the laughs coming for the entire show. Suffice to say I came straight back here and ordered her other appearances, and I look forward to seeing many more in the future. If you're easily offended, then this is definitely not for you. But if you can handle it, you'll laugh. I wasn't disappointed.

  Thanks so much for your time folks.
  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell",1313798400,,955,4.594117647058823
1888667,4,B00009QGCE,This is a great show. She is always funny. She is also always raunchy and swears like it's going out of style so be prepared for that. Certainly not family night material. But I love her comedies. I've watched it many times.,1309219200,,224,4.357142857142857
1888668,2,B00009QGCE,"I'm a big Sheryl Underwood fan. However, this DVD is not much to laugh at. Weak humor and more preaching than anything. Is it me or does she have her pocket book on her shoulder the whole time? LOL. Good thing the price was low, I don't feel so bad for my loss.",1296518400,,261,3.943396226415094
1888679,5,B00009QGCE,Pick up this stand up as it is an instant classic and definately worth watching over numerous times. This guys is truly a gifted comedian. Definately pick this one up cuz its well worth alot more than the price that its listed for on here.,1285027200,,239,4.333333333333333

1888681,5,B00009QGCE,"I have watched Ms. Underwood for a while from her cameo's in super ""B"" grade movies to interviews on national talk shows to her having hosted Comic View. Until this DVD I had perceived her as a fair filler as I waited for the really good comics. But I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the material and her delivery is much better than her earlier performances. Still as raw as ever, she has honed her craft from pure vulgarity to very entertaining material that happens to be clearly ""adults only"". I am waiting to see what she has in store for us next. I gave this rating 5 stars for an overall great performance.",1257465600,,624,4.387931034482759

1888684,5,B00009QGCE,"I have seen many of comedians throughout the years, but Monique has always taken the trophy and then some.  She delivers the punch lines in a manner that you follow and are bound to laugh.  The characters in her show that she protrays, she presents it where you can actually picture this person if you were blind.  The laughs never stopped when I watched this video.  I pulled it out a couple of times during card parties and needless to say the game totally was put on hold, that's how well she capativated the household of card players.  Everyone asked "" where can I get that""?  So I strongly recommend this.  You can either watch it with your companion or with a friend, regardless I guarentee she'll say something that you will relate to.",1225929600,,742,4.492537313432836

She covers such hilarious subjects as her divorces, thinking her youngest child has gone crazy, trying not to [...] her pants on a date, her coochie and many other things. I thoroughly recommend this and Queens of Comedy if you want a good laugh. I've watched both like 10 times and still havnt gotten sick of them. [...]",1150934400,2,567,4.2592592592592595

Bruce also speaks on some subjects dealing with his family and this is stuff that the old school can really relate to but the younger crowd can't do anything but crack up at it. The jokes he told I couldn't really tell on Amazon.com but trust me you haven't heard this before. If you want to see some original stand up comedy then get this. What he does on comic view doesn't even compare to what's on this DVD. Maybe this will help, Bruce's platinum series is almost as good as Chappelles platinum Killin Them Softly.",1137542400,11,689,4.3076923076923075

This DVD is a great holiday gift.",1133136000,11,289,4.480769230769231
1888721,3,B00009QGCE,"Mo'Nique is one of my favorite comedians but this ""Deluxe Edition"" of her platinum comedy series dvd is not worth buying if you already own the original. The second disc is just an audio cd version of the show. If you own the original, then these ""Deluxe Editions"" of the Platinum Comedy Series dvd are not worth re-buying.",1120348800,8,323,4.586206896551724
1888722,5,B00009QGCE,"Laugh out loud as you spend 60 hilarious minutes with DAVE CHAPPELLE as he sounds off on everyone within earshot. Originally aired on HBO in 2000, ""Killin' Them Softly"" is without a doubt one of the funniest stand-up specials available. You'll never laugh more than you will here. Dave spares no victim as he addresses issues about the Police, Racism, Sesame Street, Kids, and the Government. It's hilarious! Comedy doesn't get any better than this!",1119225600,,449,5.0

1888724,5,B00009QGCE,"this guy is FUNNY! okay lemme' write alittle about what i know about him. What i know so far is that he used to be a truck driver for the lays co. He is a VERY big man of his size. And he can crack the funniest jokes you've heard. Whats funny about this guy is that he agrees with everybody. ""Your funny man"" ""Wow that was original"" and his laugh is so mighty. He has a GREAT sense of style. always dressing in suits, dress shirts, and a pair of nice shoes. Heck it makes him look like hes worth a few million dollars. It makes him look like he has been working for ""Donald Trump"" and won the apprentice. lol anyways about the DVD. i highly recommend this DVD to the adults out there. but if your under 12 i highly don't recommend it. and if you have kids...kick them out the room lol. altough his jokes aren't that dirty (Maybe to some they are) but just kick em' out just incase. im only 16 and i think their kinda dirty. and please, please, and let me repeat, please don't get offended by the jokes he plays. because some people take life so serious lol. recommended",1105833600,,1069,4.144230769230769
1888725,3,B00009QGCE,"Hey, I love me some Mo'Nique but...this concert was

 not really that funny.  She spent too much time talking

 about her divorce.  I think she could have diversified

 her subject matter a little bit more.  She was much more

 funny in her segment for Queens Of Comedy. I really believe

 there's so much more to her we haven't discovered yet...so

 stay tuned.",1098144000,7,362,4.612903225806452
1888726,5,B00009QGCE,"I borrowed this movie from a friend and never gave it back!!! I watch it almost every single night...that's how great this movie is!!! He mixes in cultural quirks, politics, and personal experiences that can keep you laughing for hours. (How do you keep a kid from getting kidnapped? Teach him how to cuss in public!!!) In the world of comedy, this movie rates at the top.

(A word of caution, however; this movie is targeted at African-American audiences. Most of the humor is related to the Black culture and may be offensive to or misunderstood by various audiences).",1096675200,,570,4.757575757575758
1888727,4,B00009QGCE,"We had big expectations for Mo'Nique One Night Stand as we feel she is one of the best, if not the best woman comdedians of our time. Mo'Nigue did not dissappoint. You should definitely put the kids to sleep before popping in this dvd, as she is very obscene and curses alot, although its funny its NOT for kids. She is alot funnier on this special then she is on the ""The Parkers"". Thats because the doesn't have to watch her mouth, and she can say whatever she wants without having to worry about it being bleeped out and she takes full advantage of that privilege. While on stage she gives it her all as you can tell by the sweat pouring off of her face. Several times during the show she got help from audience members in wiping the sweat off. She loves to make fun of skinny girls and even big girls for that matter. She jokes about everything from her divorce and kids to skinny girls and the rugrats. This dvd would of gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that she stayed to long on talking about her ex husband and kids to long. That got a little tiring. The dvd also would been better if there where some extra features. It would of been funny to see her behind the scenes. In the end it is recommended that you rent this dvd as it is worth seeing at least once. Mo'Nigue is quickly becoming one of the funniest comedians around. If you want to get more laughs from her check her out in the movie Soul Plane.

1888728,1,B00009QGCE,"I had viewed a Bruce Bruce show on Comedy Central recently so I thought that this DVD would be even better. I was wrong. While there are a few funny moments, most of it is pretty lame. He spends a great deal of time picking on people in the audience. While this may work well for the live audience, it does not translate well to the TV viewer. Also, from a technical angle, the lighting of this concert is bad. It almost seems amateur.",1093651200,3,435,4.190476190476191
