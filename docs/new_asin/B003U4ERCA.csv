8405628,5,B003U4ERCA,"This documentary is profound and gives awareness for anyone who is around children.  The increase in violence and exploitation of children must stop, but the systems presently in place to deal with it is totally ineffective.  This is a global problem.  The exploitation of women taxes the economy and has destroyed families.  Our expectations of the perfect family is unreal as women look only for a meal ticket and exploit men as a result.  We must stop the denial.  We must train our children to discriminate good from bad.  Unfortunately, the models for our children are the exploits of the Kardasians and there are no contrasting models.  This DVD clearly portrays the problems and has suggestions for solutions.  If you love children, this is a must see.  Awareness is the first step toward saving our children.",1337558400,,816,4.9338235294117645
