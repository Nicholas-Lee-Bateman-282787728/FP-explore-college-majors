7915615,5,B00002AFWV,These ladies do make learning how to belly dance and fitness fun.  They talk a little bit too much in the beginning for me. However when they get started its a really good workout. You can see the results quickly.  Very well paced for beginners. I highly recommend it.,1300233600,,268,4.448979591836735
7915616,5,B00002AFWV,"The last section of this workout video has perhaps one of the most amazing BellyDance routines I?ve yet to see. It was simply inspirational. Just a pity the credits were already moving along the left side obscuring some of the dancing. The outfit Veena or Neena Didasha was wearing was incredible. I want one. ;( Pout.  It was like her entire body was under her control, very sexy.

This workout is based on the ancient form of artistic movement and is one of the most sensual dances you will ever see or experience. Veen and Neena look like twins to me and they are rather cute to watch. They have been practicing Bellydance since childhood and have traveled throughout the Middle East and India to perform and develop their techniques. They have also performed for film, television, theater, music videos and even during Academy Awards.

I've tried other Bellydance workouts and this was is definitely different. It is not all belly dancing. It is a Bellydance themed workout. Normally, the dancers show you routines to follow. They normally show you the basics first and then you put them into a routine.

With that said, I managed to make it through this entire workout. There are some pretty difficult moves while you are sitting on the floor. Can we say Cleopatra? Yeah, that one was difficult.

This really reminded me a lot of Pilates and some yoga more than dancing. Perhaps it is more the preparation before dancing. I guess this is the theme and you do get to shake your hips around a lot which is very freeing if you like to loosen up your lower body and back. It is always fun to do goddess-type workouts.

I'd not recommend this workout to anyone with a bad lower back, that is for sure. Your legs are also going to get a good workout and this is definitely a dancer-level workout. Your feet have to be in good condition to do some of the up-on-your-toes dancing. You don't have to be overly coordinated to follow this particular workout because each exercise is done over and over and you can eventually catch up before the next exercise starts.

It is unique, that I?ll say. You won't really be doing any dance routines, just some moves and some isolated lower body moves.

Some of the things you do: circling hips, standing still and moving your hips in various directions, beautiful and traditional hand movements, stretching, cat stretch, Pilates moves, some yoga poses. It seems that half of the workout is on the floor and the other half is standing.

Loved the music and this workout will help you develop your sexy side.

Also look for ""Discover Bellydance"" - This is the series that includes Basic Dance, Beyond Basic Dance and Mystic Dance. That is what you need to learn the actual dancing, veil movements, figure eights, shimmies, rib circles and wrist circles.

Once you order the video you will also have a chance to look through the mini pamphlet and order a hip scarf, brass/silver chain belts, silver bell anklets, bellydance zills and brass hand bracelets.

7915617,5,B00002AFWV,"This is a great little tape. A 'typical' aerobics tape targeting specific areas would bore me, but months later I still enjoy this tape and the others in the bellytwins' series. The tape isn't too intense, but incorporates some fun moves (hip circles, hip lifts and so on) into a 30-minute routine laced with dance moves. If you want to spend half an hour getting revitalized, stretched and toned lower-body wise, you can't beat this investment.",1024790400,,445,4.868421052631579
7915618,4,B00002AFWV,"It is fun,exciting,intoxicating,different,and i love it. I needed to try something different that targets specific body parts and after  a few times i realised time flies by,those 30 minutes fly by like nothing. So try it.",973209600,,222,5.166666666666667
7915619,4,B00002AFWV,"These two sisters are adorable.  Although not necessarily physically taxing, this tape is fun!  Anyone interested in bellydancing, this video helps with discipline of the hips and makes exercising fun.  I've been  bellydancing for over two years and enjoy this video because I'm able to  exercise and use the artform I so love at the same time.  This specific  video does not teach technique though.  This video is geared towards just  getting a fun workout that focuses on the bottom half of the body. The  workout itself is about 25 minutes long with a performance clip of one the  sisters at the end.  The workout isn't terribly difficult or strenuous, but  it does get the heart pumping. Worth investing in the box set.",951609600,,723,4.780487804878049
