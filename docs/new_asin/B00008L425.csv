8305454,4,B00008L425,"Anything with the great John Savage catches my eye.  Here he plays an out of work film director who ends up desperately burning down his home to finance his next project.  Film has some very funny moments wrapped around the desperation of the characters.  Arye Gross is also particularly funny (and a cameo by Mick Fleetwood).  I would describe the film as a low budget version of ""The Player"".  Not perfect but worth a look.",1054252800,,425,4.613333333333333
