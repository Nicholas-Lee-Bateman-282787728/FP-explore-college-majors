6347186,5,B00J9IP888,"When my friend first talked about Aku no Hana with me, I wasn't sure how a story about three high schoolers could be at all interesting. She showed me the first episode and at once I saw what she meant. The atmosphere is incredible. The characters speak realistically. The events unfold organically, though you know something bad is coming.

Aku no Hana is a controversial anime due to its unconventional rotoscoping style, which at times paints the characters in strange ways. I found however that it made the story much more vivid. I wasn't distracted by its roughness at all and appreciated the human depth it granted to the characters. Granted, I'm not a huge anime fan, though, and have only viewed a few here and there.

In regards to the DVD set, I'm not thrilled, but I'm satisfied. The audio has the one original Japanese track, and there is one English subtitle track. It even subtitles the theme songs, which is cool. The exterior of the set is neat, and I like the disc art. There is nothing inside the case like a slip or pamphlet or anything; it's rather plain. The menu is very plain too; all discs play the same excerpt of Kasuga's version of the theme song, and there is a simple episode selection--that's all.

Overall though, I'm happy with my purchase and ecstatic this anime got an English release. If you like wacky animes with a lot of action or comedy, this won't be for you. But if you're looking for a story that takes its events and characters seriously, try out Flowers of Evil. It's a trip.",1406160000,,1519,4.556776556776557
6347187,5,B00J9IP888,"Aku no Hana is a masterpiece in a medium that has difficulty recognizing artistic perfection unless that greatness exists along pre-established lines. You may have already heard of the show as the one with rotoscoped animation  the show that anime fans by and large decried for being ugly, boring, and too different  too unlike anime. After all, anime have always existed as escapist tales of either over-the-top or nearly meaningless consequence, populated by purposely designed caricatures; Aku no Hana is not that. There seems to be little room in public perception for the medium to evolve out from under the prejudices of the average anime viewer. It is a shame, then, that we must discuss Aku no Hana as a work all but completely ignored when it is easily the most important anime of the decade so far and one of the most important of all time  let alone one of the best.

The story of Aku no Hana concerns a teenage love triangle where no one is in love. Our protagonist, Kasuga, is just another average student with nothing that sets him apart from his peers, though he fancies himself an intellectual due to his love of French poetry and philosophy. He is neither like Saeki, the popular star student whom he secretly loves and deifies, nor like Nakamura, the foul-mouthed and emotionally unstable girl whom the class collectively hates. His life is average.

One day, he realizes he left behind one of his prized books at school and returns in the late afternoon to retrieve it. The book is a translated version of Baudelaires Les Fleurs du mal, an anthology of poems dealing with moral decadence and perversion as a grotesque yet exciting response to ennui and normalcy. In the moment Kasuga finds his book, a bag containing Saekis gym uniform falls off of the classroom shelves and onto the floor. Kasuga gives in to sexual curiosity and removes the uniform from the bag, panics at a noise, and stuffs the clothes under his own, running home in shame. The next day, everyone knows that the uniform has been stolen and Saeki is mortified, but none suspect Kasuga. With her clothes back in his bedroom, Kasuga feels like he has gone past a point of no return, but when Nakamura confronts hims with her knowledge of his secret, Kasugas daily life becomes something else entirely.

The plot is an an unassuming one, but it is riveting to watch it play out. Nakamura is unwavering in blackmailing Kasuga, forcing upon him all manner of sadistic demands that result in physical, emotional, and psychological pain. She sees in him a fellow deviant who must be awakened. Saeki, on the other hand, ends up dating Kasuga, with her naivet about relationships pulling him ever closer while he wrestles with the stabbing guilt he feels over his secret trespass. Whats more, Kasugas constant trauma and stress have actually made the choice between Saeki and Nakamura a real one. He desires certain parts of each while they try to redefine the different halves they have seen of him as his whole. It is a love triangle without love, but rather of dependence, desire, selfishness, unfair expectations, and pain.

The subject matter is twisted and the events melodramatic, but possibly the most important reason why the production works lies in how the characters are still undeniably relatable, believable, and human under these extreme circumstances. Nakamura has no easy psychological answer to why she acts the way she does. She is damaged and emotionally hard, but she is also lonely. She is ecstatic about her connection with Kasuga and when not forcing demands upon him, she requests after-school meetings with him, only to talk. Saeki is not simply desperate for a relationship. She is happy that Kasuga likes her, but her confusion about his erratic behavior and his visibly close relationship to Nakamura translates into insecurity and self-blame. Her attempts to guide her first ever relationship back to normal take their toll.

Kasugas role in the story is paramount and he is neither a pure innocent being tortured nor a closet deviant realizing his true nature. He is but a teenage boy who made an impulsive mistake: the consequences of which led to two intense emotional relationships of a sort he has never experienced, and he loses himself in both. His genuine desire to understand the greatness of Baudelaire is matched with a Holden Caulfield-esque pretension that he is already there, too smart and too ambitious for the town in which he lives. But even as events spiral out of control, his analysis of them along the thematic lines of the art he so admires is piecemeal and naive. He is a confused teenager; they are all confused teenagers and that you can see that, believe that, and relate to that so strongly makes Aku no Hana a tragic drama as good as the best of them.

Its a powerful story and the aesthetics used to communicate it are just as impressive. Anime should not have to be confined to one style of animation and the rotoscoping of Aku no Hana proves that (though it will be some time before that proof is accepted). Director Hiroshi Nagahamas choice to make the show in this way places the visuals in a space between live-action and animation that is more effective than either medium on its own. Pure live-action would have necessitated a separation between the real world of the characters and the imagined representations of their fantasies and insecurities. Here, those visions belong to the same reality. After all, such things felt so vividly real to us when we were teenagers. Pure animation would have necessitated a streamlining of character design and movement. Here, the characters are captured with a fidelity that a caricature could not match. The way their faces change and their bodies move are captured with lossless, human transitions. It is surprising every time in a way that a character design could not allow.

Of course, the animation is only one aspect of the shows aesthetic perfection. Nagahamas direction is indispensable, faithfully adapting Shuzo Oshimis manga while liberally adding his own striking compositions. The series is littered with close-ups as character portraits and lingering shots of emotional turmoil and aftermath defined by suspenseful, nervous movement. It all works to bring the brisk pacing of the manga back down to the slow and purposeful build that the story deserves. The voice actors deliver amazingly naturalistic performances filled with raw emotion, with the post-production leaving intact all sorts of genuine cracks, hesitance, and frustration. This is to say nothing of the filmed actors whose studied physicalities were exactly what they needed to be. Further analysis could go into depth about the gorgeous backgrounds, the subtle ambient drone score, the pitch perfect dialogue, or even the shows ending theme: a haunting and disjointed piece of experimental electronic music that encroaches into the final moments of every episode, oozing dread. Everything works.

Anime is a medium still defined by safety and clich. I would argue that it has yet to hit its golden age  a period that other popular media have already had  when actual innovations and risks are celebrated instead of snubbed. Without spoiling anything, one of the defining scenes of Aku no Hana is an act of vandalism that comes at a crucial junction between two characters. A choice is made and it is expressed in violent destruction. It is an act so far removed from physical sex, but for these two characters it might as well be that, and everything of that scene is a conscious choice to communicate that complicated idea. I look forward to the day when the medium will allow another such masterpiece to exist and when scenes such as that one come around more often than nearly never. Until that time comes, may we never forget Aku no Hana.",1405382400,13,7808,4.910538286580743
6347188,5,B00J9IP888,"Flowers of Evil may just be the best anime ever made. In an ocean of boring, trite cliche, Flowers of Evil actually manages to achieve something that no anime even bothers with, anymore: pacing. The timing, pacing, and editing are more like a film than an anime (due to the fact that it *is* actually filmed), and the director takes his time with the shots in ways that typical anime fans are sure to hate.

There are no robots, there are no heroes, and there are no anime falls. There are no whatever-dere classmates, no rocket nosebleeds, and no battle anime fight scenes. There are long stretches where no one talks. There is confusion. There are mental breakdowns. There is desperation.

6347189,5,B00J9IP888,"Among anime fans, Flowers of Evil is one of the more divisive anime in recent memory.  One camp views it as a masterpiece, the other, a mess.

Flowers of Evil tells the story of a boy named Kasuga.  He leads a pretty ordinary life, going to school and goofing around with a small circle of friends.  His only real quirk is his love of books, and in particular he holds the 19th century poet Baudelaire in high esteem, along with his famous work Fleurs de Mal (""Flowers of Evil"").  Kasuga has a little bit of a thing for his classmate Saeki, who seemingly is the model student, but he is too shy to approach her.  And then, there is his classmate Nakamura.  She is a sullen girl who is known to curse out her homeroom teacher to his face and because of her demeanor she is avoided by most everyone in the class.

One day after school, Kasuga returns to his classroom to retrieve a book, and he sees that Saeki has left a bag behind which contains her gym clothes.  Ultimately Kasuga ends up taking her clothes home with him, which leaves him with feelings of loathing and guilt, wondering if this is the first step on a path of evil.  However, Kasuga's life changes drastically when Nakamura informs him that she witnessed him taking Saeki's clothes, and she blackmails him into making a ""contract"" with her.  The contract requires Kasuga to spend time with Nakamura, and do her bidding.  First on the agenda: Nakamura demands that Kasuga ask Saeki on a date while secretly wearing her gym uniform under his clothes.

Now, Flowers of Evil caused quite a stir in the anime community when it was released, and there are many very negative reviews of the show out there on the internet.  So, I'd like to address some of the main criticisms of the show which I've read.

Criticism #1: The characters are unlikable.  This is true, at least at its face.  Kasuga is seemingly as milquetoast as the blandest harem-anime lead, Nakamura is a bully, and Saeki is the typical perfect girl.  All these things appear to be true, but there is much more to these characters.  Being a fan of Baudelaire, Kasuga is willing enough to acknowledge the boredom of his existence and go along with Nakamura's increasingly-destructive whims.  Nakamura is a sadist plain and simple, yet it's impossible not to acknowledge that without her meddling, the wishy-washy Kasuga never would have mustered the stones to ask Saeki on a date. And without getting into spoilers, Saeki is not quite the perfect girl that she appears to be.  The characters all have an ugly underbelly, and the viewer is invited to acknowledge the less-than-savory elements of their own personality.  Baudelaire would approve, I think.

Criticism #2: The animation is ugly.  One of the notable features of the anime is its use of rotoscoping, which involves tracing live footage to produce the animation.  A side effect of this technique is that it is common for human characters to have blank faces unless they are viewed up close.  However, still shots (particularly of the city landscape) are breathtaking, with every detail captured.  This reminds me almost of Makoto Shinkai, except where Shinkai finds beauty in the mundane, the world of Flowers of Evil looks very tired and run-down.  Every piece of metal you see is rusted, street signs are bent, walls are cracked, and so on.  In my opinion, it makes for a very distinctive visual aesthetic.  In fairness, the use of rotoscoping means that the characters do not look like their manga counterparts, and some of the characters are quite ugly (one female classmate of Kasuga comes to mind---she has a square jaw, and she looks like a 35 year-old man with pigtails!).

Criticism #3:  The pacing is slow.  Again, this is true, but the slow burn is essential to enjoying the show.  For example, there is a scene at the beginning of episode 8 where there is no dialogue for almost 6 minutes; we simply see Kasuga and Nakamura walking home.  Critics of the show had a field day, but without going into spoilers, I think the slow walk home was brilliant.  After the events of the previous episode, the viewer needs to be allowed some time to digest what has happened and contemplate the consequences that might follow, mirroring the characters on-screen.

Criticism #4:  The soundtrack is weird.  It is true that the show has a very minimalistic soundtrack.  Often, a scene is accompanied by just a few piano notes which I think is a very effective device in creating an ominous atmosphere.  Plus, the ending theme is very cacophonous.  However, the different opening themes are quite creative, particularly Nakamura's, and I appreciated the minimialistic soundtrack.  I don't need to be told when something is about to happen with dramatic music and in my estimation the minimal soundtrack shows respect for the viewer.

One of my favorite things about the show is that it does not spoon-feed answers to the viewer, and viewers must decide some things for themselves.  Is Nakumura a sociopath or is she the only truly realized character in the show?  Is she leading Kasuga towards self-destruction or enlightenment?  What does she want to run away from?  Further, I found it extremely interesting that there are brief clips of the upcoming episode shown during the openings;  it's just enough to whet the appetite without giving away the entire story which is to follow.  Quite an effective device in my opinion!

So, I would say that Flowers of Evil is one of the more interesting anime of the last decade or so.  It is not for everyone; if I didn't know better, I would almost think the staff went out of their way to infuriate the usual anime-watching audience.  It is not an easy show to watch, it is a little disturbing at times, and the characters are not all that likable, but all the same it is an engrossing experience.  The viewer may despise the characters, but they are compelled to find out what happens to them.

About the actual release, this is a pretty bare-bones release.  There is no English dub, and the extras consist solely of some trailers for other Sentai releases.  I would have really liked to see some technical information about how the rotoscoping process works or some interviews with the VA's, or maybe even an interview with manga author Shuzo Oshimi (who makes a cameo at the end of each episode!), but this is the reality of US anime physical media in the year 2014, I suppose.

So, I would recommend Flowers of Evil wholeheartedly if you are in the market for a thought-provoking and unconventional anime.  The manga is also well worth reading, but if you've never read the manga, I'd wait until after watching the anime.  I had read the manga, and knowing what was about to happen at times took a little bit off the shock value.",1404777600,5,6758,4.710997442455243
6347190,3,B00J9IP888,"I'm an avid fan of the manga, but I will not being buying the anime adaptation sadly. I simply don't like how the anime is drawn. There is something about Ozumi-sensei's style that is very endearing and simple yet conveys so much emotion. I simply enjoy the manga but the screencaps of the anime... no. I simply can't do. Saeki simply looks fat in the screencap image, she never looked fat in the manga. So, while I enjoy the manga I will not get the anime.",1404259200,,457,4.325581395348837
6347191,5,B00J9IP888,"There are plenty of experiences that could be called stressful, but watching something isn't usually one of them. Typically speaking, you watch something to relax, to engage your mind, to tickle some sort of fancy. But there are those rare experiences that make you cringe, make you ask more questions than receive answers, that truly unnerve and stick with you, and make you question why you're even watching the darn thing... yet you just can't get enough. And before you've realized it, your nerves are fried and you've finished whatever it is.

""Flowers of Evil"" is one of those things. Easily the best psychological thriller since ""Lain"" or ""Paranoia Agent,"" and on the very same level of quality of the former, this 2013 series is one of the most controversial anime in recent history, and for good reason. It's unconventional both its approach and its execution, and by no means is this something I'd recommend to the casual consumer. It's a show for those like to question everything they hold sacred, and for those who like their viewing experiences to be the intellectual equivalent of trying to drive through a wall of molasses or glue. This is a show that is unsatisfying and impenetrable in many regards, yet on the exact same token, one that is satisfying, cathartic, and engaging.

Without giving too much away, ""Flowers"" follows Kasuga, who is a painfully introverted book lover who gets a crush on the beautiful, seeming epitome of normality, Saeki. After class one, he notices she's left her gym clothes behind, and takes them home in order to keep them safe, but somebody sees him. This person is Nakamura, a young woman who can only be described an absolute, literal psychopath. She accosts Kasuga for taking the clothes, and swears that if he doesn't undergo a series of demented ""tests"" she has lined up, she'll tell the entire class that he took the clothes for some perverted purpose.

This begins what is one of the most nerve-wracking experiences ever put to animation. The tests, while generally non-violent, are positively deranged in their perversity, and difficult to watch Kasuga go through for 13 episodes. It would be a real shame to spoil any of them, but I will say that they usually involve the protagonist constantly on the verge of public humiliation, or engaging in some kind of defacement of property. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this show, there ends up not being anybody you can really cheer for. As things wear on, you'll realize that no one character is actually good person. Everybody is absolutely messed-up in their own unique way, and a little more than halfway through the series, the whole experience becomes watching bad people do bad things to each other in increasingly disparaging ways. If you couldn't take the hint, this show is a giant downer, and a mentally taxing one at that. Oh, yes, and it's positively horrifying.

One of the major contributing factors to this is Nakamura herself. She's a brilliant character. Everything about her oozes ill intent and sadism, yet the way she manipulates people into doing what she wants is masterful. You hate her, but you want to see how she's going to enlist Kasuga or any of the other characters to help get her way. I've been reading books, playing games, and watching things since I was essentially cognitive, and I can fairly assert that she is one of the greatest villains ever written. Every horrible thing that happens in the plot, every negative aspect of every character that gets brought to light can all be traced back to her and her actions. Nakamura is a cunning master of deceit, constantly on the verge of an angry and violent outburst if she doesn't get exactly what she wants, exactly how she wants it.

What also manages to contribute to the overall atmosphere of tension and unease is the combination of bizarre imagery and the masterful usage of silence. There is, indeed, a soundtrack, quite a good and chilling one, but there are numerous instances throughout the series in which the only audible sounds are voices, background noises, or neither, for extended periods of time. This very minimalist approach also applies to the divisive rotoscoped animation, which sometimes is packed with action and unsettling, otherworldly imagery, yet sometimes is spent depicting a 12 minute walk back from school. Sometimes, the horror comes from what's occurring on screen, and others, it's based in what's inferred out of what isn't visible. ""Flowers"" is not a show that gives you things, unlike most productions in today's instant-gratification anime marketplace. Instead, it demands you to work through it, and to come to your own conclusion. And much like the works of David Lynch, or his late anime equivalent, Satoshi Kon, that mind-bending approach helps elevate it above the majority of what's released today.

As mentioned above, the animation in this series is very controversial. You can find articles praising it for its artistry and ambition, but you can also find angry forums about how it's not ""real anime,"" accompanied by unfortunate screenshots that ""prove"" that the animation is ""terrible."" Note the usage of quotations. I will face rage from fellow anime viewers and say that anybody who claims that this isn't ""real animation"" is patently wrong. Yes, the characters are rotoscoped from real actors and actual locations, but so much effort went into coloring it, adding visual flourishes, and drawing the otherworldly, hallucinatory scenery that calling it anything but animation is positively foolish. Anime, by its very nature, is animation that is Japanese. It does not mean big eyes, unrealistic proportions, or ""moe"" character designs. Insisting that it should adhere to those principles limits artistic expression in a field that desperately needs it, and furthermore, is the kind of entitlement that is exactly what's wrong the anime industry.

""Flowers of Evil"" is not a good show. It's not a great show. It's a fantastic show. In my 10+ years of watching anime, I haven't seen anything like it, and the stuff that's comparable came out a long time ago. It's a masterpiece, simply put. It's something that should be loved and cherished, passed down from one generation to the next like a fine work of cinema by Lang or Kubrick. It's all the things that the anime industry needs more of (risky, bold, thought-provoking,) all rolled into one. Whether you care about anime as an art form, or are simply looking for something in a Lynchian vein, this is something you simply must watch.

6347192,5,B00J9IP888,"Though some may find the direction of the art style a turn off, Shz Oshimi proves that anime can be more than just about ""Big eyes, big boobs"".

As one of the first who watched the simulcast of the Flowers of Evil when it came out on Crunchyroll, I was a bit skeptic at first with the non-traditional art style and the strange sounding name of the show. But as soon as I clicked on the first episode, I couldn't stop watching. Though it may start slow (And this is the reason why most are turn off from it), the buildup to the plot, the introduction of the AMAZING cast of characters, and the mood it brings is unlike anything I've ever experienced in an anime.

Flowers of Evil explores the coming of age genre in a unique and dark way. Perversion gets a REAL definition in this coming of age story.
What happens when desire overcomes reason?
What happens when temptation takes hold of innocence?

Speaking for the art style; It's different. And that's NOT a BAD THING! The style used for animation is known as ""Rotoscope"". Non-Traditional, I know, but the way it's used ADDS to the tension. If you're looking for unrealistic characters with simple, bland personalities, this is NOT the show for you. You'd be better off watching Girls Bravo or some garbage like that. The art style adds depth, realism, and a sense of loneliness. This is INTENTIONAL for the story. As the main character goes through his problems with the other characters, you get the sense of helplessness, just as we all did when we were kids.

Also keep in mind, ROTOSCOPE REQUIRES PHYSICAL ACTORS TO WORK. This means, not only was the direction of art unique, THE PEOPLE WHO PLAYED THE CHARACTERS WERE PHYSICALLY ACTING AND VOICE ACTING AT THE SAME TIME. And that takes A LOT OF WORK AND DEDICATION. Traditional anime? draw them in and voice act. Flowers of Evil? ACTORS. And GOOD ONES at that!

As for the character development, there is no other anime series aside from Eureka 7, FLCL, Gurren Lagann, and Future Diary that I have ever seen such great portrayal and such investment in characters. Main characters have REAL problems. Situations affecting them feel REAL. And you feel a PURE, GENUINE commitment to these characters. You can feel their pain, and relate to them in a way that feels genuine. Nothing feels forced as it's gradually given to you in small increments. Nothing is forced on you, like in traditional ecchi or shoujo.

Flowers of Evil, unfortunately, is only 13 episodes long. The GOOD THING is that it follows the Manga almost perfectly. So if you want to find out what happens next (AND I KNOW YOU WILL), you can find out in the Manga, which is currently being published by Vertical and released monthly. And if you think the Anime was crazy enough, the Manga will BLOW YOUR MIND.

There's just so much to say about this show and I can't find all the words for it. Flowers of Evil is more than just an anime or a manga, it's an art form. It's pure genius bundled up in a sinister, dark, seductive Blu-Ray disc box. And it comes with BONUS FEATURESSSSSSS!!!

In conclusion, I just can't recommend it enough. If you're looking for something TRULY unique and PERVERSELY honest, you will find no better anime than Flowers of Evil.",1400112000,19,3224,4.5947826086956525

8649051,4,B00J9IP888,"Just a short review as I think this anime deserves mention.

This is not your stock standard anime, far from it. If you like anime with some thought and story this one may be for you. I spent a lot of the time watching this wondering exactly where this was going and that is not a bad thing, quite unusual and refreshing IMHO. It is dark, some may consider it overdone but I kept thinking there are charismatic people in real life that lead others in very surprising directions and that, I think is a key thing to have in the back of your head, while watching this

The character of Nakamura is one of the strongest and best of all, consistent, that I've seen in any anime and really elevates this series above many many others. It is really intriguing that there are hints of another side to her, extremely rare but they are there. Then she returns to type so to speak and you are convinced of a misread but an age away, again a hint by a look or a gesture, you just never quite know. To me that was superbly done, again very very uncommon in anime.

The male lead Kasuga on the other hand is the epitome of frustration, however he is the exact blank cypher that is needed for Nakamura to grafitti so bear with him. It is hard though.

Many have commented on the animation. It is different but you quickly get used to it. Huge amounts of detail goes to minimal, even sloppy visuals and back on a constant basis. Faces particularly are usually sparse and in distant shots left completely blank. However in closeups I was amazed sometimes by how such sparse detail could ""say"" so much. The animation is what it is, the story here is the ace in the hole.

There are flat spots and that's why I've said 4 stars but on the whole this series was damned intriguing.

I'd be remiss also to warn that unfortunately this ends with a ""to be continued"". That was a real shock. I so wish that therew will be a second season to wrap it up but is now 2 years on.

8649055,5,B00J9IP888,"A purely wonderful work, thoughtful in many ways. The main idea is to question who the flowers of evil are. At first glimpse, it would seem to be the young antihero and his red-haired tormentor, but is that so?

When he first wrote the novel that is this work's namesake, Charles Baudelaire was complaining about what his Paris had become. A listless bourgeois bland-scape populated by ""The Flowers of Evil"": People that were at once so jaded and so banal. This wonderful story revisits that emotion from the point of view of the unfortunates born into the already existing world of ennui and cliche.

The rotoscope animation and occasionally hyper-realistic backdrops help to convey the realism and underscore the angst of the characters. No other-worldly, super-natural, trans-substantial hype here. This is the real world. The one we impose on ourselves, and, more importantly, on our children.",1414022400,2,897,5.136986301369863

8649057,5,B00J9IP888,"Having grown tired of most shows that focus strongly on gimmicks, fanservice, and other eye-catching traits that distract you without actually respecting your intelligence, I found it incredibly refreshing to stumble upon this beautiful series. It stands in stark contrast to virtually every other work of animation Japan has produced on a number of levels including the plot structure, animation, and themes, but most importantly, its soul.

Based upon the poetry of Charles Baudelaire, Flowers of Evil is about a boy, Takao Kasuga, who views himself as so much more sophisticated than his peers based on his reading and thinking habits, seeing most other people as typical, pathetic wastes of time. That is, except for his idol, his ""Maria"", Nanako Saeki, a beautiful girl in his class. Spending his life meditating on the difficult, erotically-themed poetry present in the original ""Flowers of Evil"" book by Baudelaire, Kasuga finds Saeki's gym uniform at school, takes it home in a sudden showing of perversion, and discovers that he has been found out by a class bully, Sawa Nakamura. As she blackmails him and tries to get him to show his truly perverted side, Kasuga's experiences leave the viewer wondering about the nature of sexuality as well as how it relates us to others.

Enough comments have been made about the thought-provoking and emotionally-rendered backgrounds and character animation, but what stands out in this series to me is its sense of place. Throughout the very first episode, long, drawn-out sequences are paired perfectly with atmospheric music and Kasuga's thoughts about life to paint a picture of a standard, boring, same-y world filled with people who can barely think for themselves. All of this culminates perfectly into the show's turning point where he is forced to question his own identity through his sexually-motivated actions and coercions. It reminded me of my own awkward adolescence, and made me think about all of my own awkward experiences in retrospect compared to who I am today.

In stark contrast to most anime series about teenagers and sexuality, none of it is played for laughs. Almost every development in the series is stark, bleak, and downright unsettling to the point where you wonder if things will ever get better for the main characters. There lies the beauty of the series: it doesn't have to. All of the characters' thoughts, actions, and mannerisms collide together to create an artistically resonant look into the life of developing teenagers with their own immature views on life and relationships. You aren't supposed to ""root for"" anyone, but rather, watch the train wreck as it slowly gets worse until it finally collapses upon itself in a heap of sadness and reflection.

If there is one thing that I would have changed with the series, though, it's the final three episodes. The series ""concludes"" a few times, most notably around episodes 7 and 10, but the season isn't finished until episode 13. After episode 10, the events that happen function as an epilogue to prior events as they set up for a hypothetical Season 2, filled with quick glimpses at the future of the series, if it's allowed to continue. Without a second season to follow up on, though, these episodes serve only as a reminder of the relative unpopularity of the series, and that is why I bought my own copy after watching most of it online.

If you are interested even in the slightest in this series, give the first few episodes a watch on a website like Hulu, where it's streaming legally free with ads for the time being, and then buy the series if it intrigues you from there on out. This is most likely going to be one of the finest examples of anime I'll ever be able to share with my friends and I hope that it gets the attention it deserves. No matter how you feel about it, Flowers of Evil is one of the most uniquely designed anime shows in recent memory and as such, it deserves a small amount of your time at least even if you end up thinking it's downright terrible.",1409616000,4,4024,4.843023255813954
