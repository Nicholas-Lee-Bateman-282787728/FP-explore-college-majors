3028609,3,B000YFSZ1M,"This software is not actually for the beginner or the expert. Bill Myers talks too fast and assumes that the viewer already has a working knowledge of the software and the terminology. A beginner would get lost quickly. He does not explain all the functions of the Vegas Movie Studio, thus the non-beginner would not benefit too much.

This software is good for those who have worked with Vegas Movie Studio and now want to learn how to give their videos a little more polish.",1221004800,9,476,4.6

3028611,5,B000YFSZ1M,"I've picked up quite a few of Bill's DVD's over the past year or so and this is one of the most valuable products in the bunch because this DVD showed me everything I needed to know in order to create my own how-to DVDs using Sony Movie Studio.

Sony Movie Studio can be a pretty overwhelming program at first glance, with all the windows, sliders, buttons and so on.  But Bill clears through all the noise and shows you exactly what you need to know to create a simple how-to DVD for any topic you can think of.

Keep in mind that this isn't some generic ""how to use Sony Movie Studio"" tutorial and isn't intended to show you every bell and whistle that this powerful software tool has to offer.  Instead, it's focused primarily on those buyers that are interested in creating how-to and special interest DVDs.  So if you're a budding movie maker, this will get you the basics but might not cover some of the special features or techniques you might be looking for.

However, Bill's goal is to show customers how to use these types of software tools and a little creativity to create a ""lifestyle business"", not how to become a pro videographer.

If you've never taken advantage of any of Bill's products, you'll enjoy his down-to-earth, ""regular guy"" approach to business, video, and other technical matters...he has a knack for taking complex subjects and breaking them down into the ""here's what you need to know"" pieces in a practical and hype-free way.

Be sure to check out his Youtube videos to get a feel for what this DVD is like and stop by the companion website too...more great ways to expand on what you'll learn in this DVD.  Thanks Bill!",1214179200,3,1653,4.538720538720539

8232625,4,B000YFSZ1M,I got a couple of good ideas from this - worth the price.,1427241600,,57,3.4615384615384617
8232626,5,B000YFSZ1M,"I received the DVD and it has great detail and i am still chasing the power curve and I SEE how this WILL amke my learning a bunch better!!

I can't wait to sit down and absorb he dtail and the information to make my videos EVEN better!!
 Thank you",1362700800,2,248,3.94
8232627,5,B000YFSZ1M,"This is an excellent video to teach you how to make videos! Bill shows you so much information that is extremely useful for anybody who wants to learn the tricks and secrets of using the Vegas platform. Maybe he does go through the info a little fast sometimes,but you can always play it over. As much as you like! Its really hard to beat and before you know it,your videos are looking professional. Its really the way to go. A super deal for the price.",1319328000,2,453,4.341176470588235
8232628,5,B000YFSZ1M,"This video is like having a video guru sitting beside you and showing you what to do every step of the way. I would hate to try to learn how to edit videos without this DVD.

I highly recommend this video if you plan on editing any videos.

8232629,5,B000YFSZ1M,"As with all of Bill's How To DVDs, this gives clear and well thought out advice that will enable anyone to produce professional looking DVDs using Movie Studio.  In my experience, it is best to watch the DVD through once, then go through it again with Movie Studio running and try each step as you go along.  I have bought many of Bill's DVDs and found each of them to be excellent value for money.  This is no exception.",1290988800,2,421,4.30379746835443
8232630,5,B000YFSZ1M,Editing How-to Videos with Sony Vegas Movie Studio is a DVD that helped me a lot. I recommend.,1284681600,2,94,4.277777777777778
8232631,3,B000YFSZ1M,"This is a very basic tutorial on the software Sony Vegas Movie Studio 7. I had Vegas 7 and the stuff that was covered were the things that I knew. I was actually hoping to see an updated version of Vegas 9.
I wanted to see what are the new updates on Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9.
However, I didn't get that information. So, overall, I think the DVD is a nice DVD. Felt very home-made type of DVD. Anyway, I gave it a 3 stars due to it's instruction and the time put to create the DVD. Thank you.",1269561600,4,493,3.94
8232632,3,B000YFSZ1M,"This video was OK, and i did learn from it somewhat, but it is a little cheaply produced.  But wait,is that what we're all trying to do anyway?
I don't know, maybe I was expecting more upscale movie editing, but it is really just a made-at-home video program with examples from cheaply shot video. What I'm trying to say is that it IS helpful, but not a highly polished operation.",1262908800,,380,4.428571428571429
8232633,5,B000YFSZ1M,"I bought Pinnacle Studio 12 (trying to save money, didn't know better) and struggled with it.  It's ok for beginners but I needed to do more - work in HD, burn professional looking DVD's for sale, create a worthy tutorial.

I did a lot of online shopping around and found Bill's channel on YouTube and watched a few videos and joined 2 video editing groups on Yahoo-groups.  The consensus was Sony Vegas, Movie Studio or Pro, was best and after watch the vids on  YT, I ordered the software and this DVD, which I watched most of today.

I'd say it's worth as much or more than the software!!  Yes, you do need a basic understanding of the screen and a few terms, and yes he talks faster than I do, but it's a DVD!  You can watch it over and over!  I learned more in 2 hours than I have in 3 months with Pinnacle!

This DVD teaches *exactly* what it says it does - how to create your own ""how-to"" DVD with Sony Vegas Movie Studio.  It's going to save me hundreds of hours of struggling and hopefully help me make buckets of money with my own DVD's!!

Wonderfully put together, personable guy, easy to follow if you have used ANY video editing software at all.  And really, all you need to do is follow the tutorial that comes with the software to learn the basics, then watch the DVD for the powerhouse of fast-forward learning.  If I could, I would give this TEN stars.",1245283200,4,1369,4.280155642023346
8232634,4,B000YFSZ1M,"As expected from the innumerable examples of Bill Myers' YouTube Video Tips, DVD previews, etc, this is an excellent tutorial video for users of Sony Vegas MovieStudio. He explains everything in a clear, concise, and practical manner. It is not just a chapter by chapter replacement for a manual or textbook. Instead, it is a wide ranging ""how to"" video, showing how to do certain tasks or achieve specific aims. Much of its value is derived from the fact that Bill Myers is sharing his personal experience, giving hints and tips, and pointing out pitfalls.  It clearly requires watching repeatedly, but owning this dvd must inevitably result in better and more professionally looking videos.
However it is not available in the UK, and the UK buyer should think very carefully before purchase. By the time the UK Customs have added VAT to the purchase price, and also VAT to the postage, then Royal Mail has added their 8 handling fee, one has purchased a DVD costing over 41. Regardless of how good it may be, such a price can hardly be justified.",1224028800,8,1048,4.758241758241758
