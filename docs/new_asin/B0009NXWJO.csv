3714413,5,B0009NXWJO,"It was fascinating the way all of the stories unfolded so unpredictably. And it's brilliant the way the stories link together. Now I understand why that guy Joe crashes the coffee date, accusing Miyuki of being ""ChinaDoll.""

I especially loved the ""Miyuki"" vignette with that lovable, sweet and sexually naive Dana Shiraki and the adorably awkward Jonathan Fielding, playing the culturally naive Michael, grinning like a nervous Cheshire Cat.

The casting is spot on with each character. The whole cast deserves an ensemble acting award. I wish there would be a TV series one day with all of these actors in it!

Aaron Mathias is perfect as the overly eager, bad actor, taking his Method acting so seriously. And how brilliantly ironic that his performance in bed with the Latin couple is an A+, but the audition is a total failure. (Even the casting directors were so perfectly smug and fake.)

And my heart goes out to the poor, lonely, insecure Henry. I love all the different ways he tries to lead the conversation into clumsy seduction scenarios. That was such a brave performance by D.J. Paris. That first scene was just so real, it was almost unbearable to watch. I'm so glad you gave him a halfway happy ending with Eric the actor at the end.

But these stories ring so true, that they are an uncomfortable mirror of society. The acting is flawless in every single one. There's not a weak link in the entire film. And that is as close to perfection as it gets.

This film is so smart and observant and poignant and human.  And for those who love short films, like me, Casual Encounters is extremely satisfying. I am proclaiming this film to be an indie, micro-budget masterpiece!",1426723200,,1687,4.717687074829932
3714414,4,B0009NXWJO,"I thought it was good.  No nudity or explicit sex, but the film showed different people looking for online sex or relationships, and what they actually got.",1426723200,3,156,4.777777777777778
3714415,3,B0009NXWJO,"Was a nice documentary on escorts. However after viewing the DVD, it didn't seem to have the quality of a Michael Moore documentary or something you would see on HBO or A&E.

The ladies interviewed had very interesting personalities, and the material was intriguing, but the presentation was very amateurish. This movie, in my opinion, is probably not worth the $24.95 asking price. Belongs in the bargain bin.",1131580800,,410,5.029411764705882
