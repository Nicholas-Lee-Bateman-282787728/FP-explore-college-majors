7903062,4,B000003KA7,"Well, since the Kazon are perhaps ""the"" villans of Voyager Seasons 1 and 2, it's good that we discover the roots of their aggression.  In this episode, we explore the hostile and distrustful relationship between the Kazon and the Trabe, and the result is an excellent episode filled with good dialogue and action.
Unfortunately, the crew of Voyager is, by the end of the episode, left in a position of complete isolation from both the Kazon and the Trabe...but Janeway stands her moral ground with both, and that counts for something!
Also in this episode, Seska makes an appearance, giving us still more reasons to hate her (as if we didn't have loads by this time!)
Overall, and enjoyable episode and one worth viewing from season 2.",996019200,,735,4.78740157480315
