8043374,3,B0006U5V6C,This was an interesting film.  I had never viewed a movie from the Phillipines before; strange and unusual are words that come to mind.  Big cultural and value differences that were hard to overcome for me.,1421020800,,206,4.694444444444445

8043376,5,B0006U5V6C,"I heartily second the review posted by Gaspard.  I am new to Filipino cinema, but this movie has definitely got me curious for more.

As other reviewers note, this is an endearing, realistic movie.  The main characters are not glammed up.  In fact, the main character is a real screw-up who has lost custody of her son after making a few bad choices in life.  The crying ladies are imperfect but very human.  Please ignore the old 1-star rating here.  It is totally unfair and just ridiculous (you're going to criticize the movie because you think the actress is too fat?  Really?)

Anyway, just wanted to through another 5 star vote up for this one.  Give it a shot.",1412380800,,667,4.529411764705882
8043377,4,B0006U5V6C,"It's a good realistic story about how some single Filipinas live and the troubles they face:  making a living alone, having low self-esteem, and dealing with married men who cheat on their wives.  I liked Sharon's performance.  She seemed very real and her character was not very glamorous at all, which I thought was courageous -- especially for a popular celebrity.  Borrow it sometime, you might like it enough to own it.",1185580800,3,424,4.847222222222222
8043378,4,B0006U5V6C,"A simple poignant story on the different reasons why people mourn or cry. This is not the best filipino film I've seen but it is definitely endearing and funny. It tackles a lot of issues and insights on modern filipino culture- the crossover of chinese traditions,economic migration,etc.

Pastre's review is more of a personal attack on the actors (severely over-weight? Come on.) and the Filipino film industry  rather than a critique of the story. Obviously, he or she is clueless how big  A.O. Scott and Kevin Thomas are in the world of film reviews.

Definitely, this film is worth watching. Believe me",1136937600,12,607,4.921568627450981
8043379,1,B0006U5V6C,"This is one of those silly, stupid, filipino potboilers with a plot as dated as the Byzantine civilization (without the cultural heritage though) starring the severely and grossly over-weight and untalented, over-acting Sharon Cuneta who's got a penchant for crying on television even in mid-age. Hilda Coronel was once-upon-a-time an actress with promise, however the roles that mostly come from studios in this land are so so limited. But still, Coronel could dazzle. One of those rare actresses who can elevate a movie such as this to something that is not.

Philippine showbiz is still run by tyrants(producers) and they run these studios a-la Hollywood sixty years ago. But sadly, these wealthy men run showbusiness like they're running a convenience store. Everything is but for the sake of art. Shame...

Which is why films around the world, evern obscure places like Eastern Europe or Persia are gaining international recognition, but could someone explain to me why nothing is coming from Manila...except the documentary Imelda. But in this case, the subject is the main focal point of interest, not the whole film per se or its execution...

And, who do they think could they fool, with an assembly of unknown so-called ""critics"" praising it to the heavens!!!Ha! Avoid this turkey!!!",1131062400,3,1293,5.177033492822966
8043380,5,B0006U5V6C,"This is my first film and I want to invite everyone to see this highly succesful movie. It has won several local and international awards and has received good reviews from the Village Voice, The L.A. Times , The N.Y.Times as well as several other major newspapers and magazines. If  you have never seen a filipino film, I suggest you start with this one.",1122681600,9,355,4.546875
