8267524,4,B0017VG64A,"The plot (if plot matters with a movie like this) is a teenage girl likes to romance an assortment of older men which get complicated. She ends up in England at an all girls school where she works to help her classmates gain a bit of experience. The ""games girls play"" is seduction. Those looking for full frontal nudity will not be disappointed. The photo quality of the film is not up to HD standards, of course, but it isn't awful.",1463702400,3,434,4.37037037037037
8267525,5,B0017VG64A,"If you like sexploitation films you should love this film.  A bit of a plot, a good amount of humor and a good number of nude cuties makes for a good show.  The picture quality is good with a bonus interview with the star and some trailers.",1431129600,2,240,4.085106382978723

8267527,5,B0017VG64A,"Coming on the heels of the sexual revolution, this early 1970s farce is a B-movie classic!  It is unapologetic about having naked girls cavorting about, all of them having the time of their life!  Christina Hart is beautiful and she's very comfortable prancing around in the buff.

Not much of a plotline here, but in this sort of film that doesn't really matter.  What plot there is goes something like this:  3 college aged British girls are led by the daughter of the American ambassador (Hart) to seek out important men to have a roll in the hay.  In fact, they have a contest to see which one can bed a guy 1st.  Obviously, this is a role-reversal of what you normally have as typically it's teenage boys who want to place a wager such as this.

All of the women in the film are lovely and 1 of the British girls goes well beyond lovely.  And, of course, all of them strip down.  This is in no way a ""teaser"" flick, so if that's what you're looking for, this movie is not for you.  On the other hand, if you want to see 4 rebellious babes escape from an uber strict girl's school and have an unforgettable night on the town, then this movie is EXACTLY what you're looking for!!",1396915200,11,1182,4.3031674208144794
8267528,4,B0017VG64A,"This is a fun film from the seventies that delivers for collectors of sex comedies. It pioneers the way for future entries in the genre with a 'game' devised by four friends to see who will get lucky first. The antics of the film are quite entertaining, bringing the attention of the audience to the film to garner appreciation for its cinematic aim. There is copious nudity but also the menial effort by the filmmaker to explore how young people come to terms with sexuality - in the case of this film there is a lack of moral platitude and instead each girl embraces a promiscuous demeanor that only brings each one of them temporary fulfillment. This is a standout movie for commentary on cultural behavior and how people come to terms with their personal identity. Christina Hart leads the adventure in this film with notable b-movie siren Jane Anthony. Their acting ability is good but not great. However the film succeeds in drawing and keeping the attention of the audience with a plot that is simplistic but engaging for this film and its genre. I recommend Games Girls Play also known as The Bunny Caper for b-movie connoisseurs.",1370995200,3,1138,4.723618090452261
8267529,5,B0017VG64A,"This 1974 movie has Very sexy and Pretty brunettes and blondes! There are several scenes of Full frontal and back nudity, with an underwater nude scene. Plenty of funny and silly dialog lines, and a very Good soundtrack music score! This movie was shown on the early cinamax cable channel, during the early 1980's. Miss Hart was also in a few other movies and on a few guest appearance TV programs. The video is a must see classic!.",1369526400,9,432,4.551282051282051

8267532,3,B0017VG64A,"If the above quotation from Christina Hart's character in GAMES GIRLS PLAY intrigues you, congratulations.  You're just the kind of person for this movie.

Scoring higher on the Cheesy Meter than a Swiss Colony catalog--and setting back the women's movement by at least a hundred years--there's little point in defending this seminal work of softcore yucks from the mid-70's.  And that's the point, I suppose.  It's so bad, it's good.

Plot?  Uh, o.k., sure.  Man-crazy Bunny (Hart) is shipped off to an girls' school in England, where she proceeds to engage her roomies in a game of Bed The Politician.  The bet is on and the clothes are off.

Really.  That's pretty much it.

Directed by once-respectable veteran Jack Arnold (Creature from the Black Lagoon, It Came From Outer Space, etc.), GAMES GIRLS PLAY is best viewed as a product of its time.  Personally, I first caught the film as a teenager on Cinemax's notorious ""Friday After Dark"" in the early 80's.  If you came of age during that era, Bunny's exploits may hold a certain naughty nostalgic charm.  And compared to today's smarter but far more cynical ""adult"" comedies, there's a goofy innocence about the film that might still win you over.

The extras include the R-rated trailer as well as t.v. spots, and a painful modern interview with Christina Hart.  Painful?  Well, her memories of the film aren't all that fond, and (with apologies to Ms. Hart) she looks very different these days.

The bottom line is simple enough: Either you're into this sort of thing or not.  If, like myself, you have actually have fond memories of the film, you'll find it's really not that bad.  As 70's teen sex comedies go, you could certainly do worse.",1228867200,29,1702,4.803448275862069
