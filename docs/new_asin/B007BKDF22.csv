8513858,4,B007BKDF22,"This is a mid-1990's portrait of artist David Hockney, done by German journalist Gero von Boehm in connection with a 1995 London retrospective of Hockney's drawings.  Hockney discusses several of his paintings and their creation in detail, and his experiments with photography including ink jet printing of his art. For photographers in particular, his discsussion of his Polaroid ""joiner"" art is especially of interest, although Polaroids have fallen by the wayside as digital capabilities progress. To get a timely continuum of Hockney and his art, I suggest also buying the DVD ""A Bigger Picture"" which updates Hockney's efforts through  2009, after he returns to his Yorkshire home from California to paint the countryside through the seasons in all weather. The two DVD's together provide a complete portrait of the progress and personality of Hockney, who has been called ""...today's greatest living British-born artist.""",1426464000,3,927,5.475524475524476
