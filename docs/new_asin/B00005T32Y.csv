1658919,3,B00005T32Y,"I have been a Firm believer since the beginning.  This tape has the same elegant set as previous Firms, but the sound and picture quality is not as good.  The workout and instructors are marvelous.  If you can get past the poor sound and picture, this is the tape for you.  (By the way, I have a new VCR and surround sound stereo and this tape still does not sound as good as the prior Firms.)",1019001600,5,393,4.131578947368421
1658920,5,B00005T32Y,"This is my first firm video and I love it!  It's a long, tough cardio workout(with some toning)which is exactly what I was looking for.  This instructors are knowledgable, and have the perfect amount of enthusiasm to get me through it.  At first I thought the backround was a little weird(with the artwork by Botticelli and Michelangelo and the oriental rugs)but I got over the scenery quickly.  I was sweating a ton by the end but suprisingly I was loaded with energy the rest of the day.  I hope that all firm videos will be this great!",1018483200,6,538,4.505154639175258
1658921,4,B00005T32Y,"One of my favorites.  This tape is challenging, varied, and fun.  From beginning to end, the moves are (in my opinion) higher impact, athletic stuff like squats, lunges, and plyo-jumps--with a few skips and grapevines thrown in.  But be warned, the pace is quick.  The first few times I did this tape, I thought I would collapse, I was working so hard!  But hang in there.  Just take your time and have plenty of water handy--you'll need it!",1016409600,6,441,4.589743589743589
1658932,5,B00005T32Y,"I have to agree with Dr. Beth's review on this workout video, but did give it a higher rating.  Why?  Because, while I do love The Firm workouts, all are a mixed bag of cardio and weight work.  While I understand the reasoning, it is nice to have one workout that is unabashedly all cardio.  Your heartrate will definitely get elevated (except, as Dr. Beth pointed out, during Dale's section), and there are times when it appeared that Jen did not know when to stop, but at the end of the 50 minutes, you feel that you have worked out.",1168732800,,535,4.32
1658933,3,B00005T32Y,"Firm Super Cardio features four Firm instructors--Allie Strickland (now DelRio), Carissa Foster, Dale Brabham, and Jen Carmen--leading various cardio segments in a wide range of aerobic styles, including floor aerobics (both low and high impact), 4-limb cardio, medicine ball cardio, short box cardio, and plyometric (jump) work.  Equipment needed for this workout includes a short step, light to medium dumbbells, and a medicine ball (dumbbell can be substituted).

Allie begins the workout with a short warm-up and stretch (4 minutes total).  Her first segment of short box aerobics using weights is simple and fun; it includes straddle steps, bicep curls, and overhead presses.  Unfortunately, her next segment, high impact aerobics using the medicine ball, seems to go on forever.  The ""power runs"" get extremely tiring by the end, and the entire segment is quite repetitive.  Allie's final segment is supposed to be low-impact, yet she does bunny hops and other plyo moves.  Her three cardio segments last for approximately 9 minutes.

Carissa comes next, and I enjoyed her segments the most, as they were the most fun while also keeping my heart rate raised.  She begins with low impact lunges, dips, and squats and then moves into some low impact step work with basic climbs and glute repeaters.  Her final segment involves some higher impact toe hops that are easily modified; there are also fun punches and other moves.  Unfortunately, Carissa's section is the shortest, coming in at about 7.5 minutes.

Dale's section starts off slow--so slow, in fact, that I had difficulties keeping my HR elevated.  She begins with 4-limb aerobics, moving with a side-back-side step and then eventually adding a side delt raise to this; a lunge/dip series begins moving things a bit more.  Her second segment of low-impact included sambas with pivots, kicks, and jacks--finally, my HR started to get back up.  She finishes with high impact moves of triple steps alternating with power jumps for a total of about 8 minutes.

Finally, Jen comes in for a long cardio stretch of 19 minutes, broken down into five segments.  The first was my least favorite, ball aerobics.  I usually enjoy working with the medicine ball, but just as Allie did earlier, Jen does high-impact jogs that seem endless.  This segment does include some low-impact work that's a bit more fun, with hamstring curls and v-steps, but there are just way too many plyo jumps in and out--my calves wore out long before my cardio endurance did.  Next Jen uses the low box for some shuffle steps and mambos, which was less fun than it sounds.  Her third segment of 4-limb aerobics was my favorite:  she alternates single/double bicep curls and heel lifts with single/double upright rows and hamstring curls.  I also enjoyed the knee/combo which follows, although as this was continuous high impact, I modified somewhat.  Jen's final cardio segment was again 4-limb aerobics, this time with sambas, triple steps, and squats.

At the end of Jen's cardio work, she leads a short stretch (2 minutes) using the short box, then moves down to the floor for abs work.  The abs work was so short (3 minutes) and basic (crunches and oblique twists) that it felt pretty unnecessary to me.  Similarly, Carissa's yoga-style final stretch (3 minutes) felt awkward; although I love yoga, I would have preferred a more traditional stretch segment here.  The entire workout comes in right around the 60 minute mark.

Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this workout:  it was more high impact than I had expected, with plyometric work that was grueling rather than fun; there was a lot of variability in the intensity of the segments, which meant that although the workout was definitely challenging, I had trouble keeping my HR elevated at times; some of the segments were too repetitive for my liking; and finally, I didn't like the overall feel, including the mansion set, the dated workout attire, and the dance club-style music.  However, despite these reservations, I plan to keep this workout, as I own few cardio videos of this length, and I think I can modify the sections I didn't like to better meet my needs.  I would recommend this to others who enjoy Firm cardio, don't mind  A LOT of high impact, and are looking for a challenging, varied aerobic workout.  Overall rating:  3 and a half stars.",1151280000,2,4350,4.9695712309820195

1658935,5,B00005T32Y,"I have quite a few fitness videos, and I think this one has become my new favorite. It is a mix of high-low aerobics sometimes using a weighted ball (I use a 4 pounder), a short step, and light hand weights. It's tough in some places (lots of plyometrics), but just when it would seem like I might need to slow down, they would mercifully move on to something else. If you don't like the current instructor, just wait a few minutes and a new one will lead, but I liked all of them, they were great. It's not too long, not too short, just right. I'm 45 years old and an intermediate exerciser. If I can do it, so can you!",1073865600,4,620,4.090163934426229
1658936,4,B00005T32Y,"When I previewed the tape, I found it so boring I couldn't watch the whole thing. I didn't find the music that appealing and the workout seemed endless. However, when I tried a couple of the routines  that are also in Total Body Shaping Mix, I decided to give it a try.
I have two left feet and even though there are a couple of complex choreography sequences, I still got a great workout the first time around. The second time around was more comfortable and by then I really began to enjoy the music and all the workout routines.
The ab section is too short and needs supplementing. That's why I gave it four stars instead of five. (I would have given this tape four and a half stars if it had been an option.)
This tape isn't consistently high impact like Tough Aerobic Mix. It alternates between a mix of high and low or lower impact sequences, so you're able to catch your breath before the next difficult sequence.
There are only a few step aerobic sections which is great if you need a tape that is not step intensive.
Dumbbells work the upper body, especially the shoulders.",1060473600,2,1082,4.41
1658937,5,B00005T32Y,"I agree with some of the other reviews. This is definitely one of the best Firm videos ever produced. The instructors are superb. The set is beautiful and the routines are very challenging. The instructors have an innovative technique of combining plyos, running and squats. You'll need two sets of weights, 3-5 lbs, a ball and a short step. I use a 9.25"" rubbermaid step stool. My favorite segments are the ones in which you use the weighted ball. This really gets the ole heart pumpin and they're so much fun. I also like the time length. It's an hour long so you'll get a great workout. The video ends with a challenging but short stability balance, bow pose and stretch. Although recommended for advanced exercisers, I would strongly encourage beginners to give it a chance. You'll be pleased with the results. Just stay focused and start off carefully and slowly.",1057795200,18,868,4.754966887417218
1658938,5,B00005T32Y,"It is sometimes difficult to find cardio workouts that are long enough and/or intense enough to get a good workout for advanced students.  This one does both.  Good variety of high impact, low impact (with and without weights), and step.  Good music, good cues.",1056153600,3,261,4.886363636363637
1658939,3,B00005T32Y,"I was very excited to order my first Firm video, but to my dismay, I found you needed not only dumbbells but a step and a weighted ball to use it.  I went back and checked your product details and nowhere does it say you need this equipment.  I tried to order the step, but amazon does not sell it.  It would be helpful if this was included in the product description since it is plainly visable on the back of the video cover.",1047945600,16,427,4.059523809523809
1658940,5,B00005T32Y,"I love this cardio workout from the Firm. Its great to use on cardio only days. Everytime I finish this workout I feel like I have really worked hard because its an hour of exciting and fast paced aerobic work. Its challenging and the steps are interesting but not too complicated to pick up and do it the first time through. It is challenging enough that you don't get bored with it.
This is great to rotate with any of the firm sculpting or sculpting with cardio videos, especially super sculpt, the cross training video made with super cardio.
Once you start working out with firm videos you'll want to collect them all.",1044316800,14,623,4.522123893805309
1658941,5,B00005T32Y,"This FIRM tape is a really great cardio workout!  This tape was exactly what I was looking for...a longer, fun but challenging, CARDIO workout.  The toning exercises are built right into the various movements...more bang for your buck.  Very small ab work on this tape so if you need mostly ab work, better find another tape, but for all other areas and especially fat burning cardio, this is the tape for you!!",1027382400,10,411,4.680555555555555

7953358,4,B00005T32Y,"I completely agree with Dr. Beth's review of this workout.  While Jen is a good instructor, her section seemed to go on forever, and the sections seemed uneven.  It feels as if the producers realized that they didn't have enough from Dale and Carissa, and had Jen do some ""filler"" work.  This is borne out by the pasted on section at the end on the step, where it is a completely different workout crew.  Further, Jen's sections do not seem to know when to stop. There is one section in which she does hamstring curls and v's that is just boring in its length.  Additionally, if you do not like plyometrics, this is not for you.

Why the higher rating than Dr. Beth?  This is the one Firm workout I have found that was truly devoted to straight ahead cardio work.  All of the other workouts are a combination of weight work and cardio work.  While I enjoy a compound movement as much as the next exerciser, it is nice to have a 60 minute workout in which 50 minutes is pushing you aerobically.

If you feel that you are not getting enough of a workout, I tried changing using the fanny lifter for the step portions to using the incline on the Transfirmer.  This gave a little more ""pump"" to the step portions. I do not recommend using it for the very first step segment with Allie.",1170201600,,1281,4.340336134453781

I am not a beginner; thus, this workout is very challenging. I do feel that I burned lots of calories. Yet, the impact was too much. I don't have shin or knee problems, but this video brought the problems out. My heart was pumping, but this was painful at times. There were too many segments - probably 20. Also, the instruction was not that great. I'm giving this 4 stars for the calorie burn, not 5 because of the length and instruction.",1169942400,,596,4.378378378378378
