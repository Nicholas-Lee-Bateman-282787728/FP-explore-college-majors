4505747,1,B004Z6NEZI,"Absolutely terrible workout video if you are in the market for something that will actually teach you the moves, keep you safe, and make you want to make it all the way through the workout.

I put in the ""Pilates-based Abs, Buns, and Thighs Workout"" and was greeted with menu options for Chia Ball Pilates and Dance Pilates Workout. Even though it had a different name from that on the box and the DVD itself, I decided to watch it to see what it was all about. It cuts to 3 women who are already exercising and holding small balls (even though there is no mention that you may need equipment to follow along with the DVD on the packaging) and not talking you through what you should be doing. I clumsily followed along, only to look up and catch a long shot of the ocean while the ""instructor"" was chatting about who she ripped this routine off of and where you can find it online. Needless to say, I stopped the tape after a few minutes, fast-forwarded it to see if the camera man ever kept a sustained shot of the women performing the moves (and he did not). I saw a lot of moving the ball here and there, taking a few steps, and changing the ball between hands. Not exactly anything that you would expect would work your abs, buns, or thighs.

I put in the basic pilates workout DVD instead. Again, the exercising is already taking place when the DVD first starts and this time there is a sustained shot of monkeys that appear to be on the side of a road somewhere and chatting. When you finally get a view of the workout, they are not discussing what they are doing or how many reps you should focus on. Instead, there's poorly planned shot after shot of portions of bodies completing one move after another with very little explanation of what is going on or how to complete moves carefully to avoid injury.

I cannot believe I wasted my money on this. I had just been at the store and saw it was the only Pilates DVD on the shelf, so I bought it thinking it can't be that bad. Well, it was. I had no reviews to go by in the store, but save yourself the trouble and keep looking for another DVD. This one is terrible. I am not even sure if the ""instructor"" even knows what pilates actually is.",1338854400,5,2199,4.2685851318944845
4505748,1,B004Z6NEZI,"I would not recommend this video its just not worth the money and I really wish I could get my money back.  I was really looking for a great Pilates workout and was totally disappointed.  Its mostly stretching.  The camera man is consistently zooming in which makes it very hard to follow the exercise. I actually had to stop moving because I could not see what they where doing.  The last workout stops right in the middle of the workout, I thought there was something wrong with the disc at first.  Save your money and time don't even bother with this.",1336089600,,554,4.445544554455446
4505749,1,B004Z6NEZI,So disappointed in this DVD set. This must have been from a TV show because of all the breaks. There is little instruction and it just doesn't flow.,1326153600,,148,4.321428571428571
4505750,2,B004Z6NEZI,"It seems to be a very low budget series, the host often loses focus, jumbles her words and acts awkward. The video isn't very effective, as the camera crew will be zoomed in on faces, as opposed to the moves being instructed. The only plus is that it offers four different types of workout disks, but I truly cannot not recommend it for any viewers due to the poor quality.",1322179200,3,373,4.3428571428571425
4505751,2,B004Z6NEZI,"This DVD is lacking many things. In most of the workouts, Shelly isn't the instructor, her partner is. The camera keeps panning in and out of the workout so you can't see everything they are doing. There is more stretching than an actual workout. Shelly seems confused on some of the workouts and she tends to digress in many of the scenes. I was not happy with this DVD at all. All of the pictures on the DVD for each CD don't even apply to the type of workout you are doing. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone. You are not getting what you see at all. If I could return this DVD from Target, I would, but unfortunately I don't think there are any stores that will take back a DVD if it's been open already. Do not by this DVD. I would even recommend a newbie to purchase this because you are not getting the workout you set out to get.",1319068800,,842,4.140243902439025
4505752,4,B004Z6NEZI,I have followed both Jenn and Shelly for years on FitTV and they are excellent hosts. Their workouts are challenging but not over the top. Perfect for me as a regular fitness participant. The Barbados locations are a beautiful escape and change to the normal studio setups and the production values far exceed most programs of this kind too. These videos are a most peaceful way to start my day but with the benefits of a good workout.  I recommend them to all but those wishing to jolt their body's to life with a high intensity workout.,1317686400,3,538,4.546391752577319
4505753,5,B004Z6NEZI,"I've done a lot of Pilates in the past;
recently I decided to take it up again,
and started with this set. The host is
amazing! She really know her stuff regarding
Pilates and the classic Pilates moves.
HIGHLY RECOMENDED OVER HER COMPETITION!",1317600000,,242,4.651162790697675
4505754,2,B004Z6NEZI,"As the other review stated, zooming in and out on the faces (or other scenes) instead of showing the full body so that we can see what we should be doing.  The entire collection is more stretching than anything and is so long (in length) that it gets frustrating.  Thus far, I wish the producers had been more focused because I do not see a common goal in each segment.

I like working out with the other lady in this DVD series rather than Shelly McDonald.

In two sections of the DVD set, you need a Chi Ball and a Big Abs ball, which is not listed as needed items on the product.",1311033600,8,582,4.123893805309734
4505755,2,B004Z6NEZI,"I needed a pilates dvd to change up my work out routine. Though this dvd has many different workouts and is helpful to beginners and intermmediate, it is lacking in some aspects.  The instructor (with Shelly) gets confused and forgets to mention important tips to keep from hurting yourself accidentally.  The dvd goes in and out of the work out, such as going blank or focusing on some boat or the house behind them, instead of focusing on the pilates move being shown.  There is also a lack of stretching before most of the workouts, which is terrible if you don't want to hurt yourself. When first showing the pilates move, the camera pans in to the work out instructors' faces instead of panning out to show the full move.",1305417600,18,726,4.569230769230769
4505785,1,B004Z6NEZI,"My mom and I purchased this pilates video set in the hopes of doing a few good pilates workouts. Instead, when we started with the DVD labeled as a ""Pilates- Based Abs, Buns, and Thighs Workout"" we were sorely disappointed. Unfortunately the cameraman seemed to be attempting some kind of poorly done artistic filming which results in close ups of the ""Chia ball"" in the instructors hands, the boats going by in the background, or just the instructors faces. This obviously makes the workouts very difficult to follow, as during transitions you are unable to see what is going on. At several points we were forced to guess at what we should be doing (often incorrectly), or basically just make up our own renditions of the move. After fumbling through this DVD with frustration, we decided to switch to the regular pilates video. And I most regrettably inform you that the poor editing may have gotten worse, beginning with the ever popular Barbados monkeys and giggling instructors. After minimal stretching, the video cuts away suddenly and without warning at several points to shots of palm trees, only to return to the instructors in a completely different position. This happened to us twice before we turned the whole thing off; once while we were on our hands and knees doing the ""cat stretch,"" and another time we were left hanging with no one to instruct us but the palm trees while we were in the ""plow position"" (on your back with your weight resting on your shoulders, and your arms supporting your hips with your legs in the air above you, or behind your head- both extremely attractive and dangerous when done incorrectly). On top of it all the instructors continually fumbled with their words, failed to give instruction overall, and as another reviewer stated, made distracted and random comments throughout. The instructors did seem friendly, but there was no focus to their instructions, which was made worse by the fact that the cameraman seemed to have no idea how the workout was supposed to go, nor did he/she seem to care. All in all, I would say this set is good for nothing more than a laugh.",1356739200,2,2117,4.771117166212534
4505786,2,B004Z6NEZI,"1) If you're psychic and can follow the absurd edits that jump from move to move with no warning.
2) If you can see through time and space to overcome the camera being cropped on the instructors faces when you really need to see what their legs are doing.
3) If you have $17 you desperately need to get rid of on something that you under no circumstances are allowed to enjoy.

In all fairness, I liked the instructors. Their voices were soothing and they had a good repartee. But the workouts were incomprehensible, and they often ran out of time. So in the end, this isn't one I'll keep coming back to. (Sorry, instructors.)",1354147200,5,626,4.443478260869565
4505787,1,B004Z6NEZI,"The best aspect of this poor excuse for a Pilates instructional DVD is the music on the menu page and the Barbadian monkeys at the beginning of the warm-up. Otherwise, there is no flow between segments, making it difficult to follow. Often, the segments begin with the camera focusing on the background and not the instructors, and when the camera finally pans in on the instructors, they are in the middle of the move and offer no guidance on how to achieve their form. The workouts are punctuated by distracted comments from the instructors (""is it raining?""). My advise: do not waste your money or your time. I have done my share of Pilates and this is a complete disappointment.",1347840000,2,682,4.691666666666666
4505788,2,B004Z6NEZI,"I wish I had seen the reviews of this product before I bought the 4-DVD set from Target (for $17 dollars).  I have not done Pilates before, but wanted to work on core strengthening and I've read that Pilates is great for that.  I regularly exercise and wanted Pilates to complement my triathlon training.

I started with the ""Pilates"" DVD, thinking that as a beginner, I should start with the basics.  Lo and behold, the instructors (who are obviously in shape and do not seem to take themselves too seriously, a plus for me) were already doing some warm-up moves, instead of telling you what to do first (most exercise videos I have seen usually have some form of intro where the instructor tells you what to do first).  The sequence is confusing (I chose ""play all"" instead of playing only segments).  The first exercise just ""faded"" away and the next thing you see the camera is focused either on the palm leaves or on the instructors' faces, instead of showing the entire exercise move when the instructors are starting a new pose.  It was very disappointing. (The Tai Chi and lying leg exercises, towards the end of the DVD, were better than the main Pilates portion, mainly because you get to see what the instructors are doing!  My legs were burning with this portion.)

I then decided to watch the ""Pilates Plus"" DVD for 15 minutes to see if it is as disorganized as the Pilates DVD.  The exercises seem tough and at least, for the first 15 minutes of the DVD, the whole bodies of the instructors can be seen so you have an idea what they are doing (instead of guessing how to do the move, like what happens when all you see are the palm trees or their faces!).

I will give the other DVDs in this set a shot and try the exercises, just to get my money's worth, but I think you are better off buying other Pilates DVDs.  As I have said, I wish I saw the other reviews first, before I spent money on this set.  Don't make the same mistake I did.",1345507200,,1952,4.373961218836565
4505789,1,B004Z6NEZI,"This video was the worst exercise video I have ever seen. They spent more time filming palm trees, monkeys, and their own lip-glossed faces then they did the the actual workout. This might have not been so bad if not for the fact that their directions were unclear and misleading. Furthermore, each segment of the workout only lasted about 2 minutes before they zoomed out for a long shot on the palm trees around them, leaving you wondering what the heck you were supposed to be doing. It also seemed as if they were sort of making up the routine as they went along, since the lead instructor kept on having to tell the backup instructor what they were about to do. The workout itself was not challenging or even focused- they spent the entire time stretching without ever getting to the point! The cover was misleading as it did not tell you that you needed equipment. All in all, the entire thing felt like a scheme, knowing that once you opened it, you couldn't get your money back.  If I could give negative stars, I would!",1344988800,,1028,4.497326203208556
4505790,1,B004Z6NEZI,"I wish I had done my homework.  This DVD is awful!!  I agree with the others.  The worst part is I couldn't get my money back because I had broke the seal!  In CA, we are not allowed to return DVDs that have a broken seal.  Maybe I can use it as a door stop.",1344902400,5,258,3.618181818181818
4505791,1,B004Z6NEZI,I bought this dvd from Target since it was the only Pilates dvd they had and I've wanted to try Pilates. I thought that if it was run like any other basic workout dvd then I could deal with it. First of all the dvd starts out showing monkeys because they are in Barbados so of course the viewer wants to see the monkeys. The cameraman showed the monkeys so long that the women started their workout already with no instruction so once he did switch the view to them you had to catch up. There were several awkward cuts where the viewer could not see the moves exactly and the instruction was pretty poor overall. (I'm used to the Jillian Michaels dvds where she is always on point and always helping as well as motivating her viewers.) This dvd fell completely short of what I expected.,1342656000,4,786,4.35374149659864
4505792,1,B004Z6NEZI,"I am a beginner to pilates and was looking for one more dvd that I might have to rotate with the one my friend gave me. I always watch the videos once through so I can follow them easier the first time I try them. The first tape really confused me. It seemed like they were rushing and talking a lot and there wasn't a whole lot of demonstrating. Secondly, the camera angles as others have pointed out didn't make sense or came midway into the pose they were trying to demonstrate. I picked this up on sale for less than 10 bucks and was happy that there were multiple routines, but even that seems like a waste. I'm hoping maybe I can salvage some of these workouts, but after reading these reviews I'm really not sure I will be able to. It certainly makes no mention of needing the ball or any equipment - imagine my surprise when I went on here to see if there were any reviews I saw complaints of needing equipment.  Aye, aye aye...I should have just got another Gaiam video like I was thinking about - one decent workout would have been better than 4 junky ones.

Update: no way to salvage, I just could not follow this, ended up going in the junk pile. Will not and cannot do pilates without adequate instruction.",1342137600,3,1219,4.2956521739130435
4505793,1,B004Z6NEZI,"I have used many work out tapes and was looking to try Pilates this is the worst, I mean worst work out tape I have ever bought. I tried to take it back to Target but they would not take it siting copyright infringement laws. Who in their right mind would want to copy this junk. My first clue of this crap was when the beginning warm up was looking at animals and not the person who was suppose to be showing me how to warm up. I thought I had missed something so I started it over again and no it was true, but then again, the animals had more engergy than the lead person.

The lead person (I don' even want to call her an instructor) kept looking at the second person and telling her what to do, if she didn't know before the workout began why was she there. Horrible I didn't even finish looking at it, this person must think that because she has watched some other videos she can now create one. Don't waste your money! I will not even give this away it will be shreaded. Horrible!!!!!!

Last, in my opinion those who are writing positive reviews, must be family members and are doing it to help sell this tape don't belive the hype.",1341705600,,1139,4.172727272727273
4505794,1,B004Z6NEZI,"So disappointed with these dvds. The camera work is very random, doesn't stay on the instructor.  The exercises aren't very challenging. There is no smooth flow from one exercise to the next.  Don't waste your money",1341446400,3,215,4.944444444444445

8449464,1,B004Z6NEZI,"Awful.  Ridiculously bad production.  The other reviewers have covered it all.  Bizarre editing (focusing in on palm tree fonds at odd moments), cutting away suddenly during an exercise and either returning to the instructors still doing  reps or returning to find them already starting in on a different move.  The camera often focused on their faces so you couldn't see what they were doing with the rest of their body, so you had to guess what your legs should be doing.  The camera would spastically switch between angles or zoom in or out for seemingly no reason at all. The instructors made a lot of mistakes laughed at themselves as they messed things up, jokingly complained about sun in their eyes, their mats being blown up by the wind, etc.  At one point they were in sneakers and noted oh, they shouldn't be wearing sneakers for this move.  It seemed completely unplanned and they apparently don't believe in retakes!  It felt like they were winging it and making up as they went along.  I watched two of the DVDs and then stopped.  They are so bad I am just going to throw the DVDs out.  By the way, I never saw a  beach.  All the work outs were by a pool.",1422576000,,1169,4.478672985781991
8449465,1,B004Z6NEZI,"Seriously. It's terrible. I feel your pain about no returns in CA. This is the last time I buy a DVD in a store without vetting the Amazon reviews first. Holy shnikes. There is so much downtime in these videos, beautiful vistas, but utterly lacking in workouts. The women seem to be loaded, too. Totally ineffectual.",1384819200,,316,4.660714285714286
8449466,1,B004Z6NEZI,"I'd give this dvd 0 stars if that was an option.  The thing that drove me crazy was the camera focusing on the instructors faces for such a long period of time--and close up too so you could not see the moves at all. I missed most of the transitions from one move to another.  I didn't think there were enough reps., and there was equipment that was used in the work outs that was not mentioned on the packaging.  Save your money, don't buy this DVD.",1376697600,,450,4.149425287356322
8449467,1,B004Z6NEZI,"Workouts are not correctly labeled on the actual DVD.  This video focuses more on the scenery than the workout.  Videography is terrible, directions unclear, and workouts choppy are incomplete.  You see more palm trees and monkeys than fitness instruction.  When you need to see the entire body of the instructor, you end up seeing only her face.",1374969600,,346,5.017543859649122
8449468,1,B004Z6NEZI,"I think the instructors must have had a few cocktails before doing this video. They were not focused, fell out of position many times, giggled, lost hold of the ball and complained about being tired SEVERAL times. Oh and the sun, the sun was in their eyes!! What the hell kind of amateur DVD is this? I understand the need for segments but none of them flowed smoothly together and there was no real transition. And each segment was SUPER short, I hardly broke a sweat the entire time. I can't picture splitting up this DVD b/c of that, although I guess if I am as tired as Shelly and Jennifer, it might be helpful to take short breaks between each. Each segment left with either no direction or just instruction to ""keep on."" Plenty of times the camera was so focused in on a shoe or something else, I had no idea what the hell the rest of their body parts were supposed to be doing. There were A LOT of shots of close up palm tree. Did anyone else notice the random people swimming in the pool in the background? Oh and the random janitor straightening out chair cushions by the pool. Totally cool and not at all distracting. The conversation between the two instructors seemed like something  you'd hear amongst friends, not in a class and certainly not while filming an instructional DVD. I was already frustrated about midway through, but when dumb dumb #2 dropped the yoga ball (how do you do that???), I lost it laughing. I bought this from Target and thank GOD I had a coupon although even $10 was too much to spend on this nonsense.",1363996800,10,1541,4.426056338028169
8449469,1,B004Z6NEZI,"WOW! I wish I had read all these reviews before I tried this Pilates workout.

I am a beginner to pilates, it seemed this DVD set would be perfect for me. So wrong. I only tried the 'Pilates' disc before I had to turn it off after 13 or so minutes, yelling at my TV the entire time.

As others stated, terrible film quality. If they can manage to get to a resort in Barbados, why not get a better quality camera?!

The work out was in front of a pool, not even on a beach (not a big deal but why market it that way when you're so close to the beach...)

The instructor and her friend who was along for the ride kept giggling at each other, obviously not taking it seriously. Could they have bothered trying another take without seeming like immature little girls?!

The camera had way too many close ups of the women. Terrible editing. Would jump from one exercise to a shot of a palm tree & then without any warning, cut to a closeup of the instructor again doing some new move, no explanation of what it is. Can't even see what they're doing until many reps in, catching up right when they switch to another move, and another face closeup. No idea what was happening. Then maybe on the last rep the instructor would say ""Oh you don't want your hips to move during this, that's the point of this exercise"".... which would have been great to know at the beginning of the movement.

OH MAN. this was just from the first few minutes. Absolute waste of money. So sad.",1361750400,,1464,4.248201438848921
8449470,1,B004Z6NEZI,"The lowest quality workout DVD I have ever seen.  Instructors get flustered, mix words, and occasionally will do a move on one side but forget to do the other.  While I'm sure all the women in these videos are very nice people, they do not provide a good workout.  In purchasing pilates dvd's, I wanted to work my core, specifically, my abs.  My legs would be kind of sore, but never my abs. Video quality is super low, and poor camera work.  Videos are edited to cut to close ups of instructors faces, abs, etc. when they should be focusing on how to do the moves. Videos will begin in the middle of the instructors doing moves; forget about getting yourself ready! Scenes will end, the camera will pan away to some ""beauty"" shot, and the instructors will be switching moves.  Absolutely horrible. Don't waste your money.",1360713600,2,822,4.557823129251701

I would most likely be repeating other reviews here, they are wonderfully written with great detail and thought. This is the worst work out dvd I've ever seen!!! Like others said here, the girls are ackward in many places which I can get past, however...what I can't get past is the poor instructions and the cutting in and out while a workout is already in progress and you have no idea what you're suppose to be doing or when to breathe, etc. There's one excercise that they do on the mat for the legs and they do not do all the moves for the second leg that they did for the first leg. At first I thought it was me, but I've done it several times now. Also, I am brand new to Pilates and have no idea where to start with these dvd's to build myself up without causing injury, and no where in this set are there any how to instructions.
I have used other excercise dvd's and had no problem following along a  great instructor.
