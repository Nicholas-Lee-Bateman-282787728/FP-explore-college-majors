So, if you're a fan of Betaville I'm sorry, but this is just stunning in it's awfulness. There are ""name"" actors who are career-endingly bad and young unknowns that are just bad-in-general. There's a screenplay chock full of loony ideas & music that's (w*t*f) inappropriate. There are kids in a cardboard tank that burn to death or blow up, I'm not sure which, and absolutely nobody notices or cares. Planet Z, Planet 38, floating fish, Tim Kurzurinsky as a giant talking head and all sorts of odd confusing stuff. The mute Lanny from Lizzie McGuire speaks at last which is kinda cool & I'm sure everyone who worked on this is plenty proud of their efforts & they all have mothers at home. But this thing just stumbles about on a whole different level. I'm a huge fan of cheesy cinema which is why I spent the time, but Betaville is seen at your own risk and I want my 5 Dollars back. NO seriously it's that bad.",1221868800,,1013,4.422459893048129

Imagine my surprise to see it appear on DVD now.  Was somebody clamouring to see a movie starring John Astin, Lou Rawls and Judge Reinhold?  I think not.  The story involves some nonsense about a camp called betaville where leaders of the world send their children to be safe and sound...until two warring planets decide to get Earth mixed up in their squabble.  An Emissary comes to Camp Betaville to warn the children and now President Sender (John Astin) and his scientists have to come up with a secret weapon to stop the alien invaders led by the ""charismatic"" Tim Kazurinsky.  This looked like it might be a decent family film but it's totally unfunny and leaves kids...and parents, totally bored.",1114473600,,834,4.601351351351352
