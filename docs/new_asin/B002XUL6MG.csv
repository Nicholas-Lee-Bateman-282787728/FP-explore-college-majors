4010947,5,B002XUL6MG,"'Revanche' is a film that ends strong but begins ugly and vulgar, although there's no question that the life director Gtz Spielmann portrays is exactly that.  Because of its candid approach, some viewers may find the frank portrayal of a brothel disturbing, and even perhaps unnecessary for a film that is ultimately concerned with redemption and forgiveness - but in this case I believe it's justified.  One of my usual complaints about film in general is the use of clichd shortcuts that hand the viewer stereotypes instead of characters, and even though Spielman doesn't escape it completely, this film's reflection of prostitution transforms the character of Tamara from cardboard into a real human being, and is what enables the build-up for film's quietly compelling finish.

Alex, an ex-convict, works as a gopher/driver for the owner of the brothel, and, in secret, carries on an affair with Tamara, a prostitute who needs 30,000 dollars to essentially buy her freedom.  He hatches a plan to rob a bank, thereby acquiring the money they'll need to escape their dead-end lives (I've yet to see this turn out to be a good idea).  Unsurprisingly, the bank robbery does not go off as planned, and Alex must confront the dark corners of his nature and decide what sort of revenge is justified when the world doesn't go along with your desires.

I've purposely left out a lot while summing up the film because, even though the information is easily accessible, it moves at different pace and with so few conventional clues that it achieves a heightened unpredictability that I wouldn't want to ruin.  Unpredictable may be too strong of a description, but the director does add a dose of uncertainty to a storyline that, in other hands, might have been numbingly safe and routine.  As I mentioned, pacing has a lot to do with it, and this may turn off some viewers.  There are stretches in the film where little happens - and even when the crucial moment arrives and Alex must decide what the rest of his life is going to look like, it comes with no warning and nearly off screen.  An inattentive viewer may miss it completely.

I enjoyed this film a great deal once Alex began to deal with the aftermath of the robbery - and the entire movie was intelligent and un-condescending.  Every time the director had an opportunity to do so, he treated the audience as if they were quite able to understand what was happening on screen, and didn't waste my time and patience by drumming every plot point into my head or spelling out every connection.  Still, it did have some faults.  Though random chance is definitely a factor in our lives, it's often difficult to accept on film, and this movie does indulge in it.  Aside from that though, there was little to criticize.  Cinematically crisp and striking, 'Revanche' delivers a resolution to impulse and fury that's told with both grace and dignity.

Although this film is not rated, it contains adult themes and situations, nudity, and frank sexual situations.",1266364800,23,3008,4.821011673151751
4010948,4,B002XUL6MG,"I saw this in the theater, but I'm excited to hear that it's going to be given the Criterion dvd treatment.  It certainly deserves it for the depth and intrigue and subtlety of the film, and for the power of the visuals.

Alex and Tamara are in love.  Unfortunately, there's little chance their love can work out.  He's an ex-con working as a bouncer at the brothel where she turns tricks for a cruel and jealous pimp, who's not about to let her go and who would kill Alex if he found out.  Hoping to make enough money to turn things around, Alex plots a fail-safe bank robbery, in which he thinks no one could possibly get hurt.  He doesn't even bring a loaded gun.  Things don't work out as he planned, however, and Alex has to take refuge at his grandfather's farm out in the country, where events take a truly unexpected turn.

The film opens with a powerful image that suggests the feel of the film that follows.  A beautiful rippling reflection of trees in a pond at dawn (dusk?) is given an ominous sense by the lightly disturbing tones that hum softly in the background.  Suddenly and loudly, the eerie calm is disrupted by a heavy object that is thrown into the water.  The images of a tranquil forest, reflected in the trees, are interrupted violently by the splash and subsequent waves, until they gradually return to a semblance of their former look.  Likewise, the uneasy peace of a small town is interrupted by the bank robbery, and the uneasy marriage of a childless young couple is further unsettled by the husband's tragic chance encounter with the criminals.  It's hard to know in advance whether the easygoing peace will return.

It's a story that could have been played for drama and action and rising intensity and pace, but is allowed here to be above all about character, with a tension that builds naturally and without the need for artificial plotting or manipulative music.  The acting throughout is strong, with special mention deserved by Johannes Fritsch, for what managed to be a both very physical and highly contemplative and reserved performance as Alex, but even the minor parts were perfectly casted and played extremely well. Gotz Spielmann brings a patient and masterful direction to this subtle and unique and mature film about love and longing and revenge and redemption.  Images are carefully composed and beautifully lensed, and the delicate pacing of the editing is matched by a subtle use of music and a darkly comic undercurrent to the tragedy.  Some viewers may want to know in advance that certain scenes in the film reflect a European sensibility about the body (i.e. there is abundant nudity and some sex).  Still, it's all tastefully done and in the service of the story and of a remarkable film that is well worth watching.

The Criterion release will include:

4010999,4,B002XUL6MG,"""Revanche"" (2008 release from Austria; 122 min.) brings a couple of parallel storylines which eventually intertwine. First there is Alex and Tamara, who are desparately seeking a way out of their miserable lives in Vienna. Upon visiting his grandfather out in the coutry side, Alex develops the idea that he could rob the local bank there. The second story line centers around Robert, a cop in the local police, and Susanne, who works (co-owns?) a local grocery store. As we get closer to the bank robbery, Tamara gets a bad feeling about it but Alex convinces her that everything will be ok. Tamara decides to go with him, and she will wait in the car while Alex commits the robbery. As she waits, a local cop (which turns out to be Robert) informs Tamara that the car is parked in a no-park zone, and to please move the car. It is then that Alex returns from the bank robbery. At that point we are only halfway into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: while the synopsis I described above may give you the impression that this is a crime drama, the movie, while certainly contining some elements of a crime drama, is in fact a masterful study of human behavior and the psychological consequences of acts, both intented and not intended. Kudos to writer-director Gotz Spielmann for bringing this to the screen in an understated way but delivering maximum emotional impact. Kudos also to Johannes Krisch as Alex, delivering a tour-de-force performance (and setting an unofficial world record for cutting firewood in a movie!). Beware that there is quite a bit of nudity in the movie.

""Revanche"" was up for the 2009 Oscar for the Best Foreign Movie but didn't win. Regardless, this is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare and if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, I would recommend ""Revanche"" in a heartbeat.",1359244800,3,1952,4.688046647230321

4011022,5,B002XUL6MG,"Alex (Krisch) works as a bouncer in Vienna and does odd jobs for the owner of a brothel. His Ukrainian girlfriend, Tamara (Potapenko), works there as a prostitute. She is 30,000 dollars in debt and he needs 50,000 euros to buy a share in a nightclub. Alex has a plan to solve their problems.

He decides to rob a local bank. It's in a quiet little town and he's figured out a good escape route. In his mind, nothing can go wrong. Tamara has a bad feeling about it and insists on coming along. Rather predictably, something does go wrong.

After a policeman, Robert (Lust), intervenes, Alex is forced to flee to the countryside and stay with his grandfather on a farm. He was wearing a mask during the robbery, so nobody knows that he was responsible. He hides out and works out his fear and anger by chopping wood for his grandfather's fire.

A neighbor, Susanne (Strauss), occasionally stops by to check on his grandfather. She's friendly, but Alex wants to avoid her as much as possible. We later discover that she's the wife of the police officer who tried to foil the robbery.

Alex, Robert and Susanne all have difficult problems to face. Alex wants to avoid being caught for his crime and faces another dilemma that I won't mention; Robert is struggling with the way he performed when he tried to stop the robbery, while Susanne's deepest wish can't be fulfilled by her husband.

It's a fascinating story, but I am reluctant to give away any more details. All I will say is that the climax offers a number of interesting solutions to each of the problems. The needs of the individuals are satisfied in unexpected ways that aren't always ethical or legal, but it's not hard to imagine acting in the same way if you were placed in any of their situations.

The film is set in Vienna and the language is predominantly German, although there is a little Russian in the first act.

Spielmann effectively creates tension and it slowly builds throughout the story. Dialogue is kept to a minimum and that decision feels right in this particular film. There's very little action, and it plays out like a tense drama. The film is beautifully shot and the scenes in the countryside look spectacular. The peaceful setting is in stark contrast to the emotional turmoil faced by the characters involved.

I like to be surprised and find it boring when I can predict the outcome early in a film. Revanche certainly isn't predictable and I think you'll find the conclusion rather elegant.

It's difficult to explain why Revanche is a great film without giving away key plot points. I hope that you will give it a try and trust that it's worth two hours of your time. It's even better on subsequent viewings when you have clearly fixed each character and their secrets in your mind.

The Criterion Blu-ray offers wonderful audio and visual quality and is the best way to see the film unless it's being shown at a local theater for some reason.",1331942400,4,2932,4.621153846153846

4011027,5,B002XUL6MG,"The title Revanche is the German word for `revenge' and the film has some well-known themes of revenge and grief, but it is the way writer/director Gtz Spielmann handles these familiar themes that makes Revanche the compelling, existential work it is.

Alex (Johannes Krisch) is a bouncer at a brothel in Vienna. His girlfriend Tamara (Irina Potapenko) is a Ukrainian prostitute who works at the brothel. The two are forced to keep their relationship a secret and they have no money to escape together. Alex decides that he'll rob a bank to acquire the money for him and Tamara to flee to Spain and the plan goes nearly perfectly, until a cop (Andreas Lust) shows up at just the wrong moment. The first half of Revanche takes place mostly in the seedy underworld of Vienna, while the latter half takes place almost exclusively at a small farm owned by Alex's grandfather. It's there that Alex discovers the cop lives nearby with his wife Susanne (Ursula Strauss).

It's hard to give an accurate description of what this film is about without mentioning the latter half of the film. With that said, it's hard to describe the latter half of the film without spoiling the first half but I've done my best above. To tread carefully again, Revanche is a ""crime-thriller"" with two characters experiencing different kinds of grief over the same death and one character methodically plotting his revenge. You can see how this formula could grow familiar, but Spielmann never allows it to seem clichd or anything but fresh and alive. While some have found the pacing slow for a crime-thriller, I found this film to be more entertaining and compelling than most action-packed American crime-thrillers.

Spielmann proves here that, when making a film, it's not about the story but the way you present it. He allows his characters and their dialogue to lead the plot instead of leaving the plot to lead the characters and the dialogue. Not only that, he's written some three-dimensional/believable characters that are perfectly embodied by the actors portraying them which allows Spielmann to create something more memorable than it has any right to be. The plot remains absolutely riveting throughout and unfolds brilliantly while avoiding anything gaudy, surprisingly powerful even as it unfolds at a simmer.

There's a lot of humanity in both the film and the performances, which are all great. Not being familiar with the actors in the film only lends to how easy it is to disassociate the actor in the role with the character they're playing. Krisch makes Alex an ultimately sympathetic character, while Strauss makes the role of Susanne something very special. The exchange between Krisch and Lust at the end is one of the film's more powerful scenes, which I attribute to how well the actor's interpreted the emotions of the script. It would be a crime to not mention Hannes Thanheiser as Alex's hardworking grandfather, as his performance too is quite wonderful.

Throughout the film, there is a distinct visual style maintained without ever being flashy or obvious. Cinematographer Martin Gschlacht has a perfectionist's grasp on the outdoor scenery and some of those shots are absolutely serene. The cinematography as a whole is very eloquent and endlessly fascinating. The lack of close-ups that seems to imply a disconnection to the characters and the camera watching them is brilliant and, once again, unique for a crime-thriller which tends to be more in-your-face.

Spielmann is a writer/director I'll be watching for as this film implies he's a director with a uniquely creative vision. Had another director handled his script, the finished product would be quite different. Even a sex scene late in the film was interesting in the way it appears graphic but drapes everything in shadow.

Revanche was quite the surprise. An overwhelmingly great film, that's both poetically hypnotic and quietly electrifying. There's not one defining characteristic that makes this film great, it's the work of a first-rate filmmaker that brought all the right elements together perfectly. It's one of the most accessible titles in the Criterion Collection that even the casual filmgoer will notice something special about. Everything here is great and while the script is solid, it's the direction that elevates the material to new heights. If there's a scene in this film that doesn't work, I can't think of it. It's an incredibly rare compliment, but I loved every shot of this film.

This is a carefully orchestrated film set in and around contemporary Vienna.  It is about how the desires and needs of men and women differ at the most fundamental level.  The action concerns what can go wrong when you try to rob a bank, even when you use an unloaded gun.

There is an old saying in the theater that if you show a gun in the first act, it had better go off in the third act.  Here director Gotz Spielmann plays a variant on that old stage business.  We see something splash into a pond as the opening credits roll.  It is not clear what it is.  The camera lingers as the concentric ripples spread out and then are done.  Later on in the film we see the same scene from the point of view of the person who threw the object into the water.  It is near the end of the film, in what in the theater would be the third act.

""Revanche"" in German means ""revenge.""  We all know how hard it is to forsake revenge when we have been hurt.  We want to strike out at some target.  But what do we do when we have no target or when the target is innocent?  And to what extent is the desire for revenge a way of absolving ourselves from what has happened?  Revenge is a standard, even hackneyed, movie theme.  Action movies and thrillers often employ the psychology of revenge as both theme and plot device, as a way of keeping the audience emotionally involved.  Here revenge is used in a different and ultimately redemptive way.

Early in the film the camera lingers on a street scene.  We see a narrow alleyway like an urban street tunnel.  The camera holds that shot so that we expect to see someone or something emerging from that alleyway.  But it is only later that the scene is revisited, and much like the pond scene mentioned above we see the scene from the opposite angle, and what transpires contains the central event of the movie.  This sense of seeing scenes from different angles--opposite angles actually--is echoed in the opposing perspectives of the two women and the two men.

There is, for example, the symmetry of how the two men work off the psychological tension that they feel.  Robert (Andreas Lust), who is a cop who has accidentally shot and killed a young woman involved in a robbery, jogs.  Alex (Johannes Krisch), who is the boyfriend of the dead woman, a woman he loves very much, puts his physical energy into chopping wood--viciously.  For one it is the cardio and the legs; for the other it is the upper body.

And then there are the two women: Tamara (Irina Potapenko) who is the young woman now dead, who was a prostitute, and Susanne (Ursula Strauss) who is the cop's wife.  Both are very physical as women, both aware of the power of their bodies, but more significantly both are aware of their primeval need to understand men, and their ability to do just that.

Susanne, who is thoroughly bourgeois, does something that is condemned by society in the same way that prostitution is condemned.  Yet she acts out of clear intent without a hint of shame or the sense that she is doing something essentially wrong.  The prostitute acts out her societal role with a shrug of her shoulders as to society's hypocritical morality.  Thus both women are morally and humanly the same.

This is Spielmann's point, not to make moral judgments about the worth of either man or either woman.  The prostitute is the moral equal of the cop's wife, and cop's wife is the equal of the prostitute who sells her body.  And the man who kills because his aim is bad is the same as the man who caused the death because of his criminal act and his carelessness.

And in a deeper, extended sense, the old man (Alex's grandfather) grows old and will die soon, but another life is stirring, and will be born to take its place in this world.  And so it goes.  It is not for us to pass judgment on the rightness or wrongness of any of this, except to say that revenge, as Susanne expresses it, is a ""sin"" whether you are a ""believer"" or not.

At any rate, this is a finely wrought and beautifully realized film by a gifted cinematic artist who explores the human condition with sensitivity and candor while eschewing clichs and easy answers.  I hope to see more of his work in the years to come.

4011030,3,B002XUL6MG,"First of all, this is the first time I've ever felt the urge to write any sort of review for anything, on Amazon or anywhere else.
Revanche is a great film. Masterful even. All of the positive, glowing comments about it are true. The jaw-dropping visual beauty of it alone makes this well worth checking out.

However, and this is a huge however given that this is a Criterion release, the subtitles are absolutely horrible. How horrible? in an early scene after hearing a knock at the door a character responds ""I coming"". That wasn't a typo on my part. The subtitle read ""I coming"".
This type of shoddy translation continues through the entire film. You learn to overlook it, and substitute better, or at least grammatically correct, translations in your head. But this wasn't released by some fly-by-night discount label. It was released be the venerable Criterion, and regardless of the company releasing it, translation of this level of incompetence shouldn't be released by anyone. It's an insult to both the intelligence and pocketbook of people who actually, you know, want to watch foreign films.

And it's hugely disappointing. There are very few films like this made, well... anywhere, these days, and it's almost completely ruined by subtitles that make an 8 year olds book report look like a masterwork of shakespearean proportions (by comparison).

the film - 4 stars. it's a slow burn, it's not to everyones taste, but it's an expertly crafted piece of cinema.
the cinematography - 5 stars. simply breathtaking
the subtitles - half a star. because, yes, there were english words on the screen, and at some point somebody sat down and attempted to translate it.",1273017600,2,1675,4.932624113475177

4011032,5,B002XUL6MG,"Being an avid and enthusiastic fan of the Criterion Collection I payed their website a visit and stumbled upon this little Austrian Gem. The Criterion Collection's poetically brief and yet informative summary enticed me to purchase this with little or no hesitation; and, I must say that this purchase was very wise indeed as it fulfilled and surpassed all of my expectations in terms of character development, plot and cinematography. After viewing this film, I am happy and confident to say that this will not be Gotz Spielmann's last collaboration with the Criterion Collection.

Gotz Spielmann's ""Revanche"", initially invites us to the beautiful city of Vienna and then spoils us by showing some of the gorgeous and serene Austrian landscapes.
In this breathtaking setting we are introduced with Alex, (Johannes Krisch) a man who works for a bar/brothel in the downtown area where he engages in a secret relationship with one of the Ukrainian prostitutes named Tamara (Irina Potapenko). Their strong feelings for each other provoke them to leave the brothel together in secret and start a new life. Despite their financially weak positions in order to embark on this new life, Alex devises a plan to rob the local bank in his grandfather's neighborhood. Moreover, the plan is quite simple and painless to Alex:

Approach the bank tellers wearing a ski mask while holding them at gunpoint and escape by driving away with Tamara. (Sounds pretty simple and painless)

Our next couple is that of Susanne (Ursula Strauss) and Robert (Andreas Lust) who live in the beautiful countryside outside of Vienna next to Alex's grandfather. On a surface level, Robert and Susanne seem happy; however, we soon discover that Robert's inability to impregnate Susanne puts quite a strain on their relationship. As a result, a conflict of interest surrounds the choice of adoption; Robert refuses to adopt someone else's child because he cannot be sure of it's inherent character as compared if it was his own.  Susanne, on the other hand, is tired and impatient of Robert's failed attempts and wants to raise a child sooner than he can provide.

Alex's grandfather (Johannes Thanheiser), a diligent and hard working man who owns a small farm, is suffering from some unknown medical condition, or possibly just old age.  His stubbornness disallows him to attend professional medical treatment because he simply does not want to leave the farm. Although the grandfather mourns the loss of his wife, the farms demanding maintenance keeps him busy and motivated, not too mention Susanne's frequent visits provides good company as well.

The interaction and relationships between these characters are very realistic and believable, and even more so in a very pleasant and mesmerizing setting no less. The carefully crafted and well thought out characters will easily immerse one into their personalities and actions. Personally, the opening scene of the film is one of my favorites which is a steady shot of a crystal lake and the reflection of it's surrounding trees; wild birds playfully and instinctively chirp, calm waters stand idle like a beautiful portrait and the subsequent soothing ripples that follow will definitely send a warm invitation to many. This opening shot is significant in the sense that it represents not just any ordinary reflection, but as a safe haven for two of the main characters to ""reflect"" on themselves and the choices that they have made.

Now, the closure of this review could not be justified without an extensive review of the picture and sound provided courtesy of the Criterion Collection. Let's just say that this film would be a nice piece of bait for a salesman trying to pitch a sale to a customer even remotely interested in buying a Blu Ray player. This Blu Ray disc does not disappoint in the least bit Quite frankly, I will go as far as to say that it is flawless. End of Story.

Fresh, lush vibrant Greens, different shades of sunlight, crisp skies, will literally come out of your screen like the most beautiful spring day you have ever witnessed. (I am not kidding either) You  will smile at just about every pixel and shade of color that it emits from it with utter appreciation. From the interior of Susanne and Robert's modern house, to the grandfather's dreary and antique looking farm, to the crystal clear forests and gorgeous lake shots, you will be impressed. The array of colors shown in this film are presented to perfection; moreover, they are incredibly consistent and  become more impressive within each passing frame. What's even more impressive is the depth of clarity during the exterior shots of the countryside, it is truly unbelievable. Whether it is the dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, bark or cobble stone the detail is so fine and sharp that it will leave you breathless. Flesh tones are rich and sharp as well; they shine and adapt well to the different variety of sunlight and weather patterns in the film. Overall, the picture is just purely consistent and flawless in every sense.

The sound which is presented in DTS HD MASTER Audio does not fall short in any regard either; however don't look for any rumbles or giant explosions raging through your speakers because that would be just frivolous, this is a drama centered on rich characters and their dialogue. For the most part, the sound will dominate through your center channel and front speakers quite nicely; the rear speakers will be given nice attention as well, particularly during the exterior scenes in the country side or during some of the downtown Vienna scenes. Small European cars will accelerate on the cobble stone with ease, light rain will padder and gently collect into puddles  with superiority, the birds and wind breezes will delightfully hypnotize you,  and the discharge of a Glock 17 Semi-Automatic pistol will break and startle your peace with pleasure.

I have to tip my hat off to the actors, the director and of course to the Criterion Collection for adopting this piece of artwork into it's collection. No other film distributor could of done it better. Amazing.",1269907200,2,6099,4.9891732283464565
4011033,4,B002XUL6MG,"****Warning: Spoilers ahead

This film's first fifteen to twenty minutes may give one the wrong impression of exactly what kind of movie this is going to be. The rawness may give credence to the description ""erotic thriller""; however, this description is erroneous and misleading. While there are some definite ""mature"" moments, Revanche is a character study in dealing with life's conflicts, and the themes of redemption and forgiveness are at the forefront. There is an artistic quality that the director, Gotz Spielman, brings to the film, with a heavy dose of moments relying on mood and pacing rather than action or dialogue. Yet, these scenes, such as the one where the main character Alex arrives to his grandfather's place after his tragedy, give power and meaning to the film. The film's second half--where two character's lives become intertwined away from the city--is sharply contrasted with the pacing of the first half.

Alex, who works as a bouncer in a brothel in Austria, has a secret affair with Ukrainian prostitute, Tamara. Alex hatches a plan to have them leave this sleazy place behind, but in order to do this Alex plans to rob a bank to make this hope a reality. However, when an off-duty police officer encounters Alex as he is making his getaway, things go terribly wrong that alter both Alex's and the officer's lives. The officer (Robert), in an attempt to shoot the tires of the car, mistakenly shoots and hits Tamara, who dies. Alex, shocked and upset, drives off but eventually stops the car in the woods and leaves Tamara's body and the car, fleeing to his grandfather's farm for refuge. Alex, trying to lay low, begins to work to busy himself and deal with the heavy loss. He finds solitude here, but cannot seemingly escape the feelings of pain. Robert, meanwhile, must answer questions from his superiors about what went wrong with the shots fired, and feels a heavy dose of guilt about the event. He even goes to the point of carrying around Tamara's picture to try to come to terms with the conflict.

Alex and Robert's world collide again as the film moves away from the city to the country. In an ironic twist of fate, we find out that a woman, Susanne, who comes to visit Alex's grandfather at the farm, in fact, Robert's wife. Susanne feels a pity for the old man, and wants to check on him regularly. The fact that Robert and Susanne have not been able to have kids has put a strain on their marriage, and now Robert's isolation and moods compound the problem. Eventually, Alex figures out who Susanne is married to and has motives for revenge, which he begins to plot. However, Alex's epiphany comes when he understands that individual pain is not an isolated event, that those directly affected are not the only ones suffering. The death of Tamara has deeply affected and pained both men, one having a feeling of loss, and the other a feeling of guilt and regret.

Coming to terms with pain is an issue explored in Revanche, and moving on to lead a healthy existence. Speilman does a superb job of helping you feel the character's emotions without making everything too obvious. There are times when he could have chosen the easy road, but he treats this story with an understated quality, and I find this refreshing. This is a film that demands reflection on the part of the viewer once the credits are rolled, which is an attribute of a film that has done its job.",1269820800,,3410,4.706867671691792
4011034,3,B002XUL6MG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  The most striking thing about 'Revanche' is that the first half is so completely different than the second half. The story is set in modern-day Austria where the protagonist, Alex, is working maintenance in a brothel and is in a relationship with Tamara, one of the prostitutes there who hails from Ukraine. The opening scene between the 'couple' features a somewhat explicit sexual encounter (there are other such steamy sexual encounters later on in the film). Be forewarned--there are no subtitles in the first two minutes of the film as Tamara is presumably speaking in her native Ukrainian and we're not supposed to understand what she's saying.

  Up to the midpoint of the film, we're treated to a gritty, behind-the-scenes look at the Austrian underworld. Tamara owes her boss, Konecny, $30,000 (presumably for arranging her passage to Austria). Tamara is Konecny's 'favorite' at the brothel and wants her to move into one of his own apartments where she can service more upper-class VIP customers. Meanwhile Alex dreams of buying into a pal's business but is significantly short of the $80,000 needed as a start-up cost. When one of the customers roughs up Tamara, Alex intercedes and beats the man up. Realizing his days are numbered at the brothel, he spirits Tamara out of he house of ill repute to a seedy hotel where he decides his only solution to the financial mess they're both in, is to rob a bank.

  The midpoint of the film is perhaps the strongest. Alex successfully sticks up the bank, but a police officer (Robert) just happens to come along and questions Tamara who's sitting in the getaway car. When Alex returns to the car and sees Robert, he pulls out his unloaded firearm and has the officer lie down on the ground. As Alex drives away with Tamara in the passenger seat, Robert violates police procedures and fires at the wheels of the car; unfortunately his aim isn't very good, and Tamara is hit by one of the bullets and is killed. Robert leaves Tamara's body inside the car and abandons it in a forest.

  The second half of the movie is much more slow-paced than the first. After Alex takes refuge at grandfather Hausner's farm, he settles in performing various chores for the sickly old codger. He steams inside over Tamara's death and blames it on Robert. There are way too many repetitious scenes of Alex chopping wood, symbolizing his pent-up rage. Coincidentally, Robert's wife, Susanne, a cashier at the local supermarket, has befriended Alex's grandfather and often comes over to keep him company. Alex is extremely cold to Susanne (since she happens to be married to the man who killed his girlfriend). Susanne has had a recent miscarriage and has been having trouble getting pregnant; perhaps, this is one factor why she decides to have an affair with Alex. Another may be that she is attracted to 'bad boys'.

  The climax of the film isn't very exciting but it's a relief. Alex learns that Robert takes a jog in the woods every morning and plans to shoot him. One day he aims his gun at Robert but presumably decides to talk to him first. When they do have their conversation, he realizes that Robert is extremely remorseful concerning what happened (it should be noted also that Robert was suspended by the police force as 'unfit for duty' and ordered to see a psychologist). Robert's parting words in which he asks why the bank robber decided to involve his girlfriend in the heist, makes Alex realize that it was he who really was responsible for his girlfriend's death. He redeems himself by throwing his gun into the lake and promises Susanne that he'll never tell anyone of their affair. In turn, he confesses to Susanne that he was the bank robber and presumably their secret is safe with him.

  While I was disappointed that Revanche did not have a slam-bang twist ending, I was relieved at the same time that Alex did not resort to the ugly act of killing Robert. Certainly a story about an immoral person taking responsibility for his actions and thus redeeming himself in the end is admirable. However, director/writer Gotz Spiellman engages in a strategy of moral relativism to tell his story. In effect, Spiellman is saying that 'we're all human and we all make mistakes'. In Spiellman's world, people make bad decisions: Alex concocts the robbery, Tamara goes along with it, Robert fires at a vehicle moving away from him, in violation of procedures and Susanne commits adultery by having an affair. But Alex's actions are placed on the same level as Susanne despite the fact that he's committed a crime. Even though he robbed the bank without his gun being loaded, he still terrorized the bank teller and the customers inside the bank. He should be held accountable but the mere act of showing remorse is enough for Spiellman to forgive him. I am, however, not as forgiving of the character as its creator. Spiellman 'forgives' Susanne too for her 'transgression' and rewards her by having her get pregnant. But again, Susanne's indiscretion is just that--an indiscretion! Alex's 'misstep' is a crime! A better ending would have been to have Alex turn himself in.

  There are some excellent performances here, particularly Ursula Strauss as Susanne, whose misguided attraction should be a cautionary tale to all those women attracted to 'bad boys'. If you're willing to put up with the slow-paced second half, Revanche is well worth watching. On the other hand, don't expect a masterpiece. Revanche gets a little too cozy with the idea that redemption is for just about everybody. Redemption is only acceptable when it's coupled with both remorse and accountability. By giving Alex a 'free pass' at the denouement, the film's scenarist misses an opportunity to make a true and impassioned moral stand.",1269648000,7,5807,4.86322188449848
4011035,4,B002XUL6MG,"A brief introduction to the film, which is a character study of four characters and how their unlikely paths will soon cross. The opening scene forecasts whats to come in the movie when a placid lake is disturbed by a heavy object thrown in it.

4011036,4,B002XUL6MG,"The tagline on the movie's theatrical poster asks:  Whose fault is it if life doesn't go your way?

This German production, a crime drama/love story, directed by Gotz Spielmann has been described as ""about a bad person seeking good.""  The heart of the drama is as old as Hamlet's indecision and as modern as a classic noir story of a man who spirals down because of a woman.

Alex is an incompetent bouncer at a brothel who wants to get a fresh future with his hooker girlfriend Tamara.  But he needs some dough for his new life in a new place so he decides to rob a bank.  But of course things don't go as planned.  In fact they go very wrong when his girlfriend Tamara is almost killed by an unexpected cop who just happens to pass by.  Chance is fate's eternal companion.

Alex plans revenge on the cop and we participate in his exploration of getting even or reconciling.

4011037,5,B002XUL6MG,"I have been highly anticipating the release of G&ouml;tz Spielmann's wonderful film ""REVANCHE"" on Blu-ray.  His masterpiece has received mostly all positive reviews worldwide, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and fortunately for cinema fans, the Blu-ray and DVD release has been given The Criterion Collection treatment.

VIDEO:

""REVANCHE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 Aspect Ratio).  The film captures the beauty of the Austrian countryside, with the blue skies, clouds on top.  While green fields and lush vegetation and trees surround the area.  Colors are absolutely beautiful when focused on the countryside, but the we get to see the details of the seedy Vienna underground especially from the ""Cinderella"" brothel where Alex and Tamara works.  Red lighting is featured in the prostitute rooms and a different contrast to the warm, earthy colors of Robert and Susan's home.

Detail can be seen everywhere from old, painted walls of Hausner's home to the woods in the forest, the walls in Alex's apartment, the bark on the trees to the serene lakes as it ripples through wind or a rock hitting.  Blacks are nice and deep and skin tones are natural.  Cinematographer Martin Gschlacht captures nature quite vividly through his cinematography and looks absolutely beautiful.  But also a poetic and yet interesting way of filming certain scenes with the quick pans from character to character, pictured the way that Spielmann has thought of it in his mind (note: a special feature is included on the Blu-ray to show us Spielmann's approach to filmmaking and camerawork) and specifically knows how he wants things to be on screen.

The camerawork really catches your attention and of course, the choice of using 16mm instead of 32mm is quite intriguing but for the most part, for a film such as ""REVANCHE"", the film is detailed.  I didn't find any major compression artifacting, edge enhancement or banding.

According to The Criterion Collection, the transfer was approved by director G&ouml;tz Spielmann.  The high-definition digital transfer was created from the Super 16mm color negative which was scanned at 2K on a Northlight scanner and color graded on a Baselight EIGHT system.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the audio, the film is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film features a fully digital surround soundtrack in German.  Audio was mastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master files using Pro Tools HD.  Dialogue is crystal clear and certain scenes with Alex on his motorcycle or Robert at the shooting rage or firing shots from his gun are the primary sounds that catch your attention.  You occasionally hear the surrounding ambiance of the policemen talking to each other at the station in the background, the birds chirping in the field to the cows mooing inside the barn but for the most part, the film is dialogue driven.

Subtitles are provided in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""REVANCHE"" comes with the following special features:

  * G&ouml;tz Spielmann Interview - (35:32) A Criterion Collection exclusive interview with director G&ouml;tz Spielmann recorded in 2009.  Spielmann talks about being a director, his approach to filmmaking and more.
  * The Making of ""Revanche"" - (36:13) A documentary about ""REVANCHE"".  Behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film and interviews with cast and crew.
  * Foreign Land - (44:43) Director G&ouml;tz Spielman's debut short film from 1984.  The winner of a European Film Academy Award.  An optional director's introduction by Spielmann is included (3:31).
  * U.S. Trailer - (1:37) The U.S. original theatrical trailer.

EXTRAS:

  * 12-Page Booklet - Also, included is a 12-page insert booklet with an essay titled ""REVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"" by Armond White, film critic for the New York Press.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The word ""REVANCHE"" in German means ""revenge"" but also has the meaning of ""second chance"".

G&ouml;tz Spielmann manages to craft his masterpiece through utilizing these five characters in whose lives are intertwined after tragedy but not going through the cliched route of banality or a theme of built on misanthropy.  Each character at their own moral crossroads and each character brings something to the viewer.  Alex as a man in love and in a man in mourning.  Robert as a man who is proud but broken down by guilt.  Hausner as a man who knows he's growing older but seeing a side of his son that he has never seen before.  Susanne as a wife, who will do anything to save her marriage.  These characters are all vulnerable and must struggle with their own personal dilemmas.  Spielmann uses the theme of ""REVANCHE"" as a choice the character Alex will need to make.

The Criterion Collection once again brings a quality release.  For Spielmann fans, just to see the man in work while he is creating the film via the documentary included is quite wonderful.  Plus the addition of his debut short film is another plus in this release.  I have also been asked by my readers to let them know in my Criterion Collection reviews if I can mention if the films are family friendly films.  In ""REVANCHE"", this is definitely not a film to showcase in front of children as there is full frontal nudity and sexual themes in addition to some violence.

What makes this film work for me is that these Australian talents are people that I have never seen before in a film, they play their role remarkably well and the film is well-cast.  No one has this image of unbelievability.  Spielmann is able to craft a tale that captivates your attention from beginning to end through its characters but also the beautiful cinematography of the naturalistic surroundings of where these characters live but also capturing the seedy underground of Alex's and Tamara's life earlier in the film.

Overall, ""REVANCHE"" is compelling, smart and extraordinary film.  This is a true masterpiece for G&ouml;tz Spielmann and for the Criterion Collection, another magnificent Blu-ray release.  Highly recommended!",1267488000,,6020,5.0682281059063135
4011038,4,B002XUL6MG,"""Revanche"" is a self-contained character drama of revenge and redemption that invokes the time-honored theme of urban corrosion and rural salvation. Alex (Johannes Krisch) is an ex-con who works as an assistant in a Vienna brothel, where he finds love with a Ukrainian prostitute, Tamara (Irina Potapenko). Neither of them seem to have many options  or hopes of a brighter future. Tamara is offered a promotion of sorts by her sleazy boss (Hanno Poschl) that sets their story on a collision course with disaster and with Robert (Andreas Lust) and Susanne (Ursula Strauss), a police officer and his discontented wife who happen to be neighbors of Alex' grandfather Hausner (Johannes Thanheker) in the country village where he has a farm.

Though the threat of violence hangs over its characters, ""Revanche"" is a quiet, introverted drama. Writer/director Gotz Spielman has created four main characters who are all sympathetic, somehow emotionally distanced from one another, but not entirely innocent. They feel uncommonly authentic: well-intentioned and good enough that we feel for them but not victims in the conventional sense. I haven't seen the idea that country life is honest and emotionally curative expressed in a film in a long time, but it seems perfectly natural here. Hausner says of his grandson Alex, ""In the city you end up arrogant or a scoundrel."" It seems so, but what, then, will the country bring?

4011039,4,B002XUL6MG,"Call me jaded, but as someone who's studied film, been a film critic, and been a film enthusiast for years, one can't happen to notice that typically the Oscar for Foreign Language film goes to something ""heart-felt"" and ""sentimental"" versus ""depressing"" and ""minimailist.""  (And I promise I won't rant about the insanely outdated, ridiculous system that prevents many of the best foreign films from even being eligible for a nomination.)

In a way, this one film, is two very different parts in both mood and tone.  However, it is in fact, one linear storyline, that is separated by an event that occurs midway through the movie.  And by the time, it's done, seemingly different as the two components of the film may be, the whole is quite impressive and unique.

While everyone likes (and awards) the flashy performances, the ones I always find most satisfying are the restrained, carefully measured ones.  The lead actor here is singular in the sense that he is cold, hard, detached, and understated--as he should be--but he also some very intense emotional moments which are compounded upon impact by the fact that the viewer has become so accustomed to his usual demeanor.

Another unique component to this brilliant work, is that it has almost no music whatsoever.  No score, only a few isolated scenes with music as a necessary component.  It's all about the quiet moments, the words spoken, and the ambient nature sounds that sound rich, from even the most basic tv speakers.

""Revanche"" has some rather bold narrative and filmic approaches to its relatively traditional minimalism, observationism, and very otherwise typically European film sensibility.  It's a welcome fit to the Criterion Collection, and it would be a welcome addition to any cinemaphile's library.",1266624000,22,1776,5.089655172413793
