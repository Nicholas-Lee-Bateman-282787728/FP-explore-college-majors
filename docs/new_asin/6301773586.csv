351723,5,6301773586,"In watching this Movie, I was completely emersed in the lives of the Nolans.  Having lived at times as a child in some degree of poverty and rising above that, I have come to appreciate and relate to all the feelings  and desperation of all the characters involved.  This movie is a can't miss  tearjerker unlike other tearjerkers.  You find that you shed tears of hope  and spirit rather than those of pain.  Bravo to "" A tree grows in  Brooklyn!!""",918000000,2,449,4.45679012345679
351724,5,6301773586,"Heatbreakingly sad yet uplifting, this movie will definitely make you cry, but you'll still be glad you saw it.  It is not an ordinary tearjerker -- it's unsentimental, keen-eyed, and dead accurate not only about poverty but  also about family relationships.  A total winner -- my favorite movie from  the forties.",912816000,,314,5.098039215686274

351815,5,6301773586,"I have always caught this movie halfway through on Turner Classic Movies, so I am so glad I was able to find it and have a copy for myself.  This movie is based on one of my favorite books, and, from what I've seen of it, the film adaptation does the book a lot of justice.  This is a wonderful, heart-wrenching story of faith, courage, family, and perseverance during a time of struggle and challenges.  You will fall in love with Francie Nolan and wish you were more like her.  I can't wait to watch the whole film!",1507334400,,517,4.244897959183674
351816,5,6301773586,"I think it is strange that this classic has never had a sole U.S. release. (It was included in the Elia Kazan collection). It seems to have slipped through the cracks, but this Korean release is more than sufficient. I have a been a huge fan of the book by Betty Smith. This movie stops at the book 3/4 of the way through but I was quite satisfied. I have never seen a more poignant child actress than Peggy Ann Garner. She was heartbreaking in her emotional scenes and James Dunn deserved his Oscar for playing her doomed alcoholic father. It's hard to believe this was one of Dorothy McGuire's earliest films, she gives a flawless performance as Katie. I watch this film every Christmas season, there is an extended Christmas scene in the film, and it's a treat watching it that time of year. But it's great to watch anytime. One of my ten favorite films.",1506470400,2,857,4.464968152866242

351822,1,6301773586,"I just watched this on a whim with no prior expectations or knowledge--and what a dud of a movie this was. I cannot understand the near universal positive reviews. The one saving grace of this film was the father--he was the only enjoyable character and the writers killed him off half way through (randomly, I might add, so that you suspect they were searching for something, anything, to save the sinking ship that was the ""story"").
There is basically no plot. The main character, the mother, is a depressing figure. Come on, even in the depression era, people could still have emotions and be happy. Not one time do we see her smile. By 30 minutes in, you dread seeing her enter the scene.
All the acting is wooden and scripted. You could almost see script pages turning as the scenes unfold--which is a very bad thing for a movie.
Bottom line is that I was bored after 30 minutes and by 60 minutes I wanted to turn it off but for politeness sake left it on for family members.
This is simply a camera pointed at a fictional, unrealistic family in search of a story--but there isn't one, so the writer contrives a few things--dad randomly dies, check. Mother is ""hard up"" and never happy, check. She gets pregnant, check. Except, at no point did I like her, or her family, or care what happened to them. At no point did this film generate any emotion, or interest in the characters.
This is a truly bad movie. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on it.",1502236800,,1452,4.441947565543071

What a sweet, innocent time this was for our country --- second generation families struggling to make it in ""America"".

351896,5,6301773586,"This is a movie which could be depressing, but the actors and the script make it hopeful instead. It has the Kazan touch. He knew how to reach inside the characters and pull it all together. Poor, yes, but in love of each other and learning, they were not poor. this is a fmily who had self respect and did not shun hard work. I first saw it as a teen in the 60s, and still watch when it is on the movie channel. Peggy Ann Garner as the oldest daughter is stellar, deep beyond her young years. James Dunn is the charming alcoholic who loves his family, but just can't do right by them financially. Joan Blondell, Dorothy McGuire and Lloyd Nolan all give believable performances andy ou end up rooting for all of them.",1489104000,3,717,4.279411764705882

352093,5,6301773586,"This review refers to the DVD version with the green/black cover, which is an import from South Korea. When I ordered the DVD, the seller did not disclose that it was an import, but when it came in the mail, it was obvious by the foreign characters on the plastic packaging enclosing the DVD. I groaned when I saw it. I've had a couple of imports before and had some trouble viewing. Nevertheless, I opened it up and popped the DVD in my player. An ugly, black-and-white-with-green-shadows menu came up with only a couple of options (in English, thankfully). I clicked ""Play Movie"" and held my breath. The familiar 1940's-era Twentieth-Century Fox logo with the searchlights and familiar fanfare played, and the movie began. It was perfect---all-English dialogue, easy to hear and understand with a clear picture (of course it didn't have a restoration job). No subtitles were available, but none were needed; the audio was fine. There were no special features (scene selection was available), but who needs special features with a great, classic movie such as this one?",1454544000,,1070,4.95
352094,5,6301773586,The movie is a well adapted segment of a must read book.  The acting is superb.

This movie in particular touches just about all of my hot buttons when it comes to familial issues.  There's the poverty, the alcoholism and the social stigma that being poor places on the family.  As the alcoholic father, James Dunn seemed to have been transformed for the role.  He was completely convincing and deserving of the best actor Oscar .  This movie always stirs my own issues surrounding my alcoholic father, so be sure you are in a good place emotionally if you suffer from any of those issues in your own history.  Of course Dorothy Maguire and Peggy Ann Garner were also wonderful as were Joan Blondell and Lloyd Nolan.  I love this movie with all my heart.  It touches on every emotion: happiness, sadness, embarrassment, fear, loathing, pride, love and hate.  You get your money's worth, fof certain!  I HIGHLY recommend both movie and book!

352316,5,6301773586,"A simply wonderful movie based on a wonderful book.  Young Francie Nolan (Peggy Ann Garner), her little brother Neely (Ted Donaldson), stern mother Katie (Dorothy McGuire) and starry-eyed father Johnny (James Dunn) struggle to survive and thrive in turn-of-the-20th-Century Brooklyn.  There is next to nothing to fault in this movie, not the carefully nuanced characterizations and performances, the emotional tone of the movie, which goes from bright to solemn with just enough comic relief (largely supplied by Joan Blondell's spunky Aunt Sissy), nor Elia Kazan's direction which is ""deep"" both emotionally in the acting and intellectually in its understanding of class and the immigrant experience in America.  This is abetted by wonderful deep-focus cinematography, not only in the elaborate tenement setting the family is forced to live in, but also the much more affluent Brooklyn ""of homes and churches"" that grew up alongside the slums.  (Even Darryl Zanuck did himself proud on the elaborately realistic sets, both inside and out, and all fimed on the Fox lot.)

Movies made during the Second World War often fell prey to easy, sentimental tropes:  crooning priests, sashaying showgirls, insufferably noble parents and cute kids.  A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN does not.  It is honest, real, touching, and worth viewing more than once.  If possible, try to get the DVD edition that comes with the Elia Kazan boxed set, because it includes a sterling Commentary track including critic Richard Shickel, Kazan himself, and a grown-up Ted Donaldson.",1426982400,3,1549,5.341563786008231

352372,5,6301773586,"You wouldn't think a story with such a homey setting could be so powerful. But it is. The relationship between the young girl and her mother and father is complex and gut-wrenching. The father is so sympathetic, as the romantic with a heart of gold; yet so non-functional as a provider. And the mother is so compromised by being forced to be the provider, and having her attitude poisoned as a result. And the young girl is so sympathetic in her love for her father and her blindness to what her mother has to endure. At its core, the story is a conflict between romanticism and pragmatism, with the deck stacked and the judge (the young girl) completely incapable of accurately assessing the conflict. The film nearly falls apart at the end. Critical info about the circumstances of the father's death are absent, so we are left with important questions unanswered, such as a) how willful was his death, and b) what about the insurance policy? The insurance set-up is so carefully done that the absence of a pay-off suggests some editing or management interference at the last hour. But none of that really matters.",1417564800,,1116,4.728205128205128

Dorothy McGuire, the hard-working mother who shoulders it all and a pair of life-loving youngsters, one of which sees all and hears all and tries to make the best of it, if not sense. Poverty, yearning, striving for more, family, shunning charity and straining to maintain dignity.

352462,3,6301773586,"This movie was difficult to sit through for at least the first 100 minutes. Husband and father Johnny Nolan is an incredibly irresponsible provider - serving as a singer/waiter at once-in-awhile events while allowing his family to hover slightly above the poverty level and drinking far too much. All the while he's always voicing tiresome dreams to his family about how they'll do this and that 'when their ship comes in.' (Given his actions, viewers, and increasingly his wife as well, recognize that will never occur.)

Near the end he dies while trying to get a regular job as a highly-paid sand hog, and at his funeral his wife realizes how many people he had touched with his optimism. Fortunately, she ends up marrying a local policeman who is also a widower, and the family's financial problems are finally over.",1404259200,,820,4.857142857142857

You either cozy up to their poverty as Francie does, or you let it get to you and miss fully enjoying this masterpiece.  I don't know how to write this kind of material (reviews) or much else.  Describing 'what the play is about' has been done beautifully by most of the top reviews.  Professional stuff, truly impressive.  I just had to communicate to anybody that might read this, that I have and still do watch so  many movies.  And my eye(s) see many things that most people miss.

352593,5,6301773586,"The Betty Smith novel from which this movie is adapted, was one of my mother's favorite books; and since it was in her collection and readily available, it's one of the first books I read as a youngster. Mom loved movies too and I'm sure she went to see this when it first came out in 1945...but amazingly, today was the first time I've seen this exceptional film. The novel is divided into five books and this film roughly covers the events in Books 1, 3 and 4. It is a slice-of-life story of a second generation Irish-American family living in turn-of-the century (1912) Brooklyn. Katie and Johnny Nolan have two children; 13 year old Francie and 12 year old Neeley. Katie is the primary breadwinner, washing floors in the tenement where they live and collecting rags for sale. Johnny is an alcoholic singing waiter, who has trouble holding down a job. Francie is a sensitive and intelligent teen, a good student with a talent for writing. James Dunn, who plays Johnny was a leading man in his early career, but hit a rough patch, so this role which earned him an Oscar, was a huge comeback for him. Dorothy McGuire, who plays Katie, also delivers an inspired performance. But the best performance - arguably - is by child actor, Peggy Ann Garner, as Francie and she won a Juvenile Academy Award for her performance; but as with many gifted child actors, she never caught on as an adult. Also look for Joan Blondell as Aunt Sissie (Katie's sister); and Lloyd Nolan as Officer McShane, who befriends the family.

Peggy Ann Garner turns in an award-winning performance (winning the Academy Juvenile Award)as the determined young Francie who craves learning and is portrayed as an ardent reader, working her way alphabetically through the library catalogue. Francie loves her family, but especially adores her father, the happy-go-lucky alcoholic, Johnny Nolan (James Dunn) who is beloved by many but earns the displeasure of his weary wife, Katie (Dorothy McGuire) because of his inability to provide for his family. Katie takes on odd jobs, scrubbing floors in their tenement building, and collecting scraps of rags. Thanks to Katie's frugal and thrifty ways, the family makes do, but just barely.

The story follows the Nolan family through their hard times and makes for a compelling and heartbreaking watch as viewers witness the trials of a family making their way in the world. Francie is my favorite character in the movie - her steely determination, great love for her father, and her never ending quest to better herself and get a good education just resonated with me, and Peggy Ann Garner delivers a thoroughly convincing performance. Dorothy McGuire tears at one's heart through her credible portrayal of a long-suffering wife whose initial passion for her husband turns dour with the passage of time and whose outlook on life dims and becomes jaded by the practicalities of everyday living.

352739,5,6301773586,"Betty Smith's acclaimed 1940s novel is given a memorable and enduring treatment by director Elia Kazan, on his debut. The film works so well for an audience today, despite being rooted in a very specific time and place -- pre-war Brooklyn -- because its real concerns are universal. The contest or contrast between a dreamy, charming, alcoholic husband, who makes others feel good about life, and a practical mother, who runs the family and makes herself less attractive to others in her relentless pursuit of a decent living, could be transposed to any culture, any time. The cast are faultless. The mother, Dorothy McGuire (who Kazan apparently thought might be too refined for the part) is excellent as Mrs Catherine Nolan. She understands the role intimately and gets the acquired 'hardness' of the woman, determined to lift up her family's fortunes, just right. James Dunn picked up an Oscar for his performance as her husband. Who could deny him? He is totally believable in the part. Both children are excellent: in a sense they are at the core of the story (almost all the outdoor action concentrates on them) and the actors carry the story with charm and humour. There are a handful of films about family life lived at the fringes of poverty which, by striking a balance between joy and pain, have retained lasting value. This is one of them.

The Korean-made DVD provides a good image and sound from an unrestored but clean copy of the film. The liner notes are in English and there is a full suite of subtitles, if you need them. A good product.",1328227200,6,1556,4.74169741697417

352741,4,6301773586,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (20th Century Fox, 1945) was director Elia Kazan's debut film.

Thirteen-year-old Francie Nolan (Peggy Ann Garner) and her younger brother, Neeley (Ted Donaldson), live in a Brooklyn tenement in 1900. Their mother, Katie (Dorothy McGuire), struggles to keep the family afloat as their father, Johnny (James Dunn), an alcoholic, squanders his paychecks at the corner saloon. Johnny still dreams of being a famous singer but only finds irregular employment as a singing waiter. But he and Francie have a loving bond. Katie tries to shield her children from her free-spirited sister, Sissy (Joan Blondell), with mixed results. Officer McShane (Lloyd Nolan), the neighborhood flatfoot, assists the Nolans on a several occasions and takes a private shine to Katie.

Katie loves Johnny but has become hardened and embittered by his failures. She finally confronts him and brings his pipe dreams crashing to the ground.  When Francie, a bright girl, desires to attend a better public school in a nicer neighborhood, Johnny makes the arrangements by telling school officials she has moved in with relatives. It is the one thing Johnny can do for his daughter even if it is dishonest.

When Katie becomes pregnant, she moves the family upstairs to a cheaper apartment to save money. Johnny is so distraught he sits down at a piano left behind by the previous tenant and sings a tearful rendition of ""Annie Laurie,"" acknowledging the broken promise of his marriage.

The Nolans enjoy a few festive moments on Christmas Eve before Katie informs Johnny the children must drop out of school and go to work to help support the family. Crushed by the thought of Francie having to give up her dreams, Johnny walks out into the frigid winter night in search of steadier work.

After Johnny goes missing for a week, the family discovers he died of pneumonia after working on a tunnel digging crew. Although he was a drunk and a failure, the neighborhood deeply misses the affable Johnny, much to Katie's amazement. The saloon keeper offers the Nolan children part-time jobs so they are able to stay in school. While in labor, Katie reaches out to Francie and makes amends for her past coldness. Francie graduates from grammar school and Officer McShane proposes to Katie, offering the security Johnny was never able to provide.

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a thoroughly enjoyable film and a remarkable debut for Kazan. The cast is magical. Peggy Ann Garner is a complete delight in her Oscar-winning portrayal. Jimmy Dunn was also awarded a well-deserved Oscar. Dunn was a washed up alcoholic and was basically playing himself in the role. His ""Annie Laurie"" scene is extraordinary. Beautiful Dorothy McGuire gives a fine performance as practical, puritanical Katie although Kazan later complained she was too refined for the part. McGuire's natural beauty takes your breath away but the soft-spoken actress could surprisingly be a bit difficult on the set. As Peggy Ann Garner reflected much later, ""Kazan had a marvelous quality. He even knew how to handle Dorothy McGuire, and there was a certain way you had to handle that lady."" Joan Blondell is an audience pleaser as the coquettish Sissy, who is constantly after her sister to cut Johnny some slack. Even young Ted Donaldson is enjoyable as the grumpy Neeley. The settings and the performances are thoroughly realistic and evoke the rough and tumble environment of 1900 Brooklyn. Although Kazan dismissed A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as sentimental corn pone, the young director did a wonderful job telling a sweet story.

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a family film classic, amazingly is not available in the USA as an individual DVD but it is included as one of the fifteen films in the Elia Kazan Collection box set. A decent commentary is provided with analysis from Richard Schickel, Kazan, Ted Donaldson, and Norman Lloyd. Special features also include ""The Making of A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" documentary along with a look at one of Hollywood's loveliest actresses, ""An Appreciation of Dorothy McGuire.""

Kazan would go on to direct a total of nineteen movies. He is noted for introducing Stanislavski/Method acting into films and bringing a level of realism to the screen which was unknown up until that time. Kazan is remembered as the most important American director of his day, both on Broadway and in Hollywood. Two of his films, Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront are included in the American Film Institute's 1998 and 2007 lists of the Top 100 American Films. Kazan had raised the bar on filmmaking and strongly influenced the next generation of young directors. Several influential actors made their debuts in Kazan films including Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Warren Beatty. Kazan's testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 in which he named names of former members of the American Communist Party drew the undying ire of liberals and haunted the remainder of his career. Kazan was presented with an honorary Oscar in 1999 for his lifetime achievements in film despite protests from the Left. Elia Kazan passed away in 2003.",1315008000,4,5143,5.026995305164319

352800,5,6301773586,"An Elia Kazan Masterpiece yet to be released on DVD...

OK, OK... So what?  The film isn't as wonderful as the book.  They never are.  Because the book is lengthy and takes place from before Francie is born untll after she is 16 years old, the movie concentrates on Francie as a teenager ages 14 - 15.  Also one of Katie's sisters is eliminated and her qualities and quotes from the book are giving to Sissy, somewhat toning down her character. Other characters, like Francie's school teacher, are changed to protagonists to ease the transition to film.

However, Elia Kazan's masterpiece with Dorothy McGuire as Katie Nolan, the hard as nails mamma, Joan Blondell as the effervescent, fun loving aunt Sissy, Oscar award winning James Dunn as Johnny Nolan, the drunkard pipe-dreaming father and little Peggy Ann Garner was so wonderful as the young, sweet and sensitive Francie. Thankfully,  the Academy gave her an Oscar for Most Promising Juvenile Performer in the year of our Lord 1945.

352861,4,6301773586,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn doesn't have a special story; it is one we have all heard before. The Nolans are a poor but close family plagued with the problems of everyday life. Francie (Peggy Ann Garner) is a dreamer who idolizes her ambitious but untalented father (James Dunn). Her mother Katie (Dorothy McGuire) obviously loves her daughter and her husband, but she doesn't understand them and wonders how valuable the art of imagination really is. She relates more strongly to her son Neeley (Ted Donaldson) It is eccentric Aunt Sissy (Joan Blondell) who is often the voice of reason for the family.

Not only does this film comment on the relationships between families, it also shows what life was like in poor neighborhoods in New York during this time period. We see that children leave the house with little or no adult supervision, doors are left unlocked, neighbors know each other, and schools are much more rigid.

A good commentary on people and growing up, this is a film sure to be remembered for its outstanding performances, especially that of Garner.",1186876800,3,1066,4.851648351648351
352862,5,6301773586,"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn portrays the life of a poor working class family in Brooklyn circa 1900. This sensitive portrayal boasts superlative acting and great sets; the plots moves along at a good pace to keep your interest, too.

The action unfolds as the Nolans continue their struggle against the odds to keep things afloat financially. Katie Nolan (Dorothy McGuire) is the tough as nails mother who must work like a slave because her pipe dreaming alcoholic husband Johnny (James Dunn) can't find steady work to support the family. Of course this puts a strain on their marriage and sometimes the children Francie (Peggy Ann Garner) and Neeley (Ted Donaldson) have to go without much nurturing from their busy and preoccupied parents. When Johnny does arrange for Francie to go to a better school, however, we see his true desire to provide for his children despite his personal shortcomings. At times Katie Nolan seems so hard as nails you would wonder who would have ever wanted to stay married to her! Katie appears all the rougher as contrasted with her relatively carefree and independent thinker sister Sissy, played to perfection by Joan Blondell.

Family life in the tenement doesn't offer much hope although this family, stronger than they would initially appear to be, fight to keep a halfway decent standard of living. The cutting down of the only tree they can see from the rear windows of their tenement apartment symbolizes the incredible uphill battle they face to stay afloat.

Many questions arise: Will Katie and Sissy, the two sisters, be able to get along any better than Katie and her husband Johnny do? What about Francie--will she be required to grow up prematurely because of the events that happen to her family in this movie? Will Neeley be able to rise to the occasion to help his family despite his tender age? No spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to get the movie and watch to find out!

Peggy Ann Garner gives a stunning performance as Francie Nolan; there were times near the end of the film when I had to wipe tears from my eyes--and I never cry! It's a shame she didn't become more of a movie star; her portrayal of Francie leaves nothing to be desired--she deserved the Oscar she won for this role.

The cinematography is great in scenes including the one early on when the only tree they have is cut down; and the choreography shines in scenes like the Christmas tree ""giveaway"" on Christmas Eve when it becomes too late to sell the trees and Francie and Neeley try to win a tree.

Overall, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a masterpiece directed by Elia Kazan. The convincing acting stuns you and makes the movie remarkably heartrending.

I highly recommend this film for fans of classic movies and people who enjoy classic drama will enjoy this film as well.",1186358400,,2799,4.746913580246914
352863,5,6301773586,"This is a very good movie.

352904,4,6301773586,"""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is about a struggling Irish family in turn of the (20th) Century Brooklyn. The key figure is the hard working mother (Dorothy McGuire), holding her brood together in the face her shiftless, alcoholic husband (James Dunn).  This reviewer remembers the movie being considerably softer on the old man than the earthier novel by Betty Smith.  In fact, this observer thought the movie to be quite optimistic in comparison. There are solid performances throughout TGB: The strongest are on the distaff side. McGuire is first rate as the often stern mom, old before her time, keeping things in hand. Peggy Ann Garner is wonderful, as Francie, a dreamer of a child and a practical young woman all at once. Joan Blondell provides spunk as Aunt Sissy, McGuire's sister. She steals most of her scenes.  Among the males Lloyd Nolan is perfect as the neighborhood Irish cop and James Gleason briefly shines as a gruff but sturdy bar owner.  TGB did well at Oscar time; James Dunn won a statue for his role as the Father, and Garner won a special award. TGB also took an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  This reviewer would have nominated Blondell for playing the sassy Sissy. The bottom line is that TGB is a winning film about an ordinary family surviving in a difficult, if not tragic, situation. It is very pleasant viewing. Other reviewers have carped about comparisons to the more serious book. Viewers are urged to take both on their own terms; each can stand alone.  A final observation:  TGB is yet another in a lengthy set of examples of why old black and white releases should not be colorized.  It is just fine the way it is; no adornments are needed.",1161216000,9,1679,4.706484641638225

352908,5,6301773586,"This is my all-time favorite film which explains why there is nothing negative I can say about it, only the way its star was treated and the absence of a DVD of this (although it was recently released in Europe, but it's not available in North America, which is a crime).

GOOD NEWS: 1 - This one of the greatest acting jobs by a child in the HISTORY of motion pictures. Peggy Ann Garner, as ""Francie,"" was incredible. The adults may get top billing but Garner is the show here, start to finish. She is a real pro, not just with her lines but with her facial expressions. If this young girl doesn't bring a tear or two to your eyes, then get some counseling!! She was so impressive that she was given a special Academy Award for her performance: 2 - It''s a powerful story which is a big reason the book, by Betty Smith, has been a best-seller for almost 60 years. 3 - One of Hollywood's more likable guys, James Dunn, is perfect as Francie's father and who could criticize anything Dorothy McGuire did in this film? 4 - Joan Blondell also was a great choice to play the sassy Aunt Sissy. 5 - Ted Nolan is very funny as Francie's younger brother. Notice the kid is eating in almost every scene. He adds needed humor to the movie. He hardly gets a notice when people discuss this film, and that's unfortunate.

BAD NEWS: 1 - Hollywood ignored Garner's acting talent shortly after this film and ruined what could have been a tremendous acting career. 2 - Fox Studio Classics announced that this was finally going to be out on DVD on Feb. 22, 2005, and then yanked the disc at the last minute with no explanation. So, we are still waiting to see a better print of this in the United States, although the VHS versions are decent.",1145664000,11,1725,4.354037267080745
352909,5,6301773586,"Though a bit fast-paced and somewhat similar in style to a stage play, this movie very much brings Betty Smith's characters and their plights to life and does not leave us wishing they had treated the written work with more care. My mother was born and raised as a city girl, and her descriptions of growing up in Philadelphia remind me of this portrayal of life in Brooklyn. I very much envision a reflection of many things my mother described about her childhood in this movie. For example, that some children she grew up with had never seen a cow. A parallel of this exists in the film when Francie writes about going to see cotton fields. The longing behind this is very similar to the stories my mother related to me.

The opposites attract theory is wonderfully done in this story, and I ache for Dorothy McGuire's character, and her struggles, especially her iron will to do what is right for her family's survival. The conflict of Pipedreamer versus Realist is well balanced, so that we are not judgmental of either's actions. The interplay between the characters leads nicely to the heart wrenching loss of one and the anguish of the other over what could have been done differently. The devastating effects of alcoholism are featured in this film, but in contrast with a strong element of hope. Additionally, the reality of the numbers of children born at home and the infant mortality rate of the time period are also presented, but not stressed so overwhelmingly as to take away from the happiness of the new additions to the family and the positive direction of their future.

Joan Blondell's portrayal of Aunt Sissy is my favorite part of this movie. She is charming, funny, steadfast, quirky, and absolutely perfect.

What is interesting about this film in comparison to the book is that only about two-thirds of the family's story is told. I would definitely recommend reading the novel if you want to know about Francie and Neeley as far as their careers after graduation, and what happens to the rest of the family. The book also goes into much greater detail as far as the extent of the struggle with poverty and the multitudes of families who experience similar situations. For those who enjoy this movie, I also recommend I Remember Mama.

Fox had scheduled it for release in 2004 and then pulled it. Why? I believe the reason is that they sub-leased this title for release in Europe and thus can not release it until the lease runs out. They are not interested in putting it out in just a Region 1 version, so will hold off until all rights revert back to them. Too bad as this is one that I would dearly like not only to have, but to share with others.

The relationship between Francie and her father is beautifully depicted and is one of the best things about the movie.

The movie is ripe for sentimentality, but it's a credit to director Elia Kazan (his first movie) that it never stoops to that level. In fact, the movie is filled with very realistic scenes, filmed with both eyes wide open: a woman (and her baby) is stoned for being an unwed mother, and after Francie is molested Katie shoots her attacker. The last 20 minutes are a bit of a letdown, but the acting and script (by Tess Slesinger and Frank Davis) are first-rate and engrossing.

It's a simple story about a poor family, a timeless story that will ring true to millions of families around the world, similar in type to movies like I Remember Mama, The Human Comedy, and Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, but more serious, and in my opinion even more insightful than those fine films.

Every actor in the film rose to the occasion, bringing the character's of Betty Smith's novel to life with fidelity and veracity, depth and breadth, in several cases giving the best performance of a lifetime.

352998,5,6301773586,"Betty Smith's heartfelt and timeless novel of a young girl's passage through her youth in the Brooklyn slums was transformed by director Elia Kazan into one of the most touching and deeply felt films ever made. It has that rare ability to break your heart one moment and make you smile the next. There is a tenderness here that has rarely been captured on film. Many point to Elia Kazan's flashier films, but it was this sentimental film that was his crowning achievement. There are moments in this film when even those who never cry at the movies will be moved to tears.

Peggy Ann Garner was so wonderful as the young and sensitive Francie, the Academy gave her an Oscar for Most Promising Juvenile Performer. James Dunn garnered an Oscar also as Francie's loving father, Johnny Nolan, a singing waiter with a gift for dreaming he passes on to Francie, who wants to be a writer. Francie's papa makes their hard life worth living and she worships him. He understands and adores her.

But when he isn't working, Johnny is usually drunk. Everyone in their poor neighborhood knows Johnny is a good man, however, and loves and respects him. He is the one who will find a way for Francie to attend the school she dreams of, even though it is far from their home. Francie's mother is the only one who doesn't seem to see how special Johnny is.

Dorothy McGuire gives another terrific performance as Francie's hard working mother, Katie, who tries desparately not to love her boy Neely more than Francie, and fails; tries desparately not to become bitter with the charming lad she married in her youth, but can't; and tries desparately not to let her heart grow cold and hard, and fails once more.

Francie and her family may live in poverty, but Kazan takes the time to show the joy that can be found in the small things in life. For Francie, her father represents happiness and living. Joan Blondell, as Katie's sister and Francie's aunt Sissy, with her free spirit and big heart, adds to Francie's joy in life. It is one of Blondell's finest roles.

It is Peggy Ann Garner's emotional performance, however, you will always remember. She brings a sweetness and sincerity to Francie that makes her unforgettable. Purchasing this film is an opportunity to own one of the true masterpieces in American cinema. It will touch your heart and remind you what Hollywood was once capable of, and make you wonder where it all went wrong.",1112054400,162,2423,4.665105386416862

prize has to go to Peggy Ann Garner in A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.

The movie is seen through her eyes and she is wonderful throughoutit.  We see her going to the library, reading all the books there.  We see her hoping with her father that a big impressario will discover him and take them out of their poverty.  We see her dreams shattered when she realizes she might have to leave school. Garner is not the only gem in this movie.  A beautiful performance by Dorothy McGuire complements Garner's.  James Dunn won an Oscar for his finely etched performance as Johnny Nolan whose dreams nearly destroy his family.  There are also fine performances by Joan Blondell and Lloyd Nolan.

353001,5,6301773586,"Hollywood was horrible to poor Peggy Ann Garner, but it provided her with at least one vehicle for the rage and inner torment that eventually destroyed her.  As Francie Nolan in Elia Kazan's first film A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, she comes close to tearing up the screen as a young girl trapped in class anxiety with foolish hopes and dreams that get shattered on a regular basis.  If you think Margaret O'Brien shows childhood neurosis in the Halloween scene of MEET ME IN ST LOUIS, she's a cold fish compared to the tears shed by Garner in nearly every act of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.  The wrenching performances Kazan later eked out of Brando, Dean, Clift are here foreshadowed by a child's desperate search for a better way of life.

After the film was released, Peggy Ann was briefly famous and valued, but her grip on reality was never very strong, and she was deeply hurt when prettier, less talented girls were picked for the parts she really wanted, and her life became a vale of tears.  Knowing this, it's especially difficult to watch A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN knowing her few smiles, and her joy in the company of her father when sober, are but rare occlusions on a life based in misery.",1092787200,16,1197,4.523148148148148

Poverty in Brooklyn.  A father who is a dreamer but who will die for his family, a mother who was sweet and cheerful whose heart becomes callous through struggle and hardships, and two adolescents trying to live and survive in proverty in Brooklyn.

Everyone in the neighborhood adores the father, he is a nice man, he just drinks too much.  And the daughter adores and admires him more than anyone. He's a great story-teller and is the one person who encourages her to dream big.
The wife, she loves her husband but despises his weakness for drinking. His drinking also keeps him from steady work and the  family constantly stuggles to get by.

As Francine, Peggy Ann Garner plays her role with an amazing display of natural unaffected intelligence uncommon in child actors of her era; hers is a wonderfully tear-jerking performance.  Dorothy McGuire is fine as Francine's long-suffering mother Katie (something about her seemed a bit too classy for her character at times, but nothing to wreck another excellent portrayal).  As the illiterate, rather loose-loving - and intensely likeable - Aunt Cissy, Joan Blondell does justice to her role.  Blondell later wrote that there was originally a scene where children were playing outside on the street and find a tin full of condoms; curious, they went to Cissy for explainations. Blondell claimed the scene in which she lovingly explained about life and love to the children was the best she ever did - naturally, it was deemed too distasteful for release! As Johnny, the alcoholic singing waiter father whom Francine adores, James Dunn won himself a deserved AA.

Long ago I gave up expecting the same things from my favorite films as from my favorite books.  They are simply separate and should be viewed as cousins rather than siblings.  I also refuse to see a movie version of a book that is close to my heart (two examples: _The Handmaid's Tale_ and _Housekeeping_).
Just my two cents.",1009584000,9,486,4.449438202247191
353049,5,6301773586,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a movie that will hit a lot of people in many ways.  For me, it is a reminder of my strong willed mother, alcoholic father and free-spirited brother.  I think, like Francie, I was my father's friend more than I was his son.  I would listen to his stories, wait up for my parents when they had gone to a party to make sure they got home ok, listen to my mother raking my father for his drinking and cringing as dad just sat there.

The casting is outstanding and makes the movie work.  Not just the major roles, but the smaller ones too are exceptionally casted.  Put someone else in as the junkman and it might not work as well.  Another person in the role of the doctor signing the death certificate may leave a different and lesser impression.  Lloyn Nolan, Dorothy McGuire and James Dunn were all inspiried choices.  Joan Blondell was a brilliant choice as Aunt Sissy, her of many husbands but still with a element of humanity that has stuck with her.

There are many memorable scenes but some have a deeper and lasting meaning.  A young girl named Flossie is showing off her new dress to all passers by.  After a few moments it is apparent that Flossie is not well.  Later when we learn she has died, McGuire tells Dunn that she'll have to buried in potter's field. Dunn hits the right tone, as in a resolute voice he reminds his wife that her parents did the right thing while she was alive by getting her new dresses.  Good for dad!

The other scene that hits me every time I see it, is the scene when after dad has died, Francie goes around and collects his shaving mug from the barber and puts it is a box under her bed.  She still has a part of him!

Dad's posthumous graduation gift to Francie is one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed.  Blondell outdoes herself as the supporting and careing adult sharing a little girls bottled up grief.

Where I live in Japan now, Annie Laurie is used as a song for an advertisement.  When I hear the music and words, I don't think of the product but of the scene in the movie when Dunn learns they have inherited a piano from the previous room tenent and is playing and singing Annie Laurie.  Pieces such as this stick in my mind.

Some will say that the movie doesn't include everything from the book and that is lacks the gritty poverty, that it is a rather stilted happy ending.  They have a point but folks, get into the characters, feel what they are trying to project and you'll come away from the movie a better person for having seen it.

353100,3,6301773586,"After I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, one of my favorite books, about ten times, I finally found out that it had been made into a movie. I went out to rent it from the movie store with great enthusiasm, and I popped it into the VCR as soon as I got home. To my intense disappointment, the movie wasn't even half as good as the book.
For one, because the movie was edited from a PG-13 book to G movie, a lot of the more poignant, moving, and disturbing parts of the book were taken out. Unfortunately for the movie, many of the scenes that were taken out made the book all the better.
Also, the movie toned down the terrible atmosphere in which Francie lived. There was no mention of the beatings and other cruelty of the teachers, no mention of violence that existed in the neighborhood, and downplayed Francie's (the main character's) struggle to overcome adversity and get an education.
Lastly, the thing that cheapened the movie the most for me, was the ""inclusion"" of the tree. In the book, the tree had subtle symbolic overtones and could be interpreted to represent Francie's life. The tree became a moving part of the story. Betty Smith, the author, gracefully included it. However, in the movie, the tree was shoddily dealt with. I vividly remember Francie's father telling her to ""look at that tree, struggling to grow out of concrete. Be like that tree. Never give up."" I groaned audibly at that contrived line.
Although the movie is okay, it was a big disappoinment for me after reading the book. I would recommend anyone who liked the movie to read the book.",1000425600,8,1571,4.535211267605634
353101,2,6301773586,"Perhaps A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a novel where characterisation and the inward thoughts of characters is so powerful, would be difficult to adapt to film in any case. Yet this version (while not as distorted as the 1980s one) is hugely disappointing.

Francie Nolan is a complex character - one of a family of survivors in circumstances which range from sordid to deeply moving. The film version borrows some of a character's traits, yet leaves out those which are most telling. For example, for all of Katie's toughness and bitterness, the book shows us that she is a ""vivid conversationalist,"" and one who can laugh at a matinee or enjoy a picnic excursion. Here, Katie seems to border on a shrew. Nor is it Katie alone who suffers this treatment: Sissy, also complex and beautifully drawn in the original, is largely ""re-worked,"" and, while the book does not gloss over Johnny's alcoholism, he is handsome, charming, and lovable, where the film leaves one wondering how Katie found him attractive.

If the characters are diminished, much to the film's detriment, some of the setting seems a bit too charming. Hungry, shivering Francie, who has suffered much from the sordid side of life, seems a bit prissy, and far more fortunate, in this depiction. It is as if the rags she and Neeley dragged to the seller each Saturday have been starched and ironed.

The book is especially powerful because it shows the reader the intricacy, and both the beauty and pain, of all sorts of loving relationships. Shying away from the inherent complexity, this just seems a rather dull group in a poor neighbourhood. The film, by contrast, is far too ""pat,"" and no stimulation to mind or heart.

353103,5,6301773586,"It's easy to see why critics and the public are torn about Elia Kazan. On one hand he ""named names"" during the McCarthy era, on the other hand his body of work is so distinguished that even his detractors must give the devil his due.
How to make a story about a little girl growing up poor in Brooklyn with her little brother, lovable, feckless, alcoholic daddy and her desperately conscientious but humorless mother, without resorting to bathos?  It's a tightrope I don't think Capra could manage.  Imagining Margaret O'Brien as the little girl makes me cringe. Instead, Kazan chose Peggy Ann Garner, who doesn't hit a false note. Same with James Dunn, who won an Oscar for his ""daddy."" And Dorothy McGuire, as the mother, succeeds in the difficult job of gaining sympathy for an unsympathetic character.
The ending is bitter-sweet and without melodrama, so that what hits you at the end is not the climax but the totality of the story.

  Though... the person who  plays Francie is a great character, hitting Francie with the right notes I  thought she'd look like, act like. Neeley is good too and I could tell  who's who.
