3010769,5,B000Y11BCG,"Both of these movies are great comedy classics that you will enjoy and watch over and over again. If you like movies that make you laugh and appreciate the talented acting skills of Bette Midler, Richard Dreyfuss and Danny Devito, then you should have these in your DVD library.

3010788,5,B000Y11BCG,Was trying to fill out my collection and get rid of the VHS tapes (soooo 70's).  These were two on the list and I got the for the price of one!!,1376438400,,144,3.6451612903225805
3010789,3,B000Y11BCG,"Ruthless People is something of a favourite of mine, so I would give it four stars.  It is pure comedy with very little depth but good performances all round within the limits of the genre.

Down and out in Beverly Hills was a disappointment.  There are several comedy moments but it can't work out whether it wants to be slapstick or social satire and ends up being neither.  Not something I would want to put on again.

As usual the film arrived well inside the estimated time.",1372291200,,479,4.459770114942529
3010790,4,B000Y11BCG,I enjoyed seeing these movies when they were in the Theatre.  They are a wonderful additions to my movie collection. I will share them  with a new audience. Great comedies for all.,1370908800,,180,4.59375

3010795,2,B000Y11BCG,"I thought Ruthless People was hilarious.  Good cast, well acted.  A ""nice couple"" kidnap a rich woman only to find her husband doesn't want her back.
I did not like ""Down  and out in Beverly Hills"". It has a great cast but the plot and script is horrible!  It was so overdone, I just found it stupid not funny.",1348099200,,310,4.203389830508475
3010796,5,B000Y11BCG,"Ruthless People is fantastically funny and entertaining movie. An all star cast with Bette Midler and Danny Divito heading the crew. Laugh out loud rediculously funny. Not a kids movie though as there is a lot of bad language.
Down and Out in Beverly Hills is another all star cast with Bette Midler and Nick Nolte heading the crew. Nolte plays a homeless guy that comes into a posh home in Beverly Hills after the husband saves him from trying to commit suicide in their pool. Turns out the bum has a lot to teach this wildly out of touch family. This is a heart warming, funny, sad and truly entertaining film that is sure to be a family favorite.",1327881600,,649,4.416666666666667
