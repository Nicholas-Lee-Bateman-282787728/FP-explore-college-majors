4124229,4,B003H8F2VE,"This movie is a sequel to the first movie ""Santa Baby"". I found it to be good for a sequel. Most sequel are usually better than the original because the makers can embellish the story based on the first.",1326672000,2,203,4.230769230769231

4124233,1,B003H8F2VE,"I loved Santa Baby 1.  It was a good Christmas flick.  I don't know what happened here.  No offense.  The actors were great.  They were just the wrong actors.  If they could have stuck with the original cast it would have been much better.  I ordered this on Amazon, and found it on Netflix to view for free.  I started watching it, 20 minutes later decided I had made an ""accidental"" purchase.  Sending it back.",1294358400,,412,4.386666666666667

4124260,1,B003H8F2VE,"DVD received was NOT Widescreen!
DVD I received is in the old 4:3 (screen ratio) narrow screen format; the same as your old 1950's TV screen, NOT Widescreen as in Amazon description.
I'm surprised that any widescreen movie made in 2009 is released to DVD in the old 4:3 screen ratio format!
I discovered that there is a German released DVD version in widescreen which makes no sense at all.
Please note: The widescreen region 2 German version will not play in region 1 USA players!",1453161600,,481,4.604651162790698

4124275,4,B003H8F2VE,"Not as good, perhaps, as Santa Baby, but it is a very nice sequel indeed.  Mary Class (Jenny McCarthy) has to return to the North Pole when her father decides to give up being Santa and goes off to find himself.  She was planning to do that anyway, but was busy with other things -- she is wonderful at multi-tasking.  But when she gets to the Pole she finds that there are lots of problems, more than the last time.

  It is a pleasant movie and it is great to see the elves and other characters returning.  If you liked the first one, and/or you like movies about Santa, this one should appeal to you.",1421798400,,603,4.191304347826087

4124279,4,B003H8F2VE,"Finally got the chance to see both Santa Baby 1(2006) and 2(2009)and I must say,I am impressed. Jenny Mc Carthy did a pretty good job playing Mary Class,Santa's daughter of course. She changed her last name from Claus to Class (probably)to fit it in the big city and so as not to be associated with Santa Claus. It wasn't mentioned in the movie why only that Mary changed it. Anyway,most of the original cast came back except Santa himself which was originally played by George Wendt and in this sequel by Paul Sorvino. Luke is played by Dean McDermott,originally played by Ivan Sergei. Mrs. Claus is as delightful and Gary the Elf with his facial expressions kind of remind me of Mr. Bean. I still like the first one but this sequel doesn't disappoint. Santa Baby 1&2 are one of the best movies of ABC Family's 25 Days of Christmas not to mention Mistletones (Tia Mowry,Tori Spelling)and Holidaze (Jennie Garth).Will definitely add these movies to my collection.",1419984000,,963,4.772455089820359
4124290,4,B003H8F2VE,"Didn't like this one as much as the first, but still it was a good entertaining Christmas film for the whole family.  New boyfriend and new Santa, but both do a good job.  Jenny McCarthy returns as Mary Class trying to keep the family business going.  This one actually had two plots going.  First and the one I didn't care for, has Santa deciding to quit the business and become a hippy jazz musician to do his own thing and be his real self.  The second plot has Terry (Kelly Stables) a newcomer to the North Pole out to sabotage Mary and move in and take over the North Pole for herself.  A cute holiday tale and well worth a watch for the family.",1419552000,,650,4.201612903225806

4124318,4,B003H8F2VE,"I enjoyed the first installment more, but then that is the norm, right? Jenny McCarthy does a great job as Santa Claus' daughter and Dean McDermott does a great job as her husband. I love the atmosphere portrayed in the ""north pole"", with the decorations and the elves and all of the activity. Santa wants to travel with his newly formed band, he's tired, so his daughter, a successful business woman, tries to incorporate new ideas which end up in disaster. Not to worry though, everything always works out at Christmas. I watch both Santa Baby and Santa Baby 2 every year.",1388016000,,574,4.637254901960785
