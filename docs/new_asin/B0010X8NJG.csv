8239073,4,B0010X8NJG,"This disc contains episodes 19-22 and it does not disappoint.  The episodes are mainly focused on the school sports event that lasts for 3 episodes (counting episode 23 which concludes the event).  The episodes before that (19 & 20) focus on the misunderstanding between Harima and Hanai as Yakumo stumbles upon Harima's manga and becomes the first person outside of a publishing company to see his work.  Also, you don't want to miss out on Hanai having a mock wedding with Yakumo.  The comedy still works even after 19 episodes of school rumble, though some things are similar and a bit repetitive (hence the reason for -1 star) but I found this volume to be enjoyable as the last one (which IMO was the best volume thus far).  Simply put, volume 5 does not disappoint as you will find out some interesting developments and you will also want to know how the 1st season concludes in the upcoming final volume (of course you will also want to know how the sports events folded and what happens between Harima and Eri).  That concludes the review, make sure you buy the last volume as it will wrap the 1st season of School Rumble and check out my review for the final DVD volume as well.",1203379200,,1187,4.549295774647887
