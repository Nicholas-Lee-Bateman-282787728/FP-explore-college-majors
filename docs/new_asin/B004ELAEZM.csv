8427172,5,B004ELAEZM,"It's all of Season 4 of ""The Wild Thornberrys"" in one volume (unlike seasons 2 and 3). However, you only get 2 discs and 6 episodes. The reason I still give it 5 stars is because you will find out just who Donnie Thornberry really is! Is he realated to the Thornberry's at all? Is he really just a ""Jungle-Boy"" as Debbie Thornberry always calls him? Purchase this box set and find out...

Now, here are the episodes you will receive:

Disc 1
-The Origin of Donnie: Part 1
-The Origin of Donnie: Part 2
-The Origin of Donnie: Part 3

Disc 2
-The Origin of Donnie: Part 4
-The Trouble with Darwin
-Hot Air

I bet you thought that there was going to be an ""Origin of Donnie: Part 5,"" but I bet the cartoonists got tired with the storyline and decided to finish it in 4 parts.

Now, here are the DVD specifications for you:

2001-02/COLOR/141 MIN/NOT RATED/ANIMATED/FULL SCREEN

Yes, it is expensive at close to $40.00 for only 6 episodes (that's $6.67 for each episode!), however you will add to you ""The Wild Thornberrys"" collection as I did and you will learn just who Donnie Thornberry, if he is a Thornberry, really is!

So, who is Donnie???",1306800000,,1142,4.404761904761905
8427173,5,B004ELAEZM,"This was one of my favorite shows, even though I was twenty-something when it first aired.  One of my favorite aspects of this show is how we get to travel around the world with Eliza and her family, experiencing different cultures, customs and sometimes languages.  I think I'd have loved this show even without the fascinating 'talking to animals' thing.

This is a great series for getting people interested in other parts of our world.  I also deeply appreciate the way it makes you care about animals/the environment, not in a preachy sort of way, but YOU care because ELIZA and her family care, to the point of being willing to risk their lives.

There is also an awesome movie you absolutely cannot miss out on-it's a whole lot less expensive than the series, and is a good starting point if you want to try a bit of the series before jumping in the water.  You won't be sorry!",1306800000,,884,4.528301886792453
8427174,2,B004ELAEZM,"I have not purchased this dvd. But I think it is ridiculous that it costs $40 for only 6 episodes! When I bought the 20 episode first season for only $35. I want to get this season, but I do not want to pay that much money for only a few episodes.. amazon, please bring down the price! And as for seasons 2 and 3, why are they not available anymore!??? They have only been out for less than two months!! I am really disappointed amazon!!! I hope that you bring the seasons back! Because I cant imagine why some seasons are unavailable so soon after being released. Especially since it IS burn on demand.",1295481600,9,603,4.252173913043478
