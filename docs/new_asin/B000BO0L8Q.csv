2431668,5,B000BO0L8Q,"Phil is one of those movies goofy enought to be a crack-up. The odd array of characters and the characterizations keep the show rolling, it's one I gotta see again and probably routinely herefafter. Watch out for the Beaver!",1352851200,,224,4.769230769230769
2431669,4,B000BO0L8Q,"I picked this one up for $2.89 including shipping. It's a low-budget film but is really very good. I have watched this thing 3 times so far. ""Shut Up Beaver,"" too funny. I have had zero problems with the disc and will probably watch this again with the wife this weekend. Pop some corn and enjoy!!",1340323200,2,297,4.321428571428571
2431670,2,B000BO0L8Q,"An alien crash-lands in the Canadian woods. He's not too bright, enjoys getting drunk, is fearful, and entertains his new Earth friends by levitating objects. Meanwhile, the US military wants to capture or kill him.

I don't know where all these 5 star reviews are coming from. PHIL THE ALIEN is a low-budget Canadian TV movie (it's credited to Canadian Telefilm). Most of the story is set at the Canadian Tavern. The characters later visit the Canadian Motel.

I think those names are supposed to satirize the Canadian government's heavy-handed pressure to fill Canadian-funded productions with ""Canadian content."" That was the satirical target of the brilliant SCTV's ""Great White North"" skits.

But PHIL THE ALIEN is no SCTV. Its satirical targets are very old and/or very politically correct: drunks, Christians, gun-toting rednecks, bickering garage bands, evil American military/intelligence operatives.

PHIL THE ALIEN is not a horrible film, it's just not very good. I smiled a few times, but no laugh-out-loud moments. The actors feel as if they're just going through the motions. One-dimensional performances with no emotional depth.

I bought PHIL THE ALIEN on Amazon, a brand new copy for one penny. I guess that was a fair price.",1333584000,,1242,5.221105527638191
2431671,4,B000BO0L8Q,"as the other reviewers have mentioned, it's about alien who crash lands in northern ontario, meets a boy, discovers booze, couchsurfs in a talking beaver's den, becomes a raging alcoholic, gets thrown in jail, embraces christianity, starts helping people and takes a trip to niagara falls with his disciples while being pursued by some secret alien hunting organization. it's a bargain at $5.49. probably rated pg-13 for drinking, cussing and visits to a bordello. features graham greene as a bartender and joe flaherty as the talking beaver.",1300406400,2,542,5.241379310344827
2431672,5,B000BO0L8Q,"I loved this movie.  It's funny, quirky, interesting, engaging...  I'm a huge fan of Monty Python, Mel Brooks, Trey Parker/Matt Stone films and this one is, to me, in that same vein.  If you love intelligent, funny, interesting comedies, this is for you!  If not, then you obviously don't have good taste in movies.  Plus, from seeing this movie and ""Suck,"" the guy (Rob Stefaniuk) is obviously a talented musician--in addition to being a talented writer and director--and anyone who appreciates good music (like Rush) is a great person in my book!  I particularly loved the part when ""Phil"" is singing the blues in his ""native"" language, but we get it...the blues is the blues.  You don't have to understand the words, it's the emotion being conveyed.  When he comes off stage and one of the local ""good 'ole boys says, ""Damn, he's good!"" you can relate!  He's just a guy missing his home and singin' the blues!  A great film with great laughs througout.",1287705600,5,955,4.733333333333333
2431673,5,B000BO0L8Q,"A wonderfully campy view of Canadian, US and Alien relations. And what a wonderful premise; a born-again alcoholic fish-out-of-water alien with ""cool powers"" being chased by a motley crew of dysfunctional snipers. And nothing compares with a low budget sock puppet alien trapped in a glass cage, bashing head around swinging for a sweat escape, ""kill me ... kill me now"".

This movie starts slow, and has some uncomfortable silent moments that one must struggle through along with predictable story movement; legacies of a low budget in a time when everyone now expects blockbusters, immediate gratification, brilliant plots or breathtaking cgi. This movie has none of these modern trappings, but buried in every moment are subtleties and humor that make it watchable again and again. But beware, there is more craft in the words than there is in the plot.

If you are into cult movies, 'bad movie nights', having fun, or at least if you think a trapper replete with a bad attitude, fur hat and bad french accent is funny; this is a must-have in your collection! A jewel in the rough.",1264291200,7,1084,4.885869565217392

2431679,4,B000BO0L8Q,"Holy samolians this is one crazy, funny romp through the wildes of Canada and nightlife with the usual hi-jinx of the zany Second City comedy of Joe Flaherty!  A far out production of imagined possibilities presented by an Alien Invasion of the Great North Woods.  If you like weirdness ~ this is the film for you!",1406246400,2,314,4.589285714285714

2431682,2,B000BO0L8Q,Quirky and mildly amusing. Story is weak but worth watching as long as you are setting your expectations to low,1391990400,,111,4.6

2431684,2,B000BO0L8Q,"Strange cast - the only one I recognized was Jason Jones from the Daily Show as Agent Orange.  Strange story - shape-shifting alien who crashes in Canada, and spends a lot of time getting drunk.  Not as funny as I was hoping for.  Definitely not as funny as Paul.",1390348800,,263,4.326530612244898

2431693,3,B000BO0L8Q,"A little on the weird side but quirky enough to watch.  There was a little over-acting, ok, maybe a lot of it. But if you are bored enough you'll watch anything... right?",1363737600,,170,4.3125
2431694,3,B000BO0L8Q,you can tell it is an old movie. it had some interesting parts. the ending could have been better but still an interesting movie,1362528000,,128,4.375

Like another customer wrote, I'm not sure how I got through this movie.  Maybe I did like Phil a little but beyond that, there weren't a lot of characters I cared about.  The (alleged) plot jumps around from Phil being drunk to him preaching Jesus across Canada and the US then sex then a beaver talking then more sex then we find out the beaver is an alien too the...  See what I mean?  Trust me, you can find a better Prime movie to watch than this.  Oh and a minor having sex with a prostitute just went too far.",1499472000,,563,4.1192660550458715

I couldn't do anything about the time I spent watching this movie.  It was a waste.

If you've never seen a movie in your life, then this might be OK for you.  If you have movie-viewing experiences that would serve as contrast to this thing then you'd probably be better off avoiding it.",1454198400,,414,4.282051282051282
