8286728,4,B001CCY434,"I could relate to Billy. We watch him struggle through social akwardness, first love, and dealing with a world where he seems to be the most reasonable person in the room. His heart is so pure and his feelings are so deep. There is a sweetness and a vulnerability to Billy, and even days after watching this my mind keeps going back to Billy. I hope his life is turning out well.",1477785600,,379,4.277777777777778

8286730,5,B001CCY434,"This was a dvd I picked up at a library book sale on a whim - I had never heard of it but after reading the back I knew it would be something I enjoy and boy was I right - it blew me away, I only popped it on to make sure it played and did not skip or anything and then man I just found myself sitting there until it ended - Billy pulled me in right away from the first minute of the film and did not let me go - The kid Billy is a special kid who suffers from Asperger's syndrome is he is whip smart but loses focus - he is a riot to listen to as he talks about rock music, horror movies and just stuff he enjoys in general - He and his mom are best friends and there talks during the film made me smile - this film is about love, loving, friendship & just wanting to be happy and make your dreams - no matter how simple come true - it will make you smile, may make you cry but in the end it will make you glad that you took the time to check it out.",1413763200,,951,3.5990338164251208
8286731,5,B001CCY434,"The camera(s) are allowed to follow Billy (for awhile) because he's soooo interesting and wonderful.  Smart and innocent, kind-hearted and trusting.  So (for awhile) we get to see the world the way Billy saw it back then.  He's the kid I'd always want to stay in touch with...to see what happened later in life and have conversations with his Mom, as interesting and compassionate as I'd want a Mom to be.  I love slices-of-life stories and Billy's was both heart-rending and humorous.  I found myself smiling through most of the film because I liked the way most of the people treated Billy and found I liked the same people Billy liked.  I didn't want to not have this wonderful documentary (and Billy) with me in case I wanted to see him again or share him with someone I knew would be as impressed as I've been, so I bought the documentary and Billy and his teenage world in Maine, is sitting on my shelf, nestled among the other films or documentaries I couldn't live without.",1400544000,3,981,4.577142857142857
8286732,5,B001CCY434,"This doc follows Billy, a 15 year old guy with (at the time) undiagnosed Aspergers. Watching this  great film you really feel the awkwardness of growing up, and the pain of being different.

This is a great movie worth watching.",1305763200,,228,4.675
8286733,5,B001CCY434,"I first came across this film when I saw it linked to Ryan Gosling's name. I love his work and was disappointed at first when I slowly figured out that he isn't in it. (Only the commentary, which, by the way, was beautiful). When Amazon first listed this film for ""pre-sale"" it didn't have as much description, etc. explaining what it was. My initial disappointment quickly wore off as I began to get more and more into Billy's story. He's a strong, beautiful, poetic kid doing the best he can in a world that isn't always kind. I think everyone can probably relate in some way to Billy. He try's real hard and always wants to be on the side of good. What struck me more than anything else, was his MOM. She's like GOD incarnate or something. She's been there for him every step of the way guiding, nurturing, protecting, defending, LOVING!!! It's a powerful film that shouldn't be missed. (And, I probably would have missed it, if it hadn't been linked to Ryan's name.) It's a beautiful story about two challenging lives and the HUGE amount of love that intertwines them. If there were more mom's like Penny, we'd see a completely different world!!! Peace, LOVE, and all good things, L.",1239667200,12,1187,4.577464788732394
8286734,5,B001CCY434,"Easily one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time.  A great, quiet little film about an amazingly complex, intelligent, unique young man.  Fantastic!",1227312000,5,161,5.153846153846154
8286735,5,B001CCY434,"I happened across the trailer for this movie on the apple trailer website, and it looked really interesting.  On a whim I picked up the dvd when I saw a deal.  My wife and I watched it and I have to say that this movie is one of my favorite films.  The awkwardness of being a teenager has never been so vividly, humorously and at the same time heartbreakingly shown.  The director obviously went to a lot of trouble to show Billy honestly, but with dignity.  Billy is a special ""kid"" and I think most viewers can see a part of themselves in him.  I highly recommend this film, it is incredible!",1226534400,8,594,4.258928571428571
