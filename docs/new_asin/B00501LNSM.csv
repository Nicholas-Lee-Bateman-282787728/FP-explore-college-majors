4511215,3,B00501LNSM,"The workout had a lot of potential, however there were far too many repetitions in some of the moves. Not  only is this dangerous
but quite boring. My favourite Jari workouts are the ones which combine cardio with strength. It is more time efficient and the workouts are more enjoyable as the body and brain enjoy the variety.",1355788800,3,326,4.620689655172414

4511218,5,B00501LNSM,I am always on the lookout for DVDs that have real workouts on them. I would rather not go to the gym but I want a gym class workout. Jari's videos are the best. Can't wait for more!,1345420800,,182,3.8157894736842106
4511219,5,B00501LNSM,"Jari Love's Max DVD contains moderately paced, dumbbell exercises, coupled with controlled aerobic movements.  She works you hard by hitting both the upper body and the lower body at the same time.

Tools required are dumbbells and a step.  Don't use the step if you want to take it easy.  There are also easier moves shown for beginners who want to go light on the weights.

All three workout options warm up with the same brisk aerobic movements and cool down with the same stretches.  Each exercise is repeated for a few sets.  On all workouts, Ms. Love works with 3 women and one man.

4511220,3,B00501LNSM,"I'm a big fan of Jari Love. I've been doing her home videos for more than a year now because I had to cancel my gym membership. I really loved doing body pump at the gym and Jari's videos are the closest thing that I can get to that at home. I've loved many of her past DVDs, but this one is is not my favorite. It's dark, she doesn't let you know what exercise you are transitioning into. The camera angles make it hard to follow and I can't tell on a few of the exercises if my technique is correct. One section of the routine has terrible timing and is difficult and awkward to follow and that's reflected in the trainers not seeming to nkow what they are doing either. While it did work my legs hard, it wasn't in like a feel good, but worth it kind of way I've felt during her previous videos. In essence, the video wasn't motivating or interesting and it was difficult to follow along with the trainers. My favorites of Jari's are:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Ripped-with-Jari-Love-Slim-Lean/dp/B000FBFUEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Slim & Lean</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Ripped-with-Jari-Love-Get-Ripped-to-the-Core/dp/B000FBFUEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped to the Core</a>.",1322697600,20,1357,5.689655172413793
4511221,5,B00501LNSM,"I have extremely ripped 1000.  Sometimes I am short on time so I was really hoping this would be a good supplement.  It is.  The first workout is not nearly as challenging as the 2nd or at least so it seemed the first time I did the 2nd one.  Last time I played it, I did decide to try the 2nd since she is so good at motivating and challenging.  There is a guy she has take over part of the tracks.  He's not annoying, which is nice.  I truly enjoy her so much more than Jillian Michaels.  Personal preference, no mean to offend.  I can barely stand Jillian long enough to do the 20 minute shred video I have of hers.  I'd rather do an hour of Jari's extremely ripped.  Jari can kick my butt but still make me want to come back for more.  This video is good to have.  No cardio but you will be drenched in sweat.",1315612800,2,813,3.9751552795031055
4511222,5,B00501LNSM,"Jari's dvds are great for serious weight training and definitely get your heart rate up at the same time! This particular dvd didn't have specific ""cardio"" segments like some of her other ones do, but it definitely gives a great efficient work out and your heart rate is elevated while you're doing Jari's compound weight training intervals, i highly recomend it.
The reason for this review is simply to note that this dvd DOES in fact work in a PS3 blu ray dvd player, so don't let this stop you from ordering this dvd. Enjoy!",1312761600,4,527,4.557894736842106
4511223,5,B00501LNSM,"I have every Jari Love DVD (though I returned Lean Machine), and do them three times a week.  I like a challenging workout with some variety, but am always pressed for time.

This is my favorite Jari Love DVD.  The routines are tough, creative, and hit every muscle.  In half an hour I can get a good workout that makes me feel like my time was well spent.  It is tough, so may not be the place to start, but if you have been doing other Jari Love routines, you will not be disappointed by this one.  It as hard as any of her other DVDs, but has a little more energy and creativity than the others.",1309910400,5,598,4.068376068376068
8450566,5,B00501LNSM,wonderful lower body workout...2nd section is a kills your legs and buttocks.  You can use lighter weights if desired.,1510790400,,118,5.2105263157894735
8450567,3,B00501LNSM,"I used to do Jari's workouts almost exclusively.  I moved on to Cathe Friedrich because I wanted something different.
I went back and did this for the first time in forever.  I sweat and worked hard but this (and her other workouts) are just too dang long.  The woman refuses to pick up anything heavier than 8# so you have to do 100 reps to get a burn.  Yes you still work but the high reps get old fast.  Plus nowadays I have 3 kids so I can't workout for 80 minutes without getting interrupted 16 times!  
If Jari wants to ""evolve"" her brand she needs to incorporate much heavier weights and shorter, intense workouts.",1507939200,,621,4.3478260869565215

8450571,5,B00501LNSM,"Love this workout! It is now one of my favorites. Cannot wait to try other Jari DVDs. Highly recommend for all levels, as there are modifications offered throughout the video. You can begin using no weights, then add weights as you progress. This is the first video I have purchased that goes into detail, explaining the benefits of each exercise and exactly which muscle groups will be worked just prior to beginning of the set.",1430438400,,429,4.733333333333333

8450573,5,B00501LNSM,"I have seen amazing results with Jari Love's dvds.  I have 6, but this one is my favorite!  I'm leaner and more toned than I have ever been.  And it doesn't cost $90 a month, like my gym.  Lots of people have noticed, too.  I highly recommend this DVD and the whole Get Ripped collection.",1385164800,,288,4.163636363636364
8450574,4,B00501LNSM,"I enjoy Jari's older video collection as I have her Ripped!, Ripped! Slim & Lean, Ripped! To the Core, Ripped 1000, Ripped and Chiseled, and also her more recent Extremely Ripped!. Her older videos incorporated more isolated exercises (even with Ripped to the Core and Ripped 1000, which work multiple muscles at once, yet I felt the same type of burn as with isolated exercises), while the newer ones I own so far are more compound.

I felt a different type of burn when I do this DVD and her Extremely Ripped!, it's more of an endurance workout and my heart-rate was definitely elevated throughout. I even found I have to drop down to 3-pound weights after a while because my muscles are so worn out (I don't have to drop so low for her older vids), but that's ok because it means I have room to improve and I will not hit a plateau for some time.

This DVD is worth the money because it adds variety and new challenges to my strength training routines. My personal goal is to get a slim and toned physique and I have to say that when I incorporate her DVDs with my cardio routines, I do see visible changes in my arms/legs/abs. My diet is not the best since I am challenged everyday with lack of time and finances, so I am not able to get the amount of protein and veggies I need everyday. I feel that's slowing down my progress.

It is a life-long challenge to stay fit but with Jari's program it'll help with your muscle-toning if you stick with it.",1368057600,2,1454,4.338235294117647
8450575,5,B00501LNSM,"There are others that have left very detailed reviews already so i'm just going to put my 2 cents in about Jari's videos without getting into details about this routine.....I have quite a few of Jari's videos.  I like to rotate them because they are all kind of similar but there is some variety as far as the types of moves, how many reps, how much cardio, and the level of intensity of cardio that is incorporated.  This one is more intense, a real butt kicker. I'm glad to have added it to my collection.

Using her videos 3 times a week has seriously whipped my sorry butt into shape like nothing else i've tried. I used her videos a few years back & had awesome results. Then i fell out of shape for a while.  When i started working out again recently I spent good $ on p90x & insanity. I couldn't really get into P90x for some reason, and insanity was brutal on my joints. I didn't see the same results, so I came back to using Jari's videos. It has been about 2 months and I am seeing some fantastic results, just like before.

The only qualm i have with her videos in general is regarding her choice of music. Several of her videos have the same song that i do not much care for and it really annoys me when it is stuck in my head afterwards. So I wish she had more variety with the music or better yet an option to have no music playing. Other than that they are excellent routines & i love them.",1364515200,5,1405,4.150735294117647
