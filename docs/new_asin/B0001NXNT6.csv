8277838,4,B0001NXNT6,"ABC News presents War with Iraq is a fine oratory on the events that unfolded during Operation Enduring Freedom.  The thoughts and reflections by employees of ABC are a fascinating insight into the war and the media's integration into the military.

The negative reviews for this product are harsh and I think unjustified.  If like me you are looking for historical perspective of what went on during those months of 2003, then this title is a credible and quality title that does a fine job of informing viewers about much of the War in Iraq.",1150761600,,543,4.6947368421052635
8277839,2,B0001NXNT6,"This is a bunch of embedded reporters gee-whizzing about ""What I Did On My War Vacation"". If you are looking for combat footage from the front, as I was, you will be disappointed. Yes, there is some combat footage but mostly it's the self-absorbed reporters talking about their experiences and hardships. I gave this DVD a second star only for the segment on Fox Company which was a more genuine effort at reporting what the battle was like.",1091664000,11,441,4.666666666666667
8277840,1,B0001NXNT6,"I was under the mistaken impression that I was buying a video about the US military's campaign in Iraq.  No, what I found was that I bought a video that was more about ABC's Nightline crew and what it was like to be embedded with the US military. The video spends most of its time talking to and showing us video of the Nightline team lying around trying to catch 40 winks here and there.

They made no mention of the Thunder Runs and showed no video of these attacks made by the US ARMY's 2nd Brigade (never mind that Fox news had huge amounts of this harrowing attack conducted in early April of 2003).

So if you're a Nightline fanatic buy this video. Anyone else should spend their hard earned dollars on other videos.",1090281600,17,722,4.333333333333333
