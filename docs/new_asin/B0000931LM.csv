7988690,1,B0000931LM,"I read one review that says it gets better in season two. I couldn't make myself watch all of Episode 2. The ""posing"" is unwatchable, the script unlistenable(is that a word?), I could go on but I will not. The posing is really bad, the acting even worse. I know, it's the script and direction, but did they need a job THAT bad.",1337212800,,327,4.2063492063492065
7988691,5,B0000931LM,"I received the dvd very promptly, well within the time frame promised.  It arrived in the condition promised by the vendor.  I would not hesitate to use this vendor again in the future.",1326326400,,185,4.575757575757576
7988692,2,B0000931LM,"I wanted to buy this series of DVDs, but 11 DISKS!!!!  $17.98 a piece with 2 episodes on each!! What marketing genius did this? Is this a ploy to get more money? Quite honestly, the show isn't good enough to spend that much money!!

Don't get me wrong... I did enjoy watching the show in its weekly run. Was it the writing? NO. Was it the creative concept? NO. Was it the effects? NO. Was it the storyline? NO. Was it the fact that Victoria Pratt is (in my opinion) the hottest girl on the planet? (embarrassed) yeah... probably.

The first season is pretty cheap and uninventive. Lacks originality. Was without question a ripoff of the Xmen. The powers the main characters enjoy were pretty dull compared to Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm and Rogue.

Unfortunately, the fact that Victoria Pratt is flat out beautiful couldn't save this show, and I hope that she hangs onto a career and returns in something better. Lauren Lee Smith is actually a good actress and she deserves better too.

Bottom line though... if they had released these DVDs in a more sensible box set, I would have most likely, foolishly parted with my money. BUT $198 + S&H on all 11 disks, is far far far too much to spend on the first season of this show.  Not to mention, buying all 11 disks from Marketplace sellers + S&H would be a pain in the rear.

I'm a sucker for a pretty face, but NOT THAT MUCH OF A SUCKER...",1094169600,8,1394,4.421875
7988693,2,B0000931LM,"That this is a rip-off of X-Men is undeniably true. They even have an X in the name -- no originality whatsoever. The pilot had some good writing and sets up and intricate story that is very original unlike the idea for the show. However they try to rip-off the Matrix stuff and make it look absolutely ridiculous. Most of the consequent episodes are amazingly stupid. Cliche stories without any depth whatsoever.
HOWEVER!!! The show improves dramatically as it goes into season two and than improves EVEN MORE in season three. By season three this is an excellent show with amazing writing, stylish directing, and excellent cast even without John Shea. It is just so cool, it's amazing. Very original execution of a very unoriginal idea!
I recommend waiting for Seaons Two and Three. However, at the state the show is currently in (as I write this, early Season Three), it is so good that it makes the pilot look good, simply because it is based on it. You may want to get the pilot and maybe a few other episodes that move the story along, just to know how it all started for the consequent seasons.
I admit, second season had some stupid episodes in it (one was actually written by Freddie Prince Jr., no joke!) but overall is pretty good. Third season so far, however, is pure quality.",1076284800,3,1289,4.608695652173913

What were thinking when they created this?? All I unfortunately have to say is, thank God for books.",1071619200,,257,4.48936170212766
7988695,3,B0000931LM,"I love Mutant x. I have been a real fan from day One. I love the characters and the whole theme. I started buying these episodes but they are too much money for 2 episodes. True the commentaries are cool, but Don't expect too many extras. I expected more from the extras than I got. It would be good to have some interviews with the people behind the characters. Is that too much to ask. I recommend the show but the dvd's leave a lot to be desired.",1065052800,7,449,4.113636363636363

The transfer is presented with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, the video is full screen and naturally not enhanced for widescreen sets. Edge enhancement is also a problem and lowers the general clarity of picture. Despite this, the detail is general quite clear, grain is extremely limited, and film artefacts are rarely seen.
The colours seem well rendered, and don't suffer from any bleeding or noise. Aliasing pops up on a couple of occasions, but not to any major extent. Overall it's an acceptable, but middle of the range, transfer.",1050192000,11,1394,5.118421052631579
