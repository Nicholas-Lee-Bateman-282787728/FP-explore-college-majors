4992117,5,B006IW8DJE,"Director Kaurismki has created a story that is appealing as you watch it, but whose images and motifs will linger with you for days after you see it. His use of colour and lighting makes this visually alluring and his choices in casting have given him a pallet of wonderful faces to explore in his artistic manner. I had the impression at times of seeing a series of paintings of the Old Masters in an Art Gallery. In addition, there is a gentleness and a timelessness about this film which lifts it beyond the confines of its plot and setting. As other reviewers have stated this is not an action film as its plot is neither frenetic, nor full of the normal thrills many movie goers seek in such films. Another strength of this film is the strong acting from all members of the cast. There is a wonderful French feel about this film and many of the shots of the port city are quite lovely. I highly recommend it to those who are seeking more than simple entertainment and who would like to have a beautiful artistic experience.",1327104000,12,1028,4.444444444444445
4992118,4,B006IW8DJE,"I enjoyed this film immensely.  Director Aki Kaurismki takes his time to develop all the characters, their habits, their mannerisms, lingering on minute details such as the wrapping of a package, washing dishes, facial expressions which convey far more meaning than the dialogue itself.  The story is revealed by everything you see on screen, and it is presented like a canvas upon which to observe all that one needs to know.  Everything you see contributes to the story and the characters, and this film in rich in that regard.  This is obviously not a film that appeals to everyone.  It is not for the impatient as everything unfolds gradually and sometimes very slowly.  The approach is distinctly European and it is a study in character far more than action.  The accompanying sound track often seems odd because it is very unlike the sort of music used in American films.  Stylistically, had this film been made 40 or 50 years ago it would have looked more or less the same.  If you enjoy French films, you will likely enjoy this one and it is definitely worth seeing.",1325376000,7,1074,4.731182795698925
4992119,4,B006IW8DJE,"In 1992 Finnish director Aki Kaurismki made his first French movie, ""La Vie de Bohme"", and now almost 20 years later he returns with a second French-language movie.

""Le Havre"" (93 min.) centers around the ordinary lives of people like Marcel Marx (which character incidentally also appears in La Vie de Boheme and where he also was played by Andr Wilms). Marx tries to get by as a shoe-shiner, but life is hard. The house he and his wife Arletty have is modest at best. Then one day a group of illegal immigrants from Gabon are found in a container waiting to be shipped to London. A teenage boy manages to escape the police and eventually the boy and Marcel Marx link up. I don't want to spoil the plot any further than this, you'll just have to see how it all plays out for yourself.

This is not an ""action"" movie. Instead, it observes the ordinary lives of ordinary people, and in addition it is a love note of sorts to the city of Le Havre, which, like the characters in this movie, has seen better days but remains resilient. This movie was very well received at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, and it is easy to see why. The acting is superb throughout, none better than by lead actor Andr Wilms. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, but obviously this is not for anyone in a hurry or looking for the next Harry Potter franchise. Highly recommended!",1325116800,19,1362,4.422310756972111

4992125,5,B006IW8DJE,"This well-paced film is tasteful and poignant. Taking place within a couple of weeks, this port-town drama shows humanity at its best. Because so much of the film is shown with actions rather than words, it's also accessible to non french-speakers.

4992127,5,B006IW8DJE,"I highly recommend this movie which is in French.  A poor man whose wife is in the hospital in Le Havre, France, takes in an African illegal alien boy whose only hope is to get to London and be reunited with his relatives. At first the neighbors are hostile to the boy and his keeper, but in time they rally around them.  His wife is sensitively played by Finnish movie star Kati Outinen.  This movie is classified as a comedy, but it is light years away from being funny. It does have a happy ending but be prepared
to have your tissues handy. It's the kind of movie you can see more than once.  I bought it when I was enchanted with Kati Outinen in A Man With No Past as a Salvation Army inner-city missionary.  I went to high school with A Salvation Army girl and Kati Outinen captures the role with very realistic sweetness, warmth and modesty.
The local bar-fly characters, dour French neighbors, and the helpful cop play their roles to perfection.
The star of the movie who earns a meagre living shining shoes is played by Andre Wilms whose acting is above and beyond any expectations of a great performance.  Academy Award material.
There is some music added to this movie and the additional material on the DVD is also worth viewing.",1390694400,,1241,4.469026548672566

4992130,3,B006IW8DJE,"In the 2011 production LE HAVRE, the Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismki steps away from his usual Helsinki setting for the first in what will be a trilogy of films in Western European port cities. Always rooting for the underdogs, Kaurismki this time concentrates not just on the disenfranchised urban lower class, but on a socioeconomic strata arguably lower than them: illegal immigrants. Middle-aged shoeshiner Marcel (Andr Wilms), who lives in a run-down neighbourhood with loving wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) meets Idrissa (Blondin Miguel), a child who has found his way from Gabon to France inside a shipping container. Marcel decides to shelter the boy and see him on to England, his intended destination, but detective Monet (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) is on their heels.

In spite of the French setting, this remains a very Finnish film in its sparse dialogue and deadpan humour. Kaurismki yet again uses a very drab colour scheme and sets the film ostensibly in the present, but with cars, radios and rock music dating from the 1950s. Like nearly every film he has made, there is a musical performance by an oldies rock 'n' roll band, complete with pompadours and leather jackets. This is getting appallingly repetitive. Basically, if you've seen any two previous Kaurismki films, then you'll find almost nothing new in the aesthetic and even the plot.

That said, this is a more life-affirming film than his last, the absolutely bleak LHIKAUPINGIN VALOT of 2006. Kaurismki is clearly concerned with the plight of those who would escape sub-Saharan Africa by any means necessary, and this leads the viewer to reflection, but his expos of detention centres and police harrassment becomes heavy-handed at times.",1383868800,,1709,5.166064981949458
4992131,5,B006IW8DJE,"Le Havre was my introduction to Finnish director/screenwriter Aki Kaurismki.  After seeing the film I immediately sat down at the computer and put the rest of his films in my queue.  Called the miserabilist's miserabilist, his long sequences with no dialogue and deadpan faces are a delight to me.  His capacity to create the bleakest comedies reflects not only himself, but his mother country.  In an interview, he said in answer to what defines the Finnish character:  ""Melancholy.  And as to why Finland has such a high suicide rate? ""Lack of light. Light in every way. The sunshine.  It is always dark, and when it is dark, it is also dark in the mind.""  (Being a person affected by SAD -Seasonal Affective Disorder - I totally understand this.)  The amazing thing about Le Havre is that it is not only bleak; it is funny and sweet.  As he says (and I love this quote), ""When all the hope is gone, there is no reason for pessimism.""  The film has a quirky quality to it that brings a smile, even though it deals with life and death issues  a wife who might be dying, a young illegal immigrant from African Gabon avoiding arrest.  One of the delights is the surprise of characters who go beyond expectations.  A reminder that people have more possibilities than we often imagine.  Another delight is the astonishing affirmation of the power of a love that simply takes care of the details, one by one.",1383523200,,1404,4.604838709677419

4992136,4,B006IW8DJE,"""Aki Kaurismaki's Le Havre strikes on many different levels as being altogether a French New Wave homage (Truffaut brings to mind), a social critique about immigration, and a comedy-drama about a man trying to help a young Gabonese boy flee to London. While a film of this calibre maybe perceived as pretentious, and annoying because it is a French film with subtitles, it is however not together all that bad. More striking, being a first-time Kaurismaki and a new-found viewer of world cinema, is how the film takes its direction on a rather controversial subject by today's matters and converges it to a more apolitical fable about caring and human emotion. Le Havre is not necessarily bawdy or much in the vein of a slapstick film but moreover an intelligent piece that seems to do excellent in the department of style, cinematography, and sometimes screenwriting. It is something original and mild-mannered that, during a time full of noisy, violent, and often too opinionated films, films like this one are one in a few. While I may not understand the culture of the northern French town as well, it is always interesting to see how believable yet ironic moments can be here. Aside from all this praise, the film does suffer from timing and pacing, a striking climax, and monotony in the acting department. If this was intentional, then it can be considered passable just like a Wes Anderson film like Rushmore or Fantastic Mr. Fox. Still, Le Havre and possibly Leningrad Boys Go America are two comedies that first-time Kaurismaki, Finnish film aficionados, and world cinema lovers should not miss.""",1362873600,,1606,4.951851851851852

4992140,5,B006IW8DJE,"It takes alot these days for me to fall in love with a film but that is just what I did with the French film Le Havre (2011). The film was directed by Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki who also directed The Man Without a Past (2002). It is a story, or possibly a fable, about an immigrant African boy who becomes stranded in the French shipping port of Havre on the coast where the Seine river meets the English Channel. He was on his way to London, hiding in a cargo container, when the police opened it up and he ran away. The whole story then becomes about an eldery man, Marcel Marx, played by Andre Wilms, who, once was a Bohemian writer, possibly in Paris, now works as a shoe shiner around the train station. He befriends the boy, named Idrissa, and he, along with his neighborhood friends, make it their purpose to get this boy to London anyway they can. Meanwhile, Marcel's wife Arletty has become critically ill and is in the hospital for treatments. It is a simple yet poignant story of what can get accomplished when people work together for a common good. The highlight for me was when the neighborhood puts on a benefit concert starring a man named Little Bob who comes out of retirement to rock and roll. It is a beautiful and funny scene. The cinematography is somewhat muted and we see the pale rainbow colors of the homes and the slow and steady lifestyle of the people in neighborhood each one accepting each others talents, faults and idiosyncracies. I usually prefer films with quick and original dialogue but with Le Havre I just sat back and relaxed and wished I lived in one of the tiny homes while enjoying the little things that life has to offer.",1357776000,,1671,4.4640522875816995
4992141,4,B006IW8DJE,Le Havre is a good film for intellectuals with a slightly weak ending. The visual aspects are superb. The acting is good.,1357430400,,121,4.545454545454546
4992142,4,B006IW8DJE,"Le Havre is Kaurismaki's modern fairy-story set in Normandy. It's about an elderly shoe-shine man,Marcel Marx,living with his wife,Arletty and dog,he's devoted to her despite poverty,but they are happy and are surrounded by a supportive community. His wife becomes ill and has to go into hospital,but doesn't want him to know the serious nature of the illness. While he's on his own he comes upon a young illegal immigrant boy,Idrissa, who he lets into his house and looks after away from the Port Authorities. He goes to Calais and contacts Idrissa's granddad,who says his son was meant to be taking Idrissa to London to stay with his auntie,but his son died. He passes on a message to his grandson to obey Marcel. It's a little like Kid With A Bike strangely, people want to help the boy, people are good. There's no great drama or shoot-outs(the first scene is more a visual joke) or sex scenes. Kaurismaki is indebted to Tati(simple caf scenes,small groups of people conversing,bright colours)or Renoir or Rene Clement. We also get a very dry take off of a police inspector out of Melville.

The Kafka book of nouvelles read out to Arletty in hospital is the story,"" Children on a Country Road"",which depicts a beautiful return to a lost innocence,and the superb image-""When one joins in a song with others it is like being drawn on by a fish-hook.""That's it, the miracle of innocence and goodness in human life,the individual against the impersonality of globalisation and society's restrictions,the support of the down-trodden by the small tribes of decent folk,the smaller things that make life worth living. Andre Wilms is marvellous as Marcel,getting charity from friends,bar people and shop-keepers and organising a charity concert by Little Bob(Jean-Pierre Laud) to get the 3000 Euros he needs to get the boy on a boat to London. Of course Kaurismaki shows in 4 takes at the end a miracle: death become life, worthy of Dreyer.

4992147,5,B006IW8DJE,"In cinema, there have been filmmakers in their own countries that were known to take on the bourgeois society and the wealthy with humor but also a message.  Rainer Werener Fassbinder of Germany was one such filmmaker known for being polemic in his approach to his films.

But since Fassbinder's death in 1982, seven years later, a Finnish filmmaker named Aki Kaurismki would capture the world's attention through his film ""Leningrad Cowboys Go America"".  People saw the beginning of a filmmaker with a lot of potential and sure enough, by 2002, Kaurismki would write and direct the film ""The Man Without a Past"", as part of his Finland Trilogy (which included ""Drifting Clouds"" (1996) and ""Lights in the Dusk"" (2006), his comedy would be nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" (which he refused to attend the event because he didn't want to party in a nation in a current state of war) and would win the ""FIPRESCI Prize"" and ""the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury (special mention"" at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

Kaurismki also grew admiration for his protests, may it be against George W. Bush's foreign policy or a show of solidarity by not attending the 40th New York Film Festival because Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami was not given a US Visa in time for the festival.

In 2011, Kaurismki went to work on his second French film titled ""Le Havre"", the first since his 1992 film ""La vie de boheme"".  The film would star Andre Wilms (""Europa Europa"", ""La vie de boheme"", ""Monsieur Hire""), Kati Outinen (""The Man Without a Past"", ""The Match Factory Girl"", ""Drifting Clouds""), Jean-Pierre Darroussin (""Red Lights"", ""A Very Long Engagement"", ""Family Resemblances"") and Blondin Miguel.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Delightful, intelligent and dare I say, heartwarming film from Aki Kaurismki!

""Le Havre"" is possibly unlike other Kaurismki films, its not dark, nor is it polemic but its eccentric humor to go along with its focus on human relations is quite amazing.

In these days of worrying about the economy, worrying about surviving, the protagonist Marcel is a man who works hard as a shoeshiner to make his living and provide for him and his wife.  No complaints whatsoever.

His friends no he is fortunate to have a good wife in Arletty, but Arletty is sick and possibly not going to live that much longer.

But where most films would focus on the emotional aspect of a man losing his wife or the sadness that is typically banal in films that exploring death of a loved one or how a couple is affected, this is not that type of film.

Arletty when discussing her illness to her doctor, explains how no miracles exists to the people in her neighborhood.

Perhaps there is a growing complacency among the people of Le Havre, living the same life, day in and day out.

But for Marcel, that life is changed when he meets a young African boy named Idrissa.  We see Marcel and even his friends in the neighborhood getting a breath of new life as they try to hide and protect this young boy from being capture by police and the inspector.

And while the film is not groundbreaking, nor is it too realistic (there are many positive things that people do to help the boy, too bad society not always react with this much positivity in helping a person to such extremes), the way the film is told, the hope and caring nature of what we see visually is what captivates you.  Longtime cinematographer for Kaurismki, Timo Salminen and editor Timo Linnasalo, continues to bring beauty and natural rhythm to Kaurismki's films.

As for the performers, it's great to see talents such as Andre Wilms (reprising the role of an older Marcel, a character first featured in the 1992 film "" La vie de bohme"").  Also, great to see Kati Outinen once again in a Kaurismki films.  Despite not having a lot of scenes, Outinen's Arletty does play a pivotal role in the life of Marcel.  And also Jean-Pierre Darroussin does a great job in portraying the suspicious inspector!

And fortunately the film doesn't call for young Blondin Miguel to have an emotional scene.  That is one thing that is Hollywood banality and that is to showcase an emotional scene with a child, but for the most part, this boy is trying his darnedest to be strong for Marcel.  And for this child actor, in his first major role, Blondin does a great job of playing a boy who is alone, lonely and has to put his faith into a group of people he doesn't know.

It is a heartwarming storyline in some way, but it's about how these individuals will achieve helping him, while the police and the inspector are scouring all over Le Havre for him.  But its efficacy lies within Kaurismki's storytelling and unexpectedness.  And it is great to see something original and not so banal.  I really enjoyed this film a lot!

The Blu-ray release of ""Le Hare"" is gorgeous.  Kaurismki shows no intention of working in digital and so, the film looks natural with its warm to cool colors throughout the film.  Lossless audio is appropriate with this film utilizing a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 French soundtrack with crystal clear dialogue and good use of surround for the film's ambiance.  And there is a good amount of special features included on this Blu-ray release as well!  In fact, I was very pleased by the inclusion of these special features (and thank goodness they are long and not short), which gives viewers an idea of Aki Kaurismki's thought process of making the film but also the perspectives of both Andre Wilms and Kati Outinen who have the experience of working with him.

Overall, ""Le Havre"" is a delightful, smart, happy ending type-of-film for Aki Kaurismki.  A delightfully charming film that captures the good in people's hearts but yet done in a way that is not too cheesy or unnecessary.  It's a film with a non-preaching, positive message not about just helping people but to not get bog down with the negative things that occur in the world today.  Find acceptance and help others who need you.

""Le Havre"" is highly recommended!",1354320000,2,9019,4.830508474576271

Rating: 1.5 out of 5

 Aki Kaurismki is the extreme left-leaning Finnish director hell bent on satisfying every raving Francophile's dream. With 'Le Havre' he's outdone even the most radical of today's French libertarians by fashioning a tale of a never-say-die, radical liberal curmudgeon, out to save victimized third worlders from the clutches of a 'fascistic' police state (for Kaurismki that of course includes the Catholic church).

Our curmudgeon hero in question is Marcel, whose surname Kaurismki unsubtly dubs 'Marx'. A self-described Bohemian, Marcel used to be a bourgeoisie writer but now shines shoes for a living, obviously sharing an affinity with his working class associates (Marcel's shoe shine partner is an undocumented alien from Vietnam who carries a fake ID). Marcel is also a free-loader, often taking food from neighborhood shopkeepers on credit, with no intention of satisfying his debts. The neighbors tolerate him as Marcel's wife, Arletty (named after the legendary French actress of 'Children of Paradise' fame), appears to be a pleasant, unassuming type and soon become much more sympathetic as she falls ill (with cancer) and has to be hospitalized.

The inciting incident occurs when the police find a shipping container loaded with African immigrants at a dock in Le Havre. A young boy, Idrissa, runs away and a police officer is about to shoot him with an automatic weapon (only to be stopped by kindly police inspector Monet, who instructs the officer not to fire since he's only a child).

Wouldn't you guess but Marcel and Idrissa's paths cross and soon enough, Marcel is committed to helping the boy. He travels a long way to a detention center where he finds the boy's grandfather who informs him that Idrissa's mother is now living in London (believe it or not, 'Le Havre' is billed as a comedy and Kaurismki finds it amusing that the warden at the detention believes Marcel when he claims he's Idrissa's Albino uncle!).

The curmudgeon, now turned unstoppable hero, must find a way to hide Idrissa since the big, bad police are after him. He asks one of the neighborhood shopkeepers, to hide the boy, and she graciously complies by safeguarding him in her apartment above her shop. Another shopkeeper, initially cross with Marcel, now gives him loads of food for the beleaguered Idrissa. In contrast to what happened in World War II, average Frenchmen here are depicted as natural humanitarians who will even break the law in the name of justice. Only government officials, backed by the aforementioned bad guy police force and a reactionary clergy, stand in the way of Idrissa's liberation.

Marcel needs a ton of cash to have Idrissa transported by boat to his mother in London, so he dreams up the idea of a benefit rock concert. All he has to do is convince a local pop star to perform but first must bring the pop star and his wife back together after they've had a lover's spat (again, we're supposed to laugh when Marcel reconciles the two wounded lovebirds).

After Marcel raises the cash and brings Idrissa to the boat, Inspector Monet shows up (as he's done throughout the film) and makes it clear that he's thoroughly on Marcel's side. When the police come on board, he pulls rank and pretends that Idrissa isn't below, in the hold of the boat. One is reminded of the scene in 'Casablanca', where Inspector Renault covers for Rick who has just shot Major Strasser. Just as Monet misdirects his police officers, Renault misdirects the Germans by ordering them to ""round up the usual suspects"".

Earlier, we see Monet reassuring the Prefect inside the church that he's determined to catch the boy but it's obvious that he has no intention of keeping his word to the religious authorities (seen here as in league with the 'devil' police state). Funny how Monet so easily is determined to risk his entire career for this one boy and join forces with the disgruntled Marcel. You'll also notice that Kaurismki dare not suggest that any of the Africans that he introduces us to, are anything but upstanding, saintly citizens.

To top it off, Kaurismki cannot allow his audience to experience any of the hard knocks we might encounter during our travails in life. In the shockingly sentimental ending, Marcel's wife who has a terminal diagnosis, miraculously is cured and returns home with Marcel, presumably to put up with his never-ending curmudgeonly ways.

As a registered Democrat, I am generally sympathetic to liberal causes. However, when some of my more radical left leaning brethren decide to twist reality by proffering up fairy tales of victimization and undeserved heroes sticking up for straw men victims, I can hardly remain silent. Le Havre is watchable to see just how far its misguided director will go in peddling such a self-righteous, sentimental left wing fairy tale.",1353196800,,4877,4.970552147239264

4992151,4,B006IW8DJE,"This is another excellent offering from filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki. ""Le Havre"" from 2011, is Kaurismaki's second French-language feature, and it's a rare treat in this day and age. With an excellent cast: Andre Wilms, Kati Outinen, the great Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Elina Salo, Blondin Miguel, Evelyne Didi, etc. 'Marcel Marx' (Andre Wilms) is an ex-bohemian artist, who now makes a living as a shoe-shiner in the central-station and byways of the Atlantic port of Le Havre. When his wife 'Arletty' (Kati Outinen) falls ill, she is taken to the hospital where her diagnosis is feared for the worse. Then 'Marcel' while on his usual route and during a lunch-break, comes across 'Idrissa', a poor but intelligent runaway immigrant-boy from Africa. Who was smuggled: along with others on a cargo vessel. From this moment on 'Marcel's' life will never be the same!

This film is once again proof that there are still truly humanitarian-artists around, making profound statements about the social conditions in the world today. Mr. Kaurismaki and his fellow artists are such people! I don't want to give anything away, but this film is a perfect example of the very Christic meaning of ""do unto others, as you would have them do unto you"". Simply superb and heartwarming, done in the unique style of this marvelous auteur! Please, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. French (English subtitles), NTSC, NR 93 mins. (BTW: Please ignore the comments of the reviewers who missed the point here!)

Love and Peace,

4992156,4,B006IW8DJE,"Criterion has done another great job rescuing a little seen gem from Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki.  Set on the French coastal port of Le Havre, an aging Marcel (Andre Wilms) ekes out a living on the street as a shoe shiner.  He lives in a small apartment in a poor neighborhood with several small markets nearby.

A cargo ship unloads a container ultimately headed for London.  Authorities discover it contains 20 or so people from North Africa.  One teen age boy (Blondin Miguel) manages to get away and finds his way to Marcel while he is having his lunch.  Marcel shelters and feeds the boy even though he worries about the authorities ultimately catching him and deporting him back to Africa.  He also has to contend with his wife (Kati Outinen) who is in the hospital for what appears to be stomach cancer.  Her prognosis is grim but she hides the probable outcome from Marcel.

Using his sympathetic neighbors and an unlikely police detective (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) for support, Marcel finds out that young Idrissa was enroute to London to reunite with his mother.  He manages to get a neighbor and former headliner rock musician Little Bob to hold a fund raiser in order to pay to have the boy smuggled into England.  Kaurismaki, who also wrote the script, never plays this too serious.  But it's not a comedy either. You really have to think of it more as a fantasy.  And a good one it is.  The film ends with an unexpected surprise.  Check it out.",1345420800,6,1461,4.65234375
4992157,4,B006IW8DJE,"Back in 1938 Marcel Carne's Port of Shadows w/Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, and Michele Morgan did what could be considered the 1st waterfront film noir. This was a fantastic film about lives on the edge and the extremes that would toss about like roll of dice just for a smile, a warm embrace, enchanting engagement set for later rendezvous, and anything that resembled real love on the eve of a German disregard of all human necessities. This was a great black and white romantic film shot in the port of La Harve. I cannot and will not say more about this timeless classic here and now.

Some near 75 years later Aki Kaurismaki uses the port of Le Havre once again front and center to tell a tale of romance tripled into fairy tale of sorts as diverse characters ban together for no reason what-so-ever to rescue a black immigrant boy of near teenage youth just because. Charm, wit, cunning, deft planning, and risk of life are all combined and pushed to edge - sacrifice the all for the good of the one story. This film is a love letter to the heart of anyone whom ever cared because a rally for one is action for compassion for all. Savor a good crime haunt and lines of colored disregard to witness the better half of human nature in modern day action once again in the port of Le Harve.",1344729600,5,1289,4.393305439330544
4992158,4,B006IW8DJE,"In ""Le Havre"", the latest in a long line of deadpan character studies from Aki Kaurismaki, the Finnish director weaves a deceptively simple tale about an elderly French author named Marcel (Andre Wilms) who is taking a hiatus from writing, opting to make a less-than-modest living shining shoes in the picturesque port town of Le Havre. In a dryly amusing opening sequence, Marcel and his fellow shoe-shiner Chang (Quoc Dung Nguyen) stand by impassively at a busy metro station, wistfully tracking the parade of shoes worn by the passers-by, not unlike a dog who sits by the dinner table with infinite patience, fixing a Mesmer stare on your fork as if willing a morsel to fall its way.

Hell of a way to make a living, but it seems to suit Marcel just fine. He revels in the easygoing camaraderie amongst the inhabitants of his Utopian neighborhood, and is perfectly happy to come home to his wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) and his dog Laika (played by the director's own pooch) to drink a little wine and enjoy a simple meal. One day, as he is lunching down by a pier, he is startled by a commotion of police, who seem to be looking for somebody. Marcel spots a young boy (Blondin Miguel), half-submerged under the pier and obviously frightened out of his wits. Marcel quickly puts two and two together, but keeps a poker face until the police have left the area. He offers the boy food, and, as they say in the movies, it's the start of a beautiful friendship. The remainder of the narrative deals with Marcel's efforts to reunite the boy (a Senegalese refugee who was smuggled into Le Havre in a shipping container) with his mother, an illegal immigrant living in London. As he keeps one eye on a suspicious police inspector (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) and the other on the local snitch (Truffaut alumnus Jean-Pierre Leaud) Marcel is aided by more sympathetic fellow villagers.

Although the story is set in contemporary times, the film reminded me of Jean-Pierre Melville's  ""Army of Shadows"" . There are shared themes of loyalty, selflessness and a sense of collective idealism that feels (sadly) relegated to a bygone era. Stylistically, however, Kaurismaki and Melville are quite different. To say that Kaurismaki populates his films with quirky characters is an understatement. I'd love to know where he dug up Roberto Piazza, who plays ""Little Bob"", a ""legendary"" musician who Marcel recruits to perform a makeshift benefit concert. To look at this odd little gentleman, you'd never dream that he could rock out the way he does once he's onstage (it's like the first time you saw Andy Kaufman ""become"" Elvis). Little Bob also gets the best line in the film (""She's like the road manager for my soul."").

If you are not familiar with Kaurismaki's oeuvre, this might not be your best introduction (for that, I would direct you to his wonderful 2002 film, ""The Man Without a Past""). Jim Jarmusch absolutely worships Kaurismaki; they definitely share the same sense of humor, as well as the same sense of, er, pacing...if that helps. You're not going to see a lot of car chases, okay? And if you can settle in with this tale's unhurried rhythms, you might just catch the compassion and humanity at its core. Think of it as a shoeshine...for your soul.",1343088000,10,3251,4.789661319073084
4992159,4,B006IW8DJE,"The story of Finnish director Aki Kaurismki's latest work takes place in Le Havre, a port city in north-western France. A former Bohemian artist Marcel Marx (Andre Wilms) makes a living as a shoeshine with his Vietnamese assistance Chang (Quoc Dung Nguyen). He may not be rich, but with his loving wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) his life is not bad.

One day Marcel meets Idrissa (Blondin Miguel), a young refugee boy from Gabon running away from the police. While Marcel decides to raise money so that the boy can meet his mother in London, Arletty, ill and now in the hospital, conceals a fact that she knows would shock her husband.

The theme of ""Le Havre"" overlaps that of a 2009 French film ""Welcome,"" but Kaurismki's approach is less political, focusing the everyday life of ordinary people, described with Kaurismki's deadpan humor/sentimentality. Kaurismki's longtime photographer Timo Salminen's careful use of muted colors is another plus, adding a realistic touch to the modern-day fable.

Andr Wilms (who 20 years ago played ""Marcel,"" a down-and-out artist in Paris in Kaurismki's ""La Vie de Bohme"") turns in quiet and understated performance as the aged shoe shiner determined to do something for the boy. Kati Outinen, the director's muse since the 1980s, is also outstanding as the protagonist's ailing wife, and so is Jean-Pierre Darroussin as Monet, softer version of Inspector Javert trying to catch the boy.

I like the film for its positive, life-affirming message, though I for one prefer such films as ""The Man without a Past"" and ""Ariel,"" in which darker events happen and characters have to struggle more. Perhaps with an exception of cameo Jean-Pierre Laud, there is no ""villain"" in ""Le Havre,"" which marks a new phase in the respected director's long career.",1335916800,7,1782,5.051020408163265
