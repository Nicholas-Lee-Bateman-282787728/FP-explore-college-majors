4262380,4,B00450AGFK,"This is a film about cannibals set in Mexico and has been described as `a cannibal gore fest', which it probably isn't.

It starts out with a very weird middle aged man dieing in a shopping mall, from being poisoned. He is the patriarch of a family with a secret pact, in that they survive on the flesh of humans. The Father has `an addiction to whores' and a spooky love of shop window mannequins, so far so good.

When his family realise he is dead they suffer an emotional crisis. First he provided all the `food' and second they need a new leader. The mother is full of contempt for the eldest son, but the daughter knows he should become leader.

The police get involved when human parts are found in the stomach of the dead father and the hunt is on.

This is the tale of how the family try to pull together with internal strife and woefully inadequate attempts at doing the `shopping, and the goods they try to get. It is strangely touching and the cannibals are portrayed as very ordinary people. They do not posses the super human strength we have seen in many a representation of horror in recent times. That was much appreciated as they have to pit themselves against folk who are weaker than themselves.

This is a bloody trip with realistic gore, but not through out. It has a 15 certificate and so has pulled a few punches, but not many. It is not sexy or moody but it is atmospheric and very real, which I feel are its strong points. It has a run time of 90 minutes which does fly by and it has more twists than your average film. In Spanish (Mexican) with English subtitles, I found this a great small budget film, if your tastes are a bit off the beaten track, I am sure you will enjoy this production.",1303862400,3,1719,4.309597523219814
4262381,3,B00450AGFK,"Putting meat on the table to pull the family together takes on new meaning in light of this 1st feature by Grau. This is a satire on family dysfunction and social malaise using cannibalism as a metaphor for the cycle of violence and deprivation of social outcasts. Set in a Mexico City full of corruption,incompetence and hypocrisy. The pathologist reports having half-eaten bodies brought in all the time when a finger is found in the deceased patriarch's stomach. The family left after the father's death run a market stall repairing and selling watches. The bedgraggled mother talks about their need to carry out the `ritual' the father had devised. The husband `s addiction to prostitutes is decried by the mother when the boys bring one home. She batters her to death to gain revenge on what they did to her husband. The two sons and daughter have to choose the leader to be the breadwinner,and decide on Alfredo,the eldest gay son.

A woman singing a sad song about social injustice as she begs for money on a subway train slips Alfredo a scrap of paper bearing the cryptic message: ""You are alive"", while the mother and daughter talk mysteriously about ""the ritual"" as if their activities were somehow capable of being justified as some form of sacrament. We are not alerted at 1st to the cannibalism of the family,they just are what they are,it is a given. Consumerism is commented on in the shopping mall where a man vomits black bile,dies and his body is unceremoniously dragged away and the liquid mopped away. The family live in a weird house full of clocks,but there is a pressing need to carry on as before. The boys prey on social outcast,gays,whores and poor children. Social exclusion is more a monstrosity than cannibalism. There is a fight among minorities to survive and be noticed.

The film had murky promise, throwing up many questions but it's pacing was erratic and I found myself checking my watch at the end, feeling like we were only half way through the film. The relationships between the kids were only really hinted at and there was very little depth to them. In fact the whole film could have been fleshed out a little more (sorry).I was expecting something a little more chilling but with the emphasis on the family (who are as much victims as their meals) there are few scary moments. I was also sad to learn that the actor who played Julian, Alan Chvez, had been killed. However I hold out hope for the director as this is his 1st feature.",1353715200,,2475,4.68735632183908
4262382,5,B00450AGFK,"This movie is really dark. If you're a fan of happy or even campy films, this is not for you. This film is brutal and for some of us that's a good thing. I loved the behind the scenes stuff, if you get a chance take a look at it.",1351468800,,229,3.6
4262383,2,B00450AGFK,"What's it about?

When a family loses their father, they are confronted with a new challenge; survival. Now the eldest son must become provider of human flesh for the family ritual, a bloody rite performed too indulge this families cannibalistic tastes.

Is it any good?

`We Are What We Are' begins with the death of a middle-aged man in the street, whose body is quickly swept up by cleaners and practically treated like garbage. We are touched by the plight of a desperate widow and three teenage children dealing with grief and poverty but this sympathy is short lived when we discover this families gruesome secret; cannabalism. This is writer/director Jorge's directorial debut and although I'd heard good things I felt disappointment in a hollow script, that left me with a lot of questions; they kill and eat people in some sort of ritual, right? What is the point of this ritual? This is never explained. Just when we think we are going to get some conclusion, we hit another wall. This is noticible with the daughter Sabina, played exceptionally well by Paulina Gaitan. Her character is constrained too much, which was a shame because her motive could have been interesting. For the most part the acting is strong, the brothers are both very good and Mama is...well ravenous. Although the dark lighting is at times irritating, Grau captures the action and slums of New Mexico with some dizzying camera work. If you want some social commentary in your horror as well as distasteful characters, then check it out.

Best bit?

When Alfredo ties a prostitute to the table, Patricia beats her to death with a shovel and tells him prostitutes are not appropriate for the ritual.

Did you know?

Alan Chavez who plays Julian in the film was killed by police after Chavez and a friend exchanged gunfire at a party; he was only 18.",1338681600,,1832,4.7784810126582276
4262384,3,B00450AGFK,"I saw this film awhile ago and it was recently brought up in a conversation I was having with a friend. I recall having mixed feelings about it so I watched it again and...I still have mixed feelings about it. ""We are what we are"" is a tale of a family of Mexican cannibals whose world gets turned upside down after they suffer a death in the family. Their father, and head of household keels over and dies while hunting for fresh food(food poisoning perhaps?). The pressure in now on the family's two teenage sons to be the primary food gatherers for their sick mother and teenage sister. Most of the film follows the two young cannibals as they scrabble over who's better and they make fools out of themselves while botching their kills. It becomes apparent that neither of them have what it takes and the family is forced to take desperate measures in order to survive. It turns out that their sister has the real claws of the family and she uses her blossoming sexuality as an effective weapon. ""We Are What We Are"" is a decent horror flick. I felt that it was pretty aimless for the most part though. Too much time was spent focusing on the loser bothers running around like idiots and sniveling about their hardship. I think the film was trying to be a horror film and shocking but I found myself chuckling more than half the time. It's worth a viewing but it doesn't live up to its potential unfortunately",1334361600,,1412,4.476744186046512

Also, I give credit to the family members for a fairly good performance in portraying whatever it is that they were. However, the other acting roles had that ""hired extras acting pool"" feel to their performances.
The rest of the production crew - directing, filming, sets, etc. were OK adequate for this low budget horror endeavor.",1312156800,,630,4.633928571428571
4262389,3,B00450AGFK,"In his feature debut, Mexican writer/director Jorge Michel Grau is on the cusp of something great. The setup is solid: a family of middle-class cannibals attempts to carry on with their lives and make do in Mexico City after the untimely death of their patriarch and sole hunter. Mix in some infighting between the two teenage brothers, a teenager struggling to deal with possible homosexuality, a dash of awkward (and incestual) sexual tension, a mysterious ""ritual"" and a mother that's crazy, and it seems like there's an opportunity for this film to jump feet-first into what I like to call the ""horrorific"" genre (films more obsessed with horrific things than actual horror - think of In My Skin, Dogtooth, Martyrs, and Trouble Every Day).

After the impressive and appropriately intriguing introduction, featuring a stumbling man dying in a shopping mall only to have his body trucked away and the ground scrubbed clean moments later, the acting from the remaining family members - three siblings (Adrian Aguirre, Francisco Barreiro, and Miriam Balderas) and their mother (Carmen Beato) - is solid and impressively restrained for such an outlandish plot. There's not much downtime between establishing the characters and sending them out on a hunt for fresh flesh. Unfortunately, this is where things get a bit muddled. Grau has written in a duo of jaded, cynical policemen who make occasional appearances to remind us of the deeper messages hidden in this story - in Grau's troubled and dirty Mexico City, people are always devouring each other (metaphorically), so the police aren't impressed with a coven of cannibals that literally devour people. They choose not to investigate, opting instead to sit in their air-conditioned police cars pretending to go over files. Each time the story cuts to these police officers, the film's progress is slowed.

Meanwhile, our anti-heroes are doing the heavy lifting, seeking out new meat in the form of homeless children, prostitutes and anyone else they can lure back to their home base. Reference is repeatedly made to a ""ritual"" that must be performed in order for the family to survive, but the group is surprisingly picky about who they choose (no prostitutes or homosexuals, please!). This allows for more violence and mayhem to ensue but leaves the audience with unanswered questions, especially since the great reveal that we're prepared for never occurs.

We Are What We Are is alternately gripping and sluggish, but it never loses its edge until the coda. For a first film, it's definitely impressive, but it also leaves Grau plenty of room to grow. If he builds on this cinematic style, his next film will be something to look out for. The main thing Grau needs to remember in the future is that sometimes an axe to the head is a political statement, but sometimes it's just an axe to the head. Don't work so hard on the former when the latter works just fine.",1311724800,,2919,4.977459016393443
4262390,4,B00450AGFK,"<strong>Somos Lo Que Hay</strong> (Jorge Michel Grau, 2010)

There's a theater near me called the Capitol. It's one of the great commercial bastions of actual honest-to-pete art in Cleveland (if you want a good art film and it's not playing at the Capitol, you're going to have to wait for it to hit the Cleveland Institute of Art-funded Cinematheque or head way into the Eastern suburbs to the Cedar Lee Theatre). One of the best things about the Capitol is that, with the help of IFC and melt Bar and Grilled, they have pretty much singlehandedly revived the midnight movie tradition for movies other then the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Last night was interesting: IFC was running <em>Somos Lo Que Hay</em> while Melt was running <em>Say Anything...</em>. I like <em>Say Anything...</em> a great deal, but I've seen it many times, and I believe in Mae West's immortal quote: ""between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before."" The audience for <em>Say Anything...</em> was overflowing; the entire lobby was packed. That for the Cleveland premiere of <em>Somos Lo Que Hay</em>? Ten. I counted. Choosing the evil you've never tried before, one thinks, is becoming a lost art.

The good news: Jorge Michel Grau, who has been wowing the underground horror community with fun shorts for years now, has finally made himself a feature film. (Whether he is related to the Jorge Grau who directed such seventies cult horror standards as <em>The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue</em> I do not know.) This is good news because Grau has a fine eye for some of the subtler features of filmmaking, as well as a good sense of how to flesh out an onscreen character, and when you combine those two things, it's pretty difficult to come up with a completely bad film, no matter how micro your budget may be, as long as you get competent actors. The bad news is, Jorge Michel Grau has finally made a feature film, and that's because he didn't translate well from shorts to full-length, but more on that later.

We open with the scion of a family (<em>Amor</em>'s Humberto Y&aacute;&ntilde;ez) dying in a Mexico City mall. His body is spirited away by mall staff, a janitor is immediately on the scene to clean up the blood he's vomited on the pavement, and less than a minute later, no one knows the incident even occurred. You were looking for a black comedy? That's about as black as it gets; it's vaguely reminiscent of what Terry Gilliam might have done had <em>Brazil</em> been a gore film. We cut to a family living in a small apartment in the projects, and we are immediately given to understand, through the magic of shot juxtaposition, that he is the father of this clan: mother Patricia (<em>Before Night Falls</em>' Carmen Beato), older brother Alfredo (<em>Perpetuum Mobile</em>)'s Francisco Barriero), sister Sabina (<em>Sin Nombre</em>'s Paulina Gaitan), and younger brother... I cannot for the life of me remember his name, and IMDB is failing me. It begins with a J an d ends with an o and I'm 99% sure it is not Javiero, which is what my brain keeps telling me. In any case, the boy  is played by the late Alan Ch&aacute;vez, killed in a shootout in Mexico City shortly after the film was shot. (And since I saw this on the big screen, I can't simply go back to the DVD and check.) In any case, the family is now at loose ends as to what to find for dinner tomorrow. Which is a problem, as it turns out, because the family are cannibals. And it's not at all long before we discover why the death of their father hits so hard, aside from the obvious; the four remaining members of the clan are pretty much helpless when it comes to hunting for food. Much of the rest of the film, which takes place over the next couple of days, is focused on Alfredo's increasingly desperate attempts to feed his family. There's a subplot involving a couple of fifth-rate cops trying to figure out where the finger discovered in dad's stomach at the autopsy came from that's there pretty much for comic relief.

And what's here is good. At least one reviewer called it ""the best film [he'd] seen so far in 2010"" (at twitchfilm) and compared it to <em>Lt den R&auml;tte Komma In</em>. On the other hand, I've seen a lot of people compare it (and not favorably) to the mediocre After Dark Horrorfest entry <em>The Hamiltons</em> form a few years back, and yes, there are similarities, though I'm not sure there's enough to say there's anything more than an influence here. (That influence is, however, undeniable.)  But just because film A is influenced by film B does not make film A necessarily inferior, and such is not the case here; Grau takes that premise and loads it up with all sorts of subtle wonderment and far, far better camerawork than in that other flick. Grau's camerawork is so claustrophobic that even the father's death at the beginning--the only shot in the film outside during the day--almost chokes the viewer with its closeness. Also of note, and I wish I knew more about this guy so I could expound for a while, is a fantastic soundtrack from a chap named Enrico Chapela, who understands more about dissonance and noise than perhaps any other composer I've heard in a feature film (the arguable exception would be Graeme Revell when he's in a bad mood and reverts to the SPK days).

On the other hand there's all the stuff that's kind of hinted at but then never goes anywhere. The sexual tension within the family is ratcheted up about twenty minutes into the film, and for the rest of it you can tell there's an incestuous love triangle just bursting to find its way out of Grau's head and onto the screen, but it never shows up despite a couple of scenes that stop a knife's blade away. And while the characters are fleshed out, the plot is skinny enough that the movie does feel as if it's a touch too long. But instead of wanting the movie to be shorter, I wanted Grau to explore more about the cops, or more about the plot points that never show up, or even more about the awesome guys in the funeral home who appear for only a single scene. Grau only scratches the surface, and it's frustrating. But it's beautifully shot and well-acted, which makes it a refreshing change from the vast majority of Hollywood horror films of the recent past. *** 1/2",1307664000,2,6278,4.635220125786163
8416407,1,B00450AGFK,"This is a movie that's premise seemed a lot more interesting than the movie ended up being.  None of the characters were that likable at all, except perhaps the sister.  If you're going to have bumbling fool characters which the two brothers were, they really need to be likable, otherwise dark humour of trying to abduct kids, prostitutes and failing each time just doesn't work.  From the outset where a customer getting upset because his watch isn't ready to pickup that he dropped off for repair three weeks before, is beaten up by one of the brothers, you instantly dislike these two, who don't even take ownership of why they were evicted from the flea market place.  The mother, takes deadbeat parenting to the extreme.  Everyone else is to blame, everything they do is wrong even though they are only doing what they need to because she isn't contributing anything to planning or doing.  Really I ended up fast forwarding this thing after a while, as I just grew so bored with it.

8416414,3,B00450AGFK,"Nine Things about the Movie We Are What We Are

1. The idea for this movie is pretty interesting, but it doesnt play out quite as well as I hoped.

2. Its about a family that stays close by performing cannibalistic rituals.

3. The movie starts out with the death of the father. Then the eldest son, Alfredo, decides he must take over as head of the household. He plans on proving his worth by finding the next human to bring home to eat.

4. The bulk of movie follows the escapades of Alfredo and his brother trying to capture various people to kill. They visit homeless kids, prostitutes, and gay bars. But their quest doesnt work out quite as well as they planned.

5. There are a couple of cops that are trying to figure out who the family is, and catch them, so that they can be famous.

6. The family is so weird that its hard to really relate to anyone in the film. You watch the movie, but you don't really feel it.

7. The biggest problems in the movie are the uneven acting, and the fact that some parts don't really make sense. Characters seem to know where to go without being told, and they don't always seem to have a reason for doing things.

8. There are some pretty violent and gory scenes. It is a cannibal movie, after all. But its not as gory as you might think. It could have been much worse.

9. The moral of the story seems to be, if you are going to kill and eat someone, get it right the first time. And don't ever swallow a whole finger.",1390435200,2,1463,4.159574468085107
