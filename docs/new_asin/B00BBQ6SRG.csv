8565480,1,B00BBQ6SRG,"I just received my order in the mail from Dr. Trevor Harvey in Bronx, NY re my order for the Building a Christian Conscience DVD series.  When I put the first disc in my DVD player, it informed me that I could not play it.  My computer DVD player told me it was a CD.  I looked this up again on Amazon to get to the spot where I ordered, and it is identified as a DVD.  I don't know what my options are for a return and refund.  If this is available in a DVD format I still want it, but perhaps Amazon doesn't have it available.",1399852800,,528,3.8518518518518516
