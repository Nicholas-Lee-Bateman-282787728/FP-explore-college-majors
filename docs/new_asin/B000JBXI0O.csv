8149554,1,B000JBXI0O,Bad acting. No dancing.  Very disappointed.,1419552000,,43,6.166666666666667
8149555,5,B000JBXI0O,Nice to see talent from the Latin world break into Hollywood.  Very nice work from the director. Impeccable work from Latin singer Shalim.  He gave life to a character that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster.,1172102400,,213,4.888888888888889
8149556,5,B000JBXI0O,"I have to star by saying that the theme song to this movie is AMAZING! ""Rosario"" by Shalim is fantastic....that's the only that I could listen to for days after watching it! As a Latino, I think its important to have more movies like this one! Spin is a movie by Latinos for Latinos....actually its for everyone who loves music, especially REGGAETON! Seriously consider getting this great DVD (which includes the Rosario music video!) and watch girls, dancing, and the behind-the-scenes drama that is the music industry!

Hope this helps! :)",1171756800,,541,4.945054945054945
