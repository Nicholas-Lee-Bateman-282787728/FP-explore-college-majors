6444575,2,B00KRGYEE0,"The men in this film angered me. Especially the funeral director. He's so disillusion! But even more than him, the two investigators for not actually investigating the funeral director. WHY did nobody ever call the cops? That would have been my first move after the debt collector showed up on my door step. The music could have been much better in this film, too, some of it completely ruined the mood of the film. The actors and actresses need some more practice. The only decent one was William Manning, and he was killed off! Extremely uncool, director.",1423612800,,557,4.752577319587629
6444576,1,B00KRGYEE0,"Paranormal Captivity is absolutely one of the worst movies in existence.  I say this in all seriousness, without an ounce of irony, humor, or the usual tongue-in-cheek that I give to bad horror films.  From beginning to end, it is a bumbling catastrophe, failing in almost every possible way to convey a coherent telling of events, let alone entertain.  Far from being a successful film, the only thing that it manages to do well is move from clueless writing to insensitivity right into intensely offensive material with apparent effortlessness.  The cartoonishly evil characters and wonton brutalizing of female characters only serve to make this already sophomoric movie even less tolerable.  Just in case you have any doubts as to what I'm trying to get across in this review, let me be very clear:  Paranormal Captivity is not worth watching, not to horror movie fans, not to people who want to support indie movie makers, not to the masochists who crave riffing on hilariously bad movies.  Do not watch it.  Do not talk about it.  Don't even read the rest of this review.  Click the back button, get away from this page and don't give the movie another thought.

Unconvinced?  Of course you are.  Allons-y...

Here is a brief plot synopsis, and while I'm about to lay almost everything bare, it would be too generous to call any of it ""spoilers"".  Sarah, our ""protagonist"" (note that normally, a protagonist has to actually do something in a story.  In the case of Paranormal Captivity, I'll use it to refer to the person the camera is pointed at the most), comes home to find her husband dead of apparent suicide by asphyxiation.  In a running car.  On their driveway.  Unlike normal people who might be preoccupied with questions like, ""Why?"", ""....the driveway?  Seriously?"", or ""Wouldn't someone, in a neighborhood full of people, have done something?"", Sarah simply goes on with her life.  Unfortunately, that life is one of foreclosure, bankruptcy, and crushing credit card debt, thanks to her late husband.  With nowhere else to go, she manages to stay with her only living relative, her great-uncle Steve, in a very normal looking ""creepy old house"".

 By way of her husband's funeral, Sarah is forced to meet the first of our two unrealistically evil villains, the Funeral Director.  Briefly accompanied by a nameless woman wearing almost nothing (who leaves the movie with, ""I'm outta here!"", then walks straight into a bathroom), he is monotone and boring, though somehow interested in our pluckless protagonist.  For a while, he does absolutely nothing but be a creeper.  So far, every shot, piece of dialog and second of editing is horrible, seemingly written by an alien anthropologist who is making a movie as a project in their ""Introduction to Human Entertainment"" class.  Wonderful!

As the story continues, Sarah hears strange noises throughout the house and notices her things moving.  She presumes it's just her great-uncle being senile and perverted (she laughs at the idea of her uncle peeping on her.  I did not), until she walks upon a plainly visible ghost, a little girl who seems just as surprised to see Sarah, and they both run away in fear.  Again, completely unburdened by the sorts of thoughts a normal human being might have (""I just saw an actual ghost!""), she mostly carries on as though the sighting never happened, only later calling a psychic.

Another awkward cut brings us to an unnamed, unmarked, and otherwise unidentified office building to introduce the second villain.  Up until now, the movie has been mostly hilarious, and had it continued to be just silly, low-budget and corny, I would have enthusiastically recommended it.  However, this character marks the point where the movie crossed over from the land of the cluelessly insensitive to full-on violence against women.  The office is that of a collections agency, and the newly introduced villain is a very angry debt collector who seems to have taken up misogyny as a way of life.  He generally refers to women as ""that b*tch"" and will savagely murder three female characters in the course of the film, one of whom in a scene with no other purpose than to show the brutalization of a stripper.  It is around this time that we also learn that the funeral director is a psychotic pedophile who murdered his own child after sexually abusing her, and then his wife (I think) after she came close to discovering his secret.

This is the bulk of what the movie has to offer.  [Erroneous plot plot redacted]  Later, we learn that it was the debt collector who killed Sarah's husband, but other than these rather lame revelations, there is nothing but filler.  At this point, you might be wondering how these two can live so effectively as murderers without being caught.  You stop wondering when you meet the only two police officers in the movie, Detectives Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle The-Writer-Knows-Nothing-About-Police-Procedure, who seem reluctant to investigate anything at all, but love to make wild accusations.  All of this would be hilarious if it weren't for the violence perpetrated on female characters, who are written to be stupid, helpless and victimized.  Only three men in the whole movie aren't portrayed as harming women, and two of them die.  Except for Sarah's friend, who pays for her strength of character, the women in the movie are as stupid as the men are atrocious.

To summarize, the writer(s) of Paranormal Captivity felt entitled to use pedophilia and violence against women as plot points in a poorly made horror movie that features gendered slurs more often than the word `ghost'.  It shows bruises on a woman about as many times as it shows a spirit.  Its flat, bland villains are merely exploited images of very serious real-world violence that takes up more time than the hauntings.  This isn't just bad, it's shameful and idiotic.  Don't watch this movie, because even if you're just looking for a laugh, you'd be laughing at the expense of real women and children who have to deal with this violence.",1422316800,14,6041,4.914116485686081

So why did I spend an hour with this one, you may ask? Because I feel you need to watch a full mov... ahhhh never mind, I can't even think straight after viewing this...

6444579,2,B00KRGYEE0,"I got a good amount of unintentional laughs from the movie, so I can't say I hated it. Our lead character, Sara, has moved in with her senile uncle after her husband committed suicide. He killed himself right after the opening credit scene of a cutesy ""let's go shopping!"" mall montage, so can you blame him? But Sara doesn't just have to contend with lame ghosts in her uncle's house, but also a creepy, ultra-perverted funeral director and a psychotic, woman-abusing, cat-hating debt collector, both of whom are stalking her. In other words, hilarity ensues in this micro-budget horror stinker. And prepare yourself for an unending stream of bad music accompanying many scenes, most of it reminiscent of a daytime soap opera recorded on a Casio. At one point one of the actors bumps the camera looking over his shoulder with an audible thump. No time for a second take! This is one of those ""so bad it's almost good"" movies, so if that's not your thing, steer clear of this mess.",1421193600,5,981,4.709302325581396

WHO FAINTS WHEN THEY HEAR THEIR NAME ON AN ANSWERING MACHINE, huh? i almost turned the movie off when that particular scene happened. But i gave the whole movie a chance.

6444591,1,B00KRGYEE0,"--------------------------Spoiler Alert, Be Warned This Is A Review/Spoiler Ahead-----------------------

Animal lovers beware because this'll rile ya like it did me big time. My problems and issues with this movie, lets begin

1 Sarah a girl deeply in debt consolidates her bills goes to live with her kind elderly uncle Steven. Homicidal psychopath bill collector guy comes to hassle her demanding $8000 up front gets physical her friend slugs him, he swears revenge. Later Sarah goes out he breaks in kills her friend. A while after that he goes back again picks the lock steals money and get ready for this MICROWAVES her cat to death, Ahhhhhhh OMG

2 Wacko debt collection company dude has a stunning blond girlfriend Samantha who he's been beating and who is also in a debt consolidation agreement. His co worker a nice guy who happens to be in love with her not knowing what will happen puts her case file on his desk. Psycho looks throws a 2 second tantrum goes home with Asian food refills her wine glass puts poison in it while the poor girls dying he rants about her debt how she I guess he thinks did not pay enough, he shoves a rose in the gasping for air woman's mouth clamps his hand over it till she's gone. He tells others she committed suicide but the cops know better

3 Sarah is so distraught over the loss of her cat and friends death accidentally overdoses on pain killers in the hospital room unconscious after being saved. Demented debt collector dude you guessed it ta da shows up gee how surprising, not, however his plans are thwarted when he arrives there's a guy there the undertaker posing as Sarah's uncle then the doctor comes in so after yapping he leaves. Later on yawn nut job comes back again snaps the gold chain off Sarah's neck says you better pay up ????? then with a stamper stamps past due on her forehead and leaves

4 Next he goes to a strip joint his next victim an in debt stripper bartender she takes him to the back room offers him a little take it out on trade deal, he beats and chokes her. While on the floor he reaches in her bra top and takes her money and leaves clipboard in hand

5 Homicidal maniac number 2 yup cuz ya know ones never enough the town undertaker who's committed a few of his on murders over the years, he has an obsession with Sarah. He breaks into Sarah's house with a needle injects something into her uncle Steven's neck calls his assistant saying Steven died pick up then cremate the body. Sarah is injected with something and tied to the bed. Now killer number 1 has arrived debt collector armed with a knife tells Sarah pay up and I'll let you go, he tells her that her husband didn't kill himself with car carbon monoxide but it was he himself who set it up to kill him. Her dead husband does get even so that's a plus

6 The female cop character oh my god she is nothing but an arrogant accusing mean irritating pain in the ??? who only seems more interested in bullying than facts and catching actual guilty parties. When Sarah's friend got murdered she accused Sarah of doing it though Sarah was across town. Then when Sarah told her about the undertaker also being there the cop says she's so drugged up she hallucinated

How it ends

Sarah is telling a woman how the undertaker fixed it so and told the cops that Sarah had called set up the funeral with him and he got the paper signed by the doctor and created a great fake alibi. After visiting the cemetery Sarah goes home while laying on her bed reading she screams when she sees someone Undertaker who shoves a needle in her neck killing her with an injection. This garbage shouldn't even be categorized as a horror paranormal movie it is more of a serial killer movie than a paranormal investigation story

I gotta give props my favs and actors

Debt collector- The dude who played the psycho debt collector I love that actor man he looked the part perfectly and played the hell out of it his facial expressions everything very scary. Uncle Steven- This guy is a sweetheart lovable character. Sarah- This actress is awesome. Police woman- Okay anybody that can make you that annoyed with their character well damn she is amazing great job. I say this though I hate the film the actors are truly excellent",1434153600,4,4244,4.491569390402075
6444592,1,B00KRGYEE0,"I enjoy watching any horror movies..even bad ones. I admire a very low budget film made by a group of friends. For Paranormal Captivity is does everything wrong.

Lets start with the normal thing associated with a bad movie...

Acting, filming, makeup, and sound. These issues are expected for indie self made film. The straight white camera light always being used really distract from any scene. I don't know why these didn't turn if off as the natural lighting would have been fine...but in almost any dimly lit scenes..there's the camera light...putting hot spots on the actors...The acting is just bad...Likely everyone involved have little experience and that's ok..again everyone has to start out somewhere. It seems they tried. Sound d needs to be equalized....there are a few parts where character are discussing plot points and its hard to hear. Make up is bad but really nothing horrible...it works well enough.

Now the core problem with the movie is the story and pacing. This movie is an hour and 40 minutes..and it feels like 3 hours. The movie could have been easily cut down to 45 minutes to an hour. The movie takes way to long showing how evil the two bad guys are...we get it..their evil...their bad...wow..I really hate them...get on the next scene..oh..now the evil guy number 2 is attacking another girl....ok...oh now hes burning down an orphanage and jaywalking. WE GET IT! Another problem with bad guy number two is his motive just doesn't work. Bad guy number one you'll sorta have an understanding for his motive and can believe it. Bad number two is flat out stupid. There is no way given how unstable he is that he would last and not be caught. The entire set up...that's I think was suppose to surprise the viewer is obvious and completely laughable.

My friend and I enjoy watching bad horror movies..but this was the first one in a while that made us angry. It didn't make sense..it  was terribly written...and it was way to long.

If your looking for a movie to test your patience I would say watch this movie..the first 45 minutes are what you would expect from a one star movie..however the terrible pacing..bad character development and length of the movie will wear you down..by an hour and 10 minutes..you'll be  annoyed..and it only gets worse.",1433721600,,2284,4.811224489795919

6444594,3,B00KRGYEE0,"DIY filmmaking at its best! Once I got past how astonishingly amateurish it is (in an early scene, there's a blurred-out license plate on a moving car!) I actually got caught up in this homemade video shocker. The acting is worse in the younger and older characters, with the more middle aged (30s-40s) performers seeming the least terrible. The plot involves multiple ghosts and multiple serial killers, semi-attractive young women with large boobs, a funeral home, a gentlemen's club, and more amateur filmmaking mistakes than you can shake a stick at. But you know what? I saw this and the medium-budget Oculus on the same day, and I wouldn't say either movie was better or worse than the other one as a viewing experience.

What pisses me off about badly done horror films like this is the fact that so many genuinely talented people never get this chance to have their work seen. Instead of having someone not connected with the film read the finished script for plot holes (the stripper) and things that don't work (most of the film), they just wrote ""THE END"" at the bottom of the last page and started the cameras.

6444603,5,B00KRGYEE0,"***Minor Spoilers***

John Orrichio's ""Paranormal Captivity"" tells the story of Sarah. She loses her husband, her home and most of her money. That forces her to move in with her creepy old Uncle. A psychotic debt collector is after her and she's being stalked. Is it by ghosts or a crazy funeral director?

There are three story lines in Paranormal Captivity that are all related to the unfortunate Sarah (Caitlyn Fletcher). Sarah and Thomas the debt collector (Roberto Lombardi), Sarah and the funeral director (Edward X. Young) and Sarah and the ghosts. These three lead actors do a great job in their respective roles.

The three stories seem unrelated, but intersect at the end of the film where there is a big plot twist and reveal! The writing is very well thought out and leads the viewer in one direction only to take a left turn at the end! Interesting, moody camera work too. Great stuff!

Other notable performances are Jason Vail as Gary, Suzi Lorraine as Samantha, Linnea Sage as Kelly and Jerry Ross as William. Each of these supporting characters drive the story along and add to the lead characters.

If you have a short attention span you won't like or understand this movie (as is evident by some of the other reviews) and you should probably go back to torture porn horror where the images change every two seconds. The ghost effects are done really well and the makeup and blood effects are all practical. No CGI!

Highly recommended!",1424131200,,1454,4.75
6444604,1,B00KRGYEE0,"Ummmmmmm, yeah.  I thought this was a ""restless spirit"" movie.  This was garbage!  Acting sucked; storyline . . . . . was there one?  Ummm no!

8661023,1,B00KRGYEE0,"Well, at least it was free to watch with Prime! The only positive thing that can be said about this ""movie"", is that it IS forgettable. The story is lame, the writing is a joke, the acting is laughable, and the overall production just plain sucked. Sorry, but it did. Of course, there are a few positive reviews (two as of writing this) so at least two people liked it well enough, (Chuck, liked it, but he didn't offer much. And Debbie D. also seemed to like it, but she just tries to belittle those who disagree, and doesn't really offer anything either. In fact, Chuck's review is better simply because it doesn't come off as a bad trailer!) but hey, opinions vary.

And my opinion is that this movie is just terrible. At the very least I would say it's a pathetic attempt at movie making. Conversely, at best, it's almost the same thing. To me, that really says something, because I normally enjoy crappy movies. It's just not everyday that I see one that make many B, C or even D quality movie seem Oscar worthy.

Between the stiff (ok, horrible) acting of all involved, the shoddy writing, etc, it was a long hour and 48 minutes. It almost felt like a day had passed while waiting for something decent, or interesting to happen. Something did finally happen that made it all better though. It was the exact moment when the credits started to roll; which was hands down the absolute best part of this entire thing. I'll bet on the fact that it's at least partly because they're just not actors. Apparently those who wrote it, aren't actually writers, either. I mean, sure, they tried, but that doesn't mean much based on what I just watched. Actually, the same can be said all around for this thing! Even for a novice this is bad.

Of course, the overwhelming amount of negative reviews will state the obvious, but we all know there are those few who will try shooting it down. They'll try to dismiss this, and that's fine, but let's be real; if it were any good, there'd be a lot more than 2 positive to the 34 (35 counting this) negative reviews, wouldn't there?

I left out any spoilers, because in order to add them, I would have to recall various scenes and plot points. And as I stated earlier, it's a forgettable movie, and I can't think of any reason to want to talk about it. Well, other than to warn anyone thinking that they'd enjoy this. I say this often, but with good reason; don't take my word for it. Check out the other reviews (some do add spoilers) and see how they differ. If that's not enough, well, feel free to waste an hour and 48 minutes of your life.

If the story of a crazy, murderous funeral director, a psychotic, woman beating ""douchey"" debt collector who is also a murderer, and crappy ghost stories; along with horrible acting, writing and production values are your thing, you'll probably get into this. However, based on the other reviews, and what I just watched, I would definitely doubt it.",1482364800,,2933,4.48501872659176

Do you like things that have to do with the word ""Paranormal?""  Go watch another, preferably better, movie.  I'm not saying that a horror movie can't be done on this film's shoestring budget.  I'm not saying you need to even SEE the ghosts to have a good paranormal movie.  I am saying that in order to use the word ""paranormal,"" your haunts should probably take more than a second billing to the over the top bill collector or mortician.",1450656000,,739,4.557251908396947
8661027,1,B00KRGYEE0,"This movie was very poorly written. No dialogue felt natural and the situations were just so unrealistic that it broke my suspension of disbelief. Cops/detectives don't seem too worried about solving a case or two but instead like to throw out random accusations through the means of bullying. In fact, at one point one suspect points out that the victim's partner Thomas caused the victim harm in the past, followed by the detective asking who the hell Thomas is. I don't know; the boyfriend of the victim who's case you're solving? Have you done any research at all?

Apparently the main character has money issues. Does she even have a job? I don't see her do much to get out of trouble. Maybe she should've sold her late husband's $50,000 BMW, or at least get rid of her $40,000+ Toyota SUV. That should help a little with the money issues, I would think.

And then we have the goofy debt collector antagonist, who resembles a lovechild between David Ramsey and Jack the Ripper. Apparently people in debt (to actual credit companies such as Visa and Mastercard, both companies who don't issue credit themselves) royally piss him off to a point that he'd rather just kill them. I agree that people living above their means is aggravating, but to go and kill people for it? Though with the way the police department is portrayed I don't blame him for breaking the law, I guess. Committing crimes and getting away with it has never been so easy.

And who's idea was it to kill the cat? Seriously? Killing animals does not add shock value. It's just stupid. I remove stars automatically for killing animals in movies. Personal pet peeve, I know, but oh well.

Oh, and it wasn't scary at all. That's in case you're a horror fan looking for a good indie scare. Keep looking. There's no thrilling aspects here. Just a bunch of people dying because they owe anywhere from $5000 to $10,000 in credit debt. David Ramsey is coming to remove debt from the US; one death at a time.",1448582400,,1972,4.60968660968661
