It's more of an anime about beating up street gangs who just happen to ride roller blades with electric motors in them. I used to ride roller blades in middle school but I never associated it with being tough. These guys and girls really stick it to each other.

The main character, Ikki, lives with a family of sisters. He is a delinquent in a street gang. One day he finds a pair of ""At's"" in one of his housemates rooms. The story is about him climbing to the top of the AT battle world with his friends.

This series has a lot to offer. It has action, comedy, drama, and a bit of romance. Not as much as Ikki would like though. The animation is good and so is the soundtrack. It has a different kind vibe to it. It's very pop culture oriented and there is a descent amount of fan service. My only complaint with this one is that the whole roller blade thing is kind of lame. It's a bit of a strange premise to base an anime on. Even though the series is pretty entertaining, I wouldn't call it extremely memorable. There are many more animes out that are way better. If you've seen everything else go ahead and watch Air Gear, but check it out on Netflix or Youtube before you drop $20 on it.",1354665600,3,1363,4.120300751879699
