8179420,4,B000NO1ZKM,"I just ordered a 7 dvd set from the Watch me learn website, they have a 50% off sale for school, not sure if it's a limited time offer sort of thing. It is just under 80 dollars with free shipping for 7 dvds. You could also get 5 dvds for just under 70 with, I assume, free shipping. The psychologist recommended these modeling videos when my son was evaluated and diagnosed with Autism, he is almost 6 yrs. old now. He just started kindergarten and is having a lot of trouble adjusting. I couldn't imagine paying 30 bucks per dvd, so I checked craigslist, and found the website charging 15 per dvd, but with major discounts for buying sets. I will update my reviews once I receive and use them. Save money look around! :)",1441929600,,722,4.3161764705882355
8179421,4,B000NO1ZKM,"For the price this is fairly low budget.  What's also hard is that the adults who play the teacher, the gym teacher and the speech therapist have the strongest New York accents I have ever heard....very distracting!!  Overall it is a good idea that is definitely needed.  I got it for my 3 year old who has some delays and is having trouble with preschool routines.  It is really suited for a child a bit older....5-7 might be optimal.  The dvd shows various scenes throughout an elementary school day...riding the bus, opening activities, gym class, a speech lesson, lunch, play ground, centers and an art class.  There are times when it gets a bit dull (art class...how many minutes can you watch kids glue petals onto a piece of paper?) , but for kids who need visual reminders about how to carry on during the school day, it is helpful.  My son also loves the dvd's ""Buckle Up"" song.",1394150400,2,887,4.540880503144654
8179422,4,B000NO1ZKM,"I was a little hesitant to spend the money on this and when I first watched it with my son who is high functioning autistic I thought I had wasted my money.  However, he was very interested in it and it seemed to give him some confidence in going to school.  He has issues with acting out inappropriately at school and this movie did help him anchor on some positive peer models of how to behave at school.  I think it may have been helpful for the producers to put in a few more scenes ware kids are acting out a bit and get control after the teacher gently corrects them.  All and all I think it was money well spent.",1376524800,2,619,4.090909090909091
8179423,5,B000NO1ZKM,I ordered almost all of these series for my 3-year-old nephew who was diagnosed on the autism spectrum. His mom says that he will just sit and watch them and that they have been really good in helping him with social skills and verbalizing.,1376265600,2,240,4.4772727272727275
8179424,5,B000NO1ZKM,"I bought ""School Days"", ""Friends"", and ""A New Beginning"" for my three year old daughter. These videos have helped my daughter be much more social. The improvement in her just blows me away! It's great for children with, or without autism.
A little expensive, but worth every penny.",1345507200,4,281,4.875
