895850,1,6304528922,This was not a good horror movie. This movie really sucked! There was no gore in this movie. This was the sorriest movie I ever seen!,1255910400,,133,4.153846153846154
895851,1,6304528922,"I hate slow moving films.  This movie was on for an hour and had VERY little action at that point.  The surgical equiptment wasn't realistic, the acting was pretty bad, and the plot was stupid.  For instance,  a woman in a leg cast is having sex in her hospital bed with about 50 lit candles all over the room.  I MEAN COME ON, since when does hospital policy allow that?!  If you've ever stayed overnight in a hospital you'd know they check you periodically through the night.  Skip this one, unless you need something to get you to sleep.",1204848000,,540,4.393939393939394
895852,3,6304528922,"From a director you've never heard of comes a totally derivative horror film starring a cast of mostly unknowns with a few prominent faces tossed out in cameos. Yep, it's time to review Carl Schenkel's (who?) 1995 film ""The Surgeon."" O.K., maybe I'm being a bit too harsh here. Schenkel apparently lensed the Christopher Lambert vehicle ""Night Moves"" and the early Denzel Washington picture ""The Mighty Quinn,"" so he's not completely obscure. But, in the words of Janet Jackson, ""What have you done for me lately?"" The answer must inevitably be ""not much"" if ""The Surgeon"" is any indication. One great thing about exploring the highways and byways of the horror genre is the constant discovery of movies I have never heard about before. I spend a lot of time trying to follow the ins and outs of horror movies and I STILL come across stuff almost every day that has me scratching my head in bewilderment. Then it's time to track down copies to watch, a task made infinitely easier thanks to the advent of DVD. Before digital video discs arrived on the scene, scoping out the horror field was time consuming, expensive, and frustrating. Not anymore--even the most obscure stuff is available for rental as companies try to provide enough product for a hungry market.

Problem is, watching ""The Surgeon"" is likely to give the viewer a case of indigestion. Set in a hospital (duh), the movie introduces us to Dr. Theresa McCann (Isabel Glasser), Dr. Stein (Malcolm McDowell), Dr. Benjamin Hendricks (James Remar), Dr. Julian Matar (Sean Haberle), Dr. Ed Mittlesbay (Charles Dance), and a police lieutenant named McEllwaine (Peter Boyle). Who are all these people and what interest could they possibly hold for the dedicated horror viewer? Sorry, I haven't an answer to the last part of that question. I can tell you that Dr. Stein is an egomaniacal researcher working on some crackpot theory that would make kidney dialysis obsolete. Impressive, eh? Well, it is until a monkey he experiments on in front of a lecture hall full of physicians goes bonkers. The concerned McCann, obviously the heroine of this movie, confronts Stein about his questionable ethics and begins to interfere with his patients. One of these unfortunate wretches dies horribly, and McCann takes the rap when hospital administrator Mittlesbay steps into the picture. Now suspended from her duties as healer of the sick, McCann falls in with the brilliant but egotistical intern Hendricks to find out why Stein's abhorrent practices go unchecked.

The two return to the hospital in time to witness Stein's demise at the hands of Dr. Julian Matar, a crazed lunatic exiled from the hospital some time before for attempting to perform regeneration experiments on patients. Matar takes a whack at McCann at this point too, but the police show up and cart the loony off to jail. Whew! Nope, not yet. Matar escapes and returns to the hospital in order to dispatch McCann's patients with extreme prejudice. He's not doing it to be mean per se, but because he wants to collect their pituitary extract so he can keep his experiment running, an experiment that we soon discover comes straight out of some shady stuff going on in National Socialist Germany during World War II. I wonder if insurance covers the procedure? Anyway, the cops reenter the picture and work with McCann and Hendricks to capture the perverse Matar. Good luck! This guy is one clever customer who always stays one step ahead of the authorities. Too, whenever he gets hurt he just injects himself with some of his serum and rapidly returns to fighting speed. In the process of tormenting McCann and extracting his pituitary fluids, Matar finds time to torture a few people to death in extraordinarily nasty ways. Mittlesbay's demise alone is worth watching, but a few other people bite the bullet before the film grinds to a halt.

""The Surgeon"" does have a few things going for it, namely some effective gore sequences involving a needle plunged through an eye, a mouth stitched shut, and a body hit with so many bullets that it makes the Sonny Corleone assassination in ""The Godfather"" look like a hangnail in comparison. A few of the performances aren't that bad--primarily those from McDowell, Boyle, and Remar--but only Remar hangs around long enough to elevate the film. Isabel Glasser is a pretty lady yet an odd choice to play the lead role. And the guy they found to fill the Matar role obviously went to the William Shatner School of Overacting. The biggest problems in ""The Surgeon"" are its lack of originality and its inability to stick with one theme. A mad scientist type going around using gland extract to make a regenerative drug? I must say that is hardly groundbreaking plot material for a medical thriller. Too, the movie veers wildly from mystery to romance to thriller to horror. Why so many divergent elements in a film clearly marketed as a straight horror flick? Pick a theme and run with it, already!

The DVD contains no extras, not even a trailer or an explanation from Boyle and McDowell describing why they took roles in the film. If you've ever spent time watching movies like ""Coma,"" ""Visiting Hours,"" and ""Dr. Giggles,"" you'll probably want to spend an hour and a half with ""The Surgeon."" You know, on further reflection I think I will give the movie a solid three stars. It does throw around a lot of the red stuff, boasts a few prominent faces in cameo roles, and Glasser is quite attractive. The movie's lack of an original plot and failure to decide what it wants to be does hurt the effectiveness of the whole thing, however.",1113004800,2,5594,4.84221525600836
895853,2,6304528922,"This Canadian horror film from director Carl Schenkel uses elements of the Frankenstein story, even featuring a Dr Stein, with experimental procedures that remain unapproved because of their side effects and a pioneering doctor who has ""genius beneath the madness"". We also get a touch of The Phantom of the Opera with the doctor now haunting the morgue of the hospital he had practiced at, and of course continuing his work. Schenkel has some skill in creating suspense, also injecting some comic shocks, but by the time we are chasing the killer in the unused basement of the hospital (why do horror movie hospitals always have unused basements?) the mad/genius doctor's efforts to rejuvinate himself alas does not help to rejuvinate the audience. I am not educated enough to know how scientifically valid the doctor's theories are (that pituitary extract culture can be used for muscle fibre and bone regeneration), though I am morally aware enough to question his rationale of using terminal patients in the same way the Nazi's used death camp inmates. Schenkel opens with a lightning benefited Whatever Happened to Baby Jane black an white camp sequence, which introduces his taste for gore and sadism, and the camera's style of overview prefigures the killer's fondness for jumping onto his victims. But it also sets up false expectations - the use of a lollipop becomes a red herring, though perhaps this in itself allows us to accept Schenkel abandoning the plot of another doctor's experimental procedures, with a baboon, no less. The only time the opening campy tone is repeated is in the over-the-top touches of the performance of Sean Haberle as the doctor. The superhuman qualities of the cliched serial killer/slasher are reinforced by Haberle's use of the stolen pituitary gland extract, yet his continual need for rejuvination because of sustained injuries is a running gag, and his look to the camera at one point is hard to read. Otherwise we get the standard heavy-breathing on the soundtrack and schlock music score. There is a restaurant sequence with a walltank of upstaging whales, a grotesque sewing up of the mouth of an actor using an alien accent, a full frontal nude shot of James Remar in a pool, and a nifty strategy for overcoming the obstacle for finger print security. We also get a laugh line in a police interview with ""You'll have to speak up. The tape doesn't record gestures"". As the heroine, one's assessment of the performance of Isabel Glasser may be influenced by how one views doctors. Are they ordinary people who can act like clutzes or gifted heroes with a right to be arrogant?  Glasser's big moment comes with a memory speech where her mascara tears ruin her perfect glazed makeup, but her deliverance remains stoic, as if the tears do not belong to her. Perhaps she obtains our empathy because the only other character with equal screen time is the killer, though she looks awfully silly when she runs, and I don't think I'd choose her as a consultant.",989107200,,3001,4.9191321499013805

7873733,3,6304528922,"This film isn't spectacular or anything like that, but it can be a fun film if you like these types of horror flicks that deal with mad doctors or that mostly revolve around hospitals. It deals with a mad surgeon who has created a formula that allows him to escape death. Most of the scenery is nothing special, and the it also lacks effective atmosphere. There's some bloody scenes, and there's a part when a large needle is inserted into a nostril that may not be for squeamish people. However, this isn't a non-stop slasher gore movie. It's isn't a film where a psycho simply slaughters one person after the other in a hospital, and the killer is shown and doesn't conceal himself and kill like in a FRIDAY THE 13TH flick or similar slasher. You get a decent amount of violence, some gore and some action, along with some character development and dialogue for the story. Isabel Glasser shows some full nudity in a swimming pool scene that also contains some full male nudity, and there's another topless scene in the movie with another woman.  The movie is decently scored and directed, and it moves at a decent pace. The entire film does have a somewhat direct to DVD or made for cable type feel to it. It would've been better if they skipped on some of the dialogue and just added some more nudity and gore because that's the main reason why I bought a film like this, but it does have its moments.

My DVD says ""Gold Series"" on the top of the case. The quality is very good, but the menu screens and chapter stops are plain without any animation. There are no interviews or commentaries.",1387843200,,1594,4.493103448275862

7873735,3,6304528922,"When it comes to the 90's, there is nothing better then what the decade had to offer in the horror department. Sure the films weren't anything special by conventional means but were certainly something fantastic for the B aficionados. After many many years of viewing what most deem ""unwatchable,"" we've remained dedicated to the task of cramming in as much B as possible. Even if some stumpy little trolls can't help but throw their useless two cents in on our reviews....we won't stop. We're dedicated professionals that forge ahead no matter what basement dwelling virgins feel the need to come at us. Keep up the comments #1 camps because we love it. In fact it pumps the brothers Sid up for more reviews.

So outside of the friendless troll tirade we must halt and get to our feature film of the evening. This 90's entry is a little lesser know horror called The Surgeon. The movie opens up many years ago as a kid watched his brother accidentally get killed on the operating table at the local doctors office. This naturally leads him to live a deranged life dedicated to experimental surgical procedures. After getting his license revoked he surfaces two years later for revenge. No patient is safe from his crazy experimental madness. Unfortunately there wasn't enough action going on to keep this one above average.

We truly wanted to love The Surgeon but just couldn't find the goodness we were hoping for. With the storyline it dished out we couldn't believe how little it delivered. Now there were a few choice comical moments spread throughout to keep our interest going, but nothing like we had hoped for. It wasn't horrible but wasn't anything noteworthy like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dentist/dp/630512003X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dentist</a>&nbsp;which we're were hoping for. It would have been a different story if Corbin Bernsen had starred in The Surgeon as well. Despite the possibility of some negative feedback from the troll-like, basement dwelling virgin, we will continue to educate the world on the vast variety of B gold circulating. We really know how to explore the studio space.",1301961600,,2170,5.214899713467049
