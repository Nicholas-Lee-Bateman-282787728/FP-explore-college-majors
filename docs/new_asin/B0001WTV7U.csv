2035538,3,B0001WTV7U,"A KISS SO DEADLY has so many things wrong with it, I find myself surprised to give it three stars.  Overall, I found myself enjoying the premise, although it's fairly obvious early on what's going to happen.  The scriptwriter throws in an obvious red herring, but once the movie picks up, it becomes pretty evident who the murderer is.  Charles Shaughnnessy's character is so unlikeable, it's easy to overlook his character, and focus on the younger ones.  Deedee Pfeiffer does a credible job as his daughter and Charlotte Ross as the vixen Amanda is quite good.  Kerrie Keane does a good job as Shaughnessy's puzzled wife.  Even with its erratic pacing and derivative context, it still manages to be okay entertainment.",1110672000,6,720,4.909090909090909

2035559,3,B0001WTV7U,"A father (Charles Shaughnessy) enters into an affair the his daughter's friend (Charlotte Ross, who is actually the seducer in the relationship). When she ends up murdered, he goes into overdrive trying to keep the illicit affair a secret from his wife and daughter. The premise is okay, the acting passable... The storyline wouldn't be so disturbing had Ross not portrayed Shaughnessy's daughter for six seasons on ""Days of Our Lives"" ... ick! Plays occasionally on Lifetime Movie Network, so save your money.",1181001600,,510,5.156626506024097
8017298,5,B0001WTV7U,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1996 and directed by Chuck Bowman, ""A Kiss So Deadly"" is a drama with elements of romance & crime starring Charles Shaughnessy as Tom Deese, a concerned father whos concerned about his daughter who moved out to live on her own (Dedee Pfeiffer).  Living with two roommates on the North Carolina coast (Charlotte Ross & Noelle Parker), the girls are sorta stalked by a creepy man (Scott Simpson); meanwhile, Deese becomes infatuated with one of the roommates (Ross). Kerrie Keane plays Deeses ignored wife while Tom Bresnahan plays the daughters beau.

Although this is a TV movie, it breaks the threshold of greatness for what it is; and does so on a few fronts. The theme revolves around the power of a beautiful woman and the corresponding male obsession. Ross stands out as the hottie and her beauty is highlighted from the get-go (the father stumbles upon her in a bikini in his daughters apartment and you can just see Whoa, Mama! displayed on his face).

Unfortunately, Amanda (Ross) has developed the faintly unwholesome disposition of a babe who is won't to sleep around. She is nicely contrasted by the intuitive insightfulness of the daughter (Pfeiffer) and the winsome wholesomeness of the other girl, June (Parker). Speaking of whom, I enjoyed Junes subplot in the third act, which nicely contrasts Amandas relationship with Deese. I wish it were developed more. Personally, if I were to pursue any of the three girls (not that I would, since Im married), it would be June.

Any male who has experienced the inward upheaval that goes with a crazy crush on a beautiful woman will relate to what the father goes through in this flick. A Kiss So Deadly effectively shows the potential dangers of uncontrolled infatuation. Be wise, my son.

THE MOVIE RUNS 96 minutes and was shot in Wilmington, North Carolina. WRITERS:  Monica Parker (story) &Nevin Schreiner (story & script).
