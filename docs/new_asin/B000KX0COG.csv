8159520,4,B000KX0COG,"This is such an odd little workout.  Unlike other fitness DVDs, the trainer and her students in this workout aren't perfect physical specimens nor are they coordinated (at some point in the workout, they lose their balance.). And at the end of the standing work, a police siren goes off.

 But somehow, it's these imperfections that make this entertaining.  Definitely helps with balance but because it's not intense, it didn't really change my lower body.",1478822400,,456,5.04
8159521,5,B000KX0COG,The butt&thigh blast workout is a gem of a workout.  No time is wasted during the short 23 minute workout.  Jeanette Jenkins gives excellent cuing and instructions. I have completed this workout several times and it is one of my favorites for my lower body.  It is not a cardio workout but I am breathing hard because she never stops.  I am probably an intermediate level.  If it ever becomes too easy I plan to add light ankle weights to make it harder(I am unsure it will ever become easy through).,1445299200,,500,4.450549450549451
