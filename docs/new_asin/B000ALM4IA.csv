2389710,1,B000ALM4IA,"I am an American Indian. I am responsible through ceremonies and the words coming out of my mouth to speak truthfully to my relations. While this film has some useful historical observations, it is in essence a paranoid work of propaganda that takes everybody back rather than forward. The film entirely ignores the struggles in the east and southwest, the west coast and the indigenous tribes (Hopi) of the southwest. it leaves out many things. It substitutes an unrelenting narrative to point the finger at all the bad Indians who stood in the way of the United States government. Custer is praised. The Indians were all so very cruel to their captives..... It parades the Indians out as freaks and monsters who deserve all the trouble they get in life. This film is horribly inaccurate and misleading. There is not a single voice of any American Indian dead or alive. the thinking behind this film is very dark, manipulative and incorrect in my view. I have spent more than forty years of my life monitoring, studying and asking questions about the words and images which pass for information about the American Indian. This film series is so retro, it is so unbearably white, which is not a compliment. This film is incorrect in more ways than I have the heart and words to say. In good faith I do say that as an American Indian, and a United States Army Veteran, that this film has a dark agenda. I am deeply sad that it has been made and is being distributed as something factual and historical. I encourage those of you who may know American Indian people to share this film with them and watch their reaction. When will we ever get together and know the real and actual, set us all free truth about these issues?",1248912000,61,1720,4.605863192182411
2389711,5,B000ALM4IA,"Very educational.

The documentary goes from the early years of the indian people to the taking of their land.

Just what i expected to undertand what happened during all those years and to understand the life of the indian people.

Buy it for enjoyment and collection.",1229212800,2,269,4.804347826086956
2389712,1,B000ALM4IA,"This work is poor on many levels.

Cinematically, it's dull, with a narrator using a strange sensationalized voice doing most of the talking through the series with scant input from a few so called scholars that no one has ever heard of - generally supporting the point of view of the settlers.

As far as history, this is mostly a history of the wars on the Plains, which have a tendency to skip in a hodgepodge manner and miss the historical context in favor of military battlefield tactics.  So, for instance, Red Cloud's War is presented as an Indian reaction to Sand Creek, and a series of military engagements - instead of looking at the objections to the Bozeman Trail and why war was waged on the relatively new route to the mines in Montana.

The early history of the rise of nomadic plains culture is deplorably bad, mis-stating repeatedly how horses ended up in the Plains and completely neglecting the role that smallpox played in decimating the Plains agriculturalists.  It makes it sound as if horses and horsemanship magically appeared with mustangs on the North American continent independent from trade.

There is a lot to say about the re-interpretation of Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, but it's not worth going there.

For so many hours of footage, it's amazing how much is lacking while how much minutiae of battle detail is looked at.  If a broad series like this wants to look at battles, do a movie on a battle.  But, for this, a more contextual look is necessary.

So, cinematically, this is a dull production with poor production values.  And, historically, it's a shoddy piece that misses the point of these extremely sad chapters in history.",1223078400,10,1667,4.753472222222222
2389713,4,B000ALM4IA,"This collection will probably hold little new to those already familiar with Native American history, but such people are sadly few and far between these days.  I picked this set up on a whim, due largely to its rock-bottom price and nicely constructed packaging.  And I must say, I've been pleasantly surprised.  No, the reenactments are not terribly high budget, but the invective elicited from other reviewers seems largely unmerited.

No, the Native tribes are not depicted as sub-human savages, brutes or monsters.  But what seems to anger some people is that the Whites are not dehumanized either.  The documentaries take great pains to show the motivations, strengths, heroes, villains, foibles, massacres, and misunderstandings on both sides.  Both Whites and Natives attack civilians.  Both Whites and Native break treaties.  Both Whites and Natives attempt to learn from one another and to live in peace.  Both White and Natives engage in raiding, conquest, and slave trade.  Meanwhile, fair attention is paid to other players, such as the famous and hard-fighting Buffalo Soldiers.  Some seem aghast at the fact that this program points out roughly equal numbers of casualties on both sides in the Indian Wars, as if this robbed Native tribes of their victimhood.  I just saw it as evidence that the Natives were skilled, brave warriors, who were far more effective against the US military over the years than we are often led to believe.

Previously, many narratives of the Indian Wars portrayed Euro-Americans as chivalrous and noble, while Natives were violent and untrustworthy.  In the last generation, that image has been turned on its head.  It seems that whenever a human society encounters another radically different culture, the only way that society can make sense of the other is to either deify them or to demonize them.  We can see strangers as angels or devils, but not as people.  For whatever flaws it has, this set treats both sides as human, both flawed and beautiful.",1213315200,112,1999,5.079754601226994
2389714,1,B000ALM4IA,"I agree 100% with Reviewer Douglas. I would of given it 0 stars if I could. Every massacre to the Indians seemed almost justified. If you really want to learn the truth of what really happened I would suggest getting a hold of the documentary ""500 Nations"". Its far better cinematically and historically with eyewitness accounts from both sides.",1146873600,28,345,4.864406779661017
2389715,5,B000ALM4IA,"Revisionists and White history supporters beware, this DVD series on America's Indian Wars tells it like it really was in the bad old days of the wild west.  Atrocities on both sides, hereoes and butchers on both sides. For too long Americans have been fed pap - the Indians were terrorists and the Cavalry heroes and vice versa.  How wonderful to find a series that gives the fair and balanced truth of what really happened in America's fight for the west.  Thanks to the experts - Greg Michno and Jeremy Bloom, men who have spent years investigating the battles of the Plains Indians war - the reality of what happended is finally known.  Curl up with this DVD this winter and amaze your friends with the facts of the Indian Wars instead of the BS.  Teacher from Green Bay, WI.",1140220800,31,779,4.535714285714286
2389716,1,B000ALM4IA,"This film was incredibly disappointing considering the relative deficiency of film work in this field. This DVD set is historically irresponsible in a number of ways, for example, the film continually shows a picture of Crazy Horse when referring to him, but most anyone with even a cursory knowledge of American Indian History knows Crazy Horse was never photographed. Story-lines are vague. Figures and numbers offered always favor the American Military. Indians depicted in live-action re-creations constantly are shown as a group, brutally beating American soldiers. Wounded Knee is reffered to as the ""last great battle."" The Sand Creek massacre is borderline depicted as being deserved. Ethically debateable American military leaders are depicted in a heroic light.

This film set is designed for White American males who get excited about old westerns that depict Indians as savage idiots. If this set was ever used in a classroom I only hope it would serve as an example of what is wrong with America's handling of Indian History.

No Indian people were interviewed for this film. No Indian people were used in re-enactments. No reputable scholars appear in the film. The Pro-American white men that are interviewed in the film are people I have never heard of in all my years as an Indian History scholar. Id really like to know what the film-maker's sources were for their research. The film contributes nothing relevant or new to the field. If you are a scholar in the field of 19th Century and American Indian History, stay away from this film unless you are looking for laughs or an opportunity to degrade your knowledge.",1137369600,76,1634,5.048148148148148

It also shows old photos that don't match the narrative that accompany them. On the positive side, it includes even some of the relatively minor confrontations and that actually helps bind events and their importance together.

2389743,2,B000ALM4IA,"This series will reinforce the false histories of court historians for American empire.  Fans of this false history ignore the fact that the US was formed as a confederacy of independent states, and later reformed as a republic, not an empire.  By studiously ignoring earlier policies of genocide used against the eastern indian tribes and concentrating on the invented narrative of the ""settling"" of the lands belonging to indian tribes and nations in the west, this string of myths is made to seem true by carefully ignoring the history of the wars of genocide that actually took place.

  War criminals Sherman and Sheridan are presented as heroic heroes who ""saved America"" by slaughtering not only the buffalo, but the men, women and children whose lives depended on the huge herds, and by destroying the horse herds and personal properties of indian peoples such as their portable lodges, food stocks, clothing and tools.

  The fact that Kit Carson led the attack which murdered 400+ Navajo at the the cavern site now known as the cave of the dead isn't mentioned.  His policy of destroying Navajo homes, livestock, personal property, and farmed fields and orchards is presented as a necessary move, and not as the atrocity that it was.

  War lovers and worshipers of false history will love this series.  Anyone hoping to learn actual history will be cheated of the $.01 plus $3.99 shipping cost of this dvd.",1448323200,3,1417,4.928270042194093

The second sentence of the documentary is also false.  They state that the Indians had ""created great civilizations equaling anything found in Europe.""  Then they show a picture of Mesa Verde.  What a joke.  At the same time Indians were mixing up mud to make Mesa Verde, the Europeans were building great cathedrals, any of which were a 1,000 times as at great an achievement as Mesa Verde.  The Indians didn't even have metal.

2389808,4,B000ALM4IA,"There are NO ""native"" Americans.  There never were.

""Clovis man"" and associated tribes crossed from Eurasia tens of thousands of years ago.  Apparently, an Extinction Level Event (E.L.E.) occurred about 13,000 years ago that wiped out hundreds of species...INCLUDING CLOVIS MAN! So he was the first human ""American"" inhabitant and came from the East.

Later, more Eurasians followed and became the second ""American"" inhabitants and established civilizations such as the Maya, Inca, and Puebloans.  We euphemistically call them ""native Americans"" for political purposes.  ""Heck, we sailed our ships across a great sea and found somebody, so let's call them natives.""  How about ""indigenous""?

The Europeans were simply the THIRD ""American"" inhabitants.  You can call them ""invaders"", but lands have been conquered and people displaced for TENS of millennia on ALL CONTINENTS.

If you want to learn more, check out ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"".  Its cave paintings are 32,000 years old.  Go to the La Brea tar pits.  And then there's the excellent ""Journey of Man"".  There were never any ""native"" Americans.  They were just here before the Europeans.

Amazon.com will show the threads, if anyone will take the time to LOOK!

To bad the term ""Indian"" ever stuck, but it WAS all about Europeans looking for the Indies.  I'd really prefer ""Anasazi"" for all that were here before the Europeans.  They just aren't ""native"".",1370304000,4,1415,5.236607142857143

There are lots of facts included here about the migrations of the Indian groups, their prosperity as a result of horses and how the tribes interacted with each other before the settlers. Being a firm believer in sociological factors, this narrative sounds pretty darned believable to me and even if it does lean a little to the right, it's still a breath of fresh air in comparison to the lob-sided ""evil white man vs peace-loving indians"" crap I've been listening to for forty years.

I had hoped to learn at least a little about the Eastern Indian conflicts, which were arguably more important than the Plains conflicts. The Eastern Indian conflicts could have been won by the Eastern Indians and their allies; if so, the USA would have been considerably different.

2389813,4,B000ALM4IA,"I saw this and figured for $5, why not. I'm almost through viewing it, and I read some of the prior reviews. To those that say it's biased and racist, you must have been asleep...because here's just one part of a narration, verbatim..""At a bend on the Big Sandy on November 29th 1864 over 100 Cheyenne, mostly women and children, were massacred by a United States military force commanded by the Indian-hating Col. John Shippington. Led by Black Kettle, these Indians were moving towards accommodation with Washington's desire to place all nomadic Indians on reservations where they would learn a sedentary lifestyle..""

That does not sound racist or biased. It's what happened.

Anyways, I am finding fascinating information, such as the ""Great Horse Dispersal""....something I knew very little of. And how it let to one of the most rapid diffusions of technology in human history. SO much I had to know more, which let me to more and more..

This is a great PRIMER and eye-opener on AmerInd relations and the 40 year black-eye in American History we get glossed over in school by ""how the west was won"" and ""Gunsmoke"". The producers stuff a LOT of information into 235 minutes. Yes I understand that like any large body of work, there are some minor detail flaws but again, if you WANT to see it as something more than it is (racist, biased, etc) you undoubtedly will. If you view it with an open mind, you'll see just how badly we dealt with the Native Americans. And suffice it to say that the U.S isn't alone in that respect; Such things occurred in Australia and S. Africa...but those are subjects of another discussion. To me it does appear that  the producers went to great lengths to compile a LOT of data into  digestible pieces; however, as was said, the narrator tends to be a bit overdramatic and boring. And as another reviewer, it appears they want to try the Ken Burns' style but just don't quite get it. That's the only thing I can say in the negative. Otherwise I give it two thumbs up for the information within. If it piques your curiosity to learn more about the events, it's done it's job. I have not finished it, as now I'm into the War for the Northern Plains. Having lived in SE Arizona for 23 years, I am familiar with Geronimo and Cochise and Ft.

The maps are so grossly simplified as to be wrong. Some of the photographs of individuals are identified incorrectly.

2389834,4,B000ALM4IA,"This interesting DVD Documentry provides some overview of the Plains Wars and a little about Indian Wars in general.  This perhaps makes the title a bit deceptive.  This is mostly about the Western Tribes of the Great Plains and their early migrations and how they became horse peoples and their final stand against white encroachment in the late 1900s.  This is also primarily a Military History of the subject with a straight-forward account without any of the eulogizing often associated with this topic.  Attrocities were committed by both Red and White man and this series does not hold back.

The first DVD deals in depth with the individual Western Tribes and how they settled and become Horse Peoples.  The 2nd deals with the advance of the US Cavalry out West and provides some good detail about Soldier life and how they adapted to fight the red man.  These battles were by no means one sided and attrocities were freely committed by both sides.

There is a section about the great war chiefs and surprisingly little about Custer and Little Big Horn which may disappoint some.  For me I was glad that the focus was elsewhere as this chapter of the Indian wars is well covered.

The 3rd DVD deals with the battle for the Northern Plains with all the famous Tribes associated with it.  The 4th DVD deals with the battle for the Southern Plains and Texas.  Less well known this information was quite detailed and interesting.

Again, its too bad a 5th DVD could not have dealt with the Eastern Tribes more.  These and their conflicts are just summarized on the 2nd DVD which does give a good chronology of events.  I guess another DVD set would be required to do justice to the Indian wars of the Eastern Woodlands.

This is a budget production, with a few minor tracking problems.  There are not a lot of nice graphics, and maps are sparsely used.

If you are interested in anything concerning the The Indian Wars of the American West from the 1850s through 1890 this will be of great value to you, the DVD also traces some history too from the 1540s, especially concerning the acquisition by the Indians of the plains of the Spanish horses.  Using black and white and color this DVD offers a very effective explanation of those troubled times.

2389837,5,B000ALM4IA,"This movie is in no way biased.  It presents both sides, white and indian, with honesty.  It noted atrocities, such as, torture and scalping that were done by both sides.  This disappoints those who prefer the cruel white invaders stomping on the noble red man stuff.  Those who say it is biased for the whites are really just disappointed that it wasn't biased for the indians.  The politically correct crowd, you know.

 It is not a high budget film, many still photographs are used.  However, the still photographs work well with the narration and actually give you time to study the places and faces of the people of that time in a way moving pictures can't. I assume those who complain about the use of still pictures are too young to remember that cameras in those days didn't take moving pictures.

One of the things that struck me is the way the film pointed out bad and good on both sides.  I was surprised to read the reviews stating, in error, that the film is biased.  I would say to them, the ""Great Indian Wars"" are over, so get over it.  You are just as silly as those who can't get over the south losing the civil war.  If you think the country should be given back to the indians, write your congressman, senator or the president.  Maybe they will give it back.  Why not, they've almost ruined it anyway.
