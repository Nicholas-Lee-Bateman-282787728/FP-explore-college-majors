8544211,1,096783130X,"It was my fault for not reading the small print, but the tape sent is not about Prostate Cancer. The detail of all the used copies on 6/18/03 of this item states that the tape is about prostate cancer but with a different title, Enlarged Prostate. An enlarged prostate (BHP) is a non-cancerous condition and the discussion has little to do with prostate cancer. For a man with prostate cancer this tape is not at all helpful. The person selling these tapes either does not understand the difference between an enlarged prostate and prostate cancer or is misleading us too.",1055980800,,572,4.73
8544212,5,096783130X,"This film was not only informative, but compelling in it's presentation of men struggling with this dread disease.  It really is a ""must see"" for any man with a history of prostate cancer in his family -- or  anyone over 40!
I shared with all the men in my family -- you should too!",958003200,2,282,4.203703703703703
