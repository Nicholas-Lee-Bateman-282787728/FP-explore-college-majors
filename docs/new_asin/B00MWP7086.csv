6603732,1,B00MWP7086,"I am curious if you know if this will be the edited versions that have been previously released (butchered in my opinion) or if these will finally be the full non-syndicated versions as originally broadcast.  Does anyone know?

I'd give it five stars if it's indeed the original broadcasts.  But if it isn't, it gets barely 1 star.  I'll start with 1 star, as I have a feeling it'll be the chopped versions.  ('cuz they're cheaper!  Don't have to pay for music rights, and you don't have to do any work to go find the original broadcast versions, you can just grab the syndicated versions and plop them out on video)

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",1409270400,12,660,4.589743589743589

6603745,4,B00MWP7086,"Great 80s show. Very funny and original with great writing, directing, and acting. Unfortunately, starting with season 6, the show quality seriously declined and lost most of the magic it had in earlier episodes. Acting became very far-fetched and unrealistic, especially with Steven Keaton (father). His character seemed to overact to everything and and also got dumber and dumber as time went by. Plus, writing quality really declined. It appears they simply ran out of ideas, or just gave up caring. One other problem is some of the earlier season episodes are mixed in with later seasons. This is ridiculous and there is no excuse. Overall, I highly recommend seasons 1-5. Most season 6 and 7 episodes aren't worth the time in my opinion.",1497830400,2,742,4.991935483870968

Once I saw how much they had the price listed on it, I decided I better just get my own copy, then worry about ruining their copy and paying retail for it. Well worth it! I decided to get this version since it was cheaper and in a hard case vs. the photo album version which is nice but big and bulky. The tv movie is included in it, which I don't remember ever seeing before. It also has a couple of episodes that are out of order (ones where Andrew is a baby in one episode and another where's he's 5-6). Not a big deal and it's on both versions released.

6603772,4,B00MWP7086,"First, this is a great set at a great price. I found it cheaper at Target, so that is where I got mine. However, the episodes are not in chronological order, and there are episodes within the wrong seasons. For instance, one episode will have a 6 year old Andy, and the very next episode will have a very young Jennifer and Andy hasn't been born yet. It seems like if they skipped an episode somewhere, they just stuck it wherever they had space (even in the wrong season). I feel many of the episodes are out of order. Luckily, this was not a cliffhanger show that had to be watched in order. Other than that, the show takes me back to the 80's and my own middle school years. If the shows were in order, I would definitely give it 5 stars...maybe it had something to do with the fact that this show originally aired on NBC and this set is put out by CBS.",1457308800,7,856,4.162650602409639

6603777,5,B00MWP7086,"I've been obsessed with this series ever since my parents brought it up one day years ago. I found it on Netflix and blew through season one is a couple of days by watching it while I was doing homework or on the treadmill or on my break at work or what have you, so when I saw that it was on box set I decided to order it because who doesn't love box sets? It comes in two separate plastic cases inside of the box, and the DVDs are nicely packaged inside of the cases. I thought it was perfect packaging. Not too hard to open, but not so flimsy that I thought the DVDs would be in danger. I've had box sets come where the DVDs are all just stacked on top of each other, so I thought this packaging was much better. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the series",1450656000,6,774,4.0

Fox, ""Back To The Future"", ""Teen Wolf""), Mallory (Justine Bateman, ""Satisfaction"", ""Right To Kill?""), Jennifer (Tina Yothers, ""Family Ties Vacation"", ""Shoot The Moon""), & Andy (Brian Bonsell, ""Blank Check"", ""Father & Scout"") who are whiney, disrespectful, greedy, and inmature.

The original complete series photo album package with the extra bonus features disc seemed great, but not the high price. I'm so glad they released this repackaged version, it may not have the extra disc, but it still has a few bonus features and is much more affordable. This is the previously released season by season discs brought together in one package, which includes the Family Ties Vacation TV movie as part of set. The real jewel of this set is that they left the final episode "" Alex doesn't live here anymore"" as it was originally aired with the casts final curtain call and goodbye credits. This final episode has always been sadly chopped into two parts and edited for time in syndication. Even Netflix only has the syndicated version, which doesn't include the final curtain call or goodbye credits.

It took a long time to get through the first season, and I wondered why I had liked the show so much during the 1980s. Then the second season came along. Wow! What a difference. The opening titles, the writing, the acting, the use of the strengths of the actors (especial MJ Fox's gift for physical comedy) improved 100%. I'm a little more than halfway through the first season now and really looking forward to the rest. :)",1518912000,,517,4.51063829787234
