Just One Bite - After discovering that Squidward has never tried a krabby patty, Spongebob tries to get the cranky squid to try one. When Squidward finally gives in and tries one, he loves it. But if Spongebob finds out, he'll never hear the end of it!
Mermaidman and Barnacleboy - After learning their favorite superhero team Mermaidman and Barnacleboy have retired, Spongebob and Patrick rush down to the retirement home to convince them to return to fighting crime. With two wily old coots like them, it won't be easy!
Tea at the Treedome - Spongebob meets a squirrel named Sandy Cheeks. She invites him over for tea and cookies at her treedome. When Spongebob shows up, though, he can't take the air! Will he be able to play it fancy while he gradually dries out?
The Paper - Squidward throws away a gum wrapper, but Spongebob takes it, immediately returning it to him. Squidward doesn't want it and lets Spongebob keep it. But after finding out how much fun the wrapper actually can be, he wants it back!
Born Again Krabs - Mr. Krabs tries to sell a spoiled krabby patty. Since no one will bite, he does, leading to a near-death experience. Now he has to prove that he can be generous, or else the Flying Dutchman will take him to DAVY JONE'S LOCKER!
