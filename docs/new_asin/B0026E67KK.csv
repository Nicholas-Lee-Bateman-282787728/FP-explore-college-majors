8352510,5,B0026E67KK,"Box Elder is a tremendous debut feature from Todd Sklar. It is not a typical college comedy or the beer drinking, random sex variety. True, there is plenty of beer drinking and sex, but this film offers so much more. It is as if the French New Wave directors were alive and kicking today and they chose to tackle the subject of college. The soundtrack is filled with great rock and roll, the cinematography is elegant and thoughtful, and the film is just plain hilarious. The 2 disc DVD is also a must have, it's filled with hilarious outtakes and the box features a great review of the film that is very poignant and insightful. Let's do it.",1264464000,5,642,4.4491525423728815
8352511,4,B0026E67KK,"If Kevin Smith began the wave of independent films over the next 15 years,  director Todd Sklarr's heartfelt comedy is certainly part of a pack of films [...] again redefining how films are made and distributed.  If you like films like Clerks and Swingers, this is definitely one worth checking out.",1263945600,3,299,4.8431372549019605
