8092939,4,B000BUJU8C,"I was one of the fortunate ones to see DIE SISTER, DIE! (1972) in the 70's. I first saw this movie as a child and loved it, I still do. A very mysterious and eerie story is told in a dramatic way that completely pulls you in. As for the cast, it is quite good and it seemed like a TV movie at times. I sort of knew this going in, but I saw this when I was a child and it really affected me because it is such a creepy and mysterious story.

Acting was good but a bit dry. There was an emotion that was expected and an energy between many of the characters. Not a scary film in the traditional sense, but far more of a murder mystery to me than any horror movie because of the aforementioned themes.

Thought I'd see how it held up all these years, and it did hold up well.",1382918400,2,772,3.8797468354430378
