1735586,2,B000069HUD,"The sparse synopsis and only 1 review compelled me to watch this film so that I could review it.  Overall it was not bad.  A plodding psychological thriller, there is minimal gore (corpses) so I'm not exactly sure it falls under the 'horror' category.

The story is about Mr. Matthews, an ex-drug addict from New York who attends a criminology seminar in Atwater Commons, near Cape Cod, in order to 'understand the death of his mother'.  At first I assumed she was the victim of a serial killer because, you know, that would make sense.  Or that at least he was directly responsible for her death and feared he may be a serial killer.  But no, she died in a car accident.  So there's confusing plot point #1.

Atwater Commons is home to Atwater Bridges, author of the popular serial killer account 'Dirt Boy'.  The book is supposedly fiction, but the story treats it as if it's historical fact at times...Confusing plot point #2.  Especially when Mr. Matthews, with no law enforcement background whatsoever, begins retracing the steps of the 'fictional' Dirt Boy and discovering corpses in the exact locations described.  The first one I can almost buy, but then a second such occurrence?  I wouldn't have gone corpse hunting again for fear of seeming suspicious, and since law enforcement was called to the scene I WOULD look pretty suspicious.  Plus the fact that, upon discovery of the first body, it was the amateur searching for more and not actual police.  If a scene in a 'fictional' book turned out to be true the first thing I would do as a detective would be to scour the other scenes described....Confusing plot point #3.

But the townspeople are so loaded due to sales of the book (almost $100k annually for the town library and $150k for carpenters) it is implied that the townspeople are covering up the truth, but never really explained to what extent.  In reality the author himself of 1 popular book wouldn't even be earning that much, and God only knows how one book could pump that much revenue into a town....Confusing plot point #4.  When the true murders become public the book is banned and the tourist season takes a hit. This really angers the townsfolk.  In reality if 'fictional' murders turned out to be true, book sales would soar and MORE tourists would flock to the place....Confusing plot point #5.

Mr. Matthews is on the trail of a bona fide serial killer and persists despite the creepy, ominous neighborhood kid, the warning of a detective in the same seminar, an attempt on his own life and other major red flags that would certainly send me packing back to New York.  At times you wonder 'Is Mr. Matthews the killer, inspired by the book?'  'Is Atwater Bridges, the nutty author, living out his own story?'  'Is the killer one, or all, of the creepy town residents?'

I won't ruin the ending, because most of the plot IS explained (with only 30 mins left in the movie and still no resolution, I was kinda worried).  Not a bad movie, but be prepared to suspend belief.  Don't watch this if you're expecting true horror, if you've ever worked in law enforcement, or if (like me) you tend to over-analyze details in movies that would never happen in real life.",1354492800,18,3195,4.6625
1735587,4,B000069HUD,"I was a little confused by the opening.  I stuck with it, though.  It turned out to be surprisingly thoughtful, bringing attention to horror/serial killer novels.  I found the subtle and, and particularly the not-so-subtle, ""creepy"" elements to be delightful.  The acting was pretty good, too.",1347062400,2,293,5.304347826086956

1735591,4,B000069HUD,"This is a strange little story infused with both mystery and humor. The humor may be unintended but somehow it works.
It gets a bit surreal at times and gets a little convoluted and confusing. This is a movie you have to pay very close attention to.
The acting is good although there's almost a satirical quality to it. perhaps that's unintentional as well.

1735595,4,B000069HUD,"PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW!!  Okay, the bad first, get it out of the way.  This is an extremely low budget movie.  There are numerous technical errors and some of the casting decisions were unfortunate.  Very early into the credits, maybe the fourth one or so, in large text, a production designer is title a ""deisgner"".  This is the kind of mistake that will get an independent film laughed out of the screening.  The acting wasn't atrocious for the majority but the police officer, the park ranger, and the boy on the bike needed more practice. Some of the dialogue was written so it came out very hard to believe.  The first exchange between Matty and Atwater is flawed because while Atwater was hilarious, Matty would not have spoken so calmly or used that wording. Oh, a tap from a bumper won't likely put someone halfway under the car, guys! The likelihood of a young kid remembering all the boy told Matty is low. But the main objection I had was to the multitude of vicious comments hurled at Matty by Atwater and the cop...no one would have actually taken that so calmly without so much as a plea to stop.  The actor playing Matty could have been brilliant just losing control there.  The audio was okay most of the movie but there is scene, when Matty is on the boat, that the music is so loud you can't hear what Matty says.  I say these things not to be cruel but constructive and I hope if anyone tied to this film is reading they will see this, because here is the good part.  I loved this movie!!!!  It is wrongly categorized as horror, as it's more a suspense/mystery.  There is truly not a single scary scene but the mystery is intriguing.  While the above mentioned errors may cause some to not give this one a chance, this would be a mistake since it has what so many films lack, heart and vision.  I thought the three leads, Matty, Atwater, and Brooke, were really good actors, especially in the very last scene before the credits.  The artwork between chapters is gorgeous.  The plot is fascinating and if ""Dirt Boy"" is actually a real book, I am going to be reading it. The fact that everyone involved was thanked during the credits is one of the reasons these type of films are so great.  You know everyone in that small town was at the screening getting a thrill to see themselves and/or their names on the screen.  Big budget movies have so many credits that roll so fast you just don't get to see that.
And the most important reason I wanted anyone to read this entire review...do not stop watching until the short list of credits has ended or you will miss a little bonus scene.  Yes, it's unconvincing but it's just so pricelessly hilarious it's not to be missed!",1412640000,2,2690,4.4621676891615545

1735597,1,B000069HUD,"Not only a poor movie but Amazon offers such a low resolution video that it can't even fill the screen in full screen mode.  This is the kind of company Amazon has become, very sad.",1404864000,,181,4.171428571428572
1735598,3,B000069HUD,"It was ok, not terrible but definitely not scary. It is more of a mystery, a whodunnit with a good amount of detective work in a weird little town. It's a one time watch good for a rainy day, that is if you've seen everything else worth seeing already and you don't mind a sort of '80s feel. I felt the actors did a pretty good job actually. That's one reason why I wouldn't give it less than 3 stars. I would say watch it if it seems like your style of movie.",1404518400,,460,3.956989247311828

1735600,3,B000069HUD,"There's not a whole lot to be said other than what's already been written in earlier reviews.  Story was not that original, but a good concept.  The acting was alright; did not completely buy into what the protagonist's or antagonist's characters as we understood them to be.  As far as the direction and general flow of the movie, well, unless you have nothing better to watch and have had a full night's sleep, you'll be able to stay with it until the end (my husband and I like a lot of B movies, but this was a B movie AND slow).  It's not as if there was enough artistic branding to warrant it being as slow (in order to develop character, plot, or anything else).  Meh, I'm rating it a generous three stars.",1399248000,,713,4.330827067669173
1735601,4,B000069HUD,"Dirt Boy is more of a psychological thriller. The protagonist is searching for answers and stumbles onto a secret. The reaction of the town to his discovery is pretty amusing. It kept me engaged as I tried, along with the protag, to figure out the secret. The gradual reveals were well plotted, moving the pace along. Its a quiet kind of film, more of an experience for the mind than a visceral sensory based movie. I remained a spectator throughout, never forgetting I was watching a movie, unsure if it was due to the incredulity of the story (not meant as a criticism), or the acting (which was mainly adequate but kind of tongue in cheek for some characters), A decent choice for a low key afternoon, not a prime time hour.",1397520000,7,727,4.515151515151516
1735602,5,B000069HUD,"There were times when I was afraid I was watching something artsy fartsy and metephorical,  I almost stopped watching it for fear that it was just another drug induced lump of coal,  but it kept pulling me back and I kept watching.  It has a complex storyline so it needs your full attention.  There is a lot going on and in the end it all comes together for a satisfying ending. I have to say it reminds me of a story Hitchcock would have done.  I will be watching for more from Jay Frasco.",1396396800,2,491,4.180851063829787
1735603,3,B000069HUD,"A man named Matty Matthews travels from New York to Atwater Commons in Cape Cod for a criminal investigation seminar. Along the way, he listens to a book on tape about the Atwater Commons murderer known only as DIRT BOY. While in Atwater Commons, Matty discovers a local radio station playing the DIRT BOY story on a daily basis. He listens intently to the exploits of the title character. Matty soon finds himself retracing the killer's steps, and visiting the murder sites in the story. He even digs up one of the victims' graves, and it has a fresh corpse in it! Matty continues to follow DIRT BOY's trail, and finds another body! Atwater residents become offended, believing that Matty is ruining the town's reputation and bringing unwanted attention. The story of DIRT BOY appears to be the only concern of the entire town! Matty hears what he believes to be a radio DJ telling someone to cover their tracks. It's even spoken in code! What the hell is going on? Is a copy cat on the loose? Is there some sort of town-wide conspiracy, or is Matty losing his grip on reality? DIRT BOY is an odd, somewhat overdone story of murder, mystery, and madness. It's also a quiet, subtle film w/ little action. I did enjoy its creep factor, though one viewing was enough...",1393286400,,1267,4.610619469026549

1735605,3,B000069HUD,"A bit on the strange side. Not bad but not quite great either, interesting concept, different. I love something different, sometimes I feel like the god emperor dune, nothing is new. This almost made me want to give it a four but I give to many 3+ movies a 4 and even though I found it interesting it really wasn't that entertaining. If you feel like thinking watch it through if you want to be entertained watch the avengers, they both have their time, depending on mood.",1377302400,3,472,4.436781609195402
1735606,5,B000069HUD,"This positive review is real. I have nothing to do with this production. Noone in this production gave me or owes me money. With that said, there is nothing b-movie about this. I love the whole playing on reality that will make people look up to see if Dirt Boy is indeed a true novel. That's the kind of genius Lovecraft, Stephen King and Clive Barker possess.
The movie looks great, sounds great, has some great music. The only negative is some occasional weak acting but it's totally forgivable.
A whole town obsessed with a book because of its success and the prosperity it brings, sort of like living near Area 51 or the house Ed Gein lived in. I'm sure it's a love/hate relationship for those folks--you hate the reason people come but you benefit from their business. Only in this town, people LOVE the attention and really own it. That's what creates the smalltown's convincing cult mentality in this movie.
Great movie.",1375660800,,928,4.664634146341464
1735607,3,B000069HUD,"Dirt Boy was a mix bag of odd parameters infused into the story aimed at adding mystery, believability and to enhance the causation of the chain of events that led to the murders. DB is NOT a horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller that revolves around an ex-junky a one hit wonder author and the odd little town the author lives. The town and its residents are beholden to the author for the astronomical amount of money (this makes no sense) his books revenues brings to them. Mr. Matthews is a lost soul looking for understanding and forgiveness in regards to the loss of his mother in a car accident. He visits Atwater Commons to attend a two week seminar on understanding serial killers and their apprehension which is odd to say the least since his mom died in a car accident. I am not sure why this would help him heal from his loss or maybe it is some weird way for him to help understand death and its effects on people? I just don't see the link to serial killer seminar except for the book DB that he doesn't know about until he arrives in the town? Matthews character gets caught up in the Dirt Boy book and starts to investigate the books murders (I guess he was driven from the seminar) and guess what he finds ??? The story keeps getting more bizarre with his discovery from the reactions of the locals as well as the lack of a visible law enforcement presence and their actions. I was going to give some detailed info on all the bizarre quirks in this story, but that would reveal to much so I won't. This story loosely reminds me of a Stephen King story only a lot more disjointed and lacking a much needed polishing job for clarification and cohesion. I say that becauce of the small New England town feel, his older car (not a classic) and the strange story. So I've listed a few of the oddities that present themselves in this story to give you an idea of what you are up against as a guide to the bizarre nature of this story. The acting and direction are good, but as described before the story needs work and in the hands of a good writer I think that this would make for a great movie. I must say that even with all the quirks in the writing I still enjoyed this movie and its odd ball characters and its little town full of mysterious residents. I seldom will enjoy a movie that has so many quirks in the writing or a combination of issues that include acting, direction, editing and so on. I hope if you give this movie a try that you can overlook its flaws and still be able to enjoy the story as is unfolds to its conclusion. 3 stars

1735608,1,B000069HUD,"The positive reviews are fake. This movie is so boring and crappy that I can't think of anyone who could like this. This is NOT a horror movie. This would be accurately described as a ""dramatic thriller"". There isn't any gore. Nor is there suspense because the protagonists are never in any danger til the last 10-15 mins. But even then I couldn't feel suspense because the acting and characterizations are so awful that I couldn't feel scared for the characters. I bought this in an 8-horror movie pack so that makes it around 65 cents a movie. But I still think I could have used that 65 cents for something better.

The people behind this movie obviously were going for a deep psychological piece about grief and guilt and the search for redemption but they end up with a confusing almost comical mess.  It had some interesting plot points especially the idea of a fictional novel actually being an autobiography of sorts.  The book details the life of ""Dirt Boy"", a serial killer in a small town.  A young outsider comes into the picture and begins to dig into the murders which are minutely detailed in the book.  He follows in the killer's footsteps and actually finds bodies.  After that the movie sort of goes off the rails.  The plot jumps around too much giving obscure clues and references which don't really make any sense.  There's a lot of ominous music and pained looks from the characters.  It's so bad that it's actually funny at some points.  I wanted to turn it off but I couldn't stop watching sort of like seeing a car crash in slow motion.
