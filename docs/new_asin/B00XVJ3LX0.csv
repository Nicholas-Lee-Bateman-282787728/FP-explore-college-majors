7200258,5,B00XVJ3LX0,"This was a show I just decided to watch randomly and ended up getting hooked pretty quick. Loved it. Only took a few episodes for me to really get into the characters and story, and from there, it just kept getting better. The characters and their powers are the best part, many unusual powers. And Eddie Izzard as the best one of all. Can't beat that. This is also ideal for people who like their superhero stuff dark. Lots of bloodshed. Seriously killer show.",1434931200,18,461,4.5
7200259,5,B00XVJ3LX0,"Aside from the embarrassingly bad superhero effects (especially flying), it's excellent. Phenomenal cast, great story writing (doesn't always go where the tropes suggest), villains and heroes that aren't black and white by any stretch. Very much an R show for language, subject matter, and some gore (usually in the form of a bizarre corpse, some violence...but not for gore's sake. In fact, several scenes you don't see the actual attack, it happens just off camera and you see the side effects. There's a great-white sort of character that makes Wolverine look positively tidy.)

While technically a procedural, it's not a case of the week show...it's a 10 episode one-thing-after-another arc of things spinning out of control. Very impressively plotted out, with several episodes thematically unlike anything else in the show simply because that's where the story went  (one is very much a Aliens style enclosed bughunt, one's a con-job story, etc).

Note that the first few minutes of the first ep have a very ""bad series for 90's direct to syndication"" feel to them. This soon passes and by the end of the first ep, we were hooked.

Been renewed for a second season.",1433808000,33,1171,5.020618556701031

7200303,3,B00XVJ3LX0,"I defenitely recomend watching, its worth it. I gave it three stars for two reasons: one, the special effects are sub-par, and two, they made Walker out to be a broken emotional wreck. Where as in the comic he was more of a dirty hary type, strong and silent, a real boy scout always trying to do the right thing, never really caring about what others think but always trying to make up for his own mistakes. Also they changed Walkers origin story, the one in the comic was so much cooler, i won't go into detail as that would spoil it.",1468022400,2,536,4.264705882352941

7200309,5,B00XVJ3LX0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this show.  I don't have a PlayStation so had to wait until the bluray was released to watch.
Pros:
A compelling story with more complicated characters than the typical archetypes.
Really feels like a graphic novel brought to the screen
Fast paced and a good script.  Better than what you'll see on network TV.
Acting was above average.

Cons:
Not much really.  The special effects could use an upgrade, but still better than a BBC show will have.
The plot and characters aren't all very original.  You can see elements of the Watchmen and Sin City in the characters, writers like Moore, Ellis, and Waid can be seen in the story.

Overall, it was much better than I expected and I can't wait for a second season.",1457222400,2,742,4.583333333333333

7200329,1,B00XVJ3LX0,"I probably shouldn't review this show.  Somebody spent a lot of time, effort (and money I'm sure).  And it just didn't appeal to me.
Nobody's fault, certainly not the cast...which included one of my favorite ladies, Michelle from The Killing.  If I got the name wrong
she was the murdered girls' mom.  I hate being negative, but there it is.",1448150400,2,341,4.633333333333334

7200347,4,B00XVJ3LX0,"I've enjoyed watching this first season episodes. The series reminds me a bit of some novels that I've read. Jay Phillips' 'Kingdom of Heros', the Reckoners series by Brandon Sanderson, and 'Seven Wonders' by Adam Christopher. The idea of real life people with superpowers and the conflicts with those that don't is an interesting storyline. I like that even the heroes aren't perfect people, and neither the villains totally bad.

Good show - look forward to seeing the next season.",1443312000,4,483,5.0375

7200349,4,B00XVJ3LX0,"This program has a really unique slant on the 'superhero' format that so many new TV series are based on.  I find it rather enjoyable, although I don't think Copley is the right guy for the role he plays!  (I think the role he played in ""District 9"" is a much better fit.)",1440806400,,272,4.113207547169812

7200361,4,B00XVJ3LX0,I enjoyed this series. If you read the source material and you are a purist when it comes to translations from one media to another you may be put off by how the writers twisted this one about. I will just mention one glaring point that is not a spoiler in anyway... right from the get go everyone knows the detective used to be Diamond. If you enjoy the differences in peoples takes on thing and you liked the premise of the original comics these are worth a look. Also don't expect to be dazzled by special effects.,1440374400,,517,4.285714285714286
7200362,3,B00XVJ3LX0,"You heard of 'B' movies, well this a 'B' series. The acting is OK, just no big names. A limited budget, as in cheap special effects. And a OK story, as in a little known graphic novel. The series kept me interested enough to keep watching and had a couple of surprises. You have a present day world with some people who have special or super powers. Not all powers are created equal. There are heroes in action and a bunch of unrefined youths with powers, who more or less do their clubbing together. And there is the ""Powers"" department that tries to monitor and control the actions of all these heroes and wannabes. The cinematography gives you the impression of looking through a graphic novel with scenes colorized like a comic cell. The story moves along well, but kind of bogs down in the middle. But it ends with some surprises and the hook to see what happens in season 2. If you were a comic book kid growing up, I'd give this series a look.",1440288000,2,950,4.372881355932203
7200363,4,B00XVJ3LX0,"Not at all the comic really, and the budget seems to not quite cover what they would like to do but still a highly enjoyable series. Best work I've seen from The guy from District 9 and a must for Eddie Izzard fans",1440028800,,214,4.0
7200364,4,B00XVJ3LX0,Great storytelling and it keeps you hooked..... Hope there is a 2nd season,1438387200,,74,4.769230769230769
7200365,2,B00XVJ3LX0,"Yes, based and that is literally it. This show has only a few characters of the same name but completely ZERO context of what made them interesting from the comic book source material. Oh, don't give me that, ""they had to change this and that for the sake of TV, yadday ya."" I understand, but go read the Powers comics (at least to issues 1-35) and you'll understand that this show is terrible and childish in comparison. It's literally on the same level of absurdity much like how Andrea from the Walking Dead comic was changed for the TV version, or how the movies 'Wanted' and 'I Am Legend' completely missed the point of their written sources. This show is so completely away from the source that it's perplexing they are even trying. Deena, Christian, Zora,hell even Retro girl herself are just so diminishing in comparison.
If you are remotely interested in this show because you have to get your superhero/cop fix and have not read any of the acutal comic, go for it! Just watch out for the really REALLY bad special effects. The CW's Arrowverse line up is leagues better than this. If you are a fan of the comic, STAY THE HELL AWAY. It's so hard to watch Powers look so bad!",1438300800,14,1182,4.502325581395349
7200366,5,B00XVJ3LX0,"What if our world was populated by people with super abilities? This is the basic premise of Powers. This series treats the idea of super-powerered people as if they were real. It is a wonderful look at how our world might be if these super-humans existed  and it does it with style and an amazing sense of realism.  Talk about a hidden gem. The cast is amazing. These actors take on their roles and dialogue with the seriousness of a big budget blockbuster. You'll find yourself instantly bonding with the characters, and even though it is based on a comic book series, there is no need to read any of it to still enjoy this masterpiece. If I have to say something bad about Powers, it would be that it clearly has a smaller budget. So there are points where you might feel that you want to see the big high speed, flying, airborne, energy blasting battle up close, but only actually get to see it from a distance. But even with these budget limitations this is still a great show. If you liked the series Heroes, or Alien Nation then get a copy of Powers NOW!!!",1438214400,2,1063,4.3908629441624365
7200367,1,B00XVJ3LX0,"If graphic comic books occupy a part of your life. If escapism fantasy from the dregs of life is your personal savior then Detective Walker (they always have these country stud names) is your newest hero. As usual it's the stereotype of a scruffy looking detective with personal issues. It seems as if the British Bond dapper style has lost its currency. Of course we have the usual partner that's the polar opposite. Mandatory to add enough interpersonal conflict to keep the story rolling until the next shootout. Speaking of shootouts, the very first scene of the very first episode, he did a cop really bad no-no by leaving his then (now dead) partner alone with a much larger and very aggressive nasty looking dude. Subsequently replaced by that newbie partner who also fulfills the series token ethnic and gender diversity quota.

Plot: Fight superbaddies using the basic tools (guns) and hope you get your own superpower back.

Anyway, lots of cheap effects editing to make someone appear then disappear; cheap bloody dead person prosthetics; really bad CGI of Superman (and most every superhero after him) style flying. Dumbed down dialogue (9th grade ed required).
Much better current offerings are, ""Justified"", ""True Detectives"" season one, ""Sherlock"", maybe ""Fargo"", all offer better scripts, sets, acting.

7200368,5,B00XVJ3LX0,"As a fan of Brian Michael Bendis & Michael Avon Oeming's POWERS comic I had high hopes and expectations for Sony PlayStation Network's first original scripted program...and I was not disappointed! While the show isn't perfect right out the gate, each episode is better than the last, and the first season lays down a great foundation for future seasons. From a solid cast to a great script this show is worth watching, not just for fans of the comic. Interesting, intriguing, a little dark, but entertaining. I love that the creators are heavily involved in the production of the series and really looking forward to Season 2.

If you are still unsure the first episode is available for free.",1437609600,,692,4.815126050420168
7200369,3,B00XVJ3LX0,"As a huge fan of the graphic novel, this is definitely VERY loosely based on the original material.  Seriously, there are major fundamental changes.  It's pretty much an Elseworlds version; same names, totally different characters.  Most upsetting, Christian, the main character, is a completely different person; less heroic, less noble.  He's honestly kind of whiny and selfish.

That said, it's still enjoyable; the differences make it unpredictable.  I would have preferred a true adaptation, but this first season was still entertaining.",1437523200,9,542,5.62962962962963
8716746,5,B00XVJ3LX0,"This is an excellent, but sadly overlooked & underappreciated, adult-oriented superhero show. Season 2 didn't even get a Blu-ray release and it was unfortunately canceled before it got a Season 3, but don't assume that has anything to do with the quality of the show, because I personally loved it.

It's a grounded take on superheroes, in a world where superheroes are not just crime fighters, but are also essentially the celebrities of the world, cashing in on their fame. How ordinary people interact with living in a world with powered people is a big focus of the show. But it's not all boring social commentary though; it regularly goes into action thriller, even horror-like, territory and isn't afraid of bloody gory action. Cool stuff.

And despite the grounded realistic nature of the show, at the same time it's not afraid of giving its superpowered people extreeeme powers, making us ask how can you possibly stop these people if they go evil, and that's what I love the most about this show. I love that they really don't feel the need to limit the power levels of the superpowers on the show, just because the show leans more realistic in tone. The show's villains, Johnny Royale & Wolfe for instance, have powers that seem especially unstoppable. How can the good guys even have a chance? Watch and find out!

As for the Blu-Ray, the special features are not bad, if fairly limited. Just a few featurettes. No episode commentaries. There's a fun outtakes reel. But the deleted scenes are probably the highlight of the special features, because there are actually quite a few very interesting deleted scenes.

I got an ultraviolet digital redemption code in my Blu-ray case. Some people overlook those, but I recommend always redeeming those. They're letting you have a digital copy to go along with your purchase, so why not just get it? Mine says it expires 12/31/18, but don't forget that if you can prove that you bought the Blu-ray to a digital distributor, they'll usually let you redeem the digital copy even after the code has expired.",1526947200,,2058,4.8215297450424925
