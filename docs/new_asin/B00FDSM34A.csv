8614514,4,B00FDSM34A,"This is the follow up to `The Woodsman and the rain' and has been seen as a bit on the autobiographic side coming from the book by Shir Maeda. We meet Yonosuke Yokomichi - which is a funny alliteration in Japan. He is starting University in Tokyo hailing as he does from the more provincial Nagasaki. He meets some people and takes up samba dancing.

As well as making friends he does odd jobs and a rich girl falls for him and he has a depressed uncle. This is set in 1987 and the film often skips ahead to 2003 where he is discussed by the various people whose lives he has touched. He seems to be one of those people that always see the positive in life and whilst he can come across as impossibly naive at times he is also well grounded in some aspects of human interaction. This is also a sort of comedy and I did have a few laughs but a lot is cultural so an understanding of Japanese culture will be a massive benefit.

The thing is though this is nearly three hours long and for a story that, of necessity, meanders a fair bit it is hard to stay focussed. I kept thinking the loose ends would come together and they do - on occasion but I did feel a lot was padding. The start especially has some very long scenes with minimum momentum which will be an issue for some viewers, but it is worth bearing with. Do not expect any action either of any sort. This is a slow, coming of age story and the only moral that I could see was that we should always value our friends - especially those that we might think are a bit different as they may the most precious.",1398124800,,1565,4.127868852459017
