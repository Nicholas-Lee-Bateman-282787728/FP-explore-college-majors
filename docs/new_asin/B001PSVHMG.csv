8334631,2,B001PSVHMG,"Where to start? Ok, there's the veteran mezzo Rosalind Elias as the Old Lady who literally steals the show. She sounds darn good for her age and knows how to project both voice and character. The Candide and Cunegonde are attractive physically and sing beautifully (especially the Candide), but act their roles poorly. Neither displays the requisite innocence. The Candide is defeated by an unnecessary wig. Robert Orth as the narrator/Pangloss etc. simply does not have fun with the part. He's a decent actor, but he misses the satire, playing it straight or ridiculously hamming it up. The Paquette who is supposed to be sexually alluring is nothing of the sort and miscast. The rest of the cast are Europeans who try hard, but don't have the English language in their blood and just can't deliver the drama or comedy. John DeMain's tempi are slow and the orchestra has quite a few flubbed notes. The chorus is inadequate and unintelligible. Except for Ms. Elias, it's amateur night.

The worst offense is the direction and production. The overture is danced by a small ensemble not in the period clothing of the rest of the production. I have no objection to staging the overture, but the dance has absolutely NOTHING to do with the rest of the show. The dancers are brought back throughout the operetta and are a terrible distraction. The stage direction lacks movement, humor, and that scintillating quality necessary for comic operetta. It simply lacks any cleverness. The director depends on a revolving turntable which is never used to any comic effect. The costumes aren't bad, but the wigs are pretty distracting. The piece has so much biting humor which is simply not delivered. The audience sounds bored with the whole enterprise.

The production uses Bernstein's Final Revised version. It has more of the score, but I much prefer the Hugh Wheeler book for the Opera House version produced for the NYC Opera which is full of fun and is engaging; Bernstein, John Mauceri and others simple played with the piece too much in the revised version. It works in concert form, but in the theater it pales with the Harold Prince concept for City Opera.

I join other reviewers here wondering why a DVD company would release this performance?",1505433600,,2244,4.884514435695538
8334632,5,B001PSVHMG,"This is the only one DVD of the Candide stage production, as most others are not really the recording of full stage production. Some of them are concert style, some of them are half concert style. Music of this DVD is not the best, but think about the rarity. Bernstein must have wanted a stage production which he himself could not produce as an opera.  ( Yes, Broadway musical productions were very nice and I myself enjoyed a broadway production in early 70's. But they are not the final form the composer wanted. ) T.K.OHSKA",1468108800,,528,4.557894736842106
8334633,5,B001PSVHMG,"This has become my favorite Candide. It is one of the very few that features a full stage production with acting, dialogue, costumes, sets, and the glorious music.  It was filmed at the Teatro Argentina in Rome in 2003 with Michael Slattery as Candide, Nancy Allen Lundy as Cunegonde, and Robert Orth as Voltaire / Pangloss. and Rosalind Elias as the Old Woman -- each giving strong performances.  For those who want both the operatic music and the comedy/drama in full, this is the only production currently available on dvd that gives both.  Michael Slattery and Nancy Allen Lundy do a brilliant job of portraying human characters, singing their hearts out, without sacrificing the comedy or stepping out of the flow of all that is Candide -- the mad pastiche that throws everything into the pot, musical and otherwise.

Having recently seen (more than once) what to me was a near-perfect production of Candide on stage at the Glimmerglass Festival, it is hard for me to settle for any of the concert versions. Each of them has much to offer. Bernstein's concert in London has, of course, Bernstein himself, a full orchestra and chorus, and the wonderful performances by Jerry Hadley, June Anderson, and Christa Ludwig.  In the Broadway versions, Kristin Chenoweth's Cunegonde is nothing short of brilliant, as well as immensely entertaining.

But no matter how beautiful or dazzling the parts are in the concert versions, no matter how colorful the characterizations, they just are not the same as having the whole acted out on stage.  On the surface, the plot of Candide is thin, but it creates its own kind of world, through which Candide travels in search of Cunegonde,  Only on stage can we fully enter that world rather than  just sketch it out in our minds with snippets of narrative to link the songs together.

In short, I think Candide is meant to be theater, and the Rome production delivers that.  Michael Slattery and Nancy Allen Lundy carry the show beautifully. They are funny, endearing, and delightful and, at the same time, bring out the emotions underlying the music and believably bring the story to its powerful conclusion, letting the music define the action.  As mentioned by another reviewer, some of the supporting cast are not as strong as the principals, but it all works well enough.

There are, however, a few noticeable flaws. Yes, the dancers in the silver space suits are silly, at best, though not as bad as I thought they might be after reading the reviews here.  After my first viewing, I simply ignored them.

Some reviewers have mentioned the sound.  There is a problem, especially towards the beginning, with some of the indvidual voices not being suffiently amplified, especially as compared to the orchestra, but turning up the volume improved the situation to the point that it was not distracting or particularly troublesome.  And at some point, it sounded fine to me without having to adjust anything. The visual quality of the dvd, however, is excellent. It looks great in HD.  So despite whatever problem they had with the audio engineering, visually it's crisp and clear and professional.looking.
.
Bottomline, I think this is the best Candide currently available on dvd if one wants to see what a staged version looks like. Michael Slattery and Nancy Allen Lundy also have great voices, and their singing and acting are what made me give this five stars.",1440374400,,3403,4.898954703832753
8334634,1,B001PSVHMG,"""Candide"", which is one of my favorite Bernstein scores, (after West Side Story) has not been served well on video, and this production, shoveled onto the market by Kultur Video, is the worst of the bunch.  Poor sound, non-existent sets, amateurish performances by all involved, and misguided direction choices mar this one beyond redemption.  The pit orchestra is woefully inadequate, with missed notes, out-of-tune playing, and leaden tempos matching point for point the humorless, flat stagecraft.  The overture is a sad portent of what's to come: a confusing ""ballet"" in which several dancers prance in a baffling accompaniment to Bernstein's brilliant 'Overture', which is massacred by the sub-standard playing of the orchestra.  The actors are uniformly dull, with only Pangloss making an impression, but even he is shrill and brittle in his character.  The audience seems to be as bored as the actors, with weak, smattering applause the performers only reward.  Why Kultur would decide to produce and sell such a weak product is beyond me - there's nothing here to warrant general release.",1367020800,5,1096,5.2701149425287355
8334635,3,B001PSVHMG,"After studying the Voltaire book in Honors English 11, I wanted my high school students to see a performance of the Bernstein light opera.  Since it is unlikely they will have the opportunity to see a live performance, I opted for the more complete, theatrical performance DVD over the concert versions with better sound quality.
  I wasn't too bothered by the poor sound on this DVD, which had been mentioned in other reviews of this particular version of Candide; however, enabling the subtitles feature of the DVD helped us all understand the lyrics and dialogue better, which was worthwhile.  I have long loved much of the music in this opera, and it was a pleasure to hear it again.
  Some features of the staging were just plain weird, particularly the silver-clad dancers.  Both the students and I found those portions distracting.  My students laughed more than I wished they had while watching it--not always at the parts intended to be humorous--but I attribute that in part to some of the staging choices.
  It was still worth showing the DVD in class.  I'll always be swept away by the finale and think about what it means to grow into a maturer view of love and life.",1332201600,3,1180,4.7073170731707314
8334636,2,B001PSVHMG,"Loaded with bum notes!  A poorly choreographed piece that accompanies one of the greatest Overtures the theater has ever known??? Why on earth would they want to stage that??
And then the orchestra is often dire..  That famous overture is leaden and I heard trumpet split-notes! This is an abomination!  Performers are only adequate and the staging is skimpy to threadbare.  Stick with Hal Prince's 1986 New York City Opera version or even the recent concert. This is so cheap and lousy that if Bernstein were still alive- this would kill him.",1247616000,3,543,4.869565217391305
8334637,2,B001PSVHMG,"I was so looking forward to seeing this production of CANDIDE since it's conducted by the great John deMain. Also the production looks good on paper, but it's not very good in performance. The sound is poor, and  the chorus sounds as if it's singing in another room and the production doesn't move swiftly enough: CANDIDE is a bawdy farce with serious movements that needs to move like the wind since it's essentially a one-joke show: innocent babes who've taught the world is the best of all possible worlds are repeatedly raped, beaten, cheated, robbed and worse until they finally wise up.

You know you're in trouble when the choreographer decides to choreograph the greatest overture ever written for Broadway, and you're stuck watching six dancers in silver body suits prance around aimlessly while the principal trumpet blows notes left and right. The orchestra is very secondrate. Some of of the secondary cast, as well as the chorus, is Italian, so some of the of the wonderful lyrics are difficult to understand. The design, overall, is quite good, mid-eighteenth century, as is Voltaire's novella, but the pace is slow and the choreography and musical staging very poor.

Then we get to the fantastic finale ""Make Our Garden Grow"" and the trumpeter blows the final notes! Final gripe? The credits list the singers but don't tell who played what roles. Pathetic.

I still prefer the Bernstein performance with Jerry Hadley, June Anderson, and Christa Ludwig. Bernstein's pace is much slower than Samuel Krachmalnik who conducted the original 1956 performances, but his discussion about the show's development is fantastic and illuminating. Still, you want to yell at the screen ""It's a comic operetta! Move it."" Anything, even this, is preferable to the dreadful Lonny Price campfest from the Philharmonic. It may be funny but it's completely lacking in style and wit besides being a lousy rendition of a great score.",1246665600,14,1927,5.050314465408805
8334638,1,B001PSVHMG,This production is seriously lacking something. Candide is a silly silly show anyway. The one with Kristin Chenaweth is awesome.,1240531200,,128,5.45
8334639,4,B001PSVHMG,"It's a most beatiful production, quite complete as far as I know, with some music pieces not included in the 1974 recording. Voices and acting are very good and the staging is excelent.
However, it has sound problems: it played too low in my TV and there was some noise behind. Besides, the orchestra sounds a bit lazy in many instances, without the energy and punch of previous sound recordings I've had the chance to listen to. Anyhow, as this is the only fully recorded staged production, I would highly recommend it, specially for those who haven't seen a live presentation: it will give them the chance to see it complete and fully staged.",1239840000,14,644,4.657894736842105
8334640,3,B001PSVHMG,"First, the good part: this is the only fully staged performance of this work on DVD, and I heard more of the music in this performance than in any other (although without a score, I can't say with certainty that it is complete). Unfortunately, in all other respects, this is the weakest of the three performances currently available on DVD. The orchestra is second-rate, and, although the singers are (for the most part) vocally adequate, there is an air of insecurity (especially in part I) as though there had not been sufficient rehearsal. In addition, there were technical problems with the sound recording. At the beginning, the singers sound as though they were too far from the microphones, and the sound level from the stage is distractingly erratic thereafter. The other two available performances are stronger; the semi-staged one with Lupone and Chenowith (sp?), whose Cunegonde is the best I've seen or heard, is the most fun of all.",1239235200,17,945,4.949685534591195
