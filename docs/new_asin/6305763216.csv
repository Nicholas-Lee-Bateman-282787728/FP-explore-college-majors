7894157,3,6305763216,"Depending on where you get your information from, ""Born to Defense"" is either Jet Li's seventh or third film, but in either case, it's impressive that it would be Li's directorial debut so early in his movie career. He doesn't do a bad job of things, all things considered, so it's a bit surprising that he hasn't directed since. With that said, the film seems to hit & miss with audiences, and I can see why: aside from being uncharacteristically gritty for a Li picture of its time, its one-sided examination of post-war race relations between Chinese and Americans is sure to alienate some viewers.

The story: Jet Yong (Li,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B004SIP88Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>) returns home after defending his country from Japanese aggressors, only to find the town overrun by rowdy and violent American sailors. Refusing to lay down to their bullying, he defies the blind eye of authorities and takes them on in a fight for honor.

Hong Kong cinema is so different from Hollywood fare that I can't justly compare Li's freshman effort with those of other action-heroes-turned-directors, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steven-Seagal/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steven Seagal</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/0783226748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>, but I can say that I didn't notice any technical snafus in the movie. The opening scene wherein Jet's legion fights off Japanese tanks felt sort of awkwardly staged, although this might simply be a matter of me not being used to seeing Li in any war-related scenes. Technically or aesthetically, the film doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary, but it doesn't need to. With nothing but the fight scenes to distract us (more on those in a moment), we're left to focus on the story, which really goes out of its way to promote Chinese nationalism through western racism. I'm not a WWII expert and I know the movie isn't meant to be taken factually, but the actions of the American antagonists are overblown even by the gweilo standards of Hong Kong. It's not nearly realistic enough to make you feel ashamed of being American, but it makes you wonder whether Dimension Home Video was ever really meant to pick up this one for the US-released Jet Li Collection series.

Of course, if they were going just by the action scenes, it's a little more understandable, since these are pretty unique by Li's standards. Jet is one of the best guys when it comes to fighting on wires and doing acrobatic brawls, but the dude is no slouch when it comes to supplying more grounded encounters. They're not entirely realistic, especially when it comes to portraying just how much damage a 5'6"", 130-pound man can absorb, but boy are they fun to watch. Li has two worthy opponents in Paolo Tocha (the cocky muay thai fighter from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>) and the Swedish giant Kurt Petersson (""Bruce Lee's Dragons Fight Back""), and the kung fu vs. boxing choreography is pretty fluid between them. Surprisingly, there are only four real fights to be seen, but it doesn't matter much since the Li-Petersson brawls are surprisingly long - I think their initial ring fight reaches the six-minute mark.

The ending is shockingly bitter, featuring a triple murder (two by the Americans, one by Jet) and no real resolution - just a minor moral high ground for the protagonist, who ended up getting beaten up so badly that he (Li) hardly looks like himself anymore at the end of the final showdown. At this point in the movie, you may have been expecting something similar, but again, it's far from typical Jet Li fare. For fans, it's definitely worth checking out if only for comparison or novelty's sake, but casual viewers will almost definitely prefer his more typical output.",1339113600,3,4076,5.590614886731392
7894158,2,6305763216,"Jet Li is an incredible martial artist, not director. This movie shows that truism clearly. The first action sequence is decent enough with Jet scrambling to stay out of the way of tanks and other war time materials, but after that no fight scene is worth the time. Badly shot and poorly lit film, unfortunately. ...",998784000,3,316,4.660714285714286
7894159,5,6305763216,"I know a lot of others think this movie stinks b/c it has a horrible story line and it's a dark movie and there is not fantasy to it... but what I LOVE about it is that they do some pretty funky fighting.  Jet Li actually does some serious funky fighting in this movie.  There is a lot of rage, anger, and bitterness that comes out of this movie.  I personally like the last fight scene.  It's got a lot of boxing/kick boxing style fighting in it from the Navy guys and Jet Li doesn't get to fly around and do much of his 'wire works'(using wires to fly around on).  But the best thing about this movie is that they don't make him look like an invincible guy(like they usually do)... and he actually get's beat up pretty bad. I like it myself though, It's not a bad movie. You should buy it if you are a Jet Li fan.",992736000,4,815,4.037267080745342
7894160,1,6305763216,"In post-WWII China returning Chinese soldiers are met by overbearing American G.I.'s.  One of the local soldiers (Jet Li) runs into trouble with  an American captain.  Fans of Jet Li's 'Once Upon a Time in China'and 'Fong  Sai Yuk' series should be aware that this movie contains no ""wire  fu"".  Fights between Li and Kurt Roland Pettersson (European Boxing  Champion) and Paulo H.P. Tocha (kick boxing Champion), which would have  been entertaining are unfortunately marred by poor lighting and become hard  to follow.  I would have liked to see Li's wushu pitted against  conventional boxing and kick boxing but the scenes are so dark that the  images become blurs.  New fans of Jet Li's recent movies and the fight  scenes in 'The Matrix' should try the above 2 series as well as 'Shaolin  Temple'and Donnie Yan's 'Iron Monkey'.",966211200,,831,4.920289855072464
