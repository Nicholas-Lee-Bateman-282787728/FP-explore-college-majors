I personally don't have a problem with hot guys with their shirts off alongside drag queens Trannies &/or fag hags! Not all are of the 'highest' budget, but so what, that adds to the campiness of it. Some can be passed by (after a viewing or two), as is the case with all dvds of this nature. We need more stuff like this. None of it is sad. Everyone dies! It's great to see these artists living or dead. It's worth it just to see how big Pete Burn's lips have gotten! Gawd love'em...",1210032000,2,560,4.2924528301886795
8069359,2,B0009XBR2I,"On the one hand, this was a historical and diverse look at drag in video over the past few decades.  On the other hand, this is some cheesy disc that one can see, but not hear, in any noisy gay male bar.  The music consists of watered-down house and predictable techno.  Fans of the film ""Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"" and the compact disc ""Dancing Queen"" may really like this DVD.

This is not drag-exclusive: there where hunky male torsos in almost every video.  I do worry that this falls into Esther Newton's idea that gay men must either have hot bodies or be witty and do drag.  It was a type of male butch-femme that doesn't recognize the diversity of gender expression among gay men.

The videos showed men caressing women and gender-conforming men caressing drag queens, but no gender-conforming guys caressing each other.  A journalist once said, ""The world is like Will & Grace when it comes to gay men: ask, tell, but don't see.""  There's still a way in which man-to-man action is ""the love that dare not speak its name.""  It's sad to see this being the case in the 21st century.

The best video came from Dana International.  I first heard about her in the gay studies anthology ""Speaking in Queer Tongues.""  She got realness!  You'd never know she was born male, but then again, the clothes around her equator were not revealing.  The message of freedom and the Middle Eastern-accented music was touching.  She must be a star!

Finally, this film may make some people sad.  Many of the performers here have passed away (Divine, one of the Weather Girls, the Leather Man from the Village People).  This disc hints at the lost era of the 1970s.",1132963200,3,1658,4.597269624573379
