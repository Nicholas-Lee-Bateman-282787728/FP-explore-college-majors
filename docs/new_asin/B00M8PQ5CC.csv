8670784,3,B00M8PQ5CC,"Well; this purchase was to have a joint recording by the two main performers and former couple.
Schrott is too 'giovanistic'; the setting is too modern.
Contemporary 'mises-en-scne' disregard that opera is a 'totality' art. The music leads, but it is not all.
In fact, without a libretto, opera is just music, without any concrete meaning what, Don Giovanni in particular, certainly has.
Without a proper setting, that meaning is degraded or misleading.
So, this version is only worth the singing of some of the performers,NOT the opera as a whole.
(I have another 10 versions of it; all are superior). A CD would be enough.",1447372800,,624,4.89622641509434

8670787,4,B00M8PQ5CC,"This is a 21 Century Don Gionanni.  Not in a bad Regie Theater way, but with the costumes, trappings (Leporello uses his cell phone to add photos to the catalog) and a psychological outlook that everyone is flawed.  No good guys versus bad guys here.
Schrott is an absolutely amazing Don Giovanni.  His false smiles and psychotic tics play well with his natural playboy good looks, and he is in great voice making this a 5 star performance.  Anna Netrebko  as Anna is also a natural  wonder and her presence fills the stage.  At the time of this performance they were life partners and together projected an electrifying dynamism here.
Pisaroni and Ernman sing very well and ham it up in interesting ways.
The loss of one star is for the lack of drama in the final descent to hell scene, and especially for the  set-- 5 shades of grey.  The  orchestra supported the voices fine, but sounded dull on its own.
NOTE:  The Blu-Ray disk is world wide zone 0 as you can read if the fine print on the back photo of the case.  It is not zone 2b as stated in the listed description.",1417305600,10,1073,4.3908629441624365
