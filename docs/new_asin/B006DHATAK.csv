4983977,5,B006DHATAK,"I purchased the film ""Zarak"", released as a dvd-r by Columbia Classics made on demand program (a Sony subsidiary,SPE)on 1/3/12.  I received the disc on 1/12/12.  By my standards the Columbia Classics MOD of ""Zarak"" has, like the other Columbia Classics I have purchased,extraordinarily good picture and sound.  I have previously bought ""The Spiriualist"" aka ""The Amazing Mr. X"" (from the 40's) and ""The Long Haul"" (from the 50's) from this Columbia program and been shocked by how good both discs looked and sounded.  ""Zarak"" again, exceeded my expectations.  I have no idea if my view of what makes for an excellent presentation is warped or if the previous reviewer is dealing with the title from a different source (not SPE) but I certainly disagree with him.  The artwork presented for this disc on the Amazon site is the same on my copy.  The Columbia logo appears as always and the film IS widescreen.  The merits of the film could be debated but, from my perspective, the quality of the dvd presentation is as good as you will get from any film made in 1956.  If you are familiar with ""Zarak"" and like the film, I do not think you will be disappointed by this dvd-r.

I should note that I have been taken to task for praising dvd-rs in other reviews.  Dvd-rs do not last as long as ""pressed"" discs.  I have bought a copy of the ""pressed"" disc of ""The Amazing Mr. X"" and then, on the recommendation of other Amazon reviewers, purchased the title as a dvd-r from the Columbia Classic MOD (SPE) for a lot more money ($20).  The superiority of the source material used for the dvd-r, for me, made it worth more dough and frankly, I am old and will probably expire before my dvd-rs do.  I use an OPPO 83 blu-ray player and a 46"" UN468500 Samsung 1080p lcd television to view this and all other dvds and dvd-rs.  However, I do not feel equipment could possibly account for the disparity of opinion between my review of the picture and sound of this product and astroboi's view.  I guess your best bet will be to wait for others to give you an idea about this disc's quality before you make a purchase.",1326499200,19,2102,4.506596306068602
4983978,2,B006DHATAK,"The dvd I saw seems to be authored from an old master for a laserdisc or maybe even a VHS tape!  It starts out in full scope ratio (although not anamorphic) but when the titles end, back to 1.33 pan and scan we go!  Additionally, the Columbia pictures logo is missing. Amazon doesn't mention what the aspect ratio is supposed to be so you kind of assume it will be the native ratio for the film. Especially when the cover art screames ""CINEMASCOPE!!!!"" in letters as big as the stars names.  The big attraction here, aside from Ms. Eckberg, is a big screen experience with lots of battle scenes which you will see squeezed and cropped. No excuse for this sort of thing these days. It's not 1980 anymore.",1326153600,4,703,4.434108527131783
4983979,3,B006DHATAK,"19th century North West Passage story of conflict between English Intruders and local Afghan Tribes. All male gung ho adventure stuff, fortunately given relief by the stunning presence of Anita Ekberg as a possibly ""Circassian Princess"" which may or may not explain her uncovered presence in an Islamic country. Such was Hollywood's imagination at the expense of historical accuracy at the time.",1394064000,3,395,5.387096774193548
4983980,4,B006DHATAK,"If that alone isn't worth the price of admission for You. This movie may not be your cup of tea. It is weak on story, character development, consistency, plot, humor, good old fashioned cheese, or much else of redeeming, or entertainment value. But seeing the lovely Miss Ekberg dancing is not just the highlight of this film... But in my opinion, what You should buy it for. These exceptional sequences are a rare and wonderful bit of film history and subtle vintage erotica. I hope this brief and strange blurb was helpful.",1387670400,2,525,4.717391304347826

4983982,3,B006DHATAK,"I TRIED LIKE HECK TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE FROM SEVERAL ON-LINE RETAILERS WITHOUT SUCCESS, BEFORE FINALLY TURNING TO GOOGLE, AND ACHIEVING SAME. I'VE SEEN ANOTHER VICTOR MATURE MOVIE MADE AROUND THE SAME TIME, ""THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE"", SEVERAL TIMES; BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY NEVER PLAYED ""ZARAK"" ON TV. I WANTED IT NOT FOR THE MOVIE, BUT BECAUSE OF ANITA EKBERG. I STILL HAVE A VIVID IMAGE IN MY MIND SEEING IT IN THE MOVIE, & THE POSTER IN THE LOBBY WITH ANITA LYING ON HER SIDE, & THE TAG LINE ABOUT VICTOR MATURE ""CLIMBING OVER THE SLOPES OF MT. EKBERG""; OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR. WHEN THE DVD FINALLY CAME, I COULDN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT. TO MY SURPRISE & DISAPPOINTMENT, IT DIDN'T HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECT ON ME DECADES LATER. SHE DIDN'T SEEM NEARLY AS DELECTIBLE AS SHE DID WHEN I SAW HER ON THE BIG SCREEN AS A YOUNGSTER. IT WAS SORT OF LIKE ""THE WOLFMAN"" AND ""FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN"". MY AUNT TOOK ME TO SEE ""WOLFMAN"" WHEN I WAS A CHILD, & IT TERRIFIED ME SO MUCH I HAD TO KEEP THE LIGHT ON IN MY BEDROOM FOR AT LEAST A MONTH AFTERWARD. IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN. NOW WHEN I SEE IT ON TV, I WONDER WHAT THE BIG DEAL WAS. WHEN I WENT TO SEE ""FRANKIE MEETS WOLFIE"" AT A NEIGHBORHOOD THEATER IN HARLEM, N.Y., THE FIRST TIME FRANKENSTEIN CAME ON THE SCREEN, I LITERALLY RAN OUT OF THE THEATER WITH MY YOUNGER BROTHERS TRAILING BEHIND ME, & DIDNT STOP RUNNING UNTIL I GOT HOME & LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND ME. NOW WHEN I SEE IT, HO HUM.",1355097600,,1463,4.228571428571429
4983983,5,B006DHATAK,"i think this is a very good movie with a very good cast of actors in it it was also packed securely
and delivered before the due date there is a good story behind this movie  thanks",1353283200,,181,3.891891891891892
4983984,4,B006DHATAK,Unlike some of the reviews--my copy was very good.  I found it to be an enjoyable escape--and how could an escape with Anita Ekberg not be a good thing?,1343260800,2,152,4.241379310344827
4983985,5,B006DHATAK,"This a review of the disc, not the movie (one of my favorites from when I was a kid.)  I ordered this on Amazon, along with Storm Over The Nile, through other sellers, New, from ImportCDs. I watched this on my Blu-ray player and the sharpness of the picture is as good as a Blu-ray.  The movie is in its original widescreen aspect 2.35:1 - Not, 1.33:1 as shown in product details.  Now to the movie.  As I said this was one of my favorites when I was 15.  Some reviewers thought it was miscast, but for a movie from the 50's it was perfect.  Mature was in quite a few sword & sandal, swashbucklers and was always good for the parts.  Who would you expect to play Zarak - Cary Grant?  'nuff said.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this one.",1341187200,10,743,4.13986013986014
4983986,5,B006DHATAK,"I waited many years for this movie in DVD. It was a favorite from childhood. I was very excited and watched it 4 times in 4 weeks. Quick summary: Made in 1956. Set in the Northwest frontier near the Afgan border. Directed by award winner Terrance Young (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, Wait Until Dark, Valachi papers, etc), Terrific sweeping battle scenes, hundreds of extras playing live British soldiers and Afgan tribesman. Outstanding musical score, location director and stunts by the famous Yakima Canutt (greatest stuntman of all-time). Producer Albert (Cubby) Broccoli (James Bond Movie fame. Also was an early movie for Patrick McGoohan (British Commander)
Zarak played by Victor Mature was a local outlaw who hated the British but betrayed both sides (British and his tribeman and brothers) several times. At the end he does the greatest heroic thing a man can do. He gave his life to save the enemy!!!! The DVD was very crisp and clear in Technicolor and I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action/adventure and late 1800's British Empire in this area of the world!",1339804800,3,1098,4.940540540540541
4983987,5,B006DHATAK,"Not for the first time, I am really confused over the reviews on the Amazon site. I have to absolutely agree with GL and John Amies. My copy from Columbia Classics/Sony is truly excellent. Wonderful full Scope, vibrant colour, picture and sound. One of the best prints I've seen. So, whilst I can understand Astrobi's anger at getting such a bad copy, can it really be from the same source? It really is a worry as comments attached to his review make plain that it's hard to make one's mind up, particularly as these DVDs aren't cheap. Well, I took a chance and I'm glad I did, but there are other conflicting reports out there for othetr films, so I suppose we'll never get it 100%. As for ZARAK itself - seldom have I seen such a daft film. Almost totally miscast from Mature as Zarak Khan, Ekberg as, well I'm not sure, Wilding with his grey toupee cast as a fist fightin' army commander, to Bernard Miles, Eddie Byrne, and Bonar Colleano as Indian bandits. The plot gets a bit confusing too, who is doing what to whom, but that could just be me. Ekberg has seldom looked better, and her dances are, for the time, very sexy. Yakima Canutt does the stunts, and much of the big battle scenes turn up as stock footage in Brigand of Khandahar with Oliver Reed. I enjoyed every darn, crazy minute of it!! It is a must for oldies like me (and some younger ones) who like a good old fashioned adventure with mucho macho violence (for the time) and a hint of sex. Bring on ""The Bandit Of Zhobe""! Highly recomended",1328313600,25,1509,4.392857142857143
4983988,5,B006DHATAK,"After ordering this movie i read a criticism of the dvd quality ,format, etc,so when it arrived i put it in my dvd player with some trepidation. My fears were groundless,this columbia,sony pictures presentation is perfect. Widescreen ,vibrant colour and excellent audio.the film itself is a great colourful boys own adventure not to be taken too seriously,i mean victor mature as an indian,and anita ekberg as his fathers wife with whom he falls in love!!Anitas' weirdest casting since she played a chinese peasant girl john waynes' Blood Alley!
Columbia /sony have released some really good quality classic adventure movies recently and the ones i have bought;Edge of Eternity,Odongo,Beyond Mombasa,and Storm Over the Nile have all been excellent.",1327968000,17,748,5.401709401709402

8496725,5,B006DHATAK,"Okay right of the bat today's cgi cartoons can't hold a computer candle to vintage films of lore. Zarak is the best release yet in the sword and sandal
Genre. Victor mature is at his hammish best as the title character Zarak a banished outlaw and when he's not fighting off British colonial troops, hes romancing the lovely Anita Ekberg (who's quite the exotic dancer) this is a great production some of the more better grand scale fights than in most
Columbia definitely dug up a great print clear, full of color and correct in its scope. No extras but the DVD does start itself and stays on a loop.",1471046400,,600,4.463636363636364
8496726,4,B006DHATAK,"Billy Idol's song ""Flesh for Fantasy"" captures the appeal of Fifties blonde bombshell Anita Ekberg. She does not disappoint anyone with a pulse. Forties film noir icon Victor Mature(""Cry of the City"", ""I Wake up Screaming"") also made another film with Anita Ekberg ""Pickup Alley""(1957). Applying for membership at a San Diego country club skeptical about film stars, Victor Mature told them, ""I'm no actor and I have 50 films to Prove it.""",1443571200,2,439,5.027397260273973
8496727,4,B006DHATAK,"It was a pleasure to watch this movie in HD. Manly Victor Mature and alluring Anita Ekberg showed great chemistry. Setting in Afghanistan made a big change from the usual setting of the Western world. Zarak, the son of an Afghan chief, was banished from the town because of his love for his father's youngest bride/concubine, who wanted to escape from the wretched life she was living. He turned into a warrior/freedom fighter against the British rule. The shooting of war scenes are great. So was the strategy of the Afghan forces in outsmarting the brutal British.
The story has faults though. The character of Zarak's altruism towards foreign women doesn't reflect in the known Afghan invasions and massacres of the surrounding of the countries, as known by the medieval history.
The ending felt ridiculous. Anita Ekberg has two dances, resembling belly dances, worth watching.
If you've difficulty selecting the movie, this one will not bore you.",1439596800,2,950,5.057324840764331
8496728,4,B006DHATAK,"Good entertainment, and good action film from the '50s, with masterly horse-riding scenes.  Anita Ekberg sizzles.  Wish this picture would be re-mastered in 5.1 stereo surround D.V.D. though.",1434067200,2,191,5.785714285714286

8496730,5,B006DHATAK,This is a classic that you have to watch to appreciate.,1406505600,,55,4.090909090909091
8496731,3,B006DHATAK,"I think in the 50's it was a good movie and Victor Mature was a famous leading actor in many good Hollywood films.
I did buy this DVD ""Zarak' because Anita Ekberg is the star in it, and after that Fellini made with her ""La douce vita"" and it was a international success. It wa the big movie to change the mind of the mew generation of thr 60's.
but ' for me ""Zarak"" now this is just another classic movie as stardust from the past.",1395619200,,431,4.023255813953488
