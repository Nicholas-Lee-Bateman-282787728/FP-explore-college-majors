7413907,5,B014K32G8Q,"If you love the original, then this is just such a great labor of love. There's a sincerity and desire to revere what came before. They don't go for a cheap recreation or remake of the original. Rather they jump off of the elements that gave the original its cult following and deliver something new and fresh. A new ""bad"" that is unexpectedly touching. The original is a film I have enjoyed for so long, and I am gratefull that they were able to deliver something just as odd and  different that acknowledges the original. I love the return of so many of the actors from the original, even if they are just cameos. Its heartwarming to see a labor of love where the people involved with the original can come back and do their best to recreate what made the original special.",1452988800,2,775,4.419580419580419

7413910,4,B014K32G8Q,"Went and watched a midnight showing last night at the Belcourt in Nashville, TN. I watched part 1 right before going so I knew what I was getting in to, and i was a little worried because the original was so bad (in both bad and good ways lol) I was glad to see so many of the original cast in this movie, made it feel more authentic! It was much in the same vein as the original with plenty of homages to it. It was hilarious (played perfectly with me and my brother's sense of humor) and there was about 30 people in the theater with us, all laughing at the same parts. Plenty of nudity (warning contains tits!) to make it feel early 90's.

My issues are I have no idea what was going on, there were way too many characters, and the ""Samurai Cop"" rarely used a sword and never used a gun. It seemed to be set in the future at some points and then it seemed like 2015 in others. The main actor Hannon had this crazy look on his face at all times, I think it was his eyes they were either completely shut or wide open, there was no in between. The ending and the point of the story was completely unclear and the CG blood was just ridiculous.

All in all though it was worth the ticket, it was fun. That's all the movie was for is fun anyways and they left it open for a part 3, i look forward to it if it happens :)",1449360000,10,1316,3.9622641509433962

7413914,1,B014K32G8Q,"Do you like watching porn stars struggle through dialog? Do you want to waste an evening trying to follow a garbage script? Do you want to have the sinking feeling a director included a bunch of female breasts just to sell DVDs?

The sad part is, the original stars of Samurai Cop really try. They take their roles as seriously as they can, clearly trying to prove they have real chops. You just have to hope you can hear them over obnoxiously loud and out of place music, or to be able to see their acting through terrible lighting and awful camerawork. Even the makeup is garbage. Simple concepts like powdering an actor's face to reduce glare are apparently out of this filmmaker's comfort zone.

Only worth it if you fast forward through the stupid parts to watch the original stars eating up the screen. Matt Hannon, the Samurai Cop, turns in the sort of performance any amateur actor would love to have on tape. It's the definition of a guy taking a bad role to get his face on screen, and if the whole movie was like that, it would be good. But it's not.

Try to have some friends around and try not to roll your eyes too hard when you see an extra yawning in the background becuase of how boring it was on set. Sigh at plastic props. Try not to turn the film off then you notice the director added fake smoke in post so it doesn't even move with the camera, it looks like you're watching a smoke machine blowing over a movie screen. What a disaster, and not in a fun way. It's just a stupid cash grab. Skip it.",1487980800,3,1518,4.2822299651567945

Once that expectation is in place there is a lot in this movie that's really, really funny, and it's obvious that everyone had a good time making it.

There are a few parts that make me cringe in a BAD way though, like the actresses who haven't aged well at all, and the terrible, awful blood effects (once or twice would be funny, constantly just ruins the joke).
Things like that.
Plus the movie is slightly too self-aware to get away with some of the more nonsensical plot points.

I love a solid bad movie, but this is a badly made movie, and those are different things.  Unless you want to scream ""why"" at your television, avoid this movie.

Positives: Tommy W. Giving a classical acting class on digital film, Karedas screaming ""NO!"" And flaring his eyes like Gawron, the partner actually being a pretty good actor, everyone yelling constantly without reason or cause, some fairly good action choreography, and a pretty decent soundtrack.

Negatives: there was clearly no script, basically no one can act and it's not funny, there are only two jokes that actually work, unnecessary stunt casting all the time, no reason for anyone to do anything, constant, terrible, pretend Japanese that becomes nothing short of racism,",1473552000,,857,4.965034965034965

The main character of Joe looks like a cross between Weird Al and Iggy Pop. They say that it's impossible for older actress to find work, not in this film. They are the majority of the cast.

The filmmakers took what they thought made the original one good and tried to just copy that. The old one felt like it was made by people who were passionate about making a movie. This one is full of bad digital effects and even worse action scenes. If you like Samurai Cop and want to keep that memory untainted then don't watch this one. It's like they realized that the first one was funny in the way that The Room is funny and they went out of their way to recreate those parts. Also they put Tommy Wiseau is in this movie.

I never saw such a badly done movie that I had to own. I don't know what happened with the sequel though. It has Joe and Frank and the magic from the first is gone. Joe aged badly and he is scary to look at now and on top of that he is someone that you just get bored quickly watching. The first movie was just all cop movie with Joe and Frank in all their epic badness. This one is a cluster mess of aliens,very weird characters all with a science fiction back drop. It was only right at the end of this movie where Joe says a few of his lines from the first movie that made me say now that's the Joe I wanna see.

7413945,5,B014K32G8Q,"American cinema has a number of defining films in its history from timeless classics like Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, Maltese Falcon and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes to more contemporary examples like Glory, The Shawshank Redemption, No Country for Old Men and 12 Years a Slave.  The original Samurai Cop, despite the fact that there was no actual cop-who-was-also-a-samurai, ascended in rank to stand shoulder to shoulder with cinematic giants.  Decades later, its sequel Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance attempted a similar feat.

To this end, the producers of the film pulled no punches: they resurrected the careers of the original stars Mathew Karedas and Mark Frazier, franchise icons who have a combined 9 acting roles between them according to their IMDB profiles.  In addition, Bai Ling of Crow fame joins the high-energy cast along with Lexi Belle, Kayden Kross and Tommy Wiseau.

Tommy Wiseau demonstrates his acting range in this film, convincingly portraying a grief stricken underworld boss in one scene, a collected and competent leader in another, and - finally - a raving lunatic who is so emotionally compromised that he can barely utter a coherent sentence in another scene.  To this effect, Wiseau's acting is calculated and so naturally delivered that a casual audience member would conclude that he was incompetent and didn't know his lines.  Masterful.

In the end, there are few movies I could recommend as highly as Samurai Cop 2.  It has earned its place on my shelf next to Citizen Kane, Manborg and the original Samurai Cop.  It will be a classic my household revisits for years to come.",1459123200,3,1616,5.041353383458647

7413950,4,B014K32G8Q,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this movie, but had heard a lot of rumblings on the interwebz over it. I hadn't seen the original film at first, but started reading about it and all of it's funny mishaps/weird directing.

After I knew Tommy Wiseau was attached to this project, I knew I had to dive in. I would recommend seeing the films in order as this sequel has many fan service cameos from the first film.

Where the first film was trying to be serious and seemed offbeat/cheap, this one is way more self aware and silly. The story can get a bit jumbled with all of the characters introduced, but I still really enjoyed the ride. I thought the sound and picture quality were excellent and afterwards went back and saw the first film, which has a different feel to it than this one.

If you like B-Movies, so bad they are good movies and Tommy Wiseau, I'd recommend this crazy romp. However, if you go into this looking for a straight up action flick, or something along the lines of Die Hard, you will probably end up disappointed.

I knew what I was getting into, and had a great time the 2 times I watched it thus far. Do you need to see the first? Not really, but I'd recommend it for all the references and small call backs.

On a negative note, some of the cast consists of porn stars which have some really bad acting chops. But I thought Mark Frazer and Matt Hannon were great and probably had a fun time making this movie. I also wish Tommy Wiseau was a little more intelligible. That being said his scenes are mesmerizing in a very weird way. He yells, smoke fills the room, and he keeps yelling. It's quite strange. But funny.

Check it out for a silly movie night, it's pretty fun and crazy. Then start looking into all the back stories and interviews, it even adds more depth to these two films.

They got back most of the original stars of the first film and they all do a great job. But all of them couldn't save this film. It is very very confusing. You really can't understand what is going on for most of the film. It seems like they shot scenes from 2 or 3 different scripts. Then instead of only using the scenes from one script they just used them all and cobbled them together into a dizzying mess. Then if you where not lost enough, the actors do weird things that really don't make sense in scenes. Which turns out those are nods to the director favorite films. Films which no one has ever heard of or seen.(I wouldn't know this if I hadn't watched the movie with the director commentary on) Let's see a lot of the sets are weird and futuristic even though the movie is supposed to take place in the present day. There is also a CGI death ball that's strange and makes no sense. Tommy Wiseau is in the movie from ""The Room"". He does a good job and is very funny.

The original was not made to be awful. What made it such a classic was that the director believed he was making a good movie. Amir poured his heart and soul into his films and it showed.

Samurai Cop 2 is nothing more than a film made to be bad and to cash in on Amir's original genius. I was really, really stoned and it still was weak.

In the words of the Speed and Tyrone from Sneaking in the Movies n' Sh$t, I give this movie, ""The finger.""",1455580800,3,642,4.432203389830509

This feels like a mess and a cheap cash-in on something that is beloved by a certain community.  It lacks all charm from the original with the exception of Frazer and Karedas.  You can tell the two of them are doing their damnedest to make good on reprising their iconic roles.  The rest of the cast/film?  not so much.

The biggest problem with the movie is that there's basically no plot - it's just a collage of random unrelated scenes and bizarre dialogue that make no sense to the point of being brain-breaking.  It's as if an alien species came to Earth and decided to make that they thought was a movie - or like IBM's Watson was given key information but no soul to make a film.  It literally is a mess.  I found myself saying ""what the hell is going on?"" like every 5 minutes.  Everything is so completely random and meaningless.  One minute it's a detective film, 2 seconds later a sex scene for no reason, followed by some plot about alien orbs on a plane that lasts all of 3 minutes before moving on to the next random scene.  For no reason we'd get weird TV scenes that I think were dream sequences or something, with no explanation, then random scenes of Joe Marshall sword training on the beach. All of this with no relation to the plot  - well, the non existent plot.

As bad as I feel saying this, I say don't support this trash.  It's not like Deadliest Prey where you could tell there was some level of care put into recreating what made it memorable.  In this case, I think they just needed a bunch of names and faces to fill 90 minutes of screen time and had a bunch of random ideas rather than a cohesive plot or script.  It's a disaster in the worst way...a forgettable disaster.

I feel so bad for Frazer and Karedas.  I wanted this to be bad, but not this kind of bad.",1455062400,5,1942,4.282967032967033
7413957,1,B014K32G8Q,"This movie definitely lost the charm the first one had. I had a feeling it wasn't going to meet my expectations, but I didn't think it would be as awful as it really was. I will say, it was nice to see cameos of people from the first film, but those weren't enough to save the movie from being really bleh.

The movie was going nowhere the entire time. Everything was random, confusing, and the scenes contained no actual segues. I had a difficult time knowing what the hell was going on in the film. If that was their intention, that alone made it bad and hard to watch. The first film had an idea of everything, but was just executed poorly. This one felt like a giant mess.

It was as if they were trying too hard to recreate the same magic the first one contained. Making the sequel, they were aware what made the original movie so beloved. The acting was stale, the special effects were bland, the continuity was a joke, and the overall film was trying too hard in being taken seriously. This movie tried to emulate its success and the result just didn't feel right.

I'd only recommend this film if it were super cheap. Around $5, this movie would be good to confuse the hell out of your friends. Other than that, I would advise you to save your money to spend on the original Samurai Cop.",1454889600,21,1295,4.320987654320987
7413958,4,B014K32G8Q,"Samurai Cop 2 is the definition of a fan film.  This was born out of a kickstarter campaign, and the love for the original movie really shines through.  It doesn't mean the sequel is good or bad, but the passion is obvious.

Samurai Cop 1 and 2 really reminds me of Deadly Prey and Deadliest Prey.  The sequels, made decades after the fan-loved original, represent more of a friendly revisiting of the source material more than an actual attempt at making a true film.  Samurai Cop 2 features a TON of cameos from the first film.  That's a big part of the fun of watching it.  There's also tons of nudity.

What I didn't like about SC2 was 1) The terrible soundtrack and 2) the plot doesn't quite gel.  It's all over the place and doesn't really flow.  3) The CGI blood isn't overly impressive.

I'd give it more of a 3.5/5.  I enjoyed watching it, but it's not great.  Fun for cameos and to see our two partners team up again to kick some you know what.",1454371200,8,954,4.292134831460674

7413960,2,B014K32G8Q,"Highly disagree that this is better than the original film. I was extremely excited for this sequel and was quite disappointed when I finally saw it.
The movie makes no sense. There are way too many characters. Most of which you never get the point of or who they are supposed to be. If there was a script, I think it was quickly abandoned for ""Hey, you know what might look cool here instead!"" type of movie making. There was no cohesion to the scenes, and not in a good way like the original. It was just a mess. There are funny parts, but mostly I just kept asking, out loud,  ""What the Hell is going on?"" I will be watching it again, since I own it,  maybe it will make more sense a second time around (highly doubt it).
If you loved Samurai Cop,  don't get your hopes too high for this one.",1453248000,9,795,4.14935064935065

Samurai Cop 2 should really be on the look out for REAL actors.  That's what's missing.  Oh, yeah, and a script.  That wouldn't hurt one bit.

8731035,5,B014K32G8Q,"This movie is a sequel to the cheesy flick from 1991 and the only reason I watched this was that the folks from RiffTrax made an episode from the original (available on Prime).  Going in, I knew it would be a ridiculous and over the top.  This movie will never win any awards, but it wasn't made for that.  (It's a passion project funded by an IndieGoGo and Kickstarter.)

The film is a mixture of awkward flashbacks, bad wigs, over the top acting, and spray tan.  Some of the original cast reprise their roles.  The rest is made-up of actresses from adult films and B-movie staples (like Joe Estevez).  It has every trope possible: seductive assassins, dream sequences, the badest bad guys, martial arts gangs, lost love, and ex-partners reuniting.  If you want pure entertainment, suspend judgment and you'll enjoy it..

It was as bad as I had hoped. I mean come on, Tommy Wiseau is in it :) And I had to turn on CC just so I could know what he was saying. The acting was atrocious, and I think they must have found half the actors at a bad plastic surgery convention. I loved it! If you're looking to enjoy a really bad movie, this one has got you covered.

8731040,2,B014K32G8Q,"If you thought Samurai Cop was bad... you're in for a treat.  Not only is the acting horrendous, but the plot line feels like it's been written by a 5th grader who was up all night watching action movies and drinking Mountain Dew.  It's bad, guys... like really really bad.  Had to watch it twice because the story line was so hard to follow I walked out of the room the first time I tried to watch it.  I feel like Tommy Wiseau's presence forced elements of The Room into the movie that didn't really flow (he has a minor freak-out midway through the film and starts destroying the set for no reason... as seen in The Room).  And I wonder if Tommy had some influence in writing the plot as the storyline was all over the place.  I appreciate the cameos, and seeing the lion in almost every scene... but man, this was a bad film!  It's exactly what you would expect from a sequel to one of the worst movies ever made.  Did I hate it?  No.  But it's going to take a lot for me to watch it again.",1492992000,,994,4.130208333333333
8731041,1,B014K32G8Q,"The original Samurai cop is hilariously bad and engaging, which has made it such a cult classic. This boring drivel feels like some stoner in high school with no real grasp of all of the nuances that make the so-good-it's-bad genre work thought that a few nods to the original in an otherwise lackluster film was enough to make a sequel. The only redeeming factor is the performances of some of the original cast. This film is chaotic with no plot or direction, obnoxiously over-the-top performances in a misguided attempt at humor, and over-reliance on bad CGI. The subtleties that make the cult classic B movies are nowhere to be found, with nothing but a hollow shell that will leave you either fast asleep or wishing you were.",1492905600,4,730,4.7109375
