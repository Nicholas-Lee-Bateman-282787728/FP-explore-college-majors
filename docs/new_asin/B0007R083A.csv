2232986,4,B0007R083A,"My biggest disappointment with ""Family Jewels"" is the realization that there is obviously some good concert footage that remains unreleased.

Highlights:

- Seeing the band (clips, live or whatever) from before the ""Highway to Hell"" tour.

- The songs that are actually live, including ""Show Business"", ""Sin City"", ""Riff Raff"" (from the used for 1978's 'If You Want Blood' live album), ""Fling Thing/Rocker"", ""Whole Lotta Rosie"", ""Let's Get It Up"" and ""For Those About To Rock""

- The people on the street during ""It's a Long Way To The Top"" wondering who the heck these weirdos are...along with the trio of bagpipers.

- Seeing the progression of Angus' wardrobe.  He wore a bookbag as late as '78.

- The low low price.

Lowlights:

- A few of the things labeled as ""Live"" aren't really live, but instead are Bon singing live over the album track.  This goes for ""Baby Please Don't Go"",  ""T.N.T"" and ""Dirty Deeds"".

- The pain I feel everytime the two balls bang together before each clip.

- Nothing after 1991 is included.

- Simon Wright.

- The Fly On the Wall stuff is a little cheesy.  Looks like the same place where they filmed Pat Benatar's ""Love Is a Battlefield"" dance-off...",1112054400,6,1187,4.717073170731707
2232987,5,B0007R083A,"This truely is the ultimate AC/DC video collection.  The first ever video footage of Bon Scott on DVD (I believe) is here.  DVD 1 starts off with the band doing a cover (and a very good one) of Baby Please Don't Go from 1975.  It starts off with Phil Rudd with a smile on his face and you soon find out why that smile is there.  Bon Scott looks like a Heidi from hell with a blonde wig and a dress, rolling his make-up covered eyes like a woman.  Angus, innocence stitched into every fabric of his school boy uniform, is there rocking moving his legs and banging his head like a demonic child.  Phil is wearing a Camel cigarrete shirt.  In the middle of the song Bon Scott lights up a cigarrete and starts smoking, then proceeds to hitting Angus over the head with a pink rubber mallet.  When I saw it was hilarious and I knew this would be one unique DVD experience.  Song two, Show Business, has Bon wearing a striped jacket and top hat prancing around the stage brandishing a cane.  Then come a live version of High Voltage.  The next song is It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'N' Roll).  The band is riding on the back of a flatbed truck playing as they drive through some British city, with Bon and other Scots playing their bagpipes along in unison.  T.N.T. is next, then Jailbreak.  The video of Jailbreak starts off with Bon breaking rocks.  Then it moves to Malcolm is his guard uniform and Angus dressed as a prisoner.  In Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap some girls rush on the stage, and one of them is very ugly.  After that there's Dog Eat Dog, then Let There Be Rock.  Let There Be Rock takes place in a Catholic Church with Bon as the father and Angus and a demented choir boy with a halo bouncing around his head.  It's hilarious.  Then there's Rock 'N' Roll Damnation, Sin City, and Riff Raff.  In Fling Thing/Rocker, the band are all dressed in soccer uniforms, to solute the ""champions"".  Angus starts the song off by playing the Scottish (I believe) national anthem, and it sounds great.  After that there's Whole Lotta Rosie done live, then Shot Down In Flames, Walk All Over You, Touch Too Much, and If You Want Blood (You've Got It) filmed in the studio.  Then great versions of Girls Got Rythym and Highway to Hell live from ""Aplauso"".  DVD one is what Bon Scott fans have been waiting for for a very long time.  It has Bon prancing around showing amazing showmanship and Malcolm playing high voltage power chords (standing still).  Then it has Angus bouncing his brains around and doing a crazy, fast version of Chuck Berry's duck walk.  Angus Young is one of my favorite guitarists.  He might not be as talented as say Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton but he's way cooler.  He runs around like a demonic school boy not a day over twelve.  The only songs I felt were missing were The Jack, Bad Boy Boogie, Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be (false statement) and Problem Child, maybe a few others.
The second disc showcases the band from the 80's and 90's under their second lead singer, Brian Johnson.  People bash Brian because he's not as good as Bon, but he's still great.  I don't think AC/DC would be near as popular as they are now under any other lead singer.  It anyone could fill the role of Bon, it's this guy.  Brian is a coal miner's son and represents the working class.  His voice sounds like he drinks a glass of boiling water every morning but I love it.  When most bands get a new singer, like Van Halen with Sammy Hagar, I lost interest in them, but with AC/DC they just got better.  The first four songs of DVD 2 are Hells Bells, Back In Black, What Do You Do For Your Money Honey, and Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, all filmed in studio.  It's amazing, I think Brian's voice really shines in these songs.  His voice with the Young Brothers' riffs, Phil's druming, and Evan's bass sound like the full forces of nature.  Then there's live versions of Let's Get It Up and For Those About To Rock (We Salute You).  Then a studio version of Flick Of The Switch and Nervous Shakedown.  Then comes a weird but cool home video called Fly On The Wall, featuring Fly On The Wall, Danger, Sink The Pink, Stand Up, and Shake Your Foundations.  It has a guy introducing the band and he says ""AC/DC!  What is that an electrical company?"".  Then there's promo clips of Who Made Who and You Shook Me All Night Long.  Then an excellent version of Heatseeker featuring Angus poping out of a missle.  Then there's That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll, Thunderstruck, Moneytalks, and closes with Are You Ready.
This DVD set is a must-own for any true fan of AC/DC.  There is no filler on these DVDs, its all excellent hard blues-rock at its best.  Every song on his is worth listening to more than once, that's what makes it so great.  This is the greatest AC/DC DVD set ever released (in my humble opinion).  Get it now.
Also, after this, they need to release a DVD of Let There Be Rock - The Movie - In Paris from 1979.  I own the VHS version and it rocks.",1111968000,10,4986,4.32829373650108
2232988,5,B0007R083A,"AC/DC FAMILY JEWELS DVD - IN STORES MARCH 29th!

Seeing AC/DC on television has always been a rare occurance. After all, this was the band that tried to ""blow up your video"" during the height of MTV's late-'80's boom. Television appearances and promotional music videos have always been a necessary evil to this band of no-nonsense rockers. But when they did grace the airwaves it was like a bolt of lightning - their energy and spirit transforming a typically staged video into something magical and larger-than-life.

Here, for the first time, is the definitive history of AC/DC on video. DVD 1 starts with their breakthrough performance of ""Baby Please Don't Go"" on Australian television, through early promo clips, their rare turn on 70's mainstay The Midnight Special and ends with the Spanish television performance taped just ten days before singer Bon Scott's death. DVD 2 traces the classic 80's and 90's videos and includes - for the first time on DVD - the home video titles Fly On The Wall, Who Made Who and Clipped. Family Jewels is indeed a rare glimpse of this giant band on the small screen.

I had lost touch for many years, but checked it out and thought I'd give it a look.  Boy, was I NOT disappointed!  From the first video clip with Bon in a dress and pigtails, I was hooked with the band all over again.  I couldn't stop watching this DVD, nor could I stop bobbing my head and tapping my foot... this DVD is a must have for any AC/DC fan.

I had not seen much material with Bon Scott as far as live concerts and was hoping this set would contain some actual live footage with live audio. I did enjoy the video but it is obvious that the audio is dubbed on top of the video from studio tracks. This was very lame to say the least. I could have just played my CD collection while watching this and had same result. What a jip. I would have rather listened to the bad audio than the over-dubbs. I would recommened this only to people who have never seen Bon perform. Don't expect any live material as this is as stale and commercialized as it gets.

2233304,5,B0007R083A,"Though they're undoubtedly best known for Back in Black, anyone who's been to an AC/DC concert will know they have an incredibly strong back catalog. Up until now they've never released a best-of CD, though maybe you could use their Live release from 1992 for that purpose. Now, however, we have this DVD. More than just a list of singles from 1975 to 1992, what we've got is a snapshot history of the band.

Disc 1 has the Bon stuff. I could describe all the cheesy gimmicks on display here - Bon dressed as a schoolgirl; the band playing in an old quarry with explosions going on around them; riding through central Melbourne on the back of a truck with a three-piece bagpipe band, etc... but that would detract from the three things that need to be said:

1. Bon Scott's stage presence. He had this cheeky wink, and intense stare. To be able to focus the audience's attention on you when your lead guitarist is Angus Young is no mean feat, but Bon pulls it off. And his singing on the live tracks is fantastic - passionate and rock solid.

2. Angus Young. In every clip on this disc, he just bobs up and down and will not stop moving. You can't take your eyes off him,  cause it looks like he loses a pound of sweat each performance.

3. The music. All these tracks are the latest Sony remasters, and the PCM audio is better than CD quality. Honestly, I've never heard some of these songs so good.

The tracks are all arranged in chronological order, and accordingly the settings change - from Australia, to Britain, and finally America. And the progression seems like the most natural thing in the world, they were just that good.

Disc 2 covers the Brian era, in particular the years from 1980 to 1991 when they were at their commercial peak. Proceedings start appropriately enough: the Back in Black clips are all straight live performances, honoring Bon Scott's memory with plain simple hard rock. Thereafter, however, things scale up. The clips feature ever-larger arenas full of ever more frenzied fans screaming at an AC/DC on ever larger stages playing under ever larger props. (Only Thunderstruck, with its towering set and Angus duckwalking, really pulls this trick off). It's a pity because it's like these clips are trying to sell you something - the cheekiness, the fun is gone.

Still, the music sounds as good as ever. The remastered audio even manages to make Fly on the Wall sound good, that's how much of a revelation it is.

There are things missing, but the minimalist presentation works well for a band like AC/DC, who were always content to let the music do the talking. And this is a better documentary record of one of the greatest bands ever than anything else you're likely to come across.",1135209600,2,2718,4.6107660455486545
2233305,5,B0007R083A,"OK, if you have ever considered yourself an AC/DC fan, you must have this disk! This has been one of my most played DVDs, and for good reason. This is a treasure trove of tv and video performances, many those of us in the US haven't got to see before. Disk 1 is the Bon Era, and contains early Austrailian tv promos and videos that are a blast to watch. These were pre-MTV, and therfore mostly not available here. I do remember the Midnight Special performance of Sin City, and it's great to see that again, but there's much more here. I equally enjoy Disk 2 with Brian. Even if you watched the original MTV Headbangers Ball as I did, most of the 80's and 90's videos were never overexposed. Other than a proper DVD release of Let There Be Rock (hint to Albert Productions), I couldn't want more in an AC/DC DVD. Buy this!",1133308800,2,822,4.309677419354839
2233306,5,B0007R083A,"Props to Brian, but it was Bon voyage after 1980.

Bon Scott sang his heart out. He didn't try. He just did it. No effort. Never straining. Always on. He was the ultimate rocker.

Disk 1 of this DVD captures the awesomeness of a rock band that is unduplicated. The Bon Scott years was the definition of what ""real"" hard rock was in the late 70s to the tragic death of Bon in 1980. And that definition lives on , and is immortalized, through this DVD and the music that AC/DC created during Bon's time.

This DVD is a keeper. A collector's item. Songs like Dog Eat Dog, Sin City, Riff Raff, a total of 20 live performances on disk 1 alone with the ultimate final song on disk 1 being the cruel irony of Highway to Hell...the highway that Bon took in 1980.

Okay, enough of the dramatics.

Buy this for disk one alone. If you grew up listening to AC/DC during the Bon Scott years you will be in awe when you watch this and clearly realize what an inspiration this band was to Metal. Watch Bon as he sings; there is no effort in his performances...he is simply having fun and doing what comes naturally to him.

Almost all of the songs on disk 1 are actual live performances. And you know that you are watching one of the best frontmen ever because even most of the promos are not lip synced.

Watching disk 2 will really make you appreciate what AC/DC had prior to the stupidity of rockers like Bon and (John) Bonham. They had a band chemistry that you can't duplicate...NO MATTER WHAT.

Brian Johnson ""tries to sing."" Okay there are some cool AC/DC tunes (awesome even) with Brian. But the guy is straining to get the vocals out...especially live. That was not an issue for Bon Scott.

Disk 2 is all Brian, and I'd have paid the price of this DVD collection for just the Brian stuff. So don't think that this review is a Brian dis. It's not. This review is a tribute to the awesomeness that was the original AC/DC, and the awesomeness of the complete AC/DC story that this DVD captures. I just happened to grow up in the 70s, and my bias is with an amazing singer (Bon Scott) that I have never, ever seen anything like since.

If you buy this collection you perhaps will appreciate what I am saying.

Angus...well...he is Angus...the guy never runs out of energy. He jumps around like a hungry monkey in every clip...both disks. Phil Rudd is one of the most simple drummers ever, but make no mistake, I'd trade drumming talent for Phil Rudd's instinct to make an awesome song any day of the week.

I feel like I'm rambling here, so let's leave it at this: If you liked the Bon Scott years, there's no question that you should buy this DVD. If you like the Brian years, you get a bonus DVD of the inspiration for it all.

So just hit the buy button. There is no way you won't be satisfied.",1132704000,7,2787,4.316091954022989

2233308,5,B0007R083A,"MORE, I want more disc one.  Unbelievable early footage that shows the incredible talent of the late Bon Scott.  From his cheeky eye rolls and animated melodramatic asides to the shadow of himself in the final few performances, this disc is truly mesmerizing.  You really get to see the evolution of the early ACDC.  The costumes that evolve, as in the case of Angus's Rugby rat, schoolboy, angel, etc., to the schoolboy he is today.  The costumes that devolve like Bon's schoolgirl, priest, and ringmaster in contrast to the tacky jailbreak workshirts with the arrows.  The transitions between tracks are extremely annoying.

Disc two is very good as well, but I have seen Brian Johnson live many times, so it's not as novel.  The Donnington set really does him justice.

I want more, more, more, of the really early stuff when you could tell they were having a blast.  Watch disc one in order and you can see the stress and wear and tear on the band members as the tracks progress.  No voice-over is needed to point out the difference between the first track and the last one.  And yet, what an absolute loss of a charismatic lead no matter how worn down he had gotten.  The last few tracks seem to show a jaded group disgusted with the demands of the music business, lip syncing when they were so riveting live.  What a powerful vignette.  But hey, where's Big Balls, The Jack, TNT, and all of the rest of the tongue-in-cheek hallmarks of Bon Scott and the Young brothers' writing style?  I want more Bon, early Bon, late Bon and ALL BON ACDC.  This set will get you started and keep you reloading both discs over and over again!",1132012800,3,1632,4.553264604810996
2233309,5,B0007R083A,"The first disc is the Bon Scott years....

Right from the beggining you will understand how BON's presence ment so much to the formitive years of this band. BABY PLEASE DONT GO is I believe the bands very first TV appearance in Australia. This is where the public was introduced to the band.. ANGUS in his first school boy outfit and BON in a dress and wig... carrying a mallet.

Such showmen, they were filthy and frightening... but in a fun kind of way; this is WHY AC/DC are so great. The BON stuff is a real treat for me because its stuff that is hard to find until now. All the stuff I've heard about for years. Its really great!

The second disc is BRIAN JOHNSON years, all good stuff too, even though I've seen all of this before. Its all good stuff compiled mainly from the bands three home videos from the eighties FLY ON THE WALL; WHO MADE WHO; and CLIPPED. They are all in their entirety here, so you can't say you are getting jipped. AC/DC do like to mess with us all a little bit, but now and again they deliver a handsome impressive package such as this.

However, being such a HUGE fan I must lay down some constructive critisism....

(2 things)

1. Get rid of those computer animated balls between EVERY segment.

2. Why no videos from BALLBREAKER or STIFF UPPER LIP?

Then DvD two starts off with "" Hells Bells"" from 1980 and ends with are you ready from 1990. It covers 40 songs. It is awesome and you won't be disappointed.",1128988800,2,487,4.411111111111111
2233313,5,B0007R083A,"I remember being 8 years old in 1983, when I saw a video on Mtv that strangely frightened me.  A dark stage, a screaming singer with a cap pulled down over his eyes, loud music whose structure I couldn't place, with a loud electric guitar coming from a guy in knickers who moved with as much energy as any human could move.  The credits revealed that it was it AC/DC with ""For Those About To Rock"".

Two years later at the age of 10, ""Sink the Pink"" and ""Danger"" were in good rotation, and that's what prompted me to make one of my earliest music purchases, the ""Fly on the Wall"" album (I remember having to give up my allowance that week and the money in my pocket that night so that my parents would buy it for me).

So fast forward 20 years.  I've long since bought every AC/DC album on either cassette or CD, in some instances both.  I saw them twice in concert (1988, 1991).  I had loved them, but at some point just lost interest in the band all together.  Maybe I just got sick of them.  Then after renting the movie ""Thunderstruck"", my interest was renewed, and I ran out and bought this DVD set, ""Family Jewels"".  Well, they re-sold me!  This DVD reminded me of how many damn great songs they had, and the reasons why I liked AC/DC in the first place.

Each disc is packed with 20 videos, one from the Bon Scott years and one from the Brian Johnson years.  For the record, I've always lived both singers.  But geez, I didn't realize just how great of a showman Bon Scott was.  Sporting a wig and giant mallet in ""Baby Please Don't Go"", a straw hat and cane in ""Show Business"", bag pipes in ""It's A Long Way To The Top"", or even without any props, this guy was a full-fledged icon.  This ain't a case of a dead rock star being remembered just because he's dead.  Scott had this commanding presence and demented sneer that just screamed with carnal rock power.

The second disc brings us to the Brian Johnson years.  These videos include the ones that really introduced me to AC/DC, so they have a special value to me.  The live video clips from the ""Back In Black"" album and the ""For Those About To Rock"" video are here, as is ""Flick Of The Switch"" with the similar-looking ""Nervous Shakedown"".  Also included are contents of the ""Fly On The Wall"" and ""Who Made Who"" home videos (which I had owned on VHS), and the videos from ""Blow Up Your Video"" and ""Razor's Edge"".  People can criticze the ""Fly on the Wall"" concept video collection all they want, but I absolutely love it.  Watching AC/DC play in a dive of a bar, with the 1-dimensional characters playing their parts (papparazzi photographer in Columbo trench coat, hack MC comic, rich couple who get the wrong drink order, etc.), just fits the music so well and is downright fun to watch.

A couple of things are notably absent from this collection.  The videos for ""I Put The Finger On You"", ""Big Gun"", and ""Hard as a Rock"" aren't here.  They proabably had more that I'm not aware of.  I also remember the Mtv version of ""Sink The Pink"" being different than the home video version, where Angus uses his guitar to knock in the ball at the end, but that version doesn't seem to exist anywhere.  (Yet to think that this video convinced me as a kid that the song was really about billards!)  There are also no bonuses like audio commentaries or interview clips.  And of course the ""Let There Be Rock"" documentary is not here, but that really deserves its own DVD release.

Still, this collection offers a generous 40 videos, many of which I've never seen.  And to those fan too young to have been around in the days when Mtv actually played AC/DC videos (or any significant number of videos, for that matter), this might be their first time seeing these too.  I couldn't stop my head from nodding along, in fact I just wanted to headbang in some parts!  Most rock videos made after this era seemed to just be blurry scenes of guys whining in public bathrooms.  AC/DC's music is just no-B.S., no pretentiousness, high energy rock n' roll, and these videos show that the band likewise knows how to have a loud, fun time.",1127174400,39,4079,4.400534045393859
2233334,5,B0007R083A,"I've been a fan of these guys for over 20 years now, and they've seldom let me down. ""Family Jewels"" is a great collection. Others may complain about the studio tracks on some of the ""videos"", but I don't have an issue with any of that. I never got to see Bon Scott perform live when I was younger, so it was great to just see the old video footage of him kickin' it -- damn he was good!

The only complaint I have is ""Highway to Hell"" is poorly mastered...it seems to flutter during the chorus outros, but since I already have a collection of their songs, I didn't find this too terribly disappointing. You simply can't beat seeing these guys perform. No matter how commercial their sound was, they've always remained true to their roots and what motivated them to start playing, and you've got to respect them for that. AC/DC is the freaking best band on the planet hands down--they're my Rolling Stones...and ""Family Jewels"" is a great hold-over for those of us who need something between studio albums.",1127001600,2,1006,4.527472527472527

2233337,5,B0007R083A,"In 1979 I went to a ""Day On The Green"" at Oakland Coliseum. The day-long show was entitled ""Monsters of Rock."" There was a vast audience, as Bill Graham opened up the grassy area for the full-on stadium concert experience. The warm-up band was Mahogany Rush, then a little-known band named AC/DC and then Aerosmith.  The headliner was Ted Nugent.

Suffice it to say, I don't remember much that happened after AC/DC.  AC/DC was the most incredible event I have ever witnessed in my life.  These guys came out and just blow-torched 60,000+ people with the most staggering sonic pulsations known to man.  There was this weird chemistry between the crazed guitarist--who was obviously posssessed by one or more demons--and the singer, who was obviously on parole for some hideous crime spree.  The guitarist, later identified as one ""Angus Young,"" went down into the audience on the shoulders of security personnel.  Mr. Young was doing a crazed guitar solo which lasted maybe ten minutes.  His sweaty, pimply back was slapped by hundreds of maniacal onlookers.  Mr. Young kept playing, he didn't miss a frenzied note.  The singer--later identified as one Mr. Bon Scott--had his extremely tight blue jeans rip-out up to the crotch. He didn't seem concerned. He appeared older and more worldly than Mr. Young, who appeared as if he was just a mere child.  At one point Young and Scott collided on stage as Young had been running about so frenetically, dangerously deranged and negligent. They both fell to the stage floor, laughing. They got up, and continued their felonius assault upon the enthralled masses. It was an amazing thing to see 60,000+ fists up in the air with every person chanting ""Angus, Angus...""

The next day I checked the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle, certain to read a banner headline about this amazing development in World History.  For what I had seen the day before was not a mere concert, it was a Divine Event.  To my surprise, there was no headline (but there was an extremely flattering review in the entertainment section). Lest you think I exaggerate, should you spend any time in the San Francisco Bay Area, it will only be a matter of time before you meet someone (because there were so many) that was there that day, and they will tell you what I've told you.  I've seen hundreds of concerts since then, and nothing has come close.  I saw AC/DC a few times after this show, and they were awesome, but Bon Scott had died. There was just something totally magical about that combination of Angus and Bon, a yin-and-yang thing, that created a musical tension and synergism beyond human comprehension. This is primal-stuff here; you don't cognate it; you neurologically process it in your spine or in some primitive, low-order portion of your brain.

So, this set, ""Family Jewels,"" what does it do to explain the inexplicable?  What it does is take you back 25+ years to where these guys were at, where they came from.  It answers so many questions, satisfies so many curiosities, as to who these guys were then, who they are now, what they were like before they became ""famous.""  No, there are not any interviews here.  But, you get the far more fundamental and important information: What did they sound like and look like in smaller venues before they were anything bigger than a garage band?  Answer: they sounded fierce and deadly, sinister and deranged. But they have never taken themselves seriously.  Just the video clip of ""Let There Be Rock"" is worth the cost of this entire set (Bon is dressed up as a preacher; it's hilarious; it's perfect).

With Bon's death, there was an enormous gap to be filled.  No one on Earth could have done it better than Brian Johnson.  Whatever praise people sing about the legendary persona of Bon Scott, I have never heard anyone intend it as criticism of Johnson.  To him, an enormous debt is owed. He has made an amazing contribution to the legacy of this band.

The footage in these two discs is quite simply priceless.  I personally consider it some of the best music in the world, and in saying that I am making every effort to avoid exaggeration or hyperbole.  But it is simply true: these guys are great; they are historical figures; the only debate would be whether they are on the ""Top Five Best Bands of All Time"" or Top Ten.  For me, they are on the Top Three, if not The Top.  Watch these discs and you'll see why.

How much would I pay for these discs if they were bootlegs? Hundreds? Thousands?  Answer: as much as I could beg, borrow, steal.",1126396800,34,4538,4.695322376738306
2233338,5,B0007R083A,"Huge fan of this rock band since I first heard them way back when.  Came to amazon and was amazed when I saw what this collection had.  Basically, this DVD has everything, every song you could ever want to hear/see from this group.

The packaging is simple and the only annoyance I have is this is a 2 disc set, and they didn't use a dual disc box.  One disc overlaps another, so if you want to get to the back disc, you must pop out the front one.  Not a major deal, but something that could have been easily fixed.

So, if you are an AC\DC fan and you would like 40 of their best songs and be able to watch them...then pull out your wallet, let your MONEYTALK and purchase this set.  You will not be disappointed.",1126137600,,715,4.100719424460432

The newer stuff with Brian Johnson up front was also good, although I think he hardly compares to Bon, the original members still rock big time. I highly recommend this true jewel to all.",1125273600,,355,4.085714285714285
2233340,5,B0007R083A,"I've never been an AC/DC fan.  My 6 and 8 year old boys sort of tripped over the band in a book store listening to clips.  They are playing drums and guitar and I've been playing drums for many years.  I new a little of this band.  They have always seemed to respond to heavier bands so I included Back in Black with a stack of discs they took over to the listening stations.  They seemed to really get off on this band and so I bought them two CDs.  In an effort to continue to feed their interest I bought this DVD without knowing much about the band.

Wow!  The live clips are extraorinary!  This is a great representation of a great rock and roll band.  It's great to see the progression of the material over the years.  These guys had chops that just got better and better.  My kids don't want to watch anything else.  This was a score because it has gotten my boys watching live performances and will clear the way for me to show them a lot more material.

Yes there are a number of lip sinked videos but so what.  There is so much material here you can always skip the clips you don't like.  I find the video performances to be great period pieces from the early days of the music video concept.

2233374,3,B0007R083A,"First off I want to say that this is in fact a really REALLY nice release. It was about time we got a quality release from this great band. But, there are problems:

1) The most annoying clip of balls clicking and that power chord before every clip, WHY! Pure Torture....

2) Garbage clips when they could have put great stuff. I didn't need to have the fly on the wall video. They package it like I'm getting something great, what you get is hardly any AC/DC and a really bad conceptual piece with a bunch of no name actors dancing around, and the most screen time goes to a completely unlikeable guy playing a reporter/photographer. Press the skip button repeatedly....

3) I like video promo clips, I love actual live performances, I HATE LIP SYNCHED TV APPEARENCES, there are just too many, but I can tolerate the 1975 Baby Please Dont Go, but the HIGH VOLTAGE clip is so obviously from the same concert as the SHOW Business clip, yet I'm watching a live performance with the studio version playing, it's killing me....SKIP!

4) Instead of the FLy on The Wall and Clipped videos, couldn't we have the complete Glascow 1978 video, with the complete Bad Boy Boogie? Or how about the Awesome ""Rock Goes to College"" concert, also from 1978 with a great rendition of Problem Child?

5) Where are the great Brian Johnson video clips of ""Put The Finger On You"" ""For Those About To Rock"" and ""Back In Black"" From the Hartford, CT 12/81 concert? Instead we get the truely awful Heatseeker and Thats the way I Want My Rock And Roll.... Where is ""Guns For Hire"" from the Flick of the Switch sessions?

The Best? How about the SHOW BUSINESS clip with a solo featuring MALCOLM YOUNG!

Ok, and the scorching live version of LETS GET IT UP when Brian still had his Geordie pipes!

For years I've had a clip of ac/dc playing Baby Please don't go live from 1976 on vhs. It has angus yelling at the crowd to get loud and bon interupts with ""Why Didnt I Think Of That?"" That would have been a great addition to this set. Also the scandinavian interview segment where Bon and Angus talk about the early releases would have been nice.

2233377,4,B0007R083A,"After Back in Black, AC/DC don't mean much to me. They became more plodding and reliant on Mrs Slocum-like malapropisms and Benny Hill double-entendres. Nonetheless, the Bon Scott-era AC/DC is probably one of the 5 best bands of the late 70s (better than Kiss for example) and the first disc of this collection is wall-to-wall rock'n'roll magic. The video of Long Way to the Top is a trip down memory lane for all Melbournians (I'm sitting 200 metres from where Bon played his bagpipe solo as I type) and the songs are incredibly strong and surprisingly timeless (it's not like AC/DC are respected for their composing!). Highway to Hell has one of the top 3 riffs of all time and the Jailbreak video inspired the purchase of thousands of felon pyjamas amongst late 70s Australian pre-adolescents. The clip for You Shook Me All Night Long (their best post-Bon song) is a crap 1986 soft-porn effort - the original was shot in the same session as the clips for Noise Pollution and Hells Bells, so this collection is not to be considered an historical document. The Australian (rental) version had no extras and the ones on here sound interesting although they are probably clips from 70s Australian pop show Countdown (as are a few of the early clips in the main collection). Ignoring the 2nd disc, the collection is a good mix of artfully cheeky clips that don't stray too far from straight forward rockin' performance set-ups, combined with ""live"" TV performances which show what a great band they were. BTW - you need to see the Australian ABC documentary series ""Long Way to the Top"" to see an AC/DC interview in London from 1976 - Bon Scott's denim cut-offs have to be seen to be believed and could make them gay icons.",1122940800,,1721,4.701986754966887

Television appearances and promotional music videos have always been a necessary evil to this band of no-nonsense rockers.

=================

This is a very indepth look at one of the greatest RNR bands to ever walk the planet. It's filled with tons of great videos from the Bon / Brad years, and they cover a few live tracks as well...

The only complaint I would have is that there aren't enough live videos here. They have one from the 1981 ""For Those About To Rock Tour""-{Let's Get It Up}, and one live performance of {For Those About To Rock} live at Joe Lewis Arena in 1983. That's about it, everything else is promo vidoes....

I want the entire 1983 JL Arena show released. That was an incredible show, and to only have one video from it on ""Family Jewels"" sucks. ACDC is a live band. That's where they kick it into another gear, and let loose. I wish there was more of that here. Other than that, this is a must purchace for any RNR fan...",1117324800,2,844,4.22360248447205

2233408,5,B0007R083A,"After picking up this DVD this weekend, I have come to realize that Bon Scott is sorely missed today by me. I never had the chance to see him and AC/DC live, but all singers need to take a look at his performance on this DVD. The way he stands and sings, Bon had the posture down. While the footage is kinda choppy, the sound is great on a surround sound system. The first disc is all Bon from the early beginnings. ""Baby Please Don't Go"" shows the world that AC/DC, even in the early days, could rock the crowd.

The 2nd disc is from the Brian Johnson era. Most people only know AC/DC from Back in Black. If you are a fan, its important to know the band from both versions. Most people don't like the ""Fly on the Wall"" videos, but it was a product of the times. I remember watching the old VHS version and the album is not up to par with Back in Black or For those about to Rock, but its still required listening. The two clips from the latter album, Let's Get it Up and For those about to rock are good, but I can remember seeing a live clip for Put the Finger on You which is not here. Also a clip of Guns For Hire is not on there either. Other clips didn't make it on there from the Johnson days. Oh well, now if they just release Let there Be Rock on widescreen DVD, my collection will be complete.",1115596800,3,1303,4.030888030888031
2233409,5,B0007R083A,"""Family Jewels"" is more than a DVD from AC/DC.  For the diehard fan, it's an answered prayer.  Here, we get the entire visual history of the band separated by two discs: the first DVD features the early stuff with original lead singer Bon Scott (this year, by the way, is the 25th anniversary of his death) and the second features current lead singer Brian Johnson.  While both discs are great, my personal favorite is the one with Bon Scott. We get a slew of live performances and promotional clips; the best among the bunch are ""It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock and Roll),"" ""Let There Be Rock,"" ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,"" and ""Jailbreak.""  The majority of these clips are rarely shown (at least in America), so it's great that they appear on this collection.  The Brian Johnson disc covers the band's videos from 1980 to 1990, starting with their breakthrough smash ""Back in Black.""  The lighting is pretty bad during these particular videos, but it's still a treat to watch the band rip through classics like ""Hells Bells,"" ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" and ""What You Do For Money Honey.""  Other clips of note include ""Who Made Who,"" ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" (the song was released in 1980 but the video came out in '86 for the ""Maximum Overdrive"" movie), and the videos from the unfairly maligned ""Fly on the Wall"" LP.  The picture quality, however, is a mixed bag.  Many of the earlier clips have bad lighting, print flaws, and scratches.  This isn't a big deal with me.  What's important is that the sound quality is top notch, and you can feel the music project right out of your speakers.  So, if you're even remotely interested in AC/DC, you need to pick this bad boy up.  The excellent sound quality, the slew of video clips, and the relatively low price make this collection a winner.",1115510400,3,1825,4.578461538461538
2233410,5,B0007R083A,"I couldn't wait to buy this and the first day it came out I went straight to get it. Watching the first disc made me saddened that Bon died only ten days after the Highway to Hell video but those were 20 unforgettable music videos of his day. Disc 2 was great as well and I'm suprised not that many people liek Fly on the Wall. AC/DC is a band that I hope lives forever and this masterpiece shows the timeline of the band. From the cover version of Baby Please Don't Go to Are You Ready this is one AC/DC DVD you won't want to forget. I was so amazed that Bon came right back on tune after being knocked over during Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.

The only question I had was that the band put out some music videos for Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip that weren't on it but that just means that they'll make another DVd full of AC/DC goods. Great fun for any AC/DC fan and it's worth the ""Dirt Cheap"" price that it costs.",1115510400,2,920,4.082872928176796

I consider myself a fan, not a fanatic, and there was very little on this disc that I had seen previously. This is a no frills 40 song disc set that delivers precisely what it promises, some older rare footage of the band in perfect chronological order. I would loved to have seen them remix the disc in DTS or Dolby Digital but that's a minor complaint. Personally the lack of interviews is a plus as you can simply play the discs as if they were a standard cd without the annoying interviews in between each song. Overall video quality is probably about as good as it was possible to make it and sound is reasonable for PCM. If you are even a minor fan, there will be something for you in this set and I simply cannot see how anyone reading the liner notes and then buying the disc could possibly be disappointed. This isn't AC/DC live and in concert, it's a video montage of the band from their early years on and if you're interested in the beginnings of one of the truly great pure rock and roll bands, you'll enjoy this disc.",1115251200,5,1182,4.234513274336283

I expected something along the lines of the Pink Floyd ""Making of DSOTM"" disc or the Led Zeppelin 4 Disc set.  Unfortunaltely, after taking about 5 minutes to FF through the disc, I realized I'd been taken.  The so-called ""live"" performances are old clips that I'd seen before with the actual studio recordings dubbed over it, when I hear ""live"" I don't expect to hear the track that I could just listen to by putting in the CD.  Secondly, there weren't any interviews, commentary, or behind the scenes footage.  Nothing on this disc is new (as in never seen before).  In the end, it's just music videos and some Bon Scott videos that everyone has already seen.  I was disappointed and you may be too.",1114300800,5,909,4.401197604790419

Songs like ""Riff Raff"", ""Whole Lot of Rosie"", well the list goes on and on.  Buy this for disc 1 alone, it is worth the price.  I give this only 4 stars because of the Brian Johnson years.  Let's face it, ""Back in Black"" is their most successful release but the videos from there were obviously shot on a soundstage over the length of a day.  I hope not much longer.  The sameness of each video from it's respectable release just has the sameness to it that the performances aren't memorable unlike the separate video shoots from the early days.  And the songs just aren't as good on disc 2.  This collection reminds us how much we miss Bon Scott and just how great would this band be if they were still fronted by him.

2233439,5,B0007R083A,"This is a great collection of songs and videos by a great band.

I'll take it backwards:

The second DVD covers from ""Back in Black"" to ""Razor's Edge"" in 1991. The ""Back in Black"" footage is not the black and white live footage most of us have seen but color footage where they're on a stage. Other than the ""Flick of the Switch"" promos, the others were from ""Who Made Who"", ""Fly On The Wall"" (which is kept in its original mini-movie storyline), and ""Clipped"" videos, now being released on DVD.

Why ""Big Gun"" from ""Last Action Hero"" didn't make it, I don't know considering Sony put the soundtrack out. No videos from ""Ballbreaker"" and ""Stiff Upper Lip"" made it on here (although I think SUL has the videos as CD extras) because of them being signed to another label. Hopefully if they do a CD retrospective they will allow some of those songs on there. Even though there are pieces missing, the songs people know and love (""Back in Black"" gets 5 cuts) are here.

The audio quality is great, although anyone looking to hear it in Surround will be disappointed.

The first DVD is what makes this worth the purchase because a lot of people have never seen Bon Scott as the lead singer, and this is as up close as you can get. The dynamic between Angus and Bon comes off as being harmonic than competitive. You see a charismatic frontman that knows how to have fun with the crowd.

I think that what will surprise a lot of people are the promo videos like ""Let There Be Rock"", ""Jailbreak"", and the lifted from the Stones' back of the truck ""It's a Long Way To The Top"", all done years before MTV existed.

Just be forewarned that the audio quality on the live clips on the first DVD are not that great, but the video footage and frantic energy of the band more than makes up for it.

This is a great legacy if AC/DC never plays a note again.

Other than the missing songs, the other thing that bothered me were how the DVDs were packed, where the discs are touching.. It might be worth putting them in different packaging if you're going to play this one more than a few times.

Final comment: Let There Be Rock needs to be out on DVD, and the Australian versions of the Bon Scott era AC/DC should be released in the US as most of them are radically different.",1113350400,3,2259,4.344418052256532
2233440,5,B0007R083A,would recommended this to any ac/dc fan. if you like the brian johnson stuff you will definately love the bon scott stuff. bon scott ruled was just tragic couldn't have some of his interviews in it. both singers actually made this band great and would play it over and over again while listening to the cd's i dug out of the stuff that wasn't on the dvd.,1113264000,,354,4.298507462686567
2233441,5,B0007R083A,"Imagine that. A band releases a two DVD set that is music, music, and more music. We don't have whining. We don't have therapists, there's no internal power struggles, and there's no money grubbing middle-aged guys who just can't do it anymore. This is AC\DC's definitive collection of TV appearance's and videos. They let the music do the talking. Period.

If you like Bon Scot, you got Disc 1. If you like Brian Johnson, you got Disc 2. If you're like me and you love them both, you just throw either one in. This package is neat, tidy, and has a great price, less than the cost of a new CD.

If you need your fix of Angus and Co., look no further than Family Jewels. This set rocks from beginning to end.",1113177600,,707,4.30827067669173
2233442,5,B0007R083A,"I love this DVD, the Bon Scott material is the best I have ever seen. Brian Johnson is a great singer but he cant hold a candle to Bon Scott. I wasn't a fan of these guys till I heard ""Highway To Hell"" LP, I was hooked after that....too bad I never got to see Bon is his heyday. I love the song ""Rock and Roll Damnation"", a real powerhouse rocker, real head banging stuff. Im not going to go through every song on this DVD becuase that would take forever, but in my opinion the Bon Scott material blows the Brian Johson stuff away. Disc 2 is ok but I got bored watching it, There older stuff was way better than the 80s and 90s...... buy this DVD if its just for the 1st disc, you`ll see just how good these guys were. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!",1113177600,6,747,4.123287671232877

2233474,5,B0007R083A,"Simply Awesome!! From the interactive menus to all the remastered footage. Doesnt matter if Bon/Brian is your fav lead...plenty of each there for each taste. Add to that, some of the never seen before stuff like Who Made Who..and you have one DVD that's darn well worth every cent you'd pay for it.",1113091200,2,298,4.6415094339622645
2233475,5,B0007R083A,"The first time these guy blew me away was on their ""Highway to Hell"" Tour with Bon Scott. Now we have a two DVD collection split between the Bon years and the Brian years. Video quality as with any band improves as you get closer to the present.  This DVD set really rocks!!!  even better on a large screen with sound piped through your stereo.  These DVDs, and especially Angus Young got me so pumped up I drug my Les Paul and Marshall amp into the Living Room and rocked along with them.  I'm half way between Malcom and Angus's ages and still love to rock as hard as they were doing 30 years ago.  Angus is a one of a kind rock guitarist and you won't be disappointed here.  I always thought Brian Johnson did an amazing job of keeping the vocal true to the spirit of Bon Scott and both men could truly sing anything the other could if only Bon were still here.  Bon shows he's more, ""in your face"" and interacting with the audience more as you can see here.  This DVD also confirmed for me that ironically the very BEST AC/DC is and always will be Highway to Hell and Back in Black, the end of the Bon era and the beginning with Brian era. This an excellent history of AC/DC and ranks right up there next to the Concert for George and Led Zeppelin DVDs in the wonderful impression it leaves. Then again if any of you are like me, watching Angus is like feeling a part of the wild man inside yourself and makes you want to get up and dance. If you like AC/DC, this is a must have DVD.  I've had it three days and as I write am watching them for the the third time, it's addictive!",1113004800,2,1583,4.130293159609121
2233476,4,B0007R083A,"I'm actually a little disappointed with this release. Sure, it does have some great footage I haven't seen before, but there are a few clips missing, I was really hoping the might have been hidden eggs on the discs but I've searched the disc's and there is nothing hidden.

The DVD package is one of those cardboard foldout things, so by the time I got the rapping off it was already wrinkled and falling apart. But the shiny gloss looks cool, kind of like a mirror.

It comes with a booklet with some brief words about AC/DC and where and when the tracks are from.

On disc 1 there are 20 Bon clips, ranging from mimed studio clips to live performances. Some are not very good quality, the sound is screwed on a few of them, but you can't fix what old age has done to the print. There are a few Bon clips missing tho.

- Dog Eat Dog (a different version)

- Dirty Deeds (Studio version)

- Let There Be Rock (Live Promo)

- Highway To Hell (original clip)

If they wanted to, they could have even thrown the ""Can I sit next to you girl"" video in with original singer Dave Evans.

On Disc 2 there is all the Brian Johnson clips. Including the entire ""Fly on the wall"" video. Fly is without a doubt one of the most underrated albums of all time, but it's sad to say the Fly video clips are some of the stupidest of all time. Even the band will tell you they are dumb.

But I was really looking forward to seeing the videos they did after the razors edge album. But that is as far as the Brian era goes.

Missing.

-You Shook Me All Night Long (original clip)

- Rock Your Heart Out

- Big Gun

- Ball breaker

- Cover You In Oil

- Hard As A Rock

- Hail Caesar

- Stiff Upper Lip

- Satellite Blues

- Safe In New York City

Where are those clips? There all owned by Sony, why weren't they included? Each disc runs for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, the missing clips would fit very easily with no hassles.

There is also a discography on disc 2, but there is no commentary from the Young's like they did on the Donnington DVD.

I really think this DVD could have been a lot better, but it's still good value for money, it's got most of the clips and the sound on 95% of the songs is good. Just a few of the early ones aren't very good.",1113004800,2,2234,4.071100917431193

The video footage is awesome, but the sound is brutal. It's not in digital!! But Why?

2233479,5,B0007R083A,"This si the greatest dvd I've ever owned! This has most of the classics from Bon Scott, and lots of great stuff from Brian Johnson
The only thing I would've liked to see is the Stiff Upper Lip video which was great where the band gets caught in a traffic jam and starts playing on top of cars
Amazing DVD!",1112918400,,305,4.1
2233480,4,B0007R083A,"You will not find a more thorough documentation of ac/dc's TV appearances then on this set. Around forty songs altogether, which makes it a must for any ac/dc fan-- whether you're a diedhard or casual fan.  It's great to see Bon's performances in the early days, but there are no TV interviews with Bon Scott or the rest the ac/dc gang on the DVD. It's strictly perfomance clips.  Sure, it's the performances that are important, but alternative footage of the band would've rounded the DVD out nicely. Also the DVD is a bit pricey (It costs $40.00 Canadian!). Excellent (especially the ""Long Way to the Top' video). Highly recommended, but you must see AC/DC live in concert. One of the best live shows I've ever seen!",1112832000,,718,4.690476190476191

2233482,5,B0007R083A,"This is a Superb collection of Bon Scott Period Songs, and of Brian Johnson period Songs. The audio on both discs is superb beyond belief; if you have a 5.1  sound system, you will definitely want to blast this set, and it sounds crystal clear.
The Booklet is great, and the discs are layed in a case that does not hurt either disc, and is easy to remove and replace.
About the only things on the discs I feel like commenting on are Disc 1's , LONG WAY TO THE TOP, which is a great song with Melbourne, Australia as a backdrop ( so you can see what a rat-hole it is .. Great view of Trams, which have been superceded by dangerous models ). On disc 2, WHO MADE WHO has lots of duplicate Angus's... except that you can see that they look more like Weird Al  Yankovic in Angus's  Stage clothes rather than Angus Clones Per se.
Okay, there is one Singer that was around before Bon... and a Video of that song does exist; If I recall correctly, Bon did a superior version of the song later. So the statement that BABY PLEASE DON'T GO is some sort of Breakthrough  song for the Band is not especially true...and the song is,in the video version, as I had understood it at the time, a knock at the host of the TV show they appeared on at the time.
Anyways, this is a Great collection, hopefully  more will surface.",1112486400,2,1307,4.212
2233503,5,B0007R083A,"Some things never change and some things never should.  Both of these apply to ACDC who never compromised on the hard rockin' founding principles of the band. Angus once said ""We've written the same song 100 different times"". Fans would want it no other way.

Disc one includes all of the Bon Scott years with some extremely rare videos, promos(live performance with the studio track layed over the live video) and 'real' live performances of all the hits.  Worth the price of this set just to see Bon, Angus and the boys performing Long Way to the Top with all of their sound equiptment on the back of a flatbed truck tooling thru a crowded business district, accompanied by Bon and three other guys wearing kilts, all four of 'em playing on bagpipes!!  Priceless.  Long live Bon Scott.

Disc two is mainly MTV Videos with maybe three or four live performances and promos but still worthwile for some rarely seen vidoeos.

Don't hesitate to purchase this.  100 years from now people will still be listening to ACDC.  They are  among the top five most influential groups of all time and the 'meat and potatoes' of rock n roll music. Oy!!",1112486400,4,1137,4.64

2233507,5,B0007R083A,this is a must have dvd. i had goosebumps the whole time i watched it. i had to drive home for 45 minutes after buying the dvd. the longest 45 minutes of my life. raw acdc who could ask for more. i have seen acdc 17 times. since they have not toured lately this helps with my withdrawls. for $9.99-$14.99 you cant go wrong with 2 dvds packed with this much music. i almost felt guilty paying so little for so much. the only draw back is that it only goes to 1990. i would have liked to see some stiff upper lip tunes on here. an ultimate must have from the ultimate band!!!! ANGUS ANGUS ANGUS!!!!!!,1112140800,6,598,4.119658119658119
2233508,3,B0007R083A,"the dvd of acdc jewels is a nice representation of their video/live concerts.  the videos are historical and show a kinda ""WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET"".  watching BON SCOTT on screen is a confirmation of what kind of charisma he had on stage.  much of the music with bon to my thinking is more passionate then with brian.  the two singers are different and its nice that the band was able to carry on with the audiences approval.  if you want REAL concerts shot(get a ticket)but the videos are charming in their young age of tape/film.  I was able to see bon and company on stage back in 1976 or so--it was everything I wanted and hoped for.  the main reason I purchased it-is WALMART had it for less then 10 bucks for 2 dvds!!--not bad.  if you want to see bon and never had a chance--buy it and see what I am speaking about.  the quality of video/concerts on these dvd get progressively better(yrs+technology) as time goes on--but there will always be a love for garage quality amateurish shot film.  there is also a good sense of humor with the way the guitar playing and shot for shot-sometime were not in sinc-but that should not bother the total fans----however, if you are a guitar geek who wants accuracy-forget it.  ACDC is what they is and it shows in this compilation.  HEAD BANG IT",1112140800,3,1294,4.436440677966102
2233509,4,B0007R083A,"I have been an AC/DC fan for many years.  I bought this DVD, because I did not live in the Bon Scott era, and I wanted to see live performances with Bon Scott.  I was pretty happy with both DVDs.  I think they could have remastered the audio and video from the original master films so it would look better, but thats not a really bad thing.  Overall, if you like AC/DC, you may like this DVD.  Some of the videos can be seen online when you use the ConnecteD CD key on the reissued CDs.  I will rate this 4 stars.  This is a must-have for big AC/DC fans!",1112140800,,555,3.9909090909090907
2233510,3,B0007R083A,"The power and quality of the music is undeniable. What strikes me most about these discs (speaking of the US version) is how they went to great lengths to restore most of the early '70s clips then left the '79 and '80 release videos half-finished. Come on! Disc 1 ends with serious color problems (especially on Walk All Ove You) then Disc 2 opens with  artifacts all over the first moments of Hell's Bells.

There was obvious color correction of the '79 clips and they did a really good job for the most part, but they left the greens with ugly horizontal lines all over them. Why didn't they finish the job? It takes time, but its really not that hard with the right software.

I'm also suspicious with how dark those '79 and '80 promo clips are. its a quick and easy way to cover up flaws that you are too lazy to fix. I've been a fan since 1979 and already had most of the videos for years, I know those videos were not THAT dark originally.

All that said, its still worth $15 just for the early '70s videos.",1112054400,,1013,4.260416666666667
2233511,5,B0007R083A,"As I popped in disc one of this collection, my main concern was for how hollow the early songs might sound due to the age of the clips.  How wrong I was!  The sound quality on all of the songs/videos is absolutely amazing.  I was blown away by Riff Raff especially, because it is from the If You Want Blood... album that had no bass or depth on cd.  That is definitely not the case with the video.  The other nice thing about this collection is that there are no annoying interviews or documentaries.  Just pure, unadulterated power!  If you're contemplating getting this collection, don't think on it too long.  Just go get it.....NOW!",1112054400,5,636,4.517543859649122
2233512,5,B0007R083A,"I buy a lot of dvd's from a lot of rock bands,and I do admit that I have every VHS and dvd of AC/DC that is out there.  I even have a copy of Dave Evans singing ""Can I Sit Next To You Girl"" on VHS with the band. He was the infamous first singer before Bon Scott. No it does not have every song from the band, but what it does have is the best overview of any band I have ever seen on dvd. DVD One has everything you could want to hear from Bon Scott.  It's full of energy. It also shows you how this band matured from their early days in 1975 all the way to Bon's death only 10 days before.  DVD Two shows how this band remained popular even after Bon's tragedy with a sound which can only be AC/DC.  Brian Johnson was awesome when he started with this band and my mouth just dropped open during the songs from ""The Flick of the Switch"" album.  It also shows unfortunetly how this band did succumb to the video age by the mid-80's with their concept video ""Fly on the Wall.""  But what would this dvd be without showing all the clips which AC/DC made? Even that video has an entertaining value. Also the video's from ""Who Made Who""and ""Clipped are in this package. From beginning to end is how I watched it. And I found it to be a blast to watch. I did wish ""The Jack"" was on it, but this dvd did more than what any fan could ask for by presenting forty songs at a cheap price.

Don't worry fans about whether or not the movie ""Let There Be Rock"" will be out on dvd. It's just a hunch, but you just need to be patient.  Not one clip showed a scene from that movie. Which gives me an inclination that it can only be coming around the corner.  The song ""Walk All Over You"" from the movie would of made sense to put in this package, but I have a hunch we will see that song along with the whole perfomance they did in Paris on dvd.

Overall this dvd is a must buy not only for die-hard fans, but for any one with an interest in AC/DC.  Unlike the box set ""Bonfire,"" a fan with an interest will not be scared by the pricetag.  They'll end up buying this dvd and might possibly end up becoming a bigger fan. Especially when they see Bon Scott singing.
