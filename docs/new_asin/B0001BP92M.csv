If you're looking for a way to keep things interesting and involving, put on your best swing clothes, turn on the TV and get moving!  This DVD is fun, covers all angles and gets you dancing (and understanding swing culture) right away.",1262390400,,332,4.610169491525424
8009729,5,B0001BP92M,"Both swing dance newcomers and veteran Lindy hoppers can benefit greatly from this first-class video.

Co-instructor Rusty Frank has chosen moves that are easy to master, thanks to her articulate, friendly instruction and clear demonstrations from multiple angles.

The moves - a nice variety of six and eight count steps - are also great fun, and work without a hitch in the real world of social dancing.

Kudos also for the clever, fake-1930s newsreel that opens the tape - one more sign of Rusty and Peter's infectious enthusiasm for swing dancing, and the era that inspired it.",1099699200,4,581,4.969072164948454
