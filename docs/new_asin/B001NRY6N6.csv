3722759,5,B001NRY6N6,"There was only One Victor Borge, and there is likely never to be another with such a refined and outrageously funny presentation of Life, as seen through the eyes of a Thinking Man.  His ""Phonetic Punctuation"" is a Classic, and his Musical Presentations are a riot!  No matter how may times you will see it, you can't help but laugh, and laugh long and loud.",1356825600,7,358,4.492307692307692

3722762,3,B001NRY6N6,"Victor Borge as always is totally awesome and always entertaining.  Unfortunately I found the quality of the audio on this DVD very poor.  Even on highest volume it was hardly audible.  And this was not just my television.  I tried it also on a friend's new high def television and the audio was just as bad.  My 3 stars are soley because of the poor quality of the audio.  Borge always gets 5 stars!

3722763,4,B001NRY6N6,"I love Victor Borge.  I had the privilege to see him live in the early 1990's when I was a teenager, and it was truly one of the most memorable performances that I have ever witnessed.  What a magnificent performer, a truly brilliant pianist and a hysterical comedian!!

Unfortunately, this disc by PBS doesn't fully capture the magic of Borge.  It alternates back and forth from narrated documentary footage about his life to concert footage from throughout his career.  I was disappointed by the quality of some of the footage, particularly the audio from some of the earlier recordings.  And I was disappointed that so many of the clips were very truncated.  It resulted in a rather choppy and uneven experience.

To be fair, my family laughed a lot as we watched this disc.  Many of Borge's classic routines are included, and if you're unfamiliar with Borge, this would serve as a decent introduction.  The biographical information is interesting, and the concert footage is wonderful.  However, I would recommend straight concert footage such as ""The Best of Victor Borge Act One and Two"" instead to better capture the magic of Borge's genius.",1252454400,59,1148,4.927083333333333
