8424817,5,B000ZI59SU,"All three films have won awards at Cannes. I've seen two of the features and they're absolutely great (The Bothersome Man & Roads to Koktebel (also known as ""Koktebel"") - absorbing, beautifully shot indie films.

The Bothersome Man is an eerie Norwegian drama-comedy, with delightful humor and great performances. Roads to Koktebel is a movie by Russian duo Popogrebskiy & Khlebnikov, incredibly moving story of a journey taken by father and son, and the journey they take to come to know and understand each other. Both directors went on to make their own films later on and Popogrebskiy's latest feature, How I Spent This Summer, has just won numerous awards at the festivals. Film Movement's website says it'll be released this winter - can't wait.

Going back to the boxed set features, I'm curious to see Raja - it raised quite a bit of controversy when it was released.

All in all, I think that would make a perfect present/addition to the collection for anyone who likes independent foreign cinema.",1292976000,,1006,4.905882352941177
