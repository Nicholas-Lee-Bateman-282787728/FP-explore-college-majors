3802792,4,B001ULAUF8,I am shocked to be saying that Uwe Boll's Tunnel Rats is an absolute gem of a war movie. I usually find Boll's movies laughable but not only did this movie capture the hell and absurdity of war but it did it from both the American and Viet Cong point of view. The tunnel scenes were amazing and if you are claustrophobic you will have a real tough time with this. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. Some surprisingly good acting and dialogue made this movie not only a rental for me but I will also be purchasing it for my collection.,1251331200,,544,4.046296296296297
3802793,2,B001ULAUF8,"This movie is stuck between horror film and war drama (Mel Gibson?). Im not sure who I would recommend this movie to since its genre is not definite, perhaps people who want to see people go down into holes or watch people get blown up and shot.

I thought that after the poor attempt at dialogue that seemed forced and ill contrived, maybe it would turn into a decent film. As I continued I was thinking that it would be in the gothic tradition, a horror film, where the instead of a disfigured hellish slayer the nemesis would be the tunnel itself (for both factions). If that had been the case it would have been a good movie. But instead the story itself was about the action, and plenty of there was. But it was meaningless senseless violence; the viewer never gets to connect with any of the characters to where the violence is somehow meaningful. All the work that went into this movie goes to show... Its ALL ABOUT THE SCRIPT!!! And though functional (i.e. person has learned how to write screenplay), the script is far from thoughtful, original, or even entertaining. And it shows in the final product, the movie.",1247184000,2,1122,4.554455445544554
3802794,1,B001ULAUF8,"What a waste of time.  What was the point of this film?  As a 20 plus year Vet, I was insulted by this piece of garbage.  Did they not hire a military advisor? My 6 year old knows more about being a solder than the director and the entire cast of this film.
Unfortunately a good movie set doesn't make up for poor acting and an ""In Your Face"" anti American propaganda laden movie.  Did anyone catch the dumb blood thirsty American vs. the noble downtrodden peasants who are only protecting their families slants to the film?
I know and understand that there are two sides / point of view in a war. Each side believes they are in the right and the other side in the wrong. No problem with a director portraying this in an accurate manor. What this film does is portray the US solder as a stupid blood thirsty robot or a weak weenie. But who cares, everyone dies! And I mean everyone...how stupid...
 I can't wait to ask my Dad who was a real Tunnel Rat what he thought of this move...",1246924800,7,983,4.235294117647059
3802795,3,B001ULAUF8,"Uwe Boll is the kind of director that you can't help but love to hate.  No matter how many universally panned films he makes, he just keeps going, and keeps churning them out one right after the other, and we still keep watching them.  Personally, there's nothing I like better than to have a laugh at one of a number of Uwe's trainwrecks (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne; c'mon, you know the list), but lately, the master of error has churned out some flicks that actually haven't been half bad with Postal and Seed.  Tunnel Rats falls into this category as well, as this time around Uwe steps away from the video game adaptation world and focuses on a too often forgotten part of the Vietnam war, of which tunnel digging played a pivotal role in.  Boll favorite Michael Pare stars as the lieutenant of a group of these soldiers, as Boll offers a bleak and unflinching look at the Vietnam war.  What it lacks in terms of characterizations, Tunnel Rats more than makes up for in keeping the viewer compelled, which is a small miracle in itself.  Not to mention that Boll has a keen eye for carnage here, even if the camerawork and editing isn't always as good as one may hope.  Still, by the time the end credits roll, you'll probably be left thinking just what was the point of the whole thing, but at the same time, Tunnel Rats remains a surprisingly solid, violent, and gritty war flick that is worth giving a shot.",1246579200,7,1435,4.4541984732824424
3802796,2,B001ULAUF8,I am giving the movie 2 stars only because of the body count and action. Spoiler alert: Where was the perimeter of defense for the base camp? Where were the trip wires and claymores? The enemy literally walked in and began slaughter. Why would they enter the tunnels with their pistol over their head and not in front of them? The producer/director could and should have used a military technical advisor. As a 40 year military and police veteran in my oipinion the tactics were totally wrong and suicidal.,1246579200,4,506,4.696629213483146
3802797,1,B001ULAUF8,"I do not jump on the bandwagon either way on Uwe's work, if there is a good film I will review it accordingly. Simply, this was a painfully tedious tunnel film, beginning to end. Will try cover in this two sections: film and features.

As far as the film goes, there was an earnest attempt at recreating the tunnels, jungle isolation and military equipment. The tedious amount of character discussion leading up to the tunnel infiltration can be a killer (32 minutes of it before the first lid is popped), then you have to stomach over 48 minutes of crawling, digging, repetitively bad writing and a non-existent command structure. There are several outdoor battle scenes quite reminiscent of Predator in the amount of M-60s being swung around one-handed, with believability made even more absent as soldiers stand by as they are blown up by their own planes (for a couple minutes mind you - I figure they should have run after the 1st bomb, or maybe the 20th, but anyway...).

The special features contain some nice tidbits for Uwe fans. There is a 14 minute interview of Uwe stating his reasons why the US lost the war in Vietnam and why the film exists. A 10 minute making-of details the thinking and locations of this film (the tunnels were actually all on a stage - not in the jungle as stated by another reviewer here). The best material comes in the form of Uwe and the other actors admitting there was no script - they all wrote their own parts and winged the whole thing. 6 minutes of rightfully deleted scenes rounds out the last feature.

A couple more things - Uwe states that the soldiers are ""responsible for the war"" and on more than one occasion stands by his questionable feeling that the main reason the US lost the war was because of the tunnels only...hmmm. BIG SPOILER: the worst part of this whole mess was the entire film becomes pointless when every single person from both sides is killed - makes you feel like the whole time investment in any character was moot.

Once more - I am not a hater of Uwe, but this was a very long, boring, poorly written production.",1246320000,26,2087,4.557333333333333
3802798,5,B001ULAUF8,"This is an awesome movie in every way.  Even you Uwe Boll haterz (Robert below) will like it, if you don't know he directed it.

3802799,5,B001ULAUF8,"I know that there is significant controversy regarding Uwe Boll films, but personally I find them very, very entertaining.

3802800,1,B001ULAUF8,"Tunnel Rats (Uwe Boll, 2008)

Someone, I forget who, once postulated that the idea of gratuitous sex and violence in movies simply doesn't exist; no matter how tenuous, it's always justified by the plot, even in porn films. And to some extent I agree with that assessment; ""gratuitous"" is a word that puts me in mind of the judicial definition of ""obscene"" in that the strictures one must adhere to when using the term are well-nigh impossible to achieve. And yet there is the work of Uwe Boll, which defines gratuitous in every possible way. With Tunnel Rats, Boll has sunk to a new low, even for him. I had hoped that, when directing something that wasn't a videogame adaptation, he might improve a bit. And Seed wasn't completely terrible. But this time, Boll and lead actor Michael Pare team up for the worst movie each has done to date. And that's saying something for both of them.

Tunnel Rats follows a platoon in Vietnam (headed by Pare's insane sergeant). You'll recognize a lot of what they go through from Platoon, from which Tunnel Rats borrows liberally. I'm sure it will come as no surprise to the discerning Uwe Boll fan, however, that these characters pack absolutely none of the emotional punch of Platoon, as ham-handed as Oliver Stone was throughout most of its length. The script isn't just stupid, it's aggressively stupid; during the interminable opening half-hour, in which nothing of consequence occurs, there's a scene during which two veterans spend five minutes talking about how people who spend too much time talking in Vietnam get killed. I'm sure that in Uwe Boll's world, that's some subtle form of foreshadowing. Hopefully everyone else recognizes it for the stupidity it really is.

It's rare that I find myself offended that I actually spent the entire length of a movie watching it; if it's really that bad, I'll turn it off at whatever point it starts to make my head ache. I've done that no more than a dozen times in my life. And I didn't do it with Tunnel Rats, though I can't for the life of me imagine why. This is the worst movie I've seen in years. It attempts to be emotionally manipulative and fails. How pathetic is that? (zero)",1242950400,11,2176,4.69109947643979
3802801,4,B001ULAUF8,"I had the pleasure of viewing Tunnel Rats at the US premier in Los Angeles December 2008 with Michael Pare and the supporting cast attending.  The jungle and tunnel photography was impressive, and the young soldiers pain and fear seemed very real.  Filmed in the jungles of South Africa it was not a ""set"" location!  As with all Viet Nam era stories it is emotional, bloody, and heartwrenchingly sad to see the circumstances and ultimate results of war.  It's a keeper for me!",1240531200,8,476,4.698795180722891

3802818,3,B001ULAUF8,"I)  The structure of the military elements were a little off.  Some of the sceen structure was not what we as infantry in Vietnam would have constructed, ie: the base camp would never had been constructed in a dense jungle enviroment.
  The tunnel sceens were quit accurate in construction.  But never would all of one unit been killed off in a tunnel complex.  Nor would some of the laclusture for safety been ignored.  Tooo much Rambo in the acting.
2)  The action effects were awesome.  I would like to have been an advisor to some points in the film (I was a Tunnel Rat for the 25th Div.)  The film potrayed Tunnel Rats in a good and depressed manor. We wern't heros or Rambo, just guys doing an unwanted job that seemed exciting at the time.  I think most of us were stupid and took unecessary risks because of our youth and inexperience in life.  The film potryed that as well.  Good job.
3)  I would recommend the film with a side remark that it is an exploited view of reality in war.  A commentary from actual Tunnel Rats at the end of the movie would have been an interresting oppertunity ti validate the movie better.",1356825600,4,1128,4.407766990291262
3802819,3,B001ULAUF8,"I ordered this dvd for my ROTC class. It was a term project, and I have to say that I was pleased that the dvd came very quickly which helped me get my project done earlier. The packaging was good, protected the dvd, and the dvd itself (meaning the cd) was in great condition. Not much to it really, it had the casing and the cd in it. That was all good and well, however the movie itself is just a whole other story.

The movie was badly directed, the actors were okay I guess. I can't really say anything more about it because I couldn't understand what was being said most of the time. The plot was entirely confusing and practically just non existent. It's a gory movie, so I definitely would advise not to watch it if you're a squeamish type over blood and murder. However I must say that it served it's purpose of showing me what the Vietnam war was really like, but it definitely had room for improvement, A LOT of improvement.

All in all, the item was great, but the actual movie itself was bad. Thus I dub it good but bad. I would recommend buying this product out of necessity, such as for a class. Definitely do not buy for just movie purposes because you will be very disappointed.",1345248000,2,1194,4.278761061946903
3802820,2,B001ULAUF8,"Tunnel Rats is a Vietnam war film by Uwe Boll. I'm not an Uwe Boll hater, but this film just doesn't hit the target. ( I do recommend you watch Uwe Boll's Rampage and Darfur though.) The acting was mostly bad from most of the actors; a lot of overacting and some dull dialogue. The special effects were also bad during the war scenes or when people got shot in general. Also, it didn't really tell a direct story, I couldn't tell if it was telling the American or Vietnamese  story because it doesn't really bother to develop characters or clearly develop the conflict. The tunnel scenes were claustrophobic and slightly exciting, though. And I did like the atmosphere it built. It did go by fast so the packing was great.

Overall, I don't recommend buying this film. If you have Netflix Streaming, it is available as of 7/1/12 if you want to check it out.

If your reading this, I'm more than sure that you've read other more comprehensive reviews, so I won't go into detail. I do have have one major thing to say about this movie, one thing that nagged at me so much that I had to turn away during alot of the scenes; the complete lack of accuracy or fighting spirit in the American soldiers. It seemed to me to be just a HUGE shooting barrel for the VC. The only real kills made by the U.S. forces, were those either in a last ditch death effort i.e. holding a grenade to their chests, or barely getting in that final shot off while falling. Or that super intimate face to face struggle kill.

3802827,1,B001ULAUF8,"I did a year with the Air Cav in 1966-67. I've seen most Vietnam movies. The Tunnel Rats is without doubt the worst of the lot. I can only assume no one connected with the production ever set foot in country, read a book about Vietnam, watched a movie about Vietnam nor did any research into the war - even the basic technical details of their above ground base camp were completely wrong and looked more like a Boy Scout camp in Wisconsin.

The major tunnel systems began in Cambodia and Laos; the networks extended for 100's of kilometers and you certainly didn't crawl the entire distance. Some systems were so well developed there were roads complete with mechanical workshops, hospitals, barracks and substantial warehouses. While there were limited numbers of small ""neighborhood"" tunnel systems as depicted in this movie the majority were similar to those shown in the movie We Were Soldiers.

This movie sucked!!!",1296086400,20,921,4.897435897435898
3802828,4,B001ULAUF8,"In 1968 Tunnel Rats (2008), director Uwe Boll shines a light on a facet of the Viet Nam conflict that is not generally recognized, the tunnel systems in the Cu Chi district of Saigon, Viet Nam, and the ""tunnel rats"", soldiers whose mission was to investigate tunnels, and clear them of any enemy personnel.  Though actual conditions were much worse, the film does a reasonably good job of conveying some sense of what this terrifying duty may have involved.  Taking you into close fitting tunnels, where soldiers with just a flashlight, a knife, and a pistol, face the possibility of horrific death deep underground.

Tunnel systems apparently began in Viet Nam in the 1940's, and became more sophisticated, after the Americans arrived and the conflict intensified.  The complex tunnels at Cu Chi, were used by the Viet Cong as places of refuge, and also by the civilian populace, as places to live.  Following circuitous routes, tunnels systems could be very complicated, and were often booby trapped.  Large caverns where people could stand upright were also constructed.  Usually deep below the surface, these spaces served as living areas, medical treatment areas, and even schools.  1968 Tunnel Rats features some of these aspects, but really provides just a tip of an iceberg's view, of how elaborate some of these systems really were.

The bulk of the action takes place during a single day, as a squad of tunnel rats is deployed from their jungle basecamp, and finds a tunnel opening while on patrol.  The squad proceeds to investigate, and very shortly encounters a strong enemy presence, when a soldier is graphically skewered with a bamboo pole.  After being attacked by the enemy, what remains of the squad takes refuge in the tunnels.  What happens below ground may seem a little surreal, as the brutal gut level tunnel warfare is not what most are accustomed to, as when one soldier trapped between two dead bodies, must cut his way out.  While the ""rats"" are exploring the tunnels, the US camp is under a full scale attack.  The wild scenes of conventional battle, contrasts with the in close fighting underground.

Among many things discussed in the director's commentary track, Boll was seeking to make a statement about the futility of war.  The film was set in 1968 because he believes it was an extremely significant period in time.  And the enemy's use the tunnels was a key factor in the US failing to achieve victory, thus making this an important subject to examine.

Uwe Boll is a much maligned filmmaker, which may lead some to dismiss any project he is associated with.  While his view regarding the nature of war may not be entirely cogent, he does deserve some credit for exploring this subject, and incorporating realistic elements.  While the film is graphic and at times extreme, Boll could easily have made things even more gory or brutal.  With a cast of mostly unknowns (save for Michael Pare), and often working from an improvised script, the film doesn't escape being clichd or manipulative in some respects, however there is still much about it that is thought provoking, impactful, and insightful.  Conflict at its most basic level, is about survival, not ideology.

Boll's commentary with director of photography Mathias Neumann, is a little rambling, but covers many key points.  It is evident that due to past criticism, Boll is a little defensive at times, and hoping that people will give this film a chance.  War isn't about happy endings, and even the ""victors"" usually suffer great losses.  That sometimes there are no winners, would seem to be one of the key points of the film.

Parts of the Cu Chi tunnels are today, popular tourist attractions.  Those interested in learning more, may want to investigate Tom Mangold's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tunnels-of-Cu-Chi-A-Harrowing-Account-of-America-s-Tunnel-Rats-in-the-Underground-Battlefields-of-Vietnam/dp/0891418695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tunnels of Cu Chi: A Harrowing Account of America's ""Tunnel Rats"" in the Underground Battlefields of Vietnam</a>&nbsp;one the leading references on the subject.",1282348800,14,4165,5.279210925644916
3802829,3,B001ULAUF8,"First of all, this is NOT one of dear Uwe's video game movies. He released a promotional title to go along with it, but this was one of his original ideas. This shows, because like most of his 'originals', it's a good premise with poor execution. Really, calling it, 'bad', is almost pointless, because unless otherwise noted, one can just assume and Uwe movie is bad. The question? Is it entertaining?

First, this is one of Boll's earlier experiment with the 'Improvisation Method'. This is a film-making technique where a plot outline and character outline is given to each actor, and they improvise all dialogue. In some Boll movies like 'Rampage', this works very well. In '1968: Tunnel Rats'? Not so much. Michael Pare is very good for a B-list actor, and he pulls it off. Almost everyone else however, is a stuttering mess.

The action is decent as far as Uwe's movies go, but it's very sub-par if you don't know what to expect. If action or story is what you're going in for, I'd back away from this one, but if what you want is an over-the-top exploitation film, dive right in.

Basically, it's an Uwe Boll movie. It's not especially bad, nor is it surprisingly good. Boll fans? give it a watch. All others? better rent it, or borrow a friend's copy first, make sure it's your thing.",1281916800,,1292,4.584415584415584

3802831,1,B001ULAUF8,"Veterans are the toughest customers for war films.  The military teaches attention to detail, and therefore we're very picky about that when it comes to movies made about our profession.  After watching it I skimmed the credits and found no mention of a military advisor being used for this film(but then that was pretty obvious).

There were many things wrong with the American soldiers' uniforms and gear(name tapes of a type I've never seen, 30 round M16 mags when the only issued were 20 round mags, incorrect web gear, incorrect rucksacks, incorrect rank, the list goes on).  The VC seemed to be carrying chinese AK's chambered in 5.56(judging by the magazine shape(which is very wrong, it would have been 7x39 AK's) and generally they didn't wear helmets.  I don't think the film maker understood the distinction between VC and NVA.

Then comes the fighting.  That the Americans keep sending soldiers in the tunnel few by few until they're all dead makes no sense.  Neither does the fact that the soldiers at the tunnel entrence pulled no outward security(instead sat smoking cigarettes and talking).  I doubt very much that I'd want to jump into a VC tunnel rather than fight it out above ground.  The fight at the patrol base was the most ridiculous part.  The base seemed to be a random collection of tents scattered in the middle of the jungle in a horrendously undefensible arrangement.  Then when the attack came the Americans basically ran around and flailed their arms while the VC massacred them.  I also liked that the lueitenant(who was way to old to be that rank) called in an airstrike that didn't start dropping bombs until later that night(it would probably happen within 10-15 minutes).  Even if you didn't have a military advisor, simply asking yourself 'does this make any sense at all?' would have corrected the majority of these issues.]

I guess I should have expected all of this from a CANDADIAN film about an AMERICAN war.  Avoid this film like the plague.",1273795200,31,1986,4.8486646884272995
3802832,3,B001ULAUF8,"While this movie may not have had the budget as films such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, this was actually a better movie than some of these reviews might suggest.  I can't help but to read between the lines of the negative reviews, the American Patriotic fervor that cannot handle films depicting anything other than that ""we are the best"" bravado mentality and we NEVER lose.

This appears to be a fairly accurate depiction of a specific aspect of the Vietnam war and from that which is much more of a drama based film.  If you want to see a dramatic and fairly accurate movie you'll probably enjoy this.  If you're looking for the 'American Military that always Kick A**' that never loses a battle, then you might want to pass on this one.",1272758400,5,745,4.496296296296296

3802834,1,B001ULAUF8,"I won't tell you how it ends, because I could not stomach the movie for more than 28 minutes.
It looked to me like a poorly done high school production of ""hey kids, lets make a war movie"".
When I read that there was no script, that all the lines were improve, it explained a lot.
No plot, no direction, no character build, all in all a terrible waste of time and film.
Please, Please, do not waste even a Netfilx space on the tripe.",1261440000,5,433,4.105882352941176
3802835,1,B001ULAUF8,"First off very little or no education of the Vietnam war was researched by the director. To have no script is as legit as a high school play. Movies with titles like these should demand research especially to those actual tunnel rats that served!!
  Continued flaws were the clothes the Viet Cong had on. Nowhere were clothes like the vietcong soldiers of purple and black ever worn. Also the helmets were so not actual it was more like a bikers helmet.
  I viewed this movie with my father and he was actually swearing at the tv and yelling ""who the heck does this director think he is? This is a shame and insult to all the American tunnel rats that served.""  I do want to say I censored what he said..... I was much worse.
  Shame on you uwe boll. You took a fantastic potential for a good movie and made it into a lame straight to dvd situation.

  Whats even better is I had my friends father, former Arvan solidier.  Arvns fought with the USA. He watched it and said that even the NVA and Vietcong would spit on this outrage as he had.
  The plot or whatever it was was a joke. To have everyone die just put the cherry on top of this disaster of a movie.  NEVER BUY THIS!!!
I would give this a minus star if I could. Also Amazon should give back my fathers money for buying that!!!!  This dvd went straight to the trash!!!",1261008000,,1328,4.235059760956175

Well, this film was a total surprise.  Good acting, good script, good music, etc.  It covers a section of the Vietnam war seldom seen and I don't care how accurate it was, it still got you involved.  The bottom line of this film is that everyones loses in war.",1255651200,,402,4.306666666666667

3802839,1,B001ULAUF8,"Totally bizarre, clumsily plotted, the attention to detail (there is none), special effects (lame), any sort of real acting (zero & there was no script). I think I saw a paint ball gun in a few of the scenes. If I really looked at the cover & saw the Blackhawk. I should have known better. I don't know who the director is & I don't care. Uwe Boll received a rare ""Worst Career Achievement"" award at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards on February 21, 2009 for 1968 Tunnel Rats. I never thought I should have to google a movie before I rent it. Okay, I lost an hour and a half of my time (which I can't get back). I just want my money back.

If you have a family member who served during the Vietnam War...don't rent or buy this!

* I forgot to add - the place where I had the misfortune to rent this. They gave me a refund, and a free rental for another movie. They said ""I wasn't the only person who they gave a refund for this movie"".",1254787200,4,934,4.070652173913044
3802840,1,B001ULAUF8,"WTF WTF WTF!  From the lines of ""Tropic Thunder"" - ""You $#!T the money bag my friend!""  I direct that to UB.  STOP MAKING your favorite VIDEO GAMES into movies! Especially if you are doing the writing or are helping in anyway shape or form!  Ok! Got that out of my system.

Time for the actual review...C R A P! Double C R A P!! TRIPPPLE C R A P!!!  IT""S ""TROPIC THUNDER"" THE REAL MOVIE - the only thing missing is ""BOOTY SWEAT""! THE DIRECTOR IS AN SOB and he should be put out of his misery and just ""brained""  - I mean full on lobotomy!  Because in that state, he can use the excuse that that is why is movies are about as on par as wanting a third testicle in all of you children, including the girls.  This movie was bad in terms of the acting, the editing, and the ""costumes???"" Where did they get the crap that they were using to dress these guys?!?  The US grunts look like they stepped out of a ""Dickies"" store.  The VC looked like they robbed the set of ""Taegukgi"" (Which was a better made/directed/designed movie about the Korean War - and it was done by a non-western director!)

UB does another fantastically outlandish and over the top look at a very serious and dedicated group of men - who were considered to be very elite in what they did.  That being the pursuit of VC and North Vietnamese Soldiers that used tunnels to hide, travel, and transport goods.  Not to mention the fact that many of these tunnels were rigged in more intricate patterns to confuse and even kill the US soldiers pursuing the ""Commis"".  UB attempted to show this, but utterly failed.  It was laughable in that I have seen graduate film students that have made better movies using a camera picked up at Wal-mart and the wardrobe department from their sister's basements.  This was BAD! Not in a good way...not even in a ""I'll sit through this to throw popcorn at the screen""-bad.  This was the TEN MEGATON nuclear bomb of movies.  Watch at your own discretion!  Lastly, to show how much care UB - ""the TARD"" cares about his movie (all things included)- the DVD cover and his movie poster that promo-ed his movie show UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters coming in above the guy getting shot (or ""taking a dump in pain"") - either way it looks like the cover of ""Platoon"" with ""Blackhawk Down"" pics photo-shopped into the header!

Whoever gave UB money for this should have taken out a mob-hit to get their money back!",1251849600,3,2397,4.402272727272727
3802841,1,B001ULAUF8,"So far, I've watched 2 movies directed by UWE BOLL. They're  Bloodrayne and Tunnel Rats. Bloodrayne is bad but this one is worse.

The only thing that is accurate is the tunnels. Most of the sections are just big enough to fit one person. And he must crawl. He can't stand or sit in it. Only when he arrives at the main compartment, then it will become as big as a room. That room can hold many people. That's exactly what the tunnels are in reality. They're amazing achievements. They can withstand bombings from air raids. You can read more about them in ""The Tunnels of Cu Chi"" by Tom Mangold and John Penycate. The ISBN is 0425089517.

All the other aspects of this movie are bad and inaccurate.
For example, the helmets of the Viet Cong soldiers in the films are completely different with the real ones. You can see the real ones in films like ""Hamburger Hill"". Viet Cong's helmets in this movie look like Thai soldiers' or some other countries'.

The acting and the fighting scenes are terribly bad and boring. As Steve Kuehl, another reviewer, stated in his comment here ""In the special features of this DVD, Uwe and the other actors admitting there was no script - they all wrote their own parts and winged the whole thing."" How good can a film be without a script?

The cover of this DVD reads ""Tunnel Rats. Hell is for Heroes"". It should have read ""Tunnel Rats. Hell is for Bad Movies"". I'LL NEVER WATCH a  MOVIE directed  by UWE BOLL again.",1251504000,2,1451,4.452830188679245
