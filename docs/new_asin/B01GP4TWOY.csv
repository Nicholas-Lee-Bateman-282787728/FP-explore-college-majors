8763263,4,B01GP4TWOY,"It is been a while since I've seen the steam. I had some misconceptions about why they failed and broke up. This explained it quite clearly. Furthermore, hearing from Penny and shack explain behind the scene matters was quite entertaining for an old school NBA fan.  I always judge  NBA documentaries by how well they handle the playoffs, that's usually where the action is, I thought there could've been a little bit more but they did handle and explain Nick Anderson's role quite well in the first defeat and then decline in 1994-1995 NBA finals.",1482710400,,548,4.757894736842105
8763264,4,B01GP4TWOY,"I think Shaquille O'Neal is one of the biggest egomaniacs of all retired pro athletes.  Everything he talks about, in some way, has to include himself.  He even has photos of himself in every intro to his Shaqtin' a Fool highlights, like he has anything to do with the highlights, other than picking them.  Well before this film was ever released, Shaq was talking quite a bit about ""what could have been"" in regards to his days with the Orlando Magic, which leads me to seriously believe that Shaq probably went to Espn 30 for 30 producers to ask that this film be made about himself.  The film itself?  Still very good, although they still try to sneak in quick little video and audio clips from other games, and in some cases even other seasons, in order to have a more dramatic effect on the game or moment they are highlighting at the time.
The Magic were one of the best teams of that era, no doubt, but let's not go overboard.  Penny Hardaway can't resist the chance to join so many others in recent years, like members of the '96 Sonics and the '94 and '95 Rockets, to claim that they could have beaten the '96 Bulls, which is considered by many to be the greatest NBA team of all-time.  Hardaway suggests that had Nick Anderson made his free throws in Game 1 of the Finals, Orlando would have beaten Houston in the '95 Finals, and then ""would have had the confidence"" to beat the 72-win '96 Bulls the following year ""for sure"" in the playoffs.  A pretty bold statement coming from a team that went 0-8 against the '95 Rockets and '96 Bulls during their playoff runs against them.  Horace Grant goes on to suggest that had Shaq not left, Orlando would have won at least 3 or 4 championships.  Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda.  They still would have had to play Chicago for two more seasons and by that time Penny Hardaway's injury problems had already started.  And as far as Shaq's playoff runs in the '90s go:  swept by Indiana in '94, swept by Houston in '95, swept by Chicago in '96, nearly swept by Utah in '97 (they lost 4 games to 1), swept by Utah in '98, and swept by San Antonio in '99.  Yeah, Shaq was a great center, but he didn't truly begin to ""dominate"" until Olajuwon, Ewing and D. Robinson were all close to retirement.
Entertaining and definitely worth a view.  But remember to keep things in perspective while listening to Shaq and co. retell history.",1482710400,2,2370,4.441108545034642

8763266,1,B01GP4TWOY,"The documentary is great
But I received a burnt DVD with a ""self-printed"" cover
To be clear I received a bootlegged DVD and it was mentionned nowhere on the page.......",1475452800,,168,4.633333333333334
8763267,5,B01GP4TWOY,"If you were a fan of the Orlando Magic, Penny Hardaway, Shaq, 90's NBA basketball fan, or all the above, you'll love this gripping film that shows how Orlando got their franchise, how they seemed to have a title or two locked up, and then the pain that came when tragedy struck the small market team.",1467849600,,300,4.375
