8576691,5,B00C2TUF2U,"Elia Kazan brought out the best in actors and actresses who appeared in the 19 films he directed between 1945 and 1976. Like Sidney Lumet he was an ""actor's director"" and his films were nominated for an astounding 58 Oscars during his career, 21 of those for the acting only. He is the only director to have directed Garfield, Clift, Brando, Dean, and De Niro the actors best known for ""the Method"". Two other actors who actually won Oscars were James Dunn and Anthony Quinn, both of whose performances are showcased in Volume Two of Fox's ""Kazan at Fox"". Let me say right up front that the Blu-ray quality for all four films in this set are superb with some being nearly pristine. The restoration team at Fox deserves lots of credit once again for making these films look brand new. The first film is the rarely seen ""MAN ON A TIGHTROPE""(1953) which Kazan made before ""On the Waterfront""(1954). It's about a traveling circus headed by Fredric March and the problems the performers encounter while under the communist regime of post-war Czechoslovakia. It's a message film about the absurdities of the communist bureaucracy(March is interrogated about his clown routine during a show) but holds your interest until the exciting finish. Fredric March, Terry Moore, Richard Boone and the great Gloria Grahame give terrific performances. The Video Quality(Aspect ratio: 1.33.1) is superb throughout. There is some slight film damage(white vertical lines) toward the end but if you blink you'll miss them. The Audio(English Mono DTS-HD Master audio) is exceptional. ""Man on a Tightrope"" is 105 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. There are no special features. ""A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN""(1945) was Kazan's first film and is a revelation on Blu-ray. This heartwarming coming of age story is simply one of the best films you'll ever see due in no part by the tremendous performances by Dorothy McGuire, James Dunn(Oscar Winner) and most of all Peggy Ann Garner who holds the film together by her wonderful performance as ""Francie"" the oldest daughter who dreams of a better life amid the terrible tenement life of Brooklyn. The Video Quality(Aspect ratio: 1.33.1) is a marvel to behold and the film has never looked better than it does in it's Blu-ray debut. I can't say enough about the quality of this film and hopefully Fox will release it in the future as a stand alone Blu-ray. The Audio(English Mono DTS-HD Master audio) is crystal clear, so much so that you'll actually believe you're living on the streets in front of the Irish tenements. ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is 129 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. There are a lot of special features including a ""Making of"" Documentary and a feature on Dorothy McGuire. ""VIVA ZAPATA!""(1952) is the most well known film and follows the last few years of the Mexican hero Emiliano Zapata, played in a terrific performance by Marlon Brando. John Steinbeck wrote the script and Kazan gets the most out of his actors. In addition to Brando, Anthony Quinn(Oscar winner), Jean Peters and Joseph Wiseman are exceptional. The Video Quality(Aspect ratio: 1.33.1) is once again, simply outstanding. Locations and indoor sets are crystal clear and this is the best I've ever seen ""Zapata"" looking in a long time. The Audio(English Master Mono DTS-HD Master audio) is outstanding with dialogue being exceptionally clear and free of noise. ""Viva Zapata!"" is 113 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH and Spanish only. There are no special features. ""Viva Zapata! is also available as a stand alone Blu-ray from Fox. The fourth and last film is ""WILD RIVER""(1960) and is the only film in this set that is in color(by Deluxe). Montgomery Clift plays a TVA agent trying to evacuate people from the land in the Tennessee Valley to make way for a new dam. Filmed on location in Tennessee, Kazan once again makes the characters portrayed by Clift, Jo Van Fleet and Lee Remick seem real(look for a young Bruce Dern in some scenes). The Video Quality(Aspect ratio: widescreen 2.35:1) is once again exceptional. The color cinematography is a wonder on Blu-ray and very detailed. You can even ""feel"" the rain in some scenes. The Audio(English Master Mono DTS-HD Master audio and Spanish Mono) is equally outstanding. ""Wild River"" is 110 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. There are no special features. ""Wild River"" is also available as a stand alone Blu-ray from Fox. Those are the four Blu-ray films for Volume Two. Elia Kazan was one of the great directors in cinema and the eight Blu-ray films that make up Volumes One and Two of ""Kazan at Fox"" should be essential to any home film library. They both come highly recommended.",1389052800,8,4802,4.9664596273291925
