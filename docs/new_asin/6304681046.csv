Altough it has good roots,Todd Sheets have talent,entusiasm,we see in the future. It has pretty gory scenes,but there is thousands of untold answers. As I say,we will see in the future,Todd...",1003017600,,310,4.7592592592592595
8188785,4,6304681046,"OK, so this one has plot parts from Demons, and it takes place in a theater, but that is where the similarities in this delerious movie stop. It is really pretty good in a b-movie way. I like the creepy place it is filmed and I like the effects, though they are pretty low budget. A head tearing is actually pretty funny and gross at the same time. There is some great suspence in it, and the story is actually kind of involved once it gets rolling. Original? NO.  Enteraining? YES.
Another fine, fun movie from our favorite shock master.",982368000,,538,4.38
