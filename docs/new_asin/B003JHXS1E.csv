This movie's weakness---its favoritism towards one side of the case---is also its strength, as that side is so obviously in the legal and moral right here. Barnes wanted his insanely fine modern art collection left as it was, to be used mainly as a school. He took much care in setting it up as a uniquely low key semi-museum that showed these works in the venue and manner that he chose, and he wanted it that way in perpetuity. Part of that desire was clearly to snub the idiots who ran the Philly Museum of Art, who derided his collection when they hadn't yet been informed---by people who actually knew something about art---that they should like this art.

Art Of The Steal is the tale of their heirs' obviously conspiratorial revenge against Barnes, for having been so right about both his collection and their apparently infinite greed, stupidity, and phoniness. Modern sleazeball heirs of older sleazeball fortunes, like the gangster-money Annenbergs and the hilariously/painfully Machiavellian Becky Rimel, merge here with newly minted sleazy politicians like Bernie Watson, ""Judge"" Ott, Ricky Glanton, and other patently paid off workers of the political system of Philly, which looks to be about as honest as Chicago's. They all see The Main Chance for their careers and bank accounts, and the best part is how they posit themselves as saviors of the public good while robbing the Barnes Foundation and Lincoln University blind. (And surprise! The 1998 audit that claimed the BF was broke, conveniently ignoring their endless ways to generate cash, was by Deloitte Touche, the slippery Brit accountants heavily linked to so many bailout scams and also to Sotheby's, the art world's greatest crooks.)

An examination of the wiki about the BF is telling; they've sanitized that sucker down to the ground, just as they no doubt paid off Ott and Watson and Steele with promises of endless campaign contributions and entree into the elite circles of botox-frozen phonies that dot the Philly low society we see on display here. Their machinations have taken decades to play out; they've been planning this for generations, clearly.

Because, really!? How DARE Barnes know SO much more about art than them, and be so clearly in the right then and now? How DARE he leave his priceless collection  to a small, liberal black college? (Well, priceless until the Pews need to apply for charitable status and suddenly are conservators of the Barnes which they estimate at ""above 25 to 30 billion dollars"" in worth). How DARE he take away from the old Philly money (grubbers) what is rightfully theirs...except by any fair legal or moral reckoning?

But even the slant of this doc can't overstate the sheer greed and sneakiness and duplicity of these weasels. It boggles the mind, but it's just business as usual: politicians bought off by big money and everybody claiming it's for the public good. The way Glanton used the apparently moronic reporter Fleeson to his ends is quite something as well (though of course she was working for the Annenbergs' newspaper, and you just know Perelman had his grubby little paws in there too; he's a real pearl, no doubt). Everybody wants to be a ""star"" for a day or a week or whatever....but never thinks about how they'll appear to posterity. This film takes good care of that.

However, it's clear that the BF was played by some real masters. Glanton suddenly had tourist buses going into the Barnes neighborhood all week long in the '90s; he clearly wanted to make the 'hood mad at the traffic and thus give yet more reason for the place to be moved. They sadly played right into his hands; as said, this was a looong plan played out over decades. The gangster money of the Annenberg family has been waiting for 70 years to get revenge on Barnes' superior taste and intelligence, but in the end their transparent greed only confirms his superiority in every way. That they are pilfering Barnes' collection for their foundations, along with the Peeyew Your Money Smells folks and the Scamfasts, all in the name of ""charity"", is too perfect (I'd like to see a  movie about where all their ""charitable"" money goes, speaking of corruption and buying favors; no doubt Ott, Watson, Steele and Glanton have enjoyed many perks from these coffers).

But the greatest irony is that this little work of art, this simple but so well done documentary, is quite likely to be how most of these people are remembered by the world at large as time goes by. And man, do they look sleazy. I had to crack up when they did a slow close-up of that Becky Rimel photo where she looks so hideous, like some sort of ugly sister of Medusa with a flabby neck and no chin and those beady, sneaky little eyes...you can just hear her whining to her friends over chardonnay at the club, ""They used the worst picture they could find!"" One can be sure there was no shortage; you can't scheme on this level without it showing up on your face, no matter how often the plastic surgeons stretch it over your head and down your spine towards the flickering, darting tail of Beelezebub.

But seriously, folks, this film really is well worth watching, not just for the entertainment but for the education of how great crimes are made to happen nowadays. The old saying, behind every great fortune is a great crime, is turned on its ear here, and this great crime has stolen a truly massive great fortune from a few schools, Barnes' and Lincoln, and used it to to enrich their own fortunes yet further. THIS is how the game is played: with a cast of plenty, anyone who wants more money and career being welcome if they can slither on in to the throne room, all the way to Ott, who must have quite a fun time looking himself in the mirror these days. ""No standing""! Hoho! Perfectly good standing is exactly what this film, the case against this crime, and Barnes' will and original intent do have.

Yes, more people can see the paintings now, and that's the sole positive here, but by that logic every person on the globe should have full access to every painting ever painted, for free...and you know that ain't what these folks have in mind. Where's the money in it for them? The real issue is whether we have the right to have our lives' works preserved as we want them when we're gone, and whether our wills and trusts and wishes will be honored...and this film makes it clear that we really don't, and they probably won't. It's sad, as the Barnes is such a truly unique place, one of a kind, and now it'll just be another collection in the monolithic world of modern art. The exact opposite of what Barnes wanted...but what did he know? He only put the collection together and was friends with most of the artists. What rights does he have once he's gone? None, clearly.

And the true sign of crime here---the $100 million secretly tucked into the budget for moving the Barnes collection before it had even gone to court---well, there's no arguing that...especially since Ott was so obviously bought off. Make that man a Senator!

TAOTS clearly shows how the Barnes Foundation was concertedly made to falter by many people over the past few decades, all for personal gain of power and ""prestige"" and money, by a bunch of amazingly phony, soulless people. That they are on display in all their greed for posterity in this film is a work of art in itself, and one can feel the hand of old Barnes reaching out from beyond the grave to make the final point here: you can trust a few people, but sooner or later they die off and sooner than later sleazy, greedy folks will show up and grab all that they can plunder.

It sure is nice to see them get theirs here, though.
Sweet dreams, you weasels. THIS is your place in history.",1281484800,85,7736,4.674504041146216
4129725,5,B003JHXS1E,"Can something be both fantastic and utterly disgusting at the same time? If so, then this movie is it. I knew about this situation somewhat peripherally, but having it all laid out in front of me as it is in this film, just ties all the pieces together to what I think must be the art heist of the century. All you need to do is follow the money in this film to see who the real theives are. By the time it's over it is abundantly clear just what happened to the Barne's Foundation and its fabulous collection. You will be especially appalled by the corporate greed that surrounds the telling of this story and the corporate whore who is at the center of it.

Is it a crime to be eccentric? That is basically what the entire string of thinking that promulgated by the high profile crowd in this film seems to say about Dr. Barnes. And frankly, that's the biggest lie I've ever heard. Does being eccentric invalidate a man's will? It certainly shouldn't, but that is what has been allowed to happen. The people of Philadelphia turned there backs on Dr. Albert Barnes once in his life when they were too small minded to share his forsight, but then when he was gone, they wanted to reap the spoils of his genius.

But at the same time, I think the neighbors of the Barnes Foundation should shoulder a great amount of the blame for what happened here too. Had they kept their big mouths shut in the first place, much of this whole thing could have been avoided. What really cracks me up is that the Barnes Foundation has most likely been there longer than any of its neighbors. They moved there knowing it was there... but alas.

Anyway, watch this film, think about what it says, and be just as enraged as I was by it. It is a travesty of grand proportions.",1280448000,35,1755,4.344512195121951
4129726,5,B003JHXS1E,"I watched this documentary at home one day with nothing else to do. I had gone to the Barnes Foundation and thought the art was beyond believable. This documentary was so unbelievable, the people who stole this art, the politicians who let this happen - what is the story with Philadelphia? Your governor, your mayor let this happen - they were proud that they should steal this art, they think it is for the benefit of the masses.
Why would the will of an individual not be honored by law? Everything Dr. Barnes wanted is now being disregarded. It is a crime, I mean it is really a serious crime concerning billions of dollars of art that is being disregarded. What are your thoughts?",1278028800,53,685,4.532258064516129
4129727,5,B003JHXS1E,"I hate to see how the greed of money and power can cause the creation of something so beautiful and recognized, into something completely ruined. The artwork in this film definitely loses its soul and personality because of ridiculous actions of people who should not have had any involvement with the Barnes Foundation in the first place. Only another reason for me to believe that this world is not morally cultivated at all, especially when it involves a dead man's final wishes. This act from the government and the rich socialites involved in this is basically wishing no for the late Dr. Barnes and his fellow trustees no peace at all. I was hoping to see the ending to be that the collection would come back to its rightful place, but sadly the real world is not we all hope for. It sucked seeing how peoples effort to do the right thing get thrown away. Truly hate the world we live in today.",1507248000,2,900,4.52760736196319

It's reprehensible what the Annenbergs and others did to Barnes.  You'll never see that Annenberg logo on PBS and think the same of it again after viewing this documentary.  It's not surprising that Pennsylvania politicos like Ed Rendell were also dirty dealing in this situation but what is the most despicable is the fact that one man who wanted glory and attention used his position on the Barnes Foundation to, essentially end up dismantling it and the spirit of what Barnes wanted.  It's sad that those we lacked Barnes' work ethic and intelligence, let alone business savvy, were determined to get their hands on his property one way or another.",1502323200,3,812,4.86231884057971

4129737,5,B003JHXS1E,"This is an excellent movie if you're passionate about art and highly skeptical about the art establishment. First of all, everyone who loves great nineteenth century French art should know about the Barnes and the remarkable collection Dr. Barnes amassed when most major art museums -- especially in Philadelphia -- were turning up their nose at the same art. It is easily one of the most valuable collections ever ($25-$50b). It is then especially tragic that Dr. Barnes's intention for his legacy would ultimately be thwarted by those same institutions. The story is told with both drama and clarity, using interviews with especially passionate experts on the collection, feckless comments from the politicians, who still don't believe they did anything wrong and compelling archival film.",1481155200,6,791,5.336

4129743,5,B003JHXS1E,"As an arts manager, I am familiar with the political back-door dealings related to arts and culture, and this is one of the greatest controversies of our time.  What do we do when a billionaire dies, and the greatest collection in the world of post-impressionist and early 20th century art is housed in his mansion, all but inaccessible to the public?  Does the public have a ""right"" to art?  Does anyone have the right to overturn conditions in a person's will?  These questions and more are examined in Art of the Steal, which tells the story of the fabled Barnes collection. When Arthur Barnes died in 1951, he left extensive instructions for his collection which included limited public access to his estate.  After years of negotiation, an independent nonprofit called the Barnes Foundation took over control of the collection and moved it to a new building on Benjamin Franklin Parkway near the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  Art purists argued (and are still arguing) that this was counter to Barnes' wishes, and the collection belonged to Barnes, not the people of Philadelphia.  Those in favor of the move (including such notables as then-Mayor Ed Rendell) championed the tourism benefits of having the collection available to the public, and others argued that the conditions in the mansion were no longer appropriate to house the art.  It's a fascinating tale, told like a mystery thriller.  It was even more fun to watch since I visited the Barnes just two weeks ago.",1466121600,2,1477,4.923387096774194

From an economics standpoint, The Art Of The Steal demonstrates what makes for a genuine cultural treasure.  It goes on to show how vulnerability to plunder positively serves to increase the value of such treasure.  Even though the Barnes collection has since been relocated to Philadelphia, this documentary stands out as one of the most intriguing chapters in art history.  Now matter where the viewers' sentiments may fall, can anybody prove there has been actual loss in value by removing the collection from its original context?

Dr. Albert C. Barnes, sometimes ridiculously slandered as mean spirited, and as having a natural antipathy to mankind, was a medical doctor/researcher who made a fortune near the turn of the 20th century with a breakthrough treatment of STDs.  And he used much of this fortune to purchase Art, eventually coming to be valued at tens of billions of dollars, possibly more.  So then, this film is an examination of the Art and what happened to it: the battle for control of possibly the finest private collection in the world, and for the interpretation of Dr. Barnes' Will....

  Even if you disagree with the conclusions of the film, it is notable in its own right as a study of Dr. Barnes, the man, and as a gentle survey of the art itself.  It is also intriguing as a study of man, the social animal, of the workings of Government, Law and the Courts, and of the various people dedicated to, for one reason or another, Art History.

4129780,4,B003JHXS1E,"This is a passionately made documentary about how the rug was yanked out from under the legitimate trustees of the Barnes Foundation in order to move its priceless art collection to Philadelphia. I was lucky enough to have visited the Barnes when it was still in Merion. Barnes unintentionally created intractable problems for his collection when he put it in a quiet, affluent, suburban neighborhood, while at the same time intending that his collection should be for ordinary people. This has always puzzled me. Originally, he actually hung the paintings in his factory in Philadelphia so the workers could see them. When the power brokers zoomed in on the Barnes, the residents of Merion, on one hand, wanted the collection to stay in the neighborhood but, on the other hand, made it as difficult as possible for visitors to see it by restricting their numbers. Also, there was no way to reach it by public transportation. The septa station is not close by. This stubbornness on the part of the residents was their fatal flaw--and it made the Foundation vulnerable. By the time the town and county were willing to change the zoning, it was too late. The Annenbergs and the Pew foundation are no angels, but if Barnes had originally put his collection in Philadelphia in the first place, in a working-class neighborhood instead of in a wealthy suburb, he could have fulfilled his ideals about making art accessible to everyone, not just the elite. Unfortunately, even in its new location, it's still not easy to get in and see the collection. Visiting it has always been an elitist experience, ironically.",1432944000,,1607,4.911764705882353

To compound the horror of this act, the knowledge that it was tied to a 100-billion-dollar art collection that was amassed by one man - possibly the best collection of art that the world has ever seen - leaves those of us with much smaller means with a view of life that seems futile at best, given the forces of government, big money and power-hungry social mavens which might work against our own small plans.

Barnes will (made in 1922).

While there's no question the tactics used by those in power are sleazy, the film also ignores what I consider a key issue: Is it really such a bad thing that one of the most amazing collections of modern art be much more accessible to the public, even if it violates the will of a man with no heirs who has been dead over 50 years? At what point do old grudges - going both ways - count less than art belonging to the world? I'm not saying there are neat answers to such questions, but the film acts like there's no moral murkiness at all.

Similarly the film uses questionable tactics to argue its case. For example it's constantly stating how those on the 'other side' refuse to be interviewed. Yet, it is clear that the ideology of the film-makers is known to all involved -- the film is financed by one of the leaders of the group fighting against the collections movement, and guards at a gathering of those planning the art move know not to allow in this specific film crew, even mentioning their production company name. If you knew you a film was being made whose basic premise is that you're a swindler a cheat and a thief with no respect for art, would you agree to be interviewed?

Additionally, some of those who seem so calm and well reasoned while being interviewed and arguing the art should be left where it is, seem a little less impressive when you see them outside that same gathering screaming 'philistines!' at those going inside.

None-the less, I still enjoyed the film, and there's no question it does a good job exposing the fact that many of our biggest public trusts and charitable institutions have a lot going on besides 'acting in the public interest', and are willing to play dirty pool to get what they want. I just find it hard to see this as a case of moral outrage to rank with the Iraq war, or starving children, or the U.S. educational crisis. Since it doesn't really explore the deeper issues it touches on -- What is private property?  Who does art belong to?  How long does ownership last?  Is it wrong to show the insides of the pyramids?  Surely THAT can't be what it's constructors intended, so where is the line?)-- it's basically rich people hating on rich people.

Because of the disdain the museums showed Barnes, he bequeathed that his works would never be transported from their home at his estate in Upper Merion, Pennsylvania. After the death of himself and a like minded docent that he trusted, the collection was whittled away from his wishes through a complex maneuvering of carefully stocked boardrooms and self-interested trustees. His works were paraded on display, against his wishes, and ultimately taken away to a museum in Center City Philadelphia thanks to the finagling of the Pew Charitable Trusts, which became a public nonprofit using the collection as bait to gain that status.

4129823,3,B003JHXS1E,"This movie makes a lot of arguments that don't hold up to examination.  There's a populist argument, which is essentially that by placing this priceless collection of art in the suburbs and cutting it off from the public, snooty know-nothing art critics are cut out and the common janitor from New York gets too see it.  That's stupid on its face.  Sealing these masterworks away from the public ensures that practically no one gets to see it.  Another argument is that this is about big business coopting this collection.  Also nonsense, as all of the foundations involved in the move to Philly were non-profits.  These absurd arguments are made using great truth-stretching and conflicting logic, like how in one scene they show that turning it into a conventional museum enraged the wealthy suburban neighbors, then spending the rest of the movie arguing it was financial viable to stay there because, long after the move was announced, Lower Merion floated the idea of a bond to pay for the endowment--and who knows what the chances of success were.

The only argument the movie is left with is a private property argument.  Barnes clearly stipulated in his will and in the foundation's incorporation documents that the paintings not be moved.  His intentions were inarguably being subverted.  Yet the movie, despite its pseudo-populism, *never* stops to ask whether the whims of this decades-dead one-percenter should keep the rest of the world from being given a chance to see great masterworks.  Sorry, but you can't claim the mantle of liberalism while exalting property rights to that extent.  What if some robber baron somehow gained title to, say, Central Park?  Should he then be able to deprive the rest of the city of New York from enjoying it?  No?  What if he's able to gin up some nonsense about how keeping the public out is really his defying the powers that be?

As annoying and flimsy as the film's intellectual arguments are, it's very well-made.  It somehow manages to make the tale of boardroom intrigue at a non-profit trust, and the supposed machinations of city officials, quite fascinating throughout.

4129829,5,B003JHXS1E,"Albert C. Barnes was born in 1872 to working-class parents in Philadelphia. An avid student, he accumulated degrees and became an MD by the early age of 20. He also studied pharmacy and chemistry at the University of Berlin and made important connections with individuals in Germany.

Using his education and those friendships, he collaborated in the development of a compound that quickly made him a millionaire. Being somewhat of a Renaissance man, he studied educational concepts, art, philosophy, and psychology. He began testing his theories on his employees by exposing them to art appreciation discussions and displaying art in the buildings for their benefit. To those ends, he purchased twelve acres outside Philadelphia and established the Barnes Foundation in 1922.

Now that you have that background, you can skim through the first of the DVD and get to the heart of the matter: Barnes had an unerring eye for modern art. He made many, many trips to Europe and his collection grew steadily. He generously offered to loan a few pieces to the Art Museum and was soundly ridiculed for his worthless art.

From then on, his collection was displayed in a specially designed and built facility on Foundation grounds. As modern art became accepted in society, his collection gained stature but he continued his humanitarian acts. He founded (and funded) a school for African-American students, he continued to travel extensively and he collected additional art. His wife Laura established the Arboretum School for the study of horticulture, botany and landscaping.

By the time he died, the Philadelphia Art Museum, demonstrating a complete change of heart, was lusting after his collection, now valued at $25 billion! The terms of his will clearly prohibit any of his art ever to leave Foundation property and most particularly to be loaned to the Philadelphia Art Museum.

Herein lies the tale... Remember the title of this film! This story is interesting, funny, sad, infuriating, and frustrating. There are excellent interviews sprinkled around in this documentary, along with newspaper headlines, numerous photographs and commentaries, insight into a long-standing grudge match and the ineptitude of well-meaning people. Of course, the City of Philadelphia has its own view of the matter....

Worse, his enemies who confronted him while Barns alive, ended up controlling the art.

Evidently Dr. Barnes acquired a collection of masterpieces over decades that today is worth billions of dollars.

The filmmakers certainly take the side of the man's intent and it's hard not to sympathize.  At the same time the opposite viewpoint (the trust was broke) is not strongly presented.  That does not appear to be the fault of the filmmakers however as efforts were made but the power brokers involved refused to be interviewed.  This isn't ""gotcha"" journalism at all and the viewpoint would have added some balance.  As it is, it appears that the filmmaker's case holds strong elements of truth.

Power and money were the driving motivation in grabbing this collection.  Certainly, the ability for more people to see it in a larger facility has its merits.

4129833,1,B003JHXS1E,"""In truth, art belongs to no one. Some of us are simply its temporary, fortunate custodians.""  - Sir Richard Attenborough

This is a one-sided opinion piece about a dubious effort to keep great art locked away in a private collection of a dead man where few people could see it.  Somehow the filmmakers are trying to sell us on the notion that efforts to make the art available to the public at a public museum is a great travesty.  The makers of the film made it clear they opposed making the art accessible to the public (as demonstrated by the numerous interviews with angry neighbors and snarky comments about art lovers who came to view it), they but they also oppose the idea of moving it anywhere else or even allowing it to be loaned to museums for the public to see it.

Their argument hinges on the notion that Barnes' wishes as outlined in his will should give him the right to forever keep the art locked away in his private collection so that the public at large wouldn't be allowed to view the art in a public museum (mainly because he had a personal vendetta against the city's art community as it existed during his time).  But in reality Barnes was nothing more than a rich individual who was just the most recent in a line of many temporary custodians of this great art.  His will shouldn't give him the right to also keep it to himself for all of eternity after his death.  Now for the first time the art belongs to not a single wealthy individual, but to everyone, at a public museum where it can be freely appreciated and enjoyed by all of us.

The film does make the point that many power moves were needed to relocate the collection.  Most of all, Lincoln University probably lost out more than anyone since they should have been able to benefit more significantly from the art that was endowed to them.  But the film even manages to vilify the University as well.

4129836,3,B003JHXS1E,"The documentary itself is endlessly fascinating and entertaining. The problem is this is a DVD and it contains zero extras. When you consider it's about one of the greatest art collections in the world, why not a walk-through each of the rooms of the Barnes? Why not have a sit-down with former students and a discussion on what the Barnes has meant to them inside and outside the world of art?

The documentary also has plenty of flaws. The makers were unable to get interviews with many of the people who are behind the organized hijacking of the Barnes collection from a suburb of Philadelphia to the city proper. In many ways, being more a casual lover of art vs. one with a passionate knowledge, I could not get why there could not be a compromise to keep the Barnes as a teaching institute in its same location yet at the same time open it up even a smidge to the general public maybe along the lines of the Getty in suburban LA (numbers are somewhat limited per day and it's also located away from a residential area).

Also, not enough is made of why Barnes lifetime fight with the denizens of Philly's elite really helped fuel their fire to steal the collection. If you believe in any version of hell, you know the entire Philly elite are headed there for this egregious theft (and it is a theft albeit one done using political and legal loopholes).

Lastly, what really threw me for a loop was Civil Rights veteran Julian Bond showing up in the film (he has a connection to Barnes you'll discover) as a definitive voice of reason who pulls no punches at all.

4129854,3,B003JHXS1E,"I wanted to accept the argument made in this film that it would be a very bad thing for Dr. Barnes' invaluable art collection to be removed from private custodianship and put instead on public display. But as this documentary progressed, I became less and less sure that I could in fact be on the side of the producers of this exposition.

""The Art of the Steal"" tracks the fate of the large collection of post-impressionistic paintings that Dr. Albert Barnes amassed. His intention was that the collection should remain available for viewing only to serious art students in his gladed suburban setting. When conservators had briefly acceded to pressure to democratize access to the collection, they'd been appalled to hear one visitor to the private gallery-mansion summarize his experience as a view of ""a lot of fat ladies.""

Dr. Barnes had taken pains to keep the collection in the private hands of trained art teachers after his death. Circumstances started to carry the collection along a more circuitous route though, and fifty years after Dr. Barnes death, the collection was in jeopardy of being a general tourist attraction in downtown Philadelphia.

The point of this film is to expose and deplore this development. They argue that putting the collection on display in a central museum would be tantamount to ""McDonaldizing"" the collection. Well, I'm not sure that that follows, or if it does follow that it really matters. Why should one group's reduction of the experience to a bunch of easily accessible ""fat ladies""  affect other peoples' proper appreciation of the art?

However, both sides of this ongoing struggle for control of the collection make some valid points. Whether or not you agree with the protestors who, over the years, have fought against removal of the collection to a more accessible venue - you will probably find yourself being challenged to think about some of the larger issues raised by this struggle. How much should anyone's Last Will & Testament continue to be honored as the decades pass? How much should individuals expect to dictate about the disposition of property after their deaths? This in turns leads to even larger philosophical questions. To what extent should authorities be ""strict constructionists"" when it comes to interpreting and enforcing legal documents; and to what extent should the authorities be flexible in their enforcements as the general tenor of the times change?

So although this specific cause aimed at preserving Dr. Barnes' collection inviolate in its original setting might seem a bit precious and elitist to many viewers, you'll probably have to agree that the controversy as presented here has some far-reaching and interesting implications.",1297123200,6,2720,5.128668171557562

4129856,4,B003JHXS1E,"Today, I am an art historian who became one, in large part, because of the magnificent collection at the Barnes Foundation.  I grew up a mile from the Barnes and went regularly with my family, paying only $1 or $2 per visit.  We were by no means wealthy-- I lived on the ""other side of the tracks""--truly West Philadelphia born and raised.  I volunteered at the Barnes, briefly, in the early 1990s while in college, shortly after Mr. Glanton had begun to undo the intentions of Dr. Barnes. At the time, I sympathized with the impulse to make this amazing collection available to more people, but I was too young to understand the cost.  Last week, I visited the Barnes for a nostalgic last look at the paintings that had become childhood friends.  Now a college professor, I brought a large group of my financially-struggling students who each paid an admission price of $17 (The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in NY, which never had a mission to bring art to the poor, working classes as Barnes did, charges $20), plus $15/vehicle for parking. Upon entry, we encountered the store (a Glanton feature never countenanced by Barnes), in which is sold prints of various paintings from the collection (that were never, according to Barnes, supposed to be reproduced), which had traveled across the world for a tour at major museums in Paris, Tokyo, etc. under Glanton's supervision (a direct violation of Dr. Barnes' will). Members of my family snidely comment whenever we see this store, ""Barnes is surely rolling over in his grave.""  As a Philadelphia native, I am thrilled to see the city's tourism market thrive. As an art historian, I am delighted to share this unparalleled collection with more people...  But as a staunch believer in equality and fairness, I find the permanent relocation of the entire collection against the expressed (and legally binding) wishes of the founder troubling.  If we are a society of laws, to whom and when do they apply?  Those in favor of the move laud the purported outcome that the work will be more accessible. But at $17 per person, to whom does access apply?",1290124800,16,2096,4.767955801104972
4129857,5,B003JHXS1E,"The Art of the Steal is a riveting documentary that tells two sides of a tale: One is of The Barnes Foundation, an amazing school for artists (that also contained one of the most prized collections of art ever assembled) created by the quirky yet brilliant Albert C. Barnes. Side Two is of a group of politicians and power-mongers who saw the multi-billion dollar art collection as a prize to be garnered for the city of Philadelphia that could potentially reap a windfall of tourism if moved from its suburban home into the heart of the city itself, only a few miles away. As they say: location, location, location.

Barnes was snubbed in the early 20th Century by local Philadelphia art critics and society for having a collection of art that deemed primitive and unworthy. As a snub to them, he put together a trust that would guarantee (or so he thought) that his collection could never be owned, moved, or sold by these same so-called art experts who only used art as a means to gain entrance into rich parlour society.

Flash forward to the 1990's: Barnes is long dead, the collection is now estimated at being worth 2-3 billion (some claim even more than 30 billion), and has become a sought after prize by the same type of people who denounced it 70 years beforehand.

This very well-done documentary explains the process undergone to break the Barnes Trust so that this group of politicians could move the collection into a brand new building and be curated in a way that they sought fit.

Are these people evil? Well, at first glance, yes. Barnes never wanted to create an experience for the masses; he built an art school that used his paintings (Cezannes, Van Goghs, Matisses, Renoirs, etc.) as a teaching tool. They were hung in an intimate setting that enhanced them in a way that most museums could not recreate. Most museums are designed to get 'em in and get 'em out, reaping as much money as possible. To hear the politicians brag about being able to show off this collection to the masses makes the stomach churn.

View this film for yourself; the soundtrack heightens the dramatic tension. The camera angles and editing make it much more than just a dry documentary. The passions of those interviewed (and those who chose not to be interviewed) are palpable. Other than a trailer and a few promos, there are no extras, but this is the type of film that needs no extras.

For those wanting to experience The Barnes collection as it was meant to be experienced, time is running out. As of January 2011, his original building and collection will be closed so that the paintings can be moved to their new ""McMuseum"" near the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

4129858,5,B003JHXS1E,"After watching all 101 minutes of The Art of the Steal, I have great admiration for the cool and calculating way it draws you helplessly into the horrifying story, little by little, scene after scene - even the corny typewriter keys and silent movie cards with chapter titles - until you end up livid with rage against Philadelphia's Philistine elite violating a good man's magnificent life's work without the least respect for his wishes for its preservation.
After calming down for a few hours, I began to ask myself, What Would Barnes Do?
Well, what WOULD he do?
If he saw the present situation, with money, power lust, politics and raw greed consuming all he ever loved about his astounding collection and his miraculous school, would he fight it in court - knowing that he would lose to lawyers so crass they'd negotiate with Pontius Pilate to move the crucifixion of Christ from Jerusalem to Philadelphia on Benjamin Franklin Parkway so everybody can see - for a nominal fee, of course?
Would he lead a campaign against the powerful who can make their ghastly actions sound like they're doing just exactly what Mr. Barnes wanted?
Then I had a flashback to the climactic scene at the end of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. I'd left her politics behind such a long time ago, it took me a minute to realize that my flashback had comee from her book.
As she wrote it, Howard Roark, her architect-protagonist, after lifelong struggle to preserve the integrity of his work, sees his magnificent, career-crowning plans for a beautiful, well-thought-out, innovative residential community stolen by second-raters, redesigned by committee into a nice, easy-going ugly sanitary slum - and construction almost complete! So he does the only thing left to him to preserve his original: he dynamites the entire multi-million-dollar development into atoms - not a shred left. Gone forever. The thieves deprived of their prize.
Would Barnes do that? With a few tons of dynamite, take his entire life's work with him into that undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns?
Yes, you CAN take it with you. All $30 billion worth.
But would Barnes?
Would he?
I couldn't.

said the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns.

Much the same language could be used to describe the sad story of the Barnes Foundation.  This documentary film chronologies the history of ""The Barns"" (which was founded by the eccentric multi-millionaire pharmaceutical manufacture Dr. Albert C. Barnes) and its serendipitous ownership of over $35 Billion (WOW!) dollars of post-impressionist art - by some measurement more than exists within the City of Paris.

The film seeks to portray all of the dark forces of ""the establishment"", who appeared to have engaged in a coordinated and self-serving attack to divert the Foundation from its stated purposes and into a more ""conventional art experience"" - culminating in the relocation of the collection into the art district of the City of Philadelphia.  The film frequently states that Dr, Barnes consulting with ""... the best attorneys to draw up his will ..."" (as well as deed of trust for his art foundation).  The film explains in great detail how this governing trust instrument was systemically circumvented, ignored, overridden, watered down and vacated to the point of irrelevancy.

However, after view the DVD several times, I began to feel that this treasure trove of art was essentially doomed from its inception (in my option); given my understanding of tax, and not-for-profit organizational operations.  There is an old proverb that states, ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"".  Dr Barnes' attempt to ""spite"" the conventional world of art and culture, which had previously belittled him (personally) and his art collection; simply set in motion powerful forces that, over time, allied against the foundation and ultimately undermined its functionality.

Midway through the film, one of the interviewees makes a comments (to the effect) ""about what might have been""; if the Foundation had included proper oversight and foresight.  In my view this statement summarizes the essence and the great sadness of this documentary film: THE ART OF THE STEAL.  While this magnificent collection will now be seen and appreciated by a greater potion of the general public; the uniqueness of the Barnes Collection has been lost forever.",1283817600,6,2243,5.237430167597766

Those same people start complaining again that now the Barnes is failing. Moving the collection to the Ben Franklin Parkway, among the Rodin Museum, the PMA and several Calder mobiles IS THE GREATEST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE AMERICAN ART SPECTRUM.

4129865,3,B003JHXS1E,"After watching this very well produced two hour film about the moving of a private collection of art worth billions I was struck at just how one sided an arguement was presented.  Boiled down the film maker takes the stance that 'the public doesn't know or care about art' which is why this vast collection should have remained in a small museum that doesn't allow more than a few hundred people in.  The reaction by the fims 'art snobs' when the museum is open to the public is one of open mouth shock, as if vandals were being allowed to deface the paintings.  I would compare it to a small coffee shop that you enjoy going to, if word gets out that they serve good coffee and more people want to frequent this establishment there is that resentment because 'I was here first'.  Unfortunately outside of the artist community people do enjoy and should have the opportunity to view any and all art.  It is this arguement that the film completely overlooks.

Though how the arts movement to a much larger and more public venue is by no means ethical.  Politicians and some very wealthy individuals wanted to make the move happen for their own private benefits.  They do not come out looking very well either at the films conclusion.  Just how the moves took place is open to some speculation but the facts, filings and budgets do make it pretty clear some people wanted this moved and would do anything to get it moved.

4129867,5,B003JHXS1E,"A moving story of the greatest theft of private property by the state and its powerful allies in the civic and charitable community.

It is my dream to create an art which is filled with balance, purity and calmness, freed from a subject matter that is disconcerting or too attention-seeking. In my paintings, I wish to create a spiritual remedy, similar to a comfortable armchair which provides rest from physical expectation for the spiritually working, the businessman as well as the artist. ~ Henri Matisse

The dream of the artist Henri Matisse was embodied in the art collection of Dr. Albert C. Barnes and the Barnes Foundation. The Barnes Foundation (founded in 1922) located in Merion Pennsylvania about 5 miles outside Philadelphia is home (and I literally mean home) to some of the greatest art treasures in the modern world, Matisse, Renoir, Czzane, Picaso, van Gogh, Monet to name just a few. It is estimated to be worth $25-$35 billion and considered the world's greatest collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Early Modern art. The collection includes such great works as The Portrait of the Postman Joseph Roulin (van Gogh), The Card Players (Czanne) and The Joy of Life (Matisse). Dr. Barnes was one of the few collectors that viewed African Art not as primitive cultural artifacts but as works of art equal to the great works of Europe.

To think of Dr. Barnes as simply an art lover or collector does not do him justice. Dr. Barnes understood what Matisse was searching for in his dreams - balance, purity, calmness, a spiritual remedy for businessman as well as the artist. Dr. Barnes built his Foundation and displayed his art (and it was his art) in his house organized not by artist or subject but by the aesthetic and spiritual connection between the pieces. A van Gogh is hung next to a door lock, a piece of furniture or an African sculpture. The rooms are comfortable so one can pause for any length and contemplate the great works. The site is adorned with beautiful gardens and located in a serene neighborhood in Lower Merion, PA. Unfortunately, in 2012 it will all be gone. The Art Of The Steal is a riveting movie that shows how the state and its powerful allies in the art and charitable establishment trample the private property rights of the individual who in the words of the great artist Matisse created ""the only sane place to see art in America.""

Dr. Barnes himself is a classic example of the power of free markets. He was born into poverty and grew up in the low income neighborhoods around Philadelphia. He financed his college education by boxing professionally. He became a chemist and physician, invented and patented Argyrol, a substitute for Silver Nitrate, which, at the time was put in the eyes of every baby born in the USA to prevent venereal disease (an unintended consequence of war). He made his fortune in pharmaceuticals and used his fortune to gather the world's greatest collection of early and post-modern art. In 1923 he displayed seventy-five paintings including works of Soutine, Picasso, Chirico, and Matisse at the Philadelphia Academy of the Fine Arts.

The art and Dr. Barnes were excoriated by the Philadelphia art establishment, mainly the powerful Philadelphia Inquirer owned by Moses Annenberg (the father of Walter Annenberg who later in life established the ""The Annenberg Foundation"" one of the key players in the state confiscation of Dr. Barnes private property). His experience left him bitter and hostile towards the Philadelphia art establishment and the Philadelphia Inquirer. Another event had a great influence on Dr. Barnes decision to move the art out of Philadelphia. John G Johnson, an attorney to some of the most powerful men in the world including J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie was the owner of a substantial art collection himself. He died on April 14, 1917 and donated his collection to the citizens of Philadelphia but directed that the art be preserved in his home on S. Broadstreet in Philadelphia. A few years later The Philadelphia Museum of Art opened a new neo-classical wing and needed art to fill it. By 1933 the museum came up with an ""extraordinary reason"" to move the collection. In 1921 the city of Philadelphia convinced the Orphan's Court (with the full backing of the Philadelphia Inquirer) that the paintings were threatened because Johnson's home was not fireproof. The home was condemned and the art moved to the museum under the stipulation the museum honor the remaining provisions of the will to keep the collection together (in 1989 the museum convinced the court to allow them to break up the collection for a ""more unified presentation""). Barnes witnessed this in 1933 and vowed they (the Philadelphia art establishment, socialites and politicians of Philadelphia) would never get a hold of his collection - unfortunately Dr. Barnes underestimated the power of the state.

Dr. Barnes was killed in 1951 in a car crash (was it an accident?). This left the Barnes Foundation in the hands of Violette de Mazia who was Director of Education. During her life the Barnes Foundation stayed true to Dr. Barnes's Will and Testament, it stayed in Merion and was used primarily to educate. The public could view the collection but only during limited hours. Unfortunately, Barnes had no children so when Mrs. de Mazia died the Barnes Trust was put in the hands of Lincoln University a small, private all black college located in Pennsylvania and placed under the control of a 5-member board (as per Dr. Barnes will). Later Lincoln University became a state school that was chronically under funded. Yet, under the direction of Franklin Williams (the Lincoln Trustee), and an outside advisory board of art experts, the conditions of the Barnes Trust were honored. Around 1990 Williams died of cancer. Now the question becomes who appoints board members (or as Lenin put it ""who whom""). This is when the wheels were set in motion by powerful forces in Philadelphia, the art establishment and the state of Pennsylvania to steal the collection from the Barnes Foundation ""for the public good"" and move it out of Merion to Philadelphia. At this point the movie plays out like a great Hollywood crime mystery with state institutions and individual politicians playing the villains. The movie chronicles in great detail the chain of events that led to a complete and utter disregard for private property rights. I am no Constitutional lawyer, but this may be the most extreme and egregious case in American history of state violation of private property rights.

The movie was directed and produced by Don Argott and Sheena Joyce. It was funded by Lenny Feinberg (a student of The Barnes Foundation and wealthy real estate investor). Mr Feinberg said he ""stewed"" when he heard the foundation's collection was being moved to Philadelphia which explicitly goes against Dr. Barnes 1951 will, which stated that ""the foundation shall always be an educational institute, and the paintings shall never be removed, sold or loaned."" Supporters formed ""The Friends of the Barnes Foundation"" in late 2004 after the ruling of the Montgomery County Orphan's Court granting permission for - but not mandating - the Board of Trustees of the Barnes Foundation to move the institution's art collection to the city of Philadelphia. One of the supporters, Nick Tinari (A Barnes attorney) is interviewed between shouts of ""Philistines"" and ""have fun now - wait until it's your will"" at people attending a museum event celebrating the move of the Barnes collection to Philadelphia. My only criticism of the movie is that it does not verbally make a stronger use of the constitutional argument for private property rights and often comes off as critical of capitalism when it shouldn't. After all, it was capitalism that provided the wealth Dr. Barnes used to purchase these great art pieces. But, this is a minor criticism. The story itself is a powerful reminder of the corruption of the state. From the abuse of civil rights laws (the powerful interests sued the neighbors of the Barnes Foundation using the Federal Ku Klux Klan Act), the unholy alliance between the state and powerful ""public charitable"" trusts headed by the Pew Foundation, power seeking individuals and corrupt politicians (including the ""dishonorable"" Governor Edward G. Rendell who does his pathetic best to defend the state). This is a story that every freedom loving Libertarian needs to know. There are so many lessons to be learned from this event that a short review simply cannot do justice to it. The movie is well done and the story is riveting. I can think of no better vehicle for teaching why the framers of the Constitution were so adamant that a free and just society respects private property rights and coercive tyrants don't. The dream of Matisse was realized in the art collected by a private individual and destroyed by the nightmare of state abuse.",1282694400,8,8934,4.979906229068988

8398166,4,B003JHXS1E,"The film is primarily about the execution of the will of Barnes. He tried after being spurned by the ""intellectuals of Philidelphia"" who didn't appreciate post-modernist paintings of the great masters. He then retarded all opportunities for the public at large to view these masterpieces except for a select few and students, despite the obvious contributions to mankind these paintings and artifacts had to the world, The film chronicles the forces who didn't necessarily appreciate the artistic value, but the income potential. It tries to convey the conflict between art lovers and pseudo-charitable organizational profit and power seekers. The location of the artwork, being in an upper-class neighborhood with marginal vehicular access opportunities did not lend itself to a compromise. The issue as I understand it is mainly how these priceless artifacts were to be displayed, having been, in modern times, valued at 25-30 Billion dollars. It leaves one wondering why just moving the entire building to the public space on Ben Franklin Boulevard wouldn't have been the obvious solution. That way the art could have been displayed as intended satisfying the terms of the will in principle.",1520899200,2,1194,5.3563829787234045
