3140602,5,B00157OICS,"My wife and I love old westerns. This collection of six of Jimmy Stewart's westerns that we watched recently ranges from 1939 to 1966. It is packed with enjoyment, laughter and action. It can rival some of the finest westerns from other big Hollywood stars of the time. We recommend this box collection to anyone who appreciates good old fashion entertainment.",1230336000,2,360,4.918032786885246
3140603,4,B00157OICS,This is a nobrainer really. You get six films that range from good to classic status from one of Hollywood's most respected and versatile actors for around $20. Also you have three of the five films he made with Anthony Mann as director. There's nothing new as far as bonus features as the titles have been repackaged from previous single editions but for me it was worthwhile to sell the two titles I already owned to have all these fine films in one package.,1228521600,21,460,4.488095238095238
3140604,5,B00157OICS,The full-length interview with James Stewart provided as a commentary on Winchester 73 is worth the price.  Buy it when you can get it for the low price. Each film is in it's own plastic case - a thin one - with all 6 in a box for easy storage.,1213920000,30,244,3.88
3140605,5,B00157OICS,"Seems like everyone is putting out western collections this year, and Universal is no exception. The westerns included in this set are:

Destry Rides Again (1939) - NO EXTRAS
Winchester '73 (1950) - features Interview with James Stewart that is actually a commentary that runs throughout the film.
Bend Of The River (1952) - NO EXTRAS
The Far Country (1955) - NO EXTRAS
Night Passage (1957) - NO EXTRAS
The Rare Breed (1966) - NO EXTRAS

They are all already on DVD. The press release says that Universal will  repackage the same content with the exception of The Far Country. Its original aspect ration is 1.85:1, but its May 2003 DVD release was in the full screen format. However, the specs for this set show The Far Country as being released in 1.85:1.

Here you get to see James Stewart evolve as a western star. In ""Destry Rides Again"" he plays the same old likable character we have seen throughout the 30's. It was too bad it was made in the golden year of 1939, or else the film would probably be better known. ""Winchester 73"" sees the beginning of Stewart's teaming with Anthony Mann. Together they made what can almost be described as film noir westerns. Here Stewart plays a much darker and more complex character than you are probably accustomed to seeing in westerns of this era. The trend continues in ""Bend of the River"" and ""The Far Country"".

""Night Passage"" was supposed to be another Mann/Stewart western, but the two had such a falling out during filming that another director took over and the two didn't work together again. For whatever reason, this film isn't quite as good as the others in this set, but it is still worthwhile. Finally there is ""The Rare Breed"". Stewart's later comedy/western combinations didn't work as well as his earlier more complex efforts in my opinion, but star power makes this one hold up, with Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith also featured. Plus there are some interesting plot twists involving Stewart's character.

I won't take off points for it, but this set has two drawbacks. First, the only film with any extras is ""Winchester '73"" with Stewart's great commentary. Second, all of these films have been released as singles before. This punishes diehard Stewart fans who bought these films when they were first available less economically. Universal has also been releasing a series of ""Universal Cinema Classics"" including some really great comedies (Midnight/The Major and the Minor/Easy Living). This makes me wonder if I should just wait and see if those films come out in an economical collection later on too.",1204848000,59,2572,4.834090909090909

3140690,5,B00157OICS,"If you are a fan of Jimmy Stewart - and who isn't? - then this collection is terrific!  It has almost all of his westerns wrapped up in a wonderful group.  I particularly like The Rare Breed; where he is more like a Will Penny, than a Rambo.  Winchester '73 is a nice bit of history - for anyone who follows the rifles that helped tame our West.  Destry is more kid-friendly, but still good; especially if you long for Stewart's ""aw shucks"" attitude.

The Far Country and Bend of the River are two similar films that show just a good actor going along for the ride.  Night Passage, however, shows more depth to Stewart; as well as Audie Murphy.  Murphy is the best in this one.  Maybe Jimmy should NOT sing - the accordion was bad enough!",1266278400,3,738,4.297101449275362
3140691,5,B00157OICS,"When we think of Jimmy Stewart, most of us probably think either of his comedies (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harvey/dp/B0000549B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harvey</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Can-t-Take-It-with-You-Remastered/dp/B001GLX6TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Can't Take It with You (Remastered)</a>) or his Westerns, particularly the ones he made with director Anthony Mann.  This slipcased collection supplies your DVD library, at one blow, with half a dozen of his best examples of the latter genre, including his first ever (1939's ""Destry Rides Again,"" made when he was 31), and going on to one of his last (""The Rare Breed,"" 1966).

In ""Destry,"" he plays Tom Destry, Jr., whose father ""cleaned up Tombstone"" and was shot in the back in the process; badly burned by this experience, Tom has sworn off guns, and when his father's old deputy Wash Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) sends for him to help tame Bottleneck, he tries at first to do the job without violence.  Here we see Stewart's famous ""aw-shucks"" demeanor in what may be its first incarnation.  With the help of Wash and a comic Russian character misnamed Callahan (Mischa Auer), he does better than he has a right to expect, but soon learns that when you're dealing with unscrupulous people like saloonowner Kent (Brian Donleavy), it doesn't pay to play nice.

Next comes ""Winchester '73"" (1950), a Mann opus and perhaps Stewart's defining Western.  Here he plays Lin McAdam, a Texan trying to track down the brother (Stephen McNally) who went bad and murdered their father.  His search brings him to Dodge City one Fourth of July, where he signs up for a holiday marksmanship contest with a gorgeous Winchester ""One of 1000"" rifle as the prize.  He wins, too, but his brother steals the rifle and flees, and the rest of the film follows the weapon in its subsequent wanderings and Lin in his continued quest until both come together once again.

In ""Bend of the River"" (1952), another Mann film based upon a novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-of-the-Snake/dp/B000JWBBI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend of the Snake</a>&nbsp;by Bill Gulick, his character is Glyn McLyntock, a former Border Raider in 1850's Kansas who has signed on as a guide for a party of Oregon-bound pioneers in an effort to leave that life behind.  After saving Emerson Cole (Douglas Kennedy) from a lynching party and discovering that he too used to ride the Border, he gets his party safe to the valley they're bound for, but the discovery of gold in the neighborhood imperils the delivery of the supplies and cattle for which they've already paid.  It's up to Glyn to get the goods out of the clutches of avaricious merchants, elude miners hungry for them, and cope with a conspiracy by his drivers and the injury of his friend, pioneer leader Jeremy Baile (Jay C. Flippen).

""The Far Country"" (1954), also directed by Mann, finds him playing Jeff Webster, a cold, mercenary cattleman who drives a herd to Skagway, Alaska, during the Yukon gold rush and is swindled out of it by Skagway's crooked sheriff Gannon (John McIntire).  Stealing the beef back, he gets over the border into Canada and makes it to Dawson, but his troubles have just begun as he copes with two women (saloonowner Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the tomboyish French-Canadian Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet), the insistence of his partner Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) that he isn't really as tough as he makes out, and eventually the pursuit of Gannon.

In ""Night Passage"" (1957), directed by James Nielsen from a novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Passage/dp/0380702959/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Passage</a>&nbsp;by Norman A. Fox, he's Grant McLaine, a former railroad troubleshooter who was fired in disgrace after helping a young train robber known as the Utica Kid (Audie Murphy) to escape.  Back in Colorado after two years as a drifting accordion player, he agrees to magnate Ben Kimball's (Flippen) plea that he carry a payroll on his person to end-of-track in hopes that Whitey Harbin (Dan Duryea) and his gang, who are prone to holding up the pay trains, won't search him.  This is perhaps my favorite of the set, notable for gorgeous location scenery, lots of humor, and a long list of wonderful characters, with Duryea at his psychotic best.

The last entry is ""The Rare Breed,"" directed by Western stalwart Andrew V. McLaglen.  Here Stewart plays aging cowhand Sam ""Bulldog"" Burnett, who reluctantly agrees to help English widow Martha Price (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Hillary (Juliet Mills) deliver their polled Hereford bull, Vindicator, to the Texas rancher whose partner has purchased it for him.  At first Sam thinks a ""muley"" bull is a freak, but the Prices' passion for improving the breed ""lights a fire in him"" that ""goes deep,"" and when Alexander Bowen (Brian Keith), a redheaded Scots frontiersman with a burr as thick as a pea soup and a head harder than an anvil, expresses the idea that Vindicator can't possibly survive the Texas climate, Burnett makes him a bet that will change both their lives.  This one also has a generous measure of humor and several great small parts by Western legends such as Ben Johnson, Jack Elam, and Harry Carey, Jr.

If you like Stewart's Westerns and don't have these six films on DVD, this set is the easiest and probably cheapest way to acquire them.  All are thoroughly enjoyable and showcase his full range as an actor.  Stewart fans, and Western fans, shouldn't miss them.",1263427200,16,5689,5.374578177727784

3140703,4,B00157OICS,"I've always been a huge fan of westerns in general, especially those of either James Stewart and/or John Wayne. For the most part, if you were looking for a western that coupled a decent story with both humor and action you went with the Duke. But if you were looking for a grittier, tougher style of western, at least during the 1950's, only James Stewart would do. Of the six films included here, four were released during the 1950's. Only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destry-Rides-Again/dp/B00008CMRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destry Rides Again</a>&nbsp;(1939) &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rare-Breed/dp/B00008CMT1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rare Breed</a>&nbsp;(1966) do not fall within that decade.

What makes this a good collection is that there is no dead weight when it comes to the titles. Each film is a Stewart classic, unlike some of the John Wayne collections out there that included many of his earlier ""B"" movies. Other titles included in this set are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Far-Country/dp/B00008CMSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Far Country</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winchester-73/dp/B00005JLV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winchester '73</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-Of-The-River/dp/B00008CMRL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend Of The River</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Passage/dp/B00008CMT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Passage</a>.

What disappointed me a bit, and the reason I rated the set at 4 starts instead of 5, was that three of the films (Destry, Bend in the River, and especially Winchester 73) are full frame 1.33:1 format. The other three are widescreen formats. I sure would have preferred all six in a widescreen but twas not to be.

3375099,5,B00157OICS,"My wife and I love old westerns. This collection of six of Jimmy Stewart's westerns that we watched recently ranges from 1939 to 1966. It is packed with enjoyment, laughter and action. It can rival some of the finest westerns from other big Hollywood stars of the time. We recommend this box collection to anyone who appreciates good old fashion entertainment.",1230336000,2,360,4.918032786885246
3375100,4,B00157OICS,This is a nobrainer really. You get six films that range from good to classic status from one of Hollywood's most respected and versatile actors for around $20. Also you have three of the five films he made with Anthony Mann as director. There's nothing new as far as bonus features as the titles have been repackaged from previous single editions but for me it was worthwhile to sell the two titles I already owned to have all these fine films in one package.,1228521600,21,460,4.488095238095238
3375101,5,B00157OICS,The full-length interview with James Stewart provided as a commentary on Winchester 73 is worth the price.  Buy it when you can get it for the low price. Each film is in it's own plastic case - a thin one - with all 6 in a box for easy storage.,1213920000,30,244,3.88
3375102,5,B00157OICS,"Seems like everyone is putting out western collections this year, and Universal is no exception. The westerns included in this set are:

Destry Rides Again (1939) - NO EXTRAS
Winchester '73 (1950) - features Interview with James Stewart that is actually a commentary that runs throughout the film.
Bend Of The River (1952) - NO EXTRAS
The Far Country (1955) - NO EXTRAS
Night Passage (1957) - NO EXTRAS
The Rare Breed (1966) - NO EXTRAS

They are all already on DVD. The press release says that Universal will  repackage the same content with the exception of The Far Country. Its original aspect ration is 1.85:1, but its May 2003 DVD release was in the full screen format. However, the specs for this set show The Far Country as being released in 1.85:1.

Here you get to see James Stewart evolve as a western star. In ""Destry Rides Again"" he plays the same old likable character we have seen throughout the 30's. It was too bad it was made in the golden year of 1939, or else the film would probably be better known. ""Winchester 73"" sees the beginning of Stewart's teaming with Anthony Mann. Together they made what can almost be described as film noir westerns. Here Stewart plays a much darker and more complex character than you are probably accustomed to seeing in westerns of this era. The trend continues in ""Bend of the River"" and ""The Far Country"".

""Night Passage"" was supposed to be another Mann/Stewart western, but the two had such a falling out during filming that another director took over and the two didn't work together again. For whatever reason, this film isn't quite as good as the others in this set, but it is still worthwhile. Finally there is ""The Rare Breed"". Stewart's later comedy/western combinations didn't work as well as his earlier more complex efforts in my opinion, but star power makes this one hold up, with Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith also featured. Plus there are some interesting plot twists involving Stewart's character.

I won't take off points for it, but this set has two drawbacks. First, the only film with any extras is ""Winchester '73"" with Stewart's great commentary. Second, all of these films have been released as singles before. This punishes diehard Stewart fans who bought these films when they were first available less economically. Universal has also been releasing a series of ""Universal Cinema Classics"" including some really great comedies (Midnight/The Major and the Minor/Easy Living). This makes me wonder if I should just wait and see if those films come out in an economical collection later on too.",1204848000,59,2572,4.834090909090909

3375187,5,B00157OICS,"If you are a fan of Jimmy Stewart - and who isn't? - then this collection is terrific!  It has almost all of his westerns wrapped up in a wonderful group.  I particularly like The Rare Breed; where he is more like a Will Penny, than a Rambo.  Winchester '73 is a nice bit of history - for anyone who follows the rifles that helped tame our West.  Destry is more kid-friendly, but still good; especially if you long for Stewart's ""aw shucks"" attitude.

The Far Country and Bend of the River are two similar films that show just a good actor going along for the ride.  Night Passage, however, shows more depth to Stewart; as well as Audie Murphy.  Murphy is the best in this one.  Maybe Jimmy should NOT sing - the accordion was bad enough!",1266278400,3,738,4.297101449275362
3375188,5,B00157OICS,"When we think of Jimmy Stewart, most of us probably think either of his comedies (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harvey/dp/B0000549B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harvey</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Can-t-Take-It-with-You-Remastered/dp/B001GLX6TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Can't Take It with You (Remastered)</a>) or his Westerns, particularly the ones he made with director Anthony Mann.  This slipcased collection supplies your DVD library, at one blow, with half a dozen of his best examples of the latter genre, including his first ever (1939's ""Destry Rides Again,"" made when he was 31), and going on to one of his last (""The Rare Breed,"" 1966).

In ""Destry,"" he plays Tom Destry, Jr., whose father ""cleaned up Tombstone"" and was shot in the back in the process; badly burned by this experience, Tom has sworn off guns, and when his father's old deputy Wash Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) sends for him to help tame Bottleneck, he tries at first to do the job without violence.  Here we see Stewart's famous ""aw-shucks"" demeanor in what may be its first incarnation.  With the help of Wash and a comic Russian character misnamed Callahan (Mischa Auer), he does better than he has a right to expect, but soon learns that when you're dealing with unscrupulous people like saloonowner Kent (Brian Donleavy), it doesn't pay to play nice.

Next comes ""Winchester '73"" (1950), a Mann opus and perhaps Stewart's defining Western.  Here he plays Lin McAdam, a Texan trying to track down the brother (Stephen McNally) who went bad and murdered their father.  His search brings him to Dodge City one Fourth of July, where he signs up for a holiday marksmanship contest with a gorgeous Winchester ""One of 1000"" rifle as the prize.  He wins, too, but his brother steals the rifle and flees, and the rest of the film follows the weapon in its subsequent wanderings and Lin in his continued quest until both come together once again.

In ""Bend of the River"" (1952), another Mann film based upon a novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-of-the-Snake/dp/B000JWBBI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend of the Snake</a>&nbsp;by Bill Gulick, his character is Glyn McLyntock, a former Border Raider in 1850's Kansas who has signed on as a guide for a party of Oregon-bound pioneers in an effort to leave that life behind.  After saving Emerson Cole (Douglas Kennedy) from a lynching party and discovering that he too used to ride the Border, he gets his party safe to the valley they're bound for, but the discovery of gold in the neighborhood imperils the delivery of the supplies and cattle for which they've already paid.  It's up to Glyn to get the goods out of the clutches of avaricious merchants, elude miners hungry for them, and cope with a conspiracy by his drivers and the injury of his friend, pioneer leader Jeremy Baile (Jay C. Flippen).

""The Far Country"" (1954), also directed by Mann, finds him playing Jeff Webster, a cold, mercenary cattleman who drives a herd to Skagway, Alaska, during the Yukon gold rush and is swindled out of it by Skagway's crooked sheriff Gannon (John McIntire).  Stealing the beef back, he gets over the border into Canada and makes it to Dawson, but his troubles have just begun as he copes with two women (saloonowner Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the tomboyish French-Canadian Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet), the insistence of his partner Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) that he isn't really as tough as he makes out, and eventually the pursuit of Gannon.

In ""Night Passage"" (1957), directed by James Nielsen from a novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Passage/dp/0380702959/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Passage</a>&nbsp;by Norman A. Fox, he's Grant McLaine, a former railroad troubleshooter who was fired in disgrace after helping a young train robber known as the Utica Kid (Audie Murphy) to escape.  Back in Colorado after two years as a drifting accordion player, he agrees to magnate Ben Kimball's (Flippen) plea that he carry a payroll on his person to end-of-track in hopes that Whitey Harbin (Dan Duryea) and his gang, who are prone to holding up the pay trains, won't search him.  This is perhaps my favorite of the set, notable for gorgeous location scenery, lots of humor, and a long list of wonderful characters, with Duryea at his psychotic best.

The last entry is ""The Rare Breed,"" directed by Western stalwart Andrew V. McLaglen.  Here Stewart plays aging cowhand Sam ""Bulldog"" Burnett, who reluctantly agrees to help English widow Martha Price (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Hillary (Juliet Mills) deliver their polled Hereford bull, Vindicator, to the Texas rancher whose partner has purchased it for him.  At first Sam thinks a ""muley"" bull is a freak, but the Prices' passion for improving the breed ""lights a fire in him"" that ""goes deep,"" and when Alexander Bowen (Brian Keith), a redheaded Scots frontiersman with a burr as thick as a pea soup and a head harder than an anvil, expresses the idea that Vindicator can't possibly survive the Texas climate, Burnett makes him a bet that will change both their lives.  This one also has a generous measure of humor and several great small parts by Western legends such as Ben Johnson, Jack Elam, and Harry Carey, Jr.

If you like Stewart's Westerns and don't have these six films on DVD, this set is the easiest and probably cheapest way to acquire them.  All are thoroughly enjoyable and showcase his full range as an actor.  Stewart fans, and Western fans, shouldn't miss them.",1263427200,16,5689,5.374578177727784

3375200,4,B00157OICS,"I've always been a huge fan of westerns in general, especially those of either James Stewart and/or John Wayne. For the most part, if you were looking for a western that coupled a decent story with both humor and action you went with the Duke. But if you were looking for a grittier, tougher style of western, at least during the 1950's, only James Stewart would do. Of the six films included here, four were released during the 1950's. Only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destry-Rides-Again/dp/B00008CMRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destry Rides Again</a>&nbsp;(1939) &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rare-Breed/dp/B00008CMT1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rare Breed</a>&nbsp;(1966) do not fall within that decade.

What makes this a good collection is that there is no dead weight when it comes to the titles. Each film is a Stewart classic, unlike some of the John Wayne collections out there that included many of his earlier ""B"" movies. Other titles included in this set are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Far-Country/dp/B00008CMSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Far Country</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winchester-73/dp/B00005JLV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winchester '73</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-Of-The-River/dp/B00008CMRL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend Of The River</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Passage/dp/B00008CMT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Passage</a>.

What disappointed me a bit, and the reason I rated the set at 4 starts instead of 5, was that three of the films (Destry, Bend in the River, and especially Winchester 73) are full frame 1.33:1 format. The other three are widescreen formats. I sure would have preferred all six in a widescreen but twas not to be.
