5831878,5,B00DL6ICD2,Very good price and came to my house on time. I would strongly recommend getting this dvd and other Western dvd's from this vendor!,1391299200,,131,4.5
5831879,5,B00DL6ICD2,"Let me first say that Mackenna's Gold is in Widescreen, this is huge news since the original DVD release it's been very hard to find a Widescreen copy of the film.

SONY did a pretty good job on this collection and selecting the films. There are two disks with no special features included. The only movie that isn't in Widescreen is, ""The Mountain Men"" which is in Full frame. This is a pretty good collection of these films for the price under $15.

The specs of the films included are as follows:
-""Mackenna's Gold"" (1968/color/Widescreen/123mins)
Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas, Julie Newmar, Keenan Wynn; Directed by J. Lee Thompson
-""A Man Called Sledge"" (1970/color/Widescreen/92mins)
James Garner, Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins; Directed by Vic Morrow
-""The Man From Laramie"" (1955/color/Widescreen/103mins)
James Stewart, Arthur Kennedy, Donald Crisp; Directed by Anthony Mann
-""The Mountain Men"" (1980/color/Full screen/100mins)
Charlton Heston, Brian Keith; Directed by Richard Lang

Overall this is a good collection and I would recommend it.",1382918400,16,1062,5.463414634146342

5831898,3,B00DL6ICD2,"""Mountain Men"" was laced with profanities from the very beginning. I turned it off after 10  minutes. Just not my cup of tea. The others were OK. ""Mckenna""s Gold"" just wasn't as good as I remembered.  I never really much cared for Jimmy Stewart in westerns anyway. He was a classic ""over emoter"".",1456790400,2,296,4.566037735849057

5831912,5,B00DL6ICD2,"l was distraught when my beloved movie Mackenna's Gold was in FULL SCREEN only when I bought the single disc edition. Accidentally discovered this package and bought it right away. I ripped through the packaging and got my hands on the DVD and with anticipation and my heart beat racing, inserted the disc into my player. There is only one menu that asks you to select one of two movies. There are no scene selection menus. I selected Mackenna's Gold and there it was. In all it's glory, ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN (2.35:1). Dolby Digital 5.1. The picture quality in my opinion seems to be improved over the former full screen edition. There are two movies on this disc but that doesn't hamper the picture quality. I was shocked to notice so many characters, landscapes, and things I had never seen before that I was finally able to enjoy on my 50"" plasma TV. So glad I got this collection. I don't know any of the other movies. Just Mackenna's Gold in widescreen for the first time. Love it!!!",1452038400,4,989,4.593220338983051
