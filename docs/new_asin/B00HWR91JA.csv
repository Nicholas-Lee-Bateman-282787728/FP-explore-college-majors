8636979,4,B00HWR91JA,"One could say that this film rather resembles a racy sit-com TV item, the episodes compressed into a movie, although its origin and funding are, indeed, a film collaboration between Belgium and Qubec. ""Moroccan Gigolos"" is not some desperately cheap film, however, and the production values of this transatlantic motion picture are up to cinema snuff. It's a charming comedy of errors (and of scanty-pants). The plot's three young slackers of the story,who are good friends, one black, another Moroccan, the other Belgium, want to pool their resources to open a snack bar that will give them a steady living while enabling them to quit their crappy jobs. A business realtor reluctantly agrees to lease a small commercial space for their venture. Alas for them, immediately, each of the lads loses his respective ""day job"" or temp work and, with that, the means for the threesome to set up their little eatery venture.

The boys are wondering how they are going to live up to their end of the deal with the realtor-financier, when, together in the car that the Congolese pal, Dd (played by Eddy King), is driving, they have an accident with a female driver. When the lady lures Samir (acted by Reda Chebchoubi) to her apartment to work together on the accident report to file with the police, she turns on to the young man and pays him to have sex with her. The friends realise that they could make enough money within a month to start their business by paying the financier-realtor if, rather than get new low-pay jobs, they all hire themselves out for sex. They settle on ""Moroccan Gigolos"" as their collective moniker and from there things get sexy and complicated, including with Samir's relationship with partner Nicholas' sister, who, on discovering what her Arab beau is up to doing, becomes jealous. Much merriment ensues for all and, the best of it, for the viewer. The boys are seen undressing frequently, but never down to full frontal nudity. They keep their knickers on as the cameras roll. There is no revealing herein more of the action than already recounted, which could cause ""spoilers"" for the potential buyer of the DVD, except to say that by film's end the eatery closes for want of customers, aside from lots of female prostitutes who frequent it out of solidarity with the would-be gigolos, their male colleagues in the flesh trade, as these ""ladies of the night"" perceive them to be to the boys' discomfort.

Although Reda Chebchoubi (as Samir) has the most central role among the gigolo trio, it is Franois Arnaud, the handsome white boy of the gigolo three, who is the actor, male or female, in the film's cast who has attained to the most renown, thanks to such choice acting career opportunities as being in the casts of some films by his fellow Quebecker, Xavier Dolan, the youthful ""Wunderkind"" of Canadian cinema, and for some large roles in TV movies and mega-series, such as in ""The Borgias"" (in which he played worldly and decadent young churchman, Cdl. Cesare Borgia). Not surprisingly, his acting is the best in ""Moroccan Gigolos"", although all of the cast do well by their roles.

The DVD edition of this French-language T.V.A. Films/Filmoption International production viewed (TVA-02002) is decently produced. The English subtitles are well done, although at one point it is necessary to halt viewing in order to go back to the menu to re-launch such helpful aid. The bonus items are limited to a bloopers reel and to what is called a ""making of"" feature but which, at boring length, amounts to no more than some behind-the-scene views of ""Moroccan Gigolos"" being filmed, with too little coherence to justify indicating as a ""Making of 'Moroccan Gigolos'"" explanatory  feature.

This is a charmingly saucy little motion picture, well worth the view if one does not bring outsize expectations to it.",1498348800,,3835,4.88479262672811
