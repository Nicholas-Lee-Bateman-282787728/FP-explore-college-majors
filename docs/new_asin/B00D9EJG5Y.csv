8590971,1,B00D9EJG5Y,"We love Ghost Hunters!  We've been watching since Season One, and when the DVD's became available we couldn't wait to get them. All was fine until around Season Four when Image Entertainment started to produce them. Nothing but problems!!  Lots of defects, shoddy packaging, we actually had one case disintegrate in our hands, the last disc of Season 6, was missing all the episodes from the Sloss Furnace on and the entire Season 8 had to be sent back because it was so bad.

I wish we had taped the programs ourselves, but this is the first time we've had SO MANY problems with a product. I would hope that things might have gotten better but they only got worse.

So as much as I'd LOVE to have this DVD, I'm not willing to take a chance and have to return it like all the others.",1380499200,2,783,4.342465753424658
8590972,3,B00D9EJG5Y,"(1.30.2015 update from 9.15.2013 original; still the same rating with extra disappointments noted)

The first thing you'll notice and not be happy with when you open the case: all four DVDs are stacked on top of each other. I have never encountered anything packed like this before and it's pretty cheap. It was released just this month and my payment of around $17 isn't the cheapest. At least they didn't give two double-sided DVDs and still stack 'em in that way. Hey...why am I trying to find something positive about the way this is packaged? It's bad.

So are the music and sounds. You'll find that the logos before the main-menu are loud and you'll want to turn it down. Then, the menu-music is low and you'll wanna turn it up. However, when an episode begins, it will be much-louder and you'll want to turn it down. Thus, it's best to leave it lower at the start. During the episodes, the sounds/music drown-out the speaking too-much and it's pretty bad at times. Then again, that's how they make the show anyway: lame music and supposedly-eerie sounds ruining everything. Without any subtitles, it's even worse.

As for the episodes, there are sixteen of them. There are four on a disc and each disc will have 'bonus features'. As of this writing, I actually haven't seen any of those. From what I've read, they show unused footage from the episodes on the discs.

One question I have: ""Are they really fan-favourites?"" Another is: ""How did they determine that?"" I wonder if there was a vote to see which episodes would make the compilation. I believe it's just something that was decided based on internet opinions. In any case, whatever a favourite is depends on the viewer. ""Fort Mifflin"" is one of my faves (and that is on here). The ""Absecon Lighthouse"" is another (which isn't here) -- and these two are favourites because they are locations where I've done my own investigations.

I'm was a semi-fan in the earlier seasons. To me, the show grew consistently boring throughout and the standout episodes were few. ""Ghost Adventures"" fared a bit better, but that was also in the beginning. Now, that show is just a comedic/ridiculous shell of what it was and the acting is even more-terrible.

I believe I've found plenty of documentation and videos online to convince with reasonable proof that both shows have faked events on occasion. I am a skeptic 'ghost hunter', interested more in the stories pertaining to a place and the history. I actually have had some experiences I can't explain, yet I am not convinced anything was supernatural. The main point I stand by is that if any 'ghost hunter' ever fakes anything, they lost (and rightfully should) lose credibility in the eyes of everyone. The first two episodes on the first disc (""Myrtles Plantation"" and ""Race Rock Lighthouse"") are ones that have had a lot of debunking videos on the internet.

VARIOUS BITS & THOUGHTS:

- The episodes aren't in an airdate order.

- I did appreciate how they spoke of their purpose of visiting a place is to debunk a 'haunting'. Later, it became obvious that the focus was more on entertainment...yet the debunking parts were what I appreciated the most and were entertainment.

- It's always lame how the team sets up so many cameras...only to start 'wrapping up' in a mere few hours. Using a bunch of cameras and expensive equipment doesn't mean that anybody is doing a
'scientific' investigation.

- When you see the black and white video, I feel that most would believe it's in total darkness and we're watching an infrared video. They shut off lights and investigate --- and too many times, one person would look at another and the other would nod...one would point to a direction and the other looks...or they are walking around without even a handheld camcorder screen to see where they are going. Many times, there is no camera and the mysterious/unknown cameraman is the only one filming. The members see each other almost all the time. Seeing someone just walk to a different location without any hesitation or visual/audio assistance while in 'darkness' is silly. The show shouldn't fool anybody to get us to think that it's in night-vision whenever it's not.

- It would be better to know who's operating the camera(s) that are recording the 'hunters'. Whoever it is should be able to participate as well, at least by saying if they see something unusual. I think it has happened once briefly, but it should be more often.

I wonder: from the footage TAPS reviews, do they include whatever the cameraman has? It seems that anything caught on video comes from camcorders placed elsewhere or from whatever one of the 'hunters' might be holding (like the FLIR thermal cam).

- Both GH and GA have ridiculous, annoying sounds or music meant to add tension but they just interfere with the investigation. GH has always been bad in this area. GA seemed to be better in the beginning and appeared more serious, yet that was then. Everyone loves to say to someone ""Did you hear that?"" and I find myself saying ""Yeah, it sounded like some lame sound effect."" There's too much whispering and crap. I'm thinking ""Shut the heck up! Say something outloud if needed and announce that it's you saying it!""

- I chuckle when people try to say they are there to 'help' the ghosts. They are there to help themselves by getting scary footage for the audience. As well, nobody saying something is going to be able to do anything to help a 'spirit'. GH: ""I'm here to help. Go to the light."" SPIRIT: ""Hey, thanks! I would have never figured that out on my own."" GH: ""No problem. Even though it would have been better for viewers, I'm glad you responded so I didn't have to provoke you as a way of helping.""

- I've been annoyed with GH whenever they supposedly caught great video footage or a neat audio experience and it wasn't even shared in 'The Reveal' segment with the people at the property. I
recognize a few times that I said to the TV ""Hey, what about that other finding?!?""

- To me, I think it's funny they have TAPS shirts; hats; the logo on the equipment cases; identification on their 'headquarters'; jackets (like they are wearing uniforms) and they attempt to make it like they are a real business. Props to GA for not doing that, at least. I more-likely believe that TAPS charges people for the investigations and that's lame.

- Episode 4 on disc 1: CASHTOWN INN

Going over the 'evidence', they let Grant and Jay hear something. One guy, in the basement, asked a question to the air ""Do you miss your family?"" and says that he hears a 'yeah' or 'yes'. They show the sound's wave/form on a computer screen, the guys listen through headphones, but the audience will hear nothing. So, we just have to believe them when they claim they heard something. They try and play the audio later for someone at the property, but even with volume enhancement it's basically nothing -- and the person listening to supposed evidence didn't even acknowledge by voice or appearance that he heard anything unusual.

- Episode 1 on disc 2: STANLEY HOTEL

When Jason's in his room sleeping, the bedroom door opens and a glass on the nightstand has a piece broken. He awakens...notices both...puts the camera on the nightstand facing the bedroom door and gets back in bed. The door isn't shut and you can see it open. Then, in just a few moments, the door's shut (editing). I thought it was all happening right then and thought ""Didn't he hear that?"" Later, at about 5:48am (I think), he eventually gets up and nothing is mentioned about the door being shut. I was like ... ""Well, someone else came into that room.""

During 'The Reveal', we see the door shutting long after he gets into bed. During the first time, though, it had the look of a mistake to me. Still, seeing the door shut isn't anything. From the camera's view, there is a lot of cover for a person to hide and shut the door somehow.

I hated when they talk like it's fact that there are most-likely rocks in the area that can 'record' stuff (an idea that certain types of stones assist in residual haunting -- which is another theory where some ghosts are not entities, but a imprint on the environment that replays over and over and doesn't interact).

- Episode 1 on disc 1: MYRTLES PLANTATION

We have Jason and Grant using the FLIR thermal camera (showing temperatures of objects). A supposed spirit quickly passes in front of the camera. When it comes back from where the commercial normally would be, they are showing the footage -- yet, somehow, the audience is seeing it in black in white (like it was shown with a regular night-vision recording). Why would anybody have altered something this way?

When we had J & G in a room, there's a table between them with a lamp. You see the cord and it's leading pretty-much straight back. There a picture of some kind leaning on the table and against the wall. The scene breaks away to a couple other folks and comes back to J & G. Now, Jay's lying in a bed and Grant's still where he was. The lamp's cord is not, however. It's now no-longer near the picture/item and is draped over the side toward Grant. Later footage shows that the lamp is moving. A debunking vid points out the changes in the cord's position and how the tablecloth was changed.

In conclusion, I was mostly disappointed with this compilation. The audio issues and poor packaging of the media are the flaws of the physical product. I enjoyed the collection, however, when I take it as a good selection of 'fraud favourites' and it's amusing. The first two episodes on the disc have segments that have been debunked and, as a skeptic, I find it all interesting. I have been intrigued by a few things, but I'll always go back to how it's been shown to my satisfaction that evidence has been faked/created. This undermines the entire show.

It's just an entertainment show and there is nothing proving that any devices are actually recording spirits. There are believers who imagine they are contacting others from other dimensions using the same products and there's nothing to say that they are right or wrong. Heck, some people use the same devices during UFO hunts, so it's all just speculation.

Two main questions to ask yourself when ghost hunting: ""Did it REALLY happen?""; ""Did you WANT it to happen?"". It's interesting how I could be with a team of folks who are surprised when I don't experience the same thing as they. Again, I am a skeptic but have had some strange occurrences I can't explain...so nobody can just say that ""You didn't experience something others had because you didn't WANT something to happen.""

I give this product three out of five stars, which means ""it's okay"" according to Amazon.",1379203200,2,10693,4.666312433581297
