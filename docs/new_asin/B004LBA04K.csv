8434150,1,B004LBA04K,"While I agree that it gives a good oversight on the history of witchcraft and its principles. The Magick Rituals of the Coven has nothing to do with giving you information about actually doing rituals. If you think this is an instructional dvd, its not. It is kindof like watching an A&E or History channel special.  If your interested in the history of witchcraft and what they believe its a good start, otherwise, don't waste your money.",1396828800,,439,4.701298701298701
8434151,5,B004LBA04K,I was facinated by the whole thing. I learned a great deal though it is not what I practice it did clarify some things for me.,1376006400,,126,3.8846153846153846
8434152,4,B004LBA04K,This shows the other side of witchcraft. I'm talking about the side that isn't portrayed in Hollywood films and tv shows. Highly informative and showed me a different dimension of witchcraft.,1368921600,,191,5.193548387096774
8434153,5,B004LBA04K,I would bet a lot of people are like me and have a total misperception of what magick is all about. This is a glimpse into the world of witches that was very illuminating.  Unless you know someone who is practicing and they have explained their belief system and rituals I think you will be very surprised as I was.,1368835200,,315,4.25
8434154,3,B004LBA04K,"The interview is well laid out and informative, but if you are an  old timer you may find this film a bit of a snooze.",1356307200,2,118,3.72
8434155,4,B004LBA04K,I had no idea that there are still so many people that practice which craft. My opinion of Witchcraft was always that it was a supernatural belief and was practiced to do harm to society. This DVD made me realize that there are actually positive practices that help and heal people.  Not all witches are evil. I really enjoyed this film.,1307059200,7,337,4.524590163934426
