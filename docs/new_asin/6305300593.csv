That being said, this movie is torture. Even with the addition of Martin Sheen (the Sheens must owe Christopher a favor, Charlie appeared in his masterpiece ""Deadfall""), and finally a speaking role for Christopher Coppola staple Billy Floyd, this movie is dreadfully bad. Watching this movie, a friend and I cried out to the heavens begging for mercy, and another friend left rather than finish watching it. However, if you do foolishly decide to endure this trial, do not give up. At the end of the movie, Robert Carradine delivers the most unbelievable look, outside of a beer commercial, ever captured on film. It's like the punchline to 90 minute joke. The bad thing is, the joke's on you.",980812800,9,851,4.835616438356165

7887199,1,6305300593,"""Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny"" now has a rival for the title of Most Appalling Film Ever Made. If Gunfighter were tongue-in-cheek it could have been a decent comedy/satire, but apparently the film wants us to take it seriously. Well, seriously, it is hilarious.",1481760000,,262,4.844444444444444

7887203,3,6305300593,"This movie may not have been the best western I've seen,but it wasn't the worst. They could have left out Martin Sheen & Robert Carradine. Hopalong was more like the character created by Clarence Mulford & not William Boyd's portrayal of him. I'm not saying anything bad about Boyd's portrayal. I have several of his Cassidy movies on DVD,& I enjoy his laugh. He portrayed him as a non-drinker,none-smoker(helped him in real life),but Mulford's Cassidy drank,smoked & was a little wild. He was in his 20's.red hair,medium height. I approached it with an open mind. It was entertaining & fast moving. I'll watch it again. If you never read Mulford's book's,read them so you can maybe appreciate the movie.",1357257600,,704,4.92436974789916
7887204,5,6305300593,"If you liked the B Westerns from the Golden Age of Westerns, chances are that you will enjoy this movie.  If you have Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy movies in your collection, you will enjoy this modern updated telling of the B Western classic story filmed and acted in the B Western style.  The hero is named Hopalong Cassidy and the movie says that it was ""inspired"" by the novel ""Bar 20,"" published by Clarence E. Mulford in 1907.

It was produced by Francis Ford Coppola, which may have led some reviewers to anticipate a western that was along the lines of his Godfather movies.  Instead, this is a pure and simple a homage to the Republic B Westerns, adding modern film techniques and great photography.  The acting is good, but it is done in the very best Republic style of Rocky Allen Lane.  The dialog also follows a pattern reminiscent of the old Monogram classics.

The story is simple.  The Bar 20 is hit hard by the meanest of bad men and the cattle and Hoppy's somewhat neglected girlfriend (he has been too busy doing good deeds) are both abducted.  It's Hoppy to the rescue to get the cattle and his girl back, and to give the bad guys what they deserve.  This modern B Western includes great special effects and the outright killing of bad guys.  But, as in all B Westerns, the ending has Hoppy, Red and the gang showing that good triumphs over bad.

If you don't like B Westerns, save your money on this DVD (even though the price is ridiculously low). If you remember Wild Bill Elliott, the Durango Kid and Lash LaRue, then this movie is for you.",1321747200,2,1578,4.45993031358885

*It's extremely hilarious in an unintentional way.

The Bad Things
*Action scenes are not all that thrilling (and are rather silly).
*Filming style is poor (although I found the composition of some shots really funny).
*Characters are cliched and forgettable.
*Plot is simple and rather dumb.
*I found the whole spiel with the magic gunfighting gloves ridiculous.

This movie is so bad that it's hilarious.  The characters, filming, plot, and overall film is completely laughable.  That may be good for some, but this is definately not good quality filmmaking.

The DVD has poor video quality, for it has a lot of graininess, haze, fuzziness, and poor colors.  The sound is kind of bad too.  Disc is in widescreen (I forget whether or not it's anamorphic), and has no special features (maybe a trailer, but nothing more).",1219449600,,837,4.9784172661870505
7887206,3,6305300593,"Ok, Yes, it's a little 'cheesy'.  Kinda reminds you of the Roy Rogers days, but it's a cute film.  Chris (Hopalong) is my cousin, and I'll admit I just wanted to see it because he was in it.  He reminds me of a young Lee Majors.  It was great to see him on my TV screen in something other than the rodeo (like back in the 80's).  I enjoyed every minute of it!",1188345600,,359,3.863013698630137
7887207,4,6305300593,"After all the harsh reviews, I was a little worried about watching the movie, but I ended up really liking it.  If you knew how small of a budget there was on this movie, you'd be impressed at how resourceful the director was.  I found the movie inspiring because it showed you don't have to have millions to make a good movie.  And it was good.  Strong plot and great visuals.  Watch and let the movie paint a picture for you.",1150502400,,427,4.222222222222222
