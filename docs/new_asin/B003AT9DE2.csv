4104656,2,B003AT9DE2,"This was a very disappointing DVD. I'm a big Donnie Yen fan so when I read the description of this DVD and some of the reviews, I thought it was a no-brainer. Well, user LoBo hit the nail on the head - not much action at all in this movie. I think there is 1 fight scene in the first 100mins (out of 138mins) and even that is over much too quickly. The action starts to pick up towards the end but the scenes feel like they were cut short or unfinished because they are very quick and don't make much sense. There are a couple of bodyguards (I don't want to spoil it for any who might actually want to see this movie) who you think will certainly kick some butt and make for some good action...but they have a couple of quick scenes and then thats it. Its a huge letdown. Donnie Yen has a couple of quick fight scenes in the whole movie and they're not even that exciting - he's not playing a martial arts master/expert as he has in many of his other movies. The action aside, the English subtitles are very poorly written. They're so bad that its extremely hard to follow the plotline by reading them as there are some very obvious grammer/spelling errors and many sentences don't make any sense. If the movie was more visually exciting (i.e. fight scenes, etc) then the subtitles wouldn't be as big of a deal but it makes the movie that much worse. The whole production feels strung together and very poorly edited - almost like they ran out of money during production and pieced together what they could to get it released. Do yourself a favor and skip this DVD. As it stands, I wasted 138mins of my life that I'll never get back and I wouldn't want you to do the same. Thanks for reading.",1284940800,3,1692,4.274143302180685
4104657,4,B003AT9DE2,"I love this movie. This is as good as Ip Man and better than Ip Man 2. The only minus is that I thought this DVD can play both cantonese and mandarin, but found out that it can only play in mandarin.",1281139200,21,199,3.761904761904762
4104658,1,B003AT9DE2,"Very disappointing film. This film last`s 138 min. In my opinion it was at least 45 min too long. I find it a overlong film!. i think it had too little action. When a action showed up, i think it was poor. Even the drama and story was very boring. I like some Drama films and tv series, but i think this was not any good Drama. I think it should be renamed to Boringguards and Assassins.

I think the camera angles and editing also was poor. It was hard to follow the action. I thought this film would be action packed, considering Donnie was in it. I don`t think it was. With all that money, how could they make such a bad film? I don`t know how they managed to do that. Also, donnie wears a silly unconvincing bald-cap making his head look like a watermelon. Hahaa.

It has only max 15 min of action out of 138 min. I felt cheated since, before it was released it was promoted as having 1 hour of action. More drama film than action film. I will never watch this film again. See only this if you like a boring drama film with very little action. Watch Ip Man instead, than this junk. I think it does at least have much better, story, acting, and fight scenes.",1268352000,3,1161,4.155555555555556
4104659,5,B003AT9DE2,"This is a great movie. It has a good pseudo-historical story about Sun Yat-Sen visiting Hong Kong in 1906 to plan a revolution against the empress and the government of China. The empress when she learns of the visit dispatches a small army of ninjas to assassinate him. The first hour of the film introduces the location, the very diverse characters and the story. The second hour is non-stop action as Sun arrives, the ninjas and their fearsome leader attempt to kill him, and the motley group of characters we've been introduced to attempt to thwart them and save Sun. There's a lot of heroism and loyalty on display here, and some unforgettable fight scenes. The one that pits Donnie Yen against the ninja champion is probably the most thrilling because he has the skills but the others are powerful,too. In every respect this movie is exceptional, the direction, the acting, the cinematography, the set creation, and the scoring. It's a classic.",1266883200,30,950,4.87037037037037

I am a huge fan of Asian films and Donnie Yen so this was a must have for me when it was released. This film follows a group in China that want to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. I love historical films even if they do stretch true and fact. As long as the film is entertaining then I am all about it. This film had everything going for it, based on true events or people and had wonderful actors in it. So when this was first released on DVD I bought it and watched it the first night along with my brother who is also a fan of this stuff.

While the film was marketed as and looks like from the cover and poster as an action film it really isn't until the final act. This film is more of an historical drama with liberties taken of course but it is a very good film. In fact action star Donnie Yen gets to show off his acting chops here along with his fighting skills, great mix. In fact the entire film is full of great acting from a wonderful ensemble cast, excellent work.

The film is story driven like I said but once that final act gets going there is plenty of great action. The fights here are wonderfully done including a showdown between two of my favorites, Donnie Yen and MMA star Cung Le. Also it should be noted that the final act while action packed is still very dramatic and at times heartbreaking considering what happens with certain characters.

I would definitely recommend this film to any movie lover out there especially if you like Asian films or any of the stars found here. The DVD comes with behind the scenes features and interviews along of course with different audio tracks depending on what you want. This is a really great film and worth a watch in my opinion.",1415232000,2,1718,4.29320987654321

4104690,5,B003AT9DE2,"Bias Alert!!! I am a die hard martial arts fan with over 300 in my personal collection. Adding to that bias is my fondness for Donnie Yen and my great desire to see action films. But the reason this reaches the level of 5 stars is because the storyline and the acting are both exceptional. This is the story of the revolutionary movement of 1905 in Hong Kong, China. I really like the way in which the director shows how this revolt touches the lives of different families both rich and poor. But if you know anything about my reviews. I am an action film specialist and the fight scenes in this film are extremely good and that is because there are several top notched fighters in this film. And although hand to hand is my first love in martial arts films. The action sequences in this film go well beyond that with arrows, knives, explosions, swords and more. Another thing that makes the action sequences so good is that the audience will truly believe that these people are willing to die for this cause.",1409011200,5,1009,4.45945945945946

It is a long movie so make sure that you use the toilet before sitting down with the popcorn and soda.  Some fight scenes you'll have to take with a grain of salt as they slide into some of the ridiculous with the jumping around and flying all over the place.

But it is a well laid plot of those trying to bring China out of the feudal age into the Twentieth Century.  A great film for those into history and martial arts mayhem.",1389484800,,650,4.126984126984127

4104709,5,B003AT9DE2,"It takes place in Hong Kong in 1905, just before the beginning of the Chinese Revolution (1906-1911).  It involves mostly fictional characters, but a few of the characters are based on reality.

This is a Wuxia film in spirit, if not literally.  Classic Wuxia has one or more masters protecting the peasants from the powers-that-be.  This has every-day people protecting Sun Wen from Qing assasins.

This is a beautifully acted and directed film; it is visually beautiful and the action scenes are very believable.  Special notice goes to Donnie Yen, who plays a complex character that starts the film as a mercenary, but ends up giving up his life to protect Sun Wen.

I have two versions of this wonderful movie.  The movie is largely the same between the versions, but one has better English Subtitles and annotations.  As an example, in one scene where the police chief is offering to escort Li Yutang and his entourage for a part of their journey, in one version it calls it a police escort;  in the other it is called 'police brutality'.  I expect the correct translation would be closer to 'police protection'.  Even for the good translation, there are inconsistencies:  for some reason one, two, three is translated to three, two, one.

The good translation is distributed by Mega Star / Media Asia / Cinema Popular.  Subtitles are Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English.

I was reminded on America's revolutionary war.  In both there is the fight against governmental oppression of the people and the freedom to choose you leaders.

An all-star cast brings to life the story of revolutionaries and imperialists planning for the brief return to Hong Kong of an exile from Japan who, in one hour, is going to set in motion the wheels of an all out rebellion on mainland China.

The first half of the movie is a pure drama, introducing a lot of characters and fully fleshing out their motivations and relationships with each other. The story of the movie is not especially meaty, but by turning it into such a character piece it more than makes up for it. It was completely involving and a joy to watch.

Near the end of the first half of the movie, my adrenaline was already up for the second half. The pace was perfect, and it built up wonderfully to what I thought was the film's climax.

Instead, it turned out that it wasn't the climax, but that the entire second of the movie is brutally action packed. Having become successfully invested in the characters during the first half, this was some truly gripping stuff. The action direction is top-notch as well, absolutely pulse-pounding.

I was a little sorry to see the story is largely fictionalized because the story is so very good.  The title is a tad misleading:  this is a story about an important period in Chinese history, condensed down to  5 days.  Some of the figures are historical, but the actual occurrences (except for the summary of the following few years) are not.  Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

This is a beautiful film.  Wonderful performances from an ensemble cast.  If you are deeply affected by self-sacrifice, the desire of a parent to protect his or her children, redemption and painful irony, you will deeply affected by this film.  Besides the performances, the film is visually beautiful (not on the level of Hero, but getting there).

It doesn't matter where the person is from, the concept of dying for one's country, friends and family can make even 17 year-old boys brave enough to stand their ground (in this case it meant not fighting at all, simply having the courage to be - I won't say any more than that so readers can enjoy the story.)

4104739,5,B003AT9DE2,"This is a ""martial arts film"" in only the broadest sense of the word.  True, it has action and fight scenes, and yes, they involve mostly martial arts, with some guns thrown in.  Nevertheless, it is first and foremost a human drama exploring the REASONS why people make the ultimate choices.

You have a sage, established businessman with a bright son who has a chance to shape the future by going off to college, and an assortment of individuals who either have squandered their potential for various reasons, or are, by their own choice, living lives other than what their talents deserve.  You also have a servant (Rickshaw driver) who is totally loyal to his master and son (""young master""), and this trumps all, including a new bride.  Finally, you have Dr. Sun, who promises all a new future without oppression--and in reality is a ""minor"" character in that he has little screen time, yet is the entire basis of what drives the other characters.  Their stories are revealed and the entire spectrum of humanity is explored in this single film. On the other side you have the established imperials, who are motivated by their desire to keep status quo.

Much like ""Master and Commander"",  which explores how individuals act when put in the ultimate stressful situations, with no alternatives (some nobly and bravely, others weakly and cowardly, but all to their own natures), we see in this wrongfully titled movie a story of individual people, with individual lives and individual stories, each of whom is motivated by different things: money, power, greed, blind loyalty, nationalism, or a sense of right--and wrong.  Despite the different motivations, the goal is essentially the same one.

Where do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?  If you have a chance at happiness for yourself and family do you take it?  Or do what is best for everyone?  And at what cost?  And how do your decisions affect others?  Do your REASONS for doing what you do actually matter in the end?  Or are your actions sufficient to define you?

This comes out beautifully in this film and is what sets it apart from other so called ""martial arts"" films.  It is truly a brilliant piece of cinema, and is well worth viewing.",1328227200,3,2222,4.757180156657963
4104740,3,B003AT9DE2,"""Bodyguards and Assassins"" is an ambitious movie attempting to be two things at once. While with its all-star ensemble cast and a gorgeous set, the film tries to be an emotionally-charged, character-driven drama, it also strives to satisfy the action-flick fans providing martial arts action sequences. The end result is a mixed bag, a deeply flawed film that is still worth checking out for the stars' names and their fine acting as well as some effective action scenes.

Set in 1905, ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" follows the story of a group of bodyguards (mostly ordinary citizens) rallied to protect Sun Wen, a Chinese revolutionary and political leader who will arrive in Hong Kong for a secret meeting with other revolutionaries in a few days. But the China's Qing Dynasty also knows the plans and sends out assassins to murder Sun Wen.

The film's earlier part (more than one hour) is devoted to introducing the backgrounds of characters and building up the dramatic tension by focusing their conflicts. Acting is all top-notch. I was most impressed with Tony Leung Ka-fai playing a newspaper editor Chen Shaobai and Wang Xueqi as his financial backer (and old friend) Li Yutang. Nicholas Tse as a rickshaw driver is also memorable. A gambling-addicted police officer Shen Chongyang (Donnie Yen) in the pay of the dynasty is also very good.

But for all the effective acting the ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" is far from perfect. The film's weakness lies in the screenplay, which fails to convince us the characters' motives to sacrifice everything for Sun Wen. Yes, I know, Sun Wen is a political leader who plays an important role in the modern history of China (as seen in a recent film ""1911""), but historical knowledge is not enough for us to relate to them especially when here Sun Wen as a character is hardly fleshed out.

But more serious problem is that the bodyguards' plans to protect the convoy are vague at best. We are told the bodyguards must protect Sun Wen no matter what it costs, but we don't know much about how they intend to achieve that. As a consequence the latter half of the film looks as if the story doesn't know where it is going. There are several nice action set-pieces (Donnie Yen and Leon Lai are standout), but somehow they lack thrills and excitement because we know how their battles would end anyway.

To call ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" an action movie is misleading. Though it contains action, the movie is also about the dramas of the people. That is not a bad idea, but perhaps the film could have been better with a bit more emphasis on either the former aspect or the latter.",1327104000,,2620,4.787610619469026
4104741,5,B003AT9DE2,"I can't imagine how the few that have rated this film badly could come to that impression, unless they simply wanted gratuitous fight scenes and nothing else.

This was a truly epic and extremely well done film.

Yes, I admit to having purchased it with the expectation that it would be a fairly cheesy fight flick. But, I could not have been more pleased with the film. It is a deep and involving drama with a smattering of martial arts that can only be described as Epic.

As others have said, if you want a ""kung fu flick"", look somewhere else. If you want a well executed dramatic action film set in early 20th century Hong Kong, this is something you should not miss.",1325462400,2,672,4.403225806451613
4104742,4,B003AT9DE2,"I wasn't sure if I should rate this 3 or 4 stars.  I went with 4 because the movie had emotional impact.  While the movie spends most if its time building plot and character, this does pay off. In other words, it can be slow. By the time the action kicks in, you will care about the characters.  You cheer for them and worry as they run a gauntlet of danger.  Unfortunately, the time spent on character and plot may bore some people.  This is, after all, billed as a martial arts film.  The martial arts do show up, in the later half.  However, the fights are well done with different styles and various fights (by some well known names!), and because of the character development, breathtaking.  You want the heroes to win.  You need these people with pasts, tragedies, issues, and courage to win.  I won't tell you how it ends.  However, I will say, if you want a movie about sacrifice, love, honor, redemption, with some kick rear martial arts, I  think you have found the movie.",1317340800,6,982,4.424581005586592
4104743,5,B003AT9DE2,"This is not Donnie's usual ""rock 'em, sock 'em"" film.  It is an attempt to represent an aspect of modern Chinese history that most Westerners, Americans particularly, know little about.  The plot deals with a visit by Dr. Sun Yat Sen to Southern China in an attempt to gain control over an increasingly chaotic situation.  The movie is well filmed, and the director has a sense of the necessity for characters to have some depth, and not just the ability to perform the film versions of martial arts movement.  While not, perhaps, for everyone's permanent martial arts film library, it is well worth at least one viewing.",1316649600,7,621,4.775700934579439
4104744,3,B003AT9DE2,"Whenever I find myself getting lost in conversations with other people about martial arts films one of the guys that always seems to get glossed over is Donnie Yen. He's just as good as the Bruce Lees, the Jackie Chans, the Jet Lis, and Tony Jaas out there, but for some reason he's just never really been able to click with the mainstream. Yen seemed to stick around wuxia films longer than the names you probably associate with these types of movies and extravagant wirework is usually the first thing to make an action film feel mediocre to me. People can't fly around, run on the tips of blades of grass, or kick people seventeen times in the air before landing on their feet and doing it all over again; the more realistic an action film is the more enjoyable it is to me. But ever since Hero (yes it's a wuxia film, but it's one of the exceptions), Donnie Yen has put out some really fantastic action films that are either more grounded or the wirework involved is a lot more subtle. Kill Zone and Flash Point were two of the films that made me love the guy's work and Ip Man is easily one of my favorite martial arts films of all time. Most Yen projects not only have spectacular action sequences, but have an engaging story to tell as well and that's something action films like this usually don't bother trying to do. Bodyguards and Assassins just tends to focus more on the dramatic side of things rather than just punch you in the face, kick you in the gut, and move on to the next action scene.

Bodyguards and Assassins is a bit misleading. It's marketed as this martial arts epic and it really isn't. It's actually incredibly similar to 13 Assassins in the way that nearly all of the action is in the last hour of the movie. Most of the movie is spent planning Sun Wen's arrival. The movie takes place during the early 1900s when plans were set into motion to try and overthrow the Qing Dynasty which had become corrupt. Sun Wen was the man believed to be the revolutionary and first step toward that goal. So while many Chinese are willing to step up to the cause and see China become a democracy, there are others who want China to remain the way it is; some want to protect him while many want to kill him. This movie is even more of a slow burn than 13 Assassins was. A man gets shot in the opening scene, there's a brief fight scene where more characters get killed, but the rest of the first hour of the film is very dialogue heavy that is sure to make action junkies itch for their fix.

The other misleading part of the film is Donnie Yen getting top billing. He does play a key supporting role, but is probably only around on-screen for thirty to forty minutes. His character is probably the most well-developed though. Yen is Sum Chang-Yang; a compulsive gambler who will do anything for money. His wife left him after their daughter was born because she didn't want to see their child have the same fate as her father. He's basically a lowlife the entire movie until he has the opportunity to make something of himself and finally gets to see his daughter up close. Then it's as if his entire life was spent waiting for this moment and he decides he shouldn't waste it. So while Yen does make the most of his screen time, he's secondary to the bigger issue at hand.

Bodyguards and Assassins falls victim to shaky camera techniques during a good portion of the fight scenes. The technique is probably used to make the viewer feel closer to the action, but it just doesn't work. It makes you miss more of the action rather than make you feel like you're a part of it. The other disappointment is that there is quite a lot of CG blood in the movie. Most of the blood that makes it to the ground is obviously made with practical effects, but all of it that flies into the air is computer generated. CG blood just gives a movie like this a cartoonish feel, when it's supposed to be taken seriously.

The last hour does have at least two scenes to try and make up for that wordy first hour. There's a chase scene that evolves into a fight scene involving Donnie Yen in the marketplace that is exactly what you've been craving since the movie began. It's probably Yen's crowning achievement in the movie. Leon Lai plays a beggar in the film named Liu Yubai who was outcast from his rich family after falling in love with his father's woman. He uses a metal fan when he fights and he's extremely skilled with it. His action scene is quite spectacular as well and it nearly trumps Yen's.

Bodyguards and Assassins is not a bad film by any means; it's very story driven, has an excellent cast, and delivers an incredibly powerful message. But labeling it solely as an action film seems really unfair. It's a historical drama featuring some action sequences. Impatient viewers may turn the film off before it really has the chance to take off while a shaky camera and CG blood does bring the movie down a notch or two, but there is light at the end of that tunnel for martial arts admirers. Donnie Yen fans may also be slightly disappointed once they realize Yen only has a supporting role. Nevertheless Bodyguards and Assassins is a riveting drama with an unbelievable climax that captures the look and feel of Hong Kong during the early 1900s in exquisite fashion.

The special features on the DVD are kind of weird, so bear with me. First up are five Making of featurettes. ""The Characters"" is about twenty one minutes long and gives a brief look at the characters The Revolutionary, The Tycoon, The Diva, The Fugitive, The Rickshawman, The Fiancee, The Heir, The Hawker, The Policeman, The Beggar, The Assassin, The Concubine, and The Gambler. Each actor and cast member bleeds not only enthusiasm for the project but passion, as well. You're treated to quite a bit of interesting information during this feature including the fact that the film was nearly ten years in the making. During The Gambler portion of the feature, you get an in-depth look at Donnie Yen's astounding marketplace fight scene that's a great watch. ""The Set"" is nearly three minutes long. The set was built from the ground up and took six months to build. It portrays Hong Kong during the early 1900s very realistically. ""The Design"" is just under two minutes long. It goes into detail concerning the extent of the costume designs including the police uniforms. Leon Lai also discusses how he crushed up bean curd with honey and smothered himself with it to try and be more in character. ""The Make-Up"" is a minute and a half long. We take a look at Nicholas Tse, Hu Jun, and Donnie Yen as they each tell their stories of sitting in the make up chair during production. Donnie Yen spent four hours putting on make-up and one hour taking it off every day. Hu Jun had prosthetics added to his forehead and nose to make his nose crooked. ""The Action"" is about four and a half minutes long. It briefly takes a look at the action director using storyboards for most of the action sequences before the feature recycles the same behind the scenes marketplace fight footage from ""The Characters"" featurette.

There are also four extended interviews totaling a little over ten minutes in length altogether. Leon Lai goes into detail about his beggar character while telling the story about he became part of the production. We're also shown behind the scenes footage of his action sequence being shot. Wang Xueqi portrayed Li Yu-Tang and discusses his first time working with a Taiwanese and Hong Kong cast. Tony Ka-Fai Leung played Chen Xiao-Bai and talks about portraying a revolutionary pushing 30 years old when he's well over 30 himself. Finally there's the producer Peter Chan who created the concept of the film ten years ago when the movie market was very different and wouldn't have been mature enough for a film like this. The DVD also contains the international trailer, as well.

The funky part comes in the form of a QR code on the DVD. You scan it with your android phone and it takes you to a website that's supposed to feature more bonus material. There's a mailing list you can sign up for that supposedly mails you a clue leading to a new reward in the form of bonus material. The only video on the site at the moment is Tony Ka-Fai Leung's two minute extended interview.

The Bodyguards and Assassins DVD is not rated, but is presented in Mandarin with English subtitles, is available in 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Stereo sound, and is presented in widescreen. It is approximately 139 minutes long and should be available in both retail stores and most online retailers now.",1312070400,42,8579,4.54398447606727
4104745,3,B003AT9DE2,"a great flick, suprisingly deep and emotional and well done. However with a name like ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" and starring(?) Donnie Yen, it has very few fight scenes, and they are not at all realistic. This movie would have been good if it had been titled ""Chinese Revolution Drama""",1311984000,,286,4.857142857142857
4104746,4,B003AT9DE2,"Judge Josh Rode, DVD Verdict -- ""What we get for the first half is an expose of a man who tries to straddle an increasingly pointed fence between his corrupt government and his conscience. The film sets up the showdown between these ""bodyguards"" and the Qing assassins. While this does build a feeling of tension, there is generally very little action in these early scenes. Although that's not necessarily bad. We get some very good acting, major character development (when's the last time you could say that about a martial arts film?), and backstories on the major players which range from interesting to just kinda stupid. When the payoff finally comes, it does so with a vengeance. Each of the bodyguards gets his (or her) moment to shine, which is great because it makes every one of them pivotal to the film. The best battle of the movie (and possibly the best I've ever seen), between Yen and American MMA champion Cung Le (Tekken), is not the climax, which seems odd for a martial arts film but fits the ""this isn't really a true kung fu movie"" direction of this one to a T. The 2.35:1 transfer is clean with a clear picture even in the darker scenes. The 5.1 Mandarin track is strong, but if you're a fan of dubbing (this film has the best lip-synchronization I've seen in a long time) you'll be stuck with a Dolby 2.0 stereo track. The extras are repetitive, using the same interview quotes and scene clips throughout the behind-the-scenes featurettes. The most interesting parts are about the Hong Kong circa 1906 set that they built exclusively for this movie. It is absolutely astounding and I wish they had gone into more detail about it. Bodyguards and Assassins is a step up from your normal kung fu/martial arts film. It builds actual characters we care about and has a reasonably complex and engaging plot. That, combined with the extended race-and-chase interspersed with great fighting to finish the film, makes it all worth it in the end.""",1310256000,15,1962,4.723032069970846
4104747,1,B003AT9DE2,"This movie shouldn't be watched.  Instead, all DVDs, copies and any original film should be gathered together in a large metal container, which should be filled up with all manner of flammable liquids and then ignited.  After all that remains are ashes....those ashes should then be gathered up and placed in a steel reinforced concrete container and then dropped into the deepest trench in the ocean.  And then...we should train a herd of aggressive giant squids, poisonous manta rays and supper violent man-eating sharks to constantly patrol the container of ash...just to be sure some idiot doesn't try to resurrect this movie in any way.  It was that bad.

What someone could have done to make this movie better before releasing it into the world: (1) Remove all ""fighting"" scenes.  This movie contained possibly the worst set of fighting ever witnessed by humans.  I would venture to say that the lame Kung Fu tv series had better fight scenes.  Seriously...It was that bad. (2) Since all fighting/action scenes are to be removed (see #1 above), then remove the actors that were supposed to ""fight"" as well.  As I type this out, I am now wondering if that was even the real Donnie Yen in the movie.  Since part of this movie's plot is that there is someone pretending to be Dr. Sun (who all the bad guys/girls want to kill), perhaps that was a clue for us that there was someone pretending to be Donnie Yen.  Maybe this was really Donnie Yawn?  (3) Take the marketing/advertising/PR people that came up with statements that adorned the dvd cover - (""Martial Arts Extravaganza Wall-To-Wall Action"" and ""A Full-On Fists-Bared Kung Fu Film"" ) and use them to help train the aforementioned Gang of Aquatic Creatures For Making Sure that No One Ever Attempts to Pull This Film Out of the Ocean Trench...of course, their participation in the training would be to act as live bait.
