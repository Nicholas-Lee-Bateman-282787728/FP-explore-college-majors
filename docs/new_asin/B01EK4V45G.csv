7736754,5,B01EK4V45G,"This DVD is so serene. The colors are so beautiful and so vivid. It's amazing the images they have captured on video. I would recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to see the amazing beauty of the underwater world. There are 5 films to choose from or play them all together. You can play them individually with the choices of music, waves, or music and sea sounds.  It really is captivating!",1469664000,,393,4.458333333333333
7736755,5,B01EK4V45G,The Coral Tranquility DVD is excellent for background or watching with a critical eye. The photography is outstanding. It is very relaxing and a great way to get some quality time.,1468108800,3,180,4.838709677419355
7736756,5,B01EK4V45G,"With this DVD you can discover the beauty of the sea in several films. We see lots of different fish, sea horses, turtles and whole schools of fish in a wonderful colored underwater world and you can choose as an accompaniment between relaxing piano music, the sounds of the sea, or both. I was very impressed by the cute sea horses, which can be viewed at close range. A very nice DVD in which I really like the excellent colors.",1466640000,,430,4.3875
7736757,5,B01EK4V45G,"Four different scenes to choose from that each offer something different from colorful coral to breathtakingly beautiful scenes of the ocean at night.  I enjoyed the different varieties of sea creatures on this DVD and the lovely music added to my enjoyment.

This is one of the best ocean scene videos I've seen.  The video footage of the ocean at night was something that I've rarely seen on any of my nature videos and it was both unique and brilliantly filmed.  I enjoyed the dancing seahorses as they frolicked through the colorful sea plants.",1464220800,,548,4.797872340425532
8758986,4,B01EK4V45G,"Enjoyable to have on in the background. The music is not intrusive, though I would have preferred it with sea sounds rather than music. The visuals are soothing, lots of interesting sea life here! However, they are NOT in open waters- they appear to be in an aquarium setting. Overall, if you're looking for a Jacques Cousteau-quality natural depiction of life under the sea, this isn't it. But, if you need something low-key, soothing and visually interesting enough to watch, but relaxed enough not to have to watch, it's a great balance! I wanted something to have on in the background while kids do homework, instead of the addictive and distracting TV- this works great, and I like it myself too. It would probably also be enjoyable for someone in a long term care setting, for example with mild to moderate dementia, or unable to get out much- as an adjunct to more lively videos (like anything with kittens!)",1501200000,,915,4.761006289308176

8758991,2,B01EK4V45G,"I don't want to be the bummer in all these 5 star reviews, because it IS a beautiful video (DVD). No complaints about the filming or the quality...but on a large screen projection, it's just TOO in your face. Meaning, there are a lot of Up-close shots of certain creatures, and I mean creatures, not fish, and when they are that big and that close, it looks like something under a microscope slide. Or little monsters. It looks like things from science class, or another planet maybe. Not even relaxing, Just makes you sit and stare, like OMG what is that?!

This might not have the same effect on a smaller screen. Might be just perfect! But on a BIG screen, no. Sorry.",1484092800,5,670,4.4471544715447155

8758993,5,B01EK4V45G,"To break down this DVD, there's basically 3 aquariums (Ocean 1, 2 & 3), and 2 specialty tracks (Coral Tranquility & Ocean Dreams). Any of the aquariums are great for subtle ambiance. What I mean by aquarium is that the camera is basically stationary and the wildlife comes and goes out of the frame. But it looks like it might have been filmed in the ocean as opposed to an actual aquarium, but I'm not sure. Very peaceful and soothing.

Now, the specialty tracks are absolutely fascinating. You'll see some of the most unique sea creatures you could possible imagine, including what appears to be some deeper water biofluorescence fish. Different varieties of sea horses (some look more like plant life than sea horses), weird and bazaar sea animals, coral gardens, clown fish interacting with moving and flowing sea anemone. There's even jellyfish that fill the screen which is truly amazing. Quite extraordinary. There's also some very cool panoramic vistas with the camera moving through coral reefs. The colors in many of the shots almost look like those florescent black light posters from the 70's. The high definition creates real sense of depth, especially on larger HD TVs.",1476316800,4,1183,4.974747474747475
8758994,5,B01EK4V45G,"As a long time scuba diver and water enthusiast, I really enjoyed this DVD. It is beautifully done with great color and nice relaxing music to accompany the fish in their underwater ballet. A great respite from the cable news shows and the frantic pace of so much on TV. It's like having a large, professionally done, aquarium in your home or a window underwater in the tropics. Thanks for a job well done!",1472342400,5,406,4.5
8758995,5,B01EK4V45G,"I own several titles from this series and this particular one (""Coral Tranquility"") may likely be my favorite release so far. The bright colors and tranquil underwater scenes are relaxing yet thoroughly engaging. There's also a choice of soundtracks as well - surf sound only, surf and soft new age piano and just piano. I like the surf sounds because I can listen to my own music at the same time. If you enjoy high quality, high definition underwater footage you really can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommended.",1470268800,2,521,4.8
