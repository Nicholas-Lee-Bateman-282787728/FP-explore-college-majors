8053466,1,B0007XLFCW,"While these movies and books appeal to contain good Christian moral values the fact of the matter is they are made to support the leaders of the cult formerly known as the Children of God, that changed their name to The Family International. Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves. All this information is well documented and easy to find with a quick google search",1457395200,,592,4.647619047619048
8053467,1,B0007XLFCW,"All money from these products goes to the Children of God cult, now known as the Family International. This cult was founded by David Berg, a known pedophile, and since his death has been run by his wife Karen Zerby, another pedophile. The Family has always been defined by its horrific child abuse and forced child labor, as myself and thousands of other survivors who were born into this group can attest to. Don't support cults or child abuse.  Do not buy these videos.",1457222400,,472,4.619047619047619

8053469,1,B0007XLFCW,"Do not buy this product you are supporting pedophiles. This product is made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerbys pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Burring, Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent. Here is a link on the practices and beliefs of the cult. [...]",1456704000,,753,4.792307692307692

We put them on all the time for her to watch when we have her with us. They teach great Biblical truths, they are great! I highly recommend these videos or dvd's. They come both ways! They are geared toward the very young. ""Train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it!""",1326672000,,434,4.178571428571429
