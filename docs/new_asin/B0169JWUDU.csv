7464449,4,B0169JWUDU,"Underdogs is a rarity- its a great animated feature film produced outside of the United States that looses nothing in translation, is tricky to find and has a generic name that makes it even trickier to identify.  All of that being said, overcome the obstacles and you're in for quite a charming film thats equal parts Toy Story, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Everyones Hero.

Beginning life as an Argentine theatrical film called Metegol and costing $21-million to make, this one was in theaters back in 2013 competing with big boys like Despicable Me 2 and Pixars Monsters University.  Surprisingly enough, not only does it bear the distinction of being the most expensive film ever made in Latin America, it took in $25.1-million at the box office, beating out the giants mentioned above in that region.

Films with that kind of notoriety rarely stay put and thus was the case for Metegol.  First it received an English dub and a new name (The Unbeatables) for the UK market.  Then it received another English vocal performance with different actors, another new name (The Underdogs) and brought over here to the United States.

Where things get tricky is that legal issues have kept the film from being released here on DVD from the Weinstein group as originally planned.  In June of 2016 it arrived to Netflix and at the time of this reviews writing, it is poised to be released on DVD officially to North America tomorrow (July 19th) after countless pushed-back release dates.

Finally, making this even crazier, the Underdogs just so happens to the name of yet another film that also came out in 2013; this one a live-action drama directed by Doug Dearth.

If you can make sense of all this- The Underdogs is a 97-minute long CG animated feature film written and directed by Juan Jos Campanella and tells the tale of a father named Jake narrating a story to his son, discouraged about not scoring a single goal in soccer all season, that winning isn't as important as giving it ones best.

His recollection includes a bit of a magical element that turns inanimate toys into a cast of nonstop hilarity.

At its core, the tale is a love story reminiscent to the dynamic witnessed in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs between lead character Jake and high school crush Laura.  The villain in this one, though, comes not from a machine that turns water in food but rather in the form of a soccer star named Ace; a lad so diluted, so pompous that he speaks with an English accent despite coming from Orlando.

Unable to accept defeat in any capacity, Ace comes back to his small hometown after making millions of dollars playing professional soccer with plans of leveling the place on account of the fact that Jake had beaten him in a game of Foosball years earlier at the cafe there.

While writing out the summary, it all sounds a little silly but in action its- well yeah, its pretty silly.  But the good news is that it works.  The narrative, the pacing, the humor, all top notch.

I have gone on record stating that taking a foreign film and slapping an English dub atop it is the formula for disaster in the CG animated film game more times than I care to recount and yet here, this may be the only time I can recall where it works.  And works it does!

How the individuals responsible managed to match up Spanish-speaking character mouth flaps for the English dub is truly anybodys guess.  But even more importantly than that- the natural timing of an English spoken conversation is perfectly in tact here as well.  The difficulty of this process is certainly not lost upon this critic and can be witnessed in literally hundreds of lesser projects littering the Redbox and Netflix streams as we speak.

All in all I came away from the piece absolutely astonished with the end-result.  Not that we Americans, spoiled as we are by the likes of Sony, Pixar and DreamWorks haven't seen better, I think a lot of the charm in this one stems from the fact that it manages to accomplish so much on so little.  That and this is truly one of the only projects Ive witnessed to date that manages to deliver so flawless a dub.  Until I dug into the press materials, I had literally no idea that this wasn't a project born, produced and animated around an English-speaking voice cast.

Heres hoping the official DVD release comes to pass this time.  Truly this underrated gem needs to adorn the shelves of any true fan of the CG animated film medium.",1468800000,6,4453,4.616751269035533
7464450,4,B0169JWUDU,I took a look on this one. Underdogs is quite a great fun movie to watch but it skip the theater for unknown reasons,1466208000,,116,3.875
7464451,5,B0169JWUDU,"Cartoon/Animated fan. That is me. But I am very picky when it comes to the 'toons I watch. The animation has to be good and the story has to be entertaining and the overall 'toon has to hold my attention. Jake is a foosball player in a small town. He challenges and defeats the town bully, Ace. Ace goes on to  become the worlds best soccer player. comes back and challenges jake to get a team and play him in Soccer. Now we come to the magical life of jake's foosball characters coming to life to help him and the town. Now I will tell you....I loved this so much. it had all the elements that anyone could want for a fun viewing for young and older alike. Sit bat and enjoy with the family.",1473897600,,692,4.125925925925926

7464468,5,B0169JWUDU,"Fantastic family movie that will be enjoyed by both kids and adults, and you don't have to love or know much about soccer to enjoy it. The characters are interesting and the writing is really clever.  Plus there's a great moral to the story (several, in fact).

The movie covers father-son relationships, bullying, teamwork, doing your best, facing fear, cheating, vanity, rivalry, and a host of other important topics, all in a fun, fast-paced, and witty hour and 45 minutes. Plus, it has foosball! What more could one want?

Really, this far exceeded my expectations and there is nothing inappropriate about it -- no bad words, sex, drugs, overly scary scenes, or slow, awkward content. It was a surprisingly enjoyable movie to watch with my 12 year old daughter (who hates sports!). We give it two enthusiastic thumbs up.",1470700800,4,824,4.913669064748201

8735997,5,B0169JWUDU,"Nothing beats watching this movie in it's original language. It's HILARIOUS! Granted, the English Dub does it best to get the essence of the movie, but trust me. It's so Much Better in Spanish!",1530057600,,193,4.705882352941177

8735999,5,B0169JWUDU,"Entertaining for all ages with clever references to classic movies for the grown ups, plus a thoughtful  message at the end. Does winning at any cost justify the means? A question many people are asking these days.",1484438400,,214,4.783783783783784

8736002,3,B0169JWUDU,This film was ok. The moral was good but the story was a tad boring. It really didn't hold my 6 year olds attention like other animated films typically do.,1475280000,,155,4.2
8736003,4,B0169JWUDU,"Great plot, kept me interested the whole movie. Whoever did the animation for this movie ought to win an award. I've never seen such realistic facial expressions in a cartoon that are just as effective as real life actors.

Only complaint:

Original movie wasn't in English, so this is fairly forgiving...
The words/lines of the characters didn't match with their mouths moving.",1475280000,2,378,5.080645161290323
8736004,5,B0169JWUDU,Great movie,1474675200,,11,5.0
8736005,2,B0169JWUDU,"This movie is not terrible, but definitely not ""above average"" as far as kids movies, or animated movies, go. I watched it based on the 4+ ratings in customer reviews at the time of purchase, and have been disappointed.

The plot is all over the place and doesn't take the time to build meaningful personalities for the main characters. The bond between the father and his son is completely ignored and just serves as an introduction to the movie (I spent a good amount of the movie expecting the plot to tie the story to the initial scenario), the Jake/Laura relationship is thin as paper, and so generally is the role of women in this movie; the bad guy is ridiculously stereotyped and even for a kid's movie it is just impossible to believe any of his motives; all secondary characters, in particular the ""townies"" (the soccer team representing the town), are people we're supposed to care about I guess, because we saw them for a total of 2 minutes in a bar at the beginning of the movie?

The first 2/3rd of the movie focuses on showing us that Jake loves his foosball team and his friend Laura, but the movie fails at showing both these things. When Jake's foosball table gets thrown into a dump and his girlfriend captured, he focuses on saving his foosball team first. Great priorities. Cue in surreal and bizarre scenes including toys coming to life for no other reason than ""your tears must be magic"", toys riding a rat, toys being bullied at a carnival (some scenes in here are borderline horror-movie style), and more random stuff that's neither funny nor helping the plot.
Ultimately, Jake decides to fetch Laura, but no time for the plot now so let's wrap this up in a quick 5 minutes action sequence in which we learn that the bad guy also has a secret lab where he does genetics experiments. I swear this scene has been cut so badly there are times where if you blink you don't realize something has happened. Don't worry, the only goal of that place is to provide justification for a massive explosion.

By the time you reach 2/3rd of the movie, you've seen a 3 minutes foosball scene, and a bunch of nonsense. There's too much happening at once, too many characters we don't care about, and I'm wondering if any young kid can follow what's going on. My 5 year old asked me how lnog the movie was, roughly 45 minutes into the movie. For a movie named ""underdogs"", with a soccer ball and two players on a field on the main cover art, I was surely expecting much more soccer (or foosball) scenes than that.

Finally, the last third of the movie leads to a soccer match. Pretty much nothing's at stake: people play the game to protect their city, but the stadium in which they play is the thing they were fighting against in the first place. At that point we're supposed to care for the ""underdogs"" team, but as I mentioned above they all are characters who were basically absent for the rest of the movie. Once the game begins, my son asked me ""why is this only guys?"". And that's a fair question. There's only one woman in the team and they name her ""Bob"" (to avoid any risk of the referee finding out she's a girl?). I realize soccer has some rules and mixed teams are not a thing, but neither is a team with a hobo, a priest, a thief and a cop. So why not put girls in the mix at that point?

Anyway, the final soccer game is great to watch and I wish there had been more of that throughout the movie, but as I mentioned by this time we don't really care about the characters or their goals. It's also completely unrealistic that these misfits have any chance (even with the massive cheating help they get from the foosball players) at winning against professional players, and the fact that all of a sudden they get super synchronized while the pros get angry and confused, is just way over the top, and I'm not even sure it sends a great message to kids (""don't prepare at all, and you still have a chance to win because you're the good guys?""). Yes, there is a message about cheating here, but it happens so quickly that kids will not all grasp it.

What else? The humor is hit and miss, very few scenes made my 5 year old laugh, and for grown ups, let's just say that there's a bunch of sexually-charged jokes that will make you feel uncomfortable at best. Did I mention the racial stereotypes? You'll love the Italian brothers and the asian dude.
The role of women in this movie is taking us back to the 70's, Laura is a dumb love-interest and nothing more. Her contribution to the last third is to sit in the stadium as a supporter and kiss the hero once he ""wins"".

At the end of the movie, we're back to Jake and his son, who discovers that Jake's foosball players are indeed real. I think it's a message about how magical foosball can be, from my generation to the younger folks who only play video games nowadays. But even though I was born and raised in a foosball/soccer loving country, this whole message just failed to reach me until I researched a bit more about the movie online. I don't see how kids, or anyone who's not been brought up in Europe/South America would even start to get that message.

There are lots of animated movies out there. Why waste your time on a sub par one.",1474156800,,5217,4.404564315352697
