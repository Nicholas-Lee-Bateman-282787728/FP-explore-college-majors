8439415,4,B004RZE2QC,"It's an historic film produced in the sixties showing photographs, official documents, and newspaper clippings of German UFO's developed from WW2.  German propaganda teams likely crafted still photographs of UFO's to match George Adamski's photographs of real UFO's.  Perhaps the  Germans added NAZI symbols and gun turrets underneath to scare its enemies during WW2.  Germans may had developed unarmed and unmanned Foo Fighters which had mysterious flight characteristics.  Due to the number of UFO sightings, the film ponders whether of not earth is being used as a manufacturing base of deadly toys to be delivered to some distant intergalactic war game.",1403568000,,657,5.465346534653466
