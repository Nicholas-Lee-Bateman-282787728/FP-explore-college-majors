8458443,3,B0055KOJG6,"A beautiful woman marries a doctor and finds that the doctor loves his profession more than he loves her. His absence feeds her loneliness and desire for romance. This film features imaginative, elaborate Chinese costuming and pageantry. Its a slow moving romance, but Garbos screen presence is so strong, that alone carries the movie. Mildly interesting but a must for Garbo fans.",1496275200,,381,5.161290322580645
