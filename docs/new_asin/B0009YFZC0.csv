8070450,5,B0009YFZC0,"1952 film where Loretta Young royally entertains her fans. She is a Queen of Holllywood. A woman's picture as they used to refer to them,but it is superb ! After a woman leaves prison to stsrt her new life she lies by omission and leads herself into a life of great misery. A soap opera yes but made into much more with her great leading man Jeff Chandler.",1358726400,4,356,4.25
8070451,1,B0009YFZC0,"I too saw this movie years, years ago. Loved it however, they're asking waaaaay too much. Too bad. No sale here. I gave it one star for the price. I give it 5 stars for the movie.",1333584000,10,179,3.864864864864865
8070452,5,B0009YFZC0,This is one of the best for old time movies.  I have been waiting for TCM to put it on...to no avail.  I would love to buy it but $80 is a little steep.....sigh.,1288656000,6,161,3.7058823529411766
8070453,4,B0009YFZC0,I saw this movie about 20 years ago.  I couldn't sleep one night and woke up and it was on. I can't believe I fell asleep before it was over. I've been trying to find this movie every since then but up until last year I didn't even know the name of it.  I would love to see it but I don't want to pay $38.  Hopefully one day Turner Classic Movies will show it and I will finally see the ending.,1269820800,9,394,3.7804878048780486
