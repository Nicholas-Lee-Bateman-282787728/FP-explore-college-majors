3753041,5,B001PO54V0,"A great space-saving alternative for those whose DVD collections are getting slightly out of hand, or an ideal gift for that special someone you know who just can't get enough classic movies!  This set focuses on four of the greatest MGM musicals.

SINGIN' IN THE RAIN:  Arguably regarded as the greatest musical ever made, this breezy delight stars Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds in a story about the pandemonium that ensued when the ""Talkies"" first took over Hollywood.  Special Features: audio commentary hosted by Debbie Reynolds, and the trailer.

EASTER PARADE: Fred Astaire came out of retirement to star opposite Judy Garland in this all-time easter favourite built around the Irving Berlin song catalogue.  Ann Miller steals the whole show with her energetic ""Shakin' the Blues Away""--which she performed while still nursing a broken back!  Special Features: audio commentary by Ava Astaire McKenzie and John Fricke, and a Judy Garland trailer gallery.

THE BAND WAGON:  Get aboard with Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse for the rollicking story of the creation of a new Broadway musical!  Special Features: audio commentary by Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein, and a Fred Astaire trailer gallery.

MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS:  Judy Garland was never more appealing than when she played lovestruck Esther Smith in this nostalgic turn-of-the-century delight, which also boasts a winning performance from young Margaret O'Brien.  Special Features:  all-new introduction from Liza Minnelli, audio commentary by John Fricke, and a Vincente Minnelli trailer gallery.",1245628800,24,1563,5.404958677685951

3753043,4,B001PO54V0,"Hadn't seen bandwagon, or easter parade, but I love Meet me in St. Louis, and singing in the rain. Really loved Easter Parade, but HATED Bandwagon. But the rest of the musicals are wonderful. It would have been better with Carousel instead of bandwagon. But great price for 3 clasics.",1245110400,5,284,4.7
3753044,5,B001PO54V0,"Turner Classic Movies is manna for movie lovers.  Boasting a massive library of M-G-M, Warner Brothers, R-K-O, Paramount, and independent features, the cable station runs its films uncut and commercial free.  A  series of DVD's in the TCM Greatest Classic Films Series from Warner Home Video packages four features in each of six releases devoted to specific genres.

The best of these by far is ""American Musicals,"" a real treasure containing  ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" ""Easter Parade,""  and ""The Band Wagon.""  These tuneful Technicolor song-and-dance fests rank among Hollywood's very best musicals, featuring three of the genre's greatest stars.  Gene Kelly heads the cast of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" which regularly tops critics' Best Musicals of All Time lists.  Judy Garland stars in the period pieces ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" and ""Easter Parade.""  Fred Astaire headlines ""The Band Wagon"" and ""Easter Parade,"" behind-the-scenes show biz tales with great scores and witty screenplays that draw upon conflict with his leading ladies.

In ""The Band Wagon,"" Astaire is Tony Hunter, a fading Broadway star talked into working with ballet dancer Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse) in a Broadway play directed by an Orson Welles-inspired Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan).  Betty Comden and Adolph Green's screenplay milks laughs from the oil-and-water blend of Hunter's hoofer and Gabrielle's classic styles and the grandiose intellectuality of the director's approach to a bright and bubbly musical.  Director Vincente Minnelli creates memorable musical numbers, especially ""A Shine on Your Shoes,"" which takes place in a Times Square amusement arcade, and ""Dancing in the Dark,"" a lyrical number performed in Central Park as Tony and Gabrielle discover that they can dance together when the mood is right.

""Easter Parade"" finds Astaire's Don Hewes abandoned by his longtime dance partner (Ann Miller), who is setting out on a solo career.  Vowing to pick someone from anonymity and mold her into a new dance sensation, Don plucks Hannah Brown (Judy Garland) from a line of chorus girls and starts his rigorous transformation.  The Irving Berlin score is thrilling, and includes the amazing Astaire solo ""Steppin' Out With My Baby,"" Miller's knock-em-dead rendition of ""Shaking the Blues Away,"" and ""A Couple of Swells,"" with Astaire and Garland as hobos with a Terpsichorean flair.

""Meet Me in St. Louis"" contains the Garland standards ""The Trolley Song,"" ""The Boy Next Door,"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"" but also the beautiful, lesser known ""Over the Bannister,"" ""Under the Bamboo Tree"" (a sublime duet with Margaret O'Brien) and ""Skip to My Lou.""  The Halloween sequence is a stand-out, as little Tootie volunteers to go up to the creepiest house in the neighborhood and ""kill"" its owner with flour.

""Singin' in the Rain"" is simply glorious.  Kelly performs his signature title number, of course, but also hits the bull's eye with ""Good Morning,"" performed with Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds.  Watch young Reynolds in this number.  She's dancing with two of the best veteran dancers in film, holds her own and looks as if she's been hoofing her whole life.  The O'Connor solo ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is quite simply the funniest musical number ever put on film.  The film's Comden & Green screenplay lampoons the period in Hollywood when sound suddenly made silent pictures obsolete and threw the industry in a tizzy as it had to learn how to make ""talkies.""  Jean Hagen, as silent star Lina Lamont, is hysterical.

I love all four of these musicals, and was amazed to see them available in a single set.  If your budget is limited and you want to collect vintage musicals, this M-G-M quartet will provide you with unparalleled entertainment.  Even with repeat viewings, you'll never get tired of seeing Astaire, Kelly, and Garland doing what they did best.",1243209600,3,3893,5.156050955414012
3753045,4,B001PO54V0,I wonder why they put these movies out in full screen format. All the new televisions are wide screen. With these movies being released in May you would think it would be manufactured for the new sets.,1239235200,8,201,4.45945945945946
3753046,5,B001PO54V0,"This is one of several DVD sets that TCM/WHV is producing over the next year or so that brings the classic films to the masses at affordable prices. All of these films are available in more deluxe editions, so this is mainly for those who are not interested in extra features. Every one of these is a five star film for musical lovers.

Singin in the Rain is my favorite movie musical and perhaps the best movie musical ever made. Thrown together quickly after the success of ""An American in Paris"" I love it for its comedy, its timing, and its wonderful plag iarism of just about every song written for MGM movies between 1929 and 1940. If you are interested in extras this film is available as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00006DEF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. The two disc edition has some wonderful extras about the transition from silent film to sound.

The Band Wagon is one of Fred Astaire's best MGM musicals. Fred plays an aging song and dance man whose friends are writing a new Broadway show and want Fred to star. They enlist a Broadway headliner to help them get financial backing, but the show the veteran describes is a musical version of Faust, not the fun romp that was originally planned. This one is available in a more deluxe version as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Band-Wagon-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007YXPKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Band Wagon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

The Easter Parade stars Fred Astaire again. After being rejected by his girlfriend/star, on a lark he offers Judy Garland a job as his partner, claiming he could make her as big a star as his ex-girlfriend. The next day he regrets his offer, but he has to go through with it when Judy shows up for rehearsal after having already quit her current job. Again, if you like extra features it is available as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easter-Parade-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007939MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easter Parade (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

Meet Me in St. Louis stars Judy Garland and is about - absolutely nothing. However, this musical which has no big events and no real dramatic climax will grow on you. It is about a year in the life of an extended St. Louis family. The father has accepted a job offer in New York City, and nobody in the family is happy about it. This midwestern group does not want to give up their easy-going way of life and all of their friends for the big treeless city. Worse yet, the move is scheduled to take place at Christmas. This is available in the deluxe&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-Me-In-St-Louis-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKGZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet Me In St. Louis (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. The best thing about this 2-disc edition is the inclusion of the 1930 Vitaphone short ""Bubbles"". Besides being one of the strangest little musical shorts ever, it stars Judy Garland back when she was still one of the Gumm Sisters.",1234051200,58,3206,5.786016949152542

3753157,5,B001PO54V0,"This is a wonderful collection.  We are lucky that both Gene Kelly's  and Fred Astaire's  dancing was captured on film during the ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood musicals.  It gives all of us a chance to see the creativity,  genius, and just plain hard work  that went into their performances. .  Plus they had the best composers and lyricists of the 20th Century creating the songs -- in many cases just for Fred and Gene.  So, go, buy the collection. sit back and enjoy it.  Again and again and again

I don't mean to slight ""Meet Me in St Louis"" but that is not a dancing movie.  It's more a singing movie with the incomparable Judy Garland..  It is just as enjoyable as the Gene and Fred movies.  Great storyline.  Marvelous songs.  Superb acting.",1503273600,,745,4.496240601503759

3753388,5,B001PO54V0,"I bought this just to have Singing in the Rain and Meet Me In St. Louis, and those two movies, alone, were worth the purchase. I am not a fan of musicals, normally, for the following reasons: 1. I don't understand why people need to publicly break into song about random things that could be much easier stated, 2. I hate that one irrelevant scene in every musical that does nothing to further the plot and only exists, it seems, because the songwriter had an extra song lying around that needed to be unloaded on an unsuspecting musical, and 3. I feel empathetically awkward and embarrassed for a performer after he or she has finished a spontaneous performance, into which he or she poured heart and soul, and no one in the scene knows how to react to such a socially awkward display, so they have to fade out to avoid acknowledgement (I mean, imagine if a co-worker suddenly burst into a spontaneous musical number on the board room table in the middle of a meeting, strategically throwing papers and using your rolling chairs as part of his or her choreography. You wouldn't feel embarrassed enough to want a fade-out?). Anyway, despite my general disdain for musicals, I really enjoy both Singing in the Rain and Meet Me in St. Louis. Their great plot lines make up for any sense of awkwardness. Moreover, Singing in the Rain is hilarious and Meet Me in St. Louis gives St. Louis a shout-out! Watching these movies, I almost feel like every song is worthwhile and couldn't have been said more simply with a statement... Almost...",1414972800,,1534,4.643382352941177

3753460,4,B001PO54V0,"TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES has made a boxed set of four of my favorite MGM musicals.

""MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS"" falls into a very unique favorite.  This 1944 classic, directed by Vincente Minnelli features Judy Garland in top billing as Esther Smith a member of a typical American Midwest family in 1904. All of them eagerly await the opening of the World Exposition in 1904. It is wonderful entertainment in which Judy sings ""The Boy Next Door"", The Trolley Song"", and ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"".  A wonderful supporting cast that include Mary Astor, Leon Ames, Tom Drake, Marjorie Main and last but not least, the adorable Margaret O'Brien playing Judy's youngest baby sister.  Each scene is like a Currier and Ives image which nostalgically recaptures those ""good old days"" times.

""SINGIN' IN THE RAIN"" has often been considered the best musical that ever came out of Hollywood.  Produced in 1952, it starred Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor.  Its featured songs are not original, as many were composed as far back as the 1920's, just as the Hollywood film industry was adapting to the ""talkies"".  Adding to its high texture of entertainment is the appearance of Jean Hagen as the vain ""Lena Lamont"" who bullies the studio head to stick to his contract with her.  There are a multitude of songs, too numerous to mention, except that the movie's trade mark is Gene Kelly getting wet while ""Singin' In The Rain"".

 ""EASTER PARADE"", released in 1949 and is well adorned with the music of Irving Berlin.  It starred Judy Garland and Fred Astaire.  A supporting cast that included Ann Miller and Peter Lawford, helped to make this musical an all time endearment.  There's a myriad of Berlin's nostalgic songs to enjoy, but I think the one that I personally like was ""We're a Couple of Swells"" sung by Astaire and Garland during a vaudeville sketch.

""THE BANDWAGON"" was released in 1953.  It starred Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse along with Oscar Levant.  The long list of songs was originally composed by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz.  Some of the songs were originally written for a 1931 Broadway musical of the same name.  One of the songs that stands out in my memory of this film, was a song which perfectly describes the movie, which is ""That's Entertainment"".",1373500800,6,2290,4.825641025641025
3753461,5,B001PO54V0,"I am a firm believer that the actors/actresses of today will never have the talent of those from this time.  They can truly sing, dance, and act.  Today all you really need to know is how to shot at someone or something, use bad language or take your clothes off.  Anyone can do that.",1367539200,,284,4.222222222222222

They bring back memories of a more gentle time.",1300060800,,135,4.625
3753512,5,B001PO54V0,"I ordered this DVD because it had all four of my favorite films. I did not have a copy of any of them so it was a plus getting them in one package. I must admit my favorite one is Singing in the Rain, but Easter Parade and Meet me in St. Louis run a very close second. It completes my collection of must have musicals like Rogers and Hammerstein Collection and now these four.",1298073600,,376,4.026666666666666
3753513,3,B001PO54V0,"This Four Pack DVD collection has two of the best musicals:  Singing In The Rain and Meet Me In St. Louis.  They are great.  The other two, with Fred Astaire, are bad.  The Band Wagon was especially terrible and boring.",1297555200,,219,4.4
3753514,5,B001PO54V0,"WE LOVED WATCHING THESE FOUR OLD MUSICALS.  THEY DON'T MAKE-UM LIKE THEY USED TA!  TWO DISCS WITH RECORDING ON BOTH SIDES.  WORKS FINE, QUALITY GREAT.  I CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE THESE WITH MY 84 YEAR OLD MOM!",1296950400,,204,4.4324324324324325
3753515,5,B001PO54V0,"If for some reason you never updated your video-to-DVD collection, this is a must with four pristine copies of some of the best MGM had to offer.
""Meet Me In St. Louis"" is the sentimental favorite with a grown-up Judy Garland dazzling the screen in her first non-teen role, and then you get her again with ""Easter Parade"" working with Fred Astaire, a replacement for the laid-up Gene Kelly.  We also get Astaire with an almost autobiographical history of his own life in ""The Band Wagon.""  Kelly is honored with one of his best ""Singing In The Rain,"" a very silly musical which made moviegoers think back about how things were in the days when sound became a staple.
This current series by WB is designed to be purchased by those who no longer could afford to buy the $50-70 sets that WB used to put out.  So enjoy while WB has them, and get alot of them.  They won't last too long.",1295740800,,882,4.392638036809816
3753516,5,B001PO54V0,"I love old musicals. These are some of the best on one DVD. The song and dance numbers are great. I originally bought this because I was replacing our VHS version of ""Singing In The Rain"". When I saw all of the others listed on this DVD I was thrilled. Definitely worth it.",1295308800,,273,4.169811320754717
3753527,1,B001PO54V0,I received this item as a gift and got 2 disc 1's so I am missing Singin' in the Rain which I was looking forward to watching today!  Ugh not gonna be fun trying to exchange a gift!,1295136000,6,181,3.763157894736842
3753528,5,B001PO54V0,Love all of the movies. It takes me back to when I was a kid and on Sundays and they would play them on TV.. Great Rainy day or sick day movies.. Like a big Ol' bowl of chicken soup.. Comforting... :),1294963200,,200,3.7857142857142856
3753529,2,B001PO54V0,Bought this item for my grandson for Christmas. When he finally opened it the 2 discs inside were the same. Meet Me in St Louis/Easter Parade. Disc with The Band Wagon/Singin' in the Rain was not there.,1294444800,2,202,4.486486486486487
3753530,5,B001PO54V0,"I bought this video for my mom. She has Alzheimer's but still enjoys musicals. These are classics and are fun to watch. We especially like Singing in the Rain. The dancing in the rain scene is the most famous, but the film is actually quite good with plot and acting. Definitely a good buy if you want to enjoy top-notch musicals.",1294012800,,330,4.426229508196721
3753531,1,B001PO54V0,"Two of the same dvds were included, instead of two different dvds totaling 4 movies. Now I need to contact and return this item if possible.

The quality of the dvds themselves isn't bad, but I didn't get what I paid for.",1293408000,5,221,4.261904761904762
3753532,5,B001PO54V0,"Four of the GREAT old movies, when actors and actresses could actually act, and the music was cheerful and not monotone and had more lyrics than five word being repeated over and over as they do now.....Movies ought to go back to this instead of teh garbage Hollywood produces now days.",1293235200,,286,4.627450980392157
3753533,1,B001PO54V0,"I bought this product mainly for ""Meet Me in St. Louis"".  When I tried to play the DVD on my PC, I couldn't find it.  In fact, I could only view ""Singin' in the Rain/Eater Parade"".  There were no labels on the DVD, making it harder to identify which movie was where.  I tried on a regular DVD player and found ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", but it did not have audio and each scene froze one after another.  So, I got to see 5 scenes.  It's been a very frustrated experience.  I definitely would not recommend this product.",1289692800,11,516,4.151515151515151
3753534,4,B001PO54V0,"These are well set up and good transfers.  They contain disc 1 of each title's 2 disc release.  The price is great, making it the perfect placeholder to replace my laserdiscs while I wait for the eventual BluRay release.

My only nit is that the 4 movies come on 2 discs.  Since they are 2 sided discs, the printing is small, making it impossible to read in low light conditions.  Given that these probably appeal to an older audience, the buyer may find it difficult to select the correct movie.",1284508800,5,496,4.466666666666667

3753536,5,B001PO54V0,"This collection of 4 of the best musicals is truly a treasure and a terrific bargain.  The movies are the full versions of the original movies, not shortened or otherwise downgraded.  The video and audio quality are both great.  For anyone who likes musicals (even just a little bit), this is a great deal.",1284249600,,306,4.62962962962963
3753547,4,B001PO54V0,"Though I'm not much of a musicals fan, I loved each of these classics even though the plot lines are not terribly exciting, or nearly non-existent in the case of Meet Me in St. Louis.  As 3 of the 4 movies are about performers, the music was not just people breaking into song in awkward places.  The 4th, St. Louis, the music also seemed natural in the family setting. I found myself enjoying the characters.
They are wholesome films, and in my opinion, entertaining, and relaxing.
If you're looking for excitement or adventure in your movie or a complex plot, these may not be for you.

The only drawback for me was packaging, the 2 - 2 sided disks. I fear scratching the top side, thus one of the movies, as I deal with the disk.",1282608000,11,732,4.367647058823529
3753548,5,B001PO54V0,This is an outstanding collection of Hollywood musicals at an outstanding price.  TCM is to be applauded for releasing multiple films with one purchase.  We own these musicals on VHS but jumped at the chance to purchase these.,1277942400,,226,4.921052631578948
3753549,5,B001PO54V0,"Purchased this for my Grandfather, who recently upgraded from a VCR to a newfangled DVD player.  His favorite movie of all time is 'Singin' in the Rain', and with this purchase, you get 4 for the price of 1!!!! He says he can watch 'Singin in the Rain' over and over again and he never gets sick of it-- this is the first time he's ever had the opportunity to watch the commentary & behind the scenes extras, and he LOVES it.  The other movies ('The Band Wagon', 'Meet me in St. Louis' & 'Easter Parade') are also excellent.  TCM did a great job of pairing these films together. Its also nice that the 3 generations can all sit down and enjoy these films together.  When I was a kid in the 80's, I saw part of 'Meet Me in St. Louis' on television, and wanted to watch the rest of it.  We couldn't find it ANYWHERE. TCM is putting out lots of these 'classic collections' on DVDs, which will make it easy to build a whole library for my grandparents, parents and my children (one day...) to enjoy!!!",1274140800,2,997,4.253968253968254
