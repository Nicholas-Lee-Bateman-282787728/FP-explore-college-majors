8041962,1,B0006OBPZ4,This is not the story of johnny appleseed but a farce. It is meant to be funny but it's not. Not at all accurate.ry,1402272000,,115,3.8333333333333335
8041963,5,B0006OBPZ4,"We loved this series when it first came out.  The Johnny Appleseed with Martin Short is our favorite, and is a keeper.",1369526400,,118,4.363636363636363

8041965,1,B0006OBPZ4,"I purchased this video for my daughter to use in her first grade class.  This was way over their heads.  This needs to be rated for upper elementary grades who I am not sure actually study Johnny Appleseed.  I will probably donate it to the school or sell it, what a disappointment.",1224806400,4,282,4.384615384615385
8041966,1,B0006OBPZ4,"The product description  of ""classic American folk tale"" might lead one to believe that this movie is the legend of Johnny Appleseed, when in fact, it is not based on the legend nor on the factual life of Johnny Chapman.  It is instead, a farcical adaptation that, even with the great talents of Martin Short and Rob Reiner, falls short of funny.  I was hoping for something entertaining and educational for my young grandchildren, but this film was neither.  I ordered Walt Disney's MELODY TIME at the same time and can recommend its short classic, LEGEND OF JOHNNY APPLESEED.",1212451200,7,577,4.797979797979798
8041967,4,B0006OBPZ4,"Tall Tales and Legends is by Fairie Tale Theatre's Shelley Duvall.  They take all of the old fables told to you when you were young, and bring them to life, with lots of 80's movie stars.
Johnny Appleseed stars Martin Short as the title character, who goes around planting America's apple orchards.  Its got a good message,  that even someone weird shouldn't be shunned, they could actually help you out!  It also has Rob Reiner, Molly Ringwald and Michael McKean.
The bad thing I find with the Tall Tales series is the sound... I don't watch it in the media room with the sound system, I find it works better in the den on my plain old TV.  There's alot of background noise that can get distracting.  So no the sound and picture aren't perfect,  but these are low-price family videos, so over-all they are a good deal!",1121040000,7,819,4.493243243243243
8041968,2,B0006OBPZ4,"If you're looking for the Johnny Appleseed cartoon that you saw in the 1970's or 1980's, this is not it.  In the old story, he walked all over the country starting orchards and singing, ""The Lord is Good to Me.""  There was lots of color.  In this story the colors are blue and brown, and he stays in a little town trying to convince everyone the virtues of apples & juice. No singing.  I am disappointed.",1108598400,,404,4.276315789473684
