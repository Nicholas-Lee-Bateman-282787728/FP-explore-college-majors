1648188,3,B00005QFEB,"Rather lengthy scenarios on why U.S.went to war during WWII.  Demonizing Japanese and Germans involved.  Actual accounts of some key battles is good.  Overall, a good but not spectacular collection of important conflicts in Europe and the Pacific.",1182902400,4,247,5.447368421052632
1648189,4,B00005QFEB,"This is an excellent overview of the Marines and Navy in the South Pacific during WWII.  For those of you looking for an overview or detailed account of the Army during WWII in the South Pacific, look elsewhere, because you will find next to nothing about the Army in ""Fury in the Pacific"".  If one didn't know differently, after watching this DVD set one might think that the Army had no involvement at all in the South Pacific.

For anyone wanting to broaden their knowledge of the South Pacific beyond the Marines and the Navy, a good book to start with is the ""25th Infantry Division: WWII"" originally published in 1946 and reprinted by the Battery Press Inc. in 1996.  If it's not available on Amazon, it can definitely be found elsewhere on the internet.  I also HIGHLY recommend ""Across the Dark Islands: The War in the Pacific"" by Floyd W. Radike.  It is an excellent first person account of what the Army infantry contributed and experienced in the South Pacific.  It is available on Amazon and elsewhere.

Despite being disappointed by the tunnel vision of this set, I would still recommend it as a ""must have"" in any WWII video collection.  The first section, focusing on Pearl Harbor, is excellent and very informative.  The interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors are truthful, engaging and heartbreaking.  The black and white and color footage throughout the series is great and the entire set includes interviews with Marine and Navy veterans from every battle mentioned.",1170288000,6,1485,4.853174603174603
1648190,5,B00005QFEB,"This is a three DVD set that is fantastic. We get to see firsthand the great battles fought during World War II across the vast Pacific Ocean. This shows us some of what occured during this war through the lenses of combat cameramen. And told by those who were there and experience the events depicted.
It begins with the suprise attack at Pearl Harbor, to the initial USA counterattack at Guadalcanal, to ultimate victory in the island hopping campaign. If you want some idea of what transpired in the Pacific during World War II....You will want to get this DVD set.",1085097600,12,568,4.633663366336633
7950398,3,B00005QFEB,"I own a lot of documentaries on WW2.  I bought this one even though it had no reviews because it was cheap.  The description does not detail what is contained in the package. It is actually a subset re-package of the ""WWII Battlefront"" series which I already own.  I wish the contents of all the episodes would be listed so that we wouldn't be tricked into buying the same episodes in different collections.

This DVD package contains:

Disc 1
 The Fall of Singapore
 Pearl Harbor
 The Battle of Midway
 The Solomon Islands

Disc 2
 Side A
  The Gilbert Islands
  Burma: The Forgotten Front
  Battle in Palau
  Liberation of the Phillipines
 Side B
  Operation Dragoon
  Battle of the Bulge
  The Last Stronghold
  Mount Hot Rocks

As other have noted in other reviews of the other packages, these are colorized, not actual color film footage.  But I enjoy them anyway.

You'll find these same episodes in a number of other packaged sets.  Just search for ""Great Battles WWII"" or ""WWII Battlefront"" and compare the contents.

I believe the one has the complete ""Battlefront"" set, but it may not be the only one that is complete:

It's a good series, but I don't need to keep buying it over and over again.",1363219200,3,1358,5.304761904761905
7950399,5,B00005QFEB,"The combat footage on these dvds are excellent, they give you ah good feel for the battle.  The commentary is good but not always necesary to the viewing of the dvds.  I wish they were all in color, biut they are still very good.  There is no substitute for the actual footage.  I would definitely recommend this dvd to any fan of ww11.  JRV",1361577600,,341,4.265625
7950400,5,B00005QFEB,"I recommend this DVD to all World War II buffs or a teacher that is
teaching the subject of the actions in the Europe Theater, although
one part deals with the Battle of Manila in the Pacific, most is about
the war in Europe.
Generals speak of their actions and tell of the Why,When and Were.
I taught history before I retired and would have loved to have had
this DVD from TIMELESS MEDIA GROUP to show the students.",1339200000,,416,4.2784810126582276
7950401,4,B00005QFEB,"These DVDs are a must of WW II buffs.  I am very pleased with
this buy.  I bought them in the used category and they came
new.  The quality is of the 1940s time frame and are not real sharp
but considering that time and the camera work I deem it good.
You will not go wrong if you buy this series from the used
category.",1337126400,,320,3.8181818181818183
7950402,3,B00005QFEB,"This is a collection of five WWII documentaries on two discs. The shows are:

Great Battle on the Volga 1hr15

60's russian propaganda about the Battle of Stalingrad. The transfer has some dust and skips badly towards the end. Not a bad video though.

True Glory 1hr20

Western Allies propaganda to offset the Russian one. Brief narration with war footage and stitched together with recalections from soldiers and civilians about the war. Covers from before D-Day to the end of the European war. Pretty good.

Battle of Britain 52min

Part of the seven part Why We Fight series. Some bad skips. Shows you what it was like to be a pilot or civilian during the Battle of Britain. Good enough.

Battle of China 1hr03

Another part of the Why We Fight series. Very comprehensive, it's the only show I know of that tells the whole story of China in WWII. Pretty good.

Battle for San Pietro 38min

Lots of death in this one. It seems to be the main theme. I think they went a bit overboard with the gruesomeness. Not that war isn't a nasty business but I think showing too much of it shows poor taste. This video shows poor taste. But it's short and if you are interested in the battle, this video gives it its full attention. It might be part of a series about various battles of WWII. I don't know.

Not bad videos. The video quality is pretty good. I'm not sure it's worth $10 but I paid it and don't feel ripped off.",1324339200,,1415,4.403846153846154
7950403,2,B00005QFEB,"I am a history buff. I was disappointed in these. Same old archival footage that you have seen a hundred times before, and not any new insight on the battles. Boring. My advice is don't waste your money. If you know nothing of history, you might find them useful for understanding a history class, but very little here.",1316563200,,319,4.517241379310345
7950404,4,B00005QFEB,"It's a three DVD set with not a lot of extras but the documentaries themselves are well done (and in color) that features a series of episodes on the major battles of WWII as well as some of the less covered topics (like the Battle of Singapore).

On a scale of things, it isn't at the level of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-A-Film-By-Ken-Burns-and-Lynn-Novick/dp/B000R7NBMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War - A Film By Ken Burns and Lynn Novick</a>&nbsp;but at the same time, it is a lot better than some of the other WWII DVDs that are out there that only feature a superficial look at the topic and the same tired footage.",1276992000,4,680,5.476190476190476
7950405,4,B00005QFEB,"I have been trying to find a DVD collection that covers the Pacific battles aspect of WWII and this video pretty much covers it in detail.  I was not disappointed and neither will other viewers be who want to learn about America's final victory and remember those thousands of brave heroes who lost their lives as well as those who survived.  Pro's and cons of video:

pros:  Film footage is of good quality, material is presented very well in chronological order and does not jump around from battle to battle like some others I have seen, the interviewed veterens tell the stories the best and you can really get a feel of what being in their shoes must have been like.

cons:  The narrator speaks in a slow and dronning voice that is muffled and might make you drowsy.  The sound quality of the interviewees is muffled and not equalized - some speakers you can barely hear and some are blarring loud so must continuously adjust he volume.  The old fashion 50's style background music adds to the dullness of the narrator.

All in all I recommend this to anyone interested in learning of the Pacific battles we have fought and won and want to in a small way pay tribute to those brave sailors and marines we have lost.",1267228800,,1220,4.509090909090909
7950406,1,B00005QFEB,"I watched this dvd set, then threw it in the trash.  I love virtually any World War 2 documentary, but these are not true documentaries.  They are old rehashed propoganda films made by the now defunct War Department.  Historically inaccurate, and boring too.  Even for Mill Creek, this is a new low in false advertising.",1209081600,5,320,4.763636363636364
7950407,4,B00005QFEB,"Good narrative and good use of archival film.  Honest presentation of the actions of Germany and Japan, resulting carnage, and key strategic decisions by military leaders.  Not suitable for children due to violence.",1195516800,5,215,5.484848484848484
