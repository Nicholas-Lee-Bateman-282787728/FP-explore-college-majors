6422142,5,B00KDPM88O,"These DVDs of the entire shows of Johnny Carson just get better and better. I have purchased all of the ""Vault Series"" so far and this one is the best yet. Not only have the producers been listening to the fans of these DVDs and have included many of the things that were missing, like more of the original Tonight Show Band music and the full introduction of Ed McMahon at the beginning of the show, but the idea to put a week's shows as they occurred each evening lent a sense of continuity and seamless feeling of flowing from one evening to another like it was happening right now. I loved that and hope they will continue this type of thoughtful production into the future.

If you are a fan of the Johnny Carson show and have fond memories of many years of watching this wonderful program you will not want to miss any of these DVDs. If you are of an age where you were around when Johnny was at the peak of his powers, why not check these productions out and see and experience the one who really started it all and that all have copied since and that none have come close to doing what Johnny did, but these DVDs do give us a glimpse and taste of those wonderful years.",1405296000,9,1177,4.231111111111111

6422144,5,B00KDPM88O,"I just purchased the complete set from the Johnny Carson Vault Series (Volumes 1 through 6), however this review is for Volume 6 only. Let me start off by saying that I knew it was going to be great, however it truly far exceeded even my highest expectations. I watched Volume 6 last night and I'm still shaking my head with amazement. First, the Quality.

QUALITY - I honestly have to say that the Quality of Volume 6 was truly my biggest surprise.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would truly give the picture quality of Volume 6 a true 8.5 to 9.  For something that was recorded over 40 years ago and then transferred to DVD, it is honestly almost as good as watching a High Definition DVD. It's absolutely outstanding and I was amazed.  The sound quality is great too. The were only a couple of very minor imperfections from the original tape recording, however, if you blinked at the just right time you'd probably miss them.

CONTENT - First, I really have to hand it to Johnny Carson. Show #2 on the DVD was taped during the 11th Anniversary Show on October 2, 1973. During the opening monologue, nearly every joke that Johnny told, totally bombed. You could easily tell that Johnny was taken by surprise because of the lack of laughter from the audience.  However again as usual, he eventually tells that one great joke that changes everything and before long he's right back on track with his normal routine. As far as the guest stars are concerned, Burt Reynolds and Don Rickles were both as sharp as ever. Both had their weird moments but they were clear winners. Dean Martin made a very brief appearance but had the audience in stitches. Now for Buddy Hackett. I guess either you love the guy or you find his humor rather offensive. It was clear from the start that Hackett was NOT funny at all and he tried his best to interrupt every person that Carson was interviewing. Hackett was not funny at all. You could easily tell from the look on Johnny's face that he either wanted Buddy Hackett to shut his mouth and quit interrupting, or he wanted cut to a commercial as soon as possible.

But the worst part came right at the end of Show #2. When the show's episode finally ends and they were showing the end credits, and while the guest stars were shaking hands with Johnny Carson and congratulating him for his 11th anniversary, Buddy Hackett does two things that to me were so disgusting and so low-class that I lost ALL respect for the total jerk. If you look real close, you will see it too and will see what I mean. As far as I am concerned, Hackett could have dropped his pants in front of the audience and it would not have been as disgusting or so offensive as what he does. I was truly shocked. To me it just proves that Buddy Hackett has absolutely no class at all.

Anyway, I'll let everyone else write what about what they thought about the other shows and the Bonus Clips on Volume 6. I could easily write a small novel here because I honestly loved the entire Volume 6 DVD.

If you loved The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, then this DVD is certainly worth your small investment. I highly recommend this one as a sold hit with five (5) STARS all the way.  And YES - all the music is there just as it should be. There's even a short segment where Doc and The Tonight Show orchestra have an opportunity to show off their true talents. And it's also fun to watch the original one minute commercial breaks.

I don't know what more I can say other than FANTASTIC!!",1401235200,16,3483,4.392857142857143

The 1970s episodes are great, not to mention the commercials.
