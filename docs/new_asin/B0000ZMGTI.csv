8005014,3,B0000ZMGTI,"This satire of Hollywood makes no original observations and isn't especially funny. Its satirical targets are very old.

Nick (Joshua Leonard) is a young New Jersey slacker, pretending to be an artist to impress girls. Then his rich, mysterious cousin, Chris (Andy Dick), invites Nick to Los Angeles because Chris thinks someone is trying to kill him.

Once in L.A., Nick is surrounded by people pretending to be someone they're not. Like all those young ""actresses"" sitting around Chris's pool. ""Actresses"" who seem never to work, never even to go on auditions. All they do is gossip, go to parties, get piercings, colonics, etc. WHERE do they GET their money from?

For that matter, where does anyone in L.A. get their money from? Nobody seems to work or have a job. All anyone does is hang around coffee shops at 11 a.m., gossiping, then going to parties at night. Nick keeps asking people what they do for a living, and many seem befuddled by the question.

The ""satire"" is not only unoriginal, but heavy-handed. The phony ""actresses"" are broad caricature, as are so many other characters. There's...

* A crude, rich, obnoxious Jewish lawyer (Michael Lerner), with several divorces under his belt, who lives in an ostentatious mansion. Currently married to a foul-mouthed trophy wife (Tyra Banks), a generation younger than him, whom he branded on the ass while drunk. Isn't that just soooooo ZANY?

* Angela, a chola (Roselyn Sanchez) who's written a screenplay. Alas, her only copy was stolen by a competing gang. So Angela gathers her own homeboys, and they go gunning after her script. That's right. Mexican gangs are now fighting gun battles not over drugs -- but over a screenplay. Isn't that just soooooo WACKY!

(I watched LARCENY partially because Roselyn Sanchez was in it. Alas, she only has a bit part, about 6 or 7 minutes of total screen time.)

* Charles, a fat black Brit (Heavy D), who, well, who doesn't do much of anything except throw parties and, while being loud and fey, talk about ""the colonies"" (i.e., the United States). Then someone suggests he run for mayor of L.A. on a new political party, The Imperials, and so he does.

* A phony Southern Belle (Kirsten Nelson), who also throws a lot of parties, and dates airhead ""actors.""

* An overly perky car rental clerk (Brooke Dillman), with an extreme, and extremely phony, toothy grin, who makes racist comments while smiling perkily.

There's also a serial killer on the loose in L.A. And a pyromaniac. And a seemingly smart, down-to-earth girl reporter (Bellamy Young), who turns out to be into S&M bondage.

Like other reviewers have noted, LARCENY just TRIES TOO HARD to be funny. It goes to extremes in its attempts to be wacky & zany. Nick's visit to L.A. is one long, non-sequitur string of madcap mayhem.

Even so, LARCENY was okay. I never laughed out loud, but I did smile a bit. But then, I have a soft spot for the subject matter. So if you REALLY enjoy Hollywood satires, you MIGHT like this film. But you must REALLY like the genre, to the point of being forgiving.

I've seen better and worse Hollywood satires. One of the best is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jimmy-Hollywood/dp/B0002V7OFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jimmy Hollywood</a>. That film, while still a satire, also has DEPTH. I've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jimmy-Hollywood/dp/B0002V7OFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jimmy Hollywood</a>&nbsp;many times. It's one of my favorite 1990s films.

According to the IMDb, LARCENY was released in 2004. But according to its end credits, the film is copyright 2001. So it seems the film sat on a shelf for three years between its completion and release. Never a good sign.",1416441600,,3767,5.1524590163934425
8005015,4,B0000ZMGTI,"After reading the low reviews on this movie I had low expectations in watching it, but I was quite surprised at how good it actually was, do note that low expectations will help you appreciate this movie a little better. The movie is extremely bizarre and has a gelotinous plot that really takes no shape whatsoever and causes the movie to act out like some sort of strange montage of events (for example, in one scene the main character walks into an empty house, and as he's walking around we see a couple rotweillers presumably running to where he is, but they never get there. The whole film seems to be a satire on pompous big city types and braindead people who contribute nothing and get everything. Really hard to grade this movie cause everybody will experience it in a different way, but if you need sensibility in a film skip this one, if you liked Napoleon Dynamite because it was so different and outrageous then give this one a go, consequently Andy Dick would have been great as Kip. I liked it, but every time I chuckled I shook my head at the same time, it's that kind of funny.",1165017600,3,1095,4.45273631840796
8005016,3,B0000ZMGTI,"Underwear salesman Nick Peters, played by Joshua Leonard (The Blair Witch Project, Scorched) who is brought to LA because his Cousin Chris, played by Andy Dick (Hebrew Hammer, Tv's NewsRadio) thinks that The Collarer Killer has put him on his list and out to kill him and so Dick locks himself in a garage and Nick winds up going undercover to try to find out who the killer is, posing as a painter artist in which he cant paint or do art and when he finds this Collarer Killer, he can go back to home in New Jersey. Along the way, Leonard meets reporter Kiki, played by Bellamy Young who is investiagting the Killer. Funny dark comedy with funny situations but the end is kinda forced. Joshua Leonard delivers a good performance and what a perfect actor like Andy Dick to play Chris...I don't think anyone else would of done a better job. Also starring Michael Lener (No Way Back, The Mod Squad), Dwight ""Heavy D"" Meyers (Big Trouble), Kate Jackson (Tvs Charlies Angels), Roselyn Sanchez (Rush Hour 2, Chasing Papi) and Tyra Banks (Halloween: Resurrection) who was the weakiest and wasted of all the cast members. Some people will probably not like this movie but I certainly enjoyed it for its time...it was worth the look and I aint complaining.",1130630400,,1248,4.65158371040724
8005017,1,B0000ZMGTI,"I haven't been able to get past the 30 minute mark of this movie. I get bored by then, if I'm alone....or embarrased to admit I own this movie if I have company over. I promise to write a thorough review once I watch the whole thing. But be prepared...it's looking like a stinker so far.",1100908800,2,287,4.142857142857143
8005018,2,B0000ZMGTI,"Here's a film that tries so hard to be a satire it misses the mark by way over a mile.  Meant to ridicule a dozen or so inane LA types, the film itself winds up being ridiculously inane. Characters include:
  a self-absorbed British black man who runs for mayor of the city and wins
  two self-absorbed young guys who love dressing up and killing people
  three self-absorbed sexy girls who chatter endlessly and go to lots and lots of parties
  one big fat self-absorbed crude older guy who wallows in his crude self-absorption
  and our hero, Nick, whose own self-absorption leads him from selling underwear in NY City to posing as an upcoming artist
Good satires bring out the substance of the film--the satire--with sharp punchy interaction between the characters.  That's nowhere in evidence here.  The only interaction that occurs between the characters is typically dopey and one-dimensional and stale.  You get tired pretty fast watching this film because no effort's been made to flesh out any character at all by making him/her real.  Because a film is a satire does not mean that the characters are shallow and meaningless, but that seems to be the modus operandi here.
If by giving all characters that personality the filmmaker wants to show how shallow LA itself is, he should look to L.A. Story, Steve Martin's far more successful parody of LA.  While not a great film, L.A. Story does have some very funny scenes that illustrate the superficiality that LA is (e.g., the scene at the outdoor cafe with everyone ordering ridiculous variations of a latte).
The good scenes in L.A. Story work because there is convergence of the characters on a point of satire.  In Larceny, there is very little if any convergence.  The film goes from one damn thing to another, hoping the viewer will laugh at the random shots the film/filmmaker takes at whatever and whoever he finds to take a shot at.
With much sharper writing this could have been a better film.",1083024000,2,1961,4.785714285714286
8005019,3,B0000ZMGTI,"Larceny is a film that rehashes some very familiar comedic cliches about Los Angeles. Yet, despite its flaws, I enjoyed the film's quirky energy and willingness to be silly and bizarre. Joshua Leonard plays Nick, a young man who works in a mall and has no particular direction in life. When he takes an art class to impress the cute teacher, his complete lack of talent quickly exposes him. So, when his cousin Chris (Andy Dick) invites him to stay at  his Beverly Hills mansion, he has nothing to lose. Nick finds all kinds of absurd and sometimes amusing adventures on the West Coast. The parodies of airhead wannabee actresses, hipsters who constantly talk on their cell phones and a life dominated by cars, cafes and parties has certainly been portrayed before (most notably perhaps in L.A. Story), but Larceny does have its moments and has a zany edge lacking in most mainstream films. The rapper Heavy D is quite funny as Charlie, a playboy with no visible means of support. Cousin Chris turns out to be a nutcase who is convinced a serial killer is targeting him. Chris demands that Nick find the killer, which leads to all kinds of improbable scenarios. The running joke of the film is that the talentless Nick must pose as a famous New York artist and no one in the celebrity-crazed LA culture questions this. The story, such as it is, fizzles out at the end, with explanations that don't make sense when earlier scenes are recalled (of course, many films with much bigger budgets also have this shortcoming). Overall, Larceny is an entertaining film that would have been even better with a little more focus on the script.  The cast also has Kate Jackson as Nick's mother and Bellamy Young as Kiki, a reporter who is a romantic interest for Nick.",1080172800,2,1756,4.679611650485437
