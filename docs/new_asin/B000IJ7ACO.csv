While the ""Over Arizona"" DVD is a masterpiece, one can also like very much the ""Dreaming"" series, the Globe Trekker Southwest USA is a misfit, seek the separate reviews of this... how to call it, Ms. Shapiro twisted view of the Southwest?

My other very different problem with this product is that the box holding the DVD's is too narrow. It takes me usually a letter opener wedged in to the box to fiddle out one of the DVD's in a torturous 20min job. Finally I tossed out the ""Trecker DVD"" from the box, which proven to be almost ok for 3 DVD's. Please make the box 1/8 of the inch wider!",1240617600,2,691,4.348837209302325
8145743,4,B000IJ7ACO,"Only one of the DVDs in this set of four DVDs is one of the very good ""Over California"" type of videos.  There is no DVD with the title of ""Over The Southwest"".

The first and best DVD is ""Over Arizona"".  It's a little too short (I wanted to see a lot more), but still quite good.  The pictures are clear and high quality, the music is nice, while the narration is perfect - understated, interesting, and helpful.

The second DVD is also good.  It is an episode of the GlobeTrekker TV series titled ""South West USA"".  A young lady visits fun, scenic, and touristy areas of New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.  Her trip is mostly a happy one, although parts are sort of creepy, ending with views of the Burning Man Festival.

The third DVD is short (26 min but with two sound tracks)  called ""Dreaming Nevada"" with shots of Las Vegas and of beautiful scenic areas and parks around Las Vegas, like Red Rock Canyon.  Quite a lot of ground level shots.  No narration, but some maps and extra information are included on the DVD.

The last DVD is also short (26 min but with two sound tracks) called ""Dreaming Arizona"" with shots of scenic parts of Arizona and Utah, such as Lake Powell, the Grand Canyon, and some small quaint towns in Arizona.  Quite a lot of ground level shots. No narration, but some maps and extra information are included on the DVD.",1212624000,6,1348,4.426829268292683
8145744,4,B000IJ7ACO,"The DVD set is really good, but the music in the ""Dreaming Nevada"" is quite unusual. I'm a Las Vegas strip fan, and the images are nice...but I want more aerial shots...this DVD set has some of it, but not as much as I would want. Still, if you are broke and can't go on a trip to see these beautiful sights at this time, this is a cheap alternative until you get the money and time to see them. Buy the way, these images look like they were photographed between 2000 and 2003 - for the Las Vegas Strip, you can see the ""Wynn"" hotel being built. If you want the latest strip hotel images, this might not be the set for you (but it's still cool to watch).

Also, check out ""Over California"" DVD set - Very similar.

Thanks,
