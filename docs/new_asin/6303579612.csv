687008,4,6303579612,"Noel Coward's popular stage comedy BLITHE SPIRIT comes to the screen with considerable charm and notable performances from Rex Harrison, Constance Cummings, and Margaret Rutherford in this fantasy of a married man whose seance party inadverdently summons up the ghost of his first wife--who promptly moves in, turning him into an ""astrial bigamist.""

The Coward script, which zips along with cool one liners, is well played in the best British 'throw-away' tradition, quick, light, and more than a little acid.  Harrison is neatly cast as the hag-ridden husband, Cummings is particularly charming as the terse second wife, and Dame Margaret Rutherford steals the show as the slightly dotty medium who conjures up the ghost of Harrison's first wife and then can't get rid of her.  Fans of cool English comedy will enjoy it considerably; others, however, may find it all a bit too restrained for their tastes.

687009,1,6303579612,"I purchased this DVD without ever having seen the movie, but I figured I couldn't go wrong with David Lean, Rex Harrison, and Noel Coward. Unfortunately, I didn't take DVD production values (or lack thereof) into consideration.
This is probably a wonderful movie, but the DVD is unwatchable. The sound is absolutely abysmal. I wasn't able to make out Noel Coward's dialog at all. Don't bother getting this DVD; wait for a better transfer.",1003708800,57,438,4.9324324324324325
687010,2,6303579612,"This Rank/Two Cities film directed by David Lean was produced by Noel Coward, an adaptation of his own play with screenplay by Lean, Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan. At first the treatment is exhausting, with snappy repartee reading like Neil Simon in double time. We're trapped in Coward's idea of how married people interact, and the falseness is stagebound. Margaret Rutherford scores a few laughs with her body language as a medium Rex Harrison has invited to his house for a seance. The seance itself is indifferently presented but it is after it is over, when the spirit of Harrison's first wife is conjured up, that the film comes alive too. The humour isn't in the""blithe""-ness of the ghost, it's in the reaction of Harrison's present wife, Constance Cummings, who unlike Harrison is unable to perceive the presence.
It's always amusing to watch movies where the actors have to pretend to ignore other actors playing ghosts, and this seems particularly tough when the garish Techicolour gives Kay Hammond a sickly green glow. One can excuse the obvious incompatibility with Harrison as a youthful error, due to her death, or simply to fit into Coward's scheme. And Lean introduces her by delaying Harrison's acknowledgment, which allows her to witness the situation she has entered. However the gimmick wears thin and there are slow periods we must endure before Coward's mechanics jump us into the next act.
It's a shame that the plot deprives us of Cummings just when we have learned to value her the most, even when she gets to deliver Coward's mysogynistic line about Harrison being ""hag-ridden"". That this notion ultimately becomes the theme of the play is probably more sour than Coward wished to reveal. And the material reads as being unfair to the second wife.
The resulting action is flatulent, with Lean failing to re-energise Rutherford, and a montage of her efforts to exorcise hindered by an obtrusive music score by Richard Addinsell and the London Philharmonic. Lean does manage to invest the climax with slight pathos, though the conclusion is sheer farce.
It is on reflection that one realises how thin this play is. It is said that Coward wrote it in 6 days. In her 5001 Nights at the Movies collection, Pauline Kael tells us that is was prepared to provide war-torn England with some comedy relief, and that on stage it seemed ""pleasantly airy"".
The thing that is most curious in the film is Harrison's wish for the ghost to co-exist with his marriage, that he cannot understand why his living wife can be so disturbed. However if Cummings agreed with this thought, I suppose there would be no conflict, and Harrison thereby has to take this attitude. The final explaination for the appearance somehow involves a servant, a point turned to blather, perhaps evidence of a writer rushing to deadline, but also a question that remains unanswered by the end, with Irving Berlin's Always as a clue.",1002931200,4,2929,4.931174089068826
687011,3,6303579612,"The most interesting thing about ""Blithe Spirit"" is that this, only David Lean's third film as a director, should already incorporate his fully developed style. All of the traits of his more famous work are here: the peerless compositions, the seamless editing, the nuanced use of space and decor. I have never seen the movie projected, and therefore cannot make an informed judgement about the DVD's color fidelity. I suspect the three-strip Technicolor probably has a lot more in it than the video presents, but at least we can still appreciate the director's finely sculpted framings.
The performances by all concerned are high-spirited, tongue-in-cheek, and simply fun, though as the actors natter on and on, the film's theatrical origins begin to poke through. Rex Harrison's readings are precise to the point of painful, while Margaret Rutherford could do with a bit more control. (At her most excessive, you want to say, ""It's all right, dear, sit down, relax and have a nice cup of tea."") These lapses never seriously mar our pleasure, but in those few moments when Lean allows himself a bit of *cinematic* invention, as for example, in an early scene that conveys the passage of time by moving the camera toward a mirror, we get a sense of where the movie might have gone if the director hadn't felt such debt to the writer. (Coward gave Lean his first opportunity to direct, selecting him to co-direct ""In Which We Serve."")
Lean's camera was at its most effective designing reality into impossibly perfect, exquisite images. Here, there's nothing much for him to do but frame the actors a little wider than average, to let a bit of wisteria creep in at the edges of one shot, or to tuck some bric-a-brac into a corner of another. His handsome, slightly stiff style works for a drama, but in comedy, particularly one as theatrical as this, it has the unfortunate effect of making the actors appear like butterflies fluttering their wings as they are pinned down by the camera. ""Blithe Spirit"" is indeed an entertaining film that bears repeated viewings, but you can be forgiven the impression that the director was simply mis-cast.",980812800,,2140,4.898071625344353
687012,4,6303579612,For fans of the amazing late Margaret Rutherford this film is a real treat of her natural comic talents. Without her Rex Harrison's character would not appeal.

687153,5,6303579612,"Adapted from a long-running stage success that was still running in London's West End at the time of release, BLITHE SPIRIT preserves for ever the stellar central performance of Margaret Rutherford as Madame Arcati.

If ever a role was made for this well-loved actor, it was this one. With her vigorous, almost schoolgirl-like enthusiasm for her task and her determination to carry it through, despite the skepticism of her assembled guests, Madame Arcati is a true eccentric. Dressed in a series of sensible skirts and long, floppy scarves, she truly believes she has the power to communicate with the other world. She minces around the room in a series of hops and jigs, places her hands on Charles Condomnine's (Rex Harrison's) occasional table and speaks in portentous tones. If anyone gets in her way, such as Charles's wife Ruth (Constance Cummings), Madame Arcati dismisses them with an imperious wave of the hand. In her chocolate-box-like home, full of bric-a-brac with an enormous parrot at its center, she is truly in control of her surroundings.

Yet even she cannot control the spirit world. At the end she reveals a rare glimpse of her weaker side as she makes every effort to escape the Condomine house once the ghosts of Charles's two deceased wives have been returned to the other side. They might no longer blight his life, but their presence remains tangible; and Madame Arcati knows it. She scurries out of the front door like a frightened rabbit, offering the most perfunctory of farewells to the nonplussed Charles.

Director David Lean has made a wonderful job of opening out Coward's classic. Set in a green, quasi-Edenic world where little seems to change, other than the leaves on the trees, the film makes great play of Charles's car journeys, especially the one where Elvira (Kay Hammond) drives Charles, much to an RAC officer's (Johnnie Schofield's) astonishment. He cannot see Elvira's ghost; so it seems as if the car has no driver.

The interior scenes are equally deftly handled. Cinematographer Ronald Neame is fond of the slow zoom into the characters' faces to register their growing unease at the ghostly events taking place within their midst. He also provides for plenty of comic conflict between Elvira and Ruth: until her untimely demise, Ruth cannot see Elvira, and thinks Charles has lost his senses. On at least two occasions Ruth flounces out of the room, slamming the door behind her, leaving Charles to commune with the dead.

Most of the play's witty dialogue has been retained in the adaptation. Quite why the sleepy Devon village of Budleigh Salterton should seem funny remains a mystery; but Harrison and Hammond have great fun with it as they reveal their past adulteries to one another.

The film is quite short - ninety minutes in length - but the action zips by at a great lick, proving once and for all (if we did not already know it) that BLITHE SPIRIT is Noel Coward's greatest play, and remains indestructible, seventy-five years after its stage premiere.",1469836800,6,3015,4.936883629191321

687349,2,6303579612,"Dreadful play and worse film.  The film's witty repartee is forced and spoken too quickly to indulge amusement.  Its crayon-bright cinematography is downright repugnant--the green ghosts are nauseating.  The whole thing is puff performance of narrative contrivance.  Put simply, the agon is dishonest and pretentious.  At issue is not a widower's grief, but rather a second wife's annoyance at the lingering presence of her husband's former spouse, harassment masked as haunting.  Dame Margaret's happily unmarried medium amounts to a divorce lawyer profiting by a couple's losses.  If received as a study of divorce, the drama is insightful and arrives at the earned nihilistic conclusion that divorce unites people in lovelessness, that marriage is forever, that only death parts brides and grooms, and that the separation afforded by divorce is a living hell.  See BLITHE SPIRIT to parse it, to embrace the material truths confounded by its spiritual lies.  Better yet, read Percy Bysshe Shelley's ""To a Skylark,"" a fine and honest work after which BLITHE SPIRIT is unworthy to be named.",1438732800,,1090,5.3274853801169595

687354,4,6303579612,"Noel Coward's witty and astringent supernatural  comedy finally receives a crisp, color transfer on DVD. Given the popularity of the play on which it is based, this is one classic that is hard to find; at least at an affordable price and on Region 1 DVD. Region 2 DVD will not play in America. I did not purchase the Critereon Collection edition, but rather the ""David Lean Collection: Rank Classics"" DVD, which features a crisp, vibrant color transfer. The price was very affordable. I did buy it online, but not here on Amazon.
 Snobby and secure  novelist Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison) holds a seance at his house so he can get material for his next book. Charles and his guests, including his second wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) regard breezy medium Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford) as an eccentric, silly joke. The joke, it turns out, is on them. Madame Arcati manages to conjure up the ghost of Charles' first wife Elvira (Kay Hammond). And she doesn't have the first notion of how to send Elvira back to ""The Other Side."" At first, only Charles can see Elvira; which causes Ruth to think that Charles and herself are going out of their minds. Eventually, however, Ruth believes that Elvira is not only in the house, but also a deadly threat. The plot is basically a delightful mix of marital bickering (Charles is caught between two wives) and the supernatural.
  Rex Harrison is a bit too relaxed. I  wish he had been more snappish with his ghost wife Elvira. That would have given their fights more of a bite.
Similarly, Kay Hammond's performance lacks necessary  energy and ""spirit."" This is unfortunate, since Elvira causes all sorts of supernatural shenanigans and loves creating trouble between Charles and Ruth. Constance Cummings is quite good as Ruth, who is not at all amused at having Elvira as an uninvited house guest. Margaret Rutherford is a delightful hoot as Madame Arcati, who is a bit too good at her supernatural profession.
  Noel Coward's witty dialogue and plot are really the main attraction here. Director David Lean keeps everything going at a brisk pace. The film's running time is a swift and fun 96 minutes.",1430524800,,2151,4.839237057220709

687532,3,6303579612,"A few folks are either reviewing the wrong product, or old reviews are being forwarded to this product:  What I watched, with the green image of Elvira, with her red painted lips and mouth on the cover, is a magnificent restoration of the original film---with images so full of depth and clarity that it at one point works against one of the actresses...

Criterion Collection is known for the quality of its DVD's and the restored prints they specialize in, and this film is no exception.  The jewel like quality of the house bar---and the cocktails in glasses (although I've never seen an amber martini made from gin...) are gorgeous;  the room is in high relief---down to the pattern on the drapes, although other, less interesting rooms show more detail than architectural inspiration, and then there's  the otherwise beautiful Constance Cummings (who plays Charles Condomine's---Rex Harrison-- living wife) who is shown in such high relief that it's quite clear she's had her face coated with studio foundation make up, in all it's opaque glory.  It's a minor distraction.  The film is so beautifully restored that just watching it is a pleasure.

The story...  Well, it's not my favorite, and I like the screwball genre, but it made me want to see the play, with Angela Lansbury, which was not the reaction I had when I tried to watch the old faded version, which I never finished.  It's full of clever dialogue, which is what we expect from Noel Coward.  He wasn't thrilled with this version of his play, but he refused to let US studios make the film of it as what they had done to his work appalled him.  This print includes Harrison's line about his sex life that was cut from the original US release.  ""Blythe Spirit"" tells the story of a sophisticated set of couples who host a seance in order that Mr. Condomine can get information on Mediums that he can use for a novel he's planning.  Margaret Rutherford, who plays the medium, knows nothing of this, and it's not clear whether she's a hoax or just a second rate version of the form, but Ms. Rutherford brings a scattershot manic energy to the role that is as entertaining as it is occasionally distracting.  As things will, the seance gets a bit out of  control and Condomine's  late first wife shows up, and she's still so attracted to him that she decides to kill him, so he can be with her forever.  Sadly, for her, the plan goes awry and she ends up killing the current wife, who is none too happy to find herself dead, and with the late wife, in the same house, at that!

Any more would be a spoiler.

The story and its telling is most certainly dated.  Then again, its technicolor production is so brilliantly restored that it adds an immediacy to the past that eclipses so much of what most of us would consider to be what so badly dates the film in the first place.  It's unfortunate that they decided to make Kay Hammond's dead Elvira a sort of onyx green, dressed in the same color gown, with fire engine red lips and fingernails, rather than simply double exposing her for transparency, but they did, and after a while one gets over it.

687726,4,6303579612,"Blithe Spirit (David Lean, 1945)

David Lean is one of those all the pros are really in love with this guy directors whose films I rarely seem to get round to watching. This confuses me somewhat, because when I do watch a Lean film, I find it immensely enjoyable; I've only seen two so far, but Lawrence of Arabia, as of this writing, is sitting at #121 on my all-time top 1000 list, and Blithe Spirit entered the list at #541. Both are phenomenal pictures. A stage performance of Blithe Spirit had just closed its run right across the street from where I work a couple of weeks before I sat down to watch the movie; by the time it was over, I was kicking myself for not having gone to see the play. That strikes me as the best recommendation I can give the silly, wonderful thing.

Charles Condomine  (My Fair Lady's Rex Harrison) and his new wife Ruth (The Criminal Code's Constance Cummings) have moved back into the old pile after the honeymoon. The only problem is, the ghost of Charles' late first wife, Elvira (Two on a Doorstep's Kay Hammond), is still very much around and causing mischief for the happy couple. Charles, distressed by the goings-on, hires the medium Madame Arcati (the wondrous comic actress Margaret Rutherford) to get to the bottom of thingswhich just makes Elvira all the more determined to pursue her ulterior agenda...

As you can tell by the first paragraph, I am shockingly unfamiliar with the work of David Lean. But between this and Lawrence, which are such entirely different pieces of work, I find it hard to believe the man could have done anything wrong. Lawrence is a massive four-hour (admittedly quite doctored) biopic, epic in every way, dramatic and sweeping and saturated with those brilliant, brilliant colors. This movie is its polar opposite in every waylean, slapstick, looking almost colorized, intimate and packed with impeccable comic timing. The ending is a bit of a downerno, wait, that's the wrong word for it. Compared to the rest of the movie, quality-wise, the ending is a bit of a downer; it's the one place where Lean steps over the line from brilliant slapstick into cheesiness (it's Jerry Lewis as opposed to the Preston Sturges of the rest of the film). But that doesn't matter much, because the rest of it is so good. Well worth your time. *** ",1390953600,,2308,4.674876847290641

A young Rex Harrison is the writer of a ghost story who engages a high spirited medium played by a not so old Margaret Rutherford, who conjures up his recently deceased wife, played by Constance Cummings.  The ghost is not willing to share her husband, so she contrives to have him all for herself by the simple expedient of killing him.  Her plan goes awry when his wife, played by Kay Hammond, gets killed, instead.  Now two sexy ghosts are fighting for Rexie's body.

A fond look at some great stars, and it a pleasure to see David Lean's simple camera direction.

The play is pure 1930's-40's fantasy and escape written and performed at the highest level.  Margaret Rutherford is usually the one who walks off with the greatest applause, however I don't agree.  Yes, she is superb but so are all the other members of the cast.  I was not an adult during this period, but I was born then and I feel strongly that films such as this need to be understood within the context which they were made.  Yes, it can be enjoyed without knowing anything of the turmoil going on in the world -- just for what it is, and that is no small point given the total garbage that Hollywood produces.  My point is that it has an even deeper level which represents a parallel between the Rutherford role and the role of the audience:  The need to believe in all that is magical.

Take all of the above as given, yet this film would be nothing without Noel Coward's superb writing; Lean's direction and every member of the cast.  As an avid film collector I've come to rely on respected names.  Even when I don't know the work, if I am familiar with the people who made it, I buy it.  Seldom have I been disappointed.

David Lean's Technicolor is always exquisite, and never more so than in the complicated color designs of BLITHE SPIRIT, in which Charles and Ruth Condomine (Rex Harrison and Constance Cummings) sail through a variety of tweedy outfits that are so brilliantly detailed you can ""read"" every tooth in the houndstooth.  (And Cummings has some wonderful period evening gowns that still look exquisite--she has a lovely figure here and always looks great, even when you're struggling to learn to like her.)

And then there's Elvira (Kay Hammond), summoned back from the dead by whom?  (I won't say here, because that's the central mystery of the film, but it's a shocking solution.)  Elvira, once Charles's first wife, was a serial flirt and cheater but she had life to her--more so than Ruth, and at first when she returns you tend to like her and her sodden attitude towards everything romantic and divine.  In comparison, Ruth suddenly seems ultra middleclass.  Hammond, not often seen on screen, makes an indelible impression--she's sort of squat and round, but sexy, she's like Joan Blondell gone rotten--and her wardrobe and makeup add to the impression, for her skin is painted a pale yellowy green and her blonde curls seem waterlogged, squishy, and yet her scarlet nails and mouth are still vibrant and ""jungle red,"" like Kylie Minogue's in her video for her new single ""2 Hearts.""  I wonder if the brainstorming design team always buzzing around Kylie caught a glimpse of Kay Hammond in BLITHE SPIRIT and decided that was the look they want to recreate.  Anyhow it's almost like a miasma of death that surrounds Elvira, who is also lit in white, blue and yellow lights so she possesses an altogether different reality than the living mortals she goes around smirking at.  It's not horrible but it plays close to it, closer than one ordinarily thinks wartime UK film capable of.

Margaret Rutherford meanwhile is in her own dimension as Madame Arcati, half Girl Guide, half elemental herself, always swinging two or three sets of beads around her neck, always in motion, her tufts of hair swirling all points of the compass as she's always on the lookout for the otherworldly.  When Elvira obliges Charles by blowing air onto Margaret Rutherford's cheek, then her bare elbow, and Rutherford explodes into a near carnal ecstasy, it's the most obviously sexual moment in all of Lean's film work.",1200182400,4,2565,4.9257540603248255
687969,4,6303579612,"The story if not the film has held up well over the years.  Rex Harrison and Kay Hammond have a fun time rekindling their old love.  The only probably is that Charles' dear wife, Elvyra, is dead, and he has to try to convince his new wife, Ruth, that this is a spirit, with a delightfully malevolent quality as it turns out, haunting his life.  Unfortunately, the film quality has deteriorated and the technicolor no longer seems so bright.  Elvyra is a miserable green, one assumes from envy, to see her husband has a new love in his life, for in her mind nothing could replace the love she felt for him.  The story has been told countless times, but the repartee between Rex Harrison and Kay Hammond is hard to match, not to mention Margaret Rutherford taking a wonderful turn as Madame Arcati.",1188777600,,796,4.5
687970,3,6303579612,"I saw this play done well at the Williamstown Theatre Festival recently. So, I was interested to see how it had been treated on the silver screen. I think 3 of the 4 main characters were done well.

This adaptation fell flat around Kate Hammond's performance as Elvira. She really failed to  portray someone you could believe died laughing. The ghastly green makeup didn't help her, either. The director could have convinced us she was a ghost without going the sledgehammer route.

Beyond that there were some minor annoyances. The soundtrack stepped on the dialog at some points, which is especially bad in this sort of piece. The ending is poorer than the stage version. Several bits of dialog that added to the cheekiness of the play were dropped in the adaptation. Finally, the editing was a bit too choppy for my taste.",1185926400,2,825,4.755244755244755
687971,3,6303579612,"This is a fine production of an extremely lightweight play.  No wonder that so many high schools used to perform it.  This is definitely not a ""sex romp,"" as the puff piece states, and it isn't even slightly suggestive in that regard.  It's about quarreling, endless bickering about the existence of an ex-wife, a spirit, in the room.  The ""one-liners"" aren't at all amusing, and the ending is as absurd as its beginning.  Three cheers for four of England's finest actors.  But there isn't much one can do with such a turkey script.  If you're into this sort of thing, try Topper.

688023,5,6303579612,"Rex Harrison is a novelist researching spiritualism; during a seance his dead first wife is conjured up. Naturally she causes chaos in his once-happy home. When his second wife is killed, he now has two ghosts on his hands. He tries to get rid of both spirits, but fails, and decides it would be better to just join them in the hereafter. The movie is done all so lightheartedly that much of the humor is lost, or at least diluted. Harrison grieves over the loss of neither wife, which makes it sort of pointless. Best by far is Margaret Rutherford who plays the medium. The picture isn't all that bad as a bit of fluff for wartime Brits to forget about Hitler for 90 minutes.",1135382400,4,676,4.416
688024,5,6303579612,"This is the film adaptation of Noel Coward's comedic play. It is a fast-paced, drolly funny, comedic fantasy of the kind in which the British always excel. The screenplay is sharply acerbic and witty, with  the actors engaged in the rapid-fire delivery of its lines. As they say, timing is everything, and here, the timing could not be better.

The plot revolves a well-known novelist, Charles Condomine, played by the ever urbane Rex Harrison. He has been married to his second wife, the no-nonsense Ruth (Constance Cummings) for the past five years, after having been a widower for seven. They live in a lovely house in the English countryside. As part of his research for a new novel that he is writing, he has arranged for a small dinner party, inviting another couple as well as  an eccentric medium who calls herself Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford).

After dinner,  Madame Arcati conducts a seance. She makes a series of rather odd and funny attempts to speak to the spirit world, and something changes, but the only one who knows it is Charles. It seems that Madame Arcati has conjured up the spirit of his long dead wife, Elvira (Kay Hammond), but the only one who can see and hear her is him.

Of course, the re-appearance of Elvira creates all kinds of mischief in the household, both upstairs and downstairs. Needless to say, Ruth is not happy, when Charles reveals what has happened, and while initially skeptical, she quickly becomes a believer when she sees things happen that are otherwise inexplicable.

When it becomes clear that  Elvira is not going to go willingly, and Ruth is not going to let her rival stay without putting up a fight, Charles is caught in the middle. He soon finds out, however, that Elvira has special plans for him that soon backfire on all of them. When Madame Arcati is called back to try and put things to right, more mischief is concocted by those in the spectral realm.

Excellent performances are given by the entire cast. For my money, however, it is Margaret Rutherford who steals the show out from under her fellow thespians for her wacky, over the top performance as Madame Arcati. Margaret Rutherford infuses her character with a wonderful combination of British bluster and eccentric mannerisms that makes Madame Arcati absolutely memorable and quite funny.

This darkly humorous production is deftly directed by David Lean, and, while it could have used some fine-tuning towards the end, it is a minor point. Those who love wonderful vintage films will certainly enjoy this one.",1108252800,22,2536,4.849537037037037
688025,5,6303579612,"I must say, this was a bloody good film.  Unlike the other older films that I have watched this one actually had originality, spunk, and a whole lot of fun.  Blithe Spirit is the story of a couple that is happy in every way.  Rex Harrison and Constance Cummings play a couple, Charles and Ruth Condomine, who have been married for five years. This is both of theirs second marriage.  They are seemingly wealthy due to Harrison's books that he has written. His next book is about the supernatural, so he has invited the local gypsy to their house on night to not only study what she does, but also for a form of entertainment.

Wonderfully played by Margaret Rutherford, Madame Arcati (the gypsy) makes her entrance and immediately sets the tone for the remainder of the film. She runs around the room like a hyperactive child, standing ... sitting ... running ... and jumping she puts on a great performance for those watching.  After the sance is completed with no results, the two couples find themselves laughing as Arcati leaves for the night. The only one not laughing is Harrison. He has discovered that his dead wife has actually risen from the grave and can see and talk to him. The only trouble, Harrison is the only one that can see her. Harrison, hysterical in a Hugh Grant sort of way, is not so much frightened that she is a ghost, but that his ex-wife is back in the same room as he. He spends the evening, to his current wife's displeasure, talking to Edith (his first wife) about her current disposition.  Humor, suspicion, and creative filmmaking continue throughout the rest of this film.  The ending to this film surprised me, but also kept well within the themes of this film. Rex Harrison has proved that he was one of Britain and Hollywood's greatest assets.

After my first two run ins with 1940-1950s cinema, I was ready to be board and asleep by now, instead I am awake and have a huge smile on my face. It is so impressive to see such quality and original work come from this time period.  Looking at the most recent horror/thriller cinema that has graced our screens lately like The Others, The Sixth Sense, and even The Ring, it was a joy to sit back and enjoy a comedy that combines the same elements from these into a very funny caper.  Taken from a play by author Noel Coward, Blithe Spirit sharpens your intellect and brings you deep into the world of British comedy.

The casting was perfect. This is actually my first Rex Harrison film, and I cannot wait to see him again. The style of acting that he has, and it may have just been for this film, is not only sharp, but directly on cue.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the old gypsy.  Her facial expressions, plus mannerisms showed that she was very excited about this part.  The concept of this film was extraordinary.  Since I have only seen a handful of 1940s films, the plot and elements in this film far exceed the others plus some of the cinema released today.

I love British humor. I loved the fact that after the first ten minutes, nobody was scared of these ghosts. It was like it was the normality of life for these characters.  It took a little longer for Ruth to be comfortable, but Charles stepped right into it.  Add to this mix a surprise element about Charles' marriage brings continual laughter and surprises.  So, not only do we have ghosts in the house, but we also have a crumbling marriage.  Not only do we have a very funny film about ghosts, but we also have an ending that I did not see coming at all.

Overall, it was not just a funny ghost film, but instead a funny ghost film with a pinch of ""who-dun-it"".  If you are in the movie store looking for that 1940s film that will tie you over for the night, please check out Blithe Spirit. I think you will thoroughly enjoy it. No spooky in any way, just straight out fun!!

688026,5,6303579612,"The London reviewer and I are of one accord on the perfection of this exercise in WIT as defined by Pope: ""True wit is nature to advantage dressed / What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed."" I did not live between the two World Wars and so did not have the privilege of interfacing with the great characters in everyday life then who occupied the charming English country towns of that era. But curiously, I instantly felt I was witnessing a true slice of life when I first viewed this GEM from Noel Coward. Of course, Frank Capra (in ""You Can't Take It With You"") and C.S. Lewis had put us on notice that folks on both sides of the Pond in the '30s and '40s were dabbling in the dangerous pastime of spiritism and would get themselves into all sorts of mischief when they did. I consider it a tribute to the masterful direction of ""Blithe Spirit"" that I, a Connecticut baby-boomer born in 1950 and of Irish descent, instantly knew I was viewing real English society in this film. There is a certain delicious human authenticity to this comedy of errors ... I find it just plain irresistible. I love seeing the human spirit portrayed enjoyably in film or in literature (often through gentle social satire), and for reasons I'll never quite understand, I so love this silly, enchanting story and come back to it again and again. Dear reviewer, you are joined by cultural brethren wherever the good breeze of human reflection blows across the arts.
Permit me to make two recommendations for you. One is the film, ""The Late George Apley"" (a worthy, if truncated, distillation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel) -- hard but not impossible to find, and again a gentle look at the foibles of mankind in a gentler time that I prize, even though I was born after it. Another is an out-of-print (but relatively easy-to-obtain) collection of short stories about characters in the British Isles in the late 19th century: ""Grandmother and the Priests,"" by Taylor Caldwell, who takes us inside the lives of marvelous characters we would like to have met, in one of the most breathtaking exhibitions of literature offered in 20th century literature. Thank you for standing up for the right stuff in your praise of ""Blithe Spirit.""",1077840000,10,2227,4.698209718670077
688027,3,6303579612,"""Blithe Spirit"" has Rex Harrison in his acerbic bachelor mode unable to get rid of either of his dead wives.  Now if that's not a knock-out premise, I don't know what is, yet this film fell flat for me.  This came out the same year as David Lean's other 1946 release, ""Brief Encounter,"" but it doesn't have any of that film's elegance and style.  ""Blithe Spirit"" feels pretty anonymous from a filmmaking standpoint.
However, this movie's strength is its writing.  The screenplay is terrific, and all of the lines are delivered with such throw away dryness that I have the feeling I could watch this again and find everything funnier than I did the first time.
No quibbles with the performances, though no one is asked to stretch him/herself much.  My favorite performance probably came from Kay Hammond, playing Harrison's first dead wife.  Others rave about Margaret Rutherford, but I found her a bit too mannered and spastic.
I love that movies like this won Oscars for special effects.  They're so quaint and fake, but you know the artists had to be so inventive to pull stuff like this off in the pre-computer era.
My most negative comments concern the quality of the DVD itself.  I wholeheartedly agree with previous commenters on the horrible color and sound quality on display here.  I wish the film had been in black and white, because the copy I saw was washed out and ugly.  And my wife and I missed about the first 20 minutes of dialogue because of bad sound.
If you want to own a copy of ""Blithe Spirit,"" I wouldn't buy this one.  But it's fine for renting.
