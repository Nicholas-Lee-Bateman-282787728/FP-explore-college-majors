2445613,5,B000BYA4EM,"I bought this dvd for my daughter because I needed something to keep her entertained while I did house work.  At first, it didn't work.  She was bored of it and than one day I decided to go and buy her a portable dvd player.  I played the dvd in the car for her and man o man did she love it.  It's great.  My husband and I even love it.  I am able to put her in her high chair while I wash dishes and she'll just sit there and watch it.  I can do just about anything know.  I just have to make sure I put the dvd on for her to watch.  Good dvd.  Give it a chance.  I wish they had more.

2445614,1,B000BYA4EM,"My 18 mo old is an Elmo freak!  She hated this dvd.  I put it in and she cried until I put in one of her old ones.  No story, not much dialog, and NO fun.  This is horribly boring!  I don't even think my 4 mo old would be impressed.",1153267200,,232,3.4705882352941178
2445615,5,B000BYA4EM,"This is Fun.  I have a two year old and a five year old and they both love the songs.  My two year old actually started doing some of the movements and songs with her doll.  My five old loves this because she really loves music and loves to sing.  I caught myself singing some of the songs throughout the day.

My five year old reads chapter books and does multiplication so this is not to knock the whole learning experience.  My view is that kids need to have fun and spend time with their parents.  This DVD really helps in doing both.",1151712000,,538,4.165048543689321
2445616,5,B000BYA4EM,"I bought this video for my 8 month old son, Luke.  He LOVES it!!!!  This video calms him down when he starts crying.  The amazing thing though is my 4 year old daughter, Lindsey is also CRAZY about this DVD.  They have very catchy songs that all the family (my husband & I included) find ourself singing during the day.  We like it when our 4 yr old daughter beggs to watch it.  This video is very enjoyable!!!!!!!!!

Overall...  I would HIGHLY sugest this video!!!  I only wish they had more then just the two videos out.",1151539200,,522,4.298969072164948
2445617,4,B000BYA4EM,"This is the first video we got from the Sesame Beginnings series, so while I can't compare it to the other video, I have to give it a very enthusiastic two thumbs up and I know my daughter (21 mos.) would if she could, too! It is very engaging, with fun songs that stick in your head (but mostly in a good way - there is only one song I find a little annoying) and very cute characters. Each of the familiar muppets (Elmo, Cookie Monster, Prairie Dawn and Big Bird) is featured as a baby or toddler and each has a different caregiver (father/grandmother/mother/aunt respectively). Wayne Brady is a sort of ""host"" who introduces the different chapters of the story along with his daughter. Each song features muppets in action combined with engaging shots of ""real"" parents and children interacting to the music. The music varies from a ""swing"" tune to a very sweet version of the familiar ""Twinkle Twinkle"". The video is short (30 min.) but I think that is because of the target audience's age range. We've really been enjoying it around here - in fact, my problem is that my daughter won't stop asking for it!",1150243200,,1110,4.555
2445618,1,B000BYA4EM,"We bought this DVD, after we purchesed Sesame Beginnings: Beginning Together. The first Dvd is really good - 5 stars. But this Dvd is bad. The songs are not good as at the first dvd and my 16 month old doesn` t like it at all.",1145491200,,226,3.9347826086956523
2445619,2,B000BYA4EM,I was excited to buy this DVD because I like Sesame Street's educational philosophy. I was disappointed because the songs weren't very engaging and the dialog was worse. My nine month old loves Signing Time and Baby Einstein and good music in general and wasn't at all interested in the Make Music Together DVD. I didn't enjoy it either.,1145491200,3,337,4.728813559322034
2445620,4,B000BYA4EM,"I don't have kids of my own, but when I heard the controversy around the Sesame Beginnings (you know, how some doctors believe kids under 2 should not be exposed to TV), I wandered into a local store and picked up a copy of this title.  When I was a kid I was totally crazy about the Sesame Street gang.  Anyway, this is a really fun DVD to watch, esp. when you're cooking or just plain bored with life.  The music is upbeat and it really makes you feel good about life.  And the baby muppets are so cute!  I think, with the adults' approval, I'll get this and other Sesame Beginnings titles as baby shower gifts in the future.",1144886400,9,627,4.191666666666666
2445621,5,B000BYA4EM,"It was cute and fun to see the sesame street characters as babies with their parents and relatives. My little one loves it, she is 14 months old and I just bought her both videos in the set. They dance and sing and encourages play with your little ones. The songs have a catchy and upbeat  tune to them. I know the news had these videos portrayed as being bad for your toddler because the AAP says toddlers under 2 should not watch TV. But lets get real... your kids are going to SEE tv, especially if you have other kids in your house. I know that with these videos, I do have control over what she is viewing so she is not just sitting and watching TV, but programs that have been carefully picked out for her. These videos are nice and holds her attention for at least 30 mins. She dances around to the songs... i love it...",1144540800,5,827,4.16875
2445645,5,B000BYA4EM,These movies can keep my son interested for hours! They're very cute and totally worth buying more then one of them!,1393545600,,116,4.571428571428571
2445646,5,B000BYA4EM,I now have two sesame beginning DVD's for my twins. Beginning together & Make music together. My twins love these dvd's I will now be purchasing the other two that we do not have. These DVDs are educational and set a great example on how to create fun while doing daily necessities with babies.,1385424000,,294,4.462962962962963
2445647,5,B000BYA4EM,"These have been excellent in my daughter's growth and learning.  I love that I can use this along w/teaching my daughter things and she absolutely loves this.  Never saw her have such a long attn. span either.  So wish they had continued to make, we cannot get enough of these!!!",1381708800,,279,4.54
2445648,4,B000BYA4EM,but my toddler doesn't like it as much as he likes the other sesame beginnings videos.  This is a fun video to watch.,1378684800,,117,4.086956521739131
2445649,5,B000BYA4EM,"Wayne Brady is delightful and my baby loves all the funny sounds he makes.

This is a winner video. I still think that the first video with Brandi is the best one, but this is a close 2nd.

:)",1368144000,,192,3.8974358974358974
2445650,5,B000BYA4EM,My grandaughter LOVES this video. She's 1 and 1/2 and loves to dance to the music on this video every time!,1356480000,,107,4.142857142857143
2445651,5,B000BYA4EM,"I first picked up this DVD from the library, hoping that it would be a change from the Baby Einstein videos that were in our rotation for my then 6-month old. At that time I never watched it, but my mother-in-law said that my daughter really loved the video. We ended up getting a copy of the video for my daughter's first birthday though and it has been played nearly non-stop since getting it. I will often be watching something for myself on TV when she will bring me the DVD case in an effort to get me to change it to something that she wants to watch. Contrary to the opinions expressed by some, I have found this video to be engaging and fun. The dialogue isn't over the top or too much, but just the right mix to provide a nice transition from each song part. The songs are catchy and interactive and we often find ourselves singing them even when the video isn't on. I have even used some of the songs as a soother while taking Christmas portraits where she wasn't cooperative, when I sang the songs I got huge smiles and lots of clapping. This is a wonderful DVD!",1325548800,4,1073,4.264705882352941
2445652,5,B000BYA4EM,My baby loves this but he is only 3 months old. He especially loves the sections with Elmo. I like the emphasis on singing and etc. and I find it pretty cute too. Basically I like the Elmo and Cookie Monster characters but find the sections with Prairie Dawn and her mom annoying. My kid doesn't seem to notice though and really seems to enjoy this dvd.,1321228800,2,353,4.2835820895522385
2445653,5,B000BYA4EM,"My 1 year old daughter has hepatoblastoma, a rare form of liver cancer found in babies and toddlers.  We are in and out of the hospital a lot and they have a room filled with books, DVDs and toys that the kids can watch and play with.  One of the nurses brought in the Sesame Beginnings: Make Music Together DVD for us to watch and we were hooked right away!  We love dancing and singing all of the songs, which my husband knows all the words too LOL  Our daughters first birthday is coming up and i plan on buying several of these Sesame Beginnings DVDs for all of us to enjoy!  We cant wait to watch all of the other DVDs! :D",1305244800,2,627,4.065040650406504
2445654,4,B000BYA4EM,"I bought this dvd because it was also in spanish and my baby only watches it in spanish. She is 6 months old and likes watching the fluffy figures, she smiles and dances with them. I don't give it 5 stars because although they use good spanish the names of the characters remain in english eventhough they have their own name in spanish.",1297900800,,337,4.365079365079365
2445685,2,B000BYA4EM,"My daughter didn't care much about it, either, she is 20 months old. She was really excited to watch it, but lost interest quickly into the first song. I found it annoying, all the squaky voices, too much fuzz and not fun.",1296172800,,222,4.309523809523809
2445686,2,B000BYA4EM,"I thought this would be the perfect DVD for my son's 1st birthday party ""band of babies"" to play along to.  However, half of the DVD is spent with talking about making music with children, not actually making music.  35% of the DVD was music, the other 15% was fluff.  I was not pleased at all.  There are more musically fun moments on Play with me Sesame.  Don't waste your money.  This DVD is only worth $5 tops.",1289952000,,414,4.243589743589744
2445687,5,B000BYA4EM,"My 21 month old is still enjoying this DVD after a year. Also, I like that the scenes with the parents motivate you to watch and play with your child. This DVD is not like other DVD's that you just plop down in front of the TV to watch. The songs are catchy and very interactive. We especially like ""Bump Baby"", ""Ma-ma-mama"", and ""Twinkle Twinkle."" My child doesn't like the regular Sesame Street DVD's and we haven't tried watching any other Sesame Beginnings DVD's because she's so happy with this one. I would definitely recommend this. My child's other favorite DVD's are ""Swingset Mamas"", ""Baby Moves"", ""Letter Factory"", and all the ""Signing Times"" DVD's.",1252540800,,660,4.798245614035087
2445688,5,B000BYA4EM,"My 18-month-old daughter loves this DVD! She loves to dance along to the songs, and she loves to sing these songs.  All day she'll prompt me to sing with her ""ma ma mommy"", and she loves the ""bump baby"" song, too. The length is perfect for a toddler's attention span (30 minutes).",1245715200,,280,4.384615384615385
2445689,4,B000BYA4EM,"The DVD is only about 5 songs long.  All the songs have motions that are interactive with the kids.  I only gave it four stars because two of the songs are about taking naps (which I did not think fit in an active video). Also the narrator gets a little preachy.  I could have done without the lecture on how music and songs help children learn, etc.  It just did not fit.  That said, my 16 month old likes the songs and dances along.",1228608000,,434,4.119047619047619
2445690,5,B000BYA4EM,"This is my 23-month-old's absolute favorite movie.  He anticipates each scene and even tries to play along on our piano (well, bang along anyway).  He bounces and dances with the characters.  Definitely worth buying - we could play it every day and he'd still adore it.",1213920000,,269,4.804347826086956
2445691,2,B000BYA4EM,"My son didn't care too much for it & the high pitched, squeaky voices were too much for me.",1205971200,,91,3.8421052631578947
2445692,5,B000BYA4EM,"My daughter loves this DVD! Since we are from Hawaii the twinkle twinkle little star song in Hawaiian is fabulous! This is a must have for children of all ages, my daughter is only 12wks but she just loves the music and of course Elmo.",1203984000,,235,4.2444444444444445
2445693,5,B000BYA4EM,"My son has been watching this video for several months & it is still his favorite video! Everyday, he gives me the dvd to put on & watches it over & over & over. It's great for infants & toddlers because it's all music & the characters are cute little babies. My son loves music & loves to dance so it keeps him glued to the tv. He can't get enough of it! It tells several short musical ""stories"" about Baby Elmo, Cookie Monster, Big Bird & Prairie Dawn. In each story, it shows real babies & their mommies dancing too. This is a great video & a nice change from the traditional Sesame Street videos.",1198713600,,600,4.181034482758621
2445694,5,B000BYA4EM,"THIS IS THE BEST DVD FOR AN INFANT!
I AM A MOTHER OF 4 AND I KNOW WHICH DVD'S ATTRACT AND WHICH DO NOT. THIS ONE WENT UP AGAINST THE POPULAR EINSTEIN DVD'S AND WERE NOT ONLY BETTER, BUT CHEAPER TOO!
MY THREE MONTH OLD HAS WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER.
MY HUSBAND AND I KNOW ALL THE WORDS AND SING THEM TO HER ON A DAILY BASIS. EVEN WITHOUT THE TELEVISION, SHE KNOWS THE SONGS WHEN SHE HEARS THEM AND SMILES. NEVER FAILS!!!
EVEN THOUGH HER CARSEAT FACES THE BACKSEAT, I TOSS IT RIGHT INTO THE DVD PLAYER IN THE CAR SO SHE CAN AT LEAST HEAR IT. MY CHILD WENT FROM HATING THE CAR TO LOVING IT!
THIS IS THE BEST DVD OUT OF THE ENTIRE COLLECTION! WE HAVE ALL FOUR!",1189468800,5,657,3.9473684210526314
2445705,2,B000BYA4EM,"I bought this DVD after having read the glowing reviews for it on Amazon. I am sorry to say that I ended up watching more of it than my toddler did, and even I was not that impressed. I happen to LIKE the Baby Einsten DVDs, and my daughter ADORES them- especially the Baby Da Vinci. She is 20 months old and has liked them all since she was an infant. This DVD felt stilted, too scripted and slow to me. She didn't watch it either. I would recommend most of the Baby Einsten DVDs over this at any time.",1173744000,,502,4.03
2445706,5,B000BYA4EM,Don't listen to the other reviewer Sonja Knight.  This is by far the best one out there.  My daughter has them all and this is the only one that she will sit and watch.  The other Sesame Beginnings are not horrible but definitely not the best ones.,1173484800,,248,4.23404255319149
2445707,3,B000BYA4EM,"After my daughter fell in love with ""Beginning Together"", I decided to purchase another DVD in the series--""Make Music Together"".  However, this one came up flat when compared to ""Beginning Together"".

After reading that ""Make Music Together"" features Wayne Brady and his daughter, I anticipated a lively and humorous performance, but Wayne's interaction with his daughter was flat.  She was a shy and nonresponsive young girl--which is OK in the real world, but made for a bad DVD.

""Beginning Together"" featured singer, Brandy and her daughter.  They interacted well together, and her daughter was very outgoing and laughed alot, and loved the Sesame Street characters.  Aside from the muppets' singing, this made the DVD entertaining.

Wayne's interaction with his daughter fell short and made the DVD less enjoyable than ""Beginning Together"".  If you don't have ""Beginning Together"", get it instead of this one.",1172188800,,915,5.34965034965035
2445708,5,B000BYA4EM,"You just can't beat Children's Television Workshop for creating wonderful, developmentally appropriate products. My 13 month old loves bopping along, and has started to immitate words from the songs. There's lots of repitition and the theme of each segment is consistent across scenes, which means that its unified and cohesive (as opposed to most Baby Einstein DVDS). As usual, the show combines moms, dads and other relatives with all sorts of colors and backgrounds. Plus you will LOVE the songs!",1168905600,,499,5.25
2445709,5,B000BYA4EM,My 13 month old daughter absolutely loves this video.  The songs are also tolerable hearing over and over.  It is very cute!  We utilize the songs in our everyday lives with different situations to help our daughter learn!  Great video the only thing that could improve it would be more of it!,1168300800,,293,4.576923076923077
2445710,5,B000BYA4EM,"This DVD is SO cute! It's, by far, my 2-year old's favorite DVD. Features the sesame street characters as babies and has many cute and catchy songs...You won't regret buying this one! My son prefers Make Music Together over the other two Sesame Beginnings shows (Exploring Together and Beginning Together), but they are all cute and he likes them all. One of the best Sesame Street/Elmo shows around!",1168214400,,400,4.897058823529412
2445711,5,B000BYA4EM,"My 4 month old son loves this video!  He usually sits through a 30 minute video and then gets restless.  With this video he can watch it up to 3 times with no problems.  The songs are easy to learn and fun.  The only thing I don't like about the DVD is that it doesn't loop.  They should add the ""repeat play"" option that other kids DVDs have.",1163721600,,343,3.985294117647059
2445712,5,B000BYA4EM,"We bought sesame beginnings for my 13 month old and Aladen for my 3 year old.  I was disappointed with how short it was at first but they both loved it.  My 3 year old lost all interest in her movie and demanded to watch this one 3 times in a row.  2 months later they both still love it!  My 13 month old, who hardly said a word, immediatly started repeating the words for one of the songs and still loves to call me ma-ma-mommy and babies ba-ba-baby.

It's made to be interactive, so be ready to dance and sing with your kids and add on to the the songs or I'm sure it could get boring but if you get into it so will they.",1159142400,3,624,3.8818897637795278
2445713,2,B000BYA4EM,"This video was very boring compared to the ""Elmo's World"" videos that my son loves. I guess if you are looking for something low key and relaxing for a baby to watch it is a good choice. It is not good for a baby who really loves fun music and action.  My son was 10 months old when I played it and he wasn't interested at all and neither was I. The song choices were dissapointing. It was tedious to sit through, but luckily at only 30 minutes long it was almost over before it started.",1157414400,,487,4.072916666666667
2445714,5,B000BYA4EM,"I bought this for my daughter when it first came out. She's now 7 mon old and she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  I an an early interventionist, so I am very aware of the controversy over whether infants should watch television.  The wonderful thing about this video (unlike videos like Baby Einstein, which my daughter also loves) is that it's designed to be watch with the caregiver, then expanded upon throughout the day.

My entire family loves the songs, they're simple but catchy. In fact, we really do sing the songs throughout the day. She loves when we do ""bump baby bump"" and ""ba-ba-baby""--she always starts ""dancing"".

The dialogue and story are simplistic, yes, but that is because the video is designed for infants.  They have short attention spans and they can't comprehend more detailed videos.  It's their first introduction to a video with a storyline. I just feel it's an excellent first video for children. My daughter watches it once or twice a day by herself (like another reviewer said, it's great to have something entertain her so I can get some work done), but we also watch it with her.

I highly recommend this video (and the first one, which is also good, but I like this one more) for anyone who has an infant or toddler who is going to watch television.  It's a lot of fun for everyone!",1156550400,,1307,4.603448275862069
