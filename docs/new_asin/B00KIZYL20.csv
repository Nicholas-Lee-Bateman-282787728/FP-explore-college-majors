6432861,5,B00KIZYL20,My son watched the entire set within 2 weeks.  He loved it.  When you watch Dateline on TV you immediately know who committed the crime.  They also waste a lot of time introducing you to the characters.  With Forensic files you do not know who did it until deep into the show.  Also there is less character development.  More about what the clues are and trying to figure out who did it.,1420934400,5,387,4.305555555555555
6432862,4,B00KIZYL20,"I love Forensic Files and this set is amazing. I just wish they had included every episode ever made, but I guess this is the next best thing. Would've also been cool if they added some behind the scenes materials showing how they get their stories and how they produce them. But I guess just having 137 episodes is enough.",1416182400,2,323,4.4

6432866,5,B00KIZYL20,"I love watching Forensic Files. I can't begin to explain how much more alert, careful and informed I am about crimes, and crime prevention. I was so excited when I saw that this collection was available for purchase on demand. I didn't waste any time, and had to place my order. If you are a Forensic Files fan, there is nothing that I can say, that you probably already do not know. This show is so informative, that even a criminal could prove themselves guilty or innocent after watching. The detectives, and investigators are well trained, and knowledgeable as well. The DVD's have great sound, and good picture quality. You must get this collection, it will change your life.",1402358400,8,680,4.722689075630252
6432867,5,B00KIZYL20,"If you are a fan of the series like me, this is your set. There was also a set released about 2 years ago, which was excellent and highly recommended. Although far from a complete set, this one and the one before it are the best you will do as far as a dvd release of Forensic Files are concerned. Not sure why entire seasons are not offered, maybe there are just too many episodes.
Nevertheless, both box sets available will keep you occupied for hours, and both have high replay value. Excellent entertainment for fans.",1401840000,14,521,4.4375

6432879,5,B00KIZYL20,"These are not slick productions like ""Dateline"" but they are in depth. At 20 minutes in length they have to be concise so there's no time for fancy segues, long re-enactments or moving video montages. The number of episodes per season varies from season to season from four to 22 (season 11) but the watching goes by quickly. I've found myself watching the same episode two times in a row and they are videos I know I will be watching again in the not too distant future. Although the shows are not graphic (not blatantly so but on occasion real close) the stories are often quite grim. We're talking about murder after all. If you want pure entertainment this is not for you. If you are curious about forensics this is more in depth than anything else on T.V. The information is completely accurate (not that those shows with a forensic element don't try to be true-to-life). The only problem with this collection is there are not enough episodes to suite my desires but since there were 400 episodes produced I guess I will never see them all.",1456444800,,1045,4.5638297872340425
6432880,5,B00KIZYL20,One of my favirote tv shows of all time. Gives evidence of all sorts to take down the bad guys. Explains the scenes in full clear detail as well as consistent great episodes. You cannot fool the evidence of forensics. Great show,1455148800,,228,4.4523809523809526
6432881,5,B00KIZYL20,"Of course the show Forensic Files is excellent, none of the investigations profiled have obvious outcomes and the storytelling is gripping.

The quality of the DVDs generated on-demand by Amazon is incredible.  The packaging is exactly what I would expect with any store bought set of DVDs: each disk has a professional looking label and each case matches what is shown in the photo that accompanies the item description.  On the back of each DVD case is a synopsis of all episodes, except when there are too many to list (some DVD cases cleverly pack several disks), in which case just the episode titles are provided.  The only proof that this is not a factory pressed set of DVDs are the burn circles on the back of the disks.

I bought this set of DVDs nine months ago and waited to write my review after I finished viewing all 137 episodes.  I want to report that there are no quality issues.  Every episode on every disk was playable.

I only wish Amazon offered this on-demand DVD service for all other TV content in their possession instead of providing only a digital download saddled with DRM and limited device support.  But I digress.

One last point -- this item sometimes is unavailable.  If you encounter this situation, just add this item to your wish list and check back in a few weeks.  That is what happened to me.  I hesitated in ordering, then the item was unavailable, but a few weeks later it was back and I pounced.",1454544000,,1439,4.552529182879377
6432882,5,B00KIZYL20,My woman loves this show! She flew through all 139 sode's. I think she needs to spend more time at work. LOL,1453334400,,108,3.9545454545454546
6432883,5,B00KIZYL20,I love this series.,1451347200,,19,4.0
6432884,2,B00KIZYL20,"I give the series itself 5 stars but this release, I'd give 1 star. I can't believe in this day and age, that companies would release a series where it won't play all the episodes one right after another. After each episode is over it goes back to the title menu and will remain there until you select a different episode.",1450396800,4,322,4.295081967213115
6432885,5,B00KIZYL20,"Good series but if you follow the show then there are a few caveats. CNN, HLN, and IDHD which gave the show a new name called Cause of Death on top of episodes on Netflix combine for about 60 or so episodes. These televised episodes are played over and over and over to no end. With this set it is not until season 10 of this disc set that you start to see the same recycled episodes that are on those cable networks and Netflix. So season 1 through 9 are like hidden gems. As another writer said there are no overlap with this box set and episodes with another Forensic Files box set released years earlier. Also there must have been an internal memo sent out to the shows producers regarding the first few seasons because the gore value is pretty high. For example they actually show the picture of an old dead guy who was beat, shot, and stabbed. They show an Alaskan family with children who were raped and murdered in their bedroom, an old lady beat to death by a hotel maintenance man with the pictures of her swollen face up close, and a woman burned in a dumpster to the extent she looked like a curled up bbq possum. Geez! It seems that as the seasons got further down the line they decided not to show as much explicit detail. I'm sure there are a 100 or so episodes floating around in limbo somewhere that are not reruns on TV or cable, or included in any of the two box sets including this one. It would be nice if they were released. Furthermore, this series seem a tad dated like circa 2008 maybe and if they would bring this show back I'm sure they would have tons of material since so much crazy stuff has happened in the news and media all over the world since 2008 that would be ripe for forensic storytelling. Overall its a fantastic show and worth the price along with the earlier box set released prior.",1448668800,,1824,4.27456647398844
6432886,4,B00KIZYL20,"The product arrived safely, though in a much larger box than necessary, requiring more paper padding, which I see as wasteful. I would have been happier had this been a boxed set rather than individual discs, but the content was thoroughly enjoyable and informative.  Overall quite satisfying and interesting.",1440028800,,309,5.3061224489795915
6432887,3,B00KIZYL20,I was disappointed that they were all Best of's and not the complete seasons but it's clearly stated.  Additionally there is no option to play all so you have to choose each episode separately.  Really a pain.  Love the show but not the cd set,1439942400,6,243,4.355555555555555

6432896,5,B00KIZYL20,"Folks thinking about this set should know there are no overlaps with the 96-episode set released earlier. Taken together, the two sets cover 233 of the 400 episodes in the series. Not sure why they are releasing this series in such a haphazard manner. Still, Forensic Files is absolutely the best of the True Crime genre of TV shows. It presents the story from the crime to the resolution, mostly from the perspective of the investigators and the forensic technicians involved. Gripping and very educational.",1423612800,25,508,4.988235294117647
