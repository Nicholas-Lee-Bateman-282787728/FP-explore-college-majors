7585163,3,B019WMTVLA,"I must say I hate when someone is overcritical with kids movies.

In this case though I feel that overcritical is just fair. Kids movies
must have imagination but it needs to be projected in a way that it feels
credible. Some of the plot is not credible and inconsistent, it has some cute moments for sure.
Attitude on the characters well some are adorable (Theodore) and some are just superficial (Britney).
There should always be balanced, right?

About have way through it I began to get desperate, it felt too long, and it was only about 1 1/2 hours.

But at the end the most important this is that my kids liked it. Would they ask to see it again?
probably not.",1324857600,,666,4.3983739837398375

He was absolutely enthralled and it amazingly kept his full attention for the entire movie (at 4 yrs old his attention span is short). Just like the show, it was action and fun packed, with a storyline that had us adults watching too. My mom (67 yrs old) couldn't help but watch too and also enjoyed it.

This was my favorite show when I was little and the Alvin And The Chipmunks Christmas CD was my first CD, haha. Took me back. We thought the cinematography was great and the voice overs were awesome too. When I went into the kitchen for coffee I saw my nephew trying to pet Alvin on our TV screen, lol.

Adorable movie, entertaining to watch, and has some really nice, warm bonding moments too. Smile. Enjoy!",1463788800,5,959,4.406779661016949

I saw part of this movie on TV right before I was going on a business trip, and I had to buy a copy to watch while traveling.  I thought it was bright and funny and made me feel good after watching it, each time I watched it.  For some reason, the television rating for it is one-half star.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  It's not for everyone.  It's not the greatest movie ever made.  If you are cynical and pessimistic, you might not care for it.  Or, it might just make you happier, like it did me (definitely a cynic and a pessimist).  Yes, it makes me happy, so five stars.  I have a big smile on my face just thinking about this movie.  Of the three A & the C movies I've seen (the original, Squeakquel, and Chipwrecked), this is my favorite.  I also loved Jenny Slate as Zoe.  I thought she was hilarious.  However, my favorite character was Simone.  The Chipettes get some good scenes, too.  I'm glad it's not all about Alvin.",1461024000,6,1098,4.197115384615385

7585708,5,B019WMTVLA,"If your kids -- or you -- enjoy innocent and very lighthearted fun, you'll love this movie. My 9-year-old son sure did. The songs range from the pretty-current (ones preteens today would know and love) to previous-generation favorites like the Go-Go's ""Vacation."" David Cross is great again as the villain, Ian, and the rest of the cast does very good work as well.

This is not art. It's not a deathless piece of cinema. Compared to ""Citizen Kane,"" it deserves maybe one-and-a-half stars. But it is not trying to be ""cinema"" -- it's trying to be a zany, ridiculous child-friendly film about talking, singing chipmunks. It succeeds perfectly at that, so I have given it 5 stars for doing just what it set out to do. It's good clean fun that my boy really enjoyed. He laughed out loud at many points during the film, and because he loved it, I loved watching it with him.. If you are looking for something silly and predictable that contains nothing scary or ""inappropriate,"" this is a very solid choice.",1434153600,2,1003,4.666666666666667

7585988,3,B019WMTVLA,"Alvin and the Chipmunks seems to be getting more and more filled with attitude and risque dance routines. I can't quite see where the creators heads are with this. There was one scene where the female chipmunks get into a dissing contest with some women at a club and then start dancing. The scene was so rude and vulgar that I quickly fast forwarded it and then watched it carefully to ensure nothing else popped up that I could not imagine my little toddlers watching. This isn't something I would have done with Alvin and the Chipmunks former movies. I don't think I started having difficulties with it until they introduced the females chipmunks. Overall, I'd say rent an earlier movie without the female chipmunks in it.",1405209600,3,725,4.716535433070866

7586147,1,B019WMTVLA,"I have never had a 400 pound man full on cheap Mexican food diarrhea in my mouth, but if I did I would have to imagine that the experience would be very similar to watching Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. For starters the character development of alvin was underscored by the large cocaine use of Dave. The motifs of death and the prospects of the inevitable death that we all face illustrated by dave's addiction and eventual suicide overshadowed the playfulness of the children's movie. If Edison knew that this movie would eventually exist, he would have stopped invented the technology to create motion picture and promptly bashed his head is with a blunt object till blood no longer flowed to his brain. ""Sacre bleu' "" Semone's French accent was below par and she slaughtered all of her verb conjugations. Crap, my friends, crap is the only word in the english lexicon that approaches the appropriate descriptor of this so called film. Please, I ask you, no I beg and beseech to destroy any copies of this movie immediately. It is absolutely imperative.

I have set up a hotline for those who are recovering from the tragedy of watching this movie. Please call:

If you love Alvin and the chipmunks, you'll love this 3rd DVD Chipwrecked. Though there may be some scary parts in it for the little ones, older kids (about age 7 plus) would find it exciting.  Obviously parents use your judgement. The movie uses many similar phases as the 1st 2 movies, which will seem boring to most adults, but kids love that repetition. Hope this helps!

7586306,5,B019WMTVLA,My grandchildren love to watch Alvin movies when they come to visit. I was delighted to add this one to my collection.,1354406400,,118,4.409090909090909
7586307,5,B019WMTVLA,"Alvin & the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked is really good.  You know, I'm surprised just how good it is.  As a kid of the 80's I loved the cartoon.  I loved the mischievous adventures that Alvin would get into.  I loved the way he'd always get under Dave's skin.  I loved the renditions of popular 80's songs such as the Cars ""Shake It Up"" and Madonna's ""Material Girl"", but these current movies are probably even better.  They step up the excitement level a few more notches.

This one is about Alvin and the gang getting stuck on a desert island after floating away on a kite.  Dave and their crooked manager from the previous films makes a return, and he's actually fairly tame, friendly, reasonable and likeable this time around.  The female chipmunks return as well.  Perhaps the only complaint I have (besides all the cheesy singing and dancing) is the constant need for the chipmunks to sing current music from the likes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.  These songs won't last over the long term and therefore won't be remembered several years from now.  The writers should stick with the classics instead.

Anyway, when the chipmunks have to fend for themselves on a deserted island, this is when all chaos breaks loose.  They meet a woman who's been there for 7-8 years and well, she's mentally unstable and clearly lost her marbles!  She's there because she's on a quest for gold.  Meanwhile the chipmunks just want to be rescued.  They worry that Dave might not be coming, but... will he?  You'll have to watch it to find out!

Overall, pretty solid jokes (though a little more childish this time around) and great storytelling and entertainment for the entire family guaranteed (if you're a chipmunks fan, that is).  Perhaps the relationship between Alvin and Dave is more sentimental than usual as well.  Isn't Theodore just adorable?  Yes!  And the heroics of Simon as a result of a spider bite?  You'll understand what this means when you watch the film, haha.",1354320000,,1967,4.734513274336283
7586308,5,B019WMTVLA,Needed a light funny movie with a bit of attitude and this movie delivers. Loaded with laughter and touching moments. Thoroughly enjoyed,1354147200,,136,5.2272727272727275
7586309,5,B019WMTVLA,"My daughter loves her chipmunks. My wife and I hate hearing the same movie over and over and over. So we got Chipwrecked for her to watch and to give ourselves a break. This one is pretty good. Different from the other 2. This version also has a sing along. And having some thing else to let her dance, play and sing along is great, being able to accomplish things at home is invaluable. She likes this one better then either of the other 2. And we like something new to hear instead of the same thing.",1353801600,,502,4.185567010309279
7586310,5,B019WMTVLA,"Let me start out by saying, I cannot stand the chipmunks.

BUT, this is actually the only movie out of the 3 that I can stand. My daughter and I can watch it numerous amounts of times and it keeps both our interests.",1353715200,,216,4.023255813953488
7586311,2,B019WMTVLA,"I finally was able to see this third installment of one of my most beloved childhood characters and after what I thought were two fun and enjoyable films and I excited to see the new one. At this point I was expected no more character introductions and just a great Chipmunk story. Unfortunately I was not to happy with what I got.

'Chipwrekced', was nothing but a simple no effort film that ties up all the lose ends that the predecessors left behind. Also, it was an attempt to place stupid pop culture references all through-out the movie. Of course I will admit there were some very cute moments and jokes. Even more so a little bit of character development, but a very small amount. The music of course is always a Chipmunk staple, but it this film the flow of the songs was just very unorganized and a little over done.

At this point I think it is safe to say that this franchise is history, it was nice to have a brief moment of Chipmunk-Mania, especially since these characters have been in the public eye since the late 1950's. Still, if you want to have a proper send off, you gotta give it some effort. Will there be a 4th film...if there is I would not be shocked, even if it was just a made for video release. Will I see it...unless they fix what they broke, definitely not...I'm munked out for now.",1353715200,,1314,4.359183673469388

The Chipmunk movies fall into that category. The singing is the key. Too much talking and anyone is going to lose interest. I have only one complaint about Chipwreaked. The female cast away is very annoying. She's not funny. In fact she's irritating for any age group. Otherwise great fun - let's have another!,1351382400,,465,4.614457831325301

Full of witty humor to keep parents from slipping into ""kiddie tv"" comas.  It's sweet and innocent and shouldn't offend most conservative families, though it does have a gambling scene on a cruise and a girl dance-off scene that are both a little odd, but in my estimation harmless enough.

7586405,4,B019WMTVLA,"""Chipwrecked"" is much the best of the three recent chipmunk movies.  It is imaginative, mischievous, well plotted, and thankfully devoid of so much of the ""bad guy"" emphasis in the other two.
 In this story, everyone (yes, even nasty Ian) must pull together for survival when they are stranded on an island. The scenes on the cruise boat are hilarious as Alvin wreaks havoc, Brittany emotes, and Theodore is adorably terrified watching a ""scary"" DVD -- don't worry, it doesn't even scare our just-three-year-old granddaughter, so no problem there, and it teaches the lesson that adults should pick the movies their kids watch.
 On the island all kinds of exciting and funny things happen. Simon becomes Rambo-esque ""Seemone,"" and the gang discovers a castaway. I am 69 and I love this movie, and so do my 3 -year- old granddaughter, my 10-year-old granddaughter, and my six-year-old grandson.  We laugh ourselves silly and we have seen it several times!
 Highly recommended for kids and for adults who are not afraid to laugh at something truly and innocently funny!",1336089600,,1066,5.0

7586414,3,B019WMTVLA,"Just watched this and was very disappointed in it. It was nothing like the first 2. For the first 20 minutes it seemed like the movie had been sponsored by a cruise line company, showing the fancy amenities a cruise ship has to offer with the chipmunks running through the scenes here and there not saying much. Then they fall off the ship along with Dave & Ian (yes he's back, and good thing! He brings the comedy to this one!) and get stranded on an island. They seem to copy parts from other movies in this, such as finding someone stranded on the island who talks to basketballs & golf balls (sound familiar...Wilson) and when Jenette is being lowered into a cave to bring up gold for her kidnapper (just like Disney's The Rescuers- the 1st one). For adults watching, the only good thing about this one was the song choices, Lady Gaga, Rihanna etc sung by the chipmunks throughout which all sounded great, especially S.O.S sung by Jenette in the cave & the end songs performed by all 6 chipmunks on stage. Very basic movie for young kids...lots of singing but not much going on in it. Seemed like they were on a tight budget for this one unfortunately. It was the quality of a ""straight to DVD"" movie.",1335830400,,1205,4.457013574660634

7586421,4,B019WMTVLA,"Where the first Chipmunks movie was cute, I never really saw it as a multi-film franchise. Lo and behold, we're already at film three. Overall, Chipwrecked shows that there's still some life to the franchise, although probably not enough for a fourth movie. On the one hand, the Chipmunks themselves were as funny as ever. We actually see the characters develop and begin to poke fun at their stereotypes. I particularly loved how Simon went ""nuts"" and transformed into a French Rambo. The flirtation between Simon and Jeannette was adorable.

The human actors did disappoint. Dave is Dave and was fine for the most part. Ian returns wearing a funny pelican suit. Still, I feel like the writers didn't really squeeze out all of the humor they could have gotten out of that character (although his speech near the end was classic). The big disappointment was Zoey, Zoey is a new character, a castaway stuck on the island where the Chipmunks land. Aside from a few funny references to Tom Hanks' movie Cast Away - including sports balls with eyes and mouths - her character just doesn't add a whole lot to the movie. She seems awkward and out of place at times. At times, I kept wishing she would go away so the camera could focus on the Chipmunks. Fortunately, despite my complaints, she's actually not in too much of the movie, but it still would have been better to either make her do something important, make her funny, or make her go away.

Ultimately, I'm glad we got Chipmunks 3. If there's another one, I think it'll really have to focus on the Chipmunks and their humor, and leave the humans out of it.",1335398400,,1610,4.625874125874126

But you know the movie is for the people in all age. So the producers must square up all the people in defferent age. I know people in our age(I mean the age over 18)may perfer the movie with ups and downs points and thrilling secse like ""Mission Impossible"" but how about the kids?Can you image a kid in 0-10 yeas watching ""Mission Impossible"" and say this is great?(Perhaps there will be but I'm sure it's only a few.)And on the other hand I have to say this movie has an amazing technology and the six chipmunks were created very very cutely. At the same time I think they are much cuter then them in the cartoon.(It's just my opinion.)Perhaps you guys can image how difficult the producers pruduce the chipmunks' movie. So I think we should treat the movie in different way and we should give it negative feedback. Don't you think so?Let's respect the behind-the-scenes staff together.

7586463,4,B019WMTVLA,"Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor all become marooned on a desert island when another of Alvin's wild schemes goes awry, this time while on a vacation cruise to an international music awards show overseas. In an attempt to rescue them, Dave soon gets stranded too, and even evil ""Uncle"" Ian is along for the adventure. Meanwhile, the `munks are not in the best of hands, as they have fallen into a friendship of sorts with another castaway, a woman named Zoe who is clearly not all there and definitely not concerned with anyone's safety.

This third installment in the Chipmunks' bigscreen/live-action franchise was yet another huge hit, and that probably means those of us who enjoy the Chipmunks can look forward to another film down the pipeline (hopefully keeping Jason Lee and keeping to the bigscreen. However, this one has been hit pretty hard in the reviews department. People generally didn't like it and consider it a cheap, contrived cash grab. But, ya know what? A LOT of those people seem to say that about any live-action film with CGI cartoon stars, even without ever seeing the movie. It's a kinda prejudice that exists these days against certain kinds of movies, especially ones with the younger audience as priority. Yes, they are all cash grabs; that doesn't mean they can't be good films. And, you've also got tons of people out there who could never find this sort of thing entertaining because their brains are too ""old"". They see this as just a movie to take their kids to, and something they have to suffer through. They would never ALLOW themselves to enjoy it. So, all I'm saying is, be careful whose advice you take about ANY movie's worth. See it yourself, and if you know you're not going to like it because it is a Chipmunks movie or a live-action cartoon, or whatever else, before you even see the film, then even if you do see it, you might as well keep your opinion to yourself. Just because they are not your genre does not mean they are all garbage.

So, speaking to those who were open minded about the first film (which was a very good film, and any negatives I've heard on it came from people like I've described above or that breed of fan who thinks the 80's version of the Chipmunks IS and SHOULD ALWAYS BE the only way they are ever done), longtime Chipmunk fans like myself or not, this movie is NOT as bad as everyone has said. It's not as good as the first one, but I'd say it is as good as the second, and at least we don't get a replacement Dave here for the bulk of the film. Now, this film IS more pandering to the kid audience, as the second one was (this one might be worse in that department), and there are a few cringe-worthy moments of over-the-top silliness, like with the second film, which usually has to do with how some humans interact with the chipmunks. In this film, I was not crazy about the skanky club-girl dance off the Chipettes had early on. And, no doubt, a lot of people probably found the Zoe character a bit annoying. I think that she was supposed to be a little bit, but comedic personalities like her are often annoying to many people. She was still pretty funny. And the main characters, Dave, the Chipmunks, the Chipettes, and Ian were back in perfect form. If you're someone who watches this movie more for the Chipmunks than anything else, I'd take a guess that they get most of the screen time this go-round. But, like I said, we thankfully see a lot more of Dave, which the second film lacked.

Anyway, as for the story, yeah, it's pretty simple, and of course it's contrived. That's the nature of cartoon character stories, especially those largely rooted in the world of television. The entertainment comes from the characters, how they handle things, how they interact with others, etc... It's about personalities, and these characters are the same as they ever were. Not surprising, since the same folks who created the 80's TV series are strong forces behind these newer films (so, don't give me the ""it's nothing like the 80's Chipmunks"" routine, your hindsight is rose-colored). But, as usual, there are lessons to be learned here all around, and they are well done. It's a film about learning to be responsible when necessary, and parents learning to trust their kids when necessary (and that they've managed to teach them a thing or two), and even about learning to forgive and be a better person. Yeah, those are just a few lessons you can pull from this film, but it IS well done.

And, oh, did you know there's music in this too? Yeah, the Chipmunks sing a lot in this. Though, I think for some people this was still a weak point since the songs are mostly current (or recent), and not everyone keeps up with that stuff. I've heard some folks say they only recognized the first song in the film (""Vacation""), but I am sure that's not really true. Surely they recognize the Lady Gaga songs too, at the very least. Anyway, this was not a big issue for me, but I suppose a lot of the oldschool fans would like to see a few more oldschool tunes in any future installments.

""Alvin and the Chipmunks - Chipwrecked"" is technically consistent with the 2 previous films. The visuals are highest quality, the characters are the same as we remember, and the story may be contrived for some, but as a chipmunks story it is fitting enough and makes way for the personality-driven entertainment, as a good, comedic cartoon plot should. Many will complain about the pop culture humor, especially the kind that panders to the youngest or that which some folks find tacky, but the Chipmunks are the very definition of pop-culture exploitation, let's face it. It's what they do. If you don't like it, watch something else. For the few moments of jokes that might leave older viewers clueless, most of the rest of the film is pretty universally understandable and entertaining, especially if you have been a fan of these characters for a looong time. Bottom-line, this is a fine Chipmunks movie. It's not as good as the first in this series, but that one focused the most on entertaining the oldschool fans. The sequels, yes, HAVE pandered more to the younger set (though at least they brought in the Chipmunks for us), but there is still plenty of fun and funny here, as well as consistency with the previous two films, that anyone who liked the other two should be able to enjoy this one too. It may be your least favorite, maybe not, but it's worthwhile if the Chipmunks are your thing, and if that isn't ONLY the 80's Chipmunks. Hey, I grew up with them too, I just think a lot of my fellow fans have that version on a pedestal. I think that's more the fault of the 80's bigscreen feature than the actual TV show, ha. Anyway, I do recommend this to those who saw the previous two. If you didn't, then why are you even here?

Now, a word about the Blu-Ray release. This Blu-Ray comes with a DVD and a digital copy. I don't use digital copies, so I won't talk about that. I think the DVD's are a nice inclusion, though if I'm paying more to get it, I'd rather just have the Blu-Ray and keep the price down. Anyway, there is a nice selection of behind the scenes featurettes here that talk a lot about the Chipmunks, the Bagdasarians (the family behind the Chipmunks), the film, and everything else. There is unfortunately no commentary, but we do get extended scenes and a lot of options for singing and dancing along to the songs. The trailers are also included, as well as a short Scrat cartoon (from ""Ice Age"") and a trailer for ""Mirror, Mirror"", which you may be glad to know if you, like me, consider Lily Collins (Phil's daughter) to be an absolute goddess (even if the movie and her enhanced eyebrows look over-the-top silly). But, I digress. ""Chipwrecked"" naturally looks fantastic on Blu-Ray, so if you can't get enough of the Chipmunks and those adorable Chipettes, yeah, you'll wanna pick this one up.",1333411200,,7911,4.5715292459478505
7586464,2,B019WMTVLA,"I think this latest movie starring the adorable Alvin & The Chipmunks was horrendous. I'm no stranger to corny movies but Chipwrecked was almost unbearable. In the first 10 minutes I was wanting to turn it off, but Jordan (my 3 year old) was insisting on watching it.

It's always cute seeing chipmunks strut around dancing and singing popular songs, but the acting from Jason Lee (My Name is Earl) was killing me! I mean, I know it's probably not easy acting alone since the chipmunks are added later, but come on...

That being said, I might be a little harsh when it comes to reviewing movies like this. While I literally despised this movie, my son Jordan loved it! He has his DVD player on repeat and hasn't watched anything but Chipwrecked since Friday. He's even running around the house constantly saying the funniest part of the movie, where Alvin slams into a tree and says in a strained voice, ""Oh, my acorns...""

She makes Jeanette go into a cabe to get the treasure and won't let her come up till it's found, and this was so much like ""The Rescuers"" that I laughed.

This is my least favorite Chipmunk movie but is still all right and worth watching.  I do like the emphasis on teamwork and the way Alvin learns not to be a brat.",1333238400,2,536,4.076190476190476
7586466,4,B019WMTVLA,"I used to love the chipmunks when I was little (in the 80s) and the Chipmunk Adventure animated movie as well.  I have two girls (5 and 7) that I have shared these with, and they loved the Chipmunk Adventure movie especially.  So it seemed natural to check this out when it hit Blu-Ray, with a little apprehension.  The last few CGI/live action mixed movies we have seen were just kind of ""okay"" at best (""Hop"" and ""The Smurfs""), however this is MUCH better than both of those films put together.  It's a kids movie at heart, don't get that wrong, but there's plenty of pop culture and internet culture references thrown in for good measure.  Theodore exclaiming over a double rainbow (""what does it mean?"") and great chunks from the movie Castaway.  The music is poppy and entertaining and Alvin is up to his old tricks as usual (it wouldn't be a Chipmunk movie without him getting into trouble!) Jason Lee makes a good Dave, and has definitely got the ""ALVIIIIN"" yell down pat by now.

The story is predictable but not overly so, and has enough action and laughs to keep it flowing.  The movie never really bogs down, which is a good thing, and keeps at a nice pace, despite falling back on an overused shipwrecked type setting.  It's cute, inoffensive fluff that the kids will adore and the parents will tolerate.  Mine laughed through the whole movie, and yours probably will too.",1333152000,,1384,4.5894308943089435
7586467,1,B019WMTVLA,"The Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise isn't exactly held up as a paragon of contemporary cinema, but even for its low standards, its latest installment, Chipwrecked, failed on pretty much every level. In this third animated/live-action romp, the titular trio and their female counterparts are stranded on a deserted island when a parasailing mishap leads them astray; caretaker Dave and his old boss Ian work together to locate and rescue their furry friends. I found the film forgettable, with recycled humor and lazy writing that made for an obnoxious and unfunny moviegoing experience. But, as with so many movies of this nature, I must keep in mind that I am not the target audience here, and must concede that if you're just looking for something mindless to keep your very young children at bay for a couple of hours, this might do the trick.",1332806400,4,848,4.895833333333333

I love any & all Chipmunk movies - especially since I'm pretty sure I own all of them (& I don't mean just the 3 newest ones). I've been a fan of theirs since I was a year old - so for 27yrs now I've loved these guys.

I loved this movie, because there's a whole lot of Simon in it & he's my favourite by far. I love Alvin & Theodore too, but Simon is my Chipmunk. I like Jeanette having a bigger part as well - always liked her since she got Simon & kind of reminds me of me sometimes.

I could've done without the 'Castaway' part of it - that chick with the balls as friends was pointless to me. And my biggest issue with this movie - why do the Chipettes sing on every song??? The Chipmunks don't have a single song to themselves & the movie is ""Alvin & The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked"" NOT ""The Chipettes Movie"". It angers me a little that it feels like the Chipettes are slowly taking over. Yeah, I like them well enough, but c'mon. There's no reason for them to sing on every song & have songs to themselves, when The Chipmunks only get shared songs. The Chipmunks deserve to have plenty of songs to themselves, since they ARE the true stars & not the Chipettes. And some of the song choices....I get they're trying to keep with the times, but couldn't they throw in a couple 90's songs or 60's songs for us older fans? We're not all fans of Katy Perry & Lady Gaga here.

I gave this movie a 5 though, because despite my frustration above, I love Simon getting lot of attention. I also loved Alvin's role in it all - I felt awful for him, when he thought Dave didn't love him enough to look for him. I like that they showed his sensitive side.

I would reccommend this movie to anyone, since I'm a die-hard fan of The Chipmunks.",1332720000,,1755,4.165191740412979
7586469,4,B019WMTVLA,"The 411 by Maria, Handsome and Goddess:

We were able to watch this on Wednesday which happened to be a day off due to teacher conferences or some jazz. We loved the last chipmunk movie so we had high expectations for this one.  Personally, I wasn't sure that they would be able to carry on the franchise in a way that was interesting and fresh man was I wrong. We sang through the whole movie. It is a really cute story. Goddess was in love with all the music. She has a favorite chipmunk and stated so through the whole movie. Handsome liked anytime Dave and Ian were on screen. He thinks the Chipmunks former manger is hysterical especially in the pelican suit.

In Chipwrecked, Dave takes the Chipmunks and the Chippettes on a cruise. Alvin of course ends up getting them all grounded while Dave heads to dinner to talk with the captain. Poor little Theodore ends up watching TV that is way too scary for him. My kids thought it was so cute how he couldn't just change the channel and sat there mesmerized at the creepy images before his eyes. They do the same if they wake in the middle of the night to see us watching something on Sci-Fi.

When everyone ends up overboard the chipmunks must work together to survive on an island, and yes, they do sing ""I'm a survivor"". The songs are some of the best parts of the movie!

If you have chipmunk fans in the house, you can't go wrong with this family friendly movie. Yes, I have seen some reviews were people talk about the ""suggestive"" dance moves of the Chippettes but I was watching the same stuff on the Bugs Bunny Show and Tom and Jerry too. Nothing different! I didn't see it as sexy than, and I don't see it as sexy now. Just a good family friendly movie!",1332720000,,1715,4.330218068535825

7586471,5,B019WMTVLA,"I think some parents are looking into this waaayyy too much! It is a cartoon and although it is obviously for those with an imagination, it is not meant to be a learning experience. My husband and I took my daughter to see this when it came out. I found it very cute, it kept even our attention and my daughter loved it. My daughter loves to dance around the house and sing songs she magically comes up with, and this cartoon had plenty of that! I think the rating was fine. So what if the chipettes put on salsa dresses and competed with human dancers? I didn't think it was provocative and honestly my daughter has more than likely seen worse dressed people out in public. You can't take your kids around blind folded. My daughter didn't go home looking for a short dress or walk around ""shaking her booty."" Come on people. I take my daughter to church every Sunday and live by the book so we are probably a little more strict than some parents, but these reviews are insane!! There were no curse words, no adult content, and no nudity. I see no problem here! There is not even anything remotely teaching bad habits here (except for maybe Alvin's behavior). Even in the Shrek movies Shrek burps and doesn't say excuse me, but no one commented on that! I tought my daughter manners before I taught her anything else so this bothered me (although very little). I still let her watch every one of those that came out! So in my opinion, this was an excellent movie and I will be buying the DVD for my daughter the day it comes out.",1332374400,,1529,4.34965034965035
7586492,5,B019WMTVLA,"This Movie is awesome I love seeing the chipmunks one of my favorite films of all time. They should keep making them I will see all of them.  I'm proud to say I'm 24 years old and I will go to a chipmunk film any day.  I get really offended when I see that this is for small children.  What about the people who grew up with them huh.  Tough guy's I see that's what it is.  They don't want to loose their dignity or is it shameful to like a children's film.  Well who ever said it was a children's film.  It's all those rated R films that gets you all ""eww"" I don't like this.  Well I'm the kind of person that it don't matter what anyone says to me.

I love these kind of films.  I love animated and voice over characters.  Above all my favorite chipmunk is Simon.  So cute.  then it goes Alvin.  You people that do the voice overs are awesome for continuing to do so.  Matthew Grey Gubbler, Jesse McCartney, Justin Long, Amy Poehler, Anna Faris, and Christina Applegate.  You guys also with the chipmunk voices are amazing singers.  I love the harmonizing parts and the solos.  It's incredible.  Rather your good singers or not the finish product is ""Flawless"".  By the way this is the first review I have ever written and I'm proud to do it for the Chipmunks.  I will watch this film over and over.  So funny, great singing, great songs, great acting, great story line, and way to keep of their unique personalities.  Alvin the awesome one, Simon the Smart one, Theodore the adorable one, Britney the Pretty one, Janette the not so sure one, Ellenore the clumsy one.

Keep up the great work and bring me more songs on discs I collect them all and Listen to them all the time.  I also have all the films.  They get better and better.  Thanks for the Chipmunk fun.  Great fan.  Thomas Searle  (A future actor) working on it.",1330214400,43,1825,4.2823529411764705

I used to love Alvin in The Chipmunks as a kid, now, when I saw the film installments I was mortified and wanted to cry in tears. Goofy empty gesture is all that remains in my mind when I think about the films. not a pleasant sight and if you want your kids to recall fond memories, check out the 1980's cartoon series.

Story was stripped none and was just a bunch of terrible movie ripp-offs butchering any possible enlightenment. Nothing in this film is original or even creative at all!

The plot flows smoothly, the characters are great, the actors are great, the whole damn thing is great! I actually cried at a part of this film. I will not tell you what part because that will spoil the whole movie! I will for sure buy this combo pack because I believe that this movie is worth seeing over and over again! If you have younger kids they will enjoy this movie because it is the only film out of all three films that is rated G. There are a few suggestive remarks that will probably go over your kids heads.

7586498,4,B019WMTVLA,"There are a lot of harsh words being said here and elsewhere about this movie, so I thought I'd put in my two cents worth. When viewing a movie like this, that is obviously made for young children please keep in mind it is primarily for their entertainment.  Most adults aren't going to find it terribly exciting.
I took my son to see it, and while it would not have been my first choice of movie, he loved it, and his enjoyment made it fun for me as well.  If you have a child who already loves the Chipmunks, this will probaby be right up their alley.  Lots of upbeat, chirpy songs, plenty of action.  Alvin is his usual mischevious self, though in the course of the story he does find that he can be the responsible one when he needs to be.  Silly jokes and humor, certainly.  Some warm fuzzy moments as well (no pun intended).  Have a Chipmunk fan in your house?  It's worth seeing.  My son can't wait to get his own dvd copy.",1326240000,110,930,4.209039548022599
