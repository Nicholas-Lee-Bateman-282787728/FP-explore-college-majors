8745501,5,B00AAP02TO,"The Part 1 and 2 dvds on creating a trading plan are really good. I was introduced to Ron Wagner many years ago when I started my trading education with Pristine. Ron presents material very well and has an easy to understand format even for the novice traders. Over the years I think I have collected all of Pristine's dvds. I have collected them to use for great reviews on the stock market and how to be the very best full-time trader I can be. Thanks Mr Wagner for great instructions on how to create a personal trading and investing plan.

Sincerely,
Keith Brinegar",1483488000,,569,4.471153846153846
