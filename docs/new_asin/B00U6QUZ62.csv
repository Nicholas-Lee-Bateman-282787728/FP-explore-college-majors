8704523,3,B00U6QUZ62,"This movie kept popping up during my Amazon searches as one of those ' OTHER films you might be interested in'. For a long while I was sorta 'put-off' by the title: ""Eva Braun"" (Hitler's mistress) 'cause I wasn't really interested in HER - BUT - then I finally  read the little 'editorial blurb' about its' content and it actually sounded intriguing.  This filmic ""Eva Braun"" really has NOTHING to do with Hitler's honey - rather it was touted as some sort of a 'satirical'(??)  riff on the decadent doings of (X) Italian Prime Minister Claudio Berlasconi.  It sounded a little like it might have some similarities to Passolini's infamous film ""Salo"" - which also featured rich aristocrats sexually debasing young people (in Italy!) - so I decided to give it a watch.

Having now viewed it - my reaction was less than enthusiastic.  The story (of a rich guy (Pier) who promises to help a variety of struggling individuals to achieve their professional dreams - IF - they cater to his weird sexual trips) is put forward in such a scattered way that it is very difficult to 'get' what's going on, who is who, and to 'care' about ANY of the participants.  There is an attempt to provide 'involving' back-stories to most of the participants - who are all basically needing money - but none of them really seems to grab you.  'Pier' is aided in his debaucheries by a faithful chauffeur and an X lover 'Romy' - who have a lot of close-ups staring enigmatically into the camera, but they never really 'do' anything.  All of the sad people who are Pier's sexual pawns go thru some sort of lack-luster erotic games at his bidding (the strangest being a girl who jerks off a dead pooch!) and there's some implied 'nastiness/sadism' but little is 'shown'.  Naked females (and males) ARE provided - but their actions produce zero arousal in anyone... in the end analysis itz all pretty pointless and when the film ended my reaction was sorta: ""HUH! - THAT'S IT"" ?!?
As for ""Eva Braun"" - she's the cute young daughter of 'Pier' who is shown being carried around by Romy in several inexplicable scenes that have no apparent relation to anything else in the plot and she is 'revealed' in the last moments of the film as if her 'name' is some big deal - but for the life of me I couldn't see any connection to anything in the quagmire of a movie I had just watched.

Maybe the folks in Italy got something outta this piece of meandering metaphor - but for me - something was definitely 'lost in the translation'.  Perhaps worth a look for the attractive naked girls that put in a brief appearance - but more of a 'renter' than a 'keeper' in my humble opinion.
Nice widescreen color picture - Italian language w/ English subs - no extras.",1453766400,6,2721,4.541922290388548

By doing this, this guy will give them advice to succeed in whatever they are going after in life.  The story is just too weird and you don't give a crap about any of these characters.  I got the feeling that this movie tries to be a PG-13 Salo...lol.  But, hey...give it a go if you like weird foreign movies.",1444003200,3,454,4.125
