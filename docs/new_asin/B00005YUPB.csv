1680318,4,B00005YUPB,"""Longshot"" is a great movie....if you're a thirteen year old girl who loves *NSYNC.  The plot is really dumb, but the celeb cameos provide a lot of comedy.  The sappy love story is somewhar interguing, but only fot teenagers and pre-teens.  However, if you're a fan of a celeb that's in this movie (especially O-Town or Chris Kirkpatrick who are easily the funniest) it's worth buying if you can find it...less expensive.",1015113600,4,421,4.819444444444445
1680339,1,B00005YUPB,"and when i finally found it, it sucked! i expected it to be sumwhat stupid silly but it ended up being one of the worst movies ever. the whole story line doesnt even fully make sense. i think this was pearlmans idea to make big bucks off all the boy bands. if u like boy bands (like i do) ur prolly better off with the soundtrack, not the movie. the lines are cheesy, the main characters have no acting backgrounds...jus good looks, which is really pathetic. i paid 7 bucks for this movie and im feeling ripped off already. pretty sad.",1136592000,,535,4.306930693069307
1680340,5,B00005YUPB,"I loved this movie SOOOO much, its great.. :). It has an even balance and puts people in there you wouldnt expect (ex: Britney Spears as a flight attendant). Its one of those movies that if ur not looking for a minute, u could miss something :). Great storyline too with Lazlo and everything, great great movie- one of my favorites. And, to all BSB fans out there- Howie D.'s sister- Pollyanna is in it *she's a waitress, answers the little girl's question about when the pizza will be ready.* Has something for everyone in it.",1097193600,,527,4.5

1680342,4,B00005YUPB,I caught this when it was a half hour into it on HBO and i thought it was funny. I'm not a big fan of some of the groups/people that made cameos. if you like them and cheesy movies then u might want to buy this.,1062288000,2,211,3.608695652173913
1680343,1,B00005YUPB,"This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  I am a fan of N Sync and Britney, so I decided to rent this movie.  Good thing I got it as a free rental, because it is not really worth the 4.00 it costs to rent it!  It was obviously just made to advertise and market Lou Perlman's groups (N Sync,Innosense, LFO, Take 5, and C-Note).  The main character, Alex, worked in a music store, so everywhere you look, there were N Sync, C-Note, and Take 5 CDs and videos.  And I should have known that obviously a movie must not be that great if it has to catch people's attention by listing the cameos instead of listing what the movie is about on the back of the box. The story does not flow together well at all; it was like a bunch of different scenarios pieced together. If you're still curious about this movie, then I suggest that you rent it because it's definitely not worth it to pay the full price to own it.  I wouldn't even recommend this movie to big N Sync, O-Town, or LFO fans.",1033689600,3,1008,4.143589743589744

1680345,5,B00005YUPB,I may be the only one but I like this movie. I thought it was hilarious. To some of you it may be a no brainer but I really enjoyed this. Beside for the fact that I am an *Nsync fanatic I like the story line and the way it was executed throughout the movie. I think the cameo's made it more comical and added to the whole movie. If you like silly humor then you would enjoy this. I RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY!!!,1032307200,2,406,3.9036144578313254
1680346,4,B00005YUPB,"If you love (like me!) all those up and coming pop stars such as
Innocense, Take 5 and others, as well as the already pop superstars NSYNC, O-Town, LFO and Britney Spears... you'll LOVE this movie! It has guest appearances from everybody including some such as Kenny Rogers, Howie D's sister Pollyana, Kevin Eubanks (The Tonight Show) and so many more! The plot may be a repeat of the typical cheesy teen movie, but with so much great talent and music, you can't go wrong! This is a MUST HAVE for any hard core pop fan! (and while you're at it, get the soundtrack too!)",1027900800,3,569,4.428571428571429
1680347,1,B00005YUPB,"Yes ladies and gentlemen, it is that bad.  I would much rather have been subjected to repeated viewings of ""Exit Wounds"" than one session of ""Longshot"".  Unfortunately, I was bored enough to actually watch this the whole way through at a friends, god help me.  If you have been suckered into actually buying this on DVD you've wasted your money.  Okay, maybe if your a big Nsync fan or whatever and you feel it's necessary then enjoy.  But to even try to tell me ""Longshot"" was the least bit good would send me into a rage.
I'm not even going to sum up the plot for you, because you'd be better off not knowing it.  I cringed when Lance Bass actually turns to the camera and says ""They need to get NSYNC"", dear god, who created this movie and why?  With cameos by such talented (yeah right) Pop stars such as O-Town, Nsync and Brittney Spears, how can you lose (that was sarcasm folks).  But wait it gets better, your subjected to countless appearances by Gilbert Godfrey screaming his lungs out, boy that just made my day.
But like I mentioned, if your a big Pop fan, I guess you should get this, dear god did I just say that?  Seriously though, if your curiousity is leading you towards this movie, lead it in another direction.  Oh, and another side note, I have never in my life seen so many blatant product placements in one sitting.  Well, my ranting is done, and for whoever had the idea to make this movie, do the world a favor and don't make a sequel.",1025222400,4,1460,4.350553505535055
1680348,1,B00005YUPB,"Longshot appears to be Pop producer has-been Lou Pearlman's last attempt at squeezing money out of the successful music artists/groups that dumped him and his money-hoarding methods.  The movie boasts starring roles by artists such as *NSYNC and Britney Spears when in actuality, they appear on screen for no longer than a few moments.
This movie has been in the making for nearly 3 years (the *NSYNC cameos date back to 1999), and unfortunately, absolutely nothing is shown for the work.  This movie has a cheesy, predictable plot with no entertainment value whatsoever.  Its sole existence is to extract a couple more dollars from Lou Pearlman's almost broken strings attached to the many pop stars who left him(Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, O-Town, LFO, etc.) and to promote the sad little pop groups that he's put together to attempt to take their place in his wallet(Innosense, Take-5, etc.).
*SIDE NOTE: Take-5 has since succeeded in dissolving their contract with Lou Pearlman because of his mistreatment of the band (considering they're all minors) and corrupt handling of their funds.....funny how *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys sued for the same things*
Don't waste your time on this one.  If you're into predictable plots with popstar cameos, go buy On The Line instead.  At least that one's worth your time.",1017360000,5,1310,5.102803738317757
7957347,5,B00005YUPB,I love cheesy movies and this one literally takes the cake lol,1465171200,,62,4.25
7957348,2,B00005YUPB,The picture looks like you're looking through  an hour glass. The corners of the screen on both sides stretches out the picture. NOT GOOD QUALITY.,1460073600,,146,4.84
7957349,1,B00005YUPB,"This film is beyond terrible. I'd rather watch embarrassing and awkward home movies from the 80s. It's poorly filmed, acted, costumed, every scene is cliche and obvious. You know exactly what's going to happen next and what they are going to say. Lou Pearlman is an even bigger loseur thinking that this was a good idea. It's obvious how fame and money hungry he was. I was an obnoxious fan of *NSYNC and I had never heard of this film (im in the US so no surprise there!) so when I heard they were in this I was mad I hadnt heard about it than I looked online for clips. I saw all their scenes. If I knew that was it I would of stuck with the video I saw online. The rest of the film is so corny. I actually feel bad for them and Dwayne Johnson who actually has a small role in this. He's in one of his first non-wrestling related roles. Not worth the 5 bucks I spent on it. It was filmed early maybe 98/98. I can tell by Chris's pineapple hair but wasn't released until 2001.(Hey Lou! Maybe if you released it to the US in 2000, when my boys released No Strings Attached you may have made some money! Oh no wait...they were too busy suing you! and the fact that they didn't sue him for this atrocity still bothers me!!. Awful!",1435017600,,1228,4.142259414225942
