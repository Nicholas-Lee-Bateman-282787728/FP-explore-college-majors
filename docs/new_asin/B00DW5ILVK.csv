8598572,5,B00DW5ILVK,"Presents analysis of three thinkers - Keynes, Hayek, Marx. Even handed, with contrasting opinions that add interest. Closer to history lesson than economic theory, although both included. Well done.

Starts with Keynes.

Explains his key role as British economist at Versailles. Disgusted with amount of reparations demanded from Germany. ''He thought the demands were not only wrong, they were stupid!'' (See the film ''Paris-1919"" for extended coverage of Keynes role.) Shows his prescient book, ''The economic consequences of the peace''. Flanders says his key insight was ''If you beggar your neighbor, you beggar yourself.'' She applies this to the Greek meltdown. If Europe ignores problem in Greece, will it spread? Did not German economic collapse cause WW2?

Brief biography of Keynes life. Member Bloomsbury group. This desire to break rules, sexual and otherwise, encourages Keynes to create new economic rules. He does. Hoover dam example of application of his theory by Roosevelt. Stagflation weakens Keynesian ideas in seventies. Now, 2008, Obama resurrects Keynes and spends.

(One key omission is Bastiat's - ''That which is seen and that which is not seen'' ; 1840)

(''In the economy, an act, a habit, an institution, a law, gives birth not only to an effect, but to a series of effects. Of these effects, the first only is immediate; it manifests itself simultaneously with its causeit is seen. The others unfold in successionthey are not seen: it is well for us if they are foreseen. Between a good and a bad economist this constitutes the whole differencethe one takes account of the visible effect; the other takes account both of the effects which are seen and also of those which it is necessary to foresee.'' - Bastiat)

If Flanders had included Bastiat, this effort would be special. Sadly . . .

(''Now this difference is enormous, for it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the ultimate consequences are fatal, and the converse. Hence it follows that the bad economist pursues a small present good, which will be followed by a great evil to come, while the true economist pursues a great good to come, at the risk of a small present evil.'' - Bastiat)

Hayek -

Hayek's outlook driven by his terrible experience in postwar Vienna. Ruinous inflation, poverty, destruction of civilization. Government prints money to pay for the war. Destroyes entire economic system. Maybe Keynes is wrong.

Covers Hayek's insight that the interconnected economy, in fact any economic system, is too complex for anyone or any type of conscious, rational control. Belief in the mechanical model, building a bridge, is wrong. The correct comparison is a flower, whose growth mechanism is unknown. Plants are alive, bridges are not.

Explains Hayek's Nobel prize and his influence on Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.

Hayek says the bust, depression, are caused by government control of money and interest rates. Too low and boom. Too long and bust. Solution is privatize money! As Flanders asks - What politician will agree?

Marx -

Marx wrote about the industrial revolution he saw living in England. Prophesied the disintegration of capitalism (word he invented) due to worker rage. As Flanders points out, this has never happened. What did happen is non-industrial economic countries (Russia, China) adopted Marx.

Flanders notes that Marxist economic ideas have been shown false and rejected. Explains Marx's belief in materialism. That only physical conditions create human character and personality. Humans are only products of their environment, not what they choose. Ideas don't matter, only bodies. (Ironic that his writing, his ideas, have such striking effects.)

Hegel's profound influence on Marx is not explained.

(Frank E. Manuel writes in ''A Requiem for Karl Marx'' -

''There is a sharp distinction between the Judaism and Lutheranism that fed marx's early messianic vision and the Philospohy of history that he developed in his mature writings. The crux of the difference lies in the role of the individual in the historical process. For all their orientation toward a future kingdom of heaven, both Judaism and Christianity promulgated precise codes of individual moral conduct that were acceptable to God. . . . Hegel's world history, which permeates the Marxist ethic, is not a moral spectacle: it tramples underfoot many a noble flower in the achievement of its goal, the triumph of the Idea. By contrast, though Jehovah's ways are unfathomable, no true follower of the commandments of the God of Isreal is ever destroyed with the blind indifference of the Hegelian and Marxist historical process.'' - 238)

However, Marx' insight - the rage of inequality that drives much of the world - is profound.  Even if his economic ideas failed, his insights into human envy, human emotion, human pain, are keen.

Shows drawing of David Ricardo (without naming him) saying Marx adopted his ''iron law of wages'' that is, the belief that pay will always drop to bare subsistence. Flanders points out this has been devastatingly (for Marx) shown to be false.

(One other economist Marx borrowed from was Adam Smith. Marx used his ''labor theory of value'', which has also been throughly renounced. This superseded by Austrian ''subjective theory of value'', which Hayek promotes.)

One noteable omission in Marx is no economic system. What? Flanders explains Marx foretold the disintegration of capitalism, but didn't write a word about its replacement. Shows convinced Marxist who understands this problem. Nevertheless, sincerely hopes someday a better alternative will be found. Others say that willnot/cannot occur.

Numerous scholars identify Marxism with religion - not politics. Interesting video shows a large group singing the ""Internationale'' at his grave in England. Redolent of pilgrims visiting shrine.

These few omissions create the impression that these men created their systems from nothing. I think this non-historical method weakens the conclusions. Especially since this is a film presenting the historical outlook.

Offers comments by supporters of each. Paul Krugman, Joseph Stieglitz, Peter Schiff, etc., etc. . Uses English, American, Indian commentators. Bankers, economists, government officials, all are here.

8598574,5,B00DW5ILVK,"This explains a lot about the economic clash between America's political leaders. It's enlightening, and interesting. Masters of Money combines archival film footage with current interview clips of historians and financial experts. There is a conservative spin showing government spending eventually must be checked. There is a liberal spin on economics providing much historical evidence like Hoosier Dam & Boulder City. In the past, a new war aided recovery.
Stephanie Flanders is an excellent writer and narrator presenting approaches to the world market and how much government should be involved--if any. A well done, concise simplification, but no doubt will not end the economic political impasse.

SHD SUBTITLES  for all 3 episodes, each 50 min devoted to a primary leader
1 KEYNES (liberal spin of big government giving big help)
After the 2008 market crash it was up to government to find a solution for commerce that seemed elusive via capitalism. A new bolder opportunity for deficit spending evolved. Good? Bad? A look at John Maynard Keynes (British economist 1883-1946) may provide the answers. Bubbles will burst.

2 HAYEK (conservative spin of government hands-off economics)
Free-market is supported by Friedrich Hayek (Austrian turned British, 1899-1992, Nobel for Economics); and his reasoning may be accurate. How FREE can a market be in a government controlled society? Wrote ""The Fatal Conceit"", an intellectuals' attraction to socialism.

3 MARX (Communist with a basis of economic markets)
Communism founder, but also a capitalist opponent calling it ""unfair"" and ""unstable"". What were his alternatives to capitalism? Would workers overthrow the system as Karl Marx (German socialist, London after 1849, 1818-1883) believed? American earnings soar in recession for the elite wealthy, a Marx expectation. Is democracy threatened when business gains government aid while workers suffer--and pay?

Bonus: 6 really funny 60 sec cartoons that summarize economic philosophy. Watch this first, it really puts it all into perspective fast.
1 The Invisible Hand
2 the Paradox of Thrift
3 The Phillips Curve
