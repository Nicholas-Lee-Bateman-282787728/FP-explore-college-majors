3872318,5,B0028BVDB4,"I really like Amy Bento's approach to kettlebells. As a newbie, some of the portions are a bit beyond my ability, but most are right on track. She doesn't talk down to you, she's efficient & to the point. Plus there are 3 workouts so you don't get bored too easily. Happy exercising!",1271116800,,283,4.3584905660377355
3872319,5,B0028BVDB4,Speedy Delivery and absolutely loved the DVD.  I hope you she makes some more advanced kettlebell workouts ASAP!!,1269388800,,113,5.277777777777778
3872320,4,B0028BVDB4,"I've been working out with Kettlebells for over 2 years I would not recommend this for beginners. These workouts(3 complete workouts plus 3 pre-mixes)are challenging, but doable,I found it fun,and creative. This is my 1st video by Amy Bento, and I like her as an instructor. Amy does show some limited modification for some of the cardio and KBell moves, but not much. The trickiest Kbell moves for me would have to be the push ups in the ""horns"" down position and the swings, tap, change hands, if you attempt swings, tap, change hands move... you might want to try it outside 1st,  you just might drop the bell...it is a fun move however. The most challenging cardio move for me was the ""Deck Squats"" done for 1 full minute at a rapid pace. My favorite KBell move in this video was the ""wood-chop"" swings, really got my heart-rate up, a great fat burner and total body exercise...great for the abs to. What I didn't like about this workout was Amy did something like a cardio warm-up instead of joint mobility, but because her cardio was mostly plyo, she may have felt she needed the warm-up. Also I didn't like the jerky editing in some of the premixes, I'm spoiled by Cathe's smooth transition in their premixes. The KBell moves are advance and you can really see Phil Ross's (Certified RKC Level 2 and now her husband)influences in parts of this dvd. Amy's form is not perfect and with some of her moves you may have to modify to prevent injuries. For the most part I enjoyed this dvd and use it when I want to change thing up a bit. Note if you're a Kettlebell purist you probably will not like this DVD,(for you purist try Lauren Brooks DVDs, they're excellent), but if you want a non-traditional fun change of pace Kettlebell workout you'll love it",1269216000,31,1756,4.539432176656152
3872321,5,B0028BVDB4,"Amy tops the list of instructors for me. Her personality is just great and she is really good at creating advanced workouts. This one alternates kettlebell moves with cardio blasts which makes this a very effective routine. She uses a 20 lb. kettlebell and one move even uses 2 kbells - wow. I'm a heavy-weight junkie, so this is right up my alley. Some moves I have to modify or switch to a lighter kbell, but I love the challenge. Also has some premixes and an abdominal section. Amy is always creative with her ab work and this is no exception. If you love kettlebells (not the whimpy 4 lbs that is) then this is for you!",1246924800,27,624,4.3418803418803416
3872322,5,B0028BVDB4,What a great workout. It has three workouts and warmup and ab workout. Very intense. I am working out about 4 times a week but really felt the effects after her workout. I received instruction from a certified instructor and she does the exercises the same way he taught.,1348531200,,271,4.551020408163265
3872323,4,B0028BVDB4,"I read that you get into shape twice as fast with a kettlebell, and its true. I really liked the girl in this video too. She came across really well, and the exercises were easy enough for me to do right away. I could feel it the next day, just doing 15 min. The video calls for 15 lbs, but I used 10 lbs and still saw a noticeable difference within a few weeks just doing 15-30 min 4 days a week.",1347494400,,397,3.8536585365853657
3872324,2,B0028BVDB4,"If you're a kettlebell beginner, this is NOT for you. It says as much on the DVD case.

If you're experienced with kettlebells, you won't learn anything new - her form on swings isn't great, and even youtube has much more and better kettlebell content than this does. Most of it isn't even a kettlebell workout (!!) - it's just aerobics.

I don't know who (what fitness background or goals) would use this. It's just a bunch of exercises thrown together, with minimal use of light kettlebells.

""Kettlebell"" in the title is really misadvertising. I'm skeptical of the glowing reviews.",1327276800,,584,4.82
3872325,2,B0028BVDB4,"I have read the Bento has a lot of fans, but it was not for me. I like hardcore moves that flo. I didn't really feel the energy in her workouts. I am very advanced, runner, triathlete and love Hiit training. I won't be buying anymore Bento DVD's",1324598400,,245,4.125
3872326,2,B0028BVDB4,I was greatly disappointed by this video. It was so not what I wanted I had to fast forward through a lot of it just to see if I could tolerate it or find something useful.  It was also too easy...  If you have any experience with a kettlebell and you are looking for a hard core workout - this is NOT it.,1323302400,,305,3.8253968253968256
3872327,2,B0028BVDB4,"Pretty disappointing. The reviews suggested the work out would be difficult and the DVD is described as advanced, but when you factor in the warm up, stretching, and cool down - you are really only exercising for 12 or 13 minutes. Additionally, Amy uses different kettlebell weights and sometimes 2 for certain workouts. If don't have a library of kettlebells to work with, you have to improvise.",1315353600,4,396,4.925373134328358
3872328,3,B0028BVDB4,"I have enjoyed doing these short workouts....I have several other DVD's which I rotate often but this is one of my favorites when I am short on time....However, the editing is not very professional...On 2 of the 3 options, Amy tells you ahead of time what is coming up during the 30 second cool down then abruptly changes to another exercise. There are some repeated exercises on the workouts...I would have liked all 3 options to be completely different.",1312502400,,455,4.772151898734177
3872329,3,B0028BVDB4,"I have been doing Kettlebells for a few years, so not a beginner. This was just an OK Kettlebell workout. I felt like there was not enough use 0f the Kettlebell to target specific muscles and to achieve a cardio workout. Almost all of the cardio was achieved without the kettlebell by doing mountain climbers, jump shots, high knees and other aerobic exercises. Some of the kettlebell exercises felt more like a hand-eye coordination exercise or practice for cirque du soleil than a serious workout. Don't get me wrong, it was a workout, but could have been achieved in less time, targeting more muscle groups, using the kettlebell more and without the tricky (often seeming pointless) moves. It felt like the ""abs"" section should have been called ""core"" as not may ab muscles (especially lower abs) were worked. Guess I'll stick to my Angie Miller's Kettlebell Boot Camp - love that one.",1311465600,,888,4.848684210526316
3872330,5,B0028BVDB4,I absolutely love this workout. I works every muscle. Its challenging at times but isn't that what its all about. I like kettlebell workouts so much better than dumb bells ever since my first time trying a kettlebell workout with Jillian Micheals Shred it with Weights(also fantastic workout). You will not be disappointed with this video by Amy Bento. Hope my review helps.,1311379200,4,374,4.9523809523809526
3872331,5,B0028BVDB4,"Amy Bento is a fantastic kettle bell instructor.  Her guides are helpful, she gives you ample practice opportunity, her instructions are clear, the workout is tough.  I like that she mixes cardio in to keep the heart rate up.  She includes the necessary warmup and cool down stretches.  Some unique moves I've never seen as well to mix up and keep away boredom.  Nicely done!",1307923200,,375,4.707692307692308
3872332,5,B0028BVDB4,"I reach my limit fast when working out at home due to boredom and plateuing. This dvd simply keeps me interested, challenged and never bored. I love the fact that she has three workouts all on one dvd. She doesn't stop during your routine to do to much instruction and this is a good thing! It's good for two reasons. 1. your heart rate is up and your in your groove. She must have taken this into consideration when making this dvd and respects her audience enough to know we want a serious no frills workout. 2. Amy provides instruction in the beginning of her dvd before the workouts to help prepare you for the routines. I do have to say that you need to know how to do the basic kettlebell workouts first. This dvd is great for non-beginners and made for those who want an intermediate to advanced workout. Kettlebells are an amazing workout device and have changed my views on my own ability to workout and stay in shape for the rest of my life. If you pick up a kettlebell you will realize you're getting into something serious. You have to be serious about swinging a kettlebell, it's not easy to do the first time and done improperly you can injure yourself! If you want to make kettlebell workouts apart of your life then take it slow, learn the basic moves and then get this dvd. If you have made the choice to have kettlebells apart of your life and really noticed a dramatic change then get this dvd. You'll appreciate her instruction and flow. And you will sweat, gasp for air (at times) and high five Amy after your done. She rocks!",1306368000,,1547,4.393728222996516
3872333,4,B0028BVDB4,"I'm relatively ""new"" to kettle bells but am finding myself loving them and wanting to get as many different workouts with them as possible! I'm currently doing kettle bell workouts 3x/week and am seeing results!! I really like Amy's kettle bell workout because it's a little different and the moves are just as her title says....""dynamic"". I don't get bored with this video in my rotation. It's not an overly difficult workout to get through but I do find that I get a good overall workout from it. I like the many options that the DVD offers so I can do all 3 workouts if I have the time or the mini-workouts if I don't. Only complaint (and it's nit-picky but it bugs me): she messes up on her count frequently and you end up doing more on one side than the other with some of the moves. Also her cueing is not great at times. Since I'm used to it, I know it's going to happen and I can adjust for it. Other than that, I do like this kettle bell workout.",1306022400,,955,4.224043715846994
3872334,5,B0028BVDB4,"I really am enjoying Amy Bento's workout video.  She starts off with a warm-up!!!  What a great idea!!  She works out with you so you can see the effort she is putting in, what I mean is""no cut and paste video""  Which is a lie actually, she does have all her workouts combine into different workouts later in the video..  She has a great personality that comes through on the video..  I would buy her next video without a doubt!!  She is solid, she knows what she is doing and knows how to explain it!!",1297468800,,502,4.221052631578948
3872335,5,B0028BVDB4,"I recommend this workout especially for anyone who has been working out with weights for a long period of time, such as I have for most of my life. You will get an overall muscle tightness, firmness in a very short amount of time while losing fat, why? Because you are building muscle and doing cardio at the same time. All you need is a kettlebell for this dvd. None of those fancy equipment, pure and simple workout with how to's. I have been working out for at least two weeks and people are noticing the difference. I needed to lose 20lbs and already lost 10lbs.
Just do it for 3x a week.",1297296000,5,592,4.247787610619469
3872336,5,B0028BVDB4,"OKAY - this is the BEST workout I've found to get you a super toned & sculpted body! It only took me a couple times of using the kettle bells to get the moves down. I had never used them before & I have to say that THESE THINGS WORK Very well. Amy really knows her stuff!! She does an excellent job explaining each exercise & talking you through the workout. These workouts are pretty intense & get the job done in less time than many that I've done in the past. You will burn fat & tone up if you stay dedicated. I look better in my jeans/clothes than I ever have! I would say that unless you are pretty strong you will want to start with lighter bells than Amy uses. I went with a 12lb. first & also have 20's & 25 just like Amy that I'm working up to.
One move uses 2 bells at once & I found that two 20's are best.
2 of Amy workouts each time seems to be plenty. Give yourself a day off between - your muscles will need it! Also I would say very important is - plan to up your daily protein intake!
Don't be afraid to take in more protein. I bought a good protein powder & always drink about 40 grams after her workouts plus each morning. This helped me big time! Your body will need it & you will be rewarded if you feed muscles what they are craving...it also helps curb soreness :)
Get ready to work hard but also get great results!",1289174400,8,1339,3.9814126394052045
3872337,5,B0028BVDB4,"This is a fun and challenging workout.  Having done 2 rounds of INSANITY, I missed working out with weights.  I decided to go back to the Kettlenetics DVD.  I found the workouts to be quite sedate compared to the energy of INSANITY. I purchased a heavier k bell which included a Kettlebell Konnections DVD. It was OK but I was wanting something more.  This DVD is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  I purchased a 20lb k bell to use for this workout.  I enjoy the exercise combinations (challenging) as well as the 1 minute cardio exercises (INSANITY-ish).  I like that you can choose to do the workouts by chapters or by the premixes. Amy's energy is motivating and her cues are helpful.  I would definitely purchase another one of Amy's advanced kettlebell DVDs!",1289174400,2,761,4.626865671641791
3872338,5,B0028BVDB4,"Amy puts together an advanced workout using kettlebells.  The DVD is broken down into 3 separate workouts and an abs section.  You can do all three or just one, but believe me you will work hard.  This is not for beginners, choose a heavy bell be ready to sweat!!!  Amy is easy to follow and she give detailed instructions on each move.  Well done.",1286841600,,348,4.375
3872339,5,B0028BVDB4,"Kettlebells workouts are tough and so is Amy.  I am so excited that Amy has provided an advanced kettlebell DVD.  This DVD has three 20 minute routines.  The first time I did this DVD I thought, ""Oh, I can do at least two of the workouts since a 20 minute workout isn't very long.""  Boy was I wrong!  I'm an advanced exerciser and I was gasping for air five minutes into the first routine.  This is a good thing.

This DVD is clearly for advanced exercisers who are somewhat familiar with kettlebell training.

What I loved about this DVD:

**the intensity!  Okay, so I already said this, but it is so rare to find a truly advanced, intense workout DVD.

**Amy says what weight she's using, which is helpful.  She uses 20 and 25 pound kettlebells.  Needless to say, I don't even come close to those weights.  It's all I can do to keep up with a 12 pound kettlebell.  Ah, it's something to work towards.

**fun core section.  I have a love/hate relationship with core work and I'm grateful to Amy for making really tough exercises fun.

**separate chapter showing detailed breakdown of some of the more complex moves.  Amy is a master at explaining how to do a move.

Amy does this workout barefoot, which I would never attempt.  I'd be too afraid that I'd drop a kettlebell on my foot.  She explains that you can get a better grip on the floor and also will more easily remember to put your weight in your heels.  I will stick to wearing my shoes.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a tough, yet fun kettlebell workout.",1278374400,14,1531,4.405017921146953
3872340,5,B0028BVDB4,This Product is excellent.  It is everything the description says that it is.  I use this program in correlation with other work outs.  The drills in between each exercise is great. They definitely give you the pump and drive you need to go that extra mile.,1278201600,,257,4.543478260869565
3872341,5,B0028BVDB4,"BEST kettlebell workout dvd!! I have 3 others, and I like them all, especially Gin Miller's next, then Sarah Lurie's Iron Core 2, but this one is GREAT FOR more ADVANCED users - and those of us who want to WORK OUT HARDER -- WOW -- I'm almost 60 years old, but have been working out for 40 years and this DVD is a toughie but goodie.  Kudos!!!",1272412800,10,343,4.044117647058823
8356041,5,B0028BVDB4,"Wow!  Kettlebell workouts are VERY effective!  I just received this dvd recently and have only done a couple of the workouts so far but what I really want to mention is another dvd by Amy Bento called ""Absolute Beginners Kettlebell 3-in-1"" dvd also available for purchase on Amazon.  I bought the beginner dvd elsewhere so I'm unable to leave a review here on amazon for that particular dvd but I have to rave about it!  I've had the dvd for a few years but didn't get around to trying until this last July 2015.  I had about 25 lbs I wanted to work on losing and decided to give kettlebells an honest attempt for a few months and see how it goes.

- This dvd includes a tutorial, beginner and intermediate workout, about 20 mins or so for each.  I really like Amy Bento's personality and style for this workout.  For a couple days after the first workout I was so sore in all kinds of new places, could barely walk, no kidding.  I think that motivated me more in the beginning to continue the workouts so I wouldn't have to experience the beginner soreness again ha!

- I started out with a tiny 4 pound kettlebell which was hard for me to begin with as silly as that sounds!  I made sure I could get through the beginner and intermediate workouts easily before increasing the kettlebell weight.  After about a month I moved up to a 10 pound kettlebell and started the whole dvd all over again with plans to increase the kettlebell weight again as it got easier again.  After another 2 months I decided to try a 15 pound kettlebell and that is very challenging for me, so I am currently alternating between the 10 and 15 pounder.

- Yes! I have lost weight!  Now, four months later, I have less than 10 pounds of the original 25 goal weight loss to go!

- Somewhere along the line, this workout helped me bust through a plateau number on the scale that I have not been able to achieve with any kind of other workout over the years.  And I have tried them all, every beach body program, the gym, walking, I even worked and taught at a particular women's fitness center and never got these kind of results.  So interesting to be getting better results with such brief but highly effective workouts.

- I do one 20 minute kettlebell workout about 2 times per week on average and about 1 or 2 days a week of a 20 minute walk and/or 20 minutes of yoga.  I just enjoy yoga in general to help keep the body stretched out.

- No diet for me, just eat normal with no ""seconds"" and cut out the extra sweets.  The kettlebells really get the metabolism going and about once every week or two I notice the hunger kicking in big time and just go for it and have a complete cheat day and eat...a lot!

- I am just now starting to purchase additional kettlebell dvds to add variety and help get the last few pounds off.  I know 25 pounds may not sound like a major amount of weight to lose but it's all relative and is a lot for my height of only 5'2"", not easy to lose when you are a shortie.

- I plan to continue working out with the kettlebell indefinitely, at least 1 day a week to maintain and also because I don't ever want to experience the beginner soreness all over again ha!!  In all honesty though I actually enjoy and look forward to doing these workouts which is so weird as I never felt that way about any of my previous workout experiences.

Highly Recommended!  Just be sure to learn the proper techniques first to avoid injury/setbacks and enjoy your results!",1448064000,2,3462,4.300925925925926
