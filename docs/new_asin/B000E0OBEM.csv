2476176,5,B000E0OBEM,"Much like most of you out there I first became acquainted with the `Vision Series' of aerial travelogue features on PBS television. Whenever I came upon one while channel surfing I'd immediately put the remote down and sit back and relax. It wasn't long before I decided these programs were something I'd never tire of watching and needed to be added to my private DVD collection.

Released in '06, `Visions of France' is the fourth high altitude tour in the series following `Visions of ... Greece / Italy and England'. As with the previous journeys the audience will be immediately whisked away far above the maddening crowd to view France in all its incredible architectural and agricultural glory. Add to the visuals an enchanting French soundtrack and soothing narration and your ready for departure!",1208131200,7,805,5.007462686567164
2476177,4,B000E0OBEM,"Having grown up in Orange, this experience was like going back home for me, except from a much better vantage point!

I agree that the French accent sounds out of place.  I have a feeling the narrator, Debra Marie Ducette, may actually be French Canadian (I doubt very much that she would ""fake"" an accent).  There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but we are given the impression that this is a French person, when in fact a few names are pronounced incorrectly, which is slightly distracting to a trained ear (OK annoying).  Otherwise one would hardly notice.

As far as the scenery, well, there is just SO much to choose from; France is cram-packed with beauty and history, secret treasures everywhere you turn.  The DVD could go on for hours.  But for 55 minutes and 20+ minutes of bonus footage, the cinematography is spectacular and hits all the highlights, as well as a few castles and some detailed landscapes.  The panoramic views are breathtaking.  The scenery speaks for itself.

Now, I look forward to flying over the REST of France!",1187827200,12,1049,4.745856353591161
2476178,5,B000E0OBEM,"I watched this video on public television.  I have never seen a video that contained more beautiful scenery, combined with with more lovely music.

I want to buy the video to plan our own trip to these areas.  The only problem I had with the program was that I would like to have had a map, or other guide to provide a better idea of just what areas of France we were seeing.  The titles of locations was a bit lacking.  But what a fantastic assortment of magnificent scenery.",1187827200,5,476,4.303370786516854
2476179,5,B000E0OBEM,"This is truely a spectacular travel video. I was enthralled with the eye candy! The only sense lacking in the series is smell. The music is soft, melodious, lively and pertinent.

  The naration is soothing and light. The visual quality is so crisp that as you fly over the acres of lavender you can almost smell it. Floating on the tranquil turquoise sea its as though you are there!

  Before purchasing the DVD I wondered why the video did not show Paris or other parts of France but after viewing it I came to the conclussion that patients is a virtue!

  I am chomping at the bit for more of this series and hope that there are years to come!

  Peace and sweet dreams follow this video.",1180224000,5,692,4.362204724409449
2476180,5,B000E0OBEM,"I understood from the beginning that Provence and the Riviera are not ""France"" but a unique section, distinct geographically and historically and accept the titles as the subdivisions they are, so do not understand some who have quibbled over what clearly could imply more in a series, nor do I understand objections to a ""fake French accent"" narration.

If you would yourself actually like to be a bird or glider plane or helicopter and glide over fields of lavender and pine trees, and up into the clouds with pink flamingos and sail slowly right past the ancient towns built into the cliffs and through craggy gorges, down the Rhone, into the Meditarranean and back, and see Provence and the Riviera and Monico as a seagull would, grab this opportunity.

I think even native French Provencal people should see this, as they can't possibly have seen this viewpoint before.

While typical ""travel"" videos showing bunches of tourists crowding into stores discussing restaurnts and hotels and places to visit have their place, this is not that at all.  This is the earth, this is history, this is beautiful, and no National Geographic photo layout could possibly capture it like this from-the-sky vantage point does.

I lived in Provence for eight weeks as a young American student in my youth and took the tours, ooh'ed and ahh'ed with the rest as our tour bus rounded the narrow curves of the craggy coast to reveal the jeweled wonders of Nice and St. Tropez...but this frees you from the bus and lets you glide all over.

One viewing of either tape is not enough, any viewing is a wonder.",1178928000,9,1590,4.7846715328467155
2476181,2,B000E0OBEM,"I completely agree with another comment - I could not believe they made a Visions of France without any footage Paris and the wine region.  I suspect they may be coming out with a Visions of France Part 2.  At least I certainly hope so.  I also agree that it's not as well done as Visions of Italy.  Visions of Greece and England are also pretty well done.  I just saw Visions of Ireland on public TV and can't wait until they release that one!  I could have obtained it for a ""donation"" of ""only"" $100 but, at that price, I think I'll wait until Amazon gets it.",1173139200,8,562,4.157407407407407
2476182,5,B000E0OBEM,"This is the most incredible DVD! Jawdropping views of France from the air...you almost feel like an eagle soaring over France. You'll never see this scenery by actually going to France, you have to see the flyover!",1169337600,8,214,4.8108108108108105
2476183,4,B000E0OBEM,"We own and enjoy many of the videos in this series, but found this new one of France a bit lacking in a few areas.  First we found it strange to call it Visions of France without any footage of Paris or the northern two thirds of the country.  We found some of the scenes repetitive and the two regions covered are actually redundant in some areas.  Unlike say, Visions of Italy, we found ourselves asking, ""Why don't they linger here some more?"" and ""Why aren't they zooming in for more detail?""  It is still an enjoyable video of some beautiful countryside, but in our opinion it is not up to the same quality as some of the earlier ones in the series.",1162512000,47,654,4.2926829268292686
2476184,3,B000E0OBEM,"This magnificently beautiful video would have been much classier without the annoying FAKE French accent from the female commentator, whose ""historical narrative"" was bland and devoid of any useful insight.

Just keep the American accent in the main tract, and have an optional French-language tract.  The French accent is beautiful in spoken French, not in any other language.  American speech is also beautiful...there's no need to substitute.",1155427200,12,445,5.611940298507463
2476185,5,B000E0OBEM,"Great Disc! I only wish the company producing this series would hurry up and publish more discs on more places.

2476196,4,B000E0OBEM,"There was a time when National Educational Television was sponsoring special expeditions to fly over and film specific portions of Europe. There was one particular episode called ""Visions of Provence"" and I believe that this was re-released as the present disc. That would explain why, as other reviewers have noted, three quarters of France is not seen. I happen to find Provence and the surrounding areas quite beautiful, and they are well documented to good advantage here, with a couple of problems. Other reviewers speak of the insipid French accented comments, and I would agree with that, but I find a bit more annoying a huge emphasis on sailboats on the open waters with a half dozen renderings of ""La Mer"" in the background. Provence is NOT the Mediterranean, and I would prefer more scenes of the attractions of th Hilltop towns and castles than all manner of Sailboat or Freighter. What is in fact shown is absolutly glorious.",1308268800,3,938,4.90566037735849
2476197,1,B000E0OBEM,I totally expected some footage from provence with lavender fields and more discussion. All this is is a video from the air with music to it....no real meat....horrible!,1302652800,2,169,5.071428571428571
2476198,5,B000E0OBEM,"A relaxing way to explore the South of France and plan your next trip.  Very well done, enjoyed in silence or with the commentary.",1302566400,,130,4.416666666666667
2476199,2,B000E0OBEM,"While the other ""Visions of Europe"" made me want to rush out and buy a plane ticket, this is a Vision of France noone would care to visit.  I can't help but wonder if this was the producers intent.  Here, a beautiful country is reduced to a few minutes of the Cote de Azure followed by endless repeats of what looked to be the same set of small nameless hilltops in Provence.  This is not France - it is a ridiculous waste of time and helicopter fuel.  Don't put yourself through it.",1276732800,4,483,4.217391304347826
2476200,5,B000E0OBEM,"This was a gift for my daughter in law, a french teacher.  she was thrilled.",1262044800,2,76,4.066666666666666
2476201,1,B000E0OBEM,"This claims to be shot in HD but the DVD's are not blue ray and the quality of the video on new flat screens isn't very good.  Also, at certain times the narration does not coincide with what is being shown.  The narration script also seems jumbled up--the narrator will sometimes return to a previously shown topic at random.",1261958400,2,326,4.508474576271187
2476202,5,B000E0OBEM,"This magnificent two-disc set ""Visions of France"" is not only affordable, with good views of some of the most costly vacation spots in the world--but--it also is breathtaking footage of some of the most beautiful Mediterranean coastline anywhere around that sea.  The astonishing skills of the cameramen and helicopter pilots are also matched by the informative narrator and the host of musicians (both vocal and instrumental) that provide background music for one of the best video travel documentaries that has been made in the 21st century. (It was first aired in 2004)

One can get carried away with superlatives concerning this unparalleled series of HD aerial photography documentaries consisting of many countries. ""Visions of France"" is also now available within a set called ""Visions of Europe"" (see my review).  I recommend, with no reservation, ""Visions of France"" which includes two parts: Visions of France: Provence and also Visions of France: The Riviera.  BUT, if you have not seen, do not own, other Visions of Series DVDs then by all means go to the listing for ""Visions of Europe."" Apply $$ to the ""Visions of Europe"" set and get more for your money. Every country filmed in the Visions of Series is worthy of five stars, top productions, and buying the mainland set saves even more dollars.  YOU WILL WANT MORE AFTER SEEING ONE COUNTRY VIA THE HELICOPTER'S HD VIEW.

Details:
Provence begins with a look at the TGV High Speed Train. I have a nightmare story of the TGV, having been on the train from Paris to the Riviera when it had it's first ever malfunction. Train officials were NOT prepared. A day later, on another train, passing through the Rivera, the view was good but not nearly as good as you will see on this DVD set.

I enjoyed learning much more with this DVD set than the travel through the country via train. This DVD is very educational as well as beautiful. Such as, Avignon and it's 5000 years of habitation. And white rocks between rows in vineyards keeping grapes warm at night in Chateauneuf-du-Pape. You'll see the Rhone River banks are as adorned with castles (chateaus) and cathedrals as Germany's Rhine River trip (See review of Visions of Germany.)

Arles gives a glimpse why Vincent Van Gogh was so inspired in his painting there.  Also you see mountains of sea salt--oceans of vineyards--vistas of lavender--towers of limestone cliffs--herds of wild white horses--and flocks of flying flamingos that could only be bested by a truly fresh French baguette/cucumber sandwich eaten with your toes in the Mediterranean Sea.

So, off to The Riviera, DVD #2.  You see not only all the main cities, miles and miles of coastline, but mansions, luxurious hotels, world renowned casinos, and yachts you and I can't afford to ride on, let along own. As a matter of fact, this DVD is the only affordable way to see the Riviera. It sure beat my train ride through the area.  Honest!

Background music with this DVD included Pachelbel's Canon in D, Jesu, Joy of Man;s Desiring, and the William Tell Overture, among much more.  Some music in both DVDs include classical as well as traditional or folk. A beautiful mix for the ears like the scenic panorama is to the eyes.

After you're done viewing France, and if you get it all, other countries of Visions of Europe (the mainland), then by all means continue your video travels with Visions of Britain and Ireland (also available on Blu-Ray as is this France set). This is HD at it's best, and I'm talking the standard, as I've not seen it on Blu-Ray, which is supposedly even better.

For a twist to your DVD traveling enjoyment, I also reviewed and recommend ""Brian Sewell's Grand Tour of Italy"", a road trip with loads of added historical enjoyment.

For me, these Visions of Series DVDs from my living room armchair sure beats those over-the-Atlantic plane seats.

If you were expecting hunks and babes on Riviera beaches with skimpy suits--this set is much more sophisticated than that. This is vista photography on the level of Picasso, Matisse, and other modern painters. Lean back, dip your baguette in olive oil, and let your senses be tantalized.",1252281600,5,4140,4.856534090909091
2476203,5,B000E0OBEM,"These two DVDs about southern France are so beautiful! One is Provence and one is the Riviera. So beautiful! It made me want to travel there. The scenery is amazing and spectacular - the mountainous formations in southern France are breathtaking, the mountaintop and seacoast cities and towns are impressive and charming. You will enjoy these very much, and I believe they would be a nice gift for anyone who enjoys this area. Bon Voyage!",1234828800,3,438,4.8533333333333335

Service from the provider was excellent, however and the transaction was smooth.",1373500800,,362,4.553846153846154
