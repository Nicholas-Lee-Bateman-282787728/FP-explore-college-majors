4482142,4,B004V6JPRS,"The Title says it all. a VERY disturbing film. But good! This is not your standard, Low Budget, B movie, with a physcho killer. It is a Low Budget, B Movie, with a BUNNYRABIT killer. LOL! I Didn't want to believe this Bunny was evil, because he is just so dang cutee! Yes. you heard right. Not a Guy wearing a hockey mask, or a Burnt man with knives for fingers, Angry dolls, or Greedy leprechauns. But something much.......much.......Worse. A BUNNYRABBIT. lol. It is a good, fun movie to watch. it Isnt the best, and deffinatally, not the worst. Has some Very Disturbing scenes. BRUTAL Killing scenes. Pretty good special effects. Very original Idea also. I Give it Props for that. Check this out, if you want to have a good time, or a cheap scare with your friends.",1320883200,,767,4.525179856115108
4482143,1,B004V6JPRS,"I was really looking forward to this movie; some reviews referenced this being like Texas Chainsaw with a bunny mask and so forth and the trailer makes it look pretty good. However this pathetic amateur horror movie failed on every account. The weak, unfocused story, lame characters, I could go on and on, but I just won't. Trust me when I say (or don't, it's not my money you're spending), if you are wanting a good horror film and pick this up, you will be disappointed.",1315094400,10,473,4.511627906976744
4482144,1,B004V6JPRS,"All the people who gave this a top 3,4,5 star must work for the company that produced it. This is nothing more than your run of the mill B movie and that is giving it credit. The graphics where horrible, the actors where worse, the sound was awful, and the video content looked to be shot with a home video camera (fisher price at best).",1313366400,5,337,4.2
4482145,1,B004V6JPRS,"Bunnyman is the story of a group of  20-somethings driving around on back-roads eagerly heading somewhere, when they run afoul of some creepy inbred locals, and end up learning why you never drive back roads and annoy inbred locals. Yes, you have seen the same exact plot 500 times before, and no, this time is not better than any of the times before.

After cutting off a  dump truck with blacked out windows, and a harrowing (LOL) 20 mph pursuit through the back roads of  Virginia, our car full of goofs  decides to pull over to escape the mystery drivers wrath, only to have the evil truck follow them. Then, after arguing about how no one is sure what to do, they decide to ""wait him out."" Seriously. The guy just tried to kill them with his truck , albeit at 20 mph, and they decide to sit in he car until he leaves. For hours.

""Not gonna be nice? We'll wait.""

The truck does leave, only to drive them off the road again later on, which prompts the characters to sit and stare out of the windows for what seems like another few hours... Then the truck comes back, hits the bumper of the car, and leaves again! What is going on in this movie!

This movie features some of the dumbest characters I've seen in a long time,, doing some of the stupidest things I've seen in a long time. For 50+ minutes they meander around slowly, and I mean slowly, and go on and on about not knowing what to do. When one of them dies? Meh. They walk slowly down the road, emotionless and unaffected. Then they take a nap, after which they wake up cracking jokes. Who wrote this dreck?

""I can't believe Tom's dead... what a day! LOL!""

The Bunnyman shows up eventually, and the slasher movie truly begins... to suck even more!  The Bunnyman as it turns out is a part of...wait for it... some quirky and creepy inbred family, who just happen to love killing passers by... do you see where this is going? Good.

Bottom line:Bunnyman comes off as goofy as opposed to... whatever it was supposed to come off as I guess. Even the old go-to of slasher flicks, the kills, are lackluster. Most are implied or partially shown, and aside from some spraying blood here or there, offer us nothing exciting to redeem the rest of the movie's flaws. The acting is plain old bad, the story is tired and stale, and the movie is about as tension filled as a broken rubber band.",1312761600,7,2347,4.370114942528736
4482146,2,B004V6JPRS,"after seeing the other reviews i thought this was gonna be a good movie , but i have no idea  what the other reviewers was watching , cause it couldn't have been this , to say this was a disapointment , was a understatement , they did get one thing right tho this is a low budget movie , but the movie was just plain stupid , it made me feel stupid for watching it , i mean i know people r suppose to make dumb decisions in a horror movie , but this people literally wanted to die , there decisions was absurd!!! here r a few cases, one they r walking down the road and decide to go down a trail that is littered with crosses in the ground and bones hanging from trees???? i mean come on !!!!

4482147,5,B004V6JPRS,"This is just a fun film. It's clear the filmmakers had fun making the film, but more importantly it translated to the film as well. It doesn't aspire to be thought provoking, after all the film is called Bunnyman for a reason. If you just look at the story, it's a standard slasher film. However, the filmmakers made up for the fact with a unique spin on the genre, and with a unique, almost iconic new horror villan. I can really see this film building up a cult following.... I mean it has a giant bunny listening to classical music as he tortures someone to death with a chainsaw ! I can safely say I've never seen anything like this in a horror film. A few final thoughts.... it's clear the filmmakers were inspired from horror films of the 70's and 80's which is a nice change of pace from all the ""modern"" slickly produced horror films of today. Also, I would encourage picking up the DVD, since streaming the film is one thing, but there's a ton of extra's on the DVD, as the other reviewers have pointed out, which really show us, the audience, what it is like making a low budget indie horror film.... to say they all seemed a little crazy is a understatement, but there's no denying that they came out at the end of the experience with a fun film that I happily recommend to other horror fans.",1309737600,,1303,4.344262295081967
4482148,5,B004V6JPRS,"Great thriller. Blond character, Tiffany, is frighteningly good at being murdered. Those screams are still shaking my insides. The character relationship needed more development which you can really see in the deleted scenes section on the dvd. Those are a must see!!! You really get a feel of the cast of characters and their personalities and also a few good laughs! Distribution is not easy, so for a very low budget film I would say great work! I recommend it.",1308700800,,464,4.8125
4482149,5,B004V6JPRS,"This is a surprisingly fun and entertaining horror film. It has a look and feel of the older classic horror films, which is very much appreciated. It's a throwback to the older classic 70's and 80's horror films. The film is played serious, and although it does have moments of humor, it's not cheesy !

I usually rent these type of films to make fun of them, ""cough cough"" megadinosaur vs megashark ""cough couch"" so I thought, a horror film with a giant Bunnyman, this has got to be a train wreck. However when it started, and the super 8 footage started playing, I immediately knew that this wasn't some cheesy b-movie shlock, and that a lot of heart and effort was put into it. (on a side note, I haven't seen the DVD, but I heard that there's a ton of extra's that show the brutal honesty of what it's like to make a low budget horror film, so I have to check that out, however at this writing amazon is sold out again, argh) anyway back to topic at hand....

The main thing I took away from the film, is that the Bunnyman character is intriguing, and I would like to see more of him. There's a lot of psychological things going on, like when he's reluctant to take off his Bunny mask during the table scene. yes it's straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but with a cool twist, which brings me to my next point, this film seems to be about contradictions. The theme of contradiction comes to play repeatedly in the film. We see a giant Bunny costume, and we think it's innocent, then it proceeds to rip a girl in half. We expect this film to be cheesy, it's not. We expect Bunnyman to die at the end of the film, like the antagonist in 99% of horror films do, which he does not. This is what I enjoyed most about the film, I never knew what was going to happen.

When the scene of some young blonde woman is captured and about to be tortured (yes we have seen this thousands of times) the Bunnyman character comes onto screen, starts playing classical music, and brings out his chainsaw, then I realized, well I haven't seen that before..... and that's what I like the most about this film, it lures you in the with familiar
preconceived notions of the horror films we've seen countless of times, but then it veers of the path into something unique and different.

Yes, this is a low budget horror film, which I find adds to it's charm. It's has a more gritty, realistic feel to it, instead of the overly stylized modern horror films. It looks great, and the filmmakers seem to have gone for broke when shooting it, from car chases to blood, lots and lots of blood. This was a breath of fresh air in a genre really needing to change things up. Who knew it would come from a giant seven foot tall Bunnyman :)",1308614400,,2715,4.317647058823529

4482151,1,B004V6JPRS,"My confession.....I only lasted for 35 minutes on this movie. I love a good horror movie and this was nowhere near it. This was at best painful to watch and at worst very painful to watch. let me summarize, 6 insipid and odious 20 somethings pass a truck on some remote road, the driver in a bunny suit gets pissed and chases them and honks at them, all while having a girl in the open back of his truck??? ( why not jump out) they slow down and he passes and honks they pull over and he pulls over and one of the girls gets out to talk to him and they wait for him to leave and he does and he is waiting further down the road....well you get the idea. Finally they crash the car and walk down a lonely stretch of road (really????) see bags of bones hanging in trees and keep going on (really?????) After them asking for the 30th time ""what should we do"" of each other I turned it off. You have to root for them to die, horribly.",1408406400,2,929,4.027027027027027
4482152,3,B004V6JPRS,"""Bunnyman"" or ""Bunnyman Massacre,"" which ever you prefer as they are the exact same film, is a moderately creepy and effective indie thriller. The eerie footage at the beginning of the film is perhaps the creepiest part; from that point forward, there is a decent amount of gore that sits in between some big holes in the plot, some shoddy acting, and a so-so script. Basically, this is a genre flick, nothing more. If you are an indie horror fan, this would likely be worth your while. But for the average moviegoer, there is likely just not enough in the way of substance to keep you entertained, and while the scary scenes are a bit unnerving, there's nothing here you haven't seen before.",1398384000,,692,4.634146341463414
4482153,4,B004V6JPRS,"I saw this on chiller and liked it. I was surprised when I got my DVD that it was uncensored with a completely new beginning of the film.

I will definitely see it agein soon someday maybe.
I also think that its gonna win some of them Oscar and emmy's and SAGet rewards cause its a great movie that doesn't come along very often !!
Nope, you don't see too many movies like this out there come along too often !",1382918400,,481,3.9183673469387754

4482156,1,B004V6JPRS,"Wow. I love B-horror, and I expect a degree of stupidity within a B-horror film, but this one was WAY, way too much. Please read prior reviews for examples, will not waste space reiterating the multiple examples. This movie is for you if you enjoy being bored while thinking to yourself endless phrases such as ""that was really stupid."" ""Now that was even stupider."" ""Nobody would ever do that."" ""The stupidest person alive would have not done that."" Again, I expect these in a B-horror film, but in this film these are ENDLESS. Others have commented on the laziness of the writing; I cannot think of any other explanation, unless this was written by a ten year old or someone raised in an isolation tank who has no clue about human reactions, emotions, logic, etc. NOT a so bad it is good movie, just awful, terrible, pointless.",1369180800,,829,4.64625850340136

4482159,5,B004V6JPRS,"I have to say I was very impressed with BunnyMan. I always loved the legend and I still believe it, this film brought the story to life. It is the only movie that was made for it anyways so I give credit to that. I've noticed that this movie has bad reviews, it doesn't bother me to watch it though because everyone dislikes something out there. I think BunnyMan was filmed to be low budget since the story line and where it was filmed at is suposed to be like Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; both are very the same and both are filmed very disturbingly and filmed like its really happening on set. The blood and gore action is very realistic just like the movie Slashers Gone Wild, this movie deserves to be 5 stars its awesome!",1360022400,,740,4.330935251798561
4482160,1,B004V6JPRS,"I wanted to like this. The trailer looked creepy and even if the movie wasn't scary, it could be unintentionally hilarious. Cheryl Texiera is nice on the eyes. And what could be better than a man in a bunnysuit trying to kill people. Believe it or not, the parts with the Bunnyman are the best in the movie. Carl Lindbergh is trying his best to be threatening but he's hilarious. But this movie is bad. This movie suffers from wanting to use things that work only when done by masters. It tries to go for that silent, cheap feel ala Texas Chainsaw Massacre but instead of it having an atmosphere it feels like a rip-off. Alot of filmakers get this idea that if you make every character a jerk, that makes them more interesting. Well if that's the case, the cast here are the most interesting ones I've ever seen. Alot of filmakers also get this idea that if you use something innocent like a Bunny mask for the killer's get-up or innocent music in the background it will somehow make the movie more creepy. While this gimmick can work great sometimes like in Jeepers Creepers, it comes off as daft here. The scenes are cut together so much that you don't know who has lived. The movie is funny yet irritating at the same time. A dead zone. It's among the worst movies I've ever seen.",1359158400,,1283,4.417721518987341
4482161,1,B004V6JPRS,I cannot believe someone would put a movie out in this condition! The sounds and music was never completed and the editing is very clunky! For a company to expect consumers to pay money for this is beyond belief! This is an unfinished product that doesn't  even have the potential to be a whole movie unless everything is scrapped and done over! They should've went back to the old drawing board with this one!,1355702400,,410,4.54054054054054
4482162,5,B004V6JPRS,"I thought that this movie was very good in fact because let's face it most movies today drag on. Least this movie has a plot or storyline to it. Most movies don't have anything at all. Bunnyman is a very good man and yes it's very entertaining to say the least. Anymore who thinks that this movie is horrible should watch all those remakes like the fog, and Carrie:the rage because those movies were badly made and Bunnyman is a very good film made. Perhaps it is a low budget film but it is what the title saids it is a bunny killing people. Most title films just give you the run around for the whole entire film. But Bunnyman is well made and worth every penny. I would tell people to watch this movie unlike you people who don't give many horror movies a chance.",1347494400,,766,4.2534246575342465
4482163,1,B004V6JPRS,i went into this movie with an open mind and considering that the trailer sold this film pretty well i thought i should parttake.

4482164,4,B004V6JPRS,"I give this movie a solid four stars. If you are a fan of indie horror films, like I am, you must check it out. It's just plain fun. A lot of fun. A man running in a bunny suit stalking teenagers. Although they don't show the killings, it's more than implied with the amount of bloodshed splattering all over and it does seem very realistic the way they do it. I read some negative reviews before watching this and was worried but I was very pleasantly surprised. I loved it. I could watch this movie over and over just for the entertainment factor alone. The movie doesn't really drag either like a lot of other B rated movies I have watched- it really moves along and I really enjoyed the extras too. It's loaded with TONS of extras which makes the price totally worth it. I am really looking forward to Bunnyman 2. Can't wait!",1336694400,,829,4.32051282051282
4482165,2,B004V6JPRS,"This could've almost been 3 stars if it wasn't for the laziness of the script. It was a ""Cheesy but Funny"" concept that could've almost work for me; lots of blood, lots of action and suspense, interesting cast...But the way the script was written made some of the scenes a bit illogical. Now i know what you must be thinking : A movie where a man with a chainsaw is dressed as a bunny is not very logic anyway. That's true. But they could've at least made it a funny ride for the viewers.....

The main problem is the lack of decision and initiative from the characters. The opening scene on the road for example, where the main cast is being followed and harassed by the bunny man in his truck is way too long....they don't know what to do! they all look so desperate but no one speaks, no one has an idea or a solution ! They stop the car because they're too scared of being followed and bump in but then: Nothing! They're all freaking out in the car on the side of the road for what seems like an hour, not knowing what to do! Again, no initiative, no ideas, not even a cell phone....Nothing!

The movie does get a little better after the first 30 min....Once they finally realise they're being chased by a freak with a chainsaw dressed  as a bunny things do get a little more interesting and funnier but then again, the lack of initiative from the cast remains a little annoying sometimes. I mean c'mon, you guys are like 5 healthy individuals and this freak is alone, AND dressed as a rabbit...lol......At least we get a few interesting bloody scenes and some action (after the first 30 min of course....) The guy playing the bunny is good, he's a funny freak. The cinematography is also very good, nice picture quality.

A few minor changes would've made this film another hit in the ""Best worst movie ever"" tradition. I still had a good time watching it, but I'm aware those type of movies are not for everyone. Give it a try if you want to have some good laughs with your friends but don't expect to be blown away....

Amazon have shortened their return policy from 90 days to 30 days.
