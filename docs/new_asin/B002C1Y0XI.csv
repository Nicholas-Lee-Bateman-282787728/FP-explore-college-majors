8362787,1,B002C1Y0XI,"Video is very blurry. Although I watched it anyway because I love seeing the concert footage from their early days, the guys had at this time maybe 6 songs...Caleb has the same charming way behind the mike now..",1311984000,2,211,4.578947368421052

8362789,1,B002C1Y0XI,"not much more to say about it...
great footage and potential but,
the audio and video is not much better than terrible!",1260403200,4,119,4.454545454545454
8362790,2,B002C1Y0XI,"This DVD combines two previously televised concerts in to one DVD.  First 10 songs are from 2004, very cool to see the band play the older songs, the sound quality is very decent, but the picture is poor.  I think the lack of picture quality is due to the age of the footage, it was never intended to be on a 1080p Hi-Def Flat Screen.  The producers of the DVD probably never went back and got the masters to upgrade the picture.

The last three songs (Fans and Arizona are great on this) is much better; still not HD, but sound and picture are good enough.

If you are a big KOL Fan its worth checking out, just know going into it, that this DVD has its limitations.",1258588800,11,667,4.1796875
