3002638,5,B000XJ5UFS,"There's something special about the new comedy ""Blonde and Blonder"" that makes you want to smile through the whole film. It's not the surprisingly solid comedic performances from Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, or the impressive assortment of various mobster, detectives and supporting characters. It's the tone, which director Dean Hamilton has skillfully balanced between innocent humor and sophomoric absurdity. True the film's press materials, ""Blonde and Blonder"" finds its strength from combining the appealing characters of ""Legally Blonde"" with the downright goofiness of ""Dumb and Dumber."" The final product is a thoroughly pleasing comedy that will appeal to a broad variety of audiences.

Anderson and Richards play two clueless blondes who witness a mob hit and are mistakenly identified as the killers. This sets into motion a complex series of events with compounding mistakes made by the blondes driving the action and comedy. Kevin and John Farley are especially hilarious as two, bumbling mob henchmen, bringing to life the memory of their famous late brother, Chris Farley. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Meghan Ory are sassy, sexy and fun as the real mob killers, now out for revenge against the blondes for stealing their assignments and fame. Adding yet another layer to the plot, the police are on a manhunt for all of them, which sets the stage for a wacky but logical finale.

Technical credits are solid, with crisp cinematography by C. Kim Miles, and great comic timing from editor Stan Cole whose many feature credits include ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Baby Geniuses"" and the thematically similar ""Porky's."" HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1199664000,13,1648,5.359073359073359

Had they gotten the timing down, and done more running small gags like those, this movie might have been a bit more entertaining.

Don't expect to see something like the females version of Dumb & Dumber, this one does not hold a candle to it as it is too afraid to go where it was expected to go, and falls short on the attempt at gags it does have.

8228381,3,B000XJ5UFS,"""Blonde and Blonder"" (2007) stars Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards as two blonde bimbos who are mistaken for notorious assassins. They're chased by the FBI, the real assassins (two sharp brunettes) and others.

I personally find air-headed bimbos annoying and neither Anderson or Richards trip my trigger in this movie (on a physical level). Anderson was 39 and Richards 35 when it was shot, with Anderson looking past her expiration date. But they're likable enough as the ditzy blonds. The first 25-30 minutes were pretty bad with literally nothing striking me as funny or interesting, but then the duo meet the mob boss at the Beaver Patch (a so-called ""gentleman's club"") and the sequence was so over-the-top I couldn't help but laugh. The movie won me over, sorta, as I laughed both with it and at it.

Emmanuelle Vaugier and Meghan Ory play the assassins, Cat and Kit, dressed in tight black leather outfits practically the entire film. Vaugier in particular is effective.

The locations are good, shot in Los Angeles & Santa Clarita, CA, Niagara Falls and British Columbia. There's a boat chase at the end reminiscent of ""Live and Let Die,"" albeit no where near as good.

""Blonde and Blonder"" is only worthwhile if you like the stars and appreciate really dumb humor. Most of the jokes fall flat, but it's consistently fun & zany and without idiotic toilet humor, except for the farting turtle. The biggest problem is that the entire first act is weak and seriously tempts the viewer to tune-out, but if you can resist it you'll catch the groove and be amused, IF you like dippy humor.

The film runs 95 minutes.

8228382,5,B000XJ5UFS,"If you like light-hearted comedy and also love Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, you will enjoy this movie. Both are great in this.

I really couldn't see anyone other than Denise Richards starring with Pam Anderson- she holds her own in the beauty department and they play off each other really well. I was surprised how funny they were!

The Farley brothers are in it, they play two dopey henchmen for the mafia. They have some really funny bits and are great comedians too. Lots of silly, playful fun. There are some scenes (without Pam & Denise) that drag a bit, but otherwise overall the movie moves along well.

The jokes and the plot is just silly and fun: The ""Dumb"" Blondes are mistaken for an infamous, female mafia assassin known as the ""Cat."" And the mix-up that ensues between the girls-- the mafia, the real ""Cat"" assassin, the police, etc. is hilarious.

The opening scene with them flying a plane and crashing onto the golf course is hilarious!

Jokes:
They are listening to a song over the radio in the car- Denise asks ""What is this?""
Pam replies ""Oh- that's the ""Sound of Music"" (Julie Andrews)
Denise says "" Oh that's cool but what music is this?""

When I want to watch something light & fun, I pop this into my dvd player.

I was surprised to see negative comments for this one but I guess it all depends on your expectations.
I rented it at the video store and was simply looking for something that was more wholesome & fun to watch-not violent and depressing. And it fit the bill.
Turned out, I enjoyed it and I have rented it several times. So I just I decided to buy it.",1393804800,,1595,4.441780821917808

If you're not, you may not like this film. Second, this film is meant to be a fun, no brainer, ridiculous, and funny movie. It's not meant to be taken seriously. Everything from a turtle with uncontrolable flatulance, to going round & round through a turnstile door, to mistaken identity as female assasins. I'm telling you (being a big fan of both ladies), I laughed and found this film quite enjoyable. Also I was pleasantly surprised to see Emmanuelle Vaugier (Mia on Two & a Half Men), who I also love, playing the villain. She was great!

So to recap: If you like Pam & Denise, you like silly senseless comedy, and like to laugh - get this. The titile says it all.",1344470400,8,835,4.457516339869281
