8747592,5,B01AJWTT6E,"This group is one of the most talented on the planet. Everything about this concert/documentary is first class. The audio and video quality are outstanding. Their songwriting far exceeds most other groups that are better known.

I played it for a friend who had never heard of them and he immediately loved it and wanted to get his own copy of it. I came to this page to purchase another copy for him only to find it is no longer available.

I think it is just downright sinful that I can't purchase another copy of something so wonderful but there are about ten tons of trashy material (meaning stuff I wouldn't watch or listen to if someone gave it to me) that is readily available for sale.",1497744000,,693,4.448818897637795

8747596,5,B01AJWTT6E,"Perfection. Rehearsal and concert footage with top notch sound quality. You get a sense for the personalities of the musicians, how they work together, and how this wonderful, interesting, and intricate music is put together.",1473465600,2,225,5.457142857142857
8747597,5,B01AJWTT6E,"note: a US format version is available in July, but if you have a ""universal"" player, you can get this from Amazon.co.uk or direct from the band at [...].

I was fortunate to be present at the first Big Big Train concert for 17 years when they played at Kings Place, London on Friday August 14, 2015 (followed by two other shows that weekend). This blu-ray shows how they transformed from a purely studio-based band (in fact, rarely being in the same studio at the same time while recording) into a band that could recreate the sound, arrangements and emotions from their albums to a concert stage.

The film intersperses documentary footage of the set-up and execution of the rehearsals at Real World Studios, with full play-throughs of many of the songs which formed the concert set list. There are also 4 songs recorded at the Kings Place concerts, which show not only how well the band were able to transition from ""studio to stage', but also the incredible power of their live performance.

This film is recommended for anyone who wants to see what talented and committed musicians have to do to successfully deliver three amazing concerts. The music of the highest order, and the performances, the intricate arrangements, the powerful stories and emotions in the songs and the sheer joy emanating from the band while playing make this an essential purchase for both fans of the band and lovers of intelligent rock music.",1459900800,6,1426,4.812244897959184
