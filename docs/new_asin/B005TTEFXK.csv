4892642,5,B005TTEFXK,Great acting. Russell Harvard did an excellent job of bringing Matt's life to the big screen. I love how they incorporated the captioning so the deaf and hearing audiences both can enjoy the movie.,1328054400,2,197,4.823529411764706

4892645,5,B005TTEFXK,This was a great movie and a great price!! Bought this myself to show to my high school students. They are now asking me to watch it again because they loved it. I was meeting with each student during the movie so that they could do their expressive parts of the test and found myself wanting to watch the movie instead because it was so good! Highly recommend this movie and high school ASL students love it!,1481241600,,409,4.324675324675325

4892649,5,B005TTEFXK,This is a great movie! I have a friend that is Deaf and he shared this movie with me. I had to purchase and keep in my collection. It is a perfect picture of how many hearing parents try to suppress their children and force them into an atmosphere they don't feel comfortable in and many other situations the Deaf face in a hearing world. This is a very enlightening film!! Very inspirational - A MUST SEE!!!,1464220800,,408,4.311688311688312

4892655,5,B005TTEFXK,"Loved it. i used it with my high school sign language students who also loved it.  Just one downside. A few of the scenes have the deaf signing in darkened outside shots with poor lighting and at a distance, so almost impossible to read the signs. Also, some shots have the signers hands drop out of sight of the camera. Once again signs are lost. But most is readable. Good dialogue, fun characters.",1455148800,,400,4.47945205479452

4892662,5,B005TTEFXK,Great movie. I have seen it numerous times. It is all true and I met Matt a few times in person. He is the real deal. Russell Harvard does a great job portraying Matt Hammill even though he needs to be bulkier. This is a minor detail in the movie that I can skip. The cast is stellar and I love the grandfather who is perfectly portrayed with his gruff manner. Same goes for the mom figure. Watch it!!!,1436313600,,402,4.10126582278481

4892665,5,B005TTEFXK,Great movie... I am currently learning american sign language and wanted a movie with a deaf story line. I recomment this movie because it gives the viewer an idea of some of the challenges deaf people face from day to day. The main character was able to triumph and live his dream.,1435017600,,282,4.4423076923076925

4892668,3,B005TTEFXK,"As a former HS and college wrestler and major MMA fan(I dabbled in it back in the late 90s) I of course looked forward to this film. Considering its low budget the flick is well done. I love movies based on real life. Recommended for any wrestler and/or hand to hand combat fan, and to those that enjoy seeing the overcoming of adversity.
  The lead doesn't look much like the real Matt Hammil but seems to be a good actor. I wish they would have thrown in some footage of his MMA highlights and I couldn't find a Blu Ray version of the film, but that's getting picky.",1431043200,,568,4.25

I do wish this was on Blu-ray though...",1423699200,,331,4.354838709677419
4892673,5,B005TTEFXK,"All teachers that teach American sign language as a foreign language should buy this video or request a Librarian to obtain it for all schools.
The movie tells all in the life a deaf /male student and his daily struggles in a hearing world being mainstreamed verses attending a school designated for the deaf.
 Even though today this is not the case if you reside in a town that has qualified interpreters that also aide in an oral program using a holistic approach to lip reading and the incorporation of sign language is optimal.
I believe it sends a strong profound message to parents that have deaf children to keep them close to home and not send them off for those that are too far from a caring  parent could easily fall to prey for sexual predators.",1420502400,,757,4.518248175182482

4892685,5,B005TTEFXK,"We have all heard of ""the Hammer"" but never understood where it came from.  This shows just how much Deaf can do.  Shows how quick they are to catch on and shows how underestimated they are.  It is a must for anyone wanting to learn about the break out Deaf, who still give back to the community (which is the Deaf Way)",1399248000,,319,4.112903225806452
4892686,5,B005TTEFXK,I love it beautiful and well made.  I use every day.  I recommend to all to purchase it. It is Ideal for a gift present.,1397433600,,120,3.76
4892687,3,B005TTEFXK,"It's a good movie and shows some good points and also old time views about deafness.
Some good points were:
->the audiologist correcting the grandfathers' mindset: ""No, you have an incredibly intelligent grandson who's profoundly deaf.""
->""I try not to speak around you. I'm doing this for you. But English is my first language. We didn't grow up the same way. You need to accept me for who I am not try to change me.""
-->Believing in yourself.
-->The grandfather learning how to SIGN his last words to his grandson.
--> Despite all obstacles, succeeding in life.

Some old time views (but were in compliance with the time of the movie):
--> using the term ""Deaf and dumb""
--> When the grandfather forced the son to look at him by turning his chin.
--> Hearing family being controlling of the deaf person and violating privacy (such as opening letters)

**When signed scenes appeared in the movie, subtitles for the hearing were incredibly small and unreadable. You must pause it to read if you didn't catch/or don't understand ASL. Ironically in the special features, the whole thing had subtitles instead of closed captioning. They were also small, yellow and incredibly hard to read. You would think a deaf movie would have closed captioning on their special features for the deaf (and for the hearing in the signed parts)!!!!!!!!***

Overall this movie will give you an understanding of what it's like to be deaf, the deaf views, and hearing views. Also it will give you an understanding of what it's like to be mainstreamed in a hearing world all your life and then the awing experience of entering a deaf world like you, and being able to know what everyone is saying but at the same time feeling lousy in your signing because of your mainstreamed background.",1392768000,2,1765,4.780327868852459
4892688,4,B005TTEFXK,"Purchased this for my sister's family who has three kids who were all wrestlers and two of them went on to be wrestling coaches in their adulthood.

4892694,5,B005TTEFXK,"I am deaf myself, so I really appreciated the movie.  It was interesting from beginning to end.  I liked seeing how he grew up, and how he dealt with things in life before he got into real professional fighting.  Some scenes are unforgettable, and people can definitely relate.  It had comedy, drama, love, sport, and all types of feelings/genres in one movie. I love the movie.",1381449600,,378,4.681818181818182

4892696,3,B005TTEFXK,"My 2 boys are wrestlers (age 8 and 10) and I bought this film to inspire them before the wrestling season begins.  It was a good inspirational film and gave us new insight into athletes with disabilities.  I found two scenes inappropriate for young children.  There was a scene where Matt enters his college dorm room and his roommate is having interracial sex with another student.  There was no nudity but I felt that scene was unnecessary and could have been avoided.  There was another scene where Matt goes to a party and there were students drinking heavily.  I know these are realities of college life but I thought this was a sports ""family"" film.  I would not show this film to young children.",1379635200,11,702,4.612903225806452

4892698,5,B005TTEFXK,"I enjoy the movie and never knew about the Deaf fighter. I only got the movie cause a friend of mine is an actor in it and I actually had to see him in this and his character was actually funny and very flirtatious. Way to go Mike! I was even more amaze that they did portion of it at the school that I actually attended and I have to say. Overall, it was great. I enjoyed it and learned alot about Matt Hammill as well and what he represent for the deaf community such as myself. Never let people tell you what you can and cannot do, you can always be something better, never let your disability stop you from achieving your goal. Remember disability or not, we all struggle to get where we desire the most!

4892715,5,B005TTEFXK,I will write a full review after watching the entire movie.  I watched the special features and began the movie but had to do other things.  I was impressed with what I saw so far. This is a real story about a real person.  I am biased as I wrestled at his weight class in college and know that he was seen as a super stud wrestler. I am excited to go and watch the rest of this movie.  I think this might show that wrestling has more than just Vision Quest.,1356912000,,458,3.9456521739130435

4892718,3,B005TTEFXK,"A very nice personal touch story...but the overall acting performance is a pretty raw.  It feels like it is ""made for tv show"" instead.

I aware that Actor Russell Harvard needs to improve his acting performance (using his ""passion"" vision if that is possible).  He still has a long way to become a better actor.  I personally had seen his singing performance at the public event.  That was wayyy much better than he did in this film.  Just a sayin.",1354579200,,449,4.55

From the first scene, I was immediately drawn into the story and interested in learning more about the struggles of the deaf.  I think it is a good movie for anyone to watch.  I have seen ""The Hammer"" wrestle in the UFC; learning more about his past makes his accomplishments that much more impressive.",1352678400,,453,4.357142857142857

4892723,4,B005TTEFXK,Good movie to have around if you teach an ASL class to older students.  It's a great movie to show that not all deaf/hard of hearing students communicate in sign language (whether it is ASL or some sign supports) and that sometimes eventually they find themselves in a world that they feel comfortable with.,1338076800,4,307,4.685185185185185

4892727,5,B005TTEFXK,"At last, I was able to order The Hammer DVD from Amazon and was curious how it'd turn out.  FINALLY, a professional made film showing a realistic portrayal of a deaf man born from a non-signing hearing family who went to a hearing school without an interpreter,etc. Finally, here was a true story about a deaf boy struggling through with a hearing family who supported him on all levels but just could not understand his need of sign language to communicate effectively.
Watching this film tonight, I got emotional since I could highly relate to his experience - never quite fitting with the hearing world and never fitting to the deaf world.

How so refreshing to finally see where the most overlooked or oppressed deafies who are ignored, made fun of or scorned...this movies finally shed light for us Deafies who fall through the cracks.

Since I also love wrestling (the HS/college kind - not the fake one on TV) -- and it was great to learn how Matt worked his way up to national championship. You can't help but feel like jumping from your seat and cheering for him gesturing Hammer! Hammer! Plus it was great fun to see RIT's campus - it's same as ever - I loved seeing all the crowd of Deaf signing away conversing with each other - very typical scene at a all Deaf community places.
To my relief, in ""The Hammer"" - all the actors were professionals - it wasn't Hollywoodish at all, nor amateur low budget all deaf type thus I appreciated this film even more.  I wish there would be a sequel -- it's just the tip of the iceberg of a deaf man's journey in life and more needs to be shown to the hearing world to understand us better.

One of the neat feature and educational effect was how the film cleverly turned off the sound to show Matt's deafness for high pitch tones (I assume) and garbled sounds of hearing people speaking when he used hearing aids and then the hearing person's capacity to hear the waterfall... finally - I hope this helps hearing people to understand what deaf go through.

Importantly, I also like how this was a hearing-deaf friendly relationships. However, I was disappointed to learn this film was about 65% accurate according to Matt's observation- (he stated he pinned his opponents fast - not a long time like shown in the film) but that's how movie industry are - add a bit of drama to make it 'enticing' for customers to watch it - but at least I got an inkling of Matt's journey on this planet.
I will be buying the film for my hearing family! A must see film to watch - if you want to learn a bit about realistic deaf people - this is the film to watch! Spread the word!
Cheers for Matt!",1333152000,,2632,4.438923395445134

4892730,4,B005TTEFXK,"I first saw this film in the theater in December of last year. I really enjoyed the film and, as a wrestling coach, I thought the wrestling depicted was pretty good (only a few small errors that don't really detract from enjoyment of the film). More importantly, this is a great story about finding your way in life as Matt is torn between two worlds, hearing and non-hearing. Your girlfriend/wife/daughter will also enjoy the love story component. We showed the film in our school auditorium because I thought it was such an important story for people to see. The people associated with the film were great in helping us promote the showing and we will be forever grateful to them. You will feel uplifted and better about life after watching The Hammer.",1329091200,3,754,4.71969696969697
4892731,5,B005TTEFXK,"This film was my favorite film at Newport Film Festival and it was also my girlfriend's favorite. We both saw over 10 films, some were pretty terrible but both this one and Trollhunter rocked! This film didn't win the audience award at Newport for no reason.

Everything about this film was strong. Story, Cinematography, Dialogue, Character, Music, Acting, etc etc.

Except for one supporting actor.

He comes into the film early on as the best friend of our protagonist. They're both deaf and he serves as a mentor to deaf culture. His name is Jay, as played by Michael Anthony Spady.

Tell me already, was he bad or good?

He's beyond good. I have never seen a more charismatic performance in any film since Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption.",1328486400,,754,4.769230769230769

My 4 year old son and I first went and saw this movie when it was in theaters, and I knew as soon as it was on DVD I was going to buy it. This movie does much more than just tells a story. It allows the viewer to have a small glimpse on what is like for someone who is not like them. It shows the true adversities that Matt Hamill went through to get where he is today. I like the fact that its main focus was not on the UFC or even wrestling. The main focus was on Matts life and all that he went through. It shows the viewer that no matter what obstacles you may face in your lifetime it is possible to overcome them. It has moments where you can't help but laugh, and in the next you can't help but cry.",1328313600,6,754,3.748427672955975
4892733,5,B005TTEFXK,"This film is groundbreaking. The first feature length film of its kind. Written and Produced by Joseph McKelheer and Eben Kostbar, Directed by Oren Kaplan with Matt Hamill's full support. The Hammer is based on the true story of the first deaf NCAA Wrestling Champion and UFC Fighter, Matt ""The Hammer"" Hamill. This film follows Matt from childhood to navigating through college on his mission of becoming a national wrestling champion, despite what some would call his ""handicap."" The Hammer is the first of what we hope will be many films and tv shows to feature a large amount of deaf and Hard of Hearing cast/crew. Matt Hamill supported the originally slated star, Eben Kostbar (Writer/Producer), to fill his shoes. However, the writers/producers chose to cast a deaf actor in the role for authenticity. This proved to be the greatest decision they could make, as it opened many doors for Deaf/HOH people in the film industry. This film features some ASL with subtitles for the hearing audience. The audio is edited in certain parts for the hearing audience to try to experience what it would be like to be deaf; although no hearing person can truly understand what it's like. While watching this film you will experience many emotions. There were moments that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. Wrestling has never been so exciting! The entire cast is extraordinary and deliver pure emotions on screen. You will fall in love with Russell Harvard and Michael Anthony Spady will become your new best friend! In theaters the film is fully captioned, however you may turn that option on or off while watching the DVD. Extra features were fun to watch. This film was accepted into 8 film festivals, and swept all 8!  This is the first film of its kind; story is one of triumph and inspiration which the writers and director captured beautifully.",1328227200,22,1899,4.807339449541284
