8485141,5,B005SHYFDI,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like ROH, DragonGate, and NWA with this event is their annual singles tournament (with it being all in one night this year) with the winner being able to have any type of match against whoever they want in future.

The first round of this tournament featured such matches as the P.W.G. debut of Dave ""Fit"" Finlay against Kevin Steen in a bout that saw Finlay punish Steen like how nobody else has in what really came off like a grudge match just based off how 'stiff' it was between both men, Claudio Castagnoli vs. El Generico in a match where both men played off each other so well that saw various unique counters to moves I've never seen before (too many to list here), Eddie Edwards vs. Roderick Strong, and Willie Mack vs. Chris Hero.  The next rounds of the tournament featured Willie Mack vs. El Generico that started with a funny dance off, Kevin Steen vs. Eddie Edwards, and the finals between Steen & Generico which was exactly what you expect for anyone who knows their history with the highlight being that Steen kept focusing & picking on a ""Little Jimmy"" in the audience who was wearing an El Generico mask throughout the match.  Non-tournament matches include Young Bucks (who again were in the mist of controversy based off their WWE tryout) defending the P.W.G. Tag Team Titles against The Kings Of Wrestling (Hero & Castagnoli) in a match that went back & forth that had some comedic moments causing the crowd to chant ""incest"" along with a lot of references to their recent controversial tryout with WWE & backstage incidents with RVD & Booker T, and The Dynasty vs. RockNES Monsters in a #1 contenders match in a match that got so out of control with the brawling in & out of the ring that the fans asked ""Who Is Legal?""

If your a fan of the tournament format then you will really love this event as the two extra tag matches were the extra ""sizzle to the steak"" as this is one even I recommend.",1333756800,,2172,4.604651162790698
