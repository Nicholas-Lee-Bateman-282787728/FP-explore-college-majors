4109294,5,B003CJXJ4A,"Here's Lucy ran for 6 seasons, each of 24 episodes, from September 1968 to March 1974. I hadn't seen it for 30 years until a few months ago when it was re-aired on my local TV station. I enjoyed it very much, but after two weeks I noticed that the total program air time dropped from about 24 minutes 20 seconds to less than 22 minutes overnight. I realized that the station was cutting over 2 minutes from the episodes after that. So I immediately reacted and ordered the first 3 seasons DVD sets.

I then discovered after comparison to the recorded versions I made from the TV, that the TV station had not only made the cuts, but had also speeded up the program by 3 seconds a minute so that they could reduce the overall air time further, by over a minute. Playing the DVD's revealed that the original episodes ran for 25.5 minutes! No wonder so many people are buying TV show DVD's after seeing commercial TV's butchering of original content, and the on-screen intrusions. This should not happen to classic works of art. (TV stations are in fact advertising companies, with an insatiable desire to speed you to the next group of commercials.)

I was delighted to get the DVD's, as they were very good quality sound and picture, and each episode setting was a visual delight. They had informative introductions to every episode and had about 2 hours of extras per season.

This is classic TV at its best - very warm, entertaining and funny with good sound and live music, with many famous guest stars of the time. This has to be one of the best additions to my DVD library. I hope that it won't be long before seasons 4-6 are released.",1280448000,5,1638,4.471571906354515
4109295,5,B003CJXJ4A,"if you love lucy you need to get this set. full of more comedy, definally entertaining for the whole family. my 11 yr old adores everything lucy and he loved watching this and cant wait till the next season....",1279584000,,210,4.410256410256411
4109296,5,B003CJXJ4A,"With more consistent writing, and an impressive list of guest stars, the third season of Here's Lucy (1970-71), is probably the most entertaining of the first three seasons of the comedy, featuring the legendary Lucille Ball.  Co-starring is the marvelous Gale Gordon, along with Lucy's children Lucie Arnaz , and Desi Arnaz Jr.

In the previous two seasons, the program had achieved a reputation, for featuring some of the biggest names in entertainment as guest stars.  Those who almost never made guest appearances on television, made an exception for Lucy, as episodes were specifically tailored to suit their particular persona.  Season three opened with the biggest pair of stars yet, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.  Burton impersonates a plumber to escape his adoring fans, and winds up at Lucy's office repairing a sink.  Somehow Lucy gets Elizabeth Taylor's massive diamond ring stuck on her finger, leading to a hilarious ploy to deceive the press.  Taylor's comic timing is marvelous, in what was the highest rated episode in the history of series.

The parade of heavyweight stars continues, with the master of horror Vincent Price terrifying Lucy, who actually believes he is a homicidal fiend.  Lucy injures Sammy Davis Jr.'s nose, and then disrupts the production of the versatile entertainer's movie.  Prepared to write his memoirs, Jack Benny returns again.  In his third appearance, Wally Cox is a diamond cutter who a suffers series of mishaps, that has him repeatedly bouncing in pain on Lucy's couch.  Lucy's close friend Carol Burnett, also returns to Here's Lucy for a third time, in an episode which features a grandiose variety show, a Jack Benny cameo, and Carol planting a ferocious kiss on Harry.

With other career options opening up, Desi Arnaz Jr.'s time as Craig was drawing to a close.  Buddy Rich, is spotlighted in an episode where the legendary hard pounding drummer, is featured giving Craig some pointers on the fine art of hitting the skins.  Another great episode features Craig and Harry turning voyeur, filming Lucy and Kim in their daily activities, finishing boisterously at the local library.

Extremely goofy, but still kind of fun, ""Lucy The Coed"" features the season's big musical production number based on college life.  There's plenty of great stuff featuring Lucy and the kids tormenting Uncle Harry, as in ""Lucy & The 20-20 Vision"", when they try to convince him that he is having vision problems.  In ""Lucy Stops A Marriage"", the gang mistakenly believes that Harry is getting married to guest star Jayne Meadows, and set about ruining his reputation.  Harry extracts some major revenge, in an episode when he becomes the houseguest from hell, totally disrupting Lucy and Kim's lives.

Vivian Vance, Lucy's longtime co-star on I Love Lucy (1951-57), and The Lucy Show (1962-1968) returns for more comic mayhem in a two part adventure set aboard a cruise ship bound for Hawaii.  With Lucille serving as the assistant cruise director, there's plenty of singing and hula dancing aboard the ship, including Harry prancing in a muumuu, and a great solo dance performance by Kim.

While some of the humor is timeless, because of the heavy emphasis on celebrities, having some familiarity with the various guest stars is essential to understanding the humor on Here's Lucy.  For instance, if you aren't aware who Rudy Vallee was, odds are the episode featuring the megaphone using singer, won't make a lot of sense.  Because of this factor, the series may not play too well to today's audiences, but for those of a certain age, the program is pure gold for entertainment nostalgia.  Of the three seasons available so far, this is definitely the one to get first.

Each of the 24 episodes is close captioned, and features an introduction by someone involved in the production of that particular episode.  There are more extras than ever before, including a fascinating featurette on the Burton/Taylor appearance, vintage home movies, an excerpt from Lucy's radio program featuring Doris Day, and an appearance with an amorous Jack Benny.  Also included is a hilarious episode of Make Room For Granddaddy from 1971, starring Danny Thomas and featuring Lucy Carter.  As intended by Lucie and Desi Jr., these extremely high quality DVD sets, pay a fitting and fabulous homage to their beloved mother.  For a little perspective on the passage of time, it is interestingly to note that in 2010, Lucie Arnaz is now approximately the same age as her mother in this season.  At 59, Lucille Ball is in great shape physically, and has not lost at step on the dance floor.  Reflecting the show's comedic muscle, Here's Lucy finished the 1970-71 season at #3 in the Nielsen's.",1278288000,7,4721,5.02827763496144
4109297,4,B003CJXJ4A,"While Here`s Lucy is not as good as her earlier shows like The Lucy Show, it is still very good. Much better than any of the gunk that
infests tv today. Lucy is still paired with Gale Gordon. And those two had such a wonderful comedic chemistery together that they just
couldn`t help but be funny.
And this season has guest appearances by some of the truely outstanding comedians of the time like Jack Benny, Carol Burnett, and
Sammy Davis Jr.
It`s not one the outstanding comedies of all time, but it is very, very good. Watch it and remember the good old days when tv comedies
were actually funny.",1277164800,3,599,4.454545454545454
4109298,5,B003CJXJ4A,"What a great release Season 3 of Here's Lucy is!!  Got mine last week from Amazon and have watched over half of the episodes. Trying to spread it out ....  Lucille Ball was the best comedienne of all time, and knew what worked on her show.  Love Gale Gordon, Vivian Vance when she guested, and of course Lucie and Desi, Jr.  They are the best, too -- and thank them very much for gathering those important people to give us more insight on the episode introductions.  It adds so much to the overall quality of the DVD. Loved seeing the ""extra"" on the making of the Burtons episode, a true Lucy classic!!  and, I cannot forget Carole Cook, Lucy's long time friend and frequent guest star.  Fantastic job!!  Thank you all!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Here-s-Lucy-Season-Three-4pc/dp/B003CJXJ4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Here's Lucy: Season Three (4pc)</a>",1277078400,4,896,5.442028985507246
4109299,5,B003CJXJ4A,"Here's Lucy Season 3 is a very funny season.  It starts of with one of the most hilarious episodes of the series ""Lucy meets the Burtons"" guest starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  And it doesn't stop there.  There are many funny moments in this season, like when Lucy goes skydiving, or the two part episode ""Lucy goes hawaian"" guest starring Vivian Vance.  It's a really great season, and if you buy this you will have a great time watching the queen of comedy!",1276732800,4,473,4.595238095238095
4109300,5,B003CJXJ4A,"In my opinion ""Here's Lucy"" season 3 has some of the best episodes in the serie's history.  Here's Lucy was the third highest rated series during the 1970-71 season ranking no. 3 with a 26.1 rating.  This was the year that Lucy finally topped ""Laugh-In"" (which had fallen from no. 1 to no. 15; although while competing against ""Laugh-In"", ""Here's Lucy"" never fell out of the top ten shows.  Season 3 of ""Here's Lucy"" also was CBS-TV's no. 1 rated series.  The most memorable episode of season three was ""Lucy Meets the Burtons"" which premiered in September of 1970 and was the no. 1 show for the week and had a whopping 53% share of the television audience.  This episode garnered two Emmy Award nominations; one for writer's Bob Carroll, Jr. and Madelyn Davis for Best Writing In A Comedy Series ""Lucy Meets the Burtons"" and one for Gale Gordon as Best Supporting Actor In A Comedy Series. However, I don't understand how the television academy overlooked Lucille Ball as Best Actress In A Leading Role In A Comedy Series, Best Comedy Series and Jerry Paris for directing the Burton/Taylor episode.  I guess they passed over Lucy because up to that time she had already won four Emmys and had 13 nominations and since comedy was changing nominations went to Mary Tyler Moore and Jean Stapleton.  This was the year Lucy should have won Emmy number five.  There were so many great episodes:  Lucy's Wedding, Lucy:  Part-time Wife, Lucy and Jack Benny's Biography, Lucy All American Mother, Lucy The Crusader, Lucy and Carol Burnett and the two part Hawaiian episodes with Vivian Vance.  Again, there is only one Lucy and in season three she really shines and is in top form.  I applaud MPI for doing such a great job on this series that has been overlooked by many.  I can't wait for the release of season four which opened with Lucy and Flip Wilson (another classic episode).",1270166400,13,1875,4.679878048780488
4109301,5,B003CJXJ4A,"Here's Lucy Season 3 will be available for purchase on June 15,2010! MPI Home Video has done an absolutely fantastic job of making beautifully restored, great prints of these old shows available on dvd with fantastic bonus material! This is another great season of Here's Lucy, beginning with the highest rated show of the series, Lucy Meets The Burtons. Richard Burton is wonderful in this show, especially when he speaks a line from his native Welsh language, in response to Lucy asking him if he's English. Lucy steals the show at the end when she has to use her hand with Elizabeth's ring still on it, as Elizabeth's hand. You can't stop laughing at Lucy's comedic genius!

There are so many guest appearances in this season by Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Sammy Davis Jr., Gary Morton, Buddy Hackett, Joe Jackson Jr., Buddy Rich, Charles Nelson Reilly, Marilyn Maxwell, Vincent Price, Wally Cox, Jack Benny, George Burns, Rudy Vallee, Art Linkletter, Jayne Meadows, Carol Burnett, Robert Alda (Alan Alda's father) and the beloved Vivian Vance in the last two shows.

As if the great comedy and great guest stars aren't enough, the musical numbers throughout the shows are absolutely fantastic this season! You can't believe Lucy is dancing with this much energy at age 59, and her children are unbelievably talented as well! In Lucy And Carol Burnett, the cast really outdo themselves singing and dancing. Carol Burnett imitates Jeanette MacDonald and Ruby Keeler and Lucy imitates Marlene Dietrich to a tee! Daughter Lucie dances like Bo Jangles Robinson and the whole group does a fantastic Hooray For Hollywood and Singing In The Rain. You can see Lucy's talent started as a dancer way before she got into comedy, in this season, and it certainly was inherited by her children! And the fantastic dancing doesn't stop here! In Lucy's Wedding Party, Lucy dances with all the Greek men at the wedding, and I get tired just watching her move that fast! The finale of this season 3 is a two part show called Lucy's Hawaiian Vacation. The cast never actually went to Hawaii, as they never got off the cruise ship, and once again the finale of an unbelievable Hawaiian dancing and singing show, put on by Lucy, is just fantastic! Vivian Vance is her guest star along with Robert Alda, who is Alan Alda's father. I have seen Robert Alda in dozens of television shows, but never knew his name and never knew he was Alan Alda's father! He plays the ship's captain who both Vivian and Lucy try very hard to get his attention.

This season 3 has everything- great guest stars, great comedy, great musical entertainment and even finishes with Vivian Vance co-starring with Lucy in the great Hawaiian Cruise! This is the last season for Desi Arnaz Jr. to be making regular appearances. With this Season 3, we are half way there of owning the entire Here's Lucy Series- only 3 more to go to have the complete 6 seasons. MPI has also been doing a fantastic job of restoring and releasing Lucy's rare television specials on dvd, along with these wonderful Here's Lucy shows.

I have been keeping in contact with CBS and The Lucy Show Season 2 has been pushed further ahead to a release date of July 13, 2010 and The Lucy Show Season 3 will be released on October 12, 2010. CBS is again making perfect, pristine copies with more unbelievable bonus extra's! Between MPI and CBS, I'm truly in Lucy heaven!

4109303,5,B003CJXJ4A,"By the time ""Here's Lucy"" rolled into its third season in the fall of 1970 on CBS, many of Lucille Ball's contemporaries were slowly fading from the television landscape. Stars like Jack Benny, Ed Sullivan, Eddie Albert, and the clan on the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" were facing retirement as the networks thought the public became tired of seeing these stars week after week. Such was certainly not the case with Lucy. ""Here's Lucy"" finished its third season as the third highest rated series on network TV and came in as the #1 show on CBS. A lot of this was because by the third season the audience became accustomed to the premise of the series with Lucille acting with her real-life children. The fact too that nearly every big Hollywood star wanted to be on ""Here's Lucy"" surely helped with the show's ratings. Without a doubt the most popular episode in the series' history is the season opener that debut on September, 14, 1970 entitled ""Lucy Meets The Burtons"" in which Lucy has none other than Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as guest stars. In that episode Lucy mistakingly puts a ring on her finger owned by Liz and can't get it off. Other guest stars that year included Sammy Davis Jr., Vincent Price, Jack Benny, Carol Burnett, and Rudy Vallee. The final two episodes were also filmed in beautiful Hawaii for a two-parter. This DVD set includes all 24 episodes restored from their original master tapes. There is a wealth of bonus material in this four DVD boxset including new episode introductions by Lucy's kids Lucie and Desie Arnaz Jr.; a rare interview with Vivian Vance; syndication promos; Lucy blooper reel; Lucy's home movies from Hawaii; behind the scenes clips; and much more. The set drops in stores on June 15th, 2010. MPI, the studio releasing the ""Here's Lucy"" DVD's, has stated that it is dedicated in releasing all ""Here's Lucy"" seasons so don't be shy in purchasing these sets with the fear that future sets will not be released. Three more seasons and all 144 ""Here's Lucy"" episodes will be available on DVD for posterity for future generations to enjoy.

Unfortunately, the subtitles for this entire series of DVDs must have been outsourced to someone operating at rock-bottom fees, possibly in the rural parts of a developing country, and with no access to Google. I'm not joking: Anything that can be misheard, misunderstood or misspelled is promptly mangled. ""Roquefort cheese"" becomes ""Rugford"". ""David Niven"" - ""Nevin"". ""Vivien Leigh"" - ""Liegh"". ""Comme a"" - ""cum sa"" (??!!). The list goes on and on. After a while, these ridiculous mistakes completely distract one's attention from the actual story.

4109316,5,B003CJXJ4A,"From season 1 to season 3, Here's Lucy has become a constantly better show and has become more enjoyable to me.  This is definitely the best season I've seen because the scripts are funny; the singing and dancing top-rate, the physical comedy realistic and classic Lucy; and the characters and usually the guest stars work well together.

1. Lucy Meets the Burtons
Classic show, it is beyond words and is Lucy's post- I Love Lucy best.  Despite some difficulties backstage, all three stars put on a great show and play well off each other.
2. Lucy the Skydiver:  Classic family show based on a realistic storyline
3. Lucy and Sammy Davis Jr. Horrible Lucy being the fool.
4. Lucy and the Drum Contest
This is a classic show showing Desi and Buddy Rich having a great duet together.  It has great verbal comedy and the love and warmth Lucy shows for her son makes her craziness wonderful.  Desi Jr. messing up the contest so the poor boy, Jose, to win is truly heartfelt and highlights the inequality exists back then for Spanish Americans
5. Lucy the Crusader:  Classic.  Lucy is a smart woman making fun of the corrupt business word, fine print, and faulty guarantees.  A great timeless show.
6.  Lucy the Coed
Great!  Lucy sings and dances wonderfully and her young girl high pitch voice and most of the dialogue is hilarious.
7. Lucy the American Mother
A good family show that has some great physical and verbal comedy.
8. Lucy's Wedding Party
The highlight of the show is when Lucy and the Greek men dance a traditional Greek wedding dance.  It is also funny when she tries to make everyone hide from Harry and the ending is enjoyable but predictable.  The rest of the show is okay.
9. Lucy Cuts Vincent's Price - Not my favorite
10. Lucy and the Diamond Cutter:  A cute episode with some great facial comedy and lots of funny lines.
11. Lucy and Jack Benny's Biography:  Classic and funny from the beginning to the end.
12. Lucy and Rudy Valley
Lucy and Harry's facial expressions are priceless when Harry pulls out a chair and sits down in front of her, and when Rudy remarks about Lucy's age.  Lucie is funny as she makes remakes about trying to help Rudy learn rock music.  The musical numbers are great because they show Lucy and Lucie have the same build and can really dance  (Both have great, sexy figures with beautiful legs)and you can see them both work off one another's energy to make great chemistry between them.  They dance like pros.  Rudy's signing is dismal but the chorus helps ""Let the Sunshine In"" be an OK number and he does all right with Winchester Cathedral.
13. Lucy Loses Her Cool
Great ensemble show with everyone getting in on the laughs and Lucy causing havoc.
14. Lucy, Part-time Wife
Classic Lucy filled with hilarious dialogue, great physical comedy as she eats pickles and ice cream and gets locked in a steamer or adjusts her ""baby"" (a pillow).  Harry and her interaction is hilarious as she tries to help him out of his feared soon to be engagement to an old college classmate.  Lucie, has a great scene where she scares her mother with a doll she found.
15. Lucy and Ma Parker
Another undercover story this time done beautifully.  Lucy is hilarious as Ma Parker.  The script is witty, Lucy's expressions timeless, and the rest of the cast have their moments too.
16. Lucy Stops a Marriage - Fair.
17. Lucy's Vacation - Fair
18. Lucy and the 20/20 Vision.
Great family show with a hilarious Gaslight scene and funny dialogue.
19. Lucy and the Raffle - Fair
20. Lucy's Houseguest, Harry
Good family show with some hilarious moments (Lucie and Lucy exercising next to Harry, Lucy stuck and getting out of a tuba) and a well-written and realistic storyline.
21. Lucy and Aladdin's Lamp:  Fair
22. Lucy and Carol Burnett
Classic!  Lucy is just hilarious as Marlene and Carol as Ruby.  The Hattoppers were great dancers and Lucie performs like a star in ""Mr. Bonjangles.""  ""Horray for Hollywood"", ""Chicago"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" and ""Singing in the Rain"" sound great (Lucy sings backup with the stronger voices taking the lead; nice musical direction.)  The soundstage sketch in the show and the opening parts are written with lots of laughs.
23.-24. Lucy Goes Hawaiian
Classic Lucy show.  Lucy and Viv schemes at their best to get each other's beau, who turns out to  be married!  Lucy Harry, and Viv play off excellently with each with their love/hate relationship.  The musical numbers are top notch.  Lucy and Lucie's Ukulele Talk is great; Viv's yellow bird is pretty and comical, Desi's Tiny Bubbles is classic, Lucie's hula is innocent and sensuous, Mama's Mumu is funny (I cannot believe here how much Lucy and Viv look like relatives in their build. It's hilarious to see Harry dressed as Mama Cass.) and the native dance is well choreographed.

Special Features

Lucy Meets the Burtons:  Very informative and shows some rare footage.
Make Room for Granddaddy: This shows is just hilarious!  The show is written superbly and Danny and Lucy play wonderfully off each other in a realistic storyline.  Doris Singleton and Marjorie Lord are great in spoofing the conversation between Lucy and Marjorie at the beginning of the show; and Angela has two good lines, but is little seen.  Danny sings a beautiful number as well.
Lucy with Jack Benny  A great skit spoofing Hollywood that was really funny.
Lip-Sync Lucy: It is great to see Lucy dancing and looking beautiful, but it is strange to hear her dubbed, but I was glad to know that Carole Cook dubbed her when she wanted to rehearse a dance number or her voice was weak and couldn't hit the high notes.
Lucie and Desi Jr. with Robert Young:  This skit starts out funny but turns into a dated generation gap skit that doesn't age well.
Lucy's Vault:  Desi Jr. is hilarious on House Party; it is great to see the behind scenes information on Here's Lucy; the home movies from Hawaii feature the 4 Arnazes, Viv, and Mary Wickes is fun to watch the fun they had and the beautiful scenery; the golf is okay.",1348876800,2,6006,4.669201520912548
4109317,5,B003CJXJ4A,"happier times for me, thank you for taking me there with your items i bought from you. looking to do business with you again",1324080000,,124,4.208333333333333
4109318,5,B003CJXJ4A,"Season 3 was considered by many the best of Lucille Ball's third series HERE'S LUCY.  Beginning with the star studded power of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor certainly set it off with a bang.  It's important to note that Lucille Ball was getting older and when it came to television and humour she was more on the conservative side and was having a problem with how television was becoming filled with more violence and sex.  She was proud of the morals she held strong to on her own show.  All that shows very strongly in this whole season and thus, in some ways, makes the show a little dated.

I LOVE LUCY was based on the simple relationships of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo and Fred and Ethel Mertz and had its true magic in the comedic timing and precision of the gifted Ball.  I LOVE LUCY is timeless - story lines run true today and the spot on humor is still awe inspiring.  With HERE'S LUCY we see that the franchise is still great and the main reason for this is again the comedic prowess of Ball herself.  Her bits are a little slower, they are shot from farther away but the wit, timing and class Lucy brought to her comedy is fully intact.  For me the Burton episode is a letdown for the final comedic scene when Lucy can't get the ring off is a true steal from how a similar situation was handled on I LOVE LUCY.

But I LOVE LUCY was ground breaking, history making television for so many reasons.  The fact that HERE'S LUCY was still in the top ten based on the talents and fan base of Lucille Ball shows that Lucy hereslf is also timeless.  This season we get some great guest stars and Vivian Vance graces us again for a two episode arc which is always a treat.  This season also pulls away more from Lucy and her kids and moves more towards her relationship with Harry Carter played by Gale Gordon.  Whether a Lucy fan or a fan of great comedy this season is a true must.  Here you see a true comedic artist still  in her prime.  There are many classic episodes and here you will see comedy as a true art form.  The digital remastering is superb and there are extras galore.  Highly recommend.",1298073600,2,2111,4.312182741116751
4109319,4,B003CJXJ4A,"Kicking off with what became the highest-rating show from the entire run, Season Three of HERE'S LUCY finds Lucille Ball in good form, with her usual gallery of guest stars - but none shine as brightly as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the season opener, where Lucy tries on Taylor's diamond ring-bling and cannot remove it.  Despite the star wattage of Taylor and Burton, the episode's writing is sadly very thin on the ground, and the ""one joke"" premise of the story severely limits it's range.

Things return to zany form in ""Lucy and the Diamond Cutter"", where filthy-rich eccentric Mrs. Whitmark (Ruth McDevitt) asks Carter's Unique Employment Agency to find a suitable place for a cursed ancient diamond to be discreetly cut into four smaller gems - Lucy's living room seems the perfect spot.  Wally Cox is the diamond cutter and he's an absolute scream.  And whilst we're talking screams, Lucy literally gets tied to the rack for an unexpected audition for Vincent Price's latest chiller in ""Lucy Cuts Vincent's Price"".  The problem?  She only wanted Price to give his opinion on an antique painting!

Jack Benny returns in the lavish ""Lucy and Jack Benny's Biography"", one of the season's requisite ""variety"" episodes, where Benny re-enacts his past with various women, each one played by a certain red-headed comedienne.  Filming for this particular show was especially time-consuming, and reportedly wrapped in the wee small hours of the following morning - I hope Lucy supplied coffee for the audience!  Lavish production values are also evident in ""Lucy, the Co-Ed"", in which Lucy and the kids star in a 1920's ""Good News""-esque college musical written by Harry (Gale Gordon).  Marilyn Maxwell guest stars.

Art Linkletter challenges Lucy to a $500 bet in ""Lucy Loses Her Cool"", with Harry, Mary Jane (Mary Jane Croft) and the kids all conspiring to make sure that she loses!  One of the funniest shows of the season is ""Lucy, Part-Time Wife"", in which Harry tries to fend off the advances of old childhood girlfriend Gertrude Krebs (Jean Willes) by pretending that Lucy is his *pregnant* wife!  Lucy later welcomes another visit from Viv (Vivian Vance), leading to the 2-part season finale set in Hawaii.  We're now halfway through the show's run.  Let's hope Season Four isn't too far away!

Special features: As in the two earlier seasons, MPI (with the cooperation of Lucie and Desi Arnaz Jr.) has again thrown open the Desilu archives to bring out more treasures for the fans.  Highlights include an episode from Danny Thomas' one-season wonder ""Make Room for Granddaddy"", which has a crossover appearance from Ball playing Lucy Carter.  Hopefully MPI might consider releasing the whole series one day.  There's also a vintage HERE'S LUCY commercial bump for Pepsodent with Lucie Arnaz, a rare audio excerpt of Ball interviewing Doris Day on the set of ""Do Not Disturb"" (don't forget that MPI has also released all five seasons of ""The Doris Day Show""--well worth owning!), home movies from one of Lucy's real family trips to Hawaii, with Vivian Vance and Mary Wickes; and a new featurette focusing on the Taylor/Burton episode.

4109320,5,B003CJXJ4A,"Man, MPI is keeping the good work up, I now have season 1-3, and they really outdid themselves with these releases, from the packaging, to the gorgeous remastering, you have to realize these shows are about 40 years old, and to look and sound as good as they do on here, is simply well done, I just started watching the second season last night, as I had just gotten done with season 1 (i know I'm late, but I didn't have the chance to get season 1 until recently) so of course I haven't watched this yet, but I've sampled it just to make sure that the episodes look as good as they do on seasons 1 and 2, and they do.

Another nice thing about this is the extras, you get the original syndication promos, original commercials, and theres a featurette on here about the episode 'Lucy Meets The Burtons' and is about a half hour long, THEN, you get the episode of 'Make Room For Granddaddy' with Danny Thomas, and special guest star...you guessed it, Lucille Ball, and is the complete episode, very nice MPI!

TV just isn't like this anymore, that is why it's so great that companies like CBS/Paramount and MPI and so on are releasing these season sets of our old favorite shows to watch again and relive the best years on television.

Now I hear that season 4 will be released in early 2011, I hope so!, now that I'm all caught up and have the first 3 seasons finally, I will be waiting for subsequent seasons, same with 'The Lucy Show'.

There are great extras with Jack Benny and other stars, as well as wonderful episode introductions by Lucie Arnaz, Desi Arnaz, Jr., Carole Cook, and many others.
