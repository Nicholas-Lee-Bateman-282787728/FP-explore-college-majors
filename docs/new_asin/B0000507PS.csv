1385033,4,B0000507PS,"I have to admit that I bought this series ONLY because Stephen Moyer is in it, and as usual, his performance did not disappoint.  He is a very gifted and subtle actor, and he shone as Stephen Bannerman.  I particularly liked what he did with his character's feelings about serving in World War I.
The rest of the cast was also good, in particular, Susan Hampshire, who I had not seen onscreen since The Forstye Saga. I also enjoyed seeing Jane Danson, who I know as Leanne on Coronation Street.
All in all, a good viewing experience.  This was not a BBC production and it does show a bit in the production values.  Overall, however, I am satisfied with my purchase.  Fans of British series like Upstairs, Downstairs,will definitely enjoy this.",1290384000,,743,4.641221374045801
1385034,3,B0000507PS,"Unless you are familiar with a Cockney English accent you probably will not understand some of the conversations ... particularly those of the kitchen staff.  While I am fond of many British productions, I will not purchase any more in the future unless they have English subtitles.  I should add, I am not hard of hearing.",1251849600,,323,4.75
1385035,5,B0000507PS,"Now here is a wonderful 8 part series in the style of PBS Masterpiece Theatre.  If you are fan of drama with complex charactes and endless intrigue, this is a series you will NOT want to miss.  Set is post WWI era, it is filmed beautifully with the costumes, jewelry and decor of that era.  Actors are all superb, language so fine and plot will keep wanting you see these episodes in a single sitting.",1187222400,2,401,4.32
1385036,4,B0000507PS,"As well as another Stephen Moyer's performance I've really enjoyed this one, which was the point to buy this miniseries and I can say that I am really please whith this purchase. Plus the story is great, it is a shame that Stephen  hasn't participated in the second season of The Grand, I would love to watch him in that one too. The surround sound of the DVD is perfect, it puts you into perspective of the scene your watching.",1173312000,,428,4.35
1385037,5,B0000507PS,"I purchased The Grand-Series One based purely on Amazon.com reviews and its description as I had never heard of it before. I am happy to say that I was totally entranced in the world of The Grand Hotel and its many visitors and residents.

The Grand follows the Bannerman family as they reopen their luxury Manchester hotel shortly after WWI. Be prepared for wonderful performances, exciting and unpredictable plots, and gorgeous 1920s era costumes and period decor.

The cast is superb and the characters are both complex and interesting. Stephen Moyer who plays Stephen Bannerman is absolutely gorgeous and irresistible in his role; Mark Mcgann as John's mischief-making brother Marcus is similarly excellent. Also, wonderful acting from Tim Healy as the wise, know-it-all porter Mr. Collins, and look for British costume drama veteran Susan Hampshire.

The Grand-Series One is a two-disc set, which contains eight episodes, each running around 50 minutes each. The series is addictive and I watched it in its entirety over the course of two days.

You won't be disappointed!",1149465600,6,1077,5.208092485549133
1385038,5,B0000507PS,"The Grand is an ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" type series, set in 1920's, and revolves around the owners of ""The Grand Hotel,"" their staff, and the hotel guests. Just like Upstairs/Downstairs, social station, the war, and family issues are the hot plot topics for this series. The most sympathetic characters are that of the hotel owner John, Charles' fiancee Ruth, and the servants. My only peeve with the series? That its way too short. There are only 8 episodes in the first season set which makes the price a little steep. Also, Unresolved plot threads... Such as the poor drunk girl who had the 'appendicitis' trouble. I wanted to see the villian in that ep get what he deserved. Unfortunately no resoultion. Also...As usual, the poor folks show much more spine than their snobbish and rich 'patrons,' which was a little predictable.
Still, this is an excellent series, sure to delight viewers who also like Upstairs Downstairs.",1080172800,8,925,5.012987012987013
1385039,5,B0000507PS,"How refreshing to find a drama that so well thought out. The set's look solid and true to the period , the costume's are rich
ley detailed. And the acting is fabulous and heart felt.
The story it self is also true to the era with the long suffering
staff trying hard, to keep the bannerman's and guest's in pride
and pomp. You can sense the class division witch the story play's
on a lot. As some of the staff try to break free and other's just
dream about it.the bannerman's and guest's have not got it easy
with .Mysterious strangers,tragic circumstances,illict affairs,
prostitution and murder. I think i would prefer to be a staff
member. And with a script that almost like poetry in motion.
This is good viewing with strong characters and a good story.",1069545600,4,757,4.532846715328467
1385040,4,B0000507PS,"""The Grand"" is certainly addictive -- thanks to the interesting writing and fine performances from all involved. One caveat: Initially, even the villainy is enjoyable, but by the end, the series turns quite dark and disturbing.

My personal favorites among the actors: Tim Healy is excellent as the heart of the hotel; interestingly, as his character becomes a bit looser in ""The Grand: Series Two,"" he becomes less affecting. Mark McGann is an extremely interesting villain -- he manages to keep you wondering if, in fact, there are redeeming qualities in the character. He's a scene stealer, but Julia St. John, as his love interest (and his brother's wife), more than holds her own. Rebecca Callard is extremely appealing as one of the hotel servants. Stephen Moyer invests much depth into his character of the former soldier -- it becomes apparent just how much when you view ""The Grand: Series Two,"" where his character is played by another actor of lesser caliber.

As others have mentioned, you'll soon be hooked and find it hard to stop watching until you have finished the entire series. And you'll be sure to want to check in again for ""The Grand: Series Two."" But that's the point where you might be somewhat disappointed, and not only because two characters (one mentioned above) are played by different, less-effective actors.

In the initial episodes of the second series, the tone seems off. While the first series managed to feel like drama rather than soap opera, the second dives wholeheartedly into the soapsuds and becomes more episodic. Some characters even seem to act in ways inconsistent with their previous actions. It almost feels as if a new production team had taken over, although that's not the case.

Luckily, the second series hits its stride with the fourth episode and, for the most part, sustains it until almost the very end (with some nifty surprises and plot twists along the way). There's some very enjoyable writing throughout -- great credit goes to Russell T. Davies for staying true to his period and not trying to impose modern sensibilities on his characters.

For example, the character who reveals his gayness is utterly confused and conflicted in a way that seems consistent for an uneducated worker in 1920s Britain; his self-hatred and seemingly unresolvable sense of isolation are never glossed over.

By the end of the second series, it becomes clear, though, why there were only two series of ""The Grand."" Just about every avenue of development had been explored and there was little ground left to cover with the characters. So, you check out of The Grand generally satisfied with your stay, but feel fine not returning for another.",1056931200,22,2686,4.957777777777777
1385041,5,B0000507PS,"If you are looking for a classic, you will be disappointed. This is good entertainment, classier than a soap opera,  but just about. A very clever script and great acting - I watched the entire series of 8 one-hour episodes in a single sitting.
You need to be patient for the first 20 minutes of the first episode, and then you are hooked.
This drama series is about two brothers John and Charles Bannerman who run a Hotel called ""The Grand"" and the lives of their families and staff. Charles is in love with Sarah, his brother John's wife. What we are given to undersand is that they both wooed her, and she opted for ""safe and steady"" John over the ""passion and excitement"" of Charles. When the series starts, many years have passed since John's marriage to Sarah and their have children have grown to adults, but Charles has yet to get over Sarah.
What I found refreshing was the script refrained from classifying characters as good or bad. These are ""real"" people. For the most part, no matter how selfish or self absorbed  a character is, he/she is shown to have a redeeming quality or two, while the more noble ones have their double standards or weaknesses.
I'm mid-way through Series Two. Which although good, is a let down compared to Series One. I've only just realized the apt casting of the actors who played John's son Stephen Bannerman, and Charles lover-interest Ruth, because they have been replaced by competent actors, but now these characters as played by the replacements seem flat and one-dimensional.",1055548800,8,1522,4.7180451127819545
7928785,5,B0000507PS,"This series is stellar and the story line is excellent. The problems are: (1) It was originally filmed in Spanish and so you have to deal with subtitles. Why they don't voice over, I don't know. Subtitles for a series this large is truly tedious. (2) This is only released on European DVDs which require a compatible player. However, if you are able to navigate the drawbacks, the very excellent story arcs are truly worth the time, effort and money.",1465776000,,450,4.6375

However, it simply because tiresome and did not hold my interest, I am sorry to say. I am one who loves all the Jane Austen BBC movies, etc... but this one just disappointed me.",1444348800,,317,4.112903225806452

7928793,2,B0000507PS,"I really didn't enjoy this story.  The bad brother was miscast; I found it difficult to watch or listen to him.  The story had no substance.

7928794,1,B0000507PS,"This series tries to be ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" set in a hotel. While ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" was a remarkable social history, ""The Grand"" is a very bad soap opera. In fact, it's all bad: bad writing, bad direction, and bad acting. One dimensional characters, and a plot that often makes no sense in terms of continuity among episodes. Add to that audio problems that make the volume rise and fall regularly for no reason...save your money and buy ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" instead.",1301529600,,477,5.050632911392405
