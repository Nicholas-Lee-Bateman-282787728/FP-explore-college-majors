7859005,2,6303993672,"I would recommend this episode only if you are a BIG fan of Troi or this  is one of the only episodes you have yet to collect and you want the  complete collection.
It attempts to show how Troi reacts when she loses  her biggest assest, her emphathic powers.  To me, she reacts more like a  spoiled brat than a Starfleet Officer.  She soon turns in her resignation  as she feels she can no longer do her job effectively.  In the end, of  course, she regains her powers.
Besides making a marginal character look  about as shallow as possible, the storyline that accompanies it is weak  too.  This makes my list of one of the five worst episodes of the best TV  series in history",962668800,5,677,4.32
