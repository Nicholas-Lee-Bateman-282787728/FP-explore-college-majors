8110428,4,B000EHSVK0,"Some of these comedians were very funny and you certainly get a lot of variety.  Definitely worth the cheap price.  I loved Grant Turner's innocent bystander routine and I believe Greg Travis is ""David Sleaze-Punk Magician"" from the 80's. A must watch of that skit on YouTube.",1349740800,,276,4.851063829787234
8110429,1,B000EHSVK0,"When I saw this, I thought, ""Neat, more of the ""southern comics"" I like so much.""  Wrong.....If I had been able to read the back of the DVD before purchasing, I would not have bought this. These segments are old....really old.  As in 20+ years old.  I am not happy with this item, the age of the clips should have been posted in the item discription.",1154736000,4,350,4.2727272727272725
