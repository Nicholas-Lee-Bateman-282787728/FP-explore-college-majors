3991564,5,B002UOMGX8,"The 11th season of Murder, She Wrote is just as great as the previous 10 seasons.  I wish this series could go on forever.

The set of DVDs came in a timely manner and is in pristine condition.  Thanks Amazon.",1267574400,,209,4.175
3991565,5,B002UOMGX8,"I have always admired Angela Lansbury as an actress and though we all know it is not possible for a series to never end I wish this one hadn't but we have eleven years of pure entertainment and I for one appreciate that she gave us those eleven years. I am very picky about what movies I buy and this is the only television series I have collected. My favorite episode is where they approached JB Fletcher about writing a script for a mystery show featuring a retired lady who solves crimes and she tells them it just wouldn't work and no one would watch it. I had a good laugh over that episode because it did work and we reaped the benefits. Were any of you aware that Amazon also carries the Murder, She Wrote books by JB Fletcher and Donald Bain?  They read as if you are watching an episode on TV. Thanks Amazon for carrying both and I so appreciate the prices you offer for your products.  Can't wait until the eleventh year in the series comes out.  I think a Murder, She Wrote Marathon right here in my home with a few other fans will be in order so we can raise our glasses to a lady that has more class and sophistication in her little finger than most whether it be Angela Lansbury or JB Fletcher.",1266969600,16,1208,4.220779220779221

3991567,4,B002UOMGX8,"I'm sure that Murder She Wrote was a great watch.  I have gifted
it out to some of my friends.  I remembering watching it a long
time ago (because I am getting older).  However, now I need
closed captioning and it doesn't have it.  If there are other
families who want to share it with family members or other grown
children, they should know that.  There should be something on
Amazon that tells people whether their old movies have ""closed
captioning"" on it or not.  It would save us some unnecessary
expense in this escating expensive world we live in.",1264809600,4,555,4.5
3991568,5,B002UOMGX8,"Perfect show to watch when you're recovering from an ailment.

3991619,5,B002UOMGX8,"I haven't bought this one yet, I have all the other seasons (thru 12) plus the movie collections but I live on a VERY strict budget and cannot afford this season 11, even from a private party because the price is too high.  I would love to own it.  Is there anyone out there that can tell me why this one season is so much more expensive than all the others?  I would love to know why.  I would also love to complete my collection but can't because it costs more than I can afford.  I usually pay in the $15 to $20 range (plus freight) from private parties and only buy new (still shrink wrapped)  but this one is just too expensive.  An anyone explain it?  I've given it a rating of 5 stars even though I haven't seen it because I KNOW it will be that good!",1406160000,,758,4.040268456375839

3991623,5,B002UOMGX8,"This delightful TV series came out in the 1980s and can still be seen in reruns today.  The marvelous Angela Lansbury plays Jessica Fletcher, small town Mainer and mystery novelist, (who becomes a bit more sophisticated as the series continues).  Ms. Lansbury's performance never varies - it's always excellent - as she takes her warm and appealing character through solving one murder mystery after another.  Why buy the DVDs when you can watch the show in reruns on TV?  because you can tune in any time you want - and not have to watch a single commercial.  Highly recommend the entire series or any portion thereof.",1392940800,,619,4.80188679245283

You are entertained with real life people and not some mechanized technological idiots that dance through the sceen at the whim of a computer. The viewer must always be alert to all of the facts that may uncover the real killer. Surprise endings are normal for each episode. There is always some human motivation on which the story unfolds. Angela Lansbury keeps the action going throughout each episode and is a truth seeker, not like the world we actually live in!",1390608000,,555,4.791666666666667

If there was nothing else to watch on TV and sometimes believe, there isn't ,I could watch this lady all day and night.  What a series this was and I am very sad that it had to end.  I would love to meet Angela Lansbury someday as I am sure she is as nice off screen as she is as JB Fletcher.  I loved all of her revolving characters in the show.  William Windom as Seth Haslett, Tom Bosely as Amos Tucker and Jerry Orbach who is no longer with us and that is a shame, as Harry McGraw. I have gotten to know them all.  I especially applaud Angela for casting some of our actresses and actors that we had not seen for quite some time and giving them the work which we have heard that she did.  All in all, I am still missing this wonderful show and am so glad I can watch it whenever I want on my DVDs.  Also another thing about this show  is no filthy language ever crossed the lips of these wonderful actors which is something I can't say about vehicles coming out of Hollywood today.

3991657,1,B002UOMGX8,"I bought ""Morder, She wrote"", complete season 11 from Amazon.com as a birthdaygift to my girlfriend. When it arrived 2 weeks too late, we discovered that the region codes for europe were not correct (codes that protects the movie from spreading to other regions and controls subtitle language etc.) which makes the films unusable. They can be seen on our laptop with specific programs, but it was the intention to use our big screen television. Bying this through Amazon was clearly a mistake - even an expensive one. So, please use caution before bying DVD's this way - they may be coded wrongly.",1309132800,,597,4.805825242718447
3991658,5,B002UOMGX8,Highly recommend to all ages.  Good clean TV enjoyment.  We have all 12 seasons and love watching them regularly.  Angela Lansbury is the best.,1293408000,,143,4.875

3991660,5,B002UOMGX8,"I don't know exactly what it is about MURDER SHE WROTE, but I've collected every season and pre-order the next before they even think it through! I'm sure the series is soon to end and I don't know what I'll look forward to next! When the original series ended years ago I was so depressed! J B Fletcher is a joy to watch; you can see those wheels turning and as a writer, the character is so interesting, what with all the traveling she does, a murder in every port to solve and then write about. I can't imagine a more WONDERFUL LIFE!!!  Number twelve is in the wings, but I haven't received it yet. I CAN'T WAIT!!!",1277424000,2,617,4.228813559322034

3991667,5,B002UOMGX8,Typical Jessica Fletcher. The clues are a little less noticable in this series. I wonder if it was due to time restrants. You will probably still figure most of them out. This will be a welcome addition to any Murder Mystery collection.,1269820800,10,236,4.642857142857143

Not even obstinate cops, home or abroad, can thwart Jessica when she is in the pursuit of justice.  She is almost a superhero.  Her secret weapon is the art of the bluff.  This isn't your button, I just said it was.  An inconvenient truth mentioned after a confession.

Eleven seasons and she is never wrong, friend or foe, they all get found out and summarily arrested.  Who said murder wasn't fun!",1506729600,,567,4.957446808510638
