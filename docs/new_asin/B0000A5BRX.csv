1903020,5,B0000A5BRX,"Jean Rochefort (Manesquier) and Johnny Hallyday (Milan) literally drip with screen presence. Both of these men of course have weathered and survived more than 60 years combined in the French movie business. Hallyday, in his youth was a rock star and he had a career as such, comparable to Elvis Presley.
Patrice Laconte, the director of ""The Man on the Train"" needed only to put these two in front of the camera and they would/do bring to the screen a world weary, slightly menacing, advancing screen idol charisma comparable to say Robert De Niro and Paul Newman.
Manesquier and Milan bond almost immediately when they meet. Since it is November and the hotels in Manesquier's small town are closed for the season, Manesquier invites Milan to stay with him in his home: a chateau that Manesquier had shared with his mother while he was a French Lit teacher.
Not much happens but the blossoming of a friendship between the two opposite in experience men: Manesquier, a teacher, a pianist, an appreciator of French Literature and Milan, a gun toting adventurer more prone to the seedier side of life.
The film is shot in moody blues and reds by Jean- Marie Dreujou and the visuals are first rate. There is even a Bergmanesque transferring of personalities between the two men that works probably because we are brought slowly and truthfully to that point.
Laconte has made a small, quiet film in which two men, absolutely opposite in experience and personality meet on common ground; ground on which they can relate. It is male bonding ratcheted up a notch with love and understanding for these men, their lives and their humanity.",1054771200,13,1630,4.845878136200717

Enjoy the development of the two characters as they take on more and more of the other's personality traits. And then watch as the sparks fly.
An exciting movie when all is said and done, and a welcome change from the confusing, if not sensorially overloading, Matrix or the cartoonish X-men.

1903027,5,B0000A5BRX,"... and if you compare this polished black jewel of a film with anything made in English, you'll have to recognize why they still hold the patent!

Milan, the hard silent menacing dude played by Johnny Hallyday, arrives by train in the 'deadest' small town in France, intending to rendezvous with other baddies and knock off the local bank. The local hotel is closed for the season, but Milan is taken in by Monsieur Manesquier (Jean Rochefort), a retired teacher of literature ensconced alone and lonely in a dilapidated family mansion. The two unlikely men gradually open to each other. No more details! You'd have to be there, as they say. But the acting is fabulously 'real', especially from Rochefort. The script is wry and snarly, very ""noir"" indeed. The camera work is lean and gritty, more indigo than noir since many of Milan's scenes are shot in infra-red, revealing the heat of his face and hands while rendering all else ghostly. ""Noir"" is all about mood, and this film brilliantly captures the mood of resentful resignation in both men. The ending is exactly what one knows it must be. In fact, if you don't KNOW what the ending must be by the end of the first quarter hour, and if you aren't sadly gratified when it comes, you're no true connoisseur of ""noir"" and should stick to Mel Gibson films.",1274400000,,1311,4.675324675324675

We were drawn into the story on such an emotional level.  The setting is a town in France, where a chance meeting of an outsider and a retired school teacher leads to an unusual friendship, with each longing to lead the other's life.  It is beautifully told and will remain in your memory forever.

An emblematic resemblance of two well opposite sides of he coin united by the unhappiness and existential solitude.

A film that literally captivated and engaged the members of the Jury in Venice 2002 as Bes Film and Best Actor.

1903030,4,B0000A5BRX,"This French film will keep you happily entertained for an hour and a half. It concerns two men with completely opposite life-styles who meet and then gradually come to the realisation that they would prefer the other persons life to their own. This being a French movie its all done with a style and pace that is completly different from standard Hollywood movies, so don't expect Mission Impossible III. There is one character in the film who speaks once a day at 10.00am, and when he does speak its a bit like Eric Cantona - very enigmatic!

The character Milan who leaves the train at the beginning of the film is a professional thief. The man he meets (Monsieur Manesquier) is a retired school teacher and writer of poetry. Initially Milan has nothing but contempt for the old school teacher and this leads to some funny scenes where Manesquier tries to impress Milan by working out or generally acting cool. The school teacher even goes as far as volunteering to help Milan in his up and coming bank heist.

So this won't be to everybodies taste, but if you stick with it theres a good chance you will enjoy it.",1192665600,,1116,4.575
1903031,5,B0000A5BRX,"L'Homme du Train is one of Patrice Leconte's best films, playing nicely to his strengths and never outstaying its welcome thanks to a tight running time. An arthouse success outside France but a disappointment in its home territory, it's a wistful look at life's disappointments and missed opportunities seen through the unlikely friendship of Johnny Hallyday's ageing bank robber checking out a small town bank and Jean Rochefort's retired schoolteacher who watches too many thrillers as each man sees in the other the life they could have lived had they only had the courage to try. The former monosyllabic and increasingly cautious, the latter unguardedly talkative, this odd couple make an engagingly credible friends, united by their own rapidly approaching dates with their respective fates.

In many ways its almost a small-scale modern-day Gallic working of Hugo Fregonese's melancholy 1954 Civil War Western The Raid, which saw Van Heflin's Confederate tempted to settle in the town he has come to destroy given a French thriller makeover, even retaining some Western motifs in Rochefort's Wyatt Earp fantasies. But while the ending is never in any doubt, one of the chief delights of the film is the unexpected turns it sometimes takes, never more than in a delightful scene in a bistro where Rochefort decides to take on some bad-mannered troublemakers against Hallyday's advice only to find things turning out very differently from what both men expected. Even scenes you'd expect to be played for comic disaster turn out quietly triumphant, such as Hallyday teaching one of Rochefort's private lessons for him - and actually turning out to be good at it despite never even reading the book under discussion.

It's a small film, but one that never feels like a chamber piece, and even if it slightly overplays its finale as each man briefly gets their wish, its small pleasures and genuine affection for its characters more than compensate. Sadly, unlike the French DVD, this release is barebones and devoid of extras, but the film itself is reason enough to buy.",1187481600,,2075,5.1

The hotel is closed, the thief and his headache wind up at the teacher's big old family house.  Days pass. One laconic, one loquacious, each is ever more drawn to the other's life.  Saturday approaches; each prepares and subtly prepares the other for the approaching personal crossroads.  And for both Saturday goes terribly wrong but brings one last shared miraculous moment and vision to move each man beyond what his life before has been.  Meticulously acted by Jean Rochefort and a weary Johnny Halladay and tensely quiet until its jarring conclusion, Man on a Train retains its grip long after the final credits.",1143331200,3,710,4.8347107438016526
1903035,5,B0000A5BRX,"We imagine ourselves to have free will, but most humans follow a trajectory set for them by society, family, circumstances.  While possible to alter his fate, an individual will rarely put forward the strenuous effort to do so.

In ""Man on the Train"", two apparently different men meet by odd chance in a small town in France.  One, Milan, is a rugged, tough criminal, an adventurer, a ""doer"".  The other, Manesquier, is a frail, provincial retired school teacher...a dullard, a dreamer.  Despite these differences, both men are weary of their lives, their destinies, to which they seem tethered like oxen to cart.

Milan dislikes his rootless life of crime.  Manequier is bored with his predictable, provincial life.  The two meet at a time when mortality confonts each one.  The criminal intuits that an apparently easy bank robbery could be dangerous.  The school-teacher will undergo triple-bypass surgery.  Death provides the impetus and the serendipitous encounter provide the opportunity for the two men to shirk their fates momentarily and live the life they dream. Milan can be a comfortable ""bourgeois de campagne"" and Manequier, a roaming daredevil.

In the end, both men, whose lives seem so divergent, meet the same fate.  One remembers, while viewing this film,  Heidegger's instructions on the importance of keeping death present in our mind, if we are to lead complete lives.  The two heroes of this story-at least briefly-accomplish this.  Johny Hallyday (Milan) turns out to be a much better actor than pop-star in this thought-provoking, nuanced film.",1118448000,27,1570,5.195219123505976
1903036,4,B0000A5BRX,"Man on the Train tells the story of two men who come to meet by chance, and in talking with one another, each begins to wonder if maybe he would be happier with the life of the other man. This is a French film and the pace is slow at times, but the conversations of these men bristle with emotion and humor, and by the time their respective appointments occur at the end of the film, they have both become quite likeable.

An aging bank robber (Johnny Hallyday) arrives by train in a small town for an easy heist, and his first order of business is to go to a drug store for some aspirin. He runs into a retired poetry teacher (Jean Rochefort), who invites him over to his place so that the thief can have a glass of water with his medicine. The teacher, seemingly lonely in his huge old house, tries to strike up conversation, but the thief is reluctant at first. Soon, though, the teacher has invited the thief to stay at his house while he's in town. Coincidentally, they both have appointments at 10:00 on Saturday: the teacher is scheduled for heart surgery, and the thief is scheduled for a robbery.

As they talk, the teacher seems to know what the thief does even before he tells him. He's snooped around and seen his guns, and tried on his leather jacket. The teacher asks prying questions, implying how exciting he thinks the thief's lifestyle is. He seems to have regrets about living a tame life. The thief, meanwhile, is quite impressed with the teacher's quiet life, in a secluded mansion in a small town. He asks if he can borrow a pair of slippers, and the teacher gladly complies. It seems like such a mundane thing, but to a thief, the mundane is out of the ordinary. The teacher says that he would love to come and help the thief out with his robbery, but his previous engagement with the surgery precludes him from doing so. The final scenes use visual poetry in lieu of words, and it's probably better that way.

There is nothing terribly flashy about Man on the Train, but it has a kind of quiet beauty to it. It sucks the viewer into its story, which is simple, but filled with character quirks that make each one of these men much more than their chosen profession. You hardly ever think about an aging thief regretting his past and wishing for a boring life, but I suppose it happens, probably just as often as a person who has lived a boring life wishes for something more dramatic. For the few days that these men become acquaintances, each gets a glimpse of the other side.",1111968000,6,2501,4.409090909090909
1903037,4,B0000A5BRX,"This film was beautifully shot and skillfully written.  The miserable dampness of the stranger (getting locked out of a hotel and sitting in the cold) juxtaposed with the warmth and charm of the elegantly appointed french chateau and the chattiness of the elderly french gentleman set up a wonderful theme - home and meaning and relationships vs. traveller (up to no good) who rarely spoke.  The fact that each yearned for a piece of each other's lives was done deftly.  The ending, however, was a bit bogged down in over-the-top death images.  Overall, though, a lovely movie.",1105488000,4,577,4.917525773195877
1903038,3,B0000A5BRX,"This French film about the unlikely friendship of two men, one a poetry teacher, the other a thief, won multiple awards. On one viewing it's a bit difficult to see why. Certainly the performances of the two leads (Jean Rochefort, Johnny Hallyday) are beyond reproach--Hallyday in particular has a striking screen magnetism. The underlying subtext about the way men live their lives and their desires, as they age, for something other than what they have is presented in an understated but clear fashion. As the two men head for their respective destinies there are some insightful scenes--a sharp dialogue between Rochefort and his estranged sister is particularly telling. Still, it all doesn't add up to much beyond the central aphorism, and the conclusion, at once shocking and confusing, seems out of keeping with the rest. ""Man on the Train,"" in sum, is interesting without being truly memorable.",1104624000,3,901,5.136054421768708
1903039,5,B0000A5BRX,"These are the kind of movies that really only the French can do justice to. Two completely disparate lives are thrust into a situation where each years for the full life of the other, one is a sedate retired teacher in a small village in the French countryside, the other, a hardened but also aging thief and bank robber.

The movie is a slow and meandering story, like I said only the French can do this and maintain the viewers interest, as we watch both men inexorably going towards a life changing even. The sedate teacher wanting to live the last years of his life in a 'devil may care' manner on his way to major bypass surgery, and the bank robber doing one of his last jobs and just wanting to be left alone in an old house in a sedate village .....

1903042,4,B0000A5BRX,"If you think this film is a thriller, something like a caper film, you had better think about choosing different films.  'Man on the Train' is a good character study about two guys who accidentally meet in an unnamed local town in France.  The film unites two unique talents, Jean Rochefort and Johnny Hallyday; it's like the union of Ben Kingsley and John Travolta, and it works.

The story is simple, as is the case with this prolific French film director Patrice Leconte.  Milan visits a small town in autum, where he finds the local hotel closed.  He finds a kind old man Manesquier, who was a teacher of poetry there.  Milan, clad in leather jacket and carrying loaded guns, has something to do in this town, while Manesquier in suit has been living in this uneventful place for a long, long time.

Between them, we see a kind of friendship begins.  The two men, so different to each other, is attracted to the other's life, which they could have lived in another time or place.  So the laconic Milan teaches the old teacher to shoot guns, who dreams of living a life of gunslinger in Toomstone, while in return the old teacher recites some poems which the visiting guest happens to remember, only partially.

The subtle relations between the two, who will not meet each other again after the coming Saturday, are the film's strength, and though the story is silm, and the pace is slow, the film draws you into the small, but delicately realized world of the two guys, who wish something, and who know that they won't get it.

Jean Rochefort, regular of Leconte films, gives superb acting as an aging teacher, who quietly accepts the reality around him.  (And M. Rochefort appeared in this film, after the disease that virtually killed Terry Gillium's film.  See 'Lost in LaMancha.')  Equally good is Hallyday, who expresses the menace behind the silent pose of Milan, who must have seen nasty things too much.

See this as a good portrayal of two men, who wouldn't meet each other in normal situation -- retired teacher and man from underworld -- but in Leconte that happens in a convincing way.  I think 'Girl on the Bridge' is his best, but 'Man on the Train' is nearly as good as that.

You see Maurice Chevit as barber, and it is a slight reference to Leconte's earlier film 'The Hairdresser's Husband' in which Rochefort and Chevit appear.",1093651200,6,2350,4.63768115942029
1903043,2,B0000A5BRX,"Man on the Train is a slow moving French movie about two men from different worlds whose lives cross one day in a pharmacy.  The movie fails on several levels to invoke any interest for these two dull underdeveloped characters.

In a sleepy provincial French town, a drifter exits a train and walks into a pharmacy looking for aspirin.  The man's behavior and demeaner invokes images of Charles Bronson from the Deathwish movies, quiet, introverted, stoic, but intensely aware.  On the way out he is approached by an older man who is his opposite; gregarious, extroverted, and obviously looking to make a friend.  Our drifter, Milan, is played by French rock and roll legend Johnny Hallyday.  The old man, Manesquier is played by another French icon, Jean Rochefort, a man with over 5 decades in French film.

Manesquier invites Milan over to get some water to wash down his aspirin.  The shallow characterizations are quickly established in their meeting.  Manesquier is talkative and eager to make a friend with this intriguing stranger.  Milan wants nothing to do with conversation and is soon on his way out the door.  However, Milan finds the only hotel in town closed so he is quickly back at Manesquier's beautiful house seeking room and board.  The old man is more that happy to put him up for a week.

From here on the movie drags as we slowly learn of Milan's upcoming bank robbery and Manesquier's inevitable surgery.  Both, coincidentally, scheduled to take place on the same day and time.  Manesquier is curiously intrigued by his new houseguest and begins to express his desire of changing his drab existence into something exciting and dangerous.  He tries to confront two obnoxious patrons of a local restaurant and, later, secretly tells Milan of his longtime fantasy to knock off the local bank where he has an account.  It makes his adrenaline surge just thinking about it.  All the while, Milan listens stoicly with seeming indifference.  It becomes apparent he has lost heart for his current lifestyle.  However, I found myself indifferent to either character's journey.

The main problem is that the character development is non-existent, the backstory is undeveloped, and their objectives are very weak.  Instead of a facsinating character story, we are left with watching a slow moving story of two boring men.  The result has the audience asking, ""Why do I care about these characters?""  The answer was that I simply didn't care at all.  And I cared less about what was going to happen to them.  Neither character made me sympathize with their story and the story was devoid of any central conflict.

The climax  occurs when the big day for both arrive.  Milan at last goes to rob his bank and Manesquier has his surgery.  There is rising suspense as these two stories are juxataposed and we are left on the edge of our seats wondering whether each character will live or die.

In the resolution both characters are effected more than they were aware of by the other.  It leaves them with the realization that for a brief time they really wanted to live the other's life.",1091750400,7,3096,4.838095238095238

Knowing of Hallyday only as a French pop star, I wasn't sure what to expect in the way of acting.  I was very pleasantly surprised by his skill and ability, and found his character very compelling.

Monsieur Manesquier (Jean Rochefort) is a solitary retired schoolteacher who desires some type of companionship when he first encounters a rough-looking younger Milan (Johnny Hallyday) buying aspirin in the chemist shop. After starting a conversation outside on the deserted street Manequier ascertains that Milan just arrived by train and is looking for a place to stay. The other details of his stay regarding robbing a bank Milan keeps hidden, but not for long. Manequier invites Milan to stay at his house that is filled with antiques and old books. As time progresses these two men grow a mutual fondness for each other and envy the life that the other has led. They don't hesitate to critique and romanticize each other to the point where they begin to adopt each other's characteristics. Manequier offers to help Milan in the bank robbery while Milan takes over tutoring students in poetry and literature. Their lives become intertwined and linked. MAN ON THE TRAIN is a wonderful film filled with sincere emotions and subtle humor.

The quiet story of how two wholly opposite aging men meet, interact, exchange philosophies, and mutate because of a simple chance meeting is not only fine writing, it is also a virtuoso turn for the talents of Jean Rochefort and Johnny Hallyday.  Rochefort is a loquacious, bored, congenial poetry teacher in semi-retirement, a man who not only loves to talk about Schumann but plays Schumann on his piano in his very old and boring house - and reads and readies himself for a weekend surgery.  Hallyday (a dark, sinister long term burglar) stops off the train in Rochefort's village, meets the talkative Rochefort and ends up taking up residence with him.  Their interactions, soliloquies, shared meals, and exchanges on walks all prove mutually enlightening.  The ending is so dear that to place it in a review would be a crime (!).

1903051,5,B0000A5BRX,"I've seen every major release and a great deal of the minor and independent releases as well in 2003.  Unfortunately I don't live on the coasts where every movie gets a release, so I can only go by what gets released here.  I can say without any doubt, ""L'Homme Du Train"" was the best thing I saw in a movie theatre in 2003.
You would think that a movie about two older men contemplating life for an hour and a half would be a boring snore; but not this one.  Patrice Leconte has created electricity between his two leads, Rochefort and Hallyday.  By simply putting them on the screen together, there's comedy, there's depth, there's respect, there's an electricity that simply radiates from their screen-presence.  When Rochefort finds an old picture of Hallyday and smiles, it's almost as if we are seeing a man finding a picture of his long-lost brother.
Surprisingly, the movie is funny.  There are plenty of moments to laugh at, the best being when Hallyday speaks plainly for his companion when he tells his girlfriend, ""He wants tenderness and sex - not news of your brat.""  Another hilarious moment is when Rochefort puts on Hallyday's leather jacket and pretends to be Wyatt Earp in the mirror.  It reminds you of how far the two leads are from each other, and what an exceptional occurence it is for these two men to simply talk and understand each other.
The ending is bold.  Very bold; I remember sitting in the theatre asking myself, ""Does this movie have the guts to end like this?"" and sure enough it did.  Too many movies surrender to a formulaic resolution, or take the easy route, but this movie heads off down between the trees forging it's own path.  Exactly what happens?  Do they swap identities?  Do they simply trade places?  Is there a greater leap?  The answer has got to be there.
Update on February 22:  Interesting to see that the Oscars have basically ignored this movie altogether.  It gets nothing in the Foreign Language film category, and nothing at all in the screenplay categorie.  Now, I'm unsure as to the schedule on when movies are released/eligibility for Oscars are, but this movie has gone unrecognized by the Academy, and I think that is a glaring shame.  This movie has nothing to do with revolutions, or third-world countries, or obscure historical figures, or higher socio-political implications that seem to get all the attention.  Is it really a requisite that a film pander to any of these categories before it can be recognized?  Must a film shape itself to a list of ""worthy"" and ""unworthy"" subject matter; and if not, why all the attention?  It seems to me the Academy is forgetting itself in forgetting this movie.  I still maintain this was the best movie of 2003, and have just about lost all my trust in the Academy to pick the true winners.",1073347200,5,2798,4.66530612244898
1903052,3,B0000A5BRX,"The premise of this movie is that two men (a bank robber and a retired poetry teacher) wind up hanging out together for a few days and discover that each wishes his life had been more like the other's. It's a decent set-up for a film, but the actual movie lacks a sense of authenticity. For one thing, the retired poetry teacher's life is simply too dull to believe that ANYONE would envy him. The guy seems to have no friends, nothing to do with his time... he is the most bored, lonely person on the planet. Women are indifferent to him and even buying a baguette is too challenging for him.
The robber, on the other hand, is the cool, silent type. So silent, in fact, that we never really get to know him. If he hates the lifestyle so much, why is he living it? What is it about the teacher's life that appeals to him, really?
Finally, the ending is rather trite and predictable.
I think the main problem I have with this movie, though, is that the characters serve the plot, rather than the plot stemming from the characters. There's no sense of authenticity to either man; they're both complete stereotypes. The film itself is so utterly contrived to establish the symmetry of the two men, each of whom wishes his life were more like the other's, that there's no room for more personal, authentic moments.
I generally enjoy foreign films because they tend to have more depth than the average Hollywood movie, but ""Man on the Train"" just didn't do it for me. Just because a movie is slow and sub-titled doesn't make it ""art.""",1070928000,9,1529,4.464285714285714
1903053,5,B0000A5BRX,"Johnny Hallyday and Jean Rochefort are superb in what is for all intents and purposes a two-person movie.  But between those two, what drama!  And comedy!!  You'll laugh at some very smart and well-staged moments crafted by director Patrice Leconte.
Hallyway - face weathered (and perhaps somewhat distorted from plastic surgery) - is career criminal Milan. Rochefort - slight and sedantary - is retired linguistics teacher Manesquier.  Through chance meeting, their lives cross.  Each slowly admires the other's life choices:
- Manesquier takes a stealthy turn as Wyatt Earp in Milan's leather jacket
- Milan tries on slippers for the first time
- Manesquier fires Milan's pistol
- Milan gives a surprised boy his weekly Balzac lesson
The ending threw me for a loop.  After 85 minutes or so of life in a small French city, the last five minutes can catch you off guard.  What is Leconte doing here?  Are the characters actually...???(don't want to reveal here).  Unlike ""Swimming Pool,"" you get it sorted out pretty quickly.  It's a shocking but satisfying ending.
I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",1070841600,6,1109,5.077348066298343
1903054,5,B0000A5BRX,"Opening sequence: Street wise world weary traveling man Hallyday rides a train into a quiet French town one morning and while strolling the desolate streets he meets retired poetry professor Jean Rochefort. The two strike up a friendship and since the towns only hotel is closed for the season Rochefort invites Hallyday to spend a few days at his family home where he lives by himself. At first the two say very little but each is fascinated with the others life which is so different from his own. Rochefort is charming and sad and lonely and he finds the roaming Hallyday  to be everything that he is not. Hallyday in turn finds something alluring about the ex-professors sedentary life. Rochefort suspects Hallyday is in town to do a heist and he is envious that he can't live such a life.
It is a film about an unusual friendship that develops between two men who find they are nearing the end of their days and are thus looking at life with a wistful combination of mild wonder and regret.  Certain small moments sum up the kind of life each man has lived. Hallyday tries a pair of slippers on for the first time in his life and Rochefort in turn fires a gun for the time in his.  The men seem to recognize something in each other from the first time they meet and after three days together it is as if they have forged the deepest bond they have ever known.  But the day of Hallydays big heist arrives and on this day Rochefort is due to go under the knife for a heart ailment. Leconte cuts between the operating room and the bank as these two men face down what may be their final hour. Each man thinks about the other and in the last minutes of the film we see each man finding comfort in  picturing  himself living the others life. Fascinating well-handled final sequence.
This is a noir in the way it contemplates how mens fates are decided for them. But the fact that their fates are out of their hands does not discount each mans ability to imagine how it all could have been otherwise.

1903055,4,B0000A5BRX,"A stranger arrives in a sleepy French town with plans to rob its bank. The man is Milan (Johnny Hallyday), an aging and world-weary career criminal. When he discovers that the town's hotel is closed, an elderly gentleman invites Milan to stay in his home. The elderly man is Monsieur Manesquier (Jean Rochefort), a retired literature teacher whose life has always been routine, and now the routine is spent mostly alone in his family's lovely but somewhat dilapidated mansion. As these two men spend time observing each other, each man is drawn by curiosity to the other man's lifestyle. They both begin to see long-dormant aspects of their own characters in the other man. As their growing friendship induces in each man a new way of seeing himself, the two men develop a taciturn but deep bond.

""The Man on the Train"" is a stereotypical French film in that nothing actually happens overtly. The action is all internal, in the hearts and minds of Milan and M. Manesquier. It is less typical of a French film in that not much is said either. Milan is a laconic character, and M. Manesquier likes to talk but seems to lack anyone to talk to. This is a quiet film that actually seems to distrust language. The story of these two unlikely companions discovering each other in themselves is told through two sensitive, outstanding performances by Jean Rochefort and Johnny Hallyday and through the cinematography of Jean-Marie Dreujou. I could have done with less filtration on some of the outdoor scenes, but Dreujou's cinematography really shines inside M. Manesquier's mansion. The camera work gives the audience the distinct impression of a closed, isolated space in which we are concealed observers of the unusual relationship that is developing between the two men. Fans of character studies will appreciate this little gem of a film. If that's you, ""The Man on the Train"" is highly recommended. French with English subtitles. There are no bonus features on the DVD, and the subtitles cannot be turned off.",1070064000,3,2009,4.908823529411765
1903056,5,B0000A5BRX,"""Man on the train"", directed by Patrice Leconte is ""intimiste"" French cinema at its best.
It tells the story of a chance encounter and ensuing friendship between Milan, a gangster who is coming to a small French town to rob a bank and Manesquier, a retired professor of poetry who has lived there his whole life.
The two protagonists could not be more different and yet, each one becomes fascinated by the other's life.
Soon, Milan tries on slippers and Manesquier is shooting a gun at soda cans.
Was Milan's life wasted because he never had the strength to fill his life with the structure he so desires?
Was Manesquier's life wasted because he never had the strength to escape the structured life he so loathes?
Will they go all the way and actually exchange lives?
The movie is extremely well directed and photographed, with grainy blueish colors that support each character's melancholy.
The script is tight and leaves room for silent moments which are as important to the story as the dialogue (a concept unknown in Hollywood). Every word has a deeper meaning than its litteral one. In one of the best scenes of the movie, the elegant poetry professor Manesquier puts on Milan's leather jacket and stands in front of the mirror saying in English: ""The name is Earp...Wyatt Earp"".
But in the end, what makes the movie such a gem is the talent of the two lead actors who, like their characters, are such extreme opposites that their screen relationship could easily have ended up devoid of any chemestry.
Jean Rochefort is an intellectual and one of France's greatest and most subtle living actors.
Johnny Hallyday is the uneducated, over-the-top rock'n roll singer and social icon who has monopolized the #1 spot in French music charts since 1960 and who has been derided by the French intelligentsia ever since.
Until the movie, Rochefort himself was no fan of Hallyday, though he likes to say with a grin: ""Madame Rochefort, on the other hand..."". They have since become friends.
It, reportedly, took a lot of effort by Rochefort and Leconte to make Hallyday comfortable enough to act opposite Rochefort whom he saw as a towering icon.
They most certainly succeeded since, in the end, it is the surprising subtelty of Hallyday's performance that makes the movie so poignant.
Despite the botox injections and the face lifs, his Mount Rushmore face looks like that of a man who has been to hell and back a few hundred times. He has such presence and charisma that you can't take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen.
Though he plays Milan with a minimalist approach, both in demeanor and delivery, he manages to display the most intense emotions in a simple grin, a gesture or a stare. The way he smokes Manesquier's pipe while explaining Balzac's ""Eugenie Grandet"" (which he has obviously never read) to a private student of Manesquier will make you chuckle. The way he looks at Manesquier when he leaves his house at the end of the movie will simply break your heart...
""Man on the train"" is a gentle, tender film which asks big questions in little ways. Let's pray it never gets remade in Hollywood...",1068076800,7,3123,4.763837638376383
1903057,4,B0000A5BRX,"Patrice Leconte (The Girl on the Bridge) does a solid job over ninety one minutes of this film which is essentially about ageing and the imminent approach of death.
  Milan played by Johnny Hallyday claims to have been a stuntman for fourteen years but has now turned to robbing banks.
He arrives, by train, into a small town and needs a place to stay while preparing for one more heist.  As the local hotel is closed a chance meeting with M. Manesquier (Jean Rochefort) leads to his acceptance of the latter's hospitality.  Manesquier who is scheduled for heart surgery is at the point of examining his life which has been spent sedately as a teacher of literature and living quietly at his large and now rundown estate.  Milan is also having doubts about his own tawdry past and though he speaks little the ravages show in his gaunt face and rigid bearing.  Hallyday is perfect for this role and Rochefort, the more experienced actor,needs all of his considerable skills in what is probably the more difficult assignment.
  An unlikely but genuine friendship blossoms between the two men and though the outcome is highly predictable the dialogue and interaction between them  never misses.  Both see in the other what they have missed or neglected in their own lives and begin to explore each other and their possessions. Milan recalls parts of a poem he once learned while his host shoots at a row of cans.  In one of the most memorable scenes Milan is jostled in a bistro, does nothing, but points out to a surprised Manesquier that one man only beats two in the movies and adds a bitter reference to his own age.  Manesquier attempts to right the situation but finds that the ruffian is a former student who likes him.
  Women play a small but essential role in this film and Milan's partners are stereotypical but effective in their parts as old friend, betrayer and numbskull.
  Leconte uses some grainy and blue black techniques to create a somewhat ethereal effect in filming and the final scene is juxtaposed at times unevenly but ultimately successfully enough to leave the viewer reflecting on the relationship which has preceded and dominated the film.
  This is probably a man's film but anyone old enough to agonize about lost opportunities and roads not travelled will grasp what Leconte has been able to achieve.  Memorable..",1063324800,4,2342,4.795511221945137
1903058,5,B0000A5BRX,"Like many French films, this one draws in many timeless themes.
The Road Not Taken
We have the issue of the road not taken - the question `What if?' hangs over both the main characters from start to finish. Manesquier has led a comfortable if not entirely satisfying life for half a century in a quiet village.  However, he has his dreams, dreams of action.  Milan perhaps didn't dream of much until he saw that stability was possible - there were places in the world where doors were left unlocked, and strangers were welcomed.
Opposites Attract
There is also the issue of opposites attracting, and the basic feature of human nature of wanting what we don't have - the-grass-is-always-greener syndrome. Manesquier is intrigued by the mysterious drifter Milan; the more he learns, the more eager he is to adopt his recklessness. Manesquier, on the other hand, has stability and subtle concerns that Milan has not experienced, and which provide a tempting sweetness.  The poem Manesquier is teaching his young charge near the beginning of the film warns against complacency in sweetness; Milan understands this, even has he adopts Manesquier's lifestyle so thoroughly as to become the new tutor to the student.
The Odd Couple
Manesquier and Milan are a classic odd couple.  One is educated, the other is not.  However, the uneducated Milan is not unintelligent, and has a poet's soul.  The perhaps-overeducated Manesquier, on the other hand, longs for the recklessness of a cowboy who fires pistols and dresses in leather jackets with fringe. Manesquier teaches Milan to eat proper meals and look for deeper meanings in feelings and poetry; Milan gives Manesquier the experience of firing a handgun, plotting a bank robbery (which Manesquier confesses has been a fantasy for 30 years) and expressing his true feelings toward others.
Little Things Mean A Lot
Manesquier is taken by little things in Milan's behaviour and being.  Milan is mysterious, a great change from the changeless pattern of life in the sleepy provincial French village.  His leather jacket, his ability to swig cognac, even his vocal patterns - these intrigue Manesquier.  The simple things of Manesquier's life - wearing slippers, having a bath, smoking a pipe - are beyond Milan's tempestuous existence, and Milan yearns for more normalcy.
The More Things Change...
At the start of the film, one can be forgiven for believing that Manesquier is the coward, the one resistant or even afraid of change.  Yet we come to understand also that Milan, the drifter, the thief, the impervious one, is also afraid to change, even when it is offered freely, as in Manesquier's offer of money instead of the robbery.  Milan rejects it.  He is as trapped by his life as is the poet Manesquier; ironically, one comes to see that Manesquier is more open to change - his scene in the restaurant attempting to start a fight attests to this, but the courage to change has come late in life, perhaps too late. Manesquier is very brave to take in the stranger Milan in the first place, the first indication that he's ready to change.  Yet, things remain the same.  Even as Milan and Manesquier grasp aspects of each other's lives (such as Milan shaving his goatee to look more like Manesquier, and Manesquier getting a haircut to look like Milan), things remain the same.
The Essence of French Cinema
It is almost essential to the best of French films that they have enigmatic endings, and this film fulfills that task.  Do Manesquier and Milan trade places or not?  Both are grasping at hope that seems to be embodied in the other, but neither quite attainable.
The cinematography is a bit grainy and dark, just as the cloud hanging over the characters is likewise grainy and dark.  The sets are perfect accompaniment to the characters - tattered elegance for the poet, and stark plain-ness for the drifter. Manesquier is performed by Jean Rochefort, and Milan is performed by Johnny Hallyday, who give perfectly complementary performances, establishing their own identities and then losing them in each other quickly as the drama progresses.
Not much of physical substance happens in the film until near the end; rather, the change is spiritual and psychological, with most of the `action' taking place in conversation and nuanced scenes of metamorphosis.
Director Patrice Leconte has produced a minor gem here.",1058486400,9,4365,4.9739010989010985
1903059,4,B0000A5BRX,"This is a quintessential French film, which in this case adds to the charm and the attraction. And the action is so leisurely that the subtitles are not a problem or distraction although in some instances they are not well timed or seem to be incomplete. The story begins with THE MAN ON THE TRAIN, Milan (played by Johnny Halladay) arriving in a small French town dressed in a black motorcycle jacket and carrying a case that includes three handguns among his possessions. His character projects a sense of foreboding, and we soon learn that he and some associates are planning to rob a local bank. Meanwhile, he has engaged in a chance encounter with Manesquier (Jean Rochefort), a retired schoolteacher. Milan essentially invites himself to stay at Manequier's estate when he discovers that the local hotel is closed. They are opposites in every way, Milan is gruff and his presence augurs a sense of danger and potential misfortune; Manesquier is genteel, a retired schoolteacher and gentleman of such ordinary habits that he has eaten lunch in the same local restaurant every day for thirty years. Somehow, a poignant friendship develops as they each see in the other the road not taken in their lives. Yet, they and the moviegoers realize that it is probably too late to change the inevitabilty of the events already set in motion.
The charm of the film is its leisurely pace and the attention to detail. We are constantly treated to small surprises and unexpected twists that allow for wonderful character development. Once such example is when Milan tutors a student who appears in Manesquier's absence in the study of Balzac. The performances are captivating, and since I was unfamiliar with either of the leads they totally assumed the roles in which they had been cast. Once I had adjusted to the slow pace of the story and the director's style, I was completely capitivated.
The film is approximately an hour and a half in length, enough time to get to know the characters and for the story to build to it's conclusion with increasing tension and suspense during the final phases but tightly enough edited not to become bogged down in details. The only drawback was that I thought that I was prepared for almost any possible conclusion but am not at all sure how to interpret the ending to this film . I can come up with several possible imterpretations, but can't discuss them without revealing too much of the plot. Maybe it would be clear to me if I saw the film again, but despite remembering it quite vividly and clearly and going over it repeatedly in my mind I am not sure what conclusion to draw. I notice that several other reviewers had the same reaction, so felt that it was appropriate to emphasize this aspect of the film in my review but strongly recommend it with this caveat. This is a film for moviegoers who like interesting stories and characters rather than intense action. It examines in the context of an interesting story the questions that inevitably arise in each of our lives about the road not taken and the role of fate.",1057708800,33,3060,4.7322097378277155

In the short time they have before their mutual appointments with fate, they attempt to walk in each other's shoes (in one case literally) and each discover the secret of the other's world.

I'd never seen either actor before, not surprising since I don't generally see French cinema, but both were very good. The Man we see on the Train at the beginning of the movie is a mysterious fellow who is rather like Charles Bronson. Pure chance brings him in contact with a Man from the Town, an older stay-at-home gent who is rather like old Danny Kaye.
