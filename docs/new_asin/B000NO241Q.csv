2772886,5,B000NO241Q,"Overall a solid set with some interesting games from the 90's.  The only thing I wish they had done with this is they could've put in games such as the game he got his 3000th hit, 400th home run, the 1991 All-Star game in which he was MVP, or even game 5 of 1983 World Series in the Orioles victory over Philly.",1211155200,6,311,4.016129032258065
2772887,5,B000NO241Q,"I can't believe nobody has reviewed this..so an old southern californian  will take the lead for the millions of baseball fans  and  those in  Baltimore and let rip.

This set has flab..whenever you have complete games that aren't world series games there are things you don't  want to watch over and over...so the DVDs of Cal's multi-hit affairs aren't something  I will revisit too often.  But..there are so many classic moments that make this a MUST for any true baseball fan.

The complete game where he eclipsed Lou Gehrig is wonderful and reminds me how I felt at the time and how Cal almost singlehandedly returned baseball back to prominence after the horrible strike.  The All star game is also terrific fun and the bonus disc with an hour documentary on Cal and multiple highlight clips from 3,000th hit to 400th homer etc etc is very cool.

If I had a son I'd  want  him to watch this to understand what baseball is really about and  what class and  work ethic and grace are...",1206576000,11,988,4.597701149425287

2772914,3,B000NO241Q,"If you are a Ripken fan or a baseball purest this collection is worth owning for the record breaker game at Camden Yards. Also the 2001 All-Star Game is a nice piece. The balance of the set is average at best. However, at the bargin prices on Amazon it is worth adding to the collection.",1236038400,2,287,4.236363636363636
2772915,2,B000NO241Q,"Well, now I have to say that almost all of these MLB/A&E DVD sets are at least very good.  Sure, there's the 2131 game.  But other than that, there isn't much worth watching more than once.  Maybe the three home-run game and the documentary.  Unless you're a Cal fan or really want to see the record-breaking game, take a pass.",1223942400,5,327,4.4
2772916,1,B000NO241Q,"Wonderful - All Baltimore fans should get this collection series - Really any baseball fans should get this - It's as trip down memory lane when baseball was played by dedicated players and we most likely, will never see this record broken in our lifetimes! Go Ironman!! Thanks for the memories- when baseball was the American sport!!",1217548800,,334,4.87719298245614

8179799,5,B000NO241Q,"I'm not sure why there is not much reviews on this set of DVD. If you are a true Orioles fan this is a perfect gift that will be cherished. This was a Christmas present for my husband, even I enjoyed watching it with him. I cannot wait to share with my dad when we visit. The first CD really goes into detail about Cal Ripken Jr's life. The classic games is a very huge plus, and comentary. It brought back a lot of great memories for my family.",1516233600,,445,4.01123595505618

8179801,4,B000NO241Q,"This is a great DVD for Baltimore Orioles or Cal Ripken fans.

It includes a documentary (that could be longer) that was produced when Cal Ripken retired in 2001 as well as five complete games - 2131, Cal's 3 HR game in Seattle in 1996, his six hit game in Atlanta in 1999, and his final All Star Game in which he won the MVP in 2001.

The inclusion of Game 1 of the 1996 ALDS seemed a bit random.  Other than the fact that it's the first post season game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, there's really nothing significant to Cal Ripken here.  One would think a game from earlier in Cal's career could've been included.  Perhaps the clincher from the 1983 World Series where Cal caught the final out?  Or the 1991 All Star Game, his first All Star MVP.

Maybe in lieu of complete games, they could've done a bonus disc or two of just highlights, but for the price you really can't go wrong.  Plus, you do get some rare footage of Will Clark in an Orioles uniform.",1516147200,,963,4.224043715846994

8179807,5,B000NO241Q,"Love this, some great games if you're a fan of the Iron Man, or indeed of the Orioles of the 90's. Well worth the watch. Documentary was also a great accompaniment to the games and informative. My only complaint is that there aren't more sets like this. Of Cal, All Star games from the past (Would LOVE to see the 93 one again. Randy Johnson vs John Kruk!) and many many more.",1411257600,,376,4.236111111111111
