6877495,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"A great film. Well acted and executed. Clearly a small budget, but it has a lot of great moments in it. The director and stars are people to watch in the coming years.",1426550400,5,167,4.090909090909091

6877504,2,B00QR1JZ3O,"The story is kind of interesting but I can't get over the fact that they just gloss over some things in the plot.  The girl has really nice adoptive parents and she set fire to their house for no reason.  The filmmakers just gloss over it and act like she did nothing wrong.  A more realistic reaction would have been anger, and then punishment for Eve.",1484092800,2,353,4.318181818181818
6877505,2,B00QR1JZ3O,"It is a slow moving movie.  Interesting enough, but I'm glad I didn't have to pay extra for it.  I give it 2 stars because I made it all the way through.  I wouldn't watch it again.",1481846400,,181,3.8378378378378377
6877506,5,B00QR1JZ3O,"I decided to watch this movie on the basis of its high ratings. As I watched it I thought, what did those people see in it to rate it so high, but I decided to watch the whole thing. I'm glad I did because now I get it. Someone said it was implausible, maybe so, but that's not the point of the story. Think about it.",1481328000,,317,3.8181818181818183
6877507,4,B00QR1JZ3O,This shows its always a chance for growth if YOU take hold of it !,1481155200,,66,3.466666666666667
6877508,1,B00QR1JZ3O,"I stopped watching this movie when the girl tricks the foster parents out of their house and burns it down.  Now I don't know what horrible things they might have done to deserve this revenge, but I did not want to find out.  The clever little girl could have found some other way to incriminate them and get herself out of that environment if it was so oppressive.  The guy was kind of a jerk as well.  I am sure eventually they both grew with each other's influence, but I did not want to put myself through the agony of the process.",1480636800,,535,4.215686274509804
6877509,5,B00QR1JZ3O,"A child and adult. Two lives unconnected, yet eventually intersect as they both seek to become the best version of themselves. How do they do it? Well, I will give you a hint. They teach each other the lessons they learned in life both good and bad thus enabling them to see that their tough circumstances could be overcome with effort in time. This is a film packed with life lessons that will leave you thinking about how you lead your life.",1478476800,,443,4.414634146341464
6877510,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"Hard to evaluate one's emotions about this movie. At various times or for long stretches, either or both of the two protagonists (a 9-year old girl and the 30something pudgy male she seeks assistance from) are not particularly likeable. I can't say that, after many adventures between them, I ended up totally liking them. Nonetheless, this film has an interesting even if highly implausible plot, and good actors. 3 1 /2 stars",1477180800,,427,4.944444444444445
6877511,3,B00QR1JZ3O,"I deducted 2 stars because it is not a comedy, you folks should not have advertised it as such.",1476662400,,95,4.052631578947368
6877512,3,B00QR1JZ3O,It was entertaining - nothing great but I didn't shut it off either,1475798400,,67,4.230769230769231
6877513,2,B00QR1JZ3O,"Two stories are told simultaneously, the director and screenwriter tried hard to make sense of the two stories and relate them without success. Nothing relevant happen.",1475539200,2,168,5.5
6877514,2,B00QR1JZ3O,Fairly predictable and boring,1474502400,,29,6.5
6877515,4,B00QR1JZ3O,Well developed and real characters and outstanding interactions make for a fun story with just enough suspense.  Due to some complex situations in this movie this is not a movie for children without parents present.,1473638400,,215,5.142857142857143
6877516,5,B00QR1JZ3O,Very good feel good movie. Very good acting from non-mainstream actors. Worth the watch.,1473552000,,88,5.357142857142857
6877517,5,B00QR1JZ3O,Great character study that kept my interest for the entire film.,1473379200,,64,4.909090909090909
6877518,2,B00QR1JZ3O,"The acting was good, but the storyline was implausible.  A young girl sets fire to her adoptive parents' house, then goes on a road trip looking for the brother (druggie) who put her in foster care.  She ""kidnaps"" an adult to take her on the road trip, and when they come back, the adoptive parents ""understand why she lit their house on fire; she was just looking for her family.""  That's just ridiculous.",1473292800,2,406,4.534246575342466
6877519,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"This is a quirky, fun little film. While it misses in plot a bit, the characters are interesting and relatable. The little girl reminds me of a young Tatum O'Neil, or Jodi Foster.",1466899200,,179,4.454545454545454
6877520,5,B00QR1JZ3O,Great film and I hope this Director goes far,1466812800,,44,4.0
6877521,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"Seems choppy and poorly directed at first, but later we realized it may have been by design to framatize the chaos in the characters lives. It's like a roller coaster with no brakes until the end, which is totally the opposite of what you would expect.",1464998400,,252,4.5
6877522,4,B00QR1JZ3O,Short but good.,1462406400,,15,4.333333333333333

6877526,3,B00QR1JZ3O,"Very convincing acting by the two main characters in this unusual movie. They stick with you afterwards. Ending a little quick, but all in all, a refreshing rest from Hollywood-y plots.",1456617600,,185,5.0
6877527,3,B00QR1JZ3O,"Didn't finish. Although the acting is entertaining, it moves incredibly slow. Do not watch if you have ADHD like I do.",1454544000,,118,4.666666666666667
6877528,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"As usual they got it backwards. You have diabetes and loose your only supply, you get real sick and DO NOT need to eat. Eventually you die from Ketone Acidosis. Taking too much insulin causes low blood sugar and then you NEED to eat something sugary right away or you go into a diabetic coma. Any diabetic knows this. Obviously the script wasn't read by one. Otherwise I enjoyed the good job of acting in this movie and the plot was somewhat believable. Worth watching IMHO.",1454284800,,474,4.523255813953488

6877538,5,B00QR1JZ3O,I really enjoyed this film. What a great storyline! A very unique plot which I really appreciate these days. I loved the acting. London Boyd and  Megli Micek are a great team and have a great chemistry. Very cool cinematography and awesome soundtrack as well. Highly recommend it.,1441756800,,280,4.833333333333333
6877539,4,B00QR1JZ3O,story is a little weird and takes awhile to follow. But it's a good movie,1441584000,,73,3.933333333333333

6877541,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"A fun little film starring a young girl who has had to grow up too fast for childhood and a thirty-something ""kid"" still growing into responsible manhood.  Their meeting and subsequent misadventures take them way off the path before both are able to finally get on track in life.  My preteen granddaughter could watch and enjoy this film; good family entertainment.",1440806400,,365,4.967213114754099
6877542,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"Like most movies I watch, the impact comes to me after the movie is over and I look back and access what I have watched. I wanted to quit but I kept watching and I'm glad I did. This was a coming to age love story. Not in the way you think of a love story between a man and woman but this is between two very different people with nothing in common. Dave is a sweet immature man and Eve is a hardened immature child. Life up to this time offered for both,very little to inspire them. Both have no true life experiences. Both have very little to offer to themselves and others, but if it wasn't for their chance meeting they both could have kept ruining their lives. Eve would have grown up most likely becoming a criminal and Dave would have continued drinking and avoided growing up into a responsible adult. I would recommend watching this movie. It made me feel a range of different emotions. All in all, a movie worth watching!",1440547200,6,931,4.295454545454546
6877543,4,B00QR1JZ3O,A slow starter and a great story. The growth of each main character slowly builds and ends with surprises. What will a person do to avoid consequences and get further in trouble? What will a person do to ensure to create his/her own consequences for a better life. Be sure to watch through the credits.,1439856000,4,302,4.509090909090909
6877544,3,B00QR1JZ3O,"Better than expected..the performance of the main character forced to change where he would have liked to have stayed in the same old rut, was quite touching.",1439510400,,158,4.888888888888889
6877545,5,B00QR1JZ3O,"Liars, Fires and Bears is a feel good movie that you'll fall in love with. It has something for everyone. It's funny, and heartwarming, with a few nail bitting scenes that will have you on the edge of your seats. My husband and I loved it as much, (or more) than our kids and teen did. Throughout the road trip there are some pretty big bumps in the road, which put young Eve, and companion Dave, in need of each other's help. Realizing they are not invincible is a totally new concept for both. However, being victims of circumstance, they soon form a strong and enduring friendship. And when life changing choices arise, they find the other's needs greater than their own. Through the course of their journey,  two mixed up people from different generations bonded, and inadvertently helped each other to realize what they really want out of life.  We give Liars, Fires and Bears, FIVE STARS!!!. And rate it appropriate, and awesome, for everyone!!!",1439164800,7,951,4.72289156626506

6877550,5,B00QR1JZ3O,funny little movie with great performances,1428278400,,42,6.166666666666667
6877551,5,B00QR1JZ3O,"A total surprise for an indie, low budget movie.  I would say four out of five stars, but considering their low budget they did a truly amazing job and deserve a five.  Has everything, drama, good humor and good acting, at least the main characters.  And a story line that is interesting all the way through.",1427760000,3,308,4.464285714285714
6877552,5,B00QR1JZ3O,"A good time, plain and simple.",1427328000,,30,4.166666666666667
6877553,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"Plainly and simply put, an awesome film. Truly something that needs to be seen to fully appreciate. A unique one-of-a-kind fresh and original piece of cinema that is lovingly created through an interesting story, but most of all wonderful acting. Truly imaginative piece. Loved the relationship between the characters Eve and Dave. Golden in so many ways.

I love a good movie when it comes together with flawless characters and an interesting story. Very few movies today are truly original. Something I've noticed in today's movie world is the idea of creating a plot seems to have taken a trip and seems to not want to return. Thankfully there are companies like Brinkvision that understand and see the potential of truly independent cinema, and cinema that is often overlooked by the mainstream. Brinkvision is the company that so far has never let me down in the outlets to films that deserve to be seen, and deserves to be experienced, and Liars, Fires and Bears is no different. It is one of those films that need to be seen.

A wonderful directed film. Characters that are unique and perfect in so many ways. The story is something that really takes a hold of you, and you end up not wanting it to end. Your two main characters Eve and Dave are characters you will never forget. Both are thought out and each one is unique and gifted in the idea the viewer can understand them, experience them, and follow along with the plight that they are going through. Eve is brought to life by an amazing talented young actress. Megli Micek is fantastic as the main lead. She creates Eve and never lets the interest of the character die out. You cant help but feel many emotions for her. Megli makes you experience those emotions in a believable way. Your next brilliant character is Dave, played flawless by Lundon Boyd, who might I add also brought the story to life and co-wrote along with the director Jeremy Cole. Lundon is magical in the part of Dave. Both Lundon and Megli have perfect chemistry together. Their relationship is outstanding and something that goes down in cinema history as being one of those pairs that demand to be remember and talked about.

8692398,4,B00QR1JZ3O,"The storyline was a bit different than the usual fare so it held my attention.
I would not consider it a comedy, yet the main male character Dave does offer a comedic touch to his character by often being pathetic, as he stumbles through life being easily led astray by others to do things against his will.
The other main character, Eva, is well-acted as being a cold, beyond-her-years determined girl.
Those two characters remain with you after the movie has ended.
Yes, it could be considered a 'feel good' movie, but not the sugary sweet kind.",1489276800,,547,4.649484536082475
