937959,4,6304898266,Lisa Boyle is no doubt one of the sexiest women on the planet.  After seeing this i quickly became a subscriber to playboy lingerie.  Scenes are no doubt hot and storyline is pretty good for a b movie.  I still think Lisa is behind girls like Alley Baggett and her girlfriend Patricia Ford in terms of overall looks.  In terms of acting though she does a great job i'll be checking out her other movies no doubt.,1004918400,5,412,4.311688311688312
937960,1,6304898266,"Rubbish . The version sold here is not the unedited version .
It quite clearly is missing a serious amount of footage and if you are looking for the kind of scenes you may have scene on the net or elsewhere this is not the tape to get . Get the unrated version , or if like me you live in the UK you can just wait until it appears out of thin air because it hasn't been released .",1001030400,4,380,3.7625
937961,4,6304898266,"There are many artists in this world and each of them tries to express their artistic vision through their medium. Some with more success than others. In a perfect world, all that would matter would be the imagination and skill of the creator. But ours is not a perfect world, and often the world of finance enters the picture. Particularly in the world of film: unimpressive visions are sometimes given a hundred million dollars to make a Hollywood blockbuster, and brilliant innovations are sometimes produced off of a single Gold Card in hopes that the creator has enough cash left to actually fly to Cannes for the film festival.
David Keith Miller's ""I Like to Play Games"" is a brilliant film cursed by its production values. The film's production looks professional enough and in fact the cinematography is excellent for a film not produced by a major studio. But had the filming budget been raised to the level where the casting director could have afforded a Sharon Stone or a Michael Douglas, then this movie could have been the next Basic Instinct.
To be honest, that probably would have been a tragedy. The film's principal actors, Lisa Boyle, Ken Steadman and James DiZazzo do a phenomenal job (particularly Boyle and the lesser-known DiZazzo) in this psychosexual thriller. The film has launched Boyle's career (such that it is) though she has yet to achieve the excellence in performance that she does in this film. Her ability to portray Suzanne, a professional woman with an obsession for sex-based mind games, with such believability makes this movie so gripping that one can almost forget that it was directed by the same man who gave the world ""Night Calls: The Movie, Part 2"" (Moctezuma Lobato). Likewise, DiZazzo (who to the best of my knowledge has made no other films at all) does a superb job of portraying Nick, an ex-boyfriend who descends into an intense depression witnessing Suzanne's new relationship with his friend Michael (portrayed by Steadman).
Director Lobato does a wonderful job of keeping the film working on every level it's meant to. As a psycho-thriller, the film is intriguing and engaging. The play between the characters is handled superbly, and there is exactly the right amount of sex and nudity to make sex seem an important part of the characters mind games and possibly to be even somewhat titillating without becoming unrealistic or gratuitous.
This film is recommended to anyone who has an open mind toward late-night erotica. It is easily one of the finest productions to be found in that genre with many more redeeming qualities than most of its peers. In a better world, it could have been a film that people actually saw.",978307200,3,2677,4.898678414096916
937962,5,6304898266,"This movie was awesome.  I actually bought it thinking that it was another movie, but I am glad that I did buy it.  There is a very interesting story to this movie.",955497600,,164,4.09375
937963,4,6304898266,"This Video is pretty much a Video Centerfold of Lisa Boyle and her fantastic physique.  We get to see Lisa play all sorts of erotic games with a hapless and confused laywer who really takes and emotional ride.  However, you'll soon forget the story as you watch Lisa Burn the screen up.  If you're looking for fine Cinema, move on.  If you are looking for a fine  woman, sit down and watch this film as soon as you can",953337600,,418,4.2405063291139244
937964,5,6304898266,"This DVD is great if you enjoy Lisa Boyle's extremely nice body.  It is almost worth putting up with the unbelieveably useless ""plot"".  Lisa (Suzanne) is a hot little go-getter in the advertising business.  She  enjoys playing games (thus the name) with her potential mates, and will do  anything to help the ""firm"".  Go ahead and finish your beer, you  won't be needing any extra brain cells for this one.",948499200,,406,4.714285714285714
937965,4,6304898266,"This isn't the movie to get if looking for Shakespeare.  It is, however, an above-average softcore (late night Cinemax) type of movie.  Full nudity abounds...an excellent threesome with Lisa Boyle, Jennifer Burton and the  lead male (whoever knows their names, anyway?) is the highlight of the  film.  My only complaint is that the plot actually gets in the way of the  sex at times.  The plot isn't the reason that I watched and enjoyed this  movie, and I doubt that if you are reading this review, you're looking for  Shakespeare either. If you liked Play Time, Basic Instinct, Animal  Instincts or Teach Me Tonight, you'll like this one.",945043200,23,640,4.842592592592593
7879153,5,6304898266,Great trip back to the Eighties. Hot actors with a stupid plot but still entertaining.,1501545600,,86,4.8
7879154,1,6304898266,Product ordered was the unrated version: received the R rated version in an unrated cover with an enclosed index for the unrated version!  The chapters and the index did not match!!  This product was misrepresented; returned for full credit!,1440460800,,241,5.153846153846154
7879155,5,6304898266,"I had seen this movie awhile ago and had looked on the internet to find this one and to no avail at a reasonable price.  Amazon to my surprise had it and now I do.  I think this movie is a Lisa Boyle classic as well as one of her best, thanks Amazon.",1379289600,,250,3.69811320754717
7879156,4,6304898266,"This is the ultimate in sexual teasing.  Jennifer had a great plastic surgeon, as she is stacked. The sexual games are provocative and startling for a conservative like me. An interesting change of pace shocker.",1365379200,2,211,5.0285714285714285
7879157,5,6304898266,This dvd is definately unrated.  If you want to see Lisa Boyle nude get this dvd.  The plot is fine for this kind of movie as is the acting but the nude sceens are the main thing and there are many from Lisa and the other ladies.  There is even a couple full fronal of the leading man for the women viewers.,1357776000,3,307,3.9193548387096775
7879158,4,6304898266,"Among all the softcore flix out there this movie is one of the hottest. A guy(played by Ken Steadman)is looking for the right kind of woman that he can not only love but also have a kinky sexual relationship with. His current girlfriend is very sweet but he just can't get her to loosen up to him in a sexual way. A very hot professional woman enters the scene(played by Lisa Boyle)and she sees that this guy is looking for a good time so she has him take her out for a night on the town but it's more than he expected. It turns out that this hot little business woman loves to toy with men by playing sexual games that go further and further until the man can take no more. If the man decides that he no longer wants to play the games that this woman has set up then she calls the entire relationship off and never sees the man again. This movie is such a good erotic thriller not only because of the sex but because of the way the sex is built up. Lisa Boyle teases Ken Steadman by showing off her lovely nude body and letting him touch her but she does not let him go all the way at first. As the movie goes on Lisa and Ken have sex in many places including an alleyway,a bathtub and they even have a threesome with another woman,HOT!Everything about this film makes it erotic,the camera angles,the lighting,the sex and even the acting is better than you would expect from a softcore flick. The main reason to get this movie is to see the beautiful Lisa Boyle do what she does best,have lots of hot kinky sex! Any softcore movie fan should buy this film. On a final note make sure you get the UNRATED version of this movie because the R-rated version has all the sex taken out.",1187308800,,1680,4.204334365325077
7879159,5,6304898266,"I have seen this movie with my best friend and she and I agreed that the best scene in ""I Like To Play Games"" is the one where Ken runs down the street with only a bathrobe on! The scene would have been much better in my friend's opinion if Ken had ran down the street COMPLETELY naked with nothing on him!! She also liked the part where Ken was arrested by the cop and spent his afternoon in jail for indecent exposure!",1091145600,,420,4.072289156626506
