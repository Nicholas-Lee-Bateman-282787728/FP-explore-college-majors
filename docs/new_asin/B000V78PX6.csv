The quality of this DVD just isn't up to it's price tag...someone got hosed...either the deal they signed with baeblemusic...or me when I paid 16.99 + shipping for a 25 minute performance with audio and video that's just not that great.  I'd give the video a B-...because the editing is done decently, and for a dark venue it's grainy but not too bad.  The audio on the other hand is not very good...maybe a C-  Was this professionally mixed?  I've seen better quality for free online...and I only expect the same quality that the price tag implies.

Overall I give this DVD a Grade C...3 out of 5 stars.

All Dax fans that support him should buy it and tell others. It shows great footage of his live performance and talent. His endless touring is captured in what he is best known for.  He gets out there and puts his heart and soul in to his great works of art. I would buy more of his concert footage if it were out. Come on record companies get some more shows and video footage out there. The fans want more just ask them. It's time for Dax to shine his bright light for future fans just finding out about him.
His music career is long over due for more promotion. Read his lyrics and sound for a better understanding that he is here to stay. Don't let this talent fade away and be reborn when he's not around.",1199318400,3,775,4.166666666666667
