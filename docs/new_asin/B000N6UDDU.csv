2759486,4,B000N6UDDU,"I would have given this DVD a 5-star rating except for reasons mentioned below.

First, there seems to be 2 versions of this DVD and this being the first released.  Not sure of the differences but I can tell you that Legend Films have done an excellent job restoring these rare glimpses of Desi and Lucy.  The down side is that most are excerpt clips and not the entire show.  The longest, most complete, and the most perfect looking on this disc is a sales pitch film they made for Westinghouse appliances in 1960 to be a sponsor for a new TV series being produced.  And it also gives you a rare glimpse from a helicopter's point of view of the entire Desilu Studios.

For anyone who has seen some of these TV shows on various other public domain sets can attest that they look pretty rough.  Not here!  Some are actually jaw dropping considering their source and there are a couple non-colorized clips that were taken from kinescope which in itself is very ghostly and hazy so I am sure impossible to digitally add color properly.  But they have cleaned them up to as good as they can ever get.  Just wished there was more here.

A must for Desi - Lucy completist and enthusiasts.",1240012800,4,1182,4.425925925925926

Like the 'Whats My Line' and 'I've Got a secret' portions were edited quite a bit - they're nicer on 'lucy and desi: a home movie' - wish more would have been on the dvd - but I loved it! 4 stars because I thought more could have been on the dvd, but it's amazing none the less. Totally worth it. Much of the things I've never seen!",1236643200,11,495,3.910891089108911
2759488,5,B000N6UDDU,"First, my bona fides as a Lucy fan: I've named my four dogs Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred.

I Love Lucy is one of those iconic shows that essentially defined an era in television entertainment, and consequently American culture.  Even today, with the multitude of distractions available, kids are still growing up watching and laughing at poor Lucy's antics.  Shows like I Love Lucy engender a strong bond with their resulting fans.

Lucy's Really Lost Moments is a package for the hardcore Lucy fan, primarily because it focuses on extraneous material as opposed to the cut and dry episodic formula of most compilations.  Don't come expecting a sequence of familiar show episodes, this disc doesn't contain any.  What this disc does contain is a host of stuff you've never seen before, like Lucy and Desi's appearances on the Bob Hope Show, game shows, Westinghouse infomercials, all sorts of commercials and trailers and bloopers and the pilot episode from the show.  All of this lush material has been re-imagined in full color, thanks to Legend's high-tech process, which honestly makes it look as real as if it had originally been filmed with a first generation color camera (sans grain and other uncorrectable evils).

There  will even be a studio tour around Desilu Studios with Lucy in a helicopter and a never befrore seen I Love Lucy show starring Bob Hope! This is not just a lost scenes DVD because you get much more.. If you love ""I Love Lucy"" or are a true Lucy fan you will have to get this set!!! This is truly an amazing DVD and something that you have never seen before!! I own all of the I Love Lucy seasons on DVD but I was very impressed to be able to see something new. The whole DVD set is remastered in super clear picture quality and is definitely worth the low price.

If you have any hard to buy Lucy fan on your list or a Lucy fan who has everything, this set is a must have because chances are that they don't have this set because it is NEW!! Hard to find in stores!! This is definitely not a cheap copy but is a really thought out DVD, that took a lot of effort and time to produce and is remastered in GREAT quality. I also love that you have the option on this set to watch it in color or black and white, I had to watch it in color because I always kind of wondered what I Love Lucy would look like done in color and it is awesome! It is neat to see the beautiful colors of the furiniture, clothes, and Lucy's bright red hair in never before seen color but you do also have the choice to watch it in both color and black white.

The box reads:

The legendary Lucille Ball as you've never seen her before! Laugh along with Lucy and Desi in these extremely rare television appearances, beautifully restored and in color! Includes a rare appearance of the I Love Lucy cast on the Bob Hope Show and the lost Lucy pilot. A must-have collection of gems from the first lady of comedy!

2759552,1,B000N6UDDU,"This isn't really a unique 'Lucy' DVD but a collection of things she appeared in or was a part of not connected to her actual programs.  For example, Ball and the IRR casts appearance on the Hope show was as guest stars and in character.  To take advantage of costs, etc, it was filmed on the IRR by Desilu and, as someone commented, in color.  The bit takes up several minutes and features Hope as Ricky.  Funny, but not really worth any special note.

The same is true for the other 'bits' on this DVD.  None are production quality and appear to have been copied by amateurs.  None are up to the high IRR standards.  This DVD is just bits and pieces like that.  If your a real die-hard fan then your probably going to get this for your collection, but for casual fans of ILL or Ball there isn't much here.  I would wonder how someone could rate this a '5' star effort.  It's just not that good.  But, fans are fans and will get up for just about anything.

Ball and Arnaz did many commercials and guest spots on other shows during the 1950's.  Nearly all are in the public domain, which means they can usually be found on YouTube, etc.  All have that same quality as well.  Since this DVD is marketed with ILL graphics and use of the name 'Lucy' its easy to think its connected with the show.  A casual glance would lead some to believe it contained lost, color episodes and the likes.  I imagine many were sold based on that bit of marketing promotion.  Kind of misleading marketing and promotion.  I don't think the DVD would draw much interest had it promoted the actual content.

Lucy's image and likeness is owned by Desilu Too, LLC which in turn is owned by Desi Jr & Lucie Arnaz and was left to them in their parents wills.  The two control how her name (and related, non-video images, Desi Arnaz as well) is used and receive percentages of the profit from sales.  The last I heard the two had hired a well known marketing firm to handle this kind of thing.  The same firm who markets other dead celebs, like Elvis.  The two do not, however, own the word 'Lucy' (that is owned by the company who owns the actual Ball shows) so they had to use the plural, 'Lucy's'.  Again, the whole effort is a marketing reach, trying to get the most associated magic from the picture (image) of her without naming the show or showing anything from it (the picture, for example, isn't from ILL but from another PR campaign prior to 1957).  A hard fit but creative.

Lucy is such an iconic 'brand' name that I wonder why the DVD was marketed like this.  Ball has an enthusiastic, although shrinking fanbase, who like Elvis' will buy nearly anything connected to the star.  No matter how bad.  They know the product, etc, and could care less about packaging, etc.

Probably best to wait and see if something actually worthwhile comes out about Ball or ILL soon.",1359331200,6,2852,4.404214559386973

2759568,5,B000N6UDDU,"My fellow reviewer ""Tee"" has already outlined the bounty of treasures contained in this DVD, but I'm going to be adding my voice to the choir.  Between this DVD from Legend Films, and the extras-laden seasons sets of ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"" distributed by CBS and MPI respectively, we now have access to an entire treasure trove of Lucy memories and laughs that will last a lifetime!

For many of their programmes in the late Fifties, Desilu was sponsored by Westinghouse Electricals (a decidedly more 'family-friendly' option to their first big ""I Love Lucy"" sponsor, Phillip Morris Cigarettes), giving way to countless promotional spots, many featuring longtime Westinghouse spokeswoman Betty ""The Dramatic Sand Test"" Furness.  Several are included here, and they are a delight.  The Lucy skit from ""The Victor Borge Show"" (directed by Desi and co-starring Gale Gordon) was later recycled for the ""Lucy Flies to London"" episode of ""The Lucy Show"".  It's even funnier here, with a set which actually lurches and rolls like a real aeroplane in turbulent flight!

The brief promo for ""Adventures of a Model"" is much appreciated from this corner.  This was a sitcom that was especially-tailored by the ""Lucy"" creators for actress Joanne Dru, but it never got past an initial pilot for the ""Colgate Theater"".  There's also a fun segment from ""I've Got a Secret"", where Lucy plays havoc with panel members Johnny Carson and Betsy Palmer; Ball is visibly tired (this was during the period when she was on Broadway in ""Wildcat"") but she soldiers on magnificently.

The colourized versions of the main features are nicely done, but a lot of Lucy's charm in the early days was the high quality of the black-and-white photography.  Happily we have the choice, so you can view these classic Lucy moments in whichever format you choose.  This will be an essential purchase for the Lucy fans.  Recommended.",1287100800,12,1919,5.0
2759569,5,B000N6UDDU,"This was a very enjoyable DVD.  It was refreshing to see Lucille and Desi in other elements.  Additionally, it was interesting to see how advertising was handled back then, as well as the marketing genius of Desi behind the scenes, and also the success of Desilu Productions.  I would recommend this DVD for diehard I love Lucy fans.",1281052800,,333,4.706896551724138
2759570,5,B000N6UDDU,"First of all, to paraphrase the old saying, don't judge this DVD by it's cover, which is rather generic and uninspired and looks like a dollar store public domain LUCY SHOW release.  What we have here is an awesome collection of vintage television appearances by Lucille Ball outside of her various series (although on occasion she is joined not only by Desi but Vivian Vance and William Frawley as well).  This is really a set for Lucy fanatics (who number in the millions) as opposed to the casual viewer who wants to watch a comedy show.

A further bonus is promo trailers for other colorized DVDs by this company of Shirley Temple, Laurel & Hardy, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, and Jackie Robinson that look fantastic.  Colorization has come along way from the garish early days of the 1980's and most of these look wonderful.

This is a DVD that every Lucy fanatic will love, for the small group of people who don't fall into that category may also enjoy it as well.",1280016000,49,2895,4.634577603143418

8175410,5,B000N6UDDU,"If you love the ""I Love Lucy"" program, then you will like these few special appearances that they made with the original cast on other people's programs.  In addition, they were promoting their own new show by introducing their studio, never before seen studio lot by helicopter.  It was nice seeing the couple in these old films with the added colors.  The couple were usually still in their original characters, but once in a while you can see them as real personalities.  Nice collection of their special appearances.",1509667200,,520,4.875

Why had I never noticed that both Lucy and Ethel are knockouts? (Ethel actually had a great figure back then.) I was really entertained by the exchanging of roles, and the ""infomercial"" was really a time-trip -- that pile-up of fabulous appliances was hilarious! Talk about outdated, I choked when Ricky told the rep from the sponsor that he was really trying to do a good job for ""you boys!"" In truth, younger folks might not ""get it,"" but I sure did, and highly recommend it. (And now I want pink appliances!)",1501027200,,681,4.3700787401574805
