8247837,3,B0012UEQ3Y,"I recently saw this movie for the first time and if you like really cheesy B movies, this is definitely one for you. An enjoyably cheesy B-movie that has bad acting all around (everyone seems to agree on that), but also some imaginatively gruesome scenes that make it worthwhile for undemanding genre fans. Inarguable highlight is the scene involving a naked girl (of course!), a bathtub and several snakes.....ugh! See if you can understand the point of the brief shot after the closing credits.

It's got it all...bad acting, horrible effects, random naked people. I found it particularly enjoyable because it's set in Houston, TX. So I got to look back and remember what this city looked like 15 years ago. All in all, this movie is a good way to spend a couple hours.",1386633600,,771,4.711111111111111

8247839,3,B0012UEQ3Y,"I recall this movie from when it came out.  One title was ""The Lamp,"" and the other was ""The Outing.""  So far, this has been the only version I have been able to find of this film.

If you have seen the ""Wishmaster"" series, you have a good idea of where this one is going.  However, while the film is much, much darker (at times you can barely see what is going on), I think it is superior in many ways.  If not superior, then at least original.

The real issue here is it's weak ending, which is also a minor plot issue.  Following closely is the very poor special effects for the creature, but then this is pre-digital days.

For the price, if you still have a VHS player around, it isn't bad.  Just don't expect to be amazed at the ending.",1299974400,,742,4.1328671328671325

8247843,1,B0012UEQ3Y,"I love watching b-movies. I get a huge kick out of a movie that is supposed to be scary and is hilarious! I got into movies like this from watching ""Dark Universe"" which may be one of the sweetest b-movies of all time. After successfully purchasing a couple other great pictures I stumbled upon ""The Outing"".
This is a horrible movie, even I cannot find any enjoyment in the film and I love everything!
The movie starts out with a bunch of kids driving to school. For some reason a random person starts ramming the back of the the main character's ride. (This is probroley the best scene of the whole movie) Once they get to school there is a racist kid making fun of a black guy and then a teacher hits him with a pool stick. Next the group of main characters decide for some reason that they want to spend the nigbht in a museum, which conveintly is owned by one of thier parents.
That night they head to the museum to ""party"", which is actully just them sitting around doing nothing and randomly splitting apart. Unfortunatly the guy that was ramming their car earlier is now in the museum for revenge! There is also a evil spirit that is killing people.
Eventually everyone besides the main character, of course, is killed by the spirit.
This movie sucks! It drags the whole time, nothing ever happens, and there is no entertainment factor whatsoever.
I know it sounds funny and like a good film, but it's not!",1202601600,,1414,4.463320463320463
