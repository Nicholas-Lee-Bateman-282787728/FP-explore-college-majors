78562,5,078882273X,"This is a Disney classic for children! I watch Winnie The Pooh when I was a child myself! My mom use to have this movie, but it was misplaced somewhere. So I decided to order it on VHS to replace the collection!
Thanks for this movie!

78563,5,078882273X,"I remember watching this on the day before my birthday as a kid and (as always) being enchanted and intrigued by the adventures of Pooh & Co. And yes, we got our mom to play ""Poohsticks"" with us EVERY time we walked over a bridge!
Very gentle, sweet and entertaining video for young kids!",1026000000,,288,4.351851851851852
78564,5,078882273X,"Tender, endearing story about friendship. The characters have silly, playful ways to make a birthday special. Even after 30 years it still can get pre-schoolers to stand up and sing along. Tigger is a delightful scamp like many pre-schoolers. Children loved it! They said they'd watch it a million times. ""I want to walk to the creek and play that stick game."" ""I'm going to have a cake for my party like Eeyore."" ""Tigger was sad when he pushed Eeyore into the water."" ""This was great.""

78565,5,078882273X,"The moment you push play and it begins in Christopher Robin's room, you know you are somewhere special.  I watched these Pooh classics as a child,(when they weren't classics), and I dreamed of having friends like Pooh and Tigger and Piglet.  To watch my son watch the same movie that I watched as a child with the same amazement and twinkle, makes our time together special.  A Day for Eeyore really shows the meaning of friendship and caring.  What a wonderful movie and what a wonderful feeling you get watching it, again or for the first time.",975974400,,546,4.597938144329897
