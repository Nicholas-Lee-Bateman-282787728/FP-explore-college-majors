8195279,4,6304161549,"This film stars Soleil Moon Frye(Punky Brewster/Sabrina,Teenage
witch) and Brian Krause(Charmed/The Liars Club/Sleepwalkers).
The films about Brians character who's girlfriend kills herself and you trying to figure out why? The story brings you to maybe a ghost of his girlfriend at his job/home. Is someoene trying to destroy him or is it his dead girlfriend? also,the film adds a crush that one of his students has of him, who is played in excellence by Soleil Moon Frye. This film actually deservs maybe two and a half to three stars,but the people in the film, especially Soleil make this film appealing.",1000684800,2,608,5.09
