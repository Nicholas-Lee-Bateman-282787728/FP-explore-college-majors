4466163,5,B004U0JMFU,This really helps me get started in the morning to center me and also helps to release stress in the evening.  A must buy,1413331200,7,121,4.041666666666667
4466164,5,B004U0JMFU,I would recommend this product.,1410480000,,31,5.4
4466165,5,B004U0JMFU,"I love this DVD, for the reasons stated by others - when you don't have 40 minutes to spare, you can most likely find 7 minutes or 14-16 to do these routines, and feel energized and grounded afterward.
I was planning to buy a copy for my sister.
I don't understand the Amazon pricing - the other DVD's are $14-16, and this one is $42???  On the exercisetoheal website it's $20.  I must have bought mine there.",1391904000,32,409,4.298701298701299
4466166,5,B004U0JMFU,I truly enjoyed it! A great way to relieve stress. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone. Hands down.,1386460800,10,111,4.6
4466167,5,B004U0JMFU,"This DVD is an excellent choice for anyone who has chronic discomfort in their body from too much sitting and not enough exercise, but who is pressed for time and not able to commit to a longer practice session.  There are two 7 minute routines: AM & PM, and two longer (14 & 16 minute) routines.  A great way to ease yourself into the profoundly beneficial practice of Qi Gong.
Lee Holden is my favorite Qi Gong instructor and I appreciate that this particular video gives me an option for days I don't have time for a longer practice.  I have a number of his video from the Exercise to Heal collection and rotate through them doing a different one each day.  This delightful Qi Gong practice is a recorded in the natural beauty of Lake Tahoe.  . Lee has a peaceful, gentle, presence, and his slow flowing movements bring a sense of calm as he leads you to gently increase your range of motion and improve muscle tone, while improving the flow of blood, chi and lymph.  This video series is extremely well produced and the movements well-paced with the rhythm of the breath. The natural setting that forms the background is truly spectacular...and adds immeasurably to the overall quality and benefits of this production.",1385337600,28,1222,4.6342592592592595
4466168,5,B004U0JMFU,I have several qi gong dvds but don't have 45 min/1 hr a day to devote to them and ended up never using them. This dvd is so great. There is a 7 min am and 7 min pm session and longer versions as well if you like. I like the teacher and this is a great way to stretch and get grounded before starting the day.,1382400000,23,309,3.626865671641791
4466169,5,B004U0JMFU,"Lee Holden does a great job with his Qi Gong DVDs, I haven't watched one I didn't like.  This is the best type of exercise I can do.",1323648000,5,132,3.7142857142857144
4466170,5,B004U0JMFU,"This DVD contains both an AM & PM routine. There are 2 AM routines and 2 PM routines. 2 seven minutes and 2 expanded routines. They hit all the major areas and because they are short a person will be more inclined to do them. I am not a morning person and this routine is easy to incorporate into ones schedule. I used the AM routine when I  travel and it helps start the morning before you shower. I also have the book by the same name and think it is one of Lee Holden's best programs. I have purchased several of his DVD's besides this one. I have Qi Gong for low back pain, Qi Gong for stress, QiGong for Weight Loss, and AM/PM QiGong. Try Lee Holden,  he's in Rodney Yee's class as an instructor.",1288656000,15,701,4.109489051094891
4466171,5,B004U0JMFU,"I was surprised when the DVD arrived only five days after I had ordered it.  It was here in time for me to take on a trip with me.

Very fast delivery and the product was new as promised.  Very good experience!",1275091200,3,210,3.9523809523809526
4466172,4,B004U0JMFU,Purchased this item based on high reviews and repeated suggestions from long-term highly respected health professional.  Broke ankle and recovery took unexpected turn.  I have not had the opportunity to open this item and put it to use therefore I cannot review this item beyond the high praise that led me to its purchase.,1466380800,,323,4.962962962962963
4466173,3,B004U0JMFU,"This DVD would have a higher rating if it allowed you to select more than one program.  Once you reach the end of your first choice, the DVD ends, you have to start all over watch all those annoying info screens again before you can choose another program",1458950400,8,255,4.3125
4466174,4,B004U0JMFU,nice simple easy to follow and brief but effective routines,1456876800,,59,5.0
4466175,3,B004U0JMFU,"I got this for the evening routine, looking for a relaxing routine to end the day. My rating could be four stars - perhaps even five - if there were a no and/or little instruction option on the DVD; i.e., some way to eliminate or mute his voice.

He. Talks. Constantly. I do not find that helpful, nor relaxing in the least.

His instructional style voice and tempo could be interchangeable for that of an economics professor explaining supply-side theories (he doesn't, at least on this DVD,  have that ""yoga"" or ""tai chi"" intonation or soothing pace...if you know what I mean and I think you do).",1452470400,5,598,4.570093457943925

8441131,5,B004U0JMFU,"My husband and I love this version! It is quick and yet effective; we prefer the extended portions, as the seven minute versions feel rushed.",1507680000,,141,4.68
8441132,3,B004U0JMFU,I agree with all of those having trouble negotiating the DVD. You have to fast forward at the end and then try to get to the routines menu each time. The routines are tough and there should be something about the level of proficiency expected for these. I definitely need some of the beginner stuff.,1504051200,,299,4.454545454545454

8441135,4,B004U0JMFU,"We really enjoy the instruction and scenery, very relaxing!
Great to be able to pick the short and then the extended versions for AM and PM to fit into one's busy schedule.
Giving it 4 out of 5 since we were hoping for more Qi Gong but there's some yoga mixed into the AM extended as well (which is still good).  Worth getting! :)",1487203200,2,330,4.15625
