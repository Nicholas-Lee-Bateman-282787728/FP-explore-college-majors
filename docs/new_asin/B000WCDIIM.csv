8222505,3,B000WCDIIM,I bought this a couple of years ago and I just haven't been able to get into it. I really want to and I will give it another chance very soon. But it's just boring. But how do you make a drum lesson exciting? I don't know.,1383868800,,222,3.74468085106383

8222507,3,B000WCDIIM,"I read a couple of reviews where this product was given 4 or 4.5 stars.
Hence, I bought it directly from Railroad media.

The Course is good, but less than I was expecting. The quality of the videos are from more than 4 years ago. I thought that the videos will the same quality that the ones they have on the free website ""Drum Lessons"", I was wrong. The videos in their website are very, very good...in the course just right.

By the way, some of the lesson are the same that you can find for free in the website and a better quality.

Look do not get me wrong...it is a good product, but I would not pay more than $80 for all the package.

Still, if you are a beginner..nothing to loose.

Just I was expecting better from J Falk.",1323734400,4,732,4.126760563380282
