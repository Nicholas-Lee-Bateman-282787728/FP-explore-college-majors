5010853,2,B006OS1B8W,"Bought today from Sams Club.  Must have got in early.  This is the worst season set I have seen from this company.  Have purchased the previous 4 seasons.  They say the episodes are taken from the original Universal master tapes.  I don't know what vault these were stored in but they might have to check their storage methods because these sure look dupey as well as worn out quality.  On disc 9, the Frank Carter Story, you will need 3D glasses because the entire episode is ghosting throughout the entire show.  Gave me a headache after a few minutes and had to turn off.  Terrible quality, I hope that Universal treats their other shows better than this.  The shows themselves are great just the poor picture and sound quality of the episodes.",1334880000,15,747,4.598484848484849
5010854,5,B006OS1B8W,"I bought this today (April 18) at Sam's Club for $39.99. Did they jump the gun or did they change the release date???

5010886,5,B006OS1B8W,Wagon Train is a good TV series. I like the earlier ones with Ward Bond better.,1478563200,,79,4.0

5010888,5,B006OS1B8W,I love wagon train I'm waiting on more series to come out to complete my set. My mom and I watch them every night when we go to bed. She has alhimers and it settles her at night to sleep. It was her favorite show years ago. We love it,1472256000,,234,3.7
5010889,5,B006OS1B8W,its the seamless change over to John Mcintyre as the lead boss. Wagon Train is an all around great show. I watch it all 8 seasons 2 times a year. Its back when westerns were made right.,1466640000,,185,4.027027027027027

5010892,4,B006OS1B8W,"Missed Ward Bond, but glad that Robert Horton and the others remained strong in their recurring rolls.  The addition of veteran character actor John McIntire to replace Ward Bond was an excellent choice.  The stories and relationships remain powerful.  Sorry this was Robert Horton's final season because he truly made the show what it was.  vmbertolino",1446681600,,353,5.25

5010907,3,B006OS1B8W,"The tin box that contains season 5, boasts that the episodes contained within are remastered. They are not. Had they been, we'd have gotten color on 5 season 5 episodes, as broadcast in living color on NBC. Instead, we are treated to faded, 16 mm projector-worn black and white copies of these 5 color shows. It makes no sense that Timeless can obtain the 32 color programs from season 7, but not these color episodes from two years earlier. Wagon Train certainly deserves better treatment and ought to be restored like Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and The Virginian are. I have been pleased with the stories and am glad Robert Horton stayed as long as he did after the passing of Ward Bond during the previous season. Perhaps someday there will be a complete series bluray, utilizing the original camera 35mm negatives from the Universal vault.",1425600000,3,835,4.805555555555555

5010915,2,B006OS1B8W,"we were disappointed this time around.. The booklet inside the tin was all warped, and we're concerned that the disc's may have a problem. We're on the first disc now, but we're not sure how it will all turn out.. We've all been pleased in the past, but not this time.. Thanks, Evy Johnson",1399161600,,289,4.37037037037037
5010916,5,B006OS1B8W,The Wagon Train met my expectations. This was a wonderful series from my childhood. I loved all the characters in each series and each story.,1392681600,,141,4.68
5010917,5,B006OS1B8W,I watched this show when I was younger and still like seeing the old westerns.  Enjoyed the stars too. Thanks for putting the old show on DVD,1383091200,,141,4.222222222222222
5010918,5,B006OS1B8W,"We are collecting all the seasons of Wagon Train and are not disappointed yet. This was a great show. It was sad to have ""Major Adams"" replaced during this season but we liked the way they transitioned to John McIntire - made it as painless as they could!",1381622400,,255,4.333333333333333
5010919,5,B006OS1B8W,"We very much enjoy watching DVDs as TVs have far, far too many commercials.  These commercials are much louder than the program itself. In addition, we just love Wagon Train and almost have the entire collection.",1378857600,,212,4.888888888888889
5010920,5,B006OS1B8W,Wagon Train is a wonderful series.  Great plot with many interesting characters.  True experiences.  I've given it as gifts to family.,1375747200,,134,5.285714285714286
5010921,5,B006OS1B8W,"Just loved Wagon Train when I was a youngster.  Also, Robert Horton (Alias Flint McCullough) was my favourite actor.  Many great actors appeared in different episodes of the show, which I feel made it an outstanding classic.",1373587200,,224,5.027027027027027
5010922,5,B006OS1B8W,Here again is good clean viewing.  My mother is 91 and I enjoy watching her as she watches these movies.  She has such compassion for each situation.,1369872000,,149,4.481481481481482
5010923,5,B006OS1B8W,"i just finished this 10 dvd set and it brings back memories when i was a child i highly recommend this series for the whole family if you like good family westerns,some of the episodes i never saw so it was great seeing them for the first time and well worth the money",1369612800,,268,4.0754716981132075
5010924,5,B006OS1B8W,With the loss of Ward Bond John McIntire was an excellent choice to be wagon master in this adult western series.,1366934400,2,113,4.428571428571429
5010925,5,B006OS1B8W,I have finished season five and am eagerly awaiting season 6 which will be released in a few more weeks.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole series but will wait for season 6 before watching the color season (7) and hope that season 8 will be not too long in coming so I have the complete season.  I am highly recommending this series as they were an icon in themselves in entertainment.  Nothing can compare today!,1361923200,,416,4.447368421052632
5010946,5,B006OS1B8W,the only thing I did not like about this season was Robert Horton's departure. Season 7 was excellent with Robert Fuller but Horton was missed.,1358640000,,143,4.76
5010947,4,B006OS1B8W,"Most reviewers probably will not agree with me, but here goes. There are some stunning DVD sets out there that have black & white TV episodes from the fifties and sixties in which the prints are pristine. The B&W film looks like it was filmed yesterday rather than over 60 years ago (e.g. Yancy Derringer, Adventures of Superman, 3 Stooges, Abbot & Costello TV show) to name a few. The 7 seasons of the B&W Wagon Train episodes are not that way. On a standard definition CRT TV set they look ""projector worn"". Film that has been run through a projector many times. The quality of each episode varies, even on the Encore Westerns channel (although the Westerns channel may be using Timeless Video as their source). Some episodes may look worse on HD TV because the increased resolution shows more of the imperfections of the film. The color 7th season is the exception, the picture is literrally perfect. Even in that DVD set which contains B&W episodes of other seasons, the B&W ones appear ""projector worn"". Perhaps that's the only source Timeless Video had. Sometimes multiple sources are used to provide every episode so that quality can vary quite a bit with each episode. I believe this set to be well worth the money and very enjoyable to watch, but for those looking for perfection similar to the color episodes may be disappointed.",1357084800,4,1339,4.726495726495727
5010948,5,B006OS1B8W,"I have no idea why television or cable can no longer produce any show worth watching.  This is a great series, slow moving but with characters you can identify with.  My kids don't watch it but maybe someday.  Nice packaging too.",1355443200,2,229,4.536585365853658
5010949,3,B006OS1B8W,I have the first four but now Ward is gone I find I am losing interest a little. Still some good stories if this was another show but I keep looking out for Bond to turn up. Weird really.,1352505600,5,187,3.8205128205128207
5010950,5,B006OS1B8W,"I have all the first 5 seasons & the color season 7. Season 6 doesn't appear to be available. All are good, but prefer the ones with Robert Horton & Ward Bond.  I've only had an issue with 1 episode which froze, went off & on, throwing a fit. It was from season 5, otherwise have found the quality of all to be very good. It is good to revisit television programing from my childhood, better than most of what is on today.",1349395200,6,422,4.0843373493975905
5010951,3,B006OS1B8W,"Where do I start, the tin outer box prevents it from being stored with other DVDs.  The inner box is pressed cardboard, two of the ""pages"" had separated. DVDs are easily scratched if not properly handled, causing skips and picture freezing.  This set stores each DVD in slots in the cardboard.  They can be scratched going in and sliding the out, not to mention the fingerprints you have to put on them in the attempt to remove them.  If you plan on watching them more than once I suggest you provide your own storage cases.

The series, however, is pretty good.  The picture quality is fine and so is the sound. If you like westerns from this period you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy",1348876800,5,684,4.512195121951219
5010952,5,B006OS1B8W,I've not had a chance to watch this DVD collection but I expect it will be of the same quality as the first four seasons.  My only complaint is that closed captioning is not available.  That was not in the product description but would have been a nice plus,1348876800,2,257,4.224489795918367
5010953,5,B006OS1B8W,it was great to watch all those old shows again am wandering if there is a season 6 and any more before the color season if ther is please let me know and i would love toorder them from you,1339200000,3,189,3.75
5010954,5,B006OS1B8W,"We both have been watching season five and are enjoying it the same as we have the other seasons one to four and seven. We anticipate when season six will be avaialable. Wonderful entertainment. All stories have been good, except one had some rough spots, but we can live with it.",1338940800,5,280,4.509803921568627
5010955,5,B006OS1B8W,"After reading a few reviews about the quality of this Fifth Season of Wagon Train from other reviewers I was hesitant to buy. I do have the first four seasons and the season in color and have enjoyed each and have been satisfied with the quality. I have to say I find the quality on this Fifth Season to be equal to the previous sets. I'm not an expert on the production methods so others may have a far higher standard and the ability to spot deficiencies, but as an average viewer it's all good. I did have an issue with two discs that would not play two of the four episodes on them, but they did play on the PC. So, if you've been enjoying the series so far, order it!",1336867200,13,672,4.098484848484849
8502137,5,B006OS1B8W,Very good. Enjoying it very much.,1527120000,,33,4.666666666666667
8502138,5,B006OS1B8W,I LOVE this show. I WISH this season would become available again. I would buy it immediately. I have every other season but can't find season 5.,1524182400,,145,4.407407407407407
8502139,4,B006OS1B8W,"These 37 episodes were broadcast in 1961 and 1962. The quality isn't as good as some of the earlier seasons and a few of the episodes should be in color as originally aired, but alas are in black and white. You'll know which ones should be in color as the closing credits say the name of the color consultant, the same one for The Virginian.

Each episode is 49 or 50 minutes, except the finale which only runs 38 minutes. Robert Horton is not in that many shows and left before the season ended. Scott Miller stars in several episodes and appears in most.
