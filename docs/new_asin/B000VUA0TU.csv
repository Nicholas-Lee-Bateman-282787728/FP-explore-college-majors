8219989,4,B000VUA0TU,"I recently dug my deceased father's 1937 Gibson lap steel out of storage and decided to learn how to play a little on it.  There are quite a few options for educational material around and I tried a few of them, Georgeboards.com DVDs being one of the ones I looked at.

I have the Lap Steel 101 / C6th set, as well as the ""Getting Started with C6th - How to get that sound"" DVD.

The Lap Steel Guitar 101 DVD's cover the following topics:

Part 1: (DVD 1)

String Gauges - 6 String Tuning - 8 String Tuning
Picks - Bar Control - F Chord - Blocking & Muting - Action Zone - Vibrato - Count Up (finding major and minor chords positions) - Picking Exercise - A (key) Track - Scale Exercises - Part of a Scale - Blues Lick - Harmonic Chimes - 7th's - F (key) Track.

Part 2: (DVD 2)

Majors, Minors - Slide In - F (key) Track
1 4 5 Chord Slants - Diminished Slants - E Position A Scale - Bluesy Scale - Mix Chords Scales Blues Licks - 2 Note Split Technique - Steel Guitar Rag Parts (6) - Steel Guitar Rag (Entire Song).

An audio CD is also included with many background tracks in several keys.

Getting Started with C6th Lap Steel ""How to get that sound"":

1. Strings - Tuning - Count Up
2. Major Chords C D E F
3. Major Chords G A B C
4. Minor Chords Am Bm Cm Dm
5. Minor Chords Em F#m Gm
6. 2 Note Scales
7. Major 1 4 5 Progressions

As you can see, this disk is pretty direct and to the point, and a very good study in chords.

I also have another DVD from Mr. Boards, ""Picking Techniques for the Steel Guitar"".
This is a good study of picking / blocking / grip (multi string) techniques that is very useful knowledge.

As you can see, a lot of bases are covered, probably most of what is needed to get you off to a solid start.

However it is not a ""spoon fed"" type of course...you may have to dig a little and skip around a bit for the nuggets of knowledge, but they are there.

I think considering the cost of these, and the obvious talents and knowledge of Mr. Boards, they are a good buy, it's kind of like being able to sit down with an expert player and say ""show me how you do that stuff"".

You might, however, want some supplemental material, maybe a good beginners book like ""Mel Bay Basic C6th Nonpedal Lap Steel Method""  by DeWitt Scott, which would give the absolute beginner a little more step by step structure.  If you have musical experience with another stringed instrument, then Mr. Boards material would certainly be a very good fit.

One thing I was very impressed with was the speed of shipment on the dvd's I ordered. They were literally on their way within hours of my order being placed, and I received them within a couple of days.",1362700800,,2658,4.1063829787234045
8219990,2,B000VUA0TU,"Tho there is a lot of material, there is no organization to the lesson flow.

A LOT of the ""lessons"" are just him jamming with little to no explanation of what you are seeing on the screen.

Tho no where near as bad a rip off as the Lil Steel Volume 1 Songbook from steel guitar mojo, it is still not worth the $$.",1349827200,,314,3.890625
8219991,3,B000VUA0TU,"I am new to lap steel but not to playing guitar. I've purchased other guitar instructional dvds over the years from various other companies. The Georgeboards dvd is absolutely helpful especially for a beginner. BUT, I think it should include tab sheets to illustrate EXACTLY what he is doing on screen. It's great to watch and try to follow along, but when you get confused or lost it would be nice to refer to a printed tab and 'see' what the heck he's doing. That is my only complaint. I still would recommend this to anyone starting out on lap steel and I will probably purchase another of his dvds in the future.",1283731200,2,616,4.460176991150442
8219992,1,B000VUA0TU,"I don't know what the other two reviewers are talking about. I'm brand-spanking new to the lapsteel and I've gotten better information than this DVD provides off of YouTube and [...]. The instruction is slow, boring and unlikely to be worth a second watching (if that). The chapters of this disc are as follows:

1. String Guages
2. 6 String Tuning
3. 8 String Tuning
4. Picks
5. Bar Control
6. F-Chord
7. Blocking/Mute
8. Action Zone (How to hold the steel)
9. Vibrato
10. Count Up (Single String Scale)
11. Picking Exercises
12. A-Track
13. Scale Exercises
14. Part of a Scale
15. Blues Lick
16. Harmonic Chimes
17. 7ths
18. F-Track

8219994,5,B000VUA0TU,"I have always steered clear of C6 playing because, although I loved the sound, it always seemed too hard to learn. My son made me a custom lap steel for my birthday and so I purchased ""Lap Steel Guitar 101"" to ""give C6 a go"", I usually play a dobro with open G tuning. What a surprise! With the superb camera view and the easy visual and verbal instructions, I was playing along with the cool jazzy ""A and F"" tracks within minutes! I will now pursue my learning from further GeorgeBoards Lap Steel Products.",1222473600,4,507,4.347368421052631
