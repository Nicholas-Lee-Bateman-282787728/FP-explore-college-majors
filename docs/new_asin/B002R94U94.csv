8378482,5,B002R94U94,"My 18-month daughter loves this DVD and it helped her understand several concepts including lost, find it, how, again, where, what, etc.  She really enjoys the musical nature of Signing Time.  She enjoys her own Hopkins doll (we received when we went to a Signing Time activity) and we are constantly talking about ""Where is the frog?"" and other objects.  Another success for Rachel, Leah and Alex.",1362268800,,398,4.91044776119403
