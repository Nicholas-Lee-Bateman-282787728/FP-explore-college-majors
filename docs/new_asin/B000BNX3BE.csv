was ready to be entertained but this creature movie blew me

away with the great CGI, gore and action. The birds are predators and are hungry...and we get to see what we want to see and not just quick edits thats leaves the audience dizzy.

Descent acting, good monsters and a story....get your popcorn

ready monster fans as you won't fall asleep on this one.",1142208000,4,423,4.6
2430605,4,B000BNX3BE,"An American scientist and his students are in Turkey to look for fossils on a mountain.  They are warned by the government that there are dangerous men in the wilds but they decide to go ahead.  Enter an American military team looking for a renegade and you have the rest of the cast.  Unfortunately, a recent earthquake has unearthed some pterodactyl eggs that then hatched.  The are around the mountain is now the feeding ground for large numbers of these flying predators.

First one group and then the other runs afoul of the hungry beasts.  As their numbers dwindle, it becomes obvious that the only way any of them are getting away safely is to try and eliminate the beasts.  But is scientific knowledge and some minor military hardware enough to take on creatures that have survived the way these have?  Well, they have no choice but to try.

I really did not expect a lot of this movie so I was surprised.  We see the creatures almost from the start and we see a lot of them.  If you add up the screen time for each individual creature it would probably be five times the length of the movie.  The effects are pretty good although some of the injuries are rather campy.  The characters are somewhat standard for this type of film but a few twists are added to keep them from being stale.  All in all this one was pretty good.  Check it out.",1141430400,8,1348,4.4227642276422765
2430606,3,B000BNX3BE,"A neat little flying monster B movie. Considering it was made for TV, it's well made. Basic story is about a bunch of college students on a field trip becoming lunch for a bunch of pterodactyle's. The FX is very good considering the low budget. The actors did a passing job, although the self centered (im gods gift to men)big boobed blonde was a pain in the ass. It was good to see her chowed on by the flying reptiles. The film,has tons of gore(heads ripped of,bodies ripped in half and entrails flying in the breeze).Even a group of special forces tough guys are a feast for the ptero's. Hell I was rooting for the flying meat munchers. Almost as good as ""Q"",the David Carradine flying monster gem of the 90's.",1139961600,3,713,4.450381679389313
2430607,4,B000BNX3BE,"Sure, the writing, directing, and most of the acting is bad, but some of these people seem to have taken lessons before this movie and the CGI isn't to horrible either.

The plot is kinda neat. A volcano erupts, causing several dormant pterodactyl eggs to hatch. The things grow to full size in a couple of months, and next thing you know, there's 30-40 of these things flying around the area eating people left and right. They aren't very polite, either.

Overall, PTERODACTYL is a good choice for a weekend rental and the DVD has a nifty little making of feature. B-",1139097600,3,568,4.5588235294117645
2430608,4,B000BNX3BE,"Prophylactical Pterodactyl. This is the technical or Latin name. Pterodactyls are rubbery, do try to wrap themselves around men which stops them having babies, often terribly removing the head unintentionally.

  Truly, for one reason alone, this creatfeat deserves an award.

  Not since the original King Kong (maybe the new one too?) has the monster appeared so much! Probably more than all 3 JP movies combined. Compared to Crocodile (2000) for eg, 100 times more.

  Mostly the dino-soars look very good. And even the babies are CGI, or mostly. (But they don't have a low CGI index.)

  With more unflinching gore than inside your average dinosaur, also putting JP to shame, that's another reason it's hard to believe it's just made for TV if it was (especially as it was cut, I heard). The first reason being the cost of so much CGI.

  Just wish Cameron Daddy used his Australian accent, mate. There's more than enough Americans (and Eric Banana (seems only Mel has never faked a Yankee)). Coulda even been Pterodactyl Daddee then.

  See it with your bird. Or if you're a girl, with your dinosaur.",1138579200,,1105,4.849462365591398
2430609,4,B000BNX3BE,"This made for SCIFI Channel thriller is quite entertaining for movies of its ilk.  The special effects are pretty cool and the cast gamely engages in some ridiculous dialogue and action, but hey this is a giant dinosaur movie---who wants art?  Cameron Daddo plays a paleontologist who is taking some of his students on an expedition on the Turkish/Armenian border.  Amy Sloan plays Kate, his graduate student and would be lover.  Also in the area is a special ops force out to take custody of a rebel leader.  Of course as the movie progresses, the two parties of people converge to battle the army of pterodactyls, released by an earthquake in a volcano.  There's lots of blood and guts as the nasty birdies engage in their predatory feeding, and lots of tense who's gonna get it scenes?

2430625,4,B000BNX3BE,"A jerk professor (Cameron Daddo) reluctantly leads an ""extra credit"" expedition of nitwit students into the wilds of Turkey while American soldiers are stalking a terrorist leader in the same area.  All three groups run into the pterodactyls at roughly the same time, providing the dinosaurs with a much needed snack.
In this movie, everyone bitches and moans; no one appears to be having fun before or after the pterodactyls attack.  Needless to say, after the pterodactyls' first appearance, everyone runs and screams and shoots at anything that flies; some lose their head(s) in the bargain.  The jerk teacher eventually snaps out of his funk in time to launch a rescue mission of a student he's entirely too chummy with.  If you were to vote, he would definitely win `worst teacher' ever on the `worst field trip' imaginable.  (The survival tally in these types of movies is never negotiable; very few if any are expected to stay alive, never mind smile by the time it ends.)

There is a certain amount of fun in the idea of trying to survive ongoing pterodactyls attacks.  For the pterodactyls it was like having a catered affair; what a lovely buffet, I'll take two of everything.......on the wing..........to go.  I liked this movie immensely because it is uncompromisingly stupid on all fronts.  The dialog is incredibly hokey, the acting is marginal, the action predictable.  The only reason I really-really liked this movie was because the monsters are pterodactyls (they rarely get featured in dinosaur flicks).  If anything, pterodactyls are always relegated to the background, lucky if they just get to fly by in a scene.  Finally, they are the stars.........and some saps are shooting at them!  How fair is that!  Mistreated in their own movie.",1408406400,,1758,4.9965635738831615

2430637,3,B000BNX3BE,"...and the actors with Dominos.  So, yes, as the other critics point out, you have to know what you're asking for with a movie like this, and it's definitely cheesey...like, on the top of a crappy frozen pizza cheesey.  Coolio stars in it, and you know he's cool, cause it's in his name.  He plays the leader of a special forces group, and when I say special forces, I mean 'special' as in the Special Olympics, and not as in Seal Team 6.  They have a female member--nods to Hollywood for equal opportunities, but...there aren't any female special ops members at this time.  She doesn't have to wear camouflage like all the guys...I guess she is wearing concealer.  But really my problem with Pterodactyl was that each scene was pretty much the same as all the others: the survivors shoot at the Pterodayctls, mostly miss but kill a couple, and the Pterodactyls mostly miss, but kill a couple.  And do it again, and again, and again, and again, and I lost count.  It was pretty hokey fun at first, but honestly it got boring and my wife and daughter both fell asleep while watching it.  So I guess, watch the first hour and then turn it off, cause after all they paid the scriptwriters in frozen pizza and everything turns out exactly the way you think it will five minutes in to the movie.",1338249600,,1290,4.478632478632479
2430638,4,B000BNX3BE,"A  couple of years ago we caught the movie 'Pterydactyl' on tv. We laughed all the way through because the characters were so exaggerated. My husband had been a university professor so the protagonists were so 'close to home' for him: the female graduate assistant, the snotty rich sorority girl (whose father sponsored the trip), the overly smart 'nerd'. You get the picture. I'd been wanting to purchase the dvd since then. Just before his birthday I purchased a Beanie Buddy Pterydactyl at a yard sale and then got the movie through Amazon.

Fun movie!",1281225600,,211,4.410256410256411
2430643,2,B000BNX3BE,"Let's get a few things straight.  This movie has Coolio as its starring actor.  The main protagonist (not played by Coolio) is named ""Professor Lovecraft."" And there are pterodactyls.

Pterodactyl is two movies put together. One movie involves aforementioned Professor Lovecraft and his students.  You see Lovecraft is not the posthumously recognized writer of horror legend; he is a paleontologist looking for dinosaur bones of a...well come on, you must have guessed what he's after. There's no mystery as to whether or not these pterodactyls actually exist -- the titular beasts attack hunters in a field, tearing them in half. In this regard it's like every bad horror movie ever made, complete with the geek, the slut, etc. It's I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Jurassic Park.

The movie then shifts perspective to soldiers tracking down some bad guys in a forest.  Pterodactyl aspires to be like Predator; the soundtrack is reminiscent of that film, the soldiers tell stupid jokes, and Coolio leads a crack team of badasses who we know are there to die heroically but futilely in the face of terrible beasts. The pterodactyls even ""see"" like the Predator did, with a ""pterodactyl cam"" complete with red tinged vision.  Pterodactyl wants to be an action hero movie when it grows up.

Back to the hapless students.  Kate (Amy Sloan, a Canadian pretending she has an American accent) is a graduate student in love with aforementioned Michael Lovecraft (Cameron Daddo, an Australian pretending he has an American accent). After the misanthropic geek Willis (Steve Braun) makes a pit stop, he discovers the spoor of pterodactyls.  The hottie blonde bimbo (Mircea Monroe) actually looks at herself in the mirror and mouths ""I love you."" Then, for reasons that can only be explained by movie logic, she strips off her clothes and dives into a nearby lake.  And we all know what happens when the hot chick goes skinny dipping...

The best acting comes from the Sloan, who shifts from mimicking funny accents to a serious pass at her professor (making the term ""Lovecraft"" take on a whole new meaning).  Sloan's scenes with Daddo are actually good, but Daddo struggles to keep up. Once that romantic tension is ratcheted up the movie actually gets interesting. For a few minutes anyway.

There are some decent action scenes, interspersed with too-bright-red gore and inconsistent physics.  The best conflict is when Coolio, wearing a target-tracking helmet, runs out into the open, guns blazing, to provide target locks for a heat-seeking pterodactyl rocket launcher. Why would these troops carry such a weapon? Just in case they encounter pterodactyls, of course.

Pterodactyl actually does its research, although it got the date wrong for a supposedly buried pterodactyl coming to life in 1895 (it was 1856).  But then, there's quite a bit of history around the claim - including the fact that it's a known hoax: [...]

And that sums up Pterodactyl too.  It hits all the right notes. The monsters attack from nowhere, grab people, and haul them off to a fate worse than death just like in Aliens. They can behead people with the flick of a claw, like in Predator. And an idiot scientist natters on about keeping the discovery to himself and how ""they're just animals"" until at least half of his wayward students become pterodactyl chow, like Jurassic Park. But it just doesn't all jell.  The movie feels like vignettes from someone who's seen too many action horror movies.

But it does conclude with a sheep used as a grappling hook, so it gets an additional star for that alone.",1278806400,3,3584,4.94

2430645,3,B000BNX3BE,"""Pterodactyl"" is a hilariously bird-brained movie from the Czech Republic starring Cameron Daddo as Professor Michael Lovecraft, and Coolio as Captain Bergen, the commander of a crack special forces unit. The film opens with Daddo and some students going to Mount Ararat in Turkey to look for archaeological specimens unearthed by a recent volcanic eruption. In a parallel plot (that feels like a parallel universe), Coolio is leading his crack Army team on the Turkish-Armenian border in a convoluted backstory about ridding the region of terrorist thugs. Before you go any further, here is a key question to reflect on: is it a bad sign that Coolio demonstrates more acting talent than the remainder of the cast combined?

The Pterodactyls make their opening move against the science expedition's Jeep, taking a couple of students along the way, and leading to an otherworldly four-way brawl that boils down (roughly) to the scientists versus the terrorists versus the Army versus the pterodactyls. Daddo is thrilled by the scientific find, and the whole anthropology expedition breathes a sigh of relief after having been rescued by the pterodactyls (sort of.) The scientist and Army contingents join up, and from the small world department, it turns out that Coolio knows Kate (Amy Sloan), Daddo's former student and would-be main squeeze's dad from the Army. Mercifully, the most beautiful but annoying character in the film, Angie (Mircea Monroe) dies from pterodactyl-inflicted wounds, vastly improving the watchability of the film, if too late.

Before long Kate gets captured by the pterodactyl and is taken to the nest where there are numerous hatching pterodactyls pecking at her, leading to possibly the only flying tethered sheep rescue scene in film history, and, unfortunately, some horrible romantic dialogue between Daddo and Sloan on the radio. Also in the nest, the lone surviving anarchist terrorist gets fed to the baby pterodactyls in the film's most poignant scene. Intermittently a soldier dies, and their melodramatic exits are hammy in the extreme, pointing to more of a directorial and script problem than basic thespian issues: all the soldiers die utterly ridiculous deaths with big monologues and the whole nine yards. This can really try your patience.

A brave ordnance expert saves the day, setting the scene for the big showdown of the alpha male pterodactyl versus Coolio, Daddo, and Sloan, which occurs in an expansive open field (which would not be my choice for a place to engage an aerial war lizard.) I will not reveal Coolio's plan to destroy the pterodactyl, but I will nominate it for most ridiculous plan in movie history involving surface-to-air missiles. Obviously love conquers all, with Daddo and Sloan officially becoming an item, while the film opportunistically sets up for a sequel. In the final shot there is a long shot zooming to a cave teeming with hundreds of pterodactyl eggs, implying the peril is obviously not over. In an amusing twist, though, the final shot of the film is of a Tyrannosaurus rex rampaging through the cave destroying the pterodactyl eggs, which makes me wonder if we should therefore see the T. rex as the real hero of the movie.

The film gets three stars for hilarity. The script is beyond dreadful, and regardless of the talent base of the actors, this couldn't possibly be a ""good"" movie. The plot of the film is likewise ridiculous, but that's pretty much guaranteed in a movie of this type, but the bizarre plotlines here don't intersect well at all (the whole Armenian terrorist angle went nowhere, save for feeding baby war lizards.) The cinematography is quite decent for a film of this budget, but the CGI pterodactyls were less than visually stunning to say the least. ""Pterodactyl"" is a completely outlandish monster movie, and is quite entertaining as a fun movie so bad it's good. I recommend it to fans of cheesy science fiction films everywhere.",1269561600,,3941,5.077160493827161
2430646,5,B000BNX3BE,"This is not a sleezy rip-off on Jurasic Park.
The pterodactyls are so well done, they look like Stephen Spielburg created them. As real looking as they can get.
Story revolves around a palentology class on a field trip that runs into their habitat, and all hell breaks loose. The birds stop and slow down enough to get a good close up look at them. They're not zipping all over the screen at mach 1 where you can't tell what you're looking at. At the beginning of the film, one student is acting a bit dumb in the role,and you'll think this is going to be a ""B"", or ""C"" film, but just hang with it,and the movie very quickly carries itself. If you liked Jurasic Park, and special effects, you should really like this one. Movie ends on a good note (so to say), and even the possibility of a sequel.

2430647,3,B000BNX3BE,"Sometimes the monster is kept hidden, only fully appearing near the end.  That is not the case here, where the pterodactyls strike quite early, and soon a group of them are more or less in continuous attack mode, for the remainder of the film.  With a poorly written script, and annoying characters, the creatures are the best reasons to watch this film.

A scientific group on a field investigation to a volcano somewhere in Turkey, encounters the deadly flying reptiles first.  Also in the vicinity are rebel forces, and a special forces unit of the US Army on a covert mission.  The pterodactyls take every opportunity to swoop down and strike, killing people, or snatching them up as food for their young.  The CGI flying dinosaurs don't look that real, but don't look that bad either.  There's plenty of gore, with bodies being sliced up, limbs dismembered, decapitations, and humans being torn apart and eaten alive.  You know what you are seeing is fake, but it is still kind of fun to watch.  The characters are so dumb, that it almost seems that they deserve what happens to them.  If you are being attacked in an open field, why not just take cover in the nearby forest?  The cast is continuously doing and saying moronic things, topped off by a very inept and unprofessional representation of the US military.

If flying reptiles visiting mayhem on a bunch of goofballs and incompetents sounds like fun to you, then this Showtime production is exactly what you want.  With a lame ending, the so-so special effects and the resulting carnage is about all the film has going for it.  The film features one of the earliest appearances of Mircea Monroe (Fast Girl).",1246320000,,1671,4.737024221453288

It is goods to see them making these as they are the same kind of fun to watch as the old radiated monsters from the 50s and 60s B&W movies. An acheologist leads a group of students to find some old remains but instead they find living Pterodactyls and a Special Ops team on a mission. The two groups realize if they don't team up they probably won't survive. This is a special treat for family groups or parties so you can play, ""Who gets eaten next?"".

But I will admit that the writers had fun with their character's names.  Almost all of their names were famous science fiction writers: Lovecraft, Serling, Heinlein, Yolen, Bradbury, Lem, Zelazny, Donaldson, Burroughs, Clarke, and Herbert.

2430652,3,B000BNX3BE,"When you pick up a movie to watch and on the back cover is a pterodactyl chasing a white SUV and on the front is a dinosaur eye and a reptile hatching from an egg, you kind of have to know what to expect here.  Yes, there are some cheesy special effects, but the pterodactyls are actually done pretty well.  Sure, there is some weak acting, but then there is some pretty sincere acting too.  There is plenty of gore, probably more than necessary but hey..I could forgive that.  The film delivers in what it tries to do.  Gore, thin plot, action and a romance.  Oh, and the possibility of a sequel...that's important.  Then there is Angie.  I kind of hoped Angie would survive the film just because I thought she might just be dumb enough to.  How could you not love Angie?  She was beautiful, obnoxious and completely in love with herself.  There is even a scene where she looks into a mirror and says: ""I love you.""  And then I wondered why she became pterodactyl food.  Well, duh.  I was tempted to give this one 4 stars just because it was exactly what I expected it to be when I picked it up.  The only reason it didn't get 4 is because I kept figuring out what was going to happen next a couple minutes before it happened.  It was almost like a time warp where I came up with ideas and the film replicated them...hmmm, this could be a film in itself.  A couple things:  What was Angie thinking when she takes her clothes off in the wilds of a foreign country to go for a swim in an unknown and unexplored pool of water.  Forget the pterodactyl circling overhead, what about snakes and leaches and a hundred other things that could be lurking.  Not to mention the male students who get to ogle her in her underwear.  What about the trained soldiers when killers from the sky came swooping down on them?  Nobody ever learned how to duck?  What were those two in the cabin thinking?  They should have just hung a sign on the door: Pterodactyl Diner Now Open for Lunch.  And of course, that rope crossing anchored by a sheep.  Talk about an idea right out of the mind of a screenwriter!  No one in real life would think of something like that and if they did think of it, no one in real life would actually suggest trying it.  Did that soldier really think about the possibilities when he went out there to use the rope crossing?  Finally, there was Coolio.  He might be worth an extra star by himself.  Without much to work with he gives a pretty decent performance.  Caneron Daddo, Amy Sloan and Mircea Monroe make this watchable. All in all, this is a pretty typical Sci-Fi channel movie, better than most, not as good as some, but overall pretty entertaining if you're not looking for a serious dramatic sci-fi movie.  Worth a viewing.",1178496000,9,2740,4.373015873015873
2430653,3,B000BNX3BE,"Nope, this is ""Pterodactyl,"" a film where a group of American college students under the guidance of Cameron Daddo and a US Special Ops force headed up by Coolio (yeah, Coolio) become unlikely teammates when they faceoff against ""terror from above.""  In all honesty, the flick isn't very bad.  The students are in Turkey looking for fossils.  The soldiers are out to nab some terrorists.  When a local volcano rattles loose a few old dinosaur eggs, they hatch and become very mean, very hungry pterodactyls.  The two groups come together and work as a team to eliminate the pterodactyls and try to get back to civilization before they all become bird food.

It's campy, silly, and very bland at times, but the film does move at a decent pace and never really lost my interest.  The CGI dinos and gore are fake-looking.  Some have said that the gore is excessive, but who hasn't watched a B-movie that went too far with the gore?  Daddo and Coolio really do an excellent job, but Coolio's musical escapades make it hard to believe him as a Special Ops captain.  The supporting cast, comprised of unknowns, was sufficient.  Only Amy Sloan was mildly recognizable.  The terrorist group was their primarily for the body count but one of them does have a key role late in the film.

Overall, if you're looking for ""Jurassic Park,"" you've taken a wrong turn.  If you enjoy B-flicks like ""Frankenfish"" or any of the other cheese-tastic SciFi channel films, this movie will be right up your alley.",1174694400,3,1489,4.72093023255814
2430654,5,B000BNX3BE,"I brought this DVD from Amazon.us last year. I have just got round to watching it while on a break from work.

Well I really enjoyed the film, the effects were a bit naff at times but all in all they were good and real life most of the time. There is a bit of blood and guts shown when the Pterodactyls attack, but otherwise the film has a good storyline to it.

The storyline is based on Professor Lovecraft (Cameron Daddo) taking a team of students on an expedition to a dormant volcano where they come across Pterodactyl eggs which have hatched. In other areas of the dormant volcano there are a team of military special ops headed by Captain Bergen (Coolio) hunting down a dangerous terrorist. So not to spoil the storyline it ends up with them all getting together to fight and destroy the Pterodactyls or do they!!!! This is a must buy if you are a fan of movies like Jurassic Park, Godzilla and King Kong.",1168732800,5,912,4.358823529411764

But, i didn't understand the plot at all, i mean a bunch of pterydactyl eggs roll in 2 a volcanoe (i think)and suddenly you've got flying pteradactels every were? i don't think so !!!!! now lets go back 2 the gore, do u think that with 1 swoop of the pteradactyl, that it could ether, decapitate or tear u in half spilling all ur insides? again, i don't think so. About 10 minutes in 2 the movie, a guy gets torn in half AND decapitated. when they shoot a pteradactyl it falls 2 the ground and dies, and within 5 minutes there r flies swarming around it? any way, despite all my crittisism, i recomend that u giv this movie a shot.",1168041600,,923,4.071428571428571
2430656,2,B000BNX3BE,"This movie started off with a promising atmosphere which hinted at fun and thrills to come, but is let horribly down by laughable special effects, paper-thin clich'd characters and some cringingly awful acting.  The students (blonde bimbo, geeky nerd and sincere young thing with a crush on the stereotypical workaholic prof) heading off in their jeep into the wilderness certainly had potential, but any attempts to build a creepy atmosphere of isolation is diluted and spoiled by the intrusion of the weak and pointless sub-plot about an army special forces unit battling against insurgents.  This military operation (think Arnie's team in Predator meets the marines in Aliens) gives Coolio the stage to strut his stuff. But, I'm sorry to say, convincing he ain't.  Obliged to join forces with the students, the remainder of the film is basically a series of action set-pieces in which the humans battle it out with the pterodactyls. The ensuing gore is laid on in a very OTT style reminiscent of the Evil Dead series (but nowhere near as stylish) and creates a few (unintended?) laughs.  The 18 rating is certainly undeserved too - there are far more effective and scary 15's out there.  Even as straight to DVD `B' movies go, this is pretty poor fare. The final scene hints at a sequel - they really shouldn't bother.",1166140800,2,1321,4.9058295964125564

2430658,4,B000BNX3BE,"This movie doesn't have much of a plot or at least a plot that you can figure out but it is very entertaining.  The whole movie is a series of scenes where the characters are running and screaming as they are being chased by groups of large pterodactyl birds.  The characters are picked off one at a time by the birds until the very end where there are only two characters left.  The two characters are scientists.  By the end of the movie, these two scientists manage to kill the male leader of the flock of pterodactyls but most of the female birds are still flying around somewhere.  The movie ends with an egg hatching which is supposed to mean that a new male leader is born.

The plot is simple, 3 college kids, their teacher and his ""friend"" go exploring in some forest in Turkey. Unfortunatley for them the forest is A) Camp ground for a bunch of terrorists B) US Special forces, led by some rapper, are raiding the area and C) Prehistoric dinosaurs are flying around murdering anyone they see. Thus most of the cast is murdered in comically stupid ways, by poorly animated dinosaurs. I don't want to give any spoilers but lets just say you will be rewinding several times saying ""OMG that did NOT just happen hahahahahahaha"".

I had to give this movie 1 star because its labeled a horror movie and it is 100% not scary. Relabel it a comedy and I will give it 5 stars.",1152403200,3,942,4.292134831460674
2430660,2,B000BNX3BE,"Somewhere in Turkey, there is a forest where you may be attacked by man-eating flying monsters living in the dormant volcano nearby. To this place come one American professor who needs to publish a paper, one graduate student as assistant (and love interest), and four nave undergraduates who just want to get their degree from college. Deep in this forest, moreover, a group of terrorists are hiding, and the US special force is sent to capture their leader in order to bring back him alive. (But do American college students need to fly all the way to Turkey to graduate? Travel financed by one of the rich student's daddy?)

Part of this impossible scenario sounds like that of `Predator,' but in this film it is the titular dinosaur `Pterodactyl' - no, in fact, pterodactyls, to be precise - that attack the hapless special unit. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger classic, however, the creatures in `Pterodactyl' only bore you to death because of their cheesy CGI and dull and uninspired action scenes that always begin when there is nothing to talk about in the story. The film is not scary, nor exciting even with occasional gore, and when the flying pterodactyls look like big bats that you might see on video games, what can you expect from the rest of the film's 90 minutes?

Coolio is the captain of the special unit, and his acting itself is not bad. But at the same time, I am afraid, not many people would find the idea of Coolio vs. predacious monsters intriguing, and the results are exactly what you expect from the ill-judged combination. The other actors are not great either, but with this bad story and dialogues, and most of all very unconvincing creatures, none one can be blamed.

The saddest thing is that the director is Mark L. Lester, who once did the underrated action film `Commando' back in 1985 with Schwarzenegger. That was a ridiculous story, but I really liked the way Schwarzenegger's hero talked and behaved (throwing a telephone booth!). It was silly, but it was fun. `Pterodactyl' is silly, and tries to be fun, which you know it is not.",1142294400,6,2070,4.7444444444444445

I support scriptwriters, actors and directors, and I'm loath to say anything bad about another person's creative efforts, but in this case the movie is almost unwatchable. The story is ridiculous - an earthquake opens a chasm within a volcano, and pterodactyl eggs laid 300 million years ago hatch. Meanwhile, a college professor who has the hots for his graduate assistant leads a group of students into a war zone and encounters a U.S. special forces squad bent on capturing an evil rebel leader. ""Pterodactyl"" is poorly plotted, poorly written, and for the most part poorly acted.
