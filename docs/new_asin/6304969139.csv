I would have to disagree.  This video tapes an interview between Mr. Hancock and an interviewer (you never see who he is).  Mr. Hancock explains briefly what each video and book he has written is about.  As such this video offers nothing of its own.  If you have bought Mr. Hancock's books or video, you will not gain any new knowledge from this video.
Mr. Hancock should give this video to anyone interested in his work, however it should be free.  This is a paid advertisment and you are the payee.
I returned my copy immediately.",994723200,19,705,4.5476190476190474
7879892,5,6304969139,"To really appreciate all of Mr. Hancock's materials, I recommend viewing the tape Monuments to Life, which is a lecture he gave at Leeds in 1996.  In this tape he presents a wide range of his views, and shows his great insights to the ancient clues that surround us here on earth.
One of Mr. Hancock's greatest assets is his contempt for the ""stories"" we have been told as facts through the years, and his replacement of far more plausible explanations.
I would have to rate Mr. Handcock as a guide in the wilderness, and his insights provide a path to a far more acceptable presentation of the ancient world than any other single speaker.
While I would assume they don't welcome him in Egypt, I welcome him with open arms, and mind, because he looks and reports what he finds, not what he feels will be accepted.
NOTE: The next time you see pyramids with steps, don't think of them as being used to go up, think of them as being used to go down, and see if the picture makes more sense...",987811200,4,989,4.375
