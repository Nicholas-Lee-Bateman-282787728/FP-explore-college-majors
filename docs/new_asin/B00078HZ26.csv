8046378,5,B00078HZ26,"It is true that this picture has no subtitles, and the only opportunities to understand any of the spoken language are those bits of German heard prior to the voice-over translations. There are very sparse bits of English for the Teheran and Yalta conferences. All this said, the film offers by far the best view of the main theater of WWII in Europe, where the truly great battles were fought and where the Third Reich was ground down to its ultimate defeat. Beginning with the Battle of Kursk, where it was determined that the Soviet Union alone could defeat Germany, until the bombing/storming of Berlin at the finale, the viewer has before him a vision of the greatest human drama/disaster in recorded history. The images are there, and language problems are secondary in importance. Watch it and be moved as was I.",1304985600,5,819,4.774647887323944
8046379,4,B00078HZ26,"Everything the reviewers have written is true; this is a truly epic WW2 film. But it does suffer from the lack of english subtitles which for a work of this magnitude and international popularity is puzzling. Unfortunately director Yuri Ozerov's later films on the battles for Moscow and Stalingrad, although equally epic in scale and enjoyable for that reason, are also far more tainted with more propaganda and ""fictionalization"".",1242000000,,432,5.27536231884058
8046380,4,B00078HZ26,"This DVD series, Osvobozheniye, is a rare classic among Soviet-era films.  It is a5 DVD box set that covered the Second World War on the Eastern from 1943 to 1945.  The series is in the format of a historical drama that covered everything from battles (like the Battle of Kursk), to famous dialogues between world leaders (like the Yalta conference).  Although this series can be classified as Soviet propaganda, it does accurately portray the events of the Second World War on the Eastern Front.  Here are some of the benefits and drawbacks of this series.
 Tbe best features about this box set are the battle scenes.  They are huge in scale.  One example is the Battle of Kursk where scores of tanks literally plow into each other with all sorts of pyrotechnics and other effects.  Another was the famous crossing of the Dnieper River where one can get a big, panoramic view of Soviet troops dashing across the river with bombs exploding everywhere.  Best of all were the tanks depicted in these battles.  The German Tiger tanks do look like real Tiger tanks (and not like a US M48 tank with a German cross like the ones used in the film, Patton).  In addition, real T-34 tanks were used as well as those 76mm antitank guns.  The level of detail along with the huge size of the setting adds to the realism of the film.  As entertaining to watch these films for the battle sequences, there are a number of limitations.
 One limitation is the lack of English subtitles.  Unless one really wants to learn Russian, the lack of subtitles may be the biggest disadvantage towards reaching a wide audience.  Another limitation is a lack of English language documentation on the package.  If these two features were available, this series could become very popular among war movie buffs.  In addition, a special features DVD with some documentary video covering the making of the film could also enhance this product.
  Regardless of these limitations, Osvobozheniye is worth buying.  Again, the battle scenes alone would make a rare and excellent part of any war movie collection.",1231632000,9,2074,4.80225988700565
8046381,1,B00078HZ26,"GIVE ME A BREAK. RELEASE IT WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. THEN, IT COULD GET 4 OR 5 STARS.",1185408000,7,84,4.0
8046382,5,B00078HZ26,"This is a set of five DVD movies, each encompassing an episode of the original Liberation movie series (Soviet title: Osvobozhdeniye) and translated to mean: ""The Flaming Bulge"", ""The Breakthrough"", ""The Direction of the Main Blow"", ""The Battle For Berlin"", and ""The Last Storm"". They deal with the great Soviet Red Army drive toward the West, starting with the Battle of Kursk in 1943 and ending in Berlin in 1945.

These movies were also dubbed in English and released internationally in the early to late 1970s. Two episodes, ""The Battle for Berlin"" and ""The Last Storm"", were released as a single movie called ""The Battle for Berlin"", which I saw at the age of eight in 1973 in Bangalore, India.

Later, two of the earlier episodes dealing with the Battle of Kursk, ""The Flaming Bulge"" and ""The Breakthrough"", were also released in English as a single movie called ""Liberation"", which I also got to see in 1978.

A further number of movies were made by the same director, Yuri Ozerov (a WWII Red Army Major himself), through the late 1980s dealing with the battles for Moscow and Stalingrad, among others.

When these movies were released by RussionDVD through Amazon in the States, I was overjoyed. So I wasted no time placing an order for the set. Why was I so enthusiastic about these movies? First, I am a big WWII buff and have been so ever since I saw my first WWII movie: ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" in 1973 at the tender age of eight. This was followed by ""Battle for Berlin"", ""The Bridge at Remagen"", ""Tobruk"", ""Beach Red"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Patton"", which I saw by the age of ten. (At that time, we in India were lucky in that we got to see movies from both sides of the iron curtain).

All those grand movies were exciting in their own merit, but what is special about the Russian ""Liberation"" series is the realism and scale which they portray. These movies are really 'docu-dramas' in that they contain both the factual historical events as well as fictional frontline characters. The war room discussions are shown in black-and-white with exceptional attention to detail. The actors appear stunningly close to the real characters especially those playing Stalin, Zhukov, Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and Goebbels. They also did a very good job of English and American accents in the portayal of Churchill and Roosevelt (including Eleanor). Also, surprising too for those of us who lived on the other side of the iron curtain, is that although these movies were made in the cold war era they were surprisingly neutral in terms of the portrayal of the then western allies.

The battlefield scenes are shown in color. Once again there is exceptional attention to detail. This goes for Russian and German battlefield dress and kit (some of the Russian soldiers are actually shown fighting with ill-fitting, ragged uniforms). The tanks and equipment also look like the real thing. Aside from the ubiquitous Russian T-34, the German Tigers look like Tigers (not like M47 Pattons, which were used in ""Battle of the Bulge"").

Not only that, the battle action is shown in grand scale, with battlefields streaching for miles - complete with German and Russian troop formations. Aerial camera shots literally pan for miles. Battlefield action is so well orchestrated that some camera shots last several minutes (per take with no cuts!) and show minute details of both foreground and background action. There are literally thousands of extras involved in some of the action sequences. The action in the Battle of Kursk is nothing short of extraordinary. Red Army and German tanks are shown clashing head to head, with tank guns firing at point blank range and tanks ramming each other. Camera shots from the tank machine gun turret show steaming tracer bullets mowing down tank crew as they emerge out of knocked out tanks, with tracer bullets bouncing off the tank armor. Burning tanks are shown making a dash towards a stream in order to get the flames doused and tank crew with burning uniforms diving into the water - only then to begin hand to hand combat with enemy tank crew in the same situation.

The urban action in the ""Battle for Berlin"" episodes are also exceptionally realistic, with lifesize mockups of the Reichstag and other Berlin monuments.

Further surprising, is that these movies are devoid of anti-German propoganda. Germans are portrayed as human beings following orders. The only ones portrayed as being really evil are the Nazis, Hitler and his cohorts.

This is amazing, coming from the country that suffered the worst by the actions of the Nazis. That said, these movies are not devoid of flaws. For one, Russians are shown to be sympathetic towards German civilians (which we all know was not true). The Red Army is shown liberating a concentration camp consisting of German communist sympathisers rather than the extermination camps like Aushwitz. But, when taken in an overall perspective, these flaws are minor compared to the remarkable job done by the Soviet film industry.

Another point to note is that, although the movies are listed as standard format, they are actually non-anamorphic widescreen. If your DVD player or widescreen TV has scaling function, they will display in the correct format in your widescreen TV.

If you are a real WWII buff and want to see what the fighting on the ""other"" front was like, I highly recommend you jump at this opportunity of owning a motion picture masterpiece.

Final note, these movies are in Russian, with no English subtitles. Time to invite that Russian friend over!",1116288000,51,5559,4.901063829787234
