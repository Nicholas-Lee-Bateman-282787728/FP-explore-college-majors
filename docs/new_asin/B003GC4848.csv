8396462,5,B003GC4848,An excellent reminder of how much we forget where the freedoms we have came from.,1432944000,,81,4.466666666666667
8396463,3,B003GC4848,"I gave this only three stars because there is so much more the producers could have done with the scenes at tarawa. The iconic Sherman knocked out in the surf was only seen by accident during one 'panning' shot. The concrete command bunker was not shown at all. So much more could have been done to 'compare' conteporary scene locations and today.
I am not sorry I bought it but am dissapointed because it could have been so much more. Also, whilst not being a prude, some of the language was simply unneccesary even for someone of my maturity.",1360886400,,544,4.505050505050505
8396464,5,B003GC4848,This is an excellent documentary of what is arguably the most violent battle of the Pacific War. Ed Harris does a fine job narrating the story.,1358380800,,143,4.538461538461538
8396465,3,B003GC4848,"As a veteran Marine, I was looking forward to Leon Cooper's story about his efforts to implement a program to clean up the beaches of Tarawa, where so many Marines died.  I was not aware of the other story Leon stumbled upon - that many Marines still remain buried there, left behind when the war cemeteries were dug up and the remains of most of the dead returned to the U.S. after the war ended.

Leon Cooper pursues a noble cause and is a great character to see and hear. But it seemed like a better effort could have been made on the video itself.  Such a story deserves a higher quality presentation.",1311206400,,605,4.336283185840708
