8580242,1,B00CCF7PHC,This video series has extremely poor video quality. The quality is about as good as a VCR tape that has been transferred to a CD Rom then processed for an iPod or some other video capable player and then re-transferred back to a DVD. It's that crappy. Don't buy this piece of poorly manufactured waste.,1495152000,,302,4.509090909090909

8580244,3,B00CCF7PHC,"I'm a big fan of Rod Serling's original ""The Twilight Zone"" series as well as this 80s reboot that I grew up with (even with some of its obvious cheesiness). But I was rather disappointed in the video quality of this set. It looks like someone videotaped the episodes directly from TV back then and later put it on DVD. I know it was the 80s where on-location video recording (vs. film) was still new and unrefined, but I really don't think they used the master recordings to create this product set. NOTE: I am using a blu-ray player on an HD TV to play this. The blu-ray player should improve the DVD viewing quality, but maybe it's just distorting it/exaggerating the lower video resolution that was used to produce it.

This is a good collection of material otherwise. The only Twilight Zone series outside of the original worthy of the name in my opinion.",1390348800,13,860,4.548387096774194
