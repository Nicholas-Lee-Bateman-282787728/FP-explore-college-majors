8227095,5,B000X7SDKE,"And his wife caught him. Besides revisiting your favorite characters, there is a pretty good murder mystery going. There is an old dark house with secret passages and secret people. In the middle of this is Topper. And on top of Toper's lap there is a ghost.

Ann Carrington (Carole Landis) is returning to her old family estate. Traveling there with her friend Gail Richards (Joan Blondell), we see the front end of a rifle and soon the cab they are traveling in gets a flat tier at the most incontinent location. This sets the tone as later Gail gets ghostafied.

So who did it and why? Gail is determined to find out with the help of the only person who can see her Cosmo Topper (Roland Young).",1509148800,,697,4.4375
8227096,5,B000X7SDKE,"Not only is it incredibly funny, but we have a clever murder mystery too, and a mansion with secret passages one of which leads to a boat dock........so convenient to get rid of a dead body, which keeps disappearing.  What more could I ask for, Blondell and Young.  But there's many more fine character actors too.

This one will keep you laughing.",1250640000,,348,4.580645161290323
