8210228,4,B000TNZBYI,"The solution to this mystery really surprised me, so I have to give it an extra star.  This Italian-American (but mostly Italian) low-budget production, set in Florence, tries with some success to revive and expand the once-popular Italian giallo (""yellow"") genre of B-movies.  If this is new to you, imagine a typical Italian opera, remove the music, transfer it to film, and add atmosphere, suspense, and an element of horror that comes from either the supernatural or (as in this movie) the dark side of humanity.  This one has murder, rape, adultery, theft, political corruption, kidnapping, and then we get to the sick and twisted stuff.

The movie begins two years after the main character, Roberta, was raped by a gang of two; she is still traumatized, and her life is further warped by her despicable husband (well written and well acted) and her deceitful best friend (well written, the acting so-so).  Halfway through the movie, which keeps jumping to police tracking a serial killer, Roberta is kidnapped by a masked lunatic, and then things really get bad for her.

The central themes of psychological trauma (Roberta) and serious mental illness (her kidnapper) bring up my problem in writing this review--right now we're seeing a spate of movies with excellent and accurate treatments of specific mental illnesses, obviously because of input from experts in the field of psychiatry/clinical psychology.. In comparison, ""Darkness surrounds Roberta"" contains bits and pieces that seem right, for example Roberta's intrusive PTSD flashbacks (mostly of the rapists closing in), and the rest comes from the writers' florid imagination (and maybe popular traditions) about insanity, effects of rape on women, and so on.  So, compared with movies like ""The Aviator"" or ""A Beautiful Mind,"" this movie is really mediocre; but if I compare it with the old giallos, where abnormal behavior comes entirely from the writers' imagination, it actually shows some progress.

Here's how ""Darkness surrounds Roberta"" stacks up against other movies in its chosen giallo genre:
(1)  The acting is considerably better.
(2)  The cinematography gets the atmosphere just right.
(3)  The plot is more complicated, but I think the central idea is very clever.
(4)  Scene-to-scene transitions are much more chaotic, but it comes together toward the end.
(5)  Clumsy editing spoiled the suspense for me--things tend to just happen with no build-up.
(6)  Do these cops have any resemblance at all to real Italian law enforcement?  Much less authentic than other giallos.

So three stars for a solid effort within this genre, plus one for surprising me...and I did like it.",1433980800,,2656,5.1850117096018735
8210229,3,B000TNZBYI,"As a longtime fan of Italian genre cinema (starting back in the early 60's and spanning through the 80's and even isolated instances to date), you'd think something like this would appeal to me.  Having sat through, and loved, generally derided films from Joe D'Amato's Filmirage company and the likes of the Bianchi brothers, Lenzi and Deodato; having plumbed the heights and depths of the Italian subgenre from cannibal to zombie to nunsploitation to WWII-sploitation to erotic to comedy to poliziotteschi and beyond; being a proud owner of just about everything released by every major Italian director (and several minor ones) and every release put out by No Shame, Severin and MYA (as well as Italian releases by Shriek Show/Media Blasters, Blue Underground, Anchor Bay, etc.), you would certainly think this would be another notch on the video shelf, right?  Well...wrong.

I'm not sure how to classify this one, first of all.  While using a mainly Italian cast and set in Italy, the director appears to be one of those ""backyard coppolas"" from the US.  While it's not quite ""shot on video"" quality, the whole production stinks of mid-90's ""made for TV"" productions such as Forever Knight.  And while I admit to liking the first 2 seasons of that rather bizarre Canadian export, it's not exactly the kind of thing I'm into or looking for when I buy a DVD.

One of the film's presumed selling points is that it's supposed to be a faithful homage to the 1970's giallo.  Well...sort of, but not really.  I've seen closer homage back when I was still subscribing to C(Sk)inemax.  Another is that Redemption/Salvation girl Eileen Daly (the vampiress who adorns the covers of their original releases and hosts those cheesy pseudo-""erotic"" introductory skits (remember all those Jean Rollin DVDs a few years back, and how the intros had nothing whatsoever to do with the film that followed?).  Well, let's put it this way: a cute Halowe'en costume apparently covers a multitude of sins.  Her rather small role as the madam of (if memory serves) ""English Muffins"" (or ""A bit of crumpet"" or some suchlike cheesy pun) wasn't exactly flattering, and didn't quite show Ms. Daly in her best light, to say the least.

The film itself?  Well, not bad...if you didn't mind Fatal Frames.  I actually think Al Festa might have done a similar job with the material as what is on display here.  If that doesn't say it all, have a peek at the extras, and see just how unlikeable the director and crew really seem to be...a very qualified recommendation to hardcore fans of Italian genre cinema.  All others steer clear.",1254096000,,2604,4.8684807256235825
