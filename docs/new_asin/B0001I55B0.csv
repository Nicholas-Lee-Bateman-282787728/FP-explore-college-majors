8013148,1,B0001I55B0,"Can you market and sell failed prophecies, about 15 years too late? It seems that you can. ""Prophecy: The next 1000 years"" was apparently released on DVD in 2004, but judging by its contents, it was produced already during the 1990's. Sure, whoever is behind this ""documentary"" managed to predict climate change, overpopulation, peak oil and massive environmental destruction, but that wasn't hard, was it?

The other predictions are laughable: World War III starts in 2004, with Iran, Libya and ""The Red Army"" (sic) invading Europe. The decisive battle will be fought at Megiddo in Israel - where else? Or perhaps the polar axis will tilt, leading to gigantic earthquakes, with New York City and LA submerged by the ocean? Or maybe we'll be hit by a rogue asteroid, destroying us all? The millennium bug makes a very brief guest appearance. The whole thing is (supposedly) based on the prophecies of the Egyptians, the Maya, John of Patmos, Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce. Did I forget somebody? Ah, Zarathustra!

Whoever made ""Prophecy"" seems to have stitched together two different documentaries - there are two narrators. The producers have a very strange worldview, claiming that the world was essentially at peace from the fall of Communism to the Kosovo War. Geezus, what about the *rest* of the Balkan Wars, all the wars in the former Soviet Union, the ever-present war in Afghanistan or the genocide in Rwanda?

But don't worry, ye faint of heart, there is still hope. The male narrator (who is oblivious to peak oil) believes that science and technology might still save us, perhaps with the aid of aliens (the luminous guys in UFOs). He also claims that another ""turning of the wheel of Dharma"" will take place in 2012. The Age of Aquarius might still dawn on us!

On *one* point, ""Prophecy"" comes eerily close to a real prediction. The Egyptian calendar is said to end in 2001. Nostradamus is said to have foretold the destruction of ""the towers surrounding the new city"". The documentary illustrates this with a nuclear explosion wiping out New York City. In 2001, Al-Qaeda attacked NYC and destroyed the World Trade Center...

But, of course, this proves nothing. The prophecies of Nostradamus have been reinterpreted post factum for centuries. In senior high school, I read ""predictions"" based on Nostradamus about France becoming an absolute monarchy during the late 1990's. Massive Muslim invasions of Europe would follow, until Sweden (!) saves the day and drives the wily Saracen back to where he belongs. Naturally, the whole thing was based on a Swedish interpreter of Nostradamus, who apparently also believed that *he* was mentioned in the oracular pronouncements of the Renaissance sage. To the best of my knowledge, nobody *really* predicted post-Cold War history based on Michel de Nostredame.

What surprises me the most is that this warmed-over, eclectic stew of failed prophecies  la Hal Lindsey, Paul Ehrlich, Steven Greer and Pseudo-Nostradamus can still be marketed in AD 2013, shortly after the spectacular failure of another doomsday scenario.

8013149,3,B0001I55B0,"If you want to spend some money to get a DVD so that you can become massively depressed, feeling like there is no hope for tomorrow and that we are all ""as doomed as doomed can be, I must say"" -- then Prophecy: The Next 100 Years is a sure-fire guaranteed mega hit for your collection that will drag you down to the depths of despair in 90 minutes or less! Now, that's efficient!

Is any of this true? Perhaps. Should you buy any of the prophecy determined by Nostradamus? Not if you take into account that his predictions seem to be tailored and stretched to fit any situation to make them appear to be on-target. And, if Nostradamus and other predictors of doom and gloom are absolutely correct, what are you doing to do about it?

Of course, we can pray -- turning our spirituality to positive things. But, we can do that without spending money on a DVD that possibly could leave you too depressed to be positive.

In essence, this is a very well done DVD on a very bad subject that ultimately might contribute nothing to you in the long run -- but will drag you down for an hour and a half and possibly months to come.

8013150,5,B0001I55B0,"Every human being bears a higher man within himself besides what we may call the work-a-day man. This higher man remains hidden until he is awakened. And each human being can himself alone awaken this higher being within himself."" --Rudolf Steiner

While the influences of the Aquarian age seem to be apparent in some situations, many say the age will not dawn until 2600 (contested by astrologers). While we wish for peace, it seems we are still swimming around in war and insurmountable natural disasters. Even I have felt this awakening from the Piscean Age where it seems we are moving from a place of following one faith blindly to a place where we discover our own individual spirituality based on the teachings of many faiths.

The entire DVD shows how the pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place in the past and then it delves into ideas about how in 2050, seventy percent of the world's Coral Reefs will have disappeared if we continue polluting the oceans. At times it seems this is more about war and destruction than a time of peace. Comments like ""disaster"" meaning bad star make this intellectually enjoyable in places. The doom and gloom mood throughout makes you want to reach for more than a few Tums. I took three.

It is ominous at best throughout the first half and then it seems to lighten. Is there hope? Can mankind thwart prophecy?

After a great misery for mankind an even greater approaches.
The great cycle of the centuries is renewed:
It will rain blood, milk, famine, war and disease.
In the sky will be seen a fire, dragging a tail of sparks.
~Nostradamus

Nostradamus is featured in this DVD and while his writing is interesting, I found his use of rose petals to make a vitamin C powder to be even more interesting.

Viewing ""Prophecy: Next 1000 Years"" will cause you to wonder why they focuses so much on the past. It seems they wanted to put ideas into context and yet somehow they don't give many new predictions. They seem to be focusing on the past in order to prove the earth will go through more conflict on the way to peace. The visual aspects are entertaining and they do show images of lovely asteroids hurtling through space and slamming into planets.

""The third angel sounded his trumpet,
and a great star, blazing like a torch,
fell from the sky on a third of the rivers
and on the springs of water
- the name of the star is Wormwood.""
Revelation 8:10-11

So what do we have to look forward to in the next 1000 years? Depending on your religious beliefs you will have a different perspective. However, most prophets seem to see more war before peace. What I really want to know is why I keep seeing umbrellas in every movie I watch lately.
