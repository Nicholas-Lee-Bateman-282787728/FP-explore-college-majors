Anyway, it shows London in the old days and the cockney characters that died out now are well portrayed.  Nice script with a bit of humor. Worth adding to any B&W collection.",1516492800,,313,4.288135593220339

8528845,5,B008L2FJ5K,This intoxicating account of the IRA at the turn of the twentieth century attempting to purloin gold bullion from the allegedly impregnable Bank of England to bankroll activities keeps you enthralled throughout.  Intricately plotted and detailed the film has you in its grip having you guess the ultimate outcome.  The art direction and costume design perfectly evokes the Victorian Age and add to the overall ambiance.  Terrific ensemble cast notably Peter O'Toole in his film debut as the Captain of the Royal Guard and Albert Sharpe as an elderly sewer scavenger who proves to be integral to the plot.  A genuine sleeper not to be missed.,1435449600,5,641,5.018867924528302
8528846,5,B008L2FJ5K,It was wonderful to see a very young Peter O' Toole in this very well done English film!!  It apparently got him into the running for Lawrence of Arabia!,1392595200,,153,4.275862068965517
