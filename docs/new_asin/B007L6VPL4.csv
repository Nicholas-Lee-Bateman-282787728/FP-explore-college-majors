5095335,3,B007L6VPL4,"In ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home,"" the title character (Jason Segal) is a 30-something single guy who lives in the basement of his mother's house.  Emotionally stalled since the death of his father several years earlier, Jeff spends his days smoking marijuana and watching the movie ""Signs,"" convinced that his destiny will depend on recognizing and paying attention to portents.

When Jeff receives a wrong-number phone call and the caller asks for Kevin, Jeff regards this as a sign.  On a bus, he spots a kid with ""Kevin"" imprinted on the back of his jersey and spends the rest of the day following him.  The kid gets off the bus and later Jeff hitches onto a truck with ""Kevin Candy"" written on its side.  Jeff is convinced these are subtle signs ... of something.

Jeff's older brother, Pat (Ed Helms), lives in a small apartment with wife Linda (Judy Greer), works in a paint supply store, and wants to have as little to do with Jeff as possible.  But Pat enlists the reluctant help of his brother to investigate when he sees Linda at a restaurant with a strange man and suspects she is having an affair.

The brothers' mom, Sharon (Susan Sarandon), an office worker frustrated by Jeff's inability to focus, calls him several times a day, and is at the far end of her patience.

Writers/directors Jay and Mark Duplass (""Cyrus,"" ""Baghead"") have crafted a character-driven story about relationships, a feat that is becoming increasingly rare in American films.  The movie has a non-rushed, leisurely pace as it introduces us to each of the three principal characters in turn.  We first see each of them alone, which allows them to reveal more of themselves than people ordinarily do when others are around.

We don`t quite know what to make of Jeff at first.  Is he merely a pothead and is the movie yet another stoner comedy, or is there more to him than what first appears?  Pat is more clearly defined, since his life seems normal, though he is more troubled than he is willing to acknowledge.  The Duplass brothers delve deeply into these two men to explore why they are what they are.

There are amusing moments, to be sure, though ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" is not what you'd call a rollicking slapstick romp.  The film will bring many smiles to your face, but its inherent humanity renders both Jeff and Pat genuine people just trying to make their way through life as best they can.  Though on the surface complete opposites, their time together at a point of crisis draws out similarities.  Surprisingly, Jeff offers some wisdom while Pat, the steady citizen, flounders.

The best aspect of the movie is its authenticity.  We see people in embarrassing moments, watch them awkwardly attempt to navigate them, and are struck by the believability of their actions.  Though the movie is clearly scripted, some scenes have a spontaneous, ad-lib feel, so that not every line is a set-up for a punchline.  Though this reduces the laughter quotient, it enhances character credibility.

Segal's Jeff -- called a sasquatch by brother Pat -- is a hulking man-boy with a laid-back innocence that's a product of too much weed and too little sense of purpose.  Segal infuses comic touches throughout the movie, yet keeps the character grounded, never overdoing his performance for the laugh.  His manner of speaking is calm, thoughtful, and lacks any trace of anger or indignation.  This contrasts markedly with Helms' Pat, a tightly-coiled spring initially blind to the fact that his marriage is deteriorating.

Rated R, ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" contains some strong language, drug use, and a bit of violence.  At a streamlined 83 minutes, the film takes an interesting, offbeat look at relationships, highlighting the trials and foibles of folks trying to find meaning and happiness in their lives.",1337212800,,3795,4.84031007751938
5095336,4,B007L6VPL4,"Seeing Jeff, Who Lives at Home is the cinematic equivalent of a long bath in a Tibetan river with a guide whose philosophical exaltations result in a state of levity even though we know in our hearts he is just another clueless Midwestern white dude. But hey, at least he's trying!  The film wavers, quivers, jumps. It relies on coincidence and divine intervention, astrologically positioning our hero--the eponymous Jeff--in his home at the story's beginning, and in crisis by its climax 80 minutes later. At the outset, he receives a cryptic phone call asking for someone named Kevin so he sets out to find this mystical being (he is very stoned, presumably, taking a massive bong rip just after he spends a lot of time recording a rambling though perfectly apt understanding of the film Signs). His brother, meanwhile, is down on his luck, failing to properly understand his girlfriend. Oh, and his mother has a secret admirer. So the plot thickens.
  This beautifully shot film relies very heavily on signs and wonders which, while not necessarily bad, do challenge the verisimilitude of the audience. It is the little things that bug. Why does Jeff end up outside the Hooters? Why does everyone end up where they end up near the conclusion? The film, though it portrays an ostensibly simple story, asks a lot from the audience. You must willingly adhere to its whimsical world logic, if you are to enjoy the skewed though heartfelt events as they unfold. Thankfully, the performances are stellar. Jason Segel and Ed Helms are perfect foils for one another and develop a brotherly repartee embedded with decades of strife and misunderstanding. The men could hardly be more opposite and this adds dramatic tension to their fights and frolicking throughout the Louisiana landscape. Elsewhere, Susan Sarandon is excellent-though extraneous--in the final's principle subplot which meanders and broods, ultimately feeling more akin to a 30 minute television show than an addition to such a film. Arguably, Sarandon's mother character's lamentations provide a further undercurrent to the disconnect which plagues Jeff and his brother, allowing the viewer to see where the roots of uncertainty sprouted. The subplot, as a whole, feels vacuous however, and lends very little of substance, though it is indeed wistful and, in many ways, quite watchable.
  In the end, while it twists through a multitude of familiar locales (restaurants, hotels, offices and the titular basement), and situations (an outsider playing basketball with black youths, a torrid love affair (or two) etc) the film is imbued with an undeniable current of magic. The same magic which drives Jeff will, if you let it, bubble into your heart and force a smile through layers of film-going cynicism. The final scene is actually tear-inducing and its specifics won't be spoiled. If heart and integrity translated to box office success--this film would outpace Avatar or The Hunger Games in its opening weekend alone. Isn't it pretty to think so.",1333497600,5,3011,5.111788617886178
5095337,3,B007L6VPL4,"Brothers Jay and Mark Duplass (""Cyrus"") wrote and directed this family dramedy about a house-bound, pot-smoking slacker, dispatched by his mother to buy some glue for a little home repair. Instead, he thinks the universe has told him ""Kevin"" because of a mis-dialed call, so he gets side tracked. In very short order, he connects with his abrasive and egotistical brother who seems to make large purchases he can't afford in order to validate his existence.

  * Jason Segel (""The Muppets"") is a pasty, pudgy, overgrown pot-head, who watches Mel Gibson's movie, ""Signs,"" over and over, reading more into it with each viewing. This sweet-natured harmless guy is seriously woo woo. Maybe too much dope?
  * Ed Helms (""Cedar Rapids"") is the obnoxious spend-thrift brother. We wonder, has his exasperated wife started an affair? We almost hope she has!
  * Judy Greer (""The Descendants"") is Helm's wife. Is she or isn't she having a fling?
  * Susan Sarandon (""Enchanted"") is Mom. She's been a single mother for a long time, so along with a case of terminal loneliness, now she's worried about BOTH of her sons!
  * Rae Dawn Chong (""Cyrus"") works with Mom and wants to cheer her up.

I went to this screening with no preconceived notions; upon exiting I told the publicist that this was a little tempest in a very little (R-rated) teapot. Expect LOTS of profanity, mild fisticuffs (Jeff is a pacifist), some drug use and a bit of vehicular mayhem. When Amazon.com notifies me of the release date, I'll make up my mind.

This one won't set the world on fire.",1333065600,,1553,4.771535580524344
5095338,4,B007L6VPL4,"Jay and Mark Duplass scored a nice, even unexpected, hit with their 2010 comedy ""Cyrus"", which I personally loved. Now comes this new comedy. I had seen a preview in the theatre a few times, and really was looking forward to this.

""Jeff, Who Lives At Home"" (83 min.) brings several parallel stories. As the title of the movie gives away, Jeff (played by Jason Segel) is a 30 yr. old good-at-nothing pothead who lives in the basement of his mom's house. The film opens as Jeff explains why ""Signs"" is his all-time favorite movie, and he is desparately looking for signs around him to get some direction in his life. Then there is Jeff's older brother Pat (played by Ed Helms), whose marriage is in serious trouble, the latest problem being that he bought a Porsche against the wishes of his wife (played by Judy Greer), who herself may actually be having an affair with a co-worker. Last but not least there is Mom (played delightfully by Susan Sarandon), who gets contacted at work by a co-worker claiming to be a secret admirer. Meanwhile Mom is concerned about Jeff and Pat in more ways than one.

The movie plays out in a single day, and all the parallel stories come together in the last 10-15 min. of the movie. I don't want to reveal any further plot points, you'll just have to see if for yourself. While the movie is of course billed as a comedy, there are some serious emotional undercurrents in this movie that are just as effective, if not longer lasting than a quick laugh here or there. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. That said, I could've enjoyed the movie even more, were it not for the borderline headache-inducing editing style of the movie. Indeed almost every scene contains non-stop moving of the camera, extreme close ups, and for good measure some more zooming in and out for seemingly no reason at all. It almost ruined the movie for me, to be honest. (And I don't remember this being the case in ""Cyrus"".)",1332633600,2,1933,4.535816618911174
5095339,2,B007L6VPL4,"Jay and Mark Duplass may hate the term ""mumblecore"", but their low budgeted indie films have become synonymous with intuitive, sharp comedies unafraid to explore relationships with real depth. Through a handful of films they've managed to avoid falling into the trap laid by Hollywood movies, which usually means cutting emotional corners to reach some sort of unearned happy ending. Not even a step into the mainstream with 2010's Cyrus, really Jonah Hill's finest performance of his young career, could steer them into the land of cliche.

No, it took Jeff, Who Lives At Home for the Duplass's to fall off their game. A heavy handed and mostly incoherent fable about destiny, the film is randomly funny thanks mostly to its charming cast. Jason Segel is Jeff, a lovable stoner going nowhere in life, 30 years old and living at home with his mom, Sharon.(Susan Sarandon) For a guy stuck in the present, Jeff is obsessed with the future, looking for clues to his destiny anywhere he can find them, drawing inspiration from M. Night Shyamalan's Signs. On the other end of the spectrum is his older brother, Pat(Ed Helms), an aggressive ball of nervous energy with a perpetual chip on his shoulder. When we first meet him in the midst of an early mid-life crisis, he's fighting a familiar verbal war with his wife(Judy Greer) over his irresponsible spending and chronic inattentiveness.

A mistaken phone call from a person looking for ""Kevin"", combined with his mother's desire to see him actually leave the house, sends Jeff on a citywide trek full of randomness and extreme coincidence. Jeff sees the controlling hand of fate in everything: a pick-up game of basketball, a delivery truck, whatever. The signs seem to be guiding him somewhere, and it's directly into his brother, leading the two on one epic day full of strange occurrences and twists of divine providence. Segel and Helms make for a pretty powerful comedic duo, but the lackadaisical plot does them no favors. Helms in particular thrives in an environment of rapid fire comedy, which this certainly isn't. It lounges somewhere in between, struggling to create avenues for Segel's gift of physical humor. He's just a naturally funny guy, and yet that is stunted a little bit here by all the mystical mumbo jumbo.

Where the film finds the most solid footing is in the exploration of Pat and Linda's marriage, and we see again why Judy Greer is one of the most underrated actresses working today. Why isn't she a bigger star? Their relationship is never given enough screen time, but in just a few minutes we can sense how lived in their home feels , and how they've both become too comfortable to even bother getting angry with one another. This is the Duplass sweet spot, navigating those uncomfortable emotional corners most films won't dare tread. We could be talking about this as one of the year's great movies if only their marriage had been the centerpiece, rather than just a small part of the broken puzzle.

Because Sarandon needed something more to do than just sit on the phone, a pointless storyline about a secret admirer in her office is tacked on. The only real good coming out of it is that we get to see Rae Dawn Chong in something relevant again. At least the conclusion has some energy to it,  a crescendo of chance, dramatic revelations and even a life or death moment. Too bad it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and feels like a desperate attempt to have everybody walk away happy and properly schooled. The Duplass's have traded away authenticity in favor of accessibility, a bad deal by any measure.",1332288000,7,3592,4.796445880452342
5095340,4,B007L6VPL4,"Jeff, Who Lives at Home isn't the type of comedy you'd expect from the likes of Jason Segel and Ed Helms. While the film's humor is similar to what you'd find in an episode of ""The Office"" (which Helms co-stars in) in the sense that everything is very dry and isn't necessarily side-splitting but chuckle worthy, both Segel and Helms manage to be slightly different from the roles they've played in the past.

Jason Segel is Jeff; a thirty year old pothead that still lives in his mom's basement. Helms is Pat; Jeff's slightly more responsible older brother with marital problems. These summaries don't sound all that different from Segel's role in Knocked Up or Helm's role in The Hangover, but there's more to their characters than what's first let on. Jeff is incredibly depressed and has this hopeless sense of coincidences being signs of a bigger purpose while Pat is a total prick. He does whatever he wants to do without listening to anyone else and has a way of making anyone he's talking to feel like an idiot in the span of a few lines of dialogue.

The other element is Susan Surandon who portrays the mother of Jeff and Pat. She's a hopeless romantic who hates what her children have grown into. Linda's secret admirer storyline is the first part of Jeff, Who Lives at Home that feels genuine. The conclusion of that secondary storyline is when the movie ditches its attempt at R-rated independent humor and becomes more emotional and real.

It's not that Jeff, Who Lives at Home doesn't have its humorous moments. The humor is at its peak when Segel and Helms share screen time. Pat digging in the trash outside of the restaurant as Jeff advises him not to and their conversation outside of the hotel room are two of the funniest scenes in the movie, but it feels like familiar ground. Any indie comedy you can think of is similar in comparison. It's like the movie is trying way too hard to be indie at times. I found myself thinking of Little Miss Sunshine. Once Pat's marriage heads south is when things start to really mean something.

The camera work was really odd though; constantly zooming in and out on still shots like Jeff sitting on the couch and talking on the phone or during conversations in general. There wasn't really a lot of movement to try and follow or anything. At first it seemed to be for a dramatic effect, but then the zooming became too frequent.

Films that have meaning should be held at higher value than the ones that are pure entertainment. Entertaining movies are fun, but it's like they only have one layer to them. Films that give a message seem to have several layers to them and if done properly allow you to feel more emotions and allows you to feel like you've witnessed the complete cycle of a group of characters. Jeff, Who Lives at Home treads similar ground that Salmon Fishing in the Yemen does in the way that the least likely person winds up being the voice of reason.

Fate and everything coming full circle are huge plot points in the film that are revealed in very satisfying ways. With some different from the norm performances from both Jason Segel and Ed Helms and a message that is both heartfelt and fulfilling, Jeff, Who Lives at Home is an emotional journey that eventually becomes charming after showing you its awkward stages of adolescence.",1332028800,13,3313,4.616298811544992

5095495,2,B007L6VPL4,"This movie is about fate. Fate, and how it can manifest itself in the lives of everyday people, at all different junctures. It delivers these points with the subtlety of a Porsche driving onto your lawn and into a tree. The movie hastily delivers it's ""heartwarming"" motif into your face through it's score. If you like ""touching"" music like this, you should check out the following: insurance commercials, rental car commercials, credit card commercials, and many more. I may not have disliked this movie if I had been warned that it was not humorous. In the Shakespearean sense, it is a comedy, as the characters are better from the experience at the end. But in the modern sense, this movie falls somewhere between comedy that makes no attempt at jokes, and drama that addresses points with levity. The end of the movie is wrapped up well, but getting there was not very interesting, nor (and I cannot stress enough) funny.

We start out watching as a day in the life of Jeff begins.  Jeff (Jason Segel) plays a gentle, harmless stoner who lives in his Mom's basement.  He often lights up, watches TV, and, on this particular day...Jeff leaves the house around noon.  He has to run some errands for his Mom, Susan Sarandon, and endure abuse and put-downs from his brother Ed Helms.  One becomes pretty convinced that Jeff is the glue that binds together a family that is a little bit less functional than others.  While his Mom is working her way through her day at an office job, Jeff gets caught in traffic.  He decides to get out of his car and see what caused the total traffic jam.  What he finds is that a car with an entire family in it, drove off the rails and into the water.  There are some survivors, but the EMT, Police, and Firetrucks are caught in shock, as are the surviving family members.  Jeff finds out from a survivor that there is another family member down there, still trapped inside their car, underwater.  So he ignores all the mayhem, removes his shoes, and dives into the water.  He rescues the young daughter of the family, freeing her from the car, and the emergency team on the scene does the rest.  By the end of this day, we are no longer certain that our protagonist Jeff is the freeloading loser, or pot-smoking slacker, or even the unemployed half-man half-child that is emotionally dependent on his Mom.  At the end of the day, Jeff's character reveals its self to be less easy to categorize or qualify.  This is an uplifting film about real, everyday heroism and just what that is and what it is not.",1510531200,2,1636,4.442953020134228

the plot

Jeff is an adult who lives with his mother, he doesnt have a job and he loves to smoke marijuana. One day, while his aging mother is at work supporting his lifestyle, she asks for one thing, to get glue to fix the kitchen shutter. In the morning he gets a wrong number call from an angry guy looking for someone named Kevin. Since Jeff is such a stoner, he takes this as a sign of how his day is supposed to go. Later while on the bus he sees a black kid with Kevin written on the back of his basketball jersey, so he follows him. This leads to more signs and more Kevins.

Meanwhile, Jeffs brother Pat breaks the news to his wife, Linda that he wants to buy a Porsche. She thinks its a bad idea because she would rather that they spend their money on a house and move out of their apartment. Well, too bad the Porsche is sitting in the driveway. Pat thinks that Linda is cheating on him so he follows her which leads him to meet up with Jeff on his separate journey.

Their mother Sharon is at work, and she starts receiving instant messages on her computer from a secret admirer. Sharon has been feeling old and unattractive, but when this admirer assures Sharon that she is still beautiful, she begins to feel confident again, and the two finally meetwhich leads Sharon and her admirer to where Pat and Jeff are on their journey.

the breakdown

Going into this film I had low expectations from the trailers Ive seen, thankfully the ads weren't very reflective on the films actual plot. I like Jason Segel, but after flops like I Love You, Man, I do not totally trust the actor. Ed Helms and Judy Greer usually play sidekicks in their films so there was no way to tell from them, although I do like Judy Greer, shes pretty and has a lot of sex appeal. It turns out that I really enjoyed this film; I was engaged as soon as Jasons character Jeff was set on his mission. Admittedly I cannot relate to his characters love of Mel Gibsons film Signs, but I can admittedly feel his laziness. The film was definitely far out there as far as his mission and the realness of it, but that was also the fun of it as well.

The first sign he had was a black youth wearing a personalized basketball jersey with the name Kevin on the back. He followed him and ended up playing basketball in the park with Kevins friends. After the game, Kevin invited Jeff to smoke a little weed in an abandoned apartment building, and while Kevin seemed to genuinely like Jeff, because he was such an easy mark and white, his basketball friends had to jump him and steal his money. It was like nothing personal, its just business. It bothered me that later, Jeff was taking a cab home, and doing other things that obviously needed money, a lack of continuity there. Susan Sarandon is a veteran of Hollywood, and therefore a big name attached to this somewhat low budget film as she has the chance to play a straight woman who instantly embraces a different side of romance, and thereby preaching her leftwing broken-brained agenda through her films. Her role in this movie seems to be added on as an afterthought and really doesnt have a place in the whole idea of the grand scheme of things that Jeff, Who Lives at Home promotes.

Yet if you can put aside those painful and uncomfortable moments with Sarandon, then this movie comes across as charming and engaging. The movie is rated R mostly for cursing and drug use, so it is not suitable for the kids. I give this 3 stars, its too bad because the potential was there to be a really great film.

5095823,5,B007L6VPL4,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to Jeff so much.  His relationship with his brother hit home so much with me, though I can't remember if Jeff was older or younger, and the typical trope is for the older brother to be the ""normal""/successful one and the younger is the ""mess"".  Wish more movies would flip the script on that, to show the pressures inherent to being the older (especially someone with struggles like developmental disorders, etc, yet you still have to live with the familial pressure to have it all together, be successful, be ""grown-up"", etc as the older).  Wish someone would make that movie.  Maybe I'll have to :)

A couple other tropes bugged me, too.  First, who came up with the whole ""living in his/her Mom's basement"" thing?  Is that actually a thing?  Always figured the person would just get to live in their old childhood room.  Too many creepy bugs in my Mom's basement if I had to move back...would rather she not take me back at all and let me starve on the streets, haha.  Also, it bugs (no pun intended) me how easy it is for characters to procure ""weed"" in movies since, while I've always been curious to try it, that hasn't been my experience at all and maybe I'm just really sheltered (not by choice I promise you), but I've never known any contacts for that sort of thing (despite going to college, going to parties, being out in the world when I had a ""real job"", etc).  So if ""losers"" (God I hate that term) like Jeff supposedly have no social skills like critics of movies like this like to point out, how the heck are they scoring weed? lol  Never understood that.

Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  Big fan of The Duplass Bros - the stuff they write, direct, and even just produce or act in is so full of heart and humanity.

It's just that the vast majority of people can't identify, or choose not to follow, the pure sense of individual purpose in each of us.  I love how the Duplass brothers convey the intricacies of life in their films, meaning the comedy in the tragic, and vice versa, the ambiguity of so much that makes up our lives.

5095899,3,B007L6VPL4,"Jason Segal's excellent performance as Jeff saved this from being a one star movie. In fact if it were not for him I cannot imagine even being able to finish watching it.
I was touched by his character, who has retreated to the basement of his childhood home, where he and his mother now live alone (she lives upstairs) following the death of the father/husband, and the oldest son/brother getting married and moving out.
Jeff has withdrawn from the world outside of his parents basement both physically and emotionally, and is just waiting for some sign of a purpose for his life to reveal itself. That is the good.

There are some funny scenes involving self absorbed, narcissistic shenanigans by the older brother with his new Porsche, that rightfully conclude with his comeuppance. But don't be fooled into thinking this is going to be ""the Office"" style comedy. Once the Porsche is gone, so are the laughs.

The Mothers storyline, highlighting her loneliness was ok, but I would have liked it better without her and her new romantic interest basically destroying their workplace, and causing incredible damage by stetting off the sprinklers so that they could have a cute first kiss. I just do not find selfishness of that magnitude to be attractive. Couldnt you just go to a park and kiss in a fountain, or under some lawn sprinklers, or pull her into the workplace gym shower or something?

The real killer for me was the older brother. Here is a man who is such an insensitive jerk (and that is being kind) that at the moment his emotionally withdrawn brother finally makes and effort to come out from himself, and connect with him over their both having the same dream about their dead father, lashes out at him, and tells him he is a stupid stoner, a loser, and the dream means nothing. Then in a subsequent scene when his marriage is on the brink of destruction, and his tearful wife is trying to explain how she feels, he responds by cutting her off to tell her he will ""try to listen to her stupid, inane babblings and pretend they mean something."" That is level 10,000 insensitivity and I cannot imagine how her heart would not slam shut forever.
To really like this movie I would have to believe that the older brother could change who he is on a dime, and I don't see how that is possible. That is the bridge too far.

Without giving away the ending, though they tried to wrap everything up with a pretty, only in Hollywood, happy ever after bow, I felt rather empty. With little hope for anyone other than Jeff.",1475193600,,2528,4.598669623059867

5096114,3,B007L6VPL4,"""Everyone and everything is interconnected in this universe.  Stay pure of heart and you will see the signs.  Follow the signs, and you will uncover your destiny.""  --Jeff

Understand, 2011's ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" is a harmless, unassuming little comedy that should bring a few smiles to your face.

Now, think about the title.  You've seen the movie, haven't you?  No?  Well, you've heard of it, I'm sure.  No, again?  The fact is, ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" is hardly the kind of title that would get audiences flocking to movie theaters.  And it didn't.  The movie cost a relatively meager ten million to make, yet it didn't even recover half of that at the box office.  It was an undeserving fate for a movie that is really quite charming.

""Jeff"" comes to us from the Duplass brothers, Jay and Mark, who wrote and directed it.  You might remember the Duplasses from ""The Puffy Chair,"" ""Baghead,"" or ""Cyrus.""  They do small, quirky, indie-type films that, admittedly, have a limited appeal compared to the outrageous, sex-and-smut-filled comedies that have proliferated in the Judd Apatow world of celluloid fun and games.

Jason Segel (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""How I Met Your Mother"") stars as Jeff, a quintessential slacker.  He's thirty years old, single, out of work by choice, living in his mother's basement, smoking weed.  Jeff's favorite movie is M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" because, he says, the film's seemingly random events all comes together at the end.  Jeff wonders about his own fate and his own end, so he looks for signs everywhere.  He is looking for meaning, any kind of meaning, in his life, and to that end believes that everything in this world is interrelated.  Apparently, he would adore Kiefer Sutherland's TV series ""Touch"" if he ever saw it.  And fans of ""Touch"" might like this film as well, since it predates the television show by a year or so and deals in the same basic ideas.

Anyway, Jeff gets a call one morning from a guy wanting to speak with someone named ""Kevin.""  Jeff tells the fellow he's gotten a wrong number, but he feels it's a sign.  He becomes obsessed with finding a ""Kevin"" to see where that sign will lead him, even to following around a kid with ""Kevin"" written on his jersey and then hopping aboard a ""Kevin Kandy"" delivery truck.  Why does Jeff believe so intently in the power of signs?  Maybe it's because he sees his own life is so empty that he wants desperately to believe there is some cosmic order in the universe that eventually will make everything right.  He maintains a naive, stubborn, innocent belief that all things have a purpose, that nature has a universal plan for all of us.

Ed Helms (""The Hangover,"" ""Cedar Rapids"") plays Jeff's brother Pat, who is the opposite of Jeff; he's married, with a job and apartment.  But his life is just as messed up, aimless, and empty as Jeff's is.  He's just bought a Porsche Boxster he can't afford, and his wife (Judy Greer) is pissed.  What's more, he sees his wife with another man and feels sure she's cheating on him.  He, too, is unhappy.

Then, Susan Sarandon (""Bull Durham,"" ""Thelma & Louise""), beautiful as ever, plays Jeff and Pat's mother.  She is also unhappy:  A widow working in a cubicle office, feeling, as her sons do, that her life is unfulfilled.  Furthermore, she has a ""secret admirer"" sending her e-mails, which both flatters and annoys her.  Jeff, of course, sees all of these seemingly random events in his and his family's life as somehow connected.  He might be right.

""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" is sweet, warmhearted, meandering, slow, and most often humorous.  Most important, it all seems to work under the watchful eyes of the Duplass brothers, who never let it wander too far astray, never become sentimental, trite, or overly moralistic.  And the cast is spot on, each of them contributing little gems of performances.

Some of the movie is silly, to be sure.  Some of it is touching.  Most of it is gently amusing.  Then, we get an ending that is entirely unlikely yet draws things to a poignant conclusion.  As I say, it's a sweet film.

Video:
Paramount's video engineers reproduce the movie on Blu-ray in its native 1.85:1 dimensions using a single-layer BD25 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec.  However, because the filmmakers used digital cameras for the shoot, the results are predictably soft and flat.  The colors can be odd, too, sometimes bright and natural, sometimes afflicted by a questionably intentional yellowish tinge.  The cinematography is typical of so many indie-type films; that is, it's often self-conscious, the camera often jerking in and out, with lots of close-ups and long, lingering shots.  There is not a great deal of detail in the medium and longer shots, some scenes even appearing murky or blurry; yet a few of the close-ups can look absolutely perfect.  Therefore, the PQ varies.  The screen is very clean, and that's about it.

Audio:
The movie is practically all dialogue, so the lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio has little to do.  You get mostly center-channel midrange.  A little background musical bloom seeps in at times, unobtrusively, almost silently, and occupies a tiny bit of surround space.  Otherwise, the sound is smooth and quiet, and that's about it.

Extras:
There's almost nothing here.  The disc comes with a redemption code for downloading a standard-definition version of the film via UltraViolet for your TV, computer, tablet, or Smartphone, the offer ending June 19, 2013.  In addition, there are fourteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; English audio descriptions; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  And that's about it.  Incidentally, the disc comes housed in a solid Blu-ray case, not a flimsy, cutout Eco-case.

Parting Thoughts:
Who knows?  Maybe we are all connected to one another in some way and everything truly is related, after all.  That seems entirely beside the point in ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home,"" which merely uses the conceit as a plot device to tell a perfectly engaging little story of how people can and should interact with one another.  While the film may be Pollyannaish in its sentiments, maybe it really is a good life if we want it to be.

Great movie?  No.  Good movie?  Yes.  Even though at eighty-two minutes it is little more than a weekly television episode, it is fun while it lasts.",1433808000,,6400,4.848428835489834

5096146,3,B007L6VPL4,"What is a comedy about a 30 year old who lives in his mothers basement supposed to feel like? Where
is it supposed to go? Jeff, Who Lives at Home is the latest film from Jay and Mark Duplass. Who? you
ask. The Duplass brothers are the creative team whose first big film was Cyrus (2010), which was about a
mother (played by Oscar winner Marisa Tomei) who smothers her son (played by Jonah Hill)--and it was
a very awkward movie. Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a lot less awkward, but it is chock full of juvenile
moments that have you wondering why you're even in the theater. In the end, however, it redeems
itself (though just barely).

Jeff is played by Jason Segal of How I Met Your Mother fame, and the film opens with him sitting in his
mothers basement (where he lives, get it?). Hes smoking (you know, smoking) and contemplating his
life. He is plagued by the gnawing feeling that his life is supposed to mean something but what? He gets
a call from someone who dialed the wrong number call asking for Kevin (read on, strangely enough its
important later). Then his mother (played by Oscar winner and Cape May Film Festival Honoree Susan
Sarandon) bugs him to go buy glue and fix something in the house.

In addition to buying glue, Jeff is on a mission to find out what the call for Kevin meant. Somehow in
his travels, Jeff meets up with his brother, played by Ed Helms (of The Office and The Daily Show). One
thing leads ridiculously to another, and I was on the edge of my seatmainly because I was getting
ready to leave the theater. A couple more turns in the direction of the inane, and I would have left. But
the film took a less juvenile turn with some lines (nearly whole scenes) that were actually close to
poignant.

The audience applauded at the end, so something must have struck a nerve. Sarandon was wasted with
a disconnected subplot that awkwardly worked its way back into the storyline. How do the Duplass
brothers sign on this Oscar talent? Still, I cant say it was all badanother quirky film from two equally
quirky brothers.",1408406400,,2049,4.444148936170213

Jeff starts his day with an insistent phone call for Kevin.  Jeff wonders if this is a 'sign', since he's just watched Mel Gibson's movie, 'Signs'.  He decides it is shortly thereafter, and we are led through the day, with references to Kevin in almost every step he makes, no matter how intentional or unintentional.

It's an interesting day, and has quite an ending.  There are some scenes and storylines that seem like they were thrown in for added length to the movie, but it was still an enjoyable movie.

5096237,4,B007L6VPL4,"I love Jason Segel's character Marshall, in HIMYM, and I saw a few similarities between Marshall and Segel's character, Jeff, here in this movie. Jeff is a bum who lives in his mother's basement, and his brother Pat is married, has an apartment and a job, and just bought a Porsche. However, Jeff seems to be the more kindhearted of the two, believes in destiny and fate, and spends the whole movie in sweatshirt and shorts. This quirky film takes Jeff and Pat on an eccentric journey that strengthens the bond of brotherhood between them more than ever before. Pat has to learn how to love his wife (played by Judy Greer -- 13 Going on 30; 27 Dresses) better, and Jeff follows the strange clue of the random name ""Kevin"" that he believes destiny has sent him. While this is going, their mother (played by Susan Sarandon -- The Lovely Bones, Little Women, Shall We Dance, The Company You Keep) seems to have a secret admirer at work. This is a very funny film, dotted with swearing language - and except for the F-bombs I would have loved this film.

Nevertheless it still succeeded even though it wasn't your traditional comedy.  I don't like the word ""dramedy"", but this movie is a big reason why that word comes to mind. The opening with the quote by Jeff set the entire tone of the movie for me.  It was a movie showcasing fate, humility, sensitivity, love, and a whole plethora of feelings of the human psyche.  Quite frankly I was thinking it was going to be a hilarious comedy about a pot-head living with his mom getting by in life, and it was to a slight degree, but not in the sense I thought it would be.  From an acting standpoint it wasn't the best I've seen of Jason Segel - he did seem as if he was sleep-walking through the film - that's why it loses a star.

But Oscar-winner Sarandon may actually be more of a liability than an asset here; I mean, what's she doing in this barely impressionable, lightweight, sporadically entertaining movie?  In other words, her presence as an Oscar winner actually makes you more aware of the movie's flaws.  It actually reminds me of a ""My Name is Earl"" episode, just stretched into a movie, whether or not the script was complete, or so it seems.  It finally has some substance, though, in about the last 30 minutes (which, I guess,  may mean it's actually one-third baked, LOL), so that's a plus.

The character of his brother is over the top, but not beyond reality. The character is annoying, but might be a familiar family member to some.

I truly thought this was going to be a comedy that was perhaps a twist between 'Step-Brothers' and 'Everything Must Go', instead I was pulled in a million directions with no glimmer of hope for laughter by a stoner with ADD. There's a great selection of cast members who've all proven in past films/ shows that they can either act or be funny, but something went wrong in this film. Jason Segel truly achieved being lost which only made me bored, Ed Helms was just an all out idiot (and not in a funny way), Judy Greer was simply pathetic and Susan Sarandon turns into a 50 something lesbian with her co-worker. I mean what was going on when they wrote the plot of this movie?? I understand Jeff searching for the meaning of his life but it seems the writers/ directors thought the only way of showing the audience this was by making a film with no true turmoil or profound search for his meaning in life.

The plot in general was bland and boring, nothing of note happens until the end of the movies, where everything happens to come together into a predictable and rather anti climatic conclusion.

But now that I've seen it, I can assure you it's worth the watch if you're looking for a comedy that looks at the bigger picture and doesn't rely on cheap jokes.

Yes, Segal is playing the stoner ""loser,"" once again and Ed Helms is playing a self-righteous prick (again), but the Duplass brothers have created a film that elevates these stereotypical characters by placing them in a overarching theme of the interconnections of the universe. If you've seen Safety Not Guaranteed, this film will leave you similarly heart-warmed albeit way less confused than after watching Safety Not Guaranteed.

5096447,5,B007L6VPL4,"The most unusual and surprising movie I've seen recently is this story of two brothers and ther mom.

Jeff is a 30-year-old bong smoker still living in the basement. Brother Pat selfishly buys a Jaguar when his wife wanted to get a house. They fight and soon after, he sees her going into a restaurant with another man. Pat enlists Jeff's aid in spying on his wife, but the stoner is only so helpful, for he has his own obsession: the name Kevin.

Meanwhile, their lonely mom is getting flirty IM's on the job from an anonymous co-worker.

Dont wanna give away too much of the plot. Love the way it transitions from dumb comedy, to introspection, to heroic actioner, and finally in the last moment, mysticism. Can't recommend this feel good film too highly!

Written and directed by Jay and Mark Duplass. (Two guys also obsessed with someone named Kevin.)

But then the ending arrived, and just really brought the whole thing together, and was just a terrific ending for the story, loved it.

The movie was a bit slow throughout the majority of the plot, but the ending was well worth the wait.  Probably not an exciting movie for a Friday/Saturday night,...this is more of ""Monday night kind of movie.""

5096580,4,B007L6VPL4,"It took me a while to decide to watch this movie because of the low reviews, but I'm glad I took the chance. The worst of the  reviews claim the movie is slow/boring, but at less than an hour and a half, I can't see the argument. It's a part of a day in someone's life and the pacing fits well. There are some moments of quiet that you're supposed to take in what they're taking in, and I felt like those moments were well-paced and not too lengthy. It isn't a ""laugh out loud"" movie, and there were two parts where I teared up some, so if you're just looking for laughs it may not be for you. It's the sort of ""offbeat"" comedy that isn't really supposed to make you laugh out loud, though, so I wasn't disappointed. I think all the parts were well-cast, and Rae Dawn Chong was a delightful surprise. This movie has a great spirit, in my opinion, and it's not trying to be more than what it is or make some huge claim or morality tale. It's a fun, gentle movie that ebbs and flows and I enjoyed the journey.",1365292800,,1007,4.111675126903553

I figured that it was worth a try based on the star power: current leading funny men Jason Segal and Ed Helms and the once and still gorgeous redhead Susan Sarandon.

I was taken from the opening scenes and I sighed a wistful sigh upon the closing credits. A slow, but rarely plodding story in the day in the life of Jeff and all of the characters who inhabit his world. Maybe a bit too sappy for some, I thought that it hit all of the right notes in the characters and plot line.

The kind of movie Hollywood cannot seem to make, brought to by Indian Paintbrush and the Duplass brothers. A film by brothers, about brothers.

Sarandon is an interesting mother/widower, who is also looking for meaning in her life, struggling with her job and a son who seems lost in the world.  It is a little inane at the beginning, and you'll want to give up on it, but don't.  It all makes sense by the end, and the acting is natural and familiar.",1363046400,,523,4.494736842105263

5096709,5,B007L6VPL4,"Jeff, Who Lives At Home follows brothers Jeff, a 30 year old stoner living in his mother's basement, and Pat, a moderately successful man with a failing marriage. Jeff has a unique outlook on life, where he believes everything happens for a reason and random events can be perceived as signs; Jeff coincidentally runs into Pat, and a chain reaction of events occurs. Jeff, Who Lives At Home is a funny, thought-provoking, and compelling film, with comedy and drama.

The story in this film is very immersive and compelling. The film blends drama and comedy, and manages to stay balanced. The comedy in this film is often subtle; although I mentioned a ""stoner"" early, don't expect a stoner comedy or something raunchy (like Pineapple Express or Harold and Kumar.) This story has a lot of heart, allowing it to be genuinely compelling; this film has the ability to make you think about your lifestyle, and potentially change or challenge the way you think. Jason Segel and Ed Helms give fantastic performances and have great chemistry, and the rest of the acting was great, as well.

Overall, Jeff, Who Lives at Home is an amazing comedy/drama, supported by two wonderful performances and a thought-provoking theme. As of 1/3/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, although I highly recommend a purchase.

This film has some blood and violence.",1361923200,,1384,4.956896551724138

It really was not funny ... there were some chuckle moments, but no real out and out laughs.  The story was kind of pleasant and positive, though manipulative and formulaic.

I'd suggest this movie when it is raining or you are stuck indoors as I was.  I was not feeling well yesterday. coming down with the flu so just wanted something entertaining to watch that I had not seen before ... this was a good movie for that.  It held my interest and I did not get bored watching it and even mildly got into it.  I liked it even ... but it was not a 4 or a 5, but also not a 1 or a 2 ... so 3/5 is what I give it, some will love it others will hate it, but it is not terrible as some have said or really great, it's a medium watchable sort of light dramedy.

This is a movie for and about what family's ARE, difficult to understand and accept each other for who and what they are. Susan Sarandon is great.

5096808,4,B007L6VPL4,"I was referred to this film after watching ""Young Adult"". While I was expecting something darker, this film ended up being different from most main-streamers. After reading all of the horrid one-star reviews, I decided to stand up for the film.

""Jeff Who Lives at Home"" takes you on a journey--the journey of Jeff. He is obsessed with the movie ""Signs"" and we clearly see that in the first minutes of the film where he is tape recording his thoughts while on the toilet. We then see his mother call him on her birthday from work, pleading for him to do ONE thing on his birthday...fix the cabinet. Yes, he is THAT type of son. She left him money on the counter and this is where his journey begins. He gets on the bus and we see the way his mind works, trying to connect the pieces of his life together. He whimsically follows his instincts and in the process ends up helping his brother catch his cheating wife, but also ends up doing much more. In the very last minutes of the film, it turns out Jeff is EXACTLY where he needs to be and all the signs have led him to his destiny. Jeff's good intentions even end up leaving a chance of redemption for his brother, the character that I think most people would hate.

I would be remiss if I did not mention that we also follow Jeff's mother in scenes where she is at work, working as a comparison to Jeff. She is looking for signs as well, but doesn't realize it. By the end of the film, she has found an unexpected surprise as well. Her character nicely ties the idea of destiny up along with the rest of the cast.

My last notes: I've found with movies like this, where there is actual reflection and thought, where they aren't just a predictable, laugh every fifteen seconds as the punchlines come, that lots of people get disappointed. So, if you are looking for ""The Hangover"", watch ""The Hangover"". If you are looking for something different, take a few to enjoy ""Jeff Who Lives at Home"".",1360108800,,1944,4.379501385041551

5096882,5,B007L6VPL4,"""Jeff Who Lives At Home"" begins with a simple concept.  Our hero Jeff (Jason Segel) sits in his mother's basement toking a water pipe pondering the meaning of life.  A wrong number asking for Kevin sets off a chain of events.  In Jeff's mind there has to be a reason for someone asking for Kevin.  Off the couch Jeff goes in a series of adventures for some kind of cosmic significance and in the process gives meaning to his life and helps repair his brother Pat's(Ed Helms) strained marriage and give his widowed mother (Susan Sarandon) some degree of happiness.  Director-writers Mark and Jay Duplass are not trying to change the game with this film but in an unpretentious way create movie magic.  It helps that Segel's Jeff is an amiable sort instead of a cliched slacker.  And what fountain of youth is Sarandon drinking from?  She may be in her mid-sixties but she looks about twenty years younger.  This is a small film with big heart.",1358467200,6,942,4.592814371257485

Basically, a family that never quite recovered the loss of a father has become dysfuntional as a family unit and as depressed as individuals.  Things get worse and then they get better -  mostly due to Jeff the slacker's adherence to his philosophy of interpereting and following metaphysical signs.

The cast is a huge strength here. The script is quirky but the characters are realistic and likeable despite their faults.  The ending provides a great resolution to the ideas and problems presented in the first act, tying it all together through the viewpoint of the protagonist.

5096929,3,B007L6VPL4,"...there you are. This might sound like a glib expression on the surface but it digs deeper than that. Some argue free will over pre-destination but I don't see the two as being mutually exclusive. There is a pre-determined point in all our futures, but that point exists because of the choices we make. It's not a point created by an outside force and that is part of what is going on in this movie.

Here's the scoop. Jeff (Jason Segel) is 30 years old, lives in his mom's basement and smokes a lot of pot. He has never gotten over the trauma of losing his father and looks for 'signs' that will point him to his destiny. His brother Pat (Ed Helms) keeps screwing up his relationship with his wife (Judy Greer) by always putting himself first. Mom (Susan Sarandon), who also never got over her husband's death, is frustrated in trying to get Jeff motivated to perform even the most rudimentary of tasks. She suddenly finds herself with a secret admirer in her office. Signs that Jeff sees (or thinks he sees) lead to a situation where Pat thinks his wife might be cheating on him. The ensuing adventure helps point everyone to what might be their destiny.

Though maybe not a great movie, this still deserves a look. The Duplass brothers are onto something in that the adventures they depict aren't that big, but they're bigger than the player's everyday lives. And they do manage to involve the viewer. Jeff's looking for signs leads him to the adventure, but it's his decision to follow those signs that, in fact, leads him to, what he feels, is his destiny. Helms is good as Pat. He's mildly successful but wants way more than he should, and more than his home can sustain. In this instance, it's a Porsche he can nowhere near afford. Sarandon is always good. Her frustration is palpable here. She just needs to get back on the horse, even if it's a horse of a different color. The filming is very low key. It gives the viewer the sense of being with the characters. I liked the music score as well. It was dotted with some nifty, indy-ish tunes. The ending is more than a bit pat but somehow I didn't mind. Because, in the end, we all want to be close with those who are the most important to us.

5096985,4,B007L6VPL4,"Jeff (Jason Segal) is someone who believes in the divine, that there is a reason for everything and everyone has a unique destiny to fulfill if only they follow the signs. Jeff is also an unemployed 30-year old living in his mother's basement, so yeah, there's that. Jeff's brother, Pat (Ed Helms), is a clueless salesman who doesn't realize his marriage is on the rocks until the day he catches his wife (Judy Greer) with another man. Jeff's mom (Susan Sarandon) struggles to deal with her two deadbeat sons. Throughout the course of that day, Jeff and Pat are determined to find out if Pat's wife is having an affair. Instead, their journey allows them to find themselves and each other.

When I saw that the cast consisted of Jason Segal, Ed Helms and Judy Greer, my thoughts immediately drifted to Judd Apatow's raunchy productions. Friends, don't let the title or casting fool you, this movie is no such thing. I can't ever recall watching something directed by the Duplass brothers so this was my first experience with their style of directing. Though it wasn't quite what I expected, admittedly, I was impressed. I thought this movie was going to be your run-of-the-mill comedy with little meaning or value, but I was mistaken. Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a dramedy that functions as a character study more than anything. It takes us deep into the lives of three exceedingly unhappy people and their meaningless existences. There were definitely comedic moments but the movie also had me crying at the very end (which is a rarity for me).

Another notable thing is the lack of a big budget which allows for the focus to be more on the dialogue and in character development. But this isn't a problem because it's these things that make the movie so special. The Duplass brothers have shown us seemingly unlikable characters and managed by the end of the film to make them very likable. This is also a testament to the strength of the actors as well. Segal, Helms and Sarandon are totally believable in their portrayal of the unhappy family dynamic and yet are still completely charming at the same time. They are realistically flawed and they suffer, lacking in purpose and looking for redemption. The Duplass brothers use that suffering to fuel much of the comedy in the film and the juxtaposition, in this case, works. These characters get you thinking and reflecting on their growth both as individuals and as a family.

I think the thing that is most impressive about the film is how it begins with a sign (the movie Signs, actually) and each action and interaction builds upon the one before it. Jeff, Who Lives at Home starts off with the characters, each on their own, but during the course of the film their stories steadily collide and intertwine, showing us that these people are more connected than they ever realized. Fate is a key theme here and all events culminate in them figuring out what his/her own destiny really is. It's a truly remarkable movie because of its honesty and sincerity. It will tickle both your funny bone and your heartstrings.

Food for Thought: Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a bit of a thinker that leaves you reeling by the very end. It's an endearing story about destiny, family and love. Chalk full of smart humour, it's totally worth the time if you're looking for a memorable film that takes a deeper look into the flaws of man (and woman). If you're looking for hope, watch this film, like right now.

5096986,4,B007L6VPL4,"Jeff is 30 successfully unemployed and living in his mothers basement experimenting with recreational drugs and watching the TV. Then one day he takes a wrong number call for someone called `Kevin' and decides it is a sign as per his fave film that Mel Gibson `classic' `Signs', you know the one with the crop circles. He is one of these people who thinks everything happens for a reason and so this random moment will lead him to his possible destiny. This thankfully occurs when he sees a teenager on a bus with `Kevin' on his T - Shirt, so as any sane person would do, he sets off in hot (well luke warm) pursuit.

Jeff (Jason Segel of `I Love You Man' and `Forgetting Sarah Marshall') also has a brother Pat (Ed Helms `The Hangover), who is at a turning point in his relationship. Despite the state of their finances he thinks that buying a Porsche will help, but then he sees his wife with another man. Enlisting the help of Jeff they set off in warmish pursuit of the pair. Meanwhile their long suffering mum played by the wonderful Susan Sarandon ( I love her because she was in `The Rocky Horror Picture Show') is in a job with a secret admirer and she thinks things might be looking up, if only she could get her lazy son off the sofa.

This is a movie that wants to be quirky and it sort of gets there and it wants to be funny and I did laugh on at least two occasions, but it was more the schadenfreude kind of thing, where you laugh at others misfortunes, which is what the movie was playing for. It is though a caring film; relationships are at the core as well as misplaced value in material things and the belief that looking at things from a different angle can bring massive rewards.

It has a run time of just under an hour and a half and it flows by in a reassured pace. I actually quite enjoyed it, this is not laugh out loud or `riotous' but it is warm, amusing and ultimately entertaining, the sort that warms the cockles of your heart as they used to say in my Grand dads day.",1351641600,,1999,4.241469816272966
5096987,2,B007L6VPL4,"You can't beat a cast like Jason Segel, Ed Helms, and Susan Sarandon. A film that seems like it will be a lot of fun is dragged down but its own story. Jeff is a 30-year old loser who still lives at home with his mother. His brother Pat is destroying and already fading marriage. Their mother works in an office whose dreary routine is suddenly spiced up by a secret admirer in her office. Nothing out of the ordinary or exciting here and one wonders ""What's the point?"" Also, ""what were the actors thinking?"" Here is a low budget independet film that is propped up by a big name cast.
Jeff becomes obsessed with finding the meaning of Kevin. Maybe that would have been a better title for the film. ""THE MEANING OF KEVIN."" An angry caller reaches Jeff by mistake and demands to talk to Kevin. Suddenly, Jeff sees ""Kevin"" as a sign and he goes out on a Kevin hunt--attracted by anyone or anything named Kevin. In this gallant search for the meaning of Kevin, Jeff's life collides with his estranged brother Pat and indirectly with their month.
Now, there could be a funny story here if everyone wasn't so obsessive about what they are obsessing about. The family dynamics are not fully explained so we are left in a cloud of confusion. Susan Sarandon does a fine job in making her ininspired character more interesting. JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME is a big disappointment. A talented cast goes to waste as we trudge along to hope that by the end we'll understand the meaning of KEVIN.

5097018,5,B007L6VPL4,"I don't review many movies, and will leave the synopsis to the people who have already reviewed and done a great job at it. I will however, say that  I was so impressed by this movie. Its messages are potentially life changing. I loved Jeff, appreciated his mom's (Susan Sarandon) frustration with him being 30 with no seeming direction in his life. Her husband had passed away some years ago and she is now ready for companionship. Her openness and innocence in her search was poignant and beautiful (plus she is one of my favorite actresses of all time!). The end result of her search was surprising, but somehow so right. My own husband was quite ill at the time I saw this movie, and has subsequently passed away. I related to her lonliness and need for companionship and have thought about and recommended this movie to several people. I have had lively conversations with them about the different messages that are sprinkled throughout the movie. I love, love, LOVED the ending. I was overjoyed to see Jeff fulfilled in his search for his own 'signs'. I even loved the obnoxious brother and his finally seeing the 'light'. Jeff kept giving him really good advice, which was largely ignored because he was so focused on Jeff being just a lazy stoner, and wasn't paying attention to anything but his own selfish motivations. It was fun to see that in the end he realized that Jeff had been right. He wound up with a new found respect for his brother, which was so good to see. I think the filming could have been a little better, but I was so happy with all the stories going on in the movie that I hardly noticed that it wasn't super pro.

5097019,3,B007L6VPL4,"I had heard many good things about this movie since it came out.
And...
We have Jeff the 30 year old slacker who lives at home with mom.
His (totally hot) brother Ed Helms (Pat) who is kinda sorta successful but not really.
And their mom, who seems to be at the end of her wits with just about everything and everyone.
I'll say it, I loved Jeff.
Stoner, slacker...the guys epitomizes the ""big loveable goof"" stereotype.
So why only three stars?
Well, it was a good movie just not great.
The story telling is somewhat lazy and uninspired.
The acting is fine, direction, score etc...
It's just that the story drags and really isn't here nor there.
It just sort of is....
Jeff likes to fantasize about finding his destiny and that's pretty much what the movie is like. Watching Jeff fulfill his destiny.
I think Jeff nails it right on the head toward the end of the film when he says something to the effect of...""You find out your destiny is kind of boring"" or something like that.
And he was right...it WAS boring.
If you love indie films then you might like this.
What Jeff lacks in the story department he more than makes up in heart.

5097020,4,B007L6VPL4,"This was an unexpected delight of a film. It starts with Jeff, who lives ""at home"" with his mother, apparently in the basement flat, receiving a wrong-number phone call. The phone rings and Jeff, stoned on marijuana, answers. The caller asks for Kevin. So it's a wrong number, right? Not from Jeff's point of view. He sees this as a call from Destiny, and so he starts looking for the cosmic connection. The first Kevin he encounters robs him. The second Kevin unknowingly leads him to an encounter that will change his (Jeff's) brother's life. For the better. Throughout, Jeff's brother Pat and Jeff's mother either subtly or overtly dismiss  Jeff, particularly since he ""lives at home"" and is not, in their eyes, a fully functioning, responsible adult.

But as it turns out, living at home means listening: being in touch with your ""home"" -- your core self, your core values. By listening to messages (from other people, from the universe), Jeff behaves as a good person would. At the end, he meets the Kevin that Destiny led him to, and that meeting is a life-saving event.

5097025,4,B007L6VPL4,"Jeff, played by Jason Segel, does in fact live at his home with his mother, Sharon (Susan Sarandon.)  Sharon is fed up with his slacker life, and Jeff is waiting for Fate to give him a purpose in life.  Meanwhile, Jeff's brother Pat (Ed Helms) is dealing with a crumbling marriage to Linda (Judy Greer).  Ed further alienates his wife when he makes a very ill-advised purchase of a Porsche, which is far outside of the couple's budget.

The film's main focus is the relationship between the brothers.  Initially, the brothers squabble, and it's clear Pat has no respect for Jeff's lifestyle.  Nevertheless, Pat enlists Jeff's help when he believes his wife is cheating on him, and the two embark on a comical chase of Pat's wife and her suspected lover across the city.

The acting was universally good, and the story was original.  In particular, I thought Helms was great in his depiction of a man who feels both disconnected from his wife and terrified at the thought of losing her.  I enjoyed the relationship between the two brothers.  Like many siblings, they don't always get along, and they are not always kind to each other, but their mutual devotion was touching.

What worked less well was Sarandon's story line.  It's not exactly easy to believe the still-beautiful woman as a frumpy, lovelorn cubicle dweller.  She has a secret admirer in the office, and she's convinced that she's so unattractive and old that this must be a joke.  I think the reveal was meant to be shocking, but the identity of the ""secret"" admirer was immediately obvious to me.  This whole plot seemed unnecessary and tacked on, just to give Sarandon something to do.

5097126,5,B007L6VPL4,"It's unfortunate that a film that like this doesn't get the marketing and attention of other films.

This film in many ways is about people who have forgotten how to enjoy their lives and forgotten that some of the best sources of enjoyment come from emotionally connecting to the people right in front of them.
The film does a great job of unfolding its story in quiet, understated moments as well as hilarious outbursts.

This review may contain spoilers after this point.

Jeff is unemployed and searching for meaning in his life.  He does the best that he can (given where he is mentally at this point in time) and literally takes any signs he might be getting and follows them for better or worse.  At least he is trying.

His brother, Pat, ignores all signs including traffic signs but more importantly he ignores the emotional needs of the people in his life until he is on the brink of losing them.  For the most part, he is busy tending to his own vanity and his need to feel like someone who has things together when in reality his marriage is falling apart and he's disconnected from his family because he's relegated his wife and brother to the status of people who are too stupid to listen to and his mother to person whose requests are too unimportant to follow.

The mother's story is not as well developed as those of the brothers.  Her life is that of frustration with her sons and an implied loneliness.

We learn later in a pivotal scene between the brothers that her husband/their father has passed away and therein may be their impetus for all their sorrows and emotional isolation.

Through a series of events (intriguing, hilarious, some outrageous but still possible) to all three, they all reach a point of vulnerability and realization that allows them to open themselves emotionally.  For Jeff, he leaves the basement for the hardware store to begrudgingly help his mother with an errand and ends up forgetting the protective cocoon of the basement altogether, throwing himself deep into the waters of concern for complete strangers.  For Pat, the destruction of his vanity in the form of his new car in the pursuit of his wife is a symbol of his innate caring that he has forgotten.  His risking his own life for his brother is also a reflection of forgotten but still existent feelings.  For their mother, Sharon, it takes the kindness of a friend to open her heart to a new source of emotional fulfillment.

This is a feel-good film.  It is a clever, well-told, funny, feel-good film about removing oneself from the emotional isolation that can result from the pain of losing someone.  It is also a film about not losing the only people that you have.",1343520000,2,2681,4.656050955414012

5097149,4,B007L6VPL4,"I wasn't a big fan of brothers Duplass' last film, ""Cyrus"" and based on the trailers I was concerned I might be getting a repeat.  In this movie we still get the offbeat characters, but they tend to be more likable, if flawed. At least I found myself rooting for them.  Jeff (Jason Segel) is 30 and lives in the basement of his mother's house.  He isn't happy and is unemployed from what I can tell.  He's obsessed with the Shyamalan movie ""Signs"" (2002).  Aided by heavy doses of pot, Jeff believes the name Kevin is a sign for him leading perhaps to a better life.  So he follows anything or anyone with the name Kevin.

His older brother Pat (Ed Helms) is married to Linda (Judy Greer) but their union is in jeopardy.  Lack of communication seems to be the problem as Pat doesn't listen and just talks past Linda on issues.  He buys a Porsche on his limited income.  Linda wants to save for a house.  Yeah, he's a jerk.

The majority of the film deals with chance meetings of the brothers, Linda and the boy's mother, Sharon (an excellent Susan Sarandon).  Sharon's scenes deal with a potential office admirer and Sarandon plays them with the charm and sophistication she's perfected.  Without question this is a small movie with wit and an occasional bite.  The movie's conclusion, I thought was a perfect and brought the whole movie together.  Nice film.  Well constructed, well written, well made.

The Blu ray transfer provides an excellent 1080p picture.  From what I can tell, the movie was shot using high definition video cameras rather than film.  Still it looks crisp and clear in every aspect.  While it has a slightly harder edge than what you see in film, I have no complaints.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

First, the other reviewers who mention the overuse of the ""hand cam"" effect are correct. It is frequent and distracting. It started to feel like a bad TMZ episode after a while.

Perhaps they were trying to inject an Ed Helms / The Office sort of feel. . .if so, it did not work, in my opinion. I won't say much about the storyline, except that it deals with everyday issues like love, life and work. There are a few genuinely funny moments, though probably not enough considering the overall capabilities of this cast.

5097162,3,B007L6VPL4,"Truthfully, you won't miss much by skipping his movie. It's better than, say, Avatar (less idiotic plot, less cartoony characters), but not as good as, say, The Hangover, Due Date, 21 Jump Street (which was surprisingly hilarious and smart, though somewhat raunchy). Yes, they crashed a Porsche, but there's just too many coincidences. Although Jeff lives by Mel Gibson's ""Signs"", looking for how things in life fit together, it lacks the metaphysical framework which made Gibson's movie work (even if you hated it). Here, there's no higher power orchestrating those coincidences, so it all feels contrived to lead us along the different points to be checked off along the way.

Your enjoyment of this movie may be tempered by the token lesbian kiss. Yes, that's right, this film is now officially ""edgy"" and ""relevant"". But it may also be a criticism of how selfish and thoughtless a particular character is - plus inconsiderate of the safety and property of others - destroying thousands of dollars of other people's stuff for a ""romantic"" scene.

You do feel for the characters in their predicaments and longings, but the answers are too flip and simpleminded. The ending, likewise, ties everything neatly together. Watch for the red cars. Wow, really deep.

It was cute, somewhat contrived, and, of course, someone's shouting in a megaphone in your ear about lifestyles. Worth perhaps a $1 rental.",1340841600,2,1401,5.082608695652174
5097163,4,B007L6VPL4,"This was another one of those movies that I missed when it went into theaters, and it was also a film I really wanted to see. I'm a huge fan of Jason Segel's (Jeff) work, so naturally I wanted to see this. However, it was nothing like I expected.

I thought we'd follow Jeff through a point of his life that covered a week, a month, or any set period of time for that matter, but that's not really what happens. We follow Jeff through one crazy day in his life. Which isn't bad, but I feel they could've done more with the character had they expanded the amount of time the movie covered in his life. On top of that the movie is really short, running just over one hour and twenty minutes.

Jeff is a 30 year old stoner who currently lives in his mothers basement. He's recently been infatuated with the movie Signs, and is taking everything that happens to be some sort of sign. Jeff's main goal is to find some sort of greater purpose for himself. He feels lost in today's world, as if there's something he's supposed to find out about himself. During the movie he is helping his brother Pat (Ed Helms) who is also going through a rough patch. Only difference is Pat has a wife, a job, and a life. Even though the movie didn't play out as I expected, I still fell in love with it. Mainly with Jeff. I feel I resemble Jeff a lot in the sense that I too am searching for what my destiny is in life, and until I do I just live life day to day. You see everyone else around you progressing in their lives, and you just feel stuck.

I don't know who did the music to the film, but it was wonderful. It definitely served its purpose in setting the perfect mood for the film. It's very lighthearted and carefree, I hope I can find the score somewhere.

The only thing I can really complain about aside from the length is how it was filmed. If you've ever watched an episode of the Office, that's the best thing to compare it to. The camera is kind of shaky and it zooms in and out on the character a few times in each shot. It doesn't make it unwatchable, but that kind of filming isn't for everyone.

Overall Score: 8/10 - Even though it didn't turn out as I expected, I still highly recommend this film. If you're into those weird comedy films that don't necessarily try to be comedies, then you will enjoy this. Overall it's a beautiful movie, and Jason Segel does an amazing job as Jeff. I can't picture anyone else playing him.",1340668800,36,2427,4.2219827586206895

5097212,5,B007L6VPL4,"The most unusual and surprising movie I've seen recently is this story of two brothers and ther mom.

Jeff is a 30-year-old bong smoker still living in the basement. Brother Pat selfishly buys a Jaguar when his wife wanted to get a house. They fight and soon after, he sees her going into a restaurant with another man. Pat enlists Jeff's aid in spying on his wife, but the stoner is only so helpful, for he has his own obsession: the name Kevin.

Meanwhile, their lonely mom is getting flirty IM's on the job from an anonymous co-worker.

Dont wanna give away too much of the plot. Love the way it transitions from dumb comedy, to introspection, to heroic actioner, and finally in the last moment, mysticism. Can't recommend this feel good film too highly!

Written and directed by Jay and Mark Duplass. (Two guys also obsessed with someone named Kevin.)

The movie was engaging from start to finish. I loved the realism, the ""presence"" of the scenes, the slow but deliberate unfolding of the plot, and the strong acting, especially that of Ed Helms.
By the time the movie was almost over, I realized it was special and that I needed to purchase a copy of it. Then, as an added bonus, the ending was completely unexpected - and incredibly powerful.

5097258,4,B007L6VPL4,"Jeff, Who Lives At Home is a tough movie on review. I enjoyed watching it, but I suspect that I will later feel embarrassed for this. It's not that the film is bad. Hardly. It's more that it is so overtly precious that it's hard to know if I'm responding to it because it truly has much to recommend it, or if I'm not just riding on the faux-sugar high of the movie's saccharine backbone.

The film follows Jeff (Jason Segel), a 30 year-old stoner who lives in his mother's (Susan Sarandon) basement. After postulating on the deeper meanings of Shyamalan's misfire,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Signs/dp/B004NDDD04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Signs</a>, Jeff is inundated with signs, starting with an ad for a multivitamin, all of which conspire to lead him to his destiny. Along the way, he crosses paths with his older brother, a jerk named Pat who is currently on the outs with his wife, Linda (Judy Greer). Simultaneously, Jeff and Pat's mother struggles with her age (it's her birthday), her loneliness (her husband died a few years ago), and a secret admirer at her workplace.

These plots intertwine in clever, sometimes funny, ways, but never without a double dose of portentous coincidence (or is it fate?). It seems like it might be tongue-in-cheek, but Jeff certainly takes the whole thing very seriously, and the end results are also not nearly as funny as they are sobering. The movie's soundtrack (a light and playful and nearly-constant stream of xylophone  music) as well as the camerawork (there are many odd twitches and zooms in and out, as if the producers wanted to add just a hint of a documentary feel) add to the film's ambiguous and nonchalant profundity.

It's perhaps best not to read too much into the story. The film is character-driven, and even though nearly every person is unlikeable or annoying in some way, they are so perfectly acted and their relationships are so solidly defined that it's a joy to watch them interact. The humor isn't forced into punchlines or jokes or even quirks. It's found in the harmonic dissonance of intersecting lives lived in different keys. These people clash, but they also complement each other. In the end, it all comes together, wrapped up with a neat, cute little bow (a la Signs), and you're left wondering if you weren't just bamboozled by an 83 minute Hallmark card.

I can see being annoyed by the film and its when-you-wish-upon-a-star mentality. It just so happens I was in the mood for that kind of low-calorie philosophizing, though, and the performances were truly touching. It's a gentle film, inoffensive but not without a tiny little kick. I predict there are many who will find it a little cheap or even downright puerile, but I predict many more will feel the opposite. I can't say either perspective is entirely wrong, but I will say that you don't have to believe either to enjoy the movie.",1339977600,2,2921,4.953061224489796

There's a lot more going on than its cover, various funny-as-hell yet real-life subplots, though the film is still tightly wounded and doesn't drift.  Adequate character development lends itself to a more genuine feel to the comedy.  Good ambiance and great fun tied to characters we can  probably all relate to.  There also a moral too, to boot.  Can't ruin it for those who haven't seen it, but I'll just say that even for someone like Jeff (who lives at home), mother nature still has a plan for him.  Mother nature has a plan for all of us, no matter how bleak or awkward at the onset of things.",1339891200,2,657,4.470588235294118

It went out of style about a week after The Blair Witch Project went to the $1 theaters over ten years ago.  Now, this ruins your film.  It was unwatchable.  It doesn't create uneasiness.

What starts as a simple trip to a hardware store begins to evolve and change the lives of everyone Jeff comes into contact with, including his brother Pat (Helms). This is another movie that is almost nothing like the preview. The preview made it seem much funnier then it was. While this did have some funny parts in it I found this movie to be more sweet and heartfelt then I expected. Some of the aspects of the movie are very serious but they are done in a way that tone it down. Segel is just about the perfect choice for this role because there is just something about him that you find disarming and comfortable no matter what he is doing. If you are looking for a typical Segel comedy this is not it. This one has more substance and heart and is very much worth watching.

I laughed out loud at least a dozen times and got a lump in my throat in the right places too. Segal and Helms are terrific as brothers. It doesn't hurt that two of my favorite actresses, Susan Sarandon and Judy Greer, are in it too, both luminous and incredibly appealing. My only minor complaint is that, unlike the Duplass brothers idols' the Coen brothers, JWLAH isn't as stylized, so when characters do wildly outrageous things (like the lengths Helms goes to try to catch his wife cheating) it's a bit harder to accept because the story seems to be taking place in a more ordinary world. But it would make a good double bill with a lower budgeted movie called Craig Quits His Day Job. Jeff is certainly a more polished film than Craig, but both are about aimless pure souls who embark on improbable epic quests.",1526169600,2,943,4.52046783625731
