2018007,5,B0001NBLVI,"This is a very difficult movie to watch. It is full of trauma a and I would not recommend it for people who have war related PTSD. However, the film has so many life lessons I think we all need to learn. This shows us what it mens to be a man who is in touch with his manhood, his ideals, his uncertainties, his possible feeliings of wondering if his life has been valuable. The beginning and ending of the film show us what the film is really about--that is, did Private Ryan earn it!  I won't givd it away but at the end of the film he and we received our answer. Wonderful acting, a marvelous film and story but one that I thought about for weeks after viewing it.",1491091200,,667,4.091603053435114

2018031,5,B0001NBLVI,"Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies to watch around Memorial Day and Veterans Day, as I think it's the best movie that makes me understand the value of sacrifice and brotherhood between members of the Armed Forces in times of war. On D-Day, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is assigned, with a small platoon unit, to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home safe and sound. Throughout this quest, the characters have to face the evil Nazi soldiers, concluding in an epic fight at the end of the movie.

This special edition, published for the 60th anniversary commemoration of D-Day, comes with 2 discs. The first disc includes the movie and its theatrical trailer. The second disc presents new materials made especially for this edition, including:
- An inside look with the filmmakers
- Looking into the past: the research, the screenplay and the vision
- The making of a platoon
- Boot camp for the cast
- Re-creating D-Day: Omaha Beach

All these new features are included only in this special edition. The disc also includes the other features previously released in the regular DVD edition. The box is made to look like a small vault, and inside it are included the official letter written by Dwight Eisenhower that was given to every soldier before they left for Omaha Beach, along with historic pictures and other accessories used by American soldiers. So if you're looking for a collector's edition of this movie, you should definitely go with this one!",1464220800,3,1491,4.8203125

2018073,5,B0001NBLVI,"This film in my opinion, must be considered one of the great films about WW11.  Along with the Band of Brothers film, and the Pacific film.  This film shows the brutality and senselessness of war.  The pointless carnage, the incredible waste of resources.  But in my view the true heart of this film is its attention to the human factor in war.  It shows how war destroys human beings emotionally and psychologically, literally stipping them bare.  Is it really any wonder that when these man returned home , they were not the same.  The experience of combat imprints itself on a persons personality and of their emotional outlook.  The civilians could never truly understand the wartime experience, because thet never faced actual combat. They simply heard about it from those who were fortunate enough to return.  I highly recommend this film to WW11 fans, it is well worth adding to one's WW11 collection.  JRV",1376784000,,913,4.87012987012987

2018075,5,B0001NBLVI,"Telling an amazing story of bravery, Saving Private Ryan is both inspiring and moving. Beginning with the invasion of Normandy on D-Day June 6, 1944, the film follows a group of American soldiers as they look for a Francis Ryan. Since all three of his brothers are dead their mission is to find him and send the private home . Despite the dangers and the subsequent deaths of many comrades, they finally complete their mission after one last heroic fight. The movie flashes forward to the present day Ryan as he kneels at the graves of those brave men who saved him. Unsure he asks his wife if he lived a good life because those soldiers payed the ultimate price for him. With director Steven Speilberg, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and other good character actors, this is a powerful war film with great battle sequences as well as amazing heroism.",1370044800,,843,4.626666666666667

2018087,5,B0001NBLVI,"Set during the Invasion of Normandy, Saving Private Ryan is a memorable movie from start to finish. It is one of the most graphic and realistic portrayals of WWII (and war in general) in cinema.  It deserves every accolade it has received. It is extremely gripping from beginning to end. 5/5  A great movie, a must see.",1361059200,,319,4.578947368421052
2018088,3,B0001NBLVI,"Frankly, I enjoyed this movie, if only for its special effects.  Obviously, great care was taken recreating the battle conditions during the D-day landings and probably this, in itself, is reason enough to see the movie.  As well, most other scenes whether or not they include actual fighting are impressively reconstructed with extensive attention paid to detail and Spielberg and the rest of his production crew certainly deserve kudos for a job well done.

Aside from this, I found the actual storyline to have many glaring weaknesses, some of which annoyed me no end simply because credibility was too often sacrificed in favour of producing an entertaining story.  Captain Miller's shortcomings as a leader, for example, become obvious from the very beginning when he is shown, under the stress of combat, to slip into periods of virtual catatonia and especially at times when resolute leadership is most necessary.  Is this a human failing we, as viewers, should sympathize with?  I don't believe so since such a condition, which Miller neglected to report to superiors, would only serve to needlessly endanger the soldiers under his command.

Speaking of soldiers under his command, Miller's leadership remained irresolute.  He sees several American infantrymen murder two Germans attempting to surrender yet does nothing.  Later, he organizes an attack on an enemy machine gun nest only to have the platoon's medic killed in the assault.  Why was a medic, a non-combatant, participating in such an action?  Shouldn't he have remained behind out of the firing line?  Neither Captain Miller, nor the writers offer any explanation.  And why was the attack organized in the first place?  When a soldier questions why the attack is even necessary, Miller answers that their mission is to win the war, or at very least, prevent the enemy emplacement from ambushing any other American troops.  What is not addressed is the fact that such an attack could very well alert other German troops in the area and jeopardize their stated and very specific mission of finding and saving Private Ryan.  And where is their radio?  Could they not have simply radioed the position of the machine gun to headquarters?  Or was radio silence to be strictly enforced?  And, if it was to be enforced, wouldn't such an attack make even less sense?  Again, the issue is not addressed.

What I found even stranger was Miller's handling of an almost open revolt among his men who do not want to continue the mission.  Under actual conditions, any competent officer would have had his NCO arrest and discipline the offending parties for cowardice and dereliction of duty.  Instead, Miller makes a wimpy and almost pathetic speech about his background and his desires to get home even offering to allow one soldier to return to headquarters without punishment.  I am almost certain that, in the real world, rewarding an act of insubordination in such a way would have tempted the rest of the platoon to demand similar treatment.

Finally Captain Miller virtually abandons his entire mission when, after finding Private Ryan, he elects to help Ryan and his men defend a French village's main bridge.  He takes Ryan's initial refusal to leave the town in stride.  Instead of simply ordering Private Ryan to obey his command and move out, he debates with his NCO whether or not they should even save Private Ryan at all.  What?  After coming all that way and losing two men in the process, he is asking such a question?  Unbelievable.  And remaining behind to defend the town?  Why?  Again, no explanation is offered.  Does the strategic value of the bridge supercede General Marshall's specific orders to find and secure Private Ryan?  Evidently.  A more logical approach would have been to evacuate all troops and simply blow the bridge especially when the observer in the bell tower indicates to Captain Miller the approach of a significant contingent of enemy troops and tanks.  Yet, instead, Miller, knowing he is outnumbered, elects to stay behind and engage in a senseless battle, losing virtually all his men and almost getting Private Ryan killed.  I am sure such an action would certainly have warranted a court-martial or, at the very least, a severe reprimand, had Miller survived.  All things considered, I suppose credibility had to be sacrificed in certain cases in order to tell an entertaining story but I can't help wondering if a little more thought had been put into the story line instead of the special effects, a more believable movie could have been made.",1358380800,2,4553,4.99601593625498

2018096,5,B0001NBLVI,"My military experience was limited. I joined the Army Reserve in 1956 right out of high school just to satisfy my draft obligation, went to Fort Leonard Wood, MO for six months of training, then did three and a half years of one-night-a-week meetings plus two weeks of summer camp once a year. So I'm no battle-hardened veteran.
But in this film, when I heard the German machine guns open up on the GIs coming into Omaha Beach, I thought, ""That's the first time I've heard the actual sound of machine guns firing since my days in Leonard Wood."" This film is probably as close to the real thing as you're apt to find. It makes the old John Wayne film ""The Longest Day"" and its depiction of that landing look like a Sunday stroll in the park.
Normally I avoid films that're violent, figuring they arouse human passions best left dormant. But I've added this film to my library because it's an accurate portrayal of just how stupid and cruel we can be to one another. And to what purpose -- I want your stuff and you want mine?

2018098,3,B0001NBLVI,"I wasn't too impressed with this film when I saw it more than a decade ago. It's a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in Normandy during World War II and subsequent battles in France. The film starts in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying. I remember that another film dealing with World War II was released at around the same time, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, which dealt with the war in the Pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie. Private Ryan opens with a now famous scene of the landing in Normandy that is very well done, but the film sort of goes downhill (though not catastrophically) from there on. The character of the German prisoner, for instance, is very crudely written and performed. I have to say, however, that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows American soldiers killing German soldiers as they were surrendering. This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things. And Spielberg shows this matter of factly, he doesn't give moral judgment on this. For this honesty, I praise the movie. But on balance, I think this movie is only fair.",1299024000,2,1445,4.6484375
2018099,4,B0001NBLVI,"After the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach, Ranger Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked to put together a platoon of his choosing and find a paratrooper from the 101st Airbourne named Private James Ryan. With the platoon of his choosing (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies) sets off in treachorous wartime France to find Private Ryan amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st Airbourne.

World War I is often considering ""The Great War"" or ""The War to End All Wars,"" but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has. For the first time during a war, films were made about the war as early as 1939. Some of the greatest war films and TV series have been based on World War 2 from The Sands of Iwo Jima to Flags of Fathers to Band of Brothers. At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.

Saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made. The opening thirty minutes of the D-Day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid. But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat. This movie truly depicts why World War 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in US history.

One of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller. Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as the green Cpl. Upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldier.

The one thing that drags this movie down though is Spielberg's slavish devotion to sentimentality. The bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie. Don't get me wrong, a former soldier's sentimentality for the one's who died to save him has it's place, I just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie. Rather, the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the war.

Overall, though, in the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw that I have with this movie, it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country. I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu-Ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.

2018103,4,B0001NBLVI,"Effective graphic art draws us in, appealing to the imagination, inviting us to participate in a viewing event.  Whatever the eye of the artist has envisioned,
the eye of the beholder brings to practical focus.  The work has to communicate sufficiently for us to relate to it.  Similarly, video portraits lose audiences
when they leave little to the imagination.  Viewers are left with nothing to do
but sit there, virtually motionless, in contrast to the multiplicity of actions that flow mercilessly across the screen.

For people who have never experienced the organized chaos of war, that may come across as a credible representation of reality.  It isn't.  True to life images
of military experience are impossible to recreate artificially, or as artifice.
We know the elemental components in sea water, but the exact formula for making
it in the laboratory escapes us.  The result may taste right to us, but nothing
that actually originated in the sea comes to life in it.  Marine creatures know
the difference, in a sense that we can only imagine.

Leaving little to our imagination, simulated combat in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is testament to Steven Spielberg's.  Fertile as the prairie, it flows effortlessly into everything he does.  Unquestionably, there is no director more earnest and hardworking.  His enthusiasm is positively infectious.

As an actor, I would like to work with him, since his appreciation of the craft appears to match his passion for all aspects of production.  As someone remarks
in the retrospective on making ""Saving Private Ryan"" that accompanies the D-Day edition, Spielberg ""knows what he wants.""  In the broad sense, he has a vision,
and a basic plan.  A formula.  Usually, it works. Sometimes, it doesn't.

More telling, here, he has a positive mania for detail and storytelling, with a result that these elements sometimes combine, abruptly, forming manic images on
the screen.  In one scene on the beach, Captain Miller turns his head to resume
contact with a radio operator, only to find that the man's face has been turned into bloody pulp.  His first thought, however, is to check the radio.  From the many veterans that I have interviewed over the years of researching the landing
at Normandy, even the most grizzled and combat-weary man would recoil from such
a sight, stunned into temporary immobility, faced with yet one more reminder of
his own vulnerability.  The obliterated face is shown so briefly, if you blink,
you'll miss it.

The dizzying succession of images is a distraction.  If Spielberg expects me to
think about what I'm watching, I need time for that.  If his intent is to cause
me to feel as disoriented as the soldiers, I think he's succeeded.  Frankly, it looks like he's tried to accomodate too much material.  Ideas stampede, crowded beach, crowded brain.

To say that the storyline is carried forward too quickly more than once in this film is an understatement.  In the space of mere seconds, Ranger Miller reveals
that he has command, not only of his faculties, but of the landing, shouting an order to inform the Fleet:  ""We don't hold the beach!""

I know that this scene is to show that individual men exercised initiative, but
the compression of time takes the script over the top.

Andy Rooney notes in MY WAR that, for the men on the beach in the initial hours
of D-Day, the boundaries of their world were measured in scant yards to left or right.  They saw little beyond that.  Smoke covered the area.  Remarkable, what Miller and his sergeant managed to see of the enemy, using their small mirrors, servicing successful battle plans.

In standard war films, chief protagonists are usually outfront, doing important things.  A clear hint that we should continue to watch them closely.  While the  theatrics in this film stray from cliche, for the most part, there are hints of
the 1990s.  Movies, even thoughtfully crafted ones, are products of their time,
and this one is no exception.  It's mostly about personal relationships.

I concur with General Colin Powell's perspective on the command decisions taken, leading up to the climactic battle.  The Army has never been a democracy.  In an actual situation, everyone was accountable, and acted accordingly.

I'm not exactly certain why, I guess I simply burned out on the genre (the same can be said concerning mafia/gangster films). Now after finally relenting and giving this WWII war film a viewing all I can say is it's fantastic!  It succeeds on every level, unique and well conceived storyline, sharp, insightful dialogue, impressive production values, outstanding ensemble cast and of course a magnificent soundtrack by the legendary John Williams.

There's definitely an unending string of accolades you could bestow upon this film and all would be undeniably deserved, this is most certainly one of the great war films of all-time. Watching these American soldiers deal with the crisis and chaos that is part and parcel of everyday life on the front-lines is both exhilarating and heart wrenching as the audience slowly comes to realize that acts of bravery and heroism are nothing more than the innate desire of mans will to survive made manifest. Spielberg goes one step further in his analysis of the human condition as he posits the ultimate question to those who where blessed with the gift of life; what did I do to deserve this and what can I do to show myself worthy of a second chance?

2018106,5,B0001NBLVI,"This film has become a classic for combat realism & intensity. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted, especially the first 25-30 minutes.

For many years I considered THE LONGEST DAY, the best film about the Normandy invasion during WWII.  That was an excellent film for its time, but this Spielberg production takes the invasion & ensuing days to a much more intense, gut-wrenching level, with a story that not only is based in fact but also shows the horrors of combat in a way that few films ever have.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN develops the characters in such a way that any harm that befalls them has a greater impact on the audience than most war films.

There are a number of breakout performances by this star-studded cast (Sizemore, Diesel, Pepper, Davies, Goldberg, Ribisi) with some fine ""cameos"" by Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dale Dye, and Dennis Farina, to mention some of the more better known actors.  Tom Hanks EARNED his Oscar for best actor.  His performance as Captain John Miller was BETTER THAN ""spot on""; it was masterful.

2018107,3,B0001NBLVI,"SPOILERS ALERT:
Okay, great action movie. Great performances. Great cinematography. But...the film moralizes that it does not pay to be ""decent"" in war, and that it DOES pay to break the rules of war. Captain Miller and crew capture a Wehrmacht soldier. The Law of Land Warfare and 3rd and 4th Geneva Conventions state it would be a war crime to kill him. Captian Miller lets him go. Reiben derides this as ""the decent"" thing to do. Upham argues that killing the soldier would be ""against the rules."" The Wehrmacht soldier, most likely, kills Captian Miller in the finale stand off at the bridge. So the movie maintains that Upham and Miller were wrong to let the soldier live, that it was wrong to be ""decent"" and follow the rules. Both Upham and Miller are a bit nerdy, well educated, and quasi-intellectual, so the movie also makes the point that educated individuals have no place in war. An F Off to many war protesters. (Upham is a map maker, another sign of his inability to get down and dirty and fight, to hold tightly to his objectivity and to his inability to have what it takes to be a real soldier) (Incidentally, in Brian DePalma's Redacted, the soldiers that don't go along with the rape and murder of the Iraqi citizens are educated. So De Palma seems to disagree with Speilberg and Ryan scriptwriter, Robert Rodat, on this point, though i do know Spielberg and De Palma are great friends).

There's a reason this movie was shown unedited on television when the war with Ahafganistan (sp?) started (a necessary war): to disseminate its ethics out to the US populace. It paves the way to Guantanamo and Abu Grahib, and other situations where the US disregarded the Geneva Conventions. Well, there are Japanese soldiers today still unrepentent for the way they mistreated US POW's during the war. On a history channel documentary, one explains to the interviewer, as to why Japan did this, that ""This is war."" Now I am NOT saying the US infractions are nearly as bad as that of WWII Japan's. Japan's were 10,000 times worse. But this is the reductio as absurdum that the ideology of Ryan lead to. That said, i've watched the climax about 1000 times, and it  ranks as my 2nd favorite war film (Platoon's my favorite).",1246838400,2,2230,4.67175572519084

2018111,5,B0001NBLVI,"My headline offers a subjective question, but I think most people would at least agree this is one of the best war movies they've seen, especially if they have a pretty decent 5.1 surround sound system. You can't fully appreciate this DVD and movie, in generally, without the great surround this disc offers.

Sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The visuals are outstanding, too, and we'll see a Blu-Ray version of this film soon, making it even better.

Since the film has been out for over 10 years, there is no sense going into the story. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is today.

It makes you appreciate what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.

Anyway, bad language and/or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, maybe the most dramatic in the history  of film.

2018112,2,B0001NBLVI,"Lately, when Hollywood produces war movies, they focus on the debacle of
Vietnam.  Not director Steven Spielberg!  Instead, the incredibly versatile helmer of ""Jaws,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Color Purple,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" impales a patriotic chapter of American history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy ""Saving Private Ryan.""  ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as a second-rate World War II movie with a first-class cast and top-notch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed.  As demeaning as this criticism sounds, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the top 25 World War II movies.  Unfortunately, the film contains so many glaring historical inaccuracies as well as wholly improbable plot contrivances that you wonder what Spielberg was thinking when he made it. Since ""Saving Private Ryan"" swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" and Sylvester Stallone's ""Rambo"" have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence.

If the story had been as memorable as the kinetic, blood-splattered battle scenes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" might have been a classic.  Essentially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a ten-star movie until the U.S. Army gets off the beach and into France where it devolves into just another standard-issue G.I. Joe war epic.  Anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captain's bars painted on the front like a bull's eye.  This is an egregious error!  During World War II, officers didn't advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head.  Okay, I'd dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except the filmmakers raise the same point.  A seasoned dogface (Vin Diesel) warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain down.

Dispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of Hallmark speeches about valor, loyalty, and redemption.  These platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical rat-a-tat-tat.  Spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie.  Running nearly three hours in length, this rowdy, often profane World War II melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab, sometimes improbable tale.  Consider the scene in the town when the wall collapses between the Germans and the GIs and they stand with their arms brandished screaming at each like a Mexican stand-off.  Come on, give me a break, in real life, either side would have opened up on each other.  Similarly, letting Steamboat Willie go is another incredible lapse of believability.

Told from the perspective of the infantry, ""Saving Private Ryan"" shares in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" Samuel Fuller's ""The Big Red One,"" Lewis Milestone's ""A Walk in the Sun,"" and William Wellman's ""Background.""  Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that ""Saving Private Ryan"" commands, but they are solidly-made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories.  The muddled but high-minded screenplay by ""Fly Away House"" scenarist Robert Rodat follows a unit of U.S. Rangers on a dim-witted public relations mission to rescue an American paratrooper.

Captain Miller (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") assembles a collection of stock characters to help him locate 101ST Airborne Paratrooper Private James Ryan of Iowa.  Ryan (Matt Damon of ""Good Will Hunting"") has gotten lost behind enemy lines in the pre-dawn parachute drops that preceded the June 6th D-Day Normandy Invasion.  When the War Department discovers that Ryan's two brothers bite the sand at Normandy and that the Japanese have killed a third sibling a week earlier, General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell of ""Fargo"") decides to pull the last Ryan out of action.  Along the way, Miller's G.I.s complain about the irony of risking eight lives to save one guy.

Before ""Saving Private Ryan"" grinds to its sanguinary conclusion, the Biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious.  Spielberg and Rodat, along with uncredited scribes Scott Frank and Frank ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Darabont, seem confused.  Are they making a fiercely repellent anti-war movie?  Or have the drummed up a gung-ho Hong Kong style, kick-butt actioneer?  They
pile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies.  Bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence.  Presumably, the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flag-waving John Wayne propaganda sagas.  The sadistic horrors that occur in ""Saving Private Ryan"" seems more commercially than philosophically oriented.  We don't think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survive.

The first 24 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" dwells on the famous D-Day landing at Omaha Beach.  Spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick G.I.s as they waded ashore into a murderous Third Reich shooting gallery.  This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics.
After the scary, visceral D-Day prologue, the film settles down long enough for Miller to receive new orders.  Eventually, Miller locates Ryan with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind Nazi lines.  Ryan refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch.  Reluctantly, Miller and his squad prepare for the worst.  This part of ""Saving Private Ryan"" has a lot of action, but it cannot compete with the 1960s ABC-TV show
""Combat.""  Tom Sizemore makes a credible sergeant, but the usually dependable Edward Burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders.  Tom Hanks' former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise.  Many soldiers have commented--among them retired Joints Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell--that Miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated.  Of course, had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battle.

Spielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities.  The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera.  The only thing that saves Spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the G.I.s shoot the surrendering Nazi troops.  ""Saving Private Ryan,"" for all its obvious flaws, still qualifies a movie any die-hard World War II fanatic should watch at least three times.",1235347200,10,6769,5.222222222222222

Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action a private by the name of Ryan. His mother recently received all 3 telegrams with a chaplin and an officer arriving at her doorstep on a remote farm. Miller's men set out to find Private Ryan against all odds which features a certain style about the film that doesn't make out a typical hollywood film. This film also boasts alot of big stars including, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi and many other familiar faces.

The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winning Schindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose. Saving Private Ryan touches us deeper than Schindler because it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make. An unforgettable experience that won't be forgotten.",1228608000,2,2049,4.988304093567251
2018114,3,B0001NBLVI,"This is an interesting film but marred in all sorts of funny ways: yukky setimentality intrudes and damages what could have been a very great film.

The opening sequence is based on a similar one in a German film called Stalingrad, and has great impact. When the film came out, this is what impressed people, along with its apparent realism.

Wouldn't it have been a great film if Private Ryan himself had not been much worth saving? He is presented as an heroic figure when we first see him, holding a bazooka. But supposing he had been crying and hiding behind a tree? That would have, perhaps, have said more about the nature of war, fate and taking orders.

When hundreds of dead American troops are shown lying dead in the surf, there is a musical soundtrack, an orchestra in a minor key. Why? Surely, the sight of hundreds of young men lying dead on a beach is melancholy enough.

Why was it set in the present, with the body of the film as a flashback? I could not see the purpose to trying to anchor it in the present, in some way.

No disrespect to anyone, but why is it that whenever we see a US flag, or hear the mention of someone like President Lincoln, an orchestra always starts to play? It has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.",1223510400,3,1245,4.372294372294372

2018121,4,B0001NBLVI,"For some reason this film annoys me.  The film has a great cast and it has some spectacular parts which are really intense.  For example, the opening invasion was great.  I heard one vet remark.  ""The only thing missing was the smell.""  The knife fight between Mellish and the SS soldier was intense and even bothered some people.  I even liked the interaction between the soldiers during lulls.

For me this could have been a better story if it was kept simple with the harsh realities of war.  However, what started to annoy me was the layers of schmaltz that were added in.  The premise sounds neat but I really doubt a veteran ranger unit would be sent to find one guy in the middle of a war zone.  It's a waste of highly trained men.

Corpral Upham to me was an infuriating character.  I suspect that it's Spielberg injecting himself into the story as some story tellers sometimes do.  I am finding people either love him or hate him.  He annoyed me to no end and never mind the fact he got a few men killed.  Mellish, the paratrooper that was with him, and Captain Miller.

Steamboat Willie.  This character became a blunder due to casting.  Many people think that he and the man who stabbed Mellish are the same.  They are not.  One is SS and Willie I think is Luftwaffe.  It gave the impression the Upham shot him for killing Mellish.

Private Ryan.  Now I wish they left Matt Damon off the credits.  The fact I suspected he was Ryan took away from a great scene where the find a Private Ryan, tell him his brothers are dead, and learn it's not him.  It was really sad to hear him cry.  The shock factor was lost since I knew it was not him.

One thing I noticed was wrong was the P-51 ""tank busters""  They really didn't do that often.  That was usually the job of the P-47 Thunderbolts.  The P-51 was an areal fighter and was not armored for that kind of duty.  I read somewhere somebody looked up the unit from the insignia of the planes and said they didn't have P-51s at that time.  They were still flying the P-47s.

The second DVD is a ""watch it once"" thing.  It's interesting to see how they made the film but it's not something you will return to often.  I thought they could have done more with information about the battle itself.

Overall, it's a good film.  But as I said it annoys me due to the premise and the schmaltz factor.",1194998400,3,2348,4.302752293577981
2018122,4,B0001NBLVI,"What sets ""Saving Private Ryan"" apart from many other war films is its stunning portrayal of combat. The confusion, brutality, and noise of war are brilliantly realised by the director and cinematographer.

It's not perfect, however. The central premise is a bit too cute and the framing device of a veteran visiting a war cemetary is overly sentimental, especially right at the very end.

Spielberg's commentary on WWII is not the ""masterpiece"" that many purport it to be, but it is still a fine film.",1193443200,5,502,4.894117647058824
2018123,3,B0001NBLVI,"Though I liked this movie overall, though there are some outstanding shots, sequences, and effects, and though I would probably recommend it to friends and acquaintances as one of the better cinema treatments about World War II, my expectations were too disappointed to engage in high praise of this work. I had many serious ""problems"" with SPR from the very opening overtly false patriotic flag scene to the very end.

The opening scene of Ryan as an old man visiting the Normandy cemetery was fine except for one very annoying factor, John Williams, lush, overly-sentimental BS musical pretensions, which we've heard 100 times already, and in almost every scene in which this score swelled, I felt it was inappropriate. I would've much rather have heard no music whatsoever throughout the film, or at least a very subtle form of and use of.  I don't really like being manipulated like this. And various scenes do this.  A lush musical war, no thanks.

The most striking example of the film's almost soulless failure to do justice to its apparent agenda and real blood and guts reality (to show how utterly abominable real war is), brings me to yet another complaint. The films' cinema verite, shaky documentary camera style. NYPD Blue on amphetamines...

A little of this ""style"" can go a long way. Drenching entire scenes lasting several minutes, was totally ineffective and pretentious to me.  Some of the wobbly camera in the opening sequence, was very potent, like the troops running towards the beach. This gave the viewer a real sense of being there, of being in a frantic state of confusion, attempting to move forward into a frightening and imposing blur of horror and motion. However, a bit later, when Hanks and his men are using a mirror at the end of a rifle to try to find out where a particular German machine gun is firing from, why shake the camera? When the medics are trying to fix up wounded men on the beach, why shake the camera? If one were there watching these things, they would simply not be seeing it from this perspective. Again, this whole technique was so overused to me.

What's so disappointing about SPR is that it just could've been done so much better, in so many areas.  Long, boring, unimaginative sequences are followed by Hollywood hokum.  The truly outstanding radar attack sequence, stood out.  The characters were given a REAL identity to me during this portion. But for all the talk (hype?) of blood and gore and entrails in SPR's beginning, to me, the only really powerful depictions of real war in the film, was specifically in the segment when one of the GI's chests was pumping gushes of bright red blood, in addition to some opening shots.

Why wasn't there so much more of this however?  Why not show utterly horrible pain and suffering and death?  That which is real war?  That which is happening even as I write this, which I hope Spielberg or one of his other cronies may deal with in the near future, about Iraq.  Holding my breath, but not too long.

The entire Axis prisoner scene, was good. There was a real tension here, and I easily felt myself not watching a movie anymore, but feeling as if I had some sort of personal stake in what I was watching. In SPR, Spielberg's more delicate and subtly discriminating add-ons, were clearly the best moments of the film. All the blood and violence and special effects of the opening and closing sections (the closing sections having nearly as much power as the opening ones), never came close for me, in displaying the real horror of war, than this one little middle section, which culminated in two men on the same side, almost killing each other because a ""bad guy"" POW was being released.

There were and are WAY TOO MANY shots for me of Americans mowing down whole groups of German soldiers, like as if this was a standard scene out of WWII (it wasn't). It IS a standard, stereotypical scene out of WWII MOVIES however. I had hoped for much more however, in SPR. Otherwise, in Spielberg's fantasy WWII world, whole German squads can easily be mowed down by a single GI, and tanks and other weapons can be disabled with nothing more than some good old GI Joe bravery. For all the effects, for all the blood and guts that ARE shown, SPR continually refuses to step over certain lines. It wants to be two things at once, which is its ultimate undoing, to show the ""reality"" of war, but to do it in an entertaining Hollywood story suited for mass consumption.

I have to say this film, like digestible war-movie filler candy before and after, satisfies for awhile, but there are no great ideas here, no true moral or political or philosophical ""center"" or soul. And there is nothing groundbreaking here except for a few FX enhanced ""war scenes.""  There are much better WWI&II films, of all stripes.  I'd suggest ""Enemy at the Gates,"" or ""Paths of Glory,' or even the low budget ""A Midnight Clear.""  For starters.

This is a fairly good war film, but not a ""great"" war film. DVD extras aside.  What the film clearly does wrong, cannot in the final analysis, overcome the few things it does really great and right. Entertaining? Yes. Transcendent?  But only if one is easily prone to hype, political, or cinematic, or falsely (IMO) ""patriotic"" propaganda.  This viewer is none of the above, and in the end, to me is just another Steven Spielberg misfire, which garnered and continues to receive critical/popular praise truly undeserved, compared to so many other much more worthy WWII films.  As well as documentaries.  I wish the whole script had been rewritten/filmed, concentrating on D-Day alone, and never diverted into a corny, schmaltzy retread of almost any other good or bad WWII flick since, or afterwards.",1188950400,5,5715,4.723340040241449

2018125,5,B0001NBLVI,"From the opening scenes to coming full circle in the closing scenes, Saving Private Ryan is a movie and emotionally draining film that leaves you analyzing your own life to determine if you have led a life worth the sacrifices the men and women of our armed forces have made.

Speilberg has created another masterpiece.  Just when I thought he could not create a movie more vital than Schindler's List, he comes up with Saving Private Ryan.  I cannot say enough about this film.  If bloody realism is not something you can stomach then move past the initial Normandy invasion scenes.  If you can stomach it though, I encourage watching the scenes because they set the tone for the characters.

2018126,5,B0001NBLVI,"I had to watch Saving Private Ryan a second time -years later- to fully understand the importance of World War II, and specifically, what the soldiers had to go through.  The first 30 minutes of film were truly something unbelievable.  The emotions I felt watching the soldiers landing on shore and being surrounded by enemies who didn't hesitate to attack was overwhelming.  I seriously wanted to cry.  It really touched me on a personal level that I've never felt in a war movie before.  It made me realize what was going on.  40 years before I was born *this* kind of extreme violence was happening on Earth.  It was enough to make me sick.  Human beings killing each other left and right.  I've never seen a war movie really show the extreme nature of war quite like this film.

I'm totally serious- the movie begins on a really intense level, and continues for the next 30 minutes without letting up on all sorts of gun shootings, explosions, bodies falling apart and drifting away, hopeless feelings lingering in the air.  I can't imagine what it must be like to serve in war, and honestly, this movie really opened my eyes and showed me how important it is to support our troops and what they must be going through on a daily basis.  The film may be only 2 and a half hours long, but the war lingered on for years, and I can only imagine it eventually reached a point when people were beginning to wonder ""Is this war ever going to end?""

Saving Private Ryan will surprise and shock you on many occasions.  Sometimes the film seems so real it's almost like you're there with the soldiers.  I recommend buying the movie.",1184630400,2,1626,4.52054794520548

But the film's true achievement, apart from its Oscar-winning editing and visual effects, is its charged storyline and debate over the merits of bloodshed.

2018128,5,B0001NBLVI,"Saving Private Ryan hit me so hard that I could not move for ten minutes after the credits rolled. James Francis Ryan had a wake up call that no 19 year old should have. At his age he should still have had time to be the know-all smart Alec kid that was his prerogative. Instead he stood on a bridge in France with Capt. John Miller telling him, ""James, earn this...earn it,"" with his dying breathe. Be worthy of my death and the deaths of my men to save your life; words that were to haunt and change the rest of his life.
And I liked the way Spielberg didn't let us off the hook with the Normandy landing, there were no quick cuts and compressed action shots. We had to ride all the way into beach with Miller and his men. I found the everyday ""normality"" of the sound of the landing craft engine almost maddening as I watched so many the men ride to death. I had a bizarre reaction to the long opening scene on the beach as the men finally took out the machine guns; I knew intellectually that I was watching a movie, but in the pit of my stomach I had a queasy feeling that I was watching CNN live and I just had to sit and watch helplessly.
 Spielberg uses his effective form of putting ordinary men into extra-ordinary situations with this film too. Captain Miller, a high school English teacher from Pennsylvania is given a tough assignment in the Rangers, who are given the tough assignments in the army.
 I found the only flaw in the dialogue was when Ryan asks, ""Why me, why should I be saved?"" Miller starts on some talk about that was too dull for me. The point was that it had nothing to do with James...it was all about Sean, Peter and Daniel; his three dead brothers and the nation's refusal to ask more of one family than it humanely should - that is it would not obliterate a family by wiping out its bloodline.

2018133,5,B0001NBLVI,"When this movie came out in theatres, my ex's grandfather went to see this movie. He was in the army in Europe during WWII. This movie was a moving and heartfelt experience, but speaking with him afterwards even moreso. It opened a lot of discussion about what it was ""Really like"".

He told us which position was most like his, etc and all of that. One thing that sticks with me is how he said the most ""real"" part of the movie was when they were sitting around talking about home. Talking about girls, family, their ""old life"". He said it depicted the variety of people well, but how they all came together somehow and all had so much in common deep down. Tom Hanks and Spielberg went on to make Band of Brothers, a mini-series based on the book of the same name. I'd recommend that as well. It WAS based off real events and you get commentary from the people the movie is based off of. It's priceless. For those who were looking for more of a documentary, it would be perfect for you.

""Saving Private Ryan"" is less about the specific battles and events and more about the overall effect of the war on people. I know our war veteran spoke of those who died as the true heroes, not him. He never understood how he deserved to live when so many other wonderful men died. This movie depicted that perfectly, in my opinion. It can be difficult and heartwrenching at times to watch, but I think any movie that can have that effect on you is a movie worth seeing.",1166054400,4,1460,4.324817518248175
2018134,2,B0001NBLVI,"I never really liked this film when it was released.  Years later, I realised that it was just a film that garnered all the hype in the world to disguise the fact that it's really a shallow movie.  Essentially, the movie has 2 incredibly violent, gory battles scenes, and the stuff in between is absolute garbage.  The main characters in this film seem liked they were pulled from every WWII movie that Robert Rodat (the screenwriter) and Steven Spielberg saw when they were a child.  You never get a sense that these people are real people, just characters in a Hollywood version of WWII.  The actors scream and shout like they're in a video game, not a war.  The sniper character is especially creepy, saying God shines through his rifle and a lot of other garbage that wouldn't be too out of place in The Crusades.  Are we supposed to like him?  We don't.  I just recently saw Flags of Our Fathers, which centered on the famous picture of Iwo Jima.  It too had realistic, gory battle scenes, but they fit into the film as a whole.  That film had depth and had a message about war, the human condition, and propaganda.  This film has no real soul to it.  The battle scenes just seem to like to show how gory war is (which it is, obviously), but that's the only point.  There is nothing else in the film that matters.  The whole thing is hollow to the core.  Having also seen Darryl F. Zanuck's production The Longest Day, this film fails in comparison.  Zanuck had served in WWII, and his film is vastly superior.  The Longest Day covered the Normandy invasion in brilliant fashion, covering it with the most meticulous detail.  It also made a point that there were British, Scottish, and Irish troops on the shores of Normandy too (something Private Ryan forgot to mention), and that the French Resistance played a huge role in disrupting German communications before the invasion (another oversight).  The graphic violence doesn't even give one a sense of war.  It seems they land on the beach, a lot of people get killed in gruesome ways, then they're on top of the beach making jokes about the whole thing.  Flags of Our Fathers and The Longest Day really give you a sense of what the planning was, and why they were there.  This film doesn't.  There's actually some very awkward comic relief in the film, too.  Spielberg has made a great WWII film, but it isn't this one.  It's Empire of the Sun, based on JG Ballard's book.  That film is one of Spielberg's greatest, and most underrated, films.  See that one, The Longest Day, or Malick's The Thin Red Line.

The special effects for this movie are sadly incredible. I say sadly because of how realistically these soldiers die.

2018137,1,B0001NBLVI,"Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there. Bad film is often just as revealing: its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience. Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter, in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow, the American people stand revealed for what they really are: stupid, self-absorbed, morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear.

""Saving Private Ryan"" is typical Steven Spielberg fare: a big budget spectacle, bereft of style, filled to the brim with childishly heavy-handed moralizing and peopled with facile ""characters"" who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby - America GOOOOOD, Nazis BAAAAD.

The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D-Day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham-fisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg, there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered (hint: with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone - because, obviously, the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List).

The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism, but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory, full of irritating, disorienting jump cuts, pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail, camera tricks and special effects artifices, all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.

Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately, Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum (complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary), Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall (Harve Presnell) decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.

At this point, Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motley-crew-of-experts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled: the tough-as-nails seargent; the feisty Italian; the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God (if the historical setting had been Vietnam, I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro); the REMF wuss - all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks, Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die (does anyone really remember which ones?). The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man - having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF - returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end, Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!

The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly, it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction, it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains, cowards and the courageous, us and them. In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda.

2018141,4,B0001NBLVI,"Let me start of with this, This movie is proibably my favorite and among the best war films ever made. I decided to write a review because many people were saying ""this is not factual"" and things of that nature so I just had to rebut. I'll get to that later though.

Anyway, the movie itself is great but in my opinion the bonus disc is pretty weak. It is interesting to see how the movie was made but I think they should have also thrown in a d-day documentary or two and things of that nature. It is, after all the 60th anniversay commemorative. In my opinion, there should be some d-day material there.

And now on to the long part, the bone I have to pick with other reviewers. If you are satisfied by what you have read you can stop now.

First, many people say the plot is cliched and unoriginal. Okay, many of the messages are cliched, i agree. However, all war movies have the same basic idea that this does. SPR does go into deeper issues, though. Throughout the movie we see the soldiers questioning their orders and acting more human than the ""yes, sir"" ""no, sir"" patriots we see in other films. We see something that is representative of the war in general. It covers D-Day and many of the events in the movie are representative of the Normandy campaign in general. Overall, I think this movie shows the soldiers in a different light than many movies do; it especially shows that they are citizen soldiers, regular men who are fighting a war. Now I also went through many reviews and found what people say is historically inaccurate and found that they really have no idea what they are saying. I quoted these reviews and made my own rebuttals.

A common thing I saw was that people think the idea of sending a squad to save one man wouldn't have happened and they are right. However, the point  beyond that is that the movie is representative of the war and the soldiers, it doesn't necessarily show an event. I will say that if you want complete historical accuracy see Band of Brothers, it is made in much the same way but it is entirely nonfiction.

""The battle on the beach lasted 9 hours, not 20 minutes. You don't quite get a feeling for that one.""- This is true, however, individual units were assigned individual objectives. This means that it is entirely plausible that Miller's company fulfilled their individual objective and, after all, this company is the focus of the film.

""While watching the stupid Krauts being mowed down by the dozen you keep asking yourself how they managed to conquer all of Europe in the first place.""- By this time in the war the German army was severely depleted and had to resort to many reserves and conscripts. Not only that, but the soldiers that were left were battle-weary so while that may not be an excuse, it could account for some things.

"" As a Captain, Tom Hanks' character would be a company commander, responsible for at least two platoons and far too busy to be assigned to such a capricious task with only five other men.""- While the premise of a small unit flatheading through German lines to find a man is pretty farfetched, captains would be assigned to special duties that might entail commanding a 6-man squad on a special mission. Plus, near the beginning of the film, Miller is in command of a company.

""Regarding the German prisoner they released that many claim to have returned at the end. The solider released after the combat at the radar site was regular army - Deutsche Wehrmacht. Those solders fighting in the town at the end are SS. While lay people may not know the difference, there is a major difference. Some say he was ""pressed into service"" by the SS. Even if that were so, they certainly wouldn't have issued him a new uniform in the day or two that elapsed between his release and the town battle. One does not have the luxury of getting a fresh change of clothes in the middle of an ongoing battle. These were two different men.""- Yes they were two different men, comparing the pictures of the German soldier who is freed and the man who stabs Mellish (which is what I'm assuming this is referring to), they are different. Plus, when the freed soldier recognizes Upham at the end he is wearing a Wehrmacht uniform, not an SS uniform.

""The biggest flaw here is that they try to take the beach without any air or sea cover. Any one who is well versed in war would tell you that if you try to take a beach without cover, you will suffer heavy casualities. No army would commit such a tactical error.""+ There was a preliminary air and sea bombardment of the beaches. Unfortunately, especially at Omaha, most of the bombardment went off-target and didn't do as much damage on the German positions as on other beaches. It is completely realistic that there is no air and sea cover during the battle, and the Americans overran the beach without it.

""am tired of this one sided movies that portray the glories. The Germans lost a lot due to their own follies and things like the offensive against Russia, Barbarossa, cost them heavily due to the bitter cold. No one mentions this in the movies. Even when the German High Command asked Hitler to retreat, he would refuse to do so. That was his mistake. He had an uncanny way of sizing up his enemies and only in the end he overreached himself. I am glad that he lost, but it is due to a combination of circumstances. There were more Indians in British army who lost lives than Canadians or Australians. This is never mentioned in any movie. India lost close to 100000 people in WWII, but thanks to their color, they are not considered important. They served in British armies all over North Africa and Europe. They fought some of the fiercest battlest against Rommel.""- This is all true but how it relates to the storyline in this film is beyond me.

""Unfortunately the WW II story of the average soldier is lost in the quote We gotta save a kid! end quote heart-warmer.""- I beg to differ. The movie portrays Miller as less of an officer and more of a peer to the men which was often the case. Also, it shows the soldiers questioning their orders and talking and joking with each other. It shows soldiers in the war on a very personal level.

""Given the mission is find Pvt. Ryan why attack the machine gun nest? How did Tom Hanks know only 3-4 Germans were there and not 30? Why didn't TH just send his sniper to pick them off instead of doing a frontal assualt? Why was the medic charging the MG when he could have stayed behind?""- I do agree with this, that is a pretty baffling thing. This scene is definitely Hollywood.

""Tom Hanks walks around with stripes on his helmet (so snipers can easily tip him off- makes sense)...""- Most officers didn't put the stripes on their helmets for the reason of snipers and, if they did, they would put them on in black so they were more subdued. Keep in mind, though, that this is MOST officers, helmet markings were not uncommon.

""The casualty rate for the period (by far the worst that day at Omaha) was approx 11 1/2 percent, far fewer than one one asume from watching Pvt Ryan.""- Yes, the worst casualties were at Omaha and, surprise! The opening scene takes place on Omaha. 11  percent is for the entire allied force. The casualties on the other beaches were much more minimal.

""the Krauts are abandoning their bunker and, suddenly there is a Czech speech, which I recognized instantly and startlingly..., the supposedly Czech-speaking Wehrmacht soldier screams out, in Czech language : ""I did not kill anybody, don't shoot me."" The impact on me was immediate - the use of a language other than German (incomprehensible to US viewers, of course) is still the cheap Spielberg device to unnecesarilly magnify (and falsify) the Nazi brotherhood of nations going against ""us"".""- Yes the soldier is, in fact, Czech. Many people from across occupied Europe (including Czechoslovakia) either joined the German army or were conscripted into service. Further, it cannot be said that these soldiers are Nazis. The Wehrmacht was the army of Germany and most of the soldiers were fighting for their country; most of them were not Nazis.

Now, like any movie, the film does have historical inaccuracies but I really don't think I'll go into them now.

Thank you for tolerating my long review and letting me get that off my chest. To sum up this is a splendid movie but the bonus material is pretty average, that is the only thing I don't like. The movie itself is easily 5 stars.",1158019200,6,8455,4.547008547008547

2018146,5,B0001NBLVI,"It is the 4th of July as I write this review.  Driving home, alongside the interstate was a firetruck crane erected to hold a giant US flag some 250 feet in the air.  On this day we celebrate independence, I remember Saving Private Ryan.

Arguing which is Speilberg's ""best film"" is probably a futile exercise.  Fortunately, sometimes in life you don't have to choose a ""best one"".  There are several of his films that are equally perfect in their different pursuits.

On this 7th month and 4th day, I recall 7 ideas from the movie and 4 charges:

1)  There were men of honor, duty and mercy on both sides of the war - One of the most memorable scenes is the German showing mercy to the US soldier in shock as he descends the stairs.

2)  The acts of war create injuries, both physical and mental, that cannot be healed.

3)  Better persons than us died random and unwarranted deaths so that we might enjoy so many freedoms.

4)  The violence and injuries of war are far more gruesome than most people choose to concede.

5)  The gods of war laugh at the concepts of fairness.

6)  There is no solace or remedy for the loss of a child (or children).

7)  Men of few words often show their character through their actions.  But they are not silent, and in times of need, they lead by saying well chosen words.

4 charges:

1)  When viewing war, don't just look at the tactics and movements of armies.  Explore the individual human dramas.

2)  Each person must search to find ways to be decent in indecent and insane circumstances.

3)  You don't do anything by yourself.  No one succeeds on their own.  Any success you achieve is on the shoulders of soldiers who fought so that you would have the ability to succeed.  ""Angels on our shoulders.""

4)  ""EARN this . . .earn it,"" Captain Miller said with a bullet in his chest. What are you doing every day to make the deaths of these soldiers worthwhile?  Did they die so that you would be working at what you are working at today?  What more can you do to make the most of the opportunities they sacrificed for you to have?",1151971200,7,2071,4.3578947368421055

2018149,5,B0001NBLVI,"Saving Private Ryan

Saving Private Ryan is an epic World War II film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is truly one of the most moving and realistic modern day portrayals of World War II. Even though this is a movie, it holds very true to actual events, being based on the lives of eight U.S. soldiers attempting to find Private Ryan and tell him that his continued service in the U.S. army is excused due to the fact that all three of his brothers had died in combat.

The opening scene is filmed during the World War II Memorial Day in France. Private Ryan is portrayed as an old man standing at the sea of graves where men from World War II were buried. From this tranquil point, there is a dramatic transition into the most moving and graphic war-time scene ever filmed.

""Saving Private Ryan"" is best known for its enactment of one of the bloodiest war-time scenes ever witnessed. This scene is the landing of the Americans in Normandy and the invasion of France, otherwise known as D Day. It shows the American soldiers being hacked to pieces by German machine guns. Even though the Americans sustained heavy causalities, they still managed to take the beach head. The enormity of this accomplishment is clearly emphasized for viewers throughout this tensely visual scene.

The movie has more than one scene that is truly engraved in one's mind. For instance, the part where the mother of Private Ryan is told that all three of her sons were killed is equally memorable. As the mother falls to the ground in despair, words are not used, nor needed. It is truly amazing that Spielberg was able to convey his message to the audience, without actually using dialogue, which makes the movie all the more powerful.

To take the movie out into a larger context, one sees the truly vicious nature of war that Steven Spielberg was trying to portray. Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories; tales of heroic glory, such as ""Bridge over the River Quay"" and ""Battle of the Bulge"", and biopics such as ""Patten."" It seems that ""Saving Private Ryan"" falls into neither of these categories. It is a story of human courage and sacrifice. This is what the movie glorifies, rather than war itself. Even though the movie is based on a true story, some of the characters in the movie are fictional. Yet, it is very hard to accept any of these characters as not real.

This film truly leaves a lasting impression on viewers. What one leaves the movie with is highly subjective. For myself, I left the movie in awe. Nothing I have seen has come close to it. More importantly, the film accurately portrayed what war is really like, without trying to glorify it, which in turn made it ever more powerful. One cannot help but have an enormous amount of respect for those who so bravely gave their lives in this war. Clearly, to volunteer your life for your country is the ultimate sacrifice and a pure act of bravery, but to volunteer your life to save another is an act of selfless caring for another human being and without a doubt that is the ultimate sacrifice.",1149033600,3,3063,4.58029197080292

2018151,5,B0001NBLVI,"I first saw SPR back in April of this year in my 11th grade History class, and it stunned me.  Even now I still get chills thinking of some of the scenes.  The opening landing on Omaha Beach and the scene where Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg) gets stabbed were enough to give me nightmares for weeks afterwards.

Even so, I wanted to see it again, not for the blood and gore, but for the characters.  Wade was the one that I identified with the most; the kindly medic would do anything to save a soldier, even when he was already gone. The two parts that really have stuck with me are the scenes where Medic Wade and Private Mellish die, mainly because those are my favorite characters (yay for Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg!!).

Wade's scene had me in tears; it was so touching how they were trying to save him. Even as he was going into shock and hallucinating, they kept up a steady flow of chatter to distract him as they put pressure on the wounds; it made me cry even more as I heard what Jackson was whispering to him as Wade was fading out of consciousness: ""shhhhhh, you'll be alright, Wade... shhhhhh..."".  It was beautifully tragic how Jackson comforted him in his last moments, whispering to him and rubbing his forehead.

And the other scene (Mellish's death) was an absolute knockout.  He's fighting this German SS soldier guy, and he gets overpowered and pinned to the floor.  As the soldier starts to kill him, Mellish pleads for his life, and do you know what that soldier does next? HE SOOTHES HIM AS HE STABS HIM TO DEATH! ""Give in . . . you have no other choice ... make it easier for both of us...the war is over for you. Shhh. Rest now...shhhhhh...""  That one scene made me so sad and angry at Upham for being a coward and not helping Mellish that I wanted to break something.

Everyone in my class thought Corporal Upham was a cowardly [...] who should have been shot when they got a chance, and I agreed with them.  But I could also identify with him.  He was relatively new to combat and inexperienced, scared of what he had to do.  If I were him I'd be scared too.

This movie has shown me what war is really like; it's hell on Earth.  The glossed over Hollywood fluff of war movies of the past is dead to me.  I've always been a very empathetic person, and I was warned before watching this that it would be very VERY gory, and if I needed to, I could step out and get a drink of water.  I didn't leave.  I watched through clasped hands, biting my lip to keep from crying; I didn't close my eyes to the horror.
I would have to say that EVERY high school student in the United States should see this movie; if not all of it, they should at least watch the opening beach landing scene.  Teens these days are so desensitized to violence that they don't know what real violence is.  This movie will change their minds.  I know it changed mine.",1147996800,4,2870,4.315298507462686

The first part was the bloody fighting at the D-Day landing.  The fighting around the bridge had two horrific parts:  the soldier who was killed with the sticky bomb and the soldiers killed by the 20mm German auto-cannon.

I had never seen a director catch the feel of small unit actions before Saving Private Ryan (SPR).  Prior to that you never really felt a movie from a pure soldiers point of view.  The special effects at Omaha beach only lack sand being thrown in your face, salt water, and some unlucky soul next to you screaming with a gun shot wound.  That was worth four stars.

I highly encourage people to watch this movie.  They will know the trials the greatest generation had to endure to keep Hitler from ruling the world.

Conversely, there is a modern ""town hall"" meeting where the men were moving in a combat formation and talking.  Most soldiers of that period never would have openly told their commanding captain they didn't support a mission.  In real life two things would happen.  The unit would quickly found another soldier to support the mission and the offender would have been in a stockade.  The Army didn't screw around back in those days.

The 60th Anniversary Edition is presented in a very sturdy ""bullet"" case.  Opening up gives you two discs with a very good background design with scraps and memorabilia of the Operation Overlord (The Normandy invasion).  The 2nd disc is primarily the extras...a chance to see all the research and diligent work put into making the film as authentic as possible.  The storyline, finding the 4th Ryan brother, is very similar to an actual (read: real) problem the military had back then.  From then on, the US military had prohibited relatives from serving in the same unit, or being assigned to the same hostile area.

The idea of sending one unit to find Pvt Ryan (a member of the infamous 101st ""missed drop"" unit), can and, in the inspiration for the movie, did happen.

Because of this movie...Gamers have ""Medal of Honor"", ""Call of Duty"", and ""Brothers in Arms"", and HBO and History Channel has/had ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Mail Call"".

World War II may seem like way too long ago for anyone to really watch this movie and wonder ""Why does it matter?"".

2018172,4,B0001NBLVI,"I had the benefit of doing a staff ride (field trip) to Normandy during my service in the Big Red One.  Walking through the cemetary and battlefields really brought a sense of reality to what I saw in this movie.  It is strange how places develop souls of their own.

We had a history expert as our tour guide and he basically did what he called the Saving Private Ryan tour.  We went to a lot of different places that were shown in this movie as well as some others.  The tour was truly invaluable.

The opening scenes of the landing at Normandy are agreed on by most reliable experts to be realistic and the best ever put to film.  After that the movie is pretty much fictional and not historically accurate although the feel is still real.

The reason why I am docking 1 star is because of the scene with the crashed glider.  The General that went down with this glider was a man of honor and truly a soldier's General.  There is absolutely no reason to believe there was any special effort to protect his glider with armor plating.  This is Hollywood garbage and was unnecessary.  I put a stone on his grave as did many others to show my appreciation.  He died in action like everyone else and deserves to be remembered only with honor and appreciation.

For a more realistic look at WWII watch Band of Brothers. These people were truly America's greatest generation and the entire world owes them so much.  When France did not want to help us out President Bush should have sent Chirac a copy of this and B.O.B. and said next time maybe we will be too busy, order more white flags.",1122508800,3,1586,4.383561643835616

After watching this movie, it always stayed with me, and I realized how lucky I am that I wasn't in that war, and how lucky I am that my grandfather didn't die in that war. I visited Normandy months after watching it, and the tour guide informed us that we were at the location where D-Day occured. We saw the many graves, and it was then that I saw what happened in this movie occur before my eyes once again. This movie is a masterpiece, and it shall always be remembered.

Parts of this movie are just spectacular, from the super realism of the opening segments, landing on the Omaha beach, to some really precious intimate scenes during lulls in battle between the soldiers. Superb ensemble acting.  I suspect the script writers got all that dead on right. But Spielberg is never satisfied to just give us a simple story well told etched in harsh reality. He has to add his layers of schmaltz and syrup, like that's the only way we can consume this stuff. It really drives me nuts. So we end up with this manipulative schmaltz throughout the movie, beginning with the John Willams score (will someone please shoot him and put us all out of our misery?) and continuing with the conceit upon which the plot is built. Give me a break. No general is going to send eight men--highly trained Rangers no less-- to their likely death to find one lousy guy. Sorry Mrs. Ryan. Then you have the cemetery scenes at beginning and end, and the Norman Rockwell shot of the Iowa farm house and the Norman Rockwell shot of the typists banging away letters of condolence and the flag waving in the breeze not once not twice but three times.

2018178,5,B0001NBLVI,"This WWII film is definitely one of Spielberg's crowning achievement as a director and film producer.  Although a rather  stereotypical story and arrangement of characters, the technical brilliance involved in the combat scenes more than makes up for the defects.

Personally, I just don't see the logic in the mission to save Private Ryan because he's the last surviving son of a family: what about those families who lost their only surviving sons? Was their loss not as great?  As for the technical aspects of the film, there are some minor flaws that don't add up such as the drowning soldiers being penetrated by German 8mm bullets when they're over 6' below water: physically impossible as those bullets would lose all momentum at that point!  Some details of the Tiger I tank shown in the film were also incorrect.  Other aspects in the screenplay were rather shallow such as where the 'evil' German Wermacht soldier is freed only to come back and kill the Jewish G.I. Please, this is a stereotypical theme that has been so overdone by Spielberg that it's quite frankly getting old and makes the characters appear as what they are: crude stereotypes.  Regardless as to his sensitivities on this subject, such generic categorization is beneath his talents.  I think Roman Polanski, who is also Jewish, handles the subtleties of WWII much better in his film 'The Pianist'(a really true story and outstanding film!) demonstrating that there were also many Jewish individuals who were as vile and deceitful to their own as the collaborators and demented fascists who joyfully carried out the political agendas of murderous sociopaths. He demonstrated that there were also many Germans in the Wermacht who were not ideologists but true officers and gentlemen who had compassion for human suffering no matter who the victims might have been.

Don't get me wrong, this is truly one of the best WWII films ever made in terms of accuracy and special effects.  The story however was rather weak in my opinion and tasted more like your typical Hollywood syrrup.  I find Spielberg's production of 'Band of Brothers' to be far superior to this film in terms of story line with action and effects that are just as realistic and authentic.",1114992000,6,2231,4.938502673796791
2018179,5,B0001NBLVI,"Steven Spielberg I always find is better when he does heartwarming stores(Close Encounters, E.T) or action type stuff(Jurassic Park, Minority Report) but now and then he wants to go ultra-realistic and while Schindler's List is a very nicely done film, it feels its length. Saving Private Ryan is 15 or so mins shy of 3 hours but never did it feel like it.

Inspired by a true story(although modified slightly), Private James Ryan is 1 of 4 brothers who are in war. 3 of them die however and to relieve the grief of the mother slightly, and maybe some good PR, they decide to send in a Captain to retrieve him and bring him home. Pretty simple story set against the backdrop of World War II and in particular the Invasion of Normandy.

Speaking of which, that scene is probably one of the most realistic war scenes ever filmed. Shot largely handheld the camera is always moving and zipping around and even going underwear than surfacing. One shot I didn't like although maybe it adds to the realism is when a soldier either through bullet hits or an explosion but his stomach is slashed so he's literally holding his guts. It shows the horrors of war yes but it felt a bit too over the top, especially with the guy screaming out. It's like they're trying to make you cry and disturbed when other scenes do it naturally.

The war scenes are violent and graphic yes. Soldiers are blown apart or severed in half, one gets his head blown off. It's extremely bloody but that adds to the realism, unlike Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor which was really tame considering the event, even the ""director's cut"" wasn't that bloody.

As for performances, they're likable without them being too overbearing. Tom Hanks plays that kind of steadfast captain who admits now and then he's done some wrongs. Everyone else is likable too, even Vin Diesel who to me has only done 2 good performances: this and Pitch Black. The kind of breakthrough though is Jeremy Davis playing Corporal Upham, a translator/map maker taken into war and is just scared ****less about what's going on.

The look of the film is interesting too cause the filmmakers color saturated the film to make it look the way it does and also cinematographer Kaminski is kinda famous for this grainy look, the film kind of looks ugly. But he did win for Best Cinematography so who am I to talk?

I don't find this film to be one of those re-watch over and over like I do with Aliens or Seven but now and then it's nice to pop it in and be entertained(or is that horrified and grossed out?)",1111968000,5,2532,4.553846153846154

There is nothing wrong with realism or grit. But there is something wrong with realism or grit if it isn't advancing the story's ideas further, if it isn't moving the characters or the viewers along. As it stands, what I had in my mind at the beginning of the movie was exactly what was there at the end. I came in, like most, with knowledge of the horror of WWII, and all the movie did was affirm this knowledge. I didn't learn anything from this movie; there was nothing in it that made me think and reach new conclusions.

There is no doubt that this movie is violent - but unlike some other producers that are interested in putting some sort of liberalized ""softball"" flick out there, Spielberg is a genius.  He gives it to you exactly as it was and as it should be portrayed.

War is not pretty, and this film is not pretty.  That isn't the point or the thrust of the film.  War can be and is hell, but what type of men and women are these that put on the uniform and are willing to make the sacrifices that so many Americans don't have the guts for?  What type of Americans did we have during that crucial time in world history?  These are the Americans that Tom Brokaw outlined in his excellent book, ""The Greatest Generation.""  No intelligent person would disagree that this was America's greatest generation - our grandpas and grandmothers that silently go about their business now, and the same people who had to endure and WIN one of our planets greatest struggles.

After seeing this film, you will not think about your WWII veteran grandparents the same way.  I read some reviews criticizing this films overtly American perspective.  Sorry, but you all desperately need to buy a clue... this is an American film made by a patriotic and very American director about American soldiers.  If you can't get with the program, ""Das Boot,"" ""Mein Kampf"" and Marx's ""Communist Manifesto"" is waiting for you.

2018186,2,B0001NBLVI,"Since Schindler's List, Spielberg has really been scraping the bottom of the barrel for decent stories. His friend Kubrick was nice enough to give him the idea to A.I., Minority Report's premise of underground psychics telling the future was embarrasing and Catch Me If You Can + The Terminal are lame attempts to put a Capra spin on otherwise true stories that don't work as films. Then there's Saving Private Ryan where Spielberg's lust for war is shown at full force with an incredibly lame story.

You know you can just say ""Um... its based on a true story."" Well that's not good enough. Here's what Hitchcock has to say on the subject matter of adaptating real stories into film in his famous interview with Truffaut;

""To put a situation into a film simply because you yourself can vouch for its authenticity, either because you've experienced it or because you've heard of it, simply isn't good enough. You may feel sure of yourself because you can always say 'This is true, I've seen it.' You can argue as much as you like, but the public or critics will not accept it.""

The problem is Saving Private Ryan takes a ""stranger than fiction"" story which is set up as comedic and places it smack bang in the middle of a serious overblown war epic. Speilberg made his cash but the film shows the evidence of a poorly constructed script. Pearl Harbor at least had the deceny to show that it wasn't intended as a realistic epic while this film promises alot but has nothing else to offer outside of the violence and that turns WWII into a joke.",1107475200,12,1545,4.5703971119133575

battle scenes do not have music score (which is what others should have done) and we see what we would have seen in real combat: horror of war. nothing clean or any platoon leader think he's the best like those '60s war movie.
it is also very americanized with the american flag at the beginning and at the end. it is a tribute to the american effort of the war but it also makes a small felling that lowers the effort of all the other allies: british, canadian, french resistance, chinese, australians and so on, because the flag makes you focus on USA (especially the amount of time your looking at the flag).",1107388800,6,945,4.375

2018190,5,B0001NBLVI,"I was completely blown away by ""Saving Private Ryan."" Spielberg, who (with the exception of ""Schindler's List"") only made warm entertainment before this, went against his usual ethics with this war film. And he succeeded.

""Saving Private Ryan,"" is without question one of the finest war movies ever made--possibly one of the finest movies ever. You don't really watch this film; you experience war, first-hand. The much-talked about scene, the Allied assault on Omaha Beach, is indeed extraordinarily brutal scene to watch, yet it is also mesmerizing at the same time.

The film follows a squad of U.S. soldiers on their PR mission to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers were all killed in combat. The squad is led by (Tom Hanks), a soldier's soldier, but all around a pretty good guy. The squad is portrayed by such actors as Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies in a superb role as the terrified translator.

The acting is very good all around. Hanks received an Oscar nomination, but the rest of the cast is excellent, most notably Davies and Edward Burns.

I was shocked that ""Saving Private Ryan"" didn't win Best Picture. It was one of the Academy's most shamefull moments. Luckily, Spielberg won for Best Director. It also won for Cinematography, which was basically all hand-held during the battle scenes. This worked wonders; it almost looked as though I was watching a documentary. The violence is extremely difficult to watch, but it worked for the film. Usually I have a problem with over-the-top violence (""Cliffhanger,"" anyone?), but I didn't mind it here. Spielberg was trying to make a point about war, and he definitely pulled it off, and then some. The film runs at nearly three hours, and yet I was completely fascinated the entire time. That is indeed a rare thing. I strongly recommend ""Saving Private Ryan.""",1098316800,11,1907,4.987421383647798
2018191,2,B0001NBLVI,"When I first saw this film, I was impressed with how the landing scene on Normandy captured the extraordinary bravery of those young men who looked death in the face and spit in its eye. I also thought the premise of the film in sending a group of soldiers to wander around looking for ""Private Ryan"" was a disappointment because it cheapened the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands who died liberating Europe from the forces of darkness. It also had the usual lapse of Hollywood history in asking ""where are the French?"" in liberating their own country. Having been to the cemeteries all over Europe, and the one at Colleville-sur Mer at Normandy where nearly 10,000 American dead are buried, I am always numb when I walk among the graves. The same is true at the British cemetery south of Bayeux, or the Douaumont Ossuaire near Verdun, the resting place of the remains of over 130,000 soldiers from all sides during WW I. This summer I went to the 60th anniversary ceremonies and talked to one of the French caretakers there about ""Saving Private Ryan."" My French is pretty good, but I thought I might have misunderstood him in his opinion about the film.  He was reluctant to talk, but finally said that he hated the film because the opening shot of the movie was really a defilement of the cemetery. When I asked him what he meant, he told me that Spielberg had moved massive amounts of equipment all over many graves unnecessarily because he wanted the shot to show two Stars of David monuments in the scene, and there is only one place that occurs among the over 9,300 crosses and a handful of other monuments identifying the faiths of those buried in the cemetery. I was stunned that Spielberg would do such a thing, but I guess he wanted to create some subliminal message in a very moving scene. I now cannot look at the movie without noticing this and thinking of what the caretaker said.

This movie is good for showing just what an incredible event the invasion of Normandy represented in the history of warfare, but the rest of it really does not properly represent why so many brave men gave their lives to save the world from a monster and his goons, when 80,000,000 died after Chamberlain delivered ""peace in our time"" in 1938.",1096761600,8,2245,4.596009975062344
2018192,4,B0001NBLVI,"As an ode to the sacrifice of American heroes on D-Day and beyond, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a masterpiece. As a sublime example of the art of ensemble performance, it is superb. As a depiction of the brutality and confusion of warfare, it is extraordinary, with a number of notable exceptions. The famous first 20 minutes, depicting the Allied landing at Omaha Beach are Steven Spielberg at his best. It's loud, confusing and lethal, with the clank of metal on metal and the sound of bullets seeming to zing past your ears.

The Hollywood touches just about sank this movie. The mawkish scenes at the beginning and end, showing an elderly soldier visiting the grave of Captain Miller, were emotionally out of character with the steely strength and determination of the characters in the rest of the film. And some of the walk-ons were just silly -- a blond Ted Dansen? Spielberg jammed this film full of typical war clichs -- guys on fire falling out of pillboxes, snipers in church towers, too many guys getting shot square in the forehead and soldiers navigating perfectly through a strange countryside using crappy maps. Mercifully, Spielberg makes up for these demerits with better scenes showing foolish assaults and improvised attacks.

But the star of the show was Tom Hanks. Setting aside his often comic personae, Hanks portrays a war-weary infantry officer doing a dubious duty as best he can. He keeps his men together (in company as well as in spirit), dreaming only of earning his way home with one noble act. It's a performance worthy of an armful of Oscars.

2018195,5,B0001NBLVI,"While watching this movie again, I was reminded how amazing it was. I hadn't seen it for awhile, but after the D-Day scene I was just glued to the screen. Even know I knew what was going to happen, it was just like watching it for the first time again. This is an absolutely amazing flick that has to be seen.

The story of a small platoon of marines travelling across France trying to find a Private James Ryan, is an interesting one. For the four of you who HAVEN'T seen this movie, James Ryan's three brothers were all killed in battle. The government has now sent a group of soldiers to go find the fourth brother and bring him back alive. The story is based around a Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad of marines.

This is not just a action/war movie. Yes, there are many battles and they are very well done. The D-Day invasion at the beginning of the movie is one of the most famous and incredible scenes in movie history. The end battle is also a great piece of movie making. But, there are many scenes used to develop the characters that you spend 2.5 hours with. It has heart and action. Which in my eyes, seperates it with many other war flicks. This is probably my favorite Spielberg film and I think I wouldn't be alone on that thought.

The acting is superb. Hanks, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and others are at their best. Hanks, of course, steals the show as the lead here. He is probably the best actor of my generation and he was on a serious role during the late 90's. I have always thought Burns was a bit overrated, but he is impressive here. Damon has some very good scenes, but he isn't in the movie till the latter half. Sizemore and the rest of the platoon are all memorable and likeable characters. Once again, Adam Goldberg makes me laugh out loud and he should be in more movies.

There are many moments where I was surprised by the nice shots that I was looking at. There is one shot where the guys are walking at night and the explosions off in the distance light up the screen. It is an absolutely amazing shot and there are many more of these moments in the movie. Spielberg really impressed me with how he shot this movie. Is has it's grainy, washed out look while still looking gorgeous at the same time. Like I said, Speilberg was at the top of his game here.

Is this the best war film ever made? Well, that I don't know. I think Platoon and Apocalypse Now are also very good. This movie just has more heart and substance to it. It looks amazing, sounds amazing and the acting is top-notch. The story is very interesting and it has the best of the best directing it. You can't go wrong here.

Special Features: Well, we finally have a special edition of this flick. The only features here are several featurettes on the making of the movie. Ran together, they run about 90 min. in length. It's very well put together and I guess I couldn't complain too much. I was just hoping for a little bit more considering all of these supplements could have been in the first release of this movie. And if there was any movie CRYING to have a commentary, it would be this one. I do like the features here, but it is ultimately disappointing.",1095465600,2,3232,4.351575456053068
2018196,5,B0001NBLVI,"This is Tom Hanks' most moving performance. Hanks play Captain John Miller.  It's a very emotional film, with Matt Da-mon ""Private James Ryan"", Barry Pepper ""Private Daniel Jack-son, the sniper"", Vin Diesel ""Private Adrian Caparzo"" and loads of other good actors. Janusz Zygmunt Kaminski is a wonderful cinematographer.  Steven Spielberg serves as both director and producer.  There is a wonderful screenplay by Robert Rodat.  John Williams Junior writes a wonderful score.  The violence is very brutal and aggressive, but not cheap Hollywood violence, but realistic, graphic, World War II violence.  Michael Kahn does some wonderful editing.  Denise Chaiman makes some wonder-ful casting choices.  Thomas E. ""Tom"" Sanders makes some wonderful sets.  Everyone gets their due credit here, for they've done a spectacular job of bringing horrifying images to the screen.  They've done some magnificent action sequences, won-derful special effects, and so forth.  I just saw Saving Private Ryan fo the first time tonight.  I'm a devout Spielberg fan.

2018198,5,B0001NBLVI,"In viewing this incomparable essay on the human spirit and the value of every human life, one can't help but be enthralled with the cinematic genius of Stephen Spielberg, his unbelievable cast, cinematographers, editors, sound men, special effects---truly the consummate cinematic experience.  But at the same time, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN addresses people like me, who haven't fought in any wars, and haven't seriously been affected by the loss of someone we loved in such a war.  Until you see a movie like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, war is merely a term meant to enable us to understand what a sick and violent world we live in.  I am still haunted by the powerful scenes in this movie, that opened my eyes to the terror and frustration, the fear and loneliness, of all these soldiers.  With Spielberg's brutal uncompromised look at what a bullet can do, I have come to respect even more the brave men who have fought for this country, who have died, who have been wounded, lost friends and comrades, and had to understand up close the fear and horror of war.

From the devastating opening sequence on the beaches of Normandy to the cataclysmic battle for the bridge, Spielberg helms a movie that is gutwrenching in its honesty, in its portrayal of war, and of the men who fought it.

The cast is impeccable.  Tom Hanks is truly magnificent as Capt. John Miller; Hanks never postures the megastar persona one might expect, but instead leads the actors as if they were his soldiers, and his performance overwhelms in its sincerity and humanity.  How can one single out any of the rest of this cast--they are absolutely great:  Edward Burns, Matt Damon, the underappreciated Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, even Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, Adam Goldberg, Harve Presnell--intelligent, thoughtful and convincing performances from them all.

In 2001, this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  This only substantiates the fact that the Oscars have succumbed to marketing strategies, studios putting tons of money into convincing voters that their movie is the best.  It is a disgrace that a film of the magnitude of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was eclipsed by the far inferior frothy comic antics of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  They even gave Judi Dench an Oscar for 8 minutes of hysterics, and ignored such Oscar worthy performances as Burns, Sizemore or Ribisi.

No matter, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not only the best movie of 2001, but one of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood.

But most of it is during the first half hour when it shows D-Day. Its about 8 soldiers go looking for James Ryan because all 3 of his brothers were K.I.A and he is the last one and they want him to go home. The ending is not what you expect. Its a great movie but its sad and its not funny at all. If you want a happy movie about barney or something don't watch this.

2018201,5,B0001NBLVI,"I have to say that Steven Spielberg's devastating opus concerning one of the turning point of World War II is a much more effective war film. Right from the start Spielberg throws the audience right into the meatgrinder to show that war is hell, but even through it all men rise up to do what is needed to survive and help their fellow soliders. The cinema verite documentary style Spielberg and his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used for the entirety of the Omaha Beach landing on D-Day is one of the best shot 30 minute of film ever. Other war films have shown the brutality of battle (Platoon and Hamburger Hill are two great examples), but that 30-minute opening sequence sans a score put the audience on the beach and through the fire the Germans put down on repel the men of the Allied invasion force. Spielberg's choice to forgo using no background music and just letting the sounds of the battle affected me more than anything else ever put on film. I am what one would call a gorehound and this opening sequence made me squirm and almost turn my eyes away from the screen.

The script is not as tight as that of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, but the dialogue remains strong enough to keep me interested in the fate of the men sent of to find Private Ryan. The slow parts of the film seem almost like a rest period from the sudden violence that sunddely came on the screen until the final battle for the bridge in the climax. It's almost as if Spielberg needed to give the audience a chance to catch their breath before being plunged back into hell.

The final battle may not have had the grand guignol and brutality of the opening sequence, but the complexity of the scenes and how the battle could be easily followed throughout the chaos and mayhem was astounding. I just couldn't imagine how he was able to pull off some of those shots and get them perfectly. Again, his documentary style of shooting the battle lent a realistic quality to the sequence. Even now, filmmakers have imitated and tried using the same techniques to show the chaos of battle. Spielberg has set the bar high when it comes to creating a film about war and people have tried to reach it, but still have to succeed. Whether one is anti-war or not, Saving Private Ryan is one film that take no sides but also makes an argument for either one. It is also one of the best filmmaking Spielberg has done and one of the best film in the last 20 years.",1091404800,3,2440,4.468609865470852

Those put off by the violence, grow up, thats how it was you stupid stupid person, although yes it is graphic it is also realistic.  The battle scenes are excellent and very realistically done, they are intense and graphic, just like the real thing.  The story is truly honorable, and dramatic.  The performances are great by most of the actors.  There is not one thing wrong with the movie, really.

2018203,5,B0001NBLVI,"We must recognize you can have three different visions about the war. You may have an epical approach (Spielberg, Schaffner) ; a tragic approach (Fuller, Stone) or a comical approach (Altman).
Surprisingly Spielberg has taken the first sight. And this is an interesting point to remark. Spielberg assumes that challenge because his personal style has been always to rescue the dignity and the best of the human being can give and even do in the most awful circunstances.
He never tells us story about loosers , nevertheless he always seeks events or edge knife situations where you must face and win. Let's forget all his sci fi proposals (whre he {s obviously a winner) and let's focus on the flesh and bond films.
In Ryan he reminds us the glorious D day .
No other movie in the story until now has shown more realism than this one ; the first thirty minutes of the film now has become in a classic.
He puts the attention about the private Ryan ; he doesn't talk about great challenges ; he refers about the humanity which lives in men even in the worst circunstances.
Schindler (his number 1 masterpiece ) runs by the same concept, but the concerns are major.

2018204,5,B0001NBLVI,"Some people I know complained that the movie was sad. But, if you're watching a war movie, chances are, it's gonna be sad. It's not going to be about fluffy bunnies and rainbows, if you know what I mean. Don't get me wrong though, it's pretty gory. A lot of close ups of people blowing up and losing limbs, but it's mainly in the Omaha Beach attack in the beginning. It doesn't really get any worse.
In the movie, four brothers went into WWII, three were K.I.A., and the fourth was still on the battlefront. A troop of eight(?) men were sent to save him, hence the title Saving Private Ryan. It's really in-depth...I could give you a better overview, but I'm only 12, gimmie a break!

This film shows the nasty details of war while at the same time graphicly exhibiting the unwanted necessity of a just war to combat evil.

For him this film brought back nightmares he hasn't had in 20 years but, he believes this film shows the honor of the doing the right thing at the right time. In the perverse world of war there is true honor and heroism. Anyone who cannot understand that war is sometimes necessary to defend good against evil is absolutely ignorant of history.

2018208,3,B0001NBLVI,"I'm not going to waste time on a comprehensive essay, because SPR has already been analyzed to death on both technical and artistic grounds.  Something like the Omaha Beach landing (or the breaching of Rommel's Atlantic Wall in general) is such a monumental event, it's hard to go wrong with a realistic portrayal because it speaks for itself.  Taken as a dramatic whole, SPR embodies all that is noble and all that is annoying about Spielberg, a man who earnestly brings all the awesome powers of filmmaking to bear on historical projects of fundamental significance yet falls short when it comes to trusting his audience and transcending clich.  Despite his undeniable talent and unquestionable sincerity, Spielberg all too often epitomizes American heavy-handedness.
[SPOILERS follow...]
There's one major story element that makes little sense and has always bothered me:  Consider Private Ryan.  The guy loses all three of his brothers, refuses an opportunity to go home in the face of a deadly threat, then stays behind to fight in a horribly pitched battle in which many fellow soldiers die while successfully defending a vital river crossing.  After all that, we're told, he's supposed to return home, invent a better lightbulb, and live like a saint in order to ""earn"" their sacrifice and give it meaning.  Theatrically effective, maybe, but my reaction was ""Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot?""  Miller's company gave their lives ELECTIVELY to hold an important bridgehead which might well have been lost otherwise, so it's not as though they died in vain. And Ryan himself has just shown great dedication to duty while enduring hellish combat and great personal loss--you'd think that might suffice to settle his account!
Hanks should've looked straight into the camera when he delivered that famous line, because WE are the ones who have to earn our soldiers' sacrifices whenever we send them off to die.  (That's just as applicable today, incidentally.) Combat veterans like the Pvt. Ryan depicted in this film have more than paid their dues, and they don't owe anyone a damn thing.",1086652800,33,2081,5.1513353115727005

2018211,5,B0001NBLVI,"Many people have seen this film and had different reactions. Most good some not. The story begins with the D-Day Invasion at Omaha beach. Capt John Miller (Tom Hanks) along with Sgt. Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore) lead a squad of Rangers onto the beach of Omaha at Normandy. The next 20-25 mintues are the most intense and realistic I have ever seen. The battle never slows down and does not cover up any realism. Blood, guts, shooting, explosions, men praying and calling out. It is all shown and should be. Some people may quesion why would anyone want to see this. Those of us that have served in the military want those who have not to see what it is like to serve in the military. Not for people to feel sorry for those who have, but to understand a different way of life. After the invasion, Miller is given an order that he and his squad must go behind German lines locate and bring back a Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon) from Iowa. It is no secret that his three brothers are now KIA! Some people complained that the characters where not real enough, or stereotypes. Isn't everyone given this? Before you meet them or after? Each platoon or squad in the military is like this, some nice men, others not! Plain and simple. Along for this mission is a new man to the group Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies) a interpreter. Men that had landed with Miller are the backbone of the film. Pvt. Reiben (Ed Burns) who likes black humor and has a quick temper, Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel) a large well hearted man. Many viewers have to look twice to realize that this is Diesel in an early role. His acting abilites are strongest in this film. A man deeply religious Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) and Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg) a Jew who toys with German prisoners about his religion. In the rear is Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) a medic who is caught in the wind of the war without a rifle. His job is simple yet could be anything but-save lifes.
As they go with this mission they begin to argue why are they trying to find one man when there are so many of them. What is so special about Pvt. Ryan? They have mothers too.
When they finally find him Ryan refuses to go since all his brothers are dead. He will not leave the ones he has left. Capt. Miller who has kept the squad together the best he can runs into a road block, stay and help defend the bridge or take Pvt. Ryan against his will and go. The final battle is no less brutal. It takes your breath away and won't let you go. It makes you appricitate freedom. People around the world need to understand that this is a film about Americans in WWII. Were not saying we won the war ourself. We didn't. That a squad would not walk so close in the open and talk. Used to keep the movie going, thats it. Battle scene's too brutal. People also need to see what it is like for those who serve there country in the military so they may live free! Winner of 5 Academy Awards. Best Director Spielberg, also won for cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects editing. Best film and most important one I have ever seen.

2018212,1,B0001NBLVI,"Stinks. Sadistic, racist, mendacious, crude, nationalistic propaganda. Oh, yes, I too was fooled to start with. But you can't fool all of the people all the time. Seeing this garbage the first time, I was knocked out. But it wasn't long before feelings of unease set in. 18 months later I've come to believe this is one of the vilest and most cynical films ever produced to con the dumb masses. Nobody ever went bust underestimating the brains or taste of the suckers. Goebbels would be proud. The story is idiotic. Brain-dead.  It gains specious credibility from being presented in an apparently historical framework. The history is selectively distorted, misrepresented beyond belief. The beginning and ending are fabulously realistic. Oh yeah? Think twice, and you realise that the beginning is founded on comic film shorts from the 50s and 60s, Bugs Bunny, Road Runner, etc, where cartoon characters have their heads blown off (and grow new ones), run around carrying their arms and legs, take off their tin hats and get a poke between the eyes. Roars of laughter from the 10 year olds. The ending is based on arcade space invader games: endless numbers of faceless monsters come at you from all sides and get zapped: Pow! Pow! Pow! Wow! Zowie! Kerplatt!

Racism is when  there is no differentiation between individuals. A man is viciously hated simply because of the way he looks, or the language he speaks, or the way he dresses. This film is nationalistic racism at its purest. Like they used to say in the Old West: ""The only good Injun is a dead Injun.""  Soldiers in war know it's either kill or be killed. But they also know that their enemy is another soldier, haplessly doing his duty, like themselves. For this they respect him, unless they are pathological sadists, brutalized beyond repair.

The ""bookends"" of this film (the Matt Damon character at the cemetary) is pretty heavy-handed as well, I found it hard not to laugh when the old guy went through the whole ""tell me I'm a good man"" thing.
The staging of the combat scenes is amazing and worth the price of admission, but don't expect a great story. At least not one as good as the real thing. Stick with ""Band of Brothers"" for a better narrative.",1086134400,7,863,4.468354430379747
2018214,5,B0001NBLVI,"MOVIE: One of the greatest war films ever made finally has a little justice on DVD. Steven Spielberg loves WWII, he is really fascinated with it. Saving Private Ryan is the true story of a group of men risking their lives for one. Really people see this movie being about the horrors of war but in truth its about finding decency within this war. The movie really spends most of its time focusing on the character of Captain Miller and his journey to find himself. Spielberg even mentions this in the ""making of"". What this movie has done really well are the editing and the camera work. When combined we have a very genuine feel to the movie and not something churned out by Hollywood such as Windtalkers. The movie also deals with the issues of teamwork and brotherhoods. War is a very unique in that soldiers go into it wanting to fire big guns but in the midst of it they realize more about themselves then ever before, and this movie demonstrates that very well. The opening D-Day scene is intense and probably one of the best edited scenes of all time. Not only will Saving Private Ryan show you the horrors of war like any other war film could, but it will show you how men learn about themselves and human nature within it.

VIDEO: Excellent transfer with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The picture is very sharp and very clear as it should be.

AUDIO: No DTS, but a top of the line Dolby 5.1. Excellent sound for a movie that won one of its Oscars for sound.

PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I love the packaging of this set. It is modeled after an ammo cartridge box used in the war. It's made of very hard cardboard and is very sturdy. The case opens like a box, not like a book. One disc sits in the door of the box and the other is sitting in the bed of it. Very unique. As for extras, there is just enough to make you buy this set, but nothing to go crazy over. The first release was almost stripped bare except for trailers and an interview with Spielberg, but at least here we have a decent look into the movie. The featurettes are very basic actually, just focusing on how Spielberg came to direct the film, the history of the war, the characters, the D-Day scene, a boot camp featurette, sound, and a few others. I'm glad that this set just didn't talk about history and stuff like that and actually looked into the making of the film itself. At least it was better than Schindler's List in terms of extras. I wish they had the trailers on the set though so if I want to watch them I don't have to get out my old set. Overall they just put enough to get the grade, nothing above and beyond.
