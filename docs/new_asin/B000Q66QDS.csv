2831836,3,B000Q66QDS,"Beyond the fiction of Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code lies a truth hidden in mystery and shrouded in the sands of time.  With humor and intelligent conviction, Tim Wallace-Murphy reveals where his research has shown the true bloodline of faith comes from and leads to.

If you've enjoyed the tale in Mr. Brown's book or movie, you'll appreciate the even more fascinating revelations in The Real Bloodline.",1199836800,,403,4.911764705882353
2831837,4,B000Q66QDS,"This is a fascinating interview with retired psychologist and cultural historian, Tim Wallace-Murphy, about the latter-day descendants of Jesus and role of Gnosticism and the Knights Templar, among other things. Wallace-Murphy, whose writing was used by Dan Brown when writing The DaVinci Code, says, ""Yes, there are countless people descended from Jesus still around. I know quite a few of them who, knowing that, say So what? Does it matter?"" What matter, he says, is what they are doing with their own lives now. While it helps to have some knowledge of the subject matter, Wallace-Murphy speaks conversationally and with humor about his professional and spiritual quest.",1198627200,,674,5.308411214953271
8194452,4,B000Q66QDS,"I really like most of the work that Philip Gardiner is involved in. This is basically just an interview with Tim Wallace-Murphy. At times, Mr Wallace-Murphy's voice fades to a near inaudible whisper. I think there was two places that I could hear a couple words and that was disappointing. It seems a lot of people complain that the music is too loud in the mix and it steps on the conversation. I do not agree. The music is perfect and in fact sets Philip Gardiner productions in a class of their own. I don't know why this is called ""The Real Bloodline"" as it has nothing to do with the question of Jesus' offspring. It should have been called The Real Grail.",1430265600,2,661,4.382113821138211

8194455,3,B000Q66QDS,"It is always a disappointment when the background music covers some of the words said (at least for me).  It does wet the appetite for what is in his books.

8194456,4,B000Q66QDS,"This is an extremely interesting interview with author and historian Tim Wallace-Murphy. One of his books was used as research for the ""DaVinci Code"" and in this film we learn about the true bloodline of Jesus Christ. It astounds me to think that I could actually know someone who is related to Jesus.",1236124800,,301,4.69811320754717

8194458,4,B000Q66QDS,"This is consistently compared to the Davinci Code but I found this to be far more interesting.  Although the truth is in the eye of the beholder or watcher, the historical perspectives are interesting and clearly well researched.  Watch and determine your truth.",1206576000,,262,5.069767441860465
8194459,1,B000Q66QDS,"Wallace Murphy appears to be a man of great experience and wisdom who certainly has impressive credentials relating to the subject matter of ""The Real Bloodline"".  All of this is lost in the production of this DVD.  You have to wonder why someone of Mr. Wallace's stature would be a part of such an amateur production.  Could it be that there is a ""Da Murphy Code"" shrouded in the DVD?  Could it be that the ""Da Murphy Code"" cannot sell unless it is entwined with ""The Da Vinci Code""?

 The production of this DVD is no better than that of a high school student creating a DVD for a school assignment beginning the effort 18 hours before the due date.  Background music fades in and out with no real function that often obscures what is being said by Mr. Murphy.  The video cuts from color to black and white; an apparent attempt to divert attention from the lack luster setting.  Images are superimposed over the speaker from time to time, which surely are connected but are not woven into the presentation leaving the viewer to wonder exactly their purpose.

 The biggest disappoint with ""The Real Bloodline"" is the interview itself.  Mr. Murphy is asked a serious of questions that broadly outline the subject matter; rambling on with little structure and no follow up.  What is offered is a few interesting points for the viewer to ponder, nothing more.

 Like so many of us who struggled through High School, our last minute reports started out with one idea and ended with another.  The DVD carries the title of ""The Real Bloodline"" but fails to cover this subject.  Mr. Murphy dismisses the bloodline story as interesting but not important.  What is important to Mr. Murphy is his personal spirituality, which he shares with the viewer.  I do not doubt Mr. Murphy's sincerity or the effort he has put into his spiritual quest.  Unfortunately, his grade is F because he did not complete the assignment.  Perhaps if the assignment had been to give a report on ""The Da Murphy Code"" a better grade could have been obtained.",1205280000,6,2026,4.666666666666667

8194461,4,B000Q66QDS,"If you're like me and were fascinated by the DaVinci Code, you will really enjoy this film.  Whether you believe in it or not, the theories and history behind the real bloodline cannot help but captivate.  Like many others, I particularly like the feminist bent to this take on history and religion.  An interesting piece by an established scholar.  I recommend it.",1204934400,,365,4.838709677419355
