The settings on this movie are great, dark rooms deep in an old castle. Price's father was a part of the Spanish Inquisition and an evil man. From his time as a small boy Price is haunted by terrifying memories of his father's insanity, his killings which included his mother and uncle. When Price's adulterous wife fakes her death to drive him crazy she finds that betrayal on her part cuts both ways. Of course Price in a way only he could play becomes his wife's judge, jury, and her executioner.

1261610,5,B000038IFO,"THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM [1961] [Limited Edition SteelBook] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] The Greatest Terror Tale Ever Told!

A horse-drawn carriage pulls up on a deserted beach. A sombre figure dismounts and gazes up towards his destination and a foreboding cliff-top castle perched high above the crashing waves. Thus the perfect Gothic scene is set for The Pit and the Pendulum, the second of Roger Cormans celebrated Poe adaptations once again starring the ever-reliable Vincent Price [The Fall of the House of Usher and Theatre of Blood] alongside the bewitching Barbara Steele [Black Sunday].

Having learned of the sudden death of his sister Elizabeth [Barbara Steele], Francis Barnard [John Kerr] sets out to the castle of his brother-in-law, Nicholas Medina, to uncover the cause of her untimely demise. A distraught, grief-stricken Nicholas [Vincent Price] can offer only the vaguest explanations as to Elizabeths death and at first citing something in her blood, but later asserting that she quite literally died of fright. What sort of unspeakable horrors are buried within the walls of this castle that could cause ones heart to stop so? With Francis determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, the terrible truth will not stay buried for long.

Right from its brooding kaleidoscopic opening titles, Pit and Pendulum draws you into its world of cobwebs, secret passageways and dusty suits of armour. All the necessary elements are present and correct and, along with one of Vincent Prices most tortured performances, make The Pit and the Pendulum every inch the Gothic masterpiece.

FILM FACT: The film's brief exterior prologue showing John Kerr's arrival to the castle was filmed on the Palos Verdes coast. The rest of the production was shot in four interior sound stages at the California Studios in Hollywood. To provide greater freedom for the planned camera movements, a castle set with many levels and ample space was designed by Daniel Haller. The film's press book noted that the pendulum was eighteen-feet long and weighed over a ton and was constructed with a realistic rubber cutting blade. The pendulum was rigged from the top of the sound stage thirty-five feet in the air. In an interview, Daniel Haller provided details regarding the creation of the pendulum. To visually enhance the size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40 mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted at the opposite end of the stage, giving Floyd Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Between the years of 1960 and 1965, legendary director/producer Roger Corman would set out to create numerous cinematic adaptations of the works of Edgar Alle Poe. These films would later be known as the Corman-Poe Cycle. Repeatedly utilizing the same sets, and (mostly) the same creative team, the endlessly frugal Roger Corman crafted eight memorable classics that we are all still enjoying today. After the surprising popularity of The Fall of the House of Usher, Roger Corman would bring another Poe tale to the silver screen the following year, namely The Pit and the Pendulum. Roger Corman producer, director, and veteran of horror and sci-fi filmmaking have been a name associated with the rite of passage into scary films for countless generations of fans. The King of the B movies has been making films for over sixty years, boasting an extensive filmography that others can only dare to dream of in terms of output.

Arrow Video has done it again in bringing out another fantastic and brilliant release of the UK Blu-ray Limited Edition SteelBook of Edgar Allan Poes The Pit and the Pendulum, the 1961 follow-up to The Fall of the House of Usher, once again directed by Roger Corman and starring Vincent Price alongside Barbara Steele and Luana Anders. ""100,000 if you die of fright"" screamed one of the original posters for this gloriously outr film. It's not clear if anyone ever claimed that money, and modern viewers seem to survive more extreme horror all the time, but nevertheless the poster sets the tone well for a story which does its best to pull every scary trick in the book.

From the tortured mind of Edgar Allen Poe, the articulated pen of Richard Matherson and the directorial eye of a young Roger Corman came one of the great gothic horror films of the 1960s; The Pit and the Pendulum. On release in 1961, the film became an instant hit with both critics and audiences alike. The plaudits ranged from a physically stylish, imaginatively photographed horror film (Variety) to a thoroughly creepy sequence of horrors (New Yorker) and perhaps the most tellingly a class suspense-horror film of the calibre of the excellent ones done by Hammer (Hollywood Reporter).

Certainly Roger Corman succeeded in crafting one of the most arresting openings in any Gothic horror film, balancing it at the end with a wildly extravagant finale and bolstering the body of the picture with eerily tinted flashbacks and a creepily effective tomb-rising for Steele. Introducing the action, rivulets of luridly coloured paints bleed into each other to the accompaniment of composer Les Baxters sombre atonalities, suggesting nothing so much as the interbreeding blood vessels of the mind.

The Pit and the Pendulum is the second Edgar Allan Poe adaptation by Roger Corman. It came out after the enormous success of his version of House of Usher. That film came to be after Roger Corman suggested instead of making two more black and white horror films, why not make a colour one? It turned out to be the most successful film for American International Pictures of that time.

The kaleidoscopic opening and closing credits are wonderfully delirious; rounding off a brilliantly filmed body of work is reminiscent of the Saul Bass and early James Bond credit sequence design, feeling completely at home with the tone of the film in the process conveying the perfect chaos of a descent into madness and panic.

Francis Barnard arrives in 16th Century Spain is the locale, after the mysterious death of his sister Elizabeth [Barbara Steele] Francis Barnard [John Kerr] travels to visit his brother in law, Nicholas Medina [Vincent Price] son of a brutal torturer from the Spanish inquisition to discover the true events surrounding her death which will shock the audience unravelling a greater mystery. Vincent Price empowers every frame that he appears in, his tortured character is a perfectly realised; a trait which Price delivers with gusto and believability, the audience can feel the grief of Nicholas as he offer vague explanations of Elizabeths death whilst dealing with the tortuous exploits of his father. The turmoil and despair or Nicholas is portrayed perfectly with the use of Prices expressions, his eyes powerfully emotive and Roger Corman exploits this in lavish close ups allowing the man to act his very soul out particularly in his descent to madness.

Vincent Price, however, is the star of the film gives one of his best unhinged performances of a career comprised of many; the last 15 minutes alone are up there with his best work. Vincent Price was very happy to be associated with Roger Corman on the Edgar Allan Poe films because it helped his slumping career and had some cachet of quality. He would star in all of them bar one, The Premature Burial.

Flashbacks of the bewitching Elizabeth are washed in dreamlike hues of light blue, these sequences are used masterfully with Prices distinct voice carrying the audience whilst an emotive and passionate score divulges and lulls the audience to the tragic events that Nicholas is reliving. These flashbacks are an important tool that Roger Corman and cinematographer Floyd Crosby utilise to drive character emotion in effect urging the viewers emotive response, colour is equally as important, one such startlingly violent flurry is drenched in a warm orange glow drawing the viewer into the acts thrusting their feelings toward that of the young Nicholas, events which haunt him in adulthood.

However, I have to admit that I was not a huge fan of actor John Kerr, who portrayed the resolute Francis Barnard. It is his unexpected appearance and subsequent search for answers that is the lynchpin of the film; this should be Francis Barnards story. But in the end, Francis is basically a mere plot device to move things along, while Vincent Price gets to shine in the role of Nicholas Medina.

The horror film is rich in Edgar Allan Poe-like themes, incidents and atmosphere and a cursed heritage, a doomed mansion, crepuscular dungeons, premature burial, revenants. Vincent Price's animated performance, alternating between menace and madness, is highlighted by the po-faced supporting cast. The British actress Barbara Steele, who had already become a ""scream queen"" in Italian horror flicks, here makes her first and only Hollywood film as Vincent Price's wife, but because of her supposed regional accent she was dubbed.

The Pit and the Pendulum has more-than retained its power to chill and enthral, and if you give it a chance it will gladly crawl under your skin and reside there. As far as cinematic climaxes go, there aren't many that can top the pendulum once it is in full swing, and as far as films from the immortal Roger Corman go, there are none better and yes, that includes The Masque of Red Death. Each discovery in the plot proves to be yet another lie; Richard Mathesons script is so full of twists that I feel like the whole storyline almost loses its plausibility. In a way, this is pretty clever: I started mirroring Francis emotions of suspicion and dissatisfaction, not knowing who and what to believe anymore. The final revelation that is only exposed to Nicholas and the viewer is pretty shocking, but suddenly the whole travesty finally makes sense. The tragic ending is absolutely brilliant and a memorable image that will last forever in the cinema horror film genre.

If you consider the names involved with The Pit and the Pendulum like Roger Corman, Vincent Price, Barbara Steele then this film represents a coming-together of some unique talent in the genre. A classic piece that, even today, remains timeless and beautifully crafted. This restoration is sure to please all fans of gothic horror, and the extras, and quality package to make this an attractive piece for any Blu-ray collectors library.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This 1080p HD upgrade onto limited edition Blu-ray is taken from original film elements, provided by MGM. The quality of the picture allows the viewer to absorb themselves in the gothic grandeur of the film. The crystal clear print showcases the rich, bold colours and minute details in such fantastic clarity it is difficult to believe this film is 54 years old. Providing the original widescreen format also gives the opportunity to see just how ambitious and vast the sets were, each shot framed perfectly and presented as originally intended. When you consider just how low-budget this film was, it is exceptionally well crafted and beautiful to look at. The print shows no damage and no evidence of obvious digital enhancements, with a nice feeling of cinematic grain that compliments its age and feel. You will be well impressed with the handsome, richly detailed 1080p transfer with a really sumptuous generous contrast range and terrific colour, something that leaps from the screen in the film's psychedelic opening images. There is occasionally some very slight picture movement and a few very brief instances of dirt remain, but otherwise this is a sparkling restoration that beautifully showcases the films richly realised cinematography, production design and matte work. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director and Producer Roger Corman: For my money, Roger Corman has one of the most interesting voices in the known universe and listening to him is one of the most interesting you are ever likely to encounter and even he read out from a telephone director, it would still sound good and even better if Roger Corman did audio books for the blind it, would be a No. 1 winner every time. The audio commentary here is no exception, with the director providing information on all aspects of the film's production, including: the selection of actors; working with composer Les Baxter; the paintings that adorn the walls; his more confident use of CinemaScope following his first use of the format in House of Usher; the matte paintings; the distorted imagery and colour tinting; and a whole load more. His admiration for Vincent Price as an actor is clear, and he provides a frank and detailed breakdown of the film's Freudian undertones and it did not occur to me that the castle was designed to be read as a woman's body and you live and learn something out of the blue from as always Roger Corman. Roger Corman also informs us that to create the flashbacks revealing Nicholas' traumatic experiences, Roger Corman and Floyd Crosby attempted to shoot them in a manner that would convey to the audience the character's horror in dredging up nightmares trapped in his subconscious. Roger Corman insisted on these images having a dream-like quality, ""twisted and distorted because they were being experienced by someone on the rim of madness"". Roger Corman decided to film the flashbacks in monochrome, since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in ""black-and white"" imagery. Floyd Crosby used wide-angle lenses, violent camera movement, and tilted camera angles to represent the character's feeling of hysteria. The sequences were then printed on blue-tinted stock which was subsequently toned red during development, effectively producing a two-tone image. The highlights were blue, with the shadows rendered as red and producing a deep, bloody quality. The image was then run through an optical printer where the edges were vignette and a twisted linear distortion was introduced. Another interesting fact we hear is that Roger Corman has noted that making the film was a pleasurable experience: ""I enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum because I actually got the chance to experiment a bit with the movement of the camera. There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting cutting in the climax of the film."" Roger Corman also informs us that the filming went smoothly, and Roger Corman attributed the ease of the production's shoot to the short but comprehensive pre-production planning he did with the major technicians.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Critic Tim Lucas: Novelist and Video Watchdog editor Tim Lucas delivers a compelling reading of the film and provides a brief biography on the actors in the film and a complex analysis of the film's subtext. He also discusses the CinemaScopes compositions, the moody music score, and Richard Matheson's original script, which he quotes from. Critic Tim Lucas gives his not so nice and bitter review of Vincent Price's performance, which he was totally out of order to say such negative views, as Vincent Price in my mind can do no wrong in whatever film he appears in and always gives a 100% professional performance and if people who went to see his films did not like what they saw on the screen, then Vincent Prices career would be a very short one indeed. He also comments on the film's similarities to Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, and the influence of Edgar Allan Poe's original story. One interesting fact is that this commentary was recorded on the 250th anniversary of Edgar Allen Poe's birth.

Special Feature: Behind the Swinging Blade [43:07] This newly made documentary on the making of The Pit and the Pendulum and is the work of Arrow Video regular Callum Waddell, that looks back at the making of the film through interviews with producer-director Roger Corman, actress Barbara Steele, and director Brian Yuzna, journalist and film historian David Del Valle, and Vincent Price's daughter Victoria. Barbara Steele tells us that she loved Vincent Price and claims that her voice was not dubbed in the film, well that is the official version it was. Brian Yuzna recalls his first viewing of the film and his opinion that Barbara Steele was great in anything she appeared in and they get my vote any time. David Del Valle states that ""All of us who grew up with Vincent Price owed him a debt of gratitude."" Victoria Price nicely describes her father's later screen image as ""the elegant side of evil."" And there are loads more stuff to get your teeth into here. This is totally fascinating and well worth a view.

Special Feature: Added TV Sequence [5:04] Shot in 1968 to pad out the film for the longer TV time slot, this scene features star Luana Anders. An extra sequence shot by Roger Corman's assistant Tamara Asseyev, that was added for the film's television screening in 1968 to enable it to fill a 2-hour time slot, which gives you an idea just how many commercial breaks there must have been. The sequence in question has Catherine Medina imprisoned in an asylum, and watching it in isolation it's hard to imagine exactly how it fitted into the film.

Special Feature: An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe with Vincent Price  [1970]  [53:07] Vincent Price reads a selection of Edgar Allan Poes classic stories before a live audience, including The Tell-Tale Heart, The Sphinx, The Cask of Amontillado and The Pit and the Pendulum. Vincent Price delivers this performance with his usual gravitas and passion, every word he utters an embodiment of the terror and tension that Poe could conjure with his words. This is a superb feature and showcases the powerful presence of Vincent Price as he captivates the audience in his telling of these stories with such gusto that it is hard not to get sucked into every tale. Vincent Price is in full flow here, notably in expressing the anguish and torment of the characters from whose viewpoint each of the stories are told. Just occasionally you want him to rein it in a tad, but this is still a valuable, hugely enjoyable and most appropriate inclusion. Handily, this feature has chapter stops at the start of each story. Directed by Kenneth Johnson. Screenplay by David Welch (television adaptation) and Kenneth Johnson (television adaptation). Produced by Dan Kibbie, James H. Nicholson, Kenneth Johnson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. Music by Les Baxter.

Theatrical Trailer [1961] [1080p] [2:30]This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for The Pit and the Pendulum, which gleeful revels all the terror the audience were to experience by going to see the film. This is an intriguing trailer that has a few dust spots but is otherwise in decent shape and it is in the correct scope ratio. Structurally it's a little wobbly and has a couple of serious spoilers, but the voice-over is great fun, assuring us in all sincerity that the film has ""all the violence of angry seas."" Come again?

BONUS: Beautiful Printed and Designed Reversible Limited Edition SteelBook Packaging especially from the excellent colour cover art to a glorious presentation of a Vincent Price classic front and back. Plus Black-and-White photo images on the inside of the SteelBook from the film The Pit and the Pendulum.

BONUS: Beautiful Designed Collectors 22 page booklet featuring new writing on the film by Gothic Horror author Jonathan Rigby, illustrated with original archive stills and posters. The centrepiece of this typically fine full colour booklet is a fascinating essay on the film and its release by American Gothic: Sixty Years of Horror Cinema by author Jonathan Rigby entitled THE WAITING PIT OF HELL [2014] which includes an examination of Vincent Price's performance and the critical response to it and some choice technical information on the pendulum sequence. There are also plenty of stills and the main film credits, and I really liked the fact that the page numbers are framed in a small pendulum blade. Finally, on page 21 we get information on ABOUT THE TRANSFER; PRODUCTION CREDITS and SPECIAL THANKS.

Finally, Arrow Video has certainly pulled out all the stops as usual on this Blu-ray Limited Edition SteelBook release. The Pit and the Pendulum is a fine addition to AIPs Roger Corman and Edgar Allan Poe cycle. It is atmospheric, beautifully shot, and features one of Prices best performances. Though the film takes its time to unravel, the film runs at a really brisk eighty one minutes, so it never becomes a chore to watch. I definitely think The Pit and the Pendulum especially to fans of classic horror genre, and Im pleased to give it a star rating of 10 out of 10 and well worth purchasing and now totally honoured to be added to my ever increasing Vincent Price Blu-ray Collection, especially via the very professional Arrow Video people, who should be totally congratulated in bringing out these beautifully crafted Horror films. Very Highly Recommended!

Theatrical Trailer is a staple for these Midnite Movie releases and that is okay by me.
The movie is dramatic, horror driven and has one of the best horror endings you will ever see on the movie screen!
Well done! Can't wait to get the Vincent Price box sets of his movies in Hi Def. soon as well.

1261658,5,B000038IFO,"At age eight in '61, I was still wiping sweat and snot on my tee-shirt sleeves when I first saw this one in the theater. But by my second viewing last night, I would have a greater appreciation for what I'd been looking at. Which was one of prolific cheapie filmmaker Roger Corman's eight soaring adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories, 1960-65. If ""Pit"" was in fact made on his typical budget, you have a hard time noticing given the fully convincing costumes and creepy sets from 1546 Spain. Good enough to merit Oscar attention I'd say, had critics bothered assessing the output of a director previously responsible for classic 1950's drive-in fodder such as ""Swamp Women"" and ""Attack Of The Crab Monsters"".

Anyhow, Corman/Poe build a story around a secluded oceanfront castle owned by Nicholas Medina/Vincent Price, son of an infamous Spanish Inquisition torturer fortunately deceased. The heritage and his wife's untimely recent death make it tough enough maintaining a mental equilibrium, but really mindbending things start to happen after brother-in-law Francis Barnard/John Kerr arrives from England to inquire into his sister Elizabeth Barnard Medina/Barbara Steele's passing. Nicholas's sister Catherine/Luana Anders and personal physician Dr. Charles Leon/Antony Carbone lend A- dramatic support in a teensy cast of essentially five. There's a satisfying ending, darkness of the material considered. Famed bandleader Les Baxter (who had a couple of #1 single records in the mid-fifties) provides a B+ music track.

With any warm memories dating back to childhood, it's often difficult to suspend your nostalgia and form any reasonably objective judgement. But today there's enough external support to verify that P & P was as good as I'm thinking it was.",1430265600,,1767,5.307142857142857

1261723,4,B000038IFO,"In the original 1842 Edgar Allan Poe short story, a nameless narrator is condemned to death by the Spanish Inquisition.  He is first placed in a dark room where there is a deep pit in the floor, into which he almost stumbles.  Although he avoids this trap, he awakens to find himself strapped to a table over which a mechanical, clockwork blade swings, descending toward him with each swing.  He manages to escape the machine, but now the walls become red hot and push him toward the pit.  He is rescued at the last possible moment by the French army, which has taken the city.  The story is memorable for the way in which Poe describes the various tortures--but in spite of this, and in spite of its fame, it has little in the way of character or plot, and it is essentially a description of the elaborate tortures the narrator endures.

Enter Roger Corman, a ""B"" director best known for creating drive-in dreck on a low budget and insanely fast shooting schedule.  When these films began to fall out of favor, Corman coaxed American International Pictures into backing a color adaptation of Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher.""  Filmed for $300,000 in fifteen days and starring Vincent Price, the film grossed $1,450,000 and spurred everyone concerned to a follow-up.  After various complications (Corman originally wanted to film Poe's ""The Masque of the Red Death,"" a film he would make with Price in 1964), everyone agreed on ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  Like THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER, it was filmed for $300,000 in fifteen days--and this time racked up $2,000,000 in its original release.  Corman and Price would go on to make a total of eight films together, all but one one (The Terror) at least vaguely based on various works by Poe.

Only the last ten or so minutes are actually based on Poe's story.  The main body of the film seems inspired by a number of Poe stories and borrows rather liberally from Corman's earlier THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER.  When he receives word that his sister Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) has died under mysterious circumstances, Francis Barnard (John Kerr) travels from England to Spain to confront Elizabeth's husband, Don Nicholas Medina (Vincent Price), who resides in a gloomy fortress with his own sister, Dona Catherine (Luana Anders.)  After considerable deception on Don Nicholas' part, Francis learns that Elizabeth died of fright after becoming fascinated by the castle's ancient torture chamber, which was presided over by Don Nicholas' long dead father.  Don Nicholas is plauged by the fear that Elizabeth was not dead, but was buried alive, and he believes her ghost has returned to exact revenge upon him for this.  The plot, already complicated, takes several more twists before its characters arrive in the lowest depths of the torture chamber, where Francis finds himself strapped to a table beneath the infamous pendulum.

In some ways the film is slightly ridiculous.  In theory, the film is set in Spain about 1850.  In practice, it is a 1960s notion of a Spanish Never-Never Land in which men still wear doublets and everyone speaks with either English or American accents.  Barbara Steele was much admired for her horror films, but her appearance here is little more than a cameo.  Kerr is a bit stiff and Anders is a bit throwaway, and the film essentially rests upon Vincent Price, who is at times remarkably subtle and at times pure ham.  Nonetheless, the film looks great and it moves at a tremendous clip.  The thrills and chills it offers may be a bit dated, but it is never dull, and more than fifty years later THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM still has the most jaw-dropping final shot I've ever seen in any horror film.  The film is also noteworthy for occasional psychedelic flourishes, most particularly in the opening and closing credits, the pendulum sequence, and the odd, often electronic inflected music.

The film has been widely available on DVD in several issues.  The MGM ""Midnight"" edition has several extras, including a mildly interesting commentary by Corman himself.  Whatever the case, this is a great popcorn movie: gather the family, break out the refreshments, and let Vincent and friends carry you away.  Recommended.

1261775,5,B000038IFO,"During his career Vincent Price would build a reputation for starring in horror films. Starting in 1960 he would make a series of movies with Producer/Director Roger Corman based on the stories of Edgar Allen Poe. They made quite a few good movies (""The Masque of the Red Death"" and ""Tales Of Terror"" among them) but the best I think of the bunch was their second movie ""The Pit And The Pendulum"". Set in a Spanish castle Vincent Price gives one of his very best acting performances as a man who is slowly going insane. As a young boy seeing his mother buried prematurely by his father affects him throughout his life. With the recent passing of his wife (or so he thinks since his wife, played by Barbara Steele, faked her own death) Price comes to believe that she may have been prematurely buried too. It is all a game however as she and her lover try to drive Price to commit suicide so she can inherit his money. But the plan works way to well in driving Price insane and soon he believes he is his father who was an assassin during the Spanish Inquisition and soon she finds it is her life that is about to end and this time for real.

Along with Price and Steele ""Pit and the Pendulum"" also stars John Kerr as Steele's brother who comes to the castle looking for answers as to how and why his sister died and Anthony Carbone who plays Steele's lover and Price's doctor in on driving Price insane. Of course Roger Corman produces and directs the film and this is one of his better works. The script was written by Richard Matheson one of the best movie and TV writers around. He wrote the screenplays for such movies as ""Somewhere In Time"" and ""The Omega Man"" among others and wrote some of the best episodes on televisions ""Twilight Zone"".

All in all a good movie to add to your video collection whether you are a Vincent Price fan or a fan of the stories of Edgar Allen Poe. This is good old fashion horror the way it use to be made back in the '60s that will entertain and keep you in suspense as you become involved in the story.",1369008000,,2040,4.309895833333333

The Pit And The Pendulum (1961) is based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name.  This movie delivers a fine adaptation of this story, although not 100% faithful.  Vincent Price's performance is solid as usual, as is Barbara Steele's.  There is a creepy, dark gothic atmosphere throughout.  The ending is classic.  A nail biter.  You might feel this movie moves a little slow in the beginning and middle, but the ending makes up for the slowness.

Overall, this is a horror classic that I recommend to all fans of horror movies and especially fans of the horror movies of yesteryear who appreciate the classics that laid the foundation for what was to come in the future, not to mention all the remakes of horror movies nowadays.",1354147200,2,851,4.73469387755102

Price is my fav horror actor and he was perfectly matched with Roger Corman and Edgar Allan Poe to provide this minor masterpiece that still chills me!

This was remade several times, under various titles, but the only remake worth watching (as well as mentioning) is from 1991 starring Lance Heinrickson.",1352505600,,578,4.877551020408164

1261842,1,B000038IFO,"...and about as frightening as baby kittens.

Given Roger Corman's reputation for cranking out films in less than a week, you'd think the pacing of ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" would be brisk and edgy. It is, instead, sluggish to the point of inducing slumber. There are such long pauses between lines of dialog it looks as if Corman thought the film was likely to run short.

The matte paintings are effective, but the flat lighting, typical of color films of 50 years ago, makes no effort (except at the very end) to create atmosphere. You can't frighten an audience by showing everything.

Indeed, the only really frightening element is Vincent Price's frighteningly wretched performance. Price could act well (see ""Champagne for Caesar"" and ""Dragonwyck""), but good acting partly depends on perceptive advice from the director. Given Corman's penchant for the cheaply grotesque, you can hardly expect him to be telling Price ""Underplay, Vincent! Underplay!"".

Oddly, the best thing about the film is Les Baxter's score. It is generally understated and largely free of horror-movie clich&eacute;s. The music during the climactic fight scene uses mostly low-pitched instruments, and enhances (rather than trying to compete with) the screen action.

Though ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" was (generally) critically successful at the time of its release, the decline of critical opinion is justified. It wasn't a good film then, and it's an even worse one now. What used to frighten people now induces a yawn.

He is met with lies and deceit from her surviving husband, who eventually reveals that she died of pure fright when she discovered the torture chamber lying beneath the castle's dark corridors. Francis soon finds that the hysterical Nicholas Medina was the son of the Inquisition's most notorious torturer, and that he is on the brink of insanity following his wife's demise. Corman's PIT shares much of the same brilliant scripting, superior technical form, and visual storytelling as Mario Bava's WHIP AND THE BODY. The typically modest budget is entirely concealed by its lavish sets, incredible matte paintings, and elaborate costume designs. A combination of shrouded framing and lucid color filters also give the flashbacks a haunting dream-like quality. Price hams it up in the role as only he can, but is just as enjoyable as ever as the mentally distraught Medina. PIT AND THE PENDULUM is sure to please any Gothic Horror fans, and marks one of Roger Corman's finer achievements.

1261889,5,B000038IFO,"Edgar Allen Poe would have been amazed at Richard Matheson's version of Edgar's original story about a 16th century nobleman, who meets despair, grief and insanity upon the death of his wife, or so we suppose.

One of Roger Corman's better horror films, after the success of The House of Usher.  Vincent Price starts the story in deep grief, some critics say ""whimpiness"" (not really) as he relates to the brother of Elizabeth (his wife) the goings on since her death.

At first he makes up some story about her blood being bad, but then recants and spins a tale or two about her, some thinking that the castle may be haunted.

Eventually we find that Elizabeth is alive after all, faked her death and drives Nicholas crazy a day early since she has the hots for Nicholas' best friend, the doctor.

And darn wouldn't you know it, the same thing happened to his father.  Except his father was a torturer for the Grand Inquisition.

Vincent Price is horrifically deviously delicious as a torturer who makes good use of the Iron Maiden and the Pendulum with such gleeful abandon, it's fun to watch.  I have read where the Pendulum originally was hard rubber, but they decided to go for painted STEEL.  That was some brave actor under the blade.

Corman's use of tinted frames, ocean storms, and distorted camera views makes for a fairly horrific tale.  The ""one-star wonders"" on Amazon have not a clue what true horror is, when you put Corman, Price and Matheson in the same box.

1261894,4,B000038IFO,"Success breeds excess, so following HOUSE OF USHER, AIP asked Roger Corman for a follow-up.  Some films you CAN'T do sequels to... but this never seems to stop anybody.  Now, while USHER and PIT have nothing to do with each other, if one were to, say, watch them back-to-back, based on the many story elements they DO have in common, one might mistake the 2nd film's title for HOUSE OF USHER 2 !!!

Both films have the identical opening.  A man who's traveled far has trouble getting into a big mansion, and inquires about a woman.  In the original, it was a guy wanting to see his fiance, and her brother-- who's going mad-- refuses, claiming it's for the best.  In this one, the guy inquires after his DEAD sister-- and her husband-- Price-- greets him warmly, but as things progress, his sanity slips away.

The 1st was elegant in its simplicity.  The 2nd, an ""original"" story (heh) is more ""the kitchen sink"" category.  I mean, what a GREAT flick.  This thing tries to hit ALL the bases.  Spooky castle-- dead woman-- crypt in the basement-- TORTURE CHAMBER in the basement.  There's a story about how Price's late wife became obsessed with the torture chamber, accidentally got locked in and died of fright.  Ther's another story about how as a boy, Price saw his father (an infamous member of The Inquisition) accuse HIS wife & brother of adultery, and after killing his brother, had tortured his wife TO DEATH (some house, huh?).  And then people start hearing harpsichord music in the night-- when it was the dead wife who played it all the time.  There's even a secret passageway in the walls.  It just keeps stacking up higher and higher as it goes.

It's not often a really good film that becomes successful spawns an equally good follow-up.  I'd say this was one of 'em.

This film has something in common with the 007 film, OCTOPUSSY.  Both are not really adaptations of the stories they take their names from-- but, in effect, SEQUELS to them.

Among the cast was Price's sister-- played by (I took note) Luana Anders.  I had to look it up, but she'd also been in the memorable OUTER LIMITS episode-- ""The Guests"".  Geez!!!  One of the really FREAKIN' WEIRD ones!!!  That's the one about the house inhabited by an alien from space, where time stands still and nobody ever ages... UNLESS they leave, and then time catches up, all at once.  I'd have to look it up, but I'd BET that sicko Joe Stefano wrote that one.  He did most of the REALLY whacked-out one the 1st year (he was one of the show's 3 exec. producers).

Anyway...  Unlike USHER, in PIT Price starts out on the friendly-- but shaky-- side.  Then he degenerates into sad & depressed...  UNTIL...  that scene in the dungeon when they GO TOO FAR.  As far as a ""#2"" film goes, PIT has this in common with PSYCHO II.  Wonder if the writers of THAT film thought about this one when they came up with their plot?  You have this whole mystery of ""What's going on?"" and only near the end of the film do you find out, several people have been scheming to drive the poor lead character out of his mind.  AND THEY SUCCEED-- all too well!  When Price starts smiling down in the dungeon, I found myself saying aloud, ""UH OH!!!"" several times.  And laughing.

For most of the film, it kept bugging me that the doctor and the brother looked so much alike.  It's not good to cast 2 actors in the same film who resemble each other.  But when the doctor SLIPPED and fell into the pit, suddenly this seeming liability became part of the plot (at least for me), as Price in his madness mistook the brother for the doctor-- and strapped him down on the platform!  AAAUGH!!!

And of course, wasn't it just too bad that the brother-- and Price's sister-- NEVER realized that Elisabeth WAS still alive-- and trapped in the dungeon?  ""No one will ever enter this room again.""  That was exactly the line Price said earlier in the film...!  Nasty, nasty!!

I'd rank this along with RED DEATH and LIGEIA among the top 3 of the series.",1153094400,,3981,4.495810055865922
1261895,4,B000038IFO,"Pit and the Pendulum (1961) was the 2nd of numerous successful Edgar Allan Poe inspired collaborations (the first being 1960's The Fall of the House of Usher) between writer/producer/director Roger Corman (It Conquered the World, Teenage Cave Man, The Little Shop of Horrors), writer Richard Matheson (The Incredible Shrinking Man, House of Usher, Tales of Terror), actor Vincent Price (House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler), and American International Pictures or AIP, for short.  Also appearing here along with Price is Barbara Steele (Black Sunday, Castle of Blood), John Kerr (Tea and Sympathy, South Pacific), Luana Anders (Easy Rider, The Last Detail), and Antony Carbone (A Bucket of Blood, Last Woman on Earth).

The movie, set in 16th century Spain, begins as we see a man riding in a carriage along a coast approaching a matte painting of an ominous castle.  The driver, unwilling to go all the way (isn't that always the case?), drops the man off a good distance from the matte painting...er, I mean castle, where he then has to hoof it the rest of the way.  Turns out the man is named Francis Barnard (Kerr), and he's come all the way from England to inquire about the untimely demise of his sister, Elizabeth (Steele).  Seems she married one Nicholas Medina (Price), moved into his castle, and then passed away under mysterious circumstances.  As Francis arrives at the castle, he meets Nicholas' sister Catherine (Anders), who's returned home to look after the welfare of her brother (apparently Nicholas doted on his wife, and is taking her loss particularly hard).  Soon Doctor Charles Leon (Carbone) makes the scene, and Francis learns his sister contracted some strange ailment Nicholas believes came from the `atmospheric miasma of barbarity that permeates the walls of the castle'...you see, Nicholas' father Sebastian was an inquisitor of grand proportions, so much so he had his own, private and extensive torture chamber set up within the caverns beneath the castle which saw a whole lot of action back in the day.  After some flashbacks we learn of a couple incidents that occurred during Nicholas' childhood, incidents that have affected him in such a way as to make him a little unbalanced, a situation that isn't helped by the fact that the spirit of his dead wife is now haunting him.  Things get a whole lot creepier as Nicholas decides to exhume his wife's corpse (seems she's interred in the crypts below the castle) after which some revelations are made, marking the real decent into madness as the comeuppance is dished out to all deserving, and even to some who aren't...I got to say, the last fifteen minutes alone is worth the price of admission, and that's one hell of a pendulum...

I've always felt The Fall of the House of Usher and Pit and the Pendulum to be among strongest and most accessible of the Poe based Corman films.  Price gives an excellent turn as Nicholas, a character plagued by his father's past transgressions, driven to the brink of madness by circumstances beyond his control.  Of all the aspects Price brings to these films, the one element that always seems to stand out for me is a sense of class.  Price is the star here, and it seemed the rest were very content to follow his capable lead.  My favorite bits in this film are when Price, in a dual role, is portraying Sebastian Medina, the inquisitor extraordinaire.  He's a loathsome, vindictive character and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  The inclusion of Ms. Steele, who had just come from appearing in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960), was a bit of inspirational casting, in my opinion, as while her part may not have been large, it certainly was memorable.  Few could pull off some of the facial expressions she was capable of, some of them quite frightening (I would have dreaded getting one of her wild-eyed, maniacal stares in the middle of the night).  I thought Anders and Carbone did well enough in their roles, but I felt Kerr was slightly miscast.  He's certainly a decent actor, but I never felt like he got completely into his role as some of the others...perhaps this an unfair judgment on my part as I think it would be difficult to compete against the likes of a Price or a Steele...ah well, this is was a fairly minor aspect compared to the whole.  As far as Richard Matheson's screenplay, it comes off exceptionally well.  Even if you're not familiar with the story, I think it's fairly obvious where things are going, but that didn't take anything away for me as the fun here was watching the events unfold.  I thought the overall atmosphere of the production, assisted by Les Baxter's ookie musical scoring, went a long way, although I thought the use of the fake cobwebs a bit excessive at times.  The usage of various matte paintings was obvious, but they were done well enough as not to take anything away for me.  Normally I dislike the inclusion of flashbacks, but I thought they were handled well here as various hues were incorporated dependant on the mood of the flashback (a violent flashback would feature a blood red hue, etc.).  I thought Corman's direction quite good but then it's no secret his affinity for the material.  The film may seem a little slow going in the beginning, but I didn't mind at all as it allowed for Price to display his talents, and provided for an exceptional build up (as I said earlier, the last fifteen minutes or so are definitely worth hanging around for...).  All in all this is an excellent feature, one that I think manages to capture a good deal of the mood within the original material, and just a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

The picture, presented in non-anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) looks clean and comes across well, while the Dolby Digital mono audio, available in both English and French, felt a bit off at times, coming across a little uneven at times.  Special features include a goofy original five-minute prologue segment, which I believe was used to help pad out the running time for television broadcast, an original theatrical trailer (in widescreen no less), a commentary track with Roger Corman, and French and Spanish subtitles.  While this film was originally released onto DVD by itself, it was re-released later onto DVD as a double feature with The Fall of the House of Usher, so if you're interesting in purchasing this film, I'd recommend searching out the double feature as you may get a better value.

At his brother-in-law's castle, perched upon the Mediterranean, his welcome is tentative.  His brother-in-law is evasive, and his brother-in-law's sister is protective--and beautiful.

And he glimpses a vile world:  A torture chamber.  A secret passageway.  A pedigree of sadism.  A suspicion of premature burial.  A suspicion of adultery.

Walk beside Vincent Price as he grapples with crippling grief, then crippling guilt, then all-out madness.  Run from Vincent Price as he assumes the identity of his father, an inquisitor, and he laughs whilst strapping an innocent man to the table beneath the patient pendulum.

See the mummified corpse of a woman screaming for escape.  Hear a harpsichord in the dead of night.  Look upon the bed of a dead wife--left just as it was on her last day of life.

Feel the chills clawing up your spine.

1261968,4,B000038IFO,"This was the second Egdar Allan Poe story to be directed by Roger Corman with Vincent Price in the leading role ,and ,as ever,the director id indebted to his star for the quality of his performance and magnetism of his personality in helping make it a quality little movie.

Price is "" Nicholas Medina "" owner of a large and spooky castle in sixteenth century Spain ,which comes complete with its very own well equipped torture chamber ,courtesy of his late father ,a torturer with the Spanish Inquisition and a man who relished his work  .(Price gets to play his father ,in one of the several flashback scenes ,and eploys a limp and a minor facial deformity to good effect in doing so )

He is in the depths of despair at the death of his young and beautiful wife ,Elizabeth and obsessed with the notion that he may have interred her alive ,just as his father did to his mother on discovering her adultery .In vain do his family doctor(Anthony Carbone)and daughter ,Catherine (Luana Anders) seek to ease his mind on that score .

Elizabeths' brother Francis (John Kerr) travels to the castle determined to get to the bottom of his sister's death .Sopon the residents and servants begin to hear strange noises -a harpsichord which only Elizabeth could play -and a maid claims Elizabeth spoke to her .Medina feels his grip on reality loosen ,a situation not helped when they open her tomb to see what appears evidence of premature burial .

Then  screenwriter and adaptor Richard Matheson pulls out a neat double reverse twist ending as Price spirals into outright madness .

Price is wonderful -arch ,camp and knowing he revels in the flowery dialogue and chews the scenery with elegance and wit .Its a bravura performance and he is well matched by Barbara Steele as Elizabeth -more a presence than an acting talent ,she gives a compekking account of herself .The rest of the players are capable but dull by comparison .

Fluid and inventive camerawork by Floyd Crosby helps as does the splendid art direction by Daniel Haller who creates a memorable castle on very little money-cobweb festooned and with torches and castles flickerinfg sinisterly in their sconces

The climax is effective and my only real reservation is the way flashbacks dissipate tension slightly .This is a minor quibble and the movie is atisfying and stylishly done with a great star turn as the icing on the cake .

Enjoyable movie and well recommended",1120867200,4,2426,4.768496420047732
1261969,4,B000038IFO,"Perhaps the quintessential Poe film, ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" still holds up well and still belies its small budget, thanks to great art direction and design by Daniel Haller, great photogrpahy by Floyd Crosby, and great direction by Roger Corman.  It also shows the standard weaknesses of the early Poe films, including a Richard Matheson script containing some of the worst, jaw-fracturing dialogue this side of Ed Wood Jr., and a supporting cast of young -- too young -- Corman regulars who aren't quite up to the period challenge, and who can't always hold their own against star Vincent Price.  The AIP Poe films frequently resemble college productions in which the star is an established guest artist, but none so much as ""Pit.""  Only Anthony Carbone manages to handle the situations and dialogue with suitable aplomb, though, oddly, he, nominal hero John Kerr and Patrick Westwood as a prop servant, all look so much alike in coloration, costume and even hairstyles, that in long shot it is sometimes difficult to tell which is which.  The age problem is most notable when Carbone, as Price's best friend, and Luana Anders, as Price's sister, begin describing what happened to Price as a little boy as if they were there as eye-witnesses, when they could not have been.

Barbara Steele is elegant, but underused.  And as for John Kerr, it is fitting that his opening scenes are filmed against the ocean, since he is totally at sea for the rest of the film.  All he brings to his scenes with Price is height.  Which brings us to Price himself.  His performance in this film is the turn that both cemented his reputation as a horrormeister and also created the unfortunate designation of ""ham.""  The latter is not entirely fair, since Price manages to walk the fine line between the kind of full-blooded performance that is required to sell the character and going totally over the top.  But he comes awfully close to the edge.  In truth, this is probably Price's barest, most emotional performance, and he is only let down by Corman's decision to film his craziest moments in closeup.

But ""Pit's"" flaws are offset by one of Corman's all-time best sequences, one that has been aped countless times since, but never equalled:  the chilling, dreamlike subterranean chase wherein Price's dead wife rises from the crypt and stalks him through the castle dungeons.  That sequence is enough to forgive anything else -- including the fact that a corpse in the crypt that features in one of the film's big shock moments is never identified.

Above all, though, ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" is a film that must be seen in its original aspect ratio, even on television.  Pan-and-scan severely damages the effect.",1120003200,3,2708,4.852173913043479

The climactic scene in the ""Pit"" is simply astonishing. One of the best scenes in any horror film ever made!

Elizabeth's brother Francis comes to the castle seeking information on his sister's death and the terror begins as the ghost of Elizabeth seems to be roaming around causing Nicolas to feel he buried her prematurely. Flashbacks explain Elizabeth's weird ""death"" and Nicolas's own childhood trauma witnessing his insane father (also Price) torture his mother and wall her up alive in the torture chamber. But Elizabeth is anything but dead and Nicolas goes over the edge becoming his own father in madness and putting the dreaded Pendulum kept in the Pit to use...with Francis as his victim. Elizabeth gets her own just rewards in the torture chamber. Beautiful Gothic mounting, costumes and a tight script by Richard Matheson keep this completely watchable throughout. Good acting from Steele, John Kerr as Francis and Luana Anders (""Dementia 13"") as Dona Catherine Medina--Nicolas's worried sister, and Corman regular Antony Carbone as the evil Dr. Leon. But it's Price who keeps things humming---going mad scene by scene until he's full blown insane and working the Pendulum on poor Kerr. Excellent moody music score from Les Baxter, too.

1262051,5,B000038IFO,"This brilliant horror classic brought together the talents of a remarkable cast of actors in a memorable tale of madness, murder, torture, and revenge in 16th century Spain.
Vincent Price plays Nicholas Medina, an aristocrat suffering the recent loss of his beloved wife Elizabeth. John Kerr plays Elizabeth's brother Francis Barnard, and Luana Anders shines as Medina's gentle sister Catherine. Rounding out the cast is Anthony Carbone as Medina's treacherous physician Dr. Leon and Barbara Steele as Medina's adulterous wife Elizabeth.
The story in brief: Barnard arrives unbidden at Medina's lonely castle to investigate his sister Elizabeth's sudden death. He is welcomed with some hesitation by Elizabeth's widower Nicholas Medina and his sister Catherine. The youth receives confusing accounts of his sister's death from Medina as well as from the family physician Dr. Leon and resolves to remain until his questions are satisfied.
Spookery through the night and the next morning suggest Elizabeth's spirit walks the corridors of the castle. With great anguish, Medina decides to open Elizabeth's tomb; a rotting corpse is discovered and it is then Medina's greatest fear is realized -- Elizabeth was buried alive and died in suffocating agony. Medina stoically resigns himself to awaiting his wife's vengeance from the grave.
Elizabeth did not die however. She is alive and scheming with her lover Dr. Leon to rid herself of Medina once and for all. In the dead of night, she lures Medina to a long neglected torture chamber in the bowels of the castle with the intention of delivering her coup de grace. The sorry, half-crazed Medina there learns the truth of his wife's adultery, and, mustering an uncanny strength in his madness, turns the tables to ruthlessly serve the miscreants their just deserts. Medina then tortures the innocent Barnard with a razor sharp pendulum before being slain by his manservant. Having survived the maelstrom, Barnard and Catherine depart arm-in-arm.
Vincent Price plays the tragic Nicholas Medina to the hilt: his soul-in-torment arias are braced with pain-filled grimaces and his scenes in the torture chamber are thick with a subtle eroticism. At film's end the viewer is saddened that this gentle, cultivated, aristocratic, and too-trusting man suffers madness and death.
Blues dominate the film's palette and the musical score by Les Baxter - especially the 'Elizabeth' motif - is effective.
The film is a celebrated horror classic and the viewer will not be disappointed.",1030406400,7,2518,5.31328320802005

I think this is one of the first examples of a villain whose villainy gets its start from a childhood trauma, and we see his slow descent into madness and murder during the movie.  Price's emotions are on display and they hypnotize, but the restrained performance of the actress who plays his sister is a perfect foil.  It is as if the evil, the veniality and the sadism that she saw in her youth has taught her never to display any emotion at all, lest her own terror and anguish come to the surface.  She is as passive and placid as Price's character is tortured and overwrought.  The dialogue is sometimes banal and silly, and there are some anachronisms in the sets and in the actor's behaviors, but otherwise it's a classic tale of terror- doesn't follow the Edgar Allen Poe story, but is a worthy tribute to the man who created ""The Raven"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart.""",1025136000,,1177,4.523584905660377

Vincent Price is a Spanish nobleman haunted by the sins of his Inquisitor father.  While a small boy, Price accidentally witnessed his sadistic sire murder his uncle and wall-up his mother alive, believing them to have committed adultery together.  His greatest fear, since that day, has been that his evil father's genes will somehow evidence themselves in him.  Now an adult, the gentle Price discovers he has accidentally buried loving wife Barbara Steele while still alive, and is near suicidal with grief.  But his suffering has only begun.  His wife's spirit seems to be coming after him  -  or is it something worse?
Vincent Price and Barbara Steele never turned in better performances.  Before the story is done, each of them get to play both victim and vengeful ghost  -  which can't be explained without ruining the sinisterly splendid plot, penned by veteran horror screenwriter Richard Matheson.  The imagery is hauntingly grotesque, the atmosphere and mood often unbearably intense.  Price has a mad scene that is simply unforgettable.
The movie gets off to a slow start, but once it kicks into high gear, it grabs you by the vitals and won't let go.  Young hero John Kerr is a bit wooden, but performs capably enough to further the frightening plot.  The always wonderful Luana Anders plays Price's sister, who gets to narrate the tale  -  with stylishly done flashbacks  -  of her and Price's evil progenitor.  The sets are gorgeous.  The soundtrack is especially effective, a combination of low, lengthy bass notes and frenetic, atonal percussion.

1262113,5,B000038IFO,"The Medina family has a lot of skeletons in the family closet. And the torture chamber. And the crypt. In Roger Corman's adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's classic ""The Pit and the Pendulum"", we even get to see some of them. There is a vague, sketchy storyline to Poe's nightmarish tale, making it next to impossible to translate into a feature length film. Corman, the low-budget wunderkind of American International Pictures, along with screenwriter Richard Matheson, made a memorable filmic adaptation of the Poe story. The setting is 1540s Spain, where Englishman Francis Barnard has traveled to investigate the sudden, mysterious death of his sister Elizabeth. Elizabeth, wife of Nicholas Medina, son of a brutal grand inquisitor, has died of fright. Her grief-stricken, guilt-ridden husband fears that she has been interred prematurely. He has good reason, too. As a boy, Nicholas witnessed his father kill his uncle, then wall up his mother alive. And that's only part of the story! The film has its mysterious goings-on and recriminations, and builds to a heart-pounding climax featuring the title device. And there is a final, ironic twist to the film which I won't divulge to new viewers. Screen Matheson incorporated all of those feel-good Poe elements, i.e. madness, guilt, revenge, torture, premature burial, and of course, the title device, into the film. Corman's direction, along with Floyd Crosby's photography and Daniel Haller's art direction, make the film visually memorable and sumptuous, which is something of a miracle, due to budget-conscious American International. The matte paintings of the Medina castle and the ""Pit and the Pendulum"" are images wrenched out of a nightmare. The Renaissance costumes are handsome (altho the women's hairdos and makeup date the film), and Les Baxter's vivid score adds a great deal to the drama. Baxter's ""love theme"" takes on a very ironic meaning in the end credits. And now for the cast. Vincent Price gives a wonderful, over-the-top performance as Nicholas and his father Sebastian in an hallucinatory flashback. His Nicholas is classic Poe, a man living on the very edge of sanity. Some critics describe Mr. Price as hammy, but with such baroque, larger-than-life material, I don't think the ""mumble"" school of acting would exactly fit the bill. John Kerr is sulkily appealing as Francis, and the late, underrated Luana Anders and Paul Simon lookalike Antony Carbone lend good support as Nicholas' sister and best friend. And, of course, there is the strikingly beautiful Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. The tall, slender British brunette with the high cheekbones, pouty lower lip and large hazel-green eyes has been described by one fan as ""horror chic personified"", and ""the illegitimate daughter of Christopher Lee and Cyd Charisse"" by another. The talented Ms. Steele scored a hit in the Mario Bava classic ""Black Sunday"", and became one of the screen's most famous ""Scream Queens"", appearing in several European horror films, as well as several non-horror films. Her screen time in ""Pit"" is brief but unforgettable. Even when she is offscreen, she is spoken of, referred to, and you find yourself thinking, ""When will we see her again?"" Inexplicably, Ms. Steele's voice was dubbed in this film.
The picture quality on the DVD is superb. I have seen this film innumerable times, and seeing it in DVD format was like seeing it for the first time. The colors are rich, and the detail is razor-sharp (couldn't resist!) The sound is okay, not spectacular. There is also the rarely-seen prologue, which was filmed years after the film was made for its television airing in the late 1960s. It neither adds nor detracts from the film, but it is an interesting curio nonetheless. ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" is my favorite of ther Corman/Poe adaptations. Now, when are ""The Masque of the Red Death"", ""The Haunted Palace"", and ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" going to be released?

I would have given it 5 stars were it not for the letterbox issue and the lack of booklet/card and some more substantial extras that a film of this significance deserves.  Sets are wonderfully done, with some good castle exterior shots (even though we know they're only paintings).

1262115,3,B000038IFO,"... so why did I buy this one?
Because I still had very vivid memories of the film's climactic scenes from watching it as a young child in a hotel room; the man chained down as a massive axe swings back and forth and starts cutting into his stomach, the twsited man in black pulling the chain to lower it further... aaaiiiiieeee!
The last 15 or so minutes of the film match my youthful experiences, even through the jaded eyes of an adult who's watched waaaay too many B-movies. What's more, this is probably the BEST Corman film I've been exposed too. And the final shot of the film is very creepy!
Price's performance is fabulous here; the slide into madness of his character is actually believable, as is the terror on his face. The supporting cast also does a great job, although Barbara Shelley isn't used to her fullest because they've redubbed an American actress over her. (I supposed someone said, ""Gee.. her BROTHER sounds American, so she should too."") The sets and camera work, even the musical score also stand head and shoulders above other Corman films I've seen.
The three stars are, partly, because the film does show some of the usual Corman defects--pan shots that I imagine are supposed to be suspenseful but are just boring and lame exchanges between actors stating the obvious, but also because the video seems to have been taken from a flawed print; the color is off in a number of scenes.",1015200000,,1412,4.629482071713148

It combines elements of a love betrayed, a love born, revenge, madness and fear into a story loosely based on Poe. Price's sense of Gothic surrealism and horror carries the movie.

Released in 1961 ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" stars Price as Nicholas Medina, the 16th century son of a notorious Spanish Inquisition torturer. His descent into madness is played out against multi-colored flashbacks and lush gothic castle settings. Co-starring is the exotic English actress Barbara Steele, fresh from her Italian triumph, ""Black Sunday"". ""The Pit"" improves on ""House of Usher"" in nearly every respect.

1262120,5,B000038IFO,"I just about fell over backwards when I bought my copy of this DVD.  As part of the special features, it includes an audio commentary by Roger Corman!
MGM Midnight Movies keep coming out, and my collection keeps growing.  When I think of Vincent Price and Roger Corman, this gem is the movie that comes to mind.  It is the perfect late-night horror film.  If you've seen this movie on VHS, you know what I mean, but you're not getting the whole thing until you get this widescreen DVD.
The quality of the film it perfect.  I saw no noticable wear of picture quality.  The sound it fantastic.  Vincent Price's perfomance as the tortured and soon demented son of a mad Spanish Inquisitioner is perfectly played out.  The lonely castle setting is pure gothic.  The interiors of castle give the feeling of wondering in a huge and rambling castle.  Barbara Steele is pefectly wicked and sexy. The love story between the hero and heroine never really developes, but who cares!  We want to see Vincent go mad and take his revenge.
After I watched the film, I watched it again with the audio commentary turned on.  It was fun hearing Roger Corman explain some of his movie tricks for giving depth and beauty to one of his low-budget masterpieces.  Normally, the MGM Midnight Movie films only include scene access and the theatrical preview as the extras, so this was a fantastic extra for no extra cost!
Keep 'em coming MGM.  You put them in the store, I'll put them in my collection!",1005955200,16,1476,4.583969465648855
1262121,4,B000038IFO,For all Vincent Price fans or horror fans. No one does Poe like Price. Good cast and plot. Also would recommend Fall of the House of Usher. Also starring Price in a Poe tale. Good scary movie/old time style. Enjoy Lisa C.,1003795200,3,221,4.285714285714286
1262173,4,B000038IFO,"Somewhat flat acting by everyone except Mr. Price (who is quite entertaining, if a bit over the top) is redeemed by terrific sets and subtle, effective direction by Mr. Corman.  The widescreen transfer of the very good source print is crisp and bright, with wonderful colors.  Mr. Matheson's story goes off in its own direction from the Poe original, but it nevertheless preserves many of the troubled author's beloved themes, and is involving and entertaining in a ""literate comic book"" type of way.  A wonderful commentary track by Mr. Corman (who always has lots of great stories and inside info in his DVD commentaries) and a nice selection of genre trailers make this inexpensive DVD a great bargain.

I loved this film as a teenager - years later the overall effect is rather that of a High School production. Overacting (or lack of), lame dialog and kiddie birthday magician tricks make this one appear as a cheap cash-in to the successful predecessor ""House of Usher"" - which it probably is. The picture and sound quality is also inferior compared to the recently released ""House of Usher""-DVD. They should have released ""Tomb of Ligeia"" or ""Not of this Earth"" instead (just to name two good and hard to find Roger Corman efforts).",998438400,,735,4.661538461538462
1262175,5,B000038IFO,"While viewing this sumptuous new widescreen transfer of a well remembered classic, I realized that I was seeing the true film for the first time. Every corner of the screen is utilized here and a full appreciation of the story and the atmosphere created can't be had in any other format. Price's seemingly over-the-top performance comes into much sharper focus when he is allowed the full range of the anamorphic screen to emote in. As with the previously released HOUSE OF USHER, director Corman's commentary is both informative and intoxicating, as if he want's to pull you deeper into the horror with his tradmark sonorous voice. This is a beautifully crafted film which can now be appreciated on many new levels. Highly recommended!",994291200,,736,4.991869918699187

1262177,5,B000038IFO,"I saw this film at the drive-in ""back in the day"" and it scared me so bad it was one of the most harrowing events of my young life. Watching it last night as a more sophisticated, worldy adult it did not scare me; however, I did enjoy it very much. Vincent Price give an over the top performance as a madman who gleefully tortures his victems. The torture chamber and castle have an errie beauty, and the story builds to a really suspenseful climax. The widescreen presentation is clear and the colors a vidid; the sound quality is excellent; and the price is right. This is one in a series by Midnight Marquee which are releasing lots of great movies that horror buffs of my generation enjoyed.

1262178,4,B000038IFO,"This film and HOUSE OF USHER can be seen on TV fairly often, so why buy the DVD?  There are a few good reasons to buy it.  (1) The film is presented in its original ""widescreen"" format, in almost pristine ""full color""; (2) the DVD comes with a rare extra -- the ""original theatrical prologue,"" about 5 minutes of preliminary shock-stuff before the opening title sequence -- which is a revelation to those of us who know the Corman/Poe films primarily from TV; and (3) the producer/director Roger Corman provides running commentary through the whole film, which is both entertaining and informative.  Corman passes along some of his general film theories and also some history about the various actors and scenes in the film.  Personally I find (3) the best aspect of the DVD.  Consider also:  (4) at approximately $12, this is truly a bargain DVD  -- so if you've never seen the film, this isn't a risky proposition.  It's a lot of fun, and the final 10 minutes are classic Gothic horror.  Go for it!",992131200,2,1000,4.636363636363637

They suceed, and it doesnt look too good for the adulterous couple. Steele ends up buried alive(Ironically) her lover plunges to his death over a wall, and Steeles brother, played by John Kerr, ends up on the recieving end of the Pendulem. Thus the name.

1262180,5,B000038IFO,"After the success of ""House of Usher,"" American International asked director Roger Corman to ""adapt"" another Edgar Allen Poe work to the screen.  ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" seemed the logical choice, although the story itself is essentially unfilmable.  Fortunately, screenwriter Richard Matheson (who did some of his best work for Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"") simply reused the ""House of Usher"" story line and tacked on ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" as the climatic scene.  As long as Vincent Price was engaged in his celebrated over the top performance as Nicholas Medina, neither horror fans nor American lit majors were going to notice in this 1961 film.
The film is set in 16th century Spain as young Francis Barnard (John Kerr) arrives at the castle of Don Nicholas Medina (Price) to investigate the death of his sister, Elizabeth (Barbara Steele), the Don's wife.  But all Francis gets from Nicholas is a...story about Elizabeth dying from ""something in her blood.""  The young man investigates further and discovers that Nicholas had driven Elizabeth over the edge.  It seems that Nicholas's father Sebastian was a leader of the Spanish Inquisition, had killed hundreds of people in the castle's crypts and had caught his wife in adultery with his brother.  Young Nicholas watched his father bury his mother alive in a wall (sound familiar Poe fans?) and ended up scarred for life (you think?).  Meanwhile, Nicholas is being haunted by ghostly going ons and becomes convinced he has buried his wife alive and she has returned to haunt him.  When Elizabeth apparently rises from her tomb to confront him, Nicholas's mind snaps and he is driven into a homicidal dementia, which ends up with Francis being confronted with the title's instrument of torture as the film makes its way to the requisite
""The Pit and the Pendulum"" improves slightly on the first film in the AIP Poe series.  Certainly the visual elements by art director Daniel Haller are a vast improvement, from the eighteen-foot long one-ton pendulum to Medina's castle for which Haller gutted an entire soundstage and dressed all the way up to the roof to great effect.  The Freudian implications beloved by Corman have to do with Nicholas's feelings for his mother instead of the brother-sister vibes we get in ""House of Usher.""  Price is gloriously over the top but John Kerr does nothing with his role as Francis and for some reason Barbara Steele's performance is marred by the fact her voice has been redubbed.  For me, what makes ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" memorable is the unforgettable final [scenes].  Irony can be both just and horrible at the same time.",989366400,18,2632,4.952272727272727
1262181,4,B000038IFO,"Vincent Price portrays Nicholas Medina, a man tormented and haunted not only by his beloved wife's recent death but also because his father Sebastian operated a torture chamber and murdered Nicholas' mother.  His brother-in-law Francis Barnard (John Kerr) comes to the forboding Medina castle to investigate his sister Elizabeth's death only to experience mysterious ""happenings"", which seem to suggest that Elizabeth might be alive after all.  Vincent Price hams it up wonderfully, and the incredibly spooky atmosphere makes things pretty creepy as well.  Hang in there during the first slow half, the second half makes it all worthwhile and Mr. Price swings a mean pendulum.",985305600,3,676,5.419047619047619

I tend to enjoy his sci-fi movies more. And, there are older and newer horror films I like more, but that is a personal preference for style, storytelling or star. However, without Corman's B-movies of the 50s, a lot of those later films would never have been made. So this was a fun night's entertainment.
