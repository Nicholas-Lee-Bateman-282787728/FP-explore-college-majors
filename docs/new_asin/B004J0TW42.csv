8431481,5,B004J0TW42,"Tori black is amazing in this film. She is probably one of the hottest porn stars out there right now, and knows how to make a guy spout up like a geyser.",1392854400,,154,3.84375
8431482,1,B004J0TW42,"Most of the movie was a dialog with Tori and her client. Why????? One bed scene and the wolf shows up. Terrible waste of time. Love Tori, won't see this one ever again!!",1362614400,3,169,4.151515151515151
8431483,1,B004J0TW42,"You would think that with this day and age even a low budget movie could have some sort of appeal. no idea what this other guy was smoking to comment it as 5 stars. it isn't even a one star movie to me. its so low budget I could do better with my jvc home cam and my computer software. maybe I should get into this business. I enjoy tori black alot, I prefer her earlier work though. as she gets older, she makes me loose interest. like she thinks she doesnt have to try as hard anymore because shes a famous porn star. I absolutely loved a seen with her and lexie belle in a different film where she played a lesbian girl told to ""train"" a shy virgin lexie belle by her aunts command to satisfy someone sexually. and it was good acting skills on her part. it was her earlier work. and of course this ""half moon"" movie was nowhere near a porn movie, it only showed her bare top and thats it. one sex seen and a dead topless girl in beginning of movie.  (......yawn)  more dialougue than any other movie I own. and no action or entertainment at all till their extreamily quick topless sex scene, and the guy only becomes a wearwolf at the last 10 minutes or so of the movie. and trust me no channel such as chill, or sci-fi, or any other would dare put this crap on at any time slot. Ive seen some really crappy movies in my lifetime. but this one is so bad it leaves you wanting to only watch it to help you get to sleep. oh and another final note. if cute white girls but talking like a southern valley girl speaking with the urban street hood lingos doesnt interest you either, don't watch it for that reason alone, cause there is so much dialogue with her talking like this, I was about pull out my eyelashes, cause watching this movie I ended up pulling out all my head hair and eyebrows. forcing to give it a chance.....hoping that it gets better.....but sadly it dont.",1307750400,6,1874,4.2027777777777775
8431484,5,B004J0TW42,"I bought this movie because I hope if Tee Reel makes enough money, he will stop doing scenes with Tori Black. I always feel icky when watching them, like it's my nephew making out with his babysitter.  The way I found out about this movie was searching on the Internet (both IAFD and then IMDB) for a reason why Tori Black is always doing scenes with this dude... I thought ""either they (the directors) are only paying him in hamburgers per scene, or he is really making it rain on her!"" Well anyway, the movie is standard fare, strictly Sci-fi channel late night quality. Everybody did their own makeup and wore their own clothes obviously - check out the pimp's knuckles! Some of the lines (as usual, in these types of movies) were quite funny and made me laugh. Thanks for reading.",1303948800,5,784,4.52112676056338
