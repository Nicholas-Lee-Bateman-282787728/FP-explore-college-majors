4007493,5,B002WNUVJS,"In the first decade of the 21st century, Marvel's had big success in comics, on film, and in animated television programs; the one area where they have really lagged behind DC has been in the animated DVD market, where Bruce Timm's productions have been more numerous and generally more successful.  The recent ""Hulk vs."" DVD was a step in the right direction, providing some great action and good use of Marvel characters, albeit in two shortened segments that neither of them possessed a full story.  ""Planet Hulk"", an adaptation of the Marvel Comics storyline of the same name by Greg Pak (who is involved in the production), is a full-length story, and it is by far the best thing Marvel Animation's DVD program has done, and ranks with my favourite DC DVDs.  Again starring the Hulk, but this time way out of his normal element, it delivers action and heart.  Some spoilers follow.

We're dropped right into the story, as the Hulk (voice of Rick Wasserman) awakens to find himself traveling through space, with a video from the Illuminati (Iron Man [Marc Worden, reprising his role from various other Marvel DVDs], Mr. Fantastic, Dr. Strange, and Black Bolt) explaining that his constant destructive rampages have forced them to send him away to a peaceful world where he can at last be left alone.  Nice idea, but the Hulk doesn't take this well, and destroys the instrumentation, sending the ship careening into a wormhole and crashlanding on the planet Sakaar.  Captured and forced to fight in gladiator games for the entertainment of the despotic Red King (Mark Hildreth), he finds himself the unwilling companion of the Warbound, a collection of fellow-gladiators.  Many come to see the Hulk as the Sakaarson, the saviour of the planet, but others, including the Red King's lieutenant Caiera (Lisa Beley), insist that the King himself fulfills that role.  And the Hulk himself doesn't have a lot of interest in it...

If it sounds a bit like the movie ""Gladiator"", it is.  But it's ""Gladiator"" with the action quotient increased to eleven.  The story is a fairly faithful condensation of the original epic (which ran for over a year in the comics), with a few character roles and plot elements shifted around.  Most notably, for those who have read the original, Beta Ray Bill has been substituted for the Silver Surfer, which works extremely well, and is a tremendous little depiction of the character.  The voice actors all do a good job with their parts, including Wasserman as the Hulk, who is far more talkative here than general audiences will be used to (in the comics, he's been typically sentient since the 1980s).  And for those who like their cartoons a bit bloodier than they'll show on Saturday morning, this is your story.  There are some truly brutal action scenes here, and the Spikes are depicted like creatures from a horror movie.

Fans of the comic will also be familiar with the followup story, ""World War Hulk"", which the end of ""Planet Hulk"" leads into.  As I had suspected prior to watching, the DVD stops just short of the comics ending, wisely not presuming that there will be a followup DVD; Pak has spoken of plans for one in the near-future, where the sad fate of Sakaar can be played out in the opening sequence.  After this excellent film, it will be a truly sorrowful thing to see.

4007495,5,B002WNUVJS,"As all of you fans of the Hulk know, this is the animated adaptation of the popular comic book series. Now, I would like to begin, that they made a lot of changes in this adaptation. Some are good, while others I don't care for, but this is still a great animated action film. The demise of the Red King is something that I like better here than in the comics.

Sadly, just to inform you, the Silver Surfer has been replaced by Beta Ray Bill!!! But don't blame Marvel, blame FOX STUDIOS!!! One thing this movie has though is a lot of action and a fast paced storyline. It is without a doubt the best Marvel animated film so far. It keeps a similar theme to its comic counterpart, and it still keeps the viewers entertained.

The voice cast is just great, and they suit each others characters perfectly. While I must admit, I still prefer the comic over the animated film. I'm a big Hulk fan, and the way I look at it, if it isn't broke, don't try fixing it. I just wished they would have made it exactly like the comic, but I'm not complaining, for I really like this film.

What intrests me is if there is a World War Hulk, his wife Caiera may be coming along for the ride! I would love to see a WWH animated film! Just to see Stark, Richards, and all of the Marvel Universe being beaten almost to death!!! It gives a whole new meaning to the words... HULK SMASH!!!!

While I did not care for the changes they have made to this animated adaptation, it didn't ruin it for me. The story is fresh and the action is some of the best I have ever witnessed in animation. Some fans will dislike the change (well more like they will hate it), others fan or non fans will be sure to enjoy this great animated film.

My advice, buy this film. It's a good adaptation, and it is sure to please those who like great fights and a good story. It's worth the price of $17.49, and you will not be displeased. While it may not be as spectacular as its comic book counterpart, it is still great in its own way.",1264032000,37,3185,4.265339966832504
4007506,5,B002WNUVJS,"One of my favorite Hulk stories from the comic books, and it is well adapted to the animated screen.  A few changes here and there but still worth watching.  For me it is to bad that they haven't gotten to the back side of this story yet with the return of the Hulk and his war bound.  I feel that story should be seen as well in this style.  Also nice to see is the adaption or rather part of this adaption into the big screen with the new movie Thor: Ragnorak.",1513036800,,462,3.989130434782609
4007507,5,B002WNUVJS,"I was not expecting people to be killed. Usually cartoons are *oh he fainted*. Not this cartoon. Was worth the watch.

My only beef is that I wish the Hulk had a progression of angry. By that I mean the way they drew his face and how the events personally affected him. They just relied on ""hulk smash"".  But still it was awesome.

4007890,4,B002WNUVJS,"I am a life long fan of the Incredible Hulk comic books, so when I started running out of downloadable Prime movies for my train ride home, I decided to give Planet Hulk a chance. I'm glad I did.

The story is like a Hulkified version of Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The Hulk get's banished to outer space and crash lands on a planet oppressed by the Red King. He immediately is captured (?!) and forced to fight alongside other alien races in a Coliseum for his freedom. He eventually befriends this rag tag group of aliens and fights alongside them against an ever more difficult group of foes. One of my favorite story threads involves Beta Ray Bill.

The animation is Saturday morning cartoon quality. You will not be marveling (get it, Marvel?) at the beautiful backdrops or stunning special effects. The animation serves the story, but just barely.

If you are a fan of the Hulk and can look past some low production values, you should give Planet Hulk a look. It kept me interested long enough in the story to make it to its conclusion.",1447200000,4,1040,4.550802139037433

This is a world that exists on its own. I could see this happening in any of the current story worlds; so it slips in seamlessly. Hulk at the beginning is portrayed as an unthinking brute, but as you watch you come to realize he is a simple character betrayed by all and trying to avoid more pain. This movie is short and yet manages character development in both main and secondary characters. I would not call any character necessarily lovable but likable, respectable, and understandable yes. And of course the villain is a wussy ass you just love to see get completely fair(not necessarily nice) justice. A well done film.",1442448000,,882,4.5886075949367084

4007938,4,B002WNUVJS,"Originally written 9-29-11

The Hulk is trapped in a space shuttle and shot off into space. The Illuminati, which is made up of a small band of superheroes consisting of Mr. Fantastic, Black Bolt, Ironman, and Dr. Strange, decide that the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth. They pick out a planet with no intelligent life with vegetation and livestock, and hope he can finally live in peace. The shuttle instead goes through a wormhole and he ends up on a violent planet called Sakaar, which is ran by a tyrannical monarch named the Red King. The Hulk is soon defeated and sold into slavery. -summary

I have to be honest and admit that I actually had high hopes for this adaptation of the Planet Hulk storyline, which is based on the graphic novel written by Greg Pak. For quite some time now, many comic book to animated movies have surprised me with their faithfulness to the original source material. I know it's impossible to cram so much into a short feature, and when this occurs usually something is lost and it's almost always character and story development. Surprisingly, Planet Hulk released in 2010 and directed by Sam Liu doesn't lose much to a crippling degree if you read the book, and if you didn't read the book, there's still more than enough information provided to make the movie enjoyable. Further more, the brutal action scenes can also appeal to those searching solely for that.

Sam Liu continues to impress me, and I enjoyed his earlier works Superman/Batman: Public Enemies and Hulk vs. movie. Planet Hulk was a very complex story that could have easily been made into a 13 episode series. I commend Liu for being able to condense the story into movie length and still get the main point across. Even though this is a Hulk movie and he's always smashing things, he's still very well developed at the very least into more than a destructive brute, and the movie doesn't come off as a mere beat'em up.

The Hulk's pain can be felt and he goes through a journey trying to find himself, but this is one battle he can never win alone and this is where the side characters all come into play. Hulk is very reluctant on trusting anyone, since the very ones he trusted are responsible for shooting him into space. Those whom are around do get to know him, and I enjoyed how this was implemented into the storyline,as well as its conclusion. Hulk realizes that he is a monster, however he also learns that he is a hero, and he finds this new role hard to embrace. He's finally being accepted and there are those that look up to him for leadership, strength, and courage. Sam Liu did a wonderful job maintaining the very essence of what made Planet Hulk into the great story that it was.

For the comic purist out there, yes, there were changes made and the character development in regards to the Warbound is not completely intact, as well as other story elements being completely changed. I didn't have a problem with it, since several other things were worked out well. I recommend coming into this with an opened mind and completely ignoring the book.

The animation flows very well during the battle segments and there are several. They are very brutal with some deaths here and there with lots of weapon and fist play. The backgrounds also capture that feel of the book and some moments tell the tale of the world. The only problem I had was in the character designs. For some reason, I just can't get into Marvel's animated art style. It just has this rather bland appeal to me.

Overall, Plant Hulk surprised me and I find it to be one of the better Marvel movies. Now as a fan of the Planet Hulk storyline, I think Sam Liu did a very good job bringing it to animation. I think most fans will get into it, casual fans will also enjoy it. However, I kind of think the violence isn't quite appropriate for young children. There's quite a bit of onscreen death and blood. So I think parents should be aware of this. The movie is 81 minutes.

Pros: Newbie friendly, maintains essence of the book, action, and animation

Cons: Didn't care for character designs",1428796800,,4087,4.5572207084468666

4007942,3,B002WNUVJS,"An ancient prophecy. An exiled hero. One battle after another.

Hulk has been banished into space by the Illuminati. The reason? Hes simply too dangerous, too powerful and too unpredictable. Upon landing on the planet Sakaar, Hulk is taken captive and is forced to compete as a gladiator for the peoples entertainment. With no choice but to fight, Hulk must battle his way free, and not only for himself, but for an entire kingdom under the rule of an unpleasant emperor. Is Hulk the one foretold to come to usher in an era of peace?

I don't know, man. This flick wasn't really my thing, to be honest. It was a kind of Star Wars meets superhero thing that, while kind of interesting, didn't really thrill me as a superhero fan.

But first, the pluses:

Loads of action. Hulk is fighting people pretty much all the time in this movie, and not only simply fighting them, but having to struggle against those nearly as powerful as himself. You don't often see him doing that.

The sci-fi aspect was different and by having the story not take place on Earth, you got to see something that isn't presented all too often in superhero flicks and/or cartoons.

The minuses (for me):

Hulk was the smart Hulk in this movie. Not the genius-level one, but he formed complete sentences, had genuine feelings, and wasn't a big ball of rage like in Hulk vs. Im a fan of the latter. I like the Hulk-smash Hulk. Not quite stupid, but certainly simple-minded, and an all-out force of meta-nature. Seeing him pretty much be a big green human wasn't really my thing. I know others like that version of Hulk, which is fine, but I like the other one better.

The pacing was slow as well, with flashbacks that seemed to bog it down versus add to it. I know why they had them, but they didn't really add to the tale and those scenes couldve been simply mentioned versus shown.

Arts subjective, but the cartooning style of this flick wasn't up my alley. Whatever. Its a minor point.

Wish I could say more about it, but this Hulk outing didn't grab me like The Incredible Hulk or Hulk vs.

However, if you're a Hulk fan, Im sure youll enjoy it for that reason, and if you like the more intelligent Hulk, youll have a good time for sure.",1425859200,,2214,4.4689826302729525

Voice acting was very good and animation was well crafted. No, it isn't going to be like a WB production; don't compare The Bat to the Hulk. But it was a solid story and I always get a thrill when Hulk is smashing something to bits. So if you came up with the comic book and you've been away for a while it might take an adjustment.

Then he escapes, returns with an army of freedom fighters, overthrows the Red King, and replaces him with a fair and just government only to have it all destroyed when the ship that brought him to this world explodes and destroys everything he's built for himself, even his new wife and child.  Then fueled by this rage he returns to Earth to seek vengeance on those that sent him to that world and that destroyed it.

I don't know how you take a story that epic and screw it all up, but these guys managed to do it!  First of all, there's only half the story here.  What about how they used Hulk's blood to start growing crops again?  What about when the Hulk decides he doesn't want a ""Shadow,"" but he wants her as a wife instead?  What about when he helps the Spikes escape the planet and return to the stars where they belong?  What about the army that he lead back to fight the Red King with?  What about when he fought the Silver Surfer as his final opponent?  What about when Miek goes into his cocoon and then becomes super big and strong?  Plus they totally left out the character of the Brood, she was one of my favorites in the comic!

Not to mention the story is all screwed up!  Hulk took out the Red King, they didn't inject him with one of the Spikes!  And they left out the Red King's monologue where he tells the Hulk that he loves being in charge and it's his ""pleasure"" to keep these people under his heel and rule them.

Why the hell can't Marvel just take a good comic book story and just put it on the screen?  Why do they have to try and ""adapt"" it or ""re-imagine"" it?  It was one of the greatest selling Hulk stories they ever put on paper, so why mess with it?  Just keep it the way it was and it'll probably sell just as well as the comic did!

4008067,4,B002WNUVJS,"The Hulk has gone through several transformations over his decades long existence, from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde monster to a Godzilla-like destroyer of worlds.  ""Planet Hulk"" attempts to reconcile all of these versions by reaching the logical conclusion that the Hulk (Rick D. Wasserman) is too dangerous to be on Earth, and the world's mightiest heroes send him to an uninhabited planet to live out his days in peace.

That was the plan, anyway. Instead, the Hulk rips free of the shuttle, causing it to crash into the planet Sakaar. He is immediately set upon by four-armed bug people that look suspiciously like Dark Sun's thri-kreen, which in turn are a lot like the multi-limbed tharks from Edgar Rice Burrough's Barsoom series. And that's not the only similarity. It's not long before red-skinned people enslave the Hulk, a lot like Barsoomian red martians.  The Hulk is thrown into an arena, not unlike how John Carter is imprisoned in the monthly games of Issus in Burroughs' The Gods of Mars. The Hulk bonds with his fellow gladiators: Shadow Person monk Hiroim (Liam O'brien), the stony Kronan called Korg (Kevin Michael Richardson), diminutive insectoid Miek (Samuel Vincent), red-skinned native Elloe Kaifi (Advah Soudack), and her lover Lavin Skee (Michael Kopsa).

Like John Carter, the Hulk's superior durability and strength give him an advantage over the natives.  Despite his advantages he is an unwilling leader, and in a plot ripped straight from ""Gladiator"" he becomes a symbol of hope amidst a repressive dictatorship led by the Red King (Mark Hildreth).  The Red King decides to make an example of the Hulk by putting him and his warbound gladiators into a series of increasingly difficult battles that culminate in a fight with Beta Ray Bill (Paul Dobson).  This is probably the only time that Beta Ray Bill doesn't come off as a ridiculous copy of Thor - in the alien setting, he fits right in.

Hulk's character shifts without comment from a bellowing brute to a brooding warrior, more gladiator than force of nature.  It's a natural transition that gives the character a fresh perspective, transforming the Hulk into a muscle-bound hero who is just trying to make his way in the world.  He even gains a love interest in Caiera (Lisa Ann Beley), bodyguard to the Red King.  It all comes to a head in a climactic battle in which a ship drops a cloud of Spikes onto the resident population, transforming them into spiny zombies.

Although there's no evidence of Bruce Banner, the Hulk does just fine on his own here, slowly coming to realize that he can exist as more than just a monster in a harsh world populated by the monstrous.  It adds a refreshing dash of green to the red palate of planetary romance.",1340841600,,2732,4.836909871244635
4008068,4,B002WNUVJS,"Planet Hulk is a movie based directly on the comic book storyline of the same name.

Hulk has been exiled  the heroes of Earth, who find him too dangerous and attempt to send him to an uninhabited planet where he'll have the peace he's always claimed to desire and, more importantly, endanger no one but himself.  But sitting quietly after being tricked is not Hulk's strong suit, and in his rage he damages the navigation system and ends up not only on an inhabited planet, but on one under absolute rule and a habit of turning uninvited guests into slaves.

Obviously the movie can't capture all the nuances of the nearly 400 page comic storyline, but it does capture the proper feel and overarching story very well while tightening everything up so it can be told in the time given.  It also manages to flesh out the supporting characters more than anticipated, which is extremely important as Hulk's actions arise from his interactions with them as much as the situation on the planet.  The pacing and construction of the story has to be very different considering the length of the source material, and the chosen changes were almost universally beneficial to making Planet Hulk succeed as a stand alone movie (leaving out explaining the spikes, changing when characters discovered things to have better dramatic arcs, and a tweaked ending much more suitable for a movie version, to name a few).

Overall Planet Hulk is a great animated movie that should be accessible and enjoyable whether or not you're familiar with the comic.  Good animation and voice acting supplement an epic story expertly trimmed to fit the format.",1339286400,,1628,4.851985559566787

Bruce Banner is gone, and this is not his story. All that remains is the Hulk. The Illuminati banish him from Earth as his rage causes too much destruction. The ship is sucked into a wormhole and transports Hulk to the other side of the Universe to the planet Sakaar. As he emerges from the wreckage he is enslaved (temporarily weakened by the wormhole) and thrown into a Gladiator contest with other slaves. Not taking too kindly to such treatment Hulk strikes back and kickstarts a revolution which will change the whole planet.

A lot of good stuff has been cut out. But on the upside the ending is much better and more upbeat. I just can't help but mourn what could have been though. The Planet Hulk story is truly epic, and to strip it down to the bone doesn't make much sense to me.

This movie however is epic.  You do not have to see Bruce Banner once in this movie.  That's a plus for me.  For some reason the Hulk is able to remain the Hulk indefinitely somehow...

Plus he is not dumb.  He talks, is intelligent and is not a stupid brute in this.  Sure he starts out like that, but like any great movie his character goes threw quite an evolution.

I have never read the comic series this is based off of, but I will buying this from Amazon soon.

Movie wise, the animation is solid, character voicing is fantastic.  They finally picked a good voice for the Hulk.  Also my fanboy gripe of how they always get the Hulk's blood color wrong was fixed in this movie.  His blood is green as is it supposed to be.  I like it when movie makers get the small things right.

4008079,4,B002WNUVJS,"I have to admit that while I've loved almost everything that Bruce Timm and company have done with the DC Universe in animation throughout the years, I have always felt that with a few exceptions, Marvel has never been successful at making the transition of the depth and richness of their books into animated form.  I toured their entire MLG (Marvel & Lion's Gate) library and came away feeling like while the animation was nice and the vocal talent pretty deep, the whole experience just felt shallow and dull.  However, being never one to give up on a solid idea, when I saw the preview for Planet Hulk on one of the DVDs, I decided I would have to give that one a go before writing off the whole MLG experience and truthfully, I'm really glad I did.

Based on Greg Pak's fantastic Incredible Hulk: Planet Hulk book, the film tells of Hulk's destructive nature to the planet finally reaching a point of unacceptability and The New Avengers: Illuminati's reluctant decision to jettison Hulk into space.  The original plan was to have his spacecraft crash onto a peaceful lush planet of greenery and livestock for which the Hulk could live out his remaining years alone but the plan is derailed when an enraged Hulk starts thrashing around in the capsule and causes it to crash land on an alien world somewhere between earth and his original destination.

Subdued by a restraining chip and sold into slavery, Hulk quickly finds himself in the role of Russell Crowe's character from the movie ""Gladiator"".  It turns out that the world he crashed upon (Sakaar) finds itself locked in a political dictatorship that has the people putting hope in the arrival of a savior to restore freedom to the land.

Without giving up any spoilers, the Hulk's incredible feats of strength in the coliseum aren't unnoticed by the populous and before long rumor begins to spread that perhaps his arrival was foretold in prophecy.  In an act of utter irony, Hulk's destructive nature is suddenly viewed as the catalyst for lasting peace.

The action begins in this one nearly immediately; wasting very little time with setup.  Hulk's crash sequence is complete by the opening credits and the alien world is presented with some pretty cool life forms and concepts.  Especially note worthy is that due to Sakaar's proximity to a wormhole, species of countless races crash land on the planet's surface and, because they are unable to leave, become the property of the Empire (in other words slavery is alive and well on Sakaar and involves far more than just the indigenous species).

The Hulk we're given here is surprisingly intelligent as well with his sheer uncontrollable rage offered as a sort of brooding determination.  We actually get some character evolution as well, with Hulk's gradual change from a sulking, primitive monster in the beginning to a beast with a sense of pride and honor by the end.  Bruce Banner makes not a single appearance here and while that may seem suspect to some die-hard Hulk fans, truthfully the slant toward a more intelligent Hulk blended with the fact that the alien world would have killed Banner instantly, makes this fact not only justifiable but plausible in the mythos as well.

Pacing is pretty quick (as is expected when stuffing some 400 pages of material into 72-minutes of film) and the action heavy gladiator sequences are offset with some nice splashes of back-story & character development.

With an ending that certainly hints to a ""what-if"" vibe, the whole story can technically be viewed as a sort of offshoot to the time-honored Hulk material but this is certainly not a bad thing.  Quite honestly Hulk's out of control nature here on earth lends beautifully to this exact scenario and it's really interesting to witness the green man pitted against enemies truly deserving of the beating he is capable of administrating.

In all, even if you've gone through the other MLG pieces and came away disappointed, Planet Hulk is certainly worth giving a go.  I'm truly hoping this piece has elevated the bar for all future Marvel animated features to follow.",1313193600,2,4089,4.857553956834533

tired cliches (eg. the weak, sniveling, cowardly character who manages to ""find his courage""

The overall story line has echoes of Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator"" movie with excellent fight scenes and sympathetic supporting characters.  A nice treatment of the classic Hulk character.",1290988800,,740,6.520408163265306

Beyond this, the only complaint that I had is that it wasn't longer, and they didn't show what happened in the end.  I guess the producers of the film wanted a happy ending.
The film pretty much the way the comic did, and the action was well-paced.  I am glad that I bought it.  This would be a good build-up to a World War Hulk movie, but Marvel would absolutely have to show what happened at the end of the Planet Hulk series to make up for them not incorporating it into this movie.",1284336000,,740,4.176056338028169

The animation is as good an adaption as can be expected when trying to keep the story self-contained.  Planet Hulk is a solid Hulk story with plenty of action and a touch of intrigue.  I gave it 4/5 stars since quite a bit of defanging was done to the original story. That being said, the core remains true to the characters.

No Brood

4008100,3,B002WNUVJS,"I'm a big comic book fan and every time the decision is made to adapt a character/storyline into the visual media, I'm always skeptical. Most movies animated movies if not all that have been released be it Marvel or DC have been lackluster in my opinion. But the fact that I love comics as much as I do, I end up falling into a sort of fanboy mentality and I go ahead and buy the movies anyway just because the idea of taking a great character and story and giving it motion is too big a chance to pass up. That being said, the Planet Hulk story arc (comics) to me was incredible. I thought it was an excellent read and the various artists that showed their talents on the pages were superb. The story itself actually spans 12 issues so there was a lot of story throughout. The problem with animated movies is that they aren't that long and I can understand that watching an animated movie for a prolonged period of time might get boring but Planet Hulk was not something that should have been condensed to 81 minutes. The art was pretty good and they stayed close to the original story for the most part (with the exception of the Beta Ray Bill character replacing the Silver Surfer in the comic) but I thought some of the dialogue was weak and there really wasn't enough time to develop the character relationships the way the comic did. If you're a Hulk fan and have never read the Planet Hulk story arc (that doesn't really seem to add up huh) buy the trade. Excellent read and you'll more than likely agree with me that more of the story should have been incorporated in the feature. I think a 3 star rating for the movie is right where it stands and if you do buy the Bluray there are plenty of extra features to keep you entertained after the movie's over. One thing I did read on someone else's review is to adapt the World War Hulk story arc into an animated movie and that idea does sound awesome but the time restrictions will always be a problem with animated movies.",1276819200,,1979,4.336927223719677

ok major downers about this movie compared to book
  in the movie the only big fight scenes are in the arena where  as many also took place outside the arena in the book.
  THE BIG FIGHT SCEN WITH SILVER SURFER isn't even in the movie instead they replaced him with  someone idk someone who imitates thore but looks like a horse.
  the ending sucks in the movie i guess cuase its pg,  hulk doesnt marry the grl she doesnt become pregnant the world doesnt blow up
  miek doesnt turn into the king no bug slaves get freed, there isn't a hive queen
  hald the monsters that were in the book arnt even in the movie the only monster in the movie is one tentacle thing not several  one robot king and then that thor guy, no lava monster no dino that hulk rides on, the fight scene at the training camp doesnt even take place in the movie

This animated movie managed to turn a fantastic storyline into a dumbed-down, choppy, poorly voice-acted version of a much better comic book. I honestly think the Ultimate Avengers movies were better. The best part of this was the cover artwork by Alex Ross. My suggestion? Watch it if it's on TV or something, but don't shell out the money.

Bravo to the cartoonists involved. I can't wait to see what you guys come up with next.",1271462400,,336,4.524590163934426
4008106,1,B002WNUVJS,"""Planet Hulk"" was directed by Sam Liu based on the comic book by Greg Pak. In this story, the Hulk has been deported by Iron Man from Planet Earth via a space shuttle and crash lands on another planet. Once there he is captured, enslaved, and forced to compete in gladiator games.

This story feels like a complete rip-off of the movie ""Gladiator"" directed by Ridley Scott in 2000. The Hulk is forced into combat in a series of fights, first with other slaves, then with big monsters and robots, then a very scary opponent in golden armor, before finally facing the Red King. When the Hulk starts gaining fame from the fans that he doesn't even want, the Red King hesitates to end his life fearing the reaction and by prolonging it, Hulk grows more popular and the people begin to regard him as their savior from legend.

The Red King's main bodyguard is Caiera, found by him after her village was attacked by little spiders that make people into really spiky zombies. She is almost invincible and indestructible with a gift for battle but slowly has her doubts about the Red King's decisions, much like the Emperor's sister in ""Gladiator.""

Beyond the obvious similarities, the character development remains very shallow for Hulk. He focuses on being angry, stubborn, and destructive throughout the story and we are given little insight into his motives. He just likes to smash things and is out for himself, not much of a team player. In a round table discussion with the other slaves that Hulk isn't a part of, two of them reveal a bit of their back stories since they are relevant to foreshadowing future events, but the other two do not.

The movie feels like it has a really slow beginning and it took a while to really get into it. The battle sequences are excellent complete with green blood squirting out of the Hulk whenever someone manages to land a punch on him. Once his green blood makes contact with this planet's soil, little green plants grow making his comrades a little more tolerant of his behavior and less skeptical about claims of his savior-ness. By the last thirty minutes of the film, it grew more exciting and though it was very predictable, it had some satisfying moments nonetheless.

This could be a good watch for your kids and the story will free fresh to them if they haven't seen ""Gladiator."" If you were only mildly interested in this movie, you can skip it. The story is very much the same with Marvel characters replacing them on an alien planet. However the ending might be different....",1270944000,,2525,4.6524663677130045
4008107,3,B002WNUVJS,"Definitely not as good as the comic.  The film attempts to jump into the story with little background, and then tries to summarize two years of Hulk stories, and, as my title suggests, does a lackluster job.  Pretty sad outing.",1270771200,,227,4.65

Having seen the blu-ray first and then reading the source material, I'd definitely recommend reading the source material as the whole Planet Hulk universe makes more sense, and is more palatable, with the character depth and lingo that is presented.

My only qualms with the blu-ray is that the colors don't quite pop they way they should for a blu-ray release, though some may say this is because of the muted color palate. You'll also notice some color banding after repeated viewings.

Having said all this, I enjoyed the release.",1270252800,,768,4.892307692307693
4008112,5,B002WNUVJS,"After the incredibly disappointing Ultimate Avengers films, I had low expectations for anything Marvel Animated and especially Planet Hulk.  But this Hulk really grabbed me and pulled me in to one of the best Hulk adventures I have ever experienced.  It begins with a video of Iron Man and the Illuminati explaining to Hulk that he has been exiled to another planet.  Hulk starts smashing up the spaceship and it crashes on the planet Sakaar, ruled by the Red King.  Hulk is captured and forced to fight in gladiatorial arena, where he rises to fame and bonds with a unique group of slaves who call themselves The Warbound.  Hulk must decide to challenge the Red King or seek a path of isolation, because unlike the Earthlings, the desperate people of Sakaar believe a monster is just the hero they need.

Planet Hulk is a Hulk you have never seen before.  All the other Hulk stories feature the struggle of Bruce Banner.  Then when Banner loses control, the character development is over, the story is over, he just transforms into Hulk and a giant slug-fest ensues.  But Bruce Banner isn't even in Planet Hulk, and we get to see how deep and conflicted the character of Hulk can really be.  It's not a journey of man into monster, it's the journey of a monster into a hero.  It isn't Banner's struggle, it's the Hulk's struggle.  But the character-work doesn't stop there, the Warbound group is a very interesting and well handled group of gladiators.

Which leads me to the fights.  The idea of making the Hulk a gladiator on an alien planet is such a good concept for his character that I can't believe this wasn't thought of sooner.  It gives Hulk ample opportunity to pummel a host of unique foes.  There's some really memorable fight scenes and powerful moments here.  Due to copyright issues, they could not feature the famous fight between Hulk and the Silver Surfer that's found in the comics.  Instead, they used Beta Ray Bill from Thor and tied it in with the events of Hulk vs. Thor.  The end result is a pretty incredible match.

I highly recommend Planet Hulk as a great exploration for Hulk's character, and Marvel Animation's best film to date.",1269993600,8,2161,4.666666666666667
4008113,3,B002WNUVJS,"The movie started out well.  The technology of the Obedience Disk makes Hulk smarter.  The writers give the fans insight into the Hulk's thoughts (i.e. his views of heroism, how his days of neverending conflict have affected his worldview).  The writers also reveal Caiera's backstory.

Unfortunately, after the Hulk vs. the Red King conflict resolves itself, the story simply ends.  There is no development of Caiera & Hulk's relationship.  There are no scenes of Hulk's life on Sakaar after the conflict.  A story as detailed and thorough as Planet Hulk deserves to be told in its entirety within the logistics of moviemaking.  The only way Marvel could make amends to Hulk and Planet Hulk fans for this partially-completed product is to make a World War Hulk animated film that is 2.5 hours long.  It has to contain the best Hulk vs. Iron Man battle Marvel has ever created.

While this movie has to be purchased in Blu-ray in order to fully appreciate the animation, I would recommend waiting until this movie is on sale before Hulk and Planet Hulk fans purchase it from Amazon.",1269907200,3,1082,4.831521739130435
4008114,5,B002WNUVJS,"You know, it really makes me happy that Marvel and Lionsgate has featured the Green Goliath in so many of thier animated features. Out of all of Marvel's list of heroes, he's one of my top five favorites. What makes me happy even more is that they've made an animated adaptation of Planet Hulk. While I didn't care for alot of the changes that they made to the story(changing Silver Surfer for Beta Ray Bill, for instance), overall- it is a great animated feature and one of Marvel's finest to date. I just wish Marvel and Lionsgate would start making more animated features of the storylines from the comics(much like Warner Brothers and DC Comics are doing with their animated movies). World War Hulk would be a great followup at somepoint, which Planet Hulk leads into. It would also be nice to see Marvel and Lionsgate do animated features on Marvel's cast of characters like The Inhumans, Spider-Woman, or Morbius, the Living Vampire.

In case you're new to the storyline, here's a recap of what this storyline is about...Hulk is exiled into outer space by Earth's mightiest heroes. Unfortunately, he crash lands onto planet Sakaar which is ruled by the Red King. Sold into slavery, Hulk is forced to fight as a gladiator. The desperate people of Sakaar believe The Hulk is just what they need to save them from the tyrannical Red King. The question is..will the Hulk be the one to save their world...or destroy it?

At any rate, as I stated before, it is a great animated feature and one of Marvel's finest. I'd also like to suggest you check out the graphic novel of Planet Hulk as well.",1269734400,,1594,4.648936170212766

The sound is nice on my surround sound system. I've noticed on Lionsgate releases the sound is usually top notch. The story was engaging and I cared about the characters. Seeing the Hulk say more then ""Hulk Smash"" was refreshing. Now is it better than Hulk Vs? I'm still pondering that one. Anyway if you dig the Hulk its a must buy.

He smashes the flight controls and crashes on a planet full of unpleasent beings. The main plot centers around Hulk's troubles on this world; from slave to gladiator to freedom fighter.

Along the way he mixes it up with various monsters, fights with Beta-Ray Bill (Beta-Ray Bill??? huh? Yes,it is true..) and pummels a not-so-small army. I liked this film, mainly because it improved upon the orginal story - especially the lousy way it ended. There is also a cameo appearance by Thor; in a re-telling of his origin story.

As you know by this is this your typical Gladiator/Spartacus Hulk storyline where the Hulk finds himself a slave and must fight his way to freedom.  Again a good theme but the execution of it was as if they were spiriting for the finish line and cut corners to do so.

There were many inconsistencies such as: Hulk thinking as a Grey Hulk, Hulk using full sentences one moment then sounding like the green Hulk the next, or even how Hulk is bound to slavery with a disk which is so easily destroy in the ending scenes.

4008133,2,B002WNUVJS,"In the featurette that accompanies Planet Hulk, the makers go through their use of the comic storylines on which it is based, and how they picked what they incorporated from the comic books.  (It seems like several of the customer reviewers have not watched the featurette, from their criticisms of how the animated movie lines up with the comic series.)  They also talk about how they thought the generic Hulk storyline was played out, and that a ""different kind of Hulk"" was called for.  So they came up with this new Hulk that speaks in complete sentences, has a romantic interest, can take a nap and wake up - staying as the Hulk the whole time - and so on.  My annoyance at this variation of the Hulk is that he has lost his distinctiveness.  Now that he sometimes has to think carefully about what he will do, now that his actions are usually not driven by pure rage (and in fact never transforms at all), he's just not as interesting a character to me.  One other thing I noticed is that his SIZE has diminished too.  He's often not much bigger than the other characters he interacts with, just much more muscular.  I guess that was necessary for the ROMANCE to occur... Anyway, they've taken the Hulk out of Planet Hulk, and I did not care for the result.",1266451200,6,1263,4.460869565217391

4008135,4,B002WNUVJS,"Marvel Animation seemed like it had the right idea at first. PG-13 rated direct-to-DVD animated films based on some iconic characters that looked to be handled in a potentially more adult style. Alas that was not to be. Their first release, ULTIMATE AVENGERS, based on the brilliant ULTIMATES series by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch, had some of the elements of the original comic, but opted for barely-par animation and not a lot of decidedly ""mature"" subject matter. In many ways, it was no more violent or adult than your standard Saturday morning cartoon. It was colorful and bright with a lot of childish humor. Its sequel, simply titled ULTIMATE AVENGERS 2, was more mature. Not much of a step formard in animation quality, but story-wise and action-wise, definitely better. Then came THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN, which was just sad. It's a feeble attempt to cash in on the success of the IRON MAN feature film. The retelling of the story is just very poor, and the animation is even worse than the AVENGERS films. Next came DOCTOR STRANGE, which in my opinion, is the best of the Marvel Animation projects. It has terrific animation, really good dialogue and a really good retelling of this character's origin story. Then there were the Avengers' Kids movie, which I quite honestly skipped. Then came the HULK VS. films. HULK VS. WOLVERINE was pretty satisfying, but still a little too focused on the character of Wolverine, and honestly, haven't we seen that dude enough? HULK VS. THOR was much, much better. This had all the makings of an epic conflict and it had epic storytelling. Really good stuff.

And now we have PLANET HULK, which is an adaptation of the new classic Greg Pak storyline in which a angry green goliath, whose fellow super-powered bretheren have deigned too dangerous for Earth, is exiled to a planet that is supposed to be a place where the Hulk can live in peace with plenty of game to hunt, lots of things to smash, and no other sentient beings to hurt. Unfortunately for Hulk, his anger shifts his exile-express shuttle off course, and he crashes on a planet with an unjust and opressive ruler, where gladiators duke it out for the populous' entertainment. And The Hulk becomes one of these gladiators. But perhaps he is destined for something greater... or perhaps worse.

PLANET HULK is essentially, as was mentioned in other reviews, Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR on big green gamma-irradiated steroids. There's no getting around that comparison. But, boy howdy, it's a good watch. We get to see Hulk doing what he does best (SMASH!), and it has a good, if predictable, storyline.

Now, there's been a lot of talk here also about the replacement of a major player in this tale by a lesser-known one due to Studio Ownership. Honestly, I think that Beta Ray Bill replacing The Silver Surfer is a big mark in the 'plus' column anyway. Beta Ray Bill is just way cooler. And I think that's been the consensus, in the sense that Beta Ray Bill is a suitable replacement.

Now for those who have no idea of what actually comes next in the comic world after the end of PLANET HULK, I hope there's a sequel...

Animation is pretty good here. Dialogue is also good. And I'm not sure if this is a plus or a minus, but the lack of 'celebrity' voice-work for the characters is a noticable difference from the DC Animation end of things. Again, personally, I like people like Nathan Fillion or Keri Russell (WONDER WOMAN) popping up, or David Boreanasz and Jeremy Sisto (JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER), or the endless supply of voice talent that DC Animation gets. But that's more a personal preference than an actually accounting of the work that Marvel does. Also, I was hoping for some inclusion from the comic, but this is a very good adaptation of the epic storyline that brought the Green Goliath back to A-List status.",1266019200,,3839,4.732436472346786
4008136,4,B002WNUVJS,"I had two unexpected snow-days from work this week; fortunately, I had a review of PLANET HULK to write, which served to stave off cabin fever. It was pretty good overall; the art was nicely done, with the scenery based on the comic's very-cool cover art (by artist Ladronn.) Sure, it deviated from the comic series on which it was based, but it was well-adapted to a movie format; it was written as a ""one-shot,"" self-contained story; the essential scenes were intact while making it a stand-alone story. Sure, there were changes like Beta-Ray Bill replacing the Silver Surfer, but those are superficial changes. (I personally like the way the incorporated the rock gladiator's story into the first Thor story, which featured similar rock-like aliens.)

  The most important change comes in leaving the Hulk on the planet, where he is not seen as a monster, but a hero. Consider these comments from the ""making of"" feature on the disc: ""...this isn't banner's struggle, it's Hulk's struggle...this is Hulk as his very best...as opposed to a ""Banner"" driven Hulk...He's not just the anti-hero that's out there to smash and cause trouble for the other real superheroes...""

  One the one hand, the ""Banner-driven Hulk"" is what made the Hulk unique in a world among heroes. Only, the ""real superheroes"" of the Marvel Universe were already different by presenting heroes as flawed, neurotic, and tragic; Spider-Man was treated as a menace, Iron Man a drunk, Captain America irrelevant, the X-Men freaks, and so on....it's true that the Hulk is most understood as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" story, except that he does associate with the Avengers, and is not out for glory or recognition as a hero...and he's not out to intentionally destroy, but just wants to be left alone; it's more a statement against society turning men into monsters.

  So what's interesting in PLANET HULK is the idea that the superpowered Illumaniti seeks to rid the world of the Hulk's destructive rage by exiling him to a peaceful planet. What they are really saying, however, is that they are exiling his uncontrollable power...uncontrollable by the powers that be, whether the government or the world's smartest heroes. What the Hulk represents is the raw individual who cannot be shaped or molded to society's conventions, best captured in the source of the Hulk's rage, which is not the gamma radiation, but the child abuse of the young Banner. As a result, the rage of the Hulk is really the rage of a child who just wants to be left alone. He cannot be an ""altruistic"" hero, because his story is one of self-preservation. By Marvel's standards, he cannot be a hero at all, because their heroes are consciously self-sacrificing. So the only option, then, is, ""this man, this monster...""

  Of course, the ship carrying the Hulk to his would-be peaceful planet goes off-course, and he lands on a planet run in Roman-Empire fashion, where he is captured and made a gladiator. This is where the Hulk as hero comes in; he initially fights for himself, with no concern for the other gladiators. But eventually he does come to see them as friends...more importantly, they come to see him as more than a monster...a hero, something he is not accustomed to, and something he initially cannot understand. In the comic, his efforts to start a family and lead a ""normal life"" are thwarted, resulting in WORLD WAR HULK, but here, there is a happy ending (an anomaly for a Marvel story!). The Hulk defeats the Red King, the slaves are freed, and a new age is upon the planet.

  There are suggested layers of political subtext that I'd like to have seen explored; mainly, the ending: what happens politically? The fall of the Red King and the rise of the Hulk leaves open questions of politics and government...does the Hulk become the new Emperor (suggested by the adulation from the crowd below)? Is it a new age of freedom? The Hulk himself is not a political figure in the Marvel universe, so it'd be a stretch to suggest that he corrects the flaws in the Roman-like empire that contradicted the constitutional elements via the dictatorship of Julius Caesar (or the influence of a corrupt government favored by Alexander Hamilton that undermines the American constitution). Then there's the question of treating the Hulk as a savior, a messiah even. At least, he's not the worn-out ""Christ-like figure"" (maybe more like Spartacus?), and the comparison between the fall of Rome and the rise of Christianity is wisely avoided, if only because the Hulk is a far cry from the meekness of Jesus. Yes, at the source of the Hulk is the abused Banner, who just wants to be left alone, but this is no altruistic tale of the meek inheriting the earth, but of the struggle for freedom for all.

  But putting all that aside (and it's probably for the best; if pressed philosophically, they may have gone the altruistic route; as it is, there's a certain neutrality that allows for my interpretation)...in its own way, the Hulk's story is a tale of laissez-faire individualism, of the freedom to be left alone, to associate with others as friends, not slaves. It is interesting that the Hulk could not be a hero on his home planet, where heroes are expected to be self-sacrificial, and rewarded with neurosis, public resentment, and tragedy. It's even more interesting that the creators of the PLANET HULK movie had to work outside of Marvel continuity to present a heroic character whose end is not tragic, whose heroism is not undercut by his own personal failings, and that this hero is the Hulk, just goes to show how much altruism, via Marvel Comics, has done to betray the idea of those so-called ""real superheroes"" in the first place.

4008137,4,B002WNUVJS,"Since I am an avid Hulk fan my opinion concerning the movie overall may be a bit bias. The action was great and the sequence of events were well placed. However there were some parts I just had to over look and accept as entertainment. First the stories did not totally match the comic book without the Surfer, though Beta Ray Bill was a suitable substitute. The Hulk not transforming back to David Banner when at his most calm state (unconscious), the existance of the hulks intelligence (possibly a certain version of the hulk) could have limited his strength in addition to passing through the worm hole, and the fact that the madder the Hulk gets the stronger he gets should have over ridden the initial loss of basic strength and the obedience disk that was attached. Now if the disk was the reason behind hulks intelligence why did he remain intelligent after the disk was distroyed by Beta Ray Bill.  These were some of my questionable moments. Additionally, I thought the movie was a cross between ""Gladiator"" starring Russell Crowe (as Maximus Decimus Meridius) and metaphorical occurances from a biblical perspective. With all that said, I still enjoyed it a great deal and recommend it.",1266019200,,1197,4.810679611650485
4008138,4,B002WNUVJS,"After about a year, Marvel comes back with yet another Hulk animated movie. However, this one is a full-length OVA instead of a double feature. Similar to the Ultimate Avengers films, this one is an adaptation of an existing Marvel Comics storyline.

Hulk wakes up with a bad hangover to discover he's on a spaceship bound for a distant planet. A secret group heroes(known in the comics as the Illuminati)banish him from Earth because he's too destructive. Hulk gets pissed and derails the ship to the savage planet of Sakaar. Once there, he is ambushed by a tribe of insects, only to get taken and enslaved by the local imperial soldiers. Hulk gets roped in with some other captives to take part as a gladiator, and fighting robots and monsters for the pleasure of the tyrannical Red King. Even though they are all controlled by special nano-device, Hulk manages to advance him and his friends to the last fight, who it turns out is against Beta Ray Bill, a horse-headed alien that was given the power of Thor by the Asgardians. Hulk busts Bill's controller, and Beta sets the rest of the gladiators free with a lightning blast. Hulk threatens the Red King if he comes after him, and then he seperates from his former teammates. Desperate to save face for her king, the royal bodyguard Caiera goes after him, and proves to be just as strong as Hulk. However, a plague of parasites called Spikes are sent to the city where Hulk's teammates are at. Caiera is shocked to find out that the were sent by the Red King himself, because they were the same Spikes that wiped out her family as a child. Hulk, Caiera, and the others then head back to the capital to brutally kick the Red King's ass. Hulk then becomes the leader of the newly freed Sakaar with Caiera as his queen.

Planet Hulk features probably the best animation in a Marvel animation movie to date. I'd say that the Marvel movies has better animation, although the DC Universe ones have better writing. Hulk totally goes full-mad in this one, beating the living crap out of anything that gets in his way. Some comics fans might be a little pissed that Beta Ray Bill replaced Silver Surfer from the original story, but they should keep a sharp eye out for cameos by Gamora, Adam Warlock, and Grandmaster. This movie adds a deeper level to the Hulk character rarely seen outside the normal comics, and way better than anything Ang Lee put together!",1265846400,,2405,4.616822429906542

Everything about this is lacklustre, from design to voice acting, none of it hits the mark. There was, to my mind, no reason to change and eliminate plot points for the sake of the films pacing, it feels too short and cobbled together.

4008142,4,B002WNUVJS,"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt obliged to share. I've watched the film a few times now, and while it's entertaining, it lacks the emotional punch and subtext that the comics had. I realize that translations from one medium to another are often imperfect - but the screenplay for ""Planet Hulk"" drops some of the best stuff from the comics.

I'm not talking about the Silver Surfer - though his absence was bothersome indeed. I'm talking about the lack of ambiguity. The original story asks some tough questions - what is a monster, really? Is the Hulk a savior, a destroyer, both, or neither? Is the Hulk a hero? Can anything good come out of anger? These are important questions, and they all got dropped. Miek's molting process was dropped, as did the horrible sacrifices he had to make. Elloe's father was dropped from the story entirely. Hiroim and Elloe likewise lost character depth. And I just realized that ""No-Name"" of the Brood was missing, too - a shame, because ""Planet Hulk"" may have been the first time that a Brood has been depicted as a heroic figure.

This may sound like nitpicking, but it's not. The original comics had a depth of characterization and subtext that is somewhat atypical for the Hulk. The Hulk tends to be a two-note character - anger and tragedy - and ""Planet Hulk"" helped move him away from that and into more interesting territory. This animated feature drops all of that, leaving just the mildly entertaining, if predictable, hack and slash (and smash) story with a happy ending.

Marvel Animation has done better in the past and could have done a lot better with this. It's just a shame that so much content and potential was lost.",1265673600,2,1681,4.691525423728813

4008144,5,B002WNUVJS,"Animated films like this one are the reason why Marvel is king. Honestly, most agree that the Marvel Universe is the richest, most entertaining fictional realm ever imagined by man. Now, it's good to see live action and animated features that can match or at least come close enough to the magnitude of the books. While not as complex as the reads themselves, these animated features carry their own level of satisfaction. Just like ""Hulk VS"" before it, this film delivers the goods. It's more than fun to see Hulk in a gladiatorial setting. It's a blast to see Beta Ray Bill pop in from out of nowhere! When you compare these animated films to their only real competition, it clear to see that Marvel still has the advantage. Planet Hulk makes Green Lantern: Fist Flight look sick by comparison. Hulk VS outclasses the mindless Superman/Batman: Public Enemies and so on. When the foundation is stronger, the things built upon it will be stronger as well.

For those who read the graphic novel you will be sad with some of the changes (you can thank lawyers for that)!

4008146,4,B002WNUVJS,"Not that I read the Hulk's comic book much anymore, but Greg Pak's PLANET HULK a few years ago was probably the best Hulk story arc to come out since Peter David and Dale Keown were running things back in the day. PLANET HULK plucks the misunderstood monster from an environment rife with puny humans and allows him to finally cut loose. The savage, no-holds-barred sword and sandals epic we're then treated to comes off a bit like Conan the Barbarian on 'roids.

The Illuminati (made up of the world's pre-eminent superheroes) had had enough of Bruce Banner's anger management issues and had decided to banish the Hulk off-planet, deploying the spaceship he's on to a planet with no intelligent life force. Except that the ship goes off-course, and so the surly green giant instead crash lands on the unforgiving warrior world of Sakaar.

This film only runs an hour and 21 minutes, and so it doesn't quite adopt the epic sweep of Greg Pak's narrative. But it touches on core plot points, tracking the Hulk's rise from slave to gladiator to savior to bloodied ruler of Sakaar. Very, very few humans can survive on this harsh planet, but Sakaar is ideally suited for the Hulk's temperament, and the daunting challenges he faces fully engage his skills set (his skills set comprising, of course, of his strength and recuperative power). Like I said, this is the Hulk finally unleashed. PLANET HULK is basically Bruce Banner's alter ego ending up in his own version of the Happy Hunting Ground. On Sakaar, the Hulk finds acceptance and love and kindred spirits. How do you soothe the savage beast? I guess you stack up a gauntlet of scary giant monsters and ferocious warriors against him. I guess you have him rubbing elbows with people who appreciate aggressiveness, a streak of anger, and awesome, awesome strength. All the qualities that got him exiled from Earth in the first place. Puny humans.

So no surprise that the action comes fast and furious and bloody - this is definitely PG-13 material. But it's not just about the Hulk wreaking havoc. We see him grudgingly allying himself with the Warbound, and the Warbound aren't chumps like weak Earthlings. The Oldstrong warrior Caiera is also a key presence, probably the most relevant character after the Hulk himself, and she proves to be a match for the Hulk. The best fighty fight, though, has to be between the Hulk and the very formidable Beta Ray Bill.

It's nice to see the Hulk with a more complex emotional arc. This film is all Hulk, all the time - Bruce Banner takes a back seat (heck, he's in the friggin' trunk). But this time the green guy is portrayed as something other than just this green mass of bottled-up rage, although, okay, there's plenty of that, too. He finally finds a place that he can call home, but it's a struggle for him to come to terms with that.

It's been a while since I read the story, but I do know that there was a Brood sister as part of the Warbound, and I guess she didn't make the cut here. Also, Beta Ray Bill (a personal favorite of mine) subs for the Silver Surfer. Apparently, there were legal issues involved and even Norrin Radd can't contest with the court system.

DC recently came out with SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, in which those two went up against a whole mess of superheroes and -villains. So I don't know if Marvel's willing to piggy back on that and come out with a film version of WORLD WAR HULK, which is the tragic follow-up arc to PLANET HULK. It'd be awesome to see the Hulk putting the beatdown on the Avengers, the X-Men, the FF, and so on.

The story being as predictable as it was, drastically drifted from the Comic. They make Hulk get some shiny disc attached to his chest, and somehow that makes him able to speak thier language, but it also somehow improves his intelligence. It was the shiitiest twist on the storyline ever. They also neglected to put in the real end of the story which is the most relevant event in the comic because it leads into World War Hulk. I genuinely got excited for this, but it looks like someone wrote a SciFi story and then they cut and pasted the names and characters from the comic and put them in the movie. Marvel seems to only get half of their staright to dvd movies right. Iron Man sucked, Dr. Strange Sucked, The Avenger Movies were decent, Hulk Vs Wolverine was Cool, Hulk Vs Thor; not bad...

For example the gladiators are kept in line by tazer discs that shock them if they misbehave. Midway through the movie Hulk shoves a sword through Beta Ray Bills disc and shorts it out. If it were that simple, why didn't it happen in the first 10 minutes? Hulk himself is completely inconsistent. sometimes behaving like a mindless brute and sometimes calm and relatively intelligent. No explanation is given for why he never turns back into Bruce Banner. The other characters are either ciphers or (in the case of the bug-like Jar Jar Binks/Golllum character) gratingly annoying.

4008149,5,B002WNUVJS,"If you like the Hulk this movie is for you.  It takes all the elments that make the character attractive and improves upon them.  The story is essentially Savage Hulk liberates planet.  He's asked to leave by the Avengers.  I would have liked to have seen that battle in animated form.  For all intents and purposes it was worth wait. While some liberties were taken with the story it was entertaining.  How about a sequel with World War Hulk?  This one at least has Hulk with Banner's brain.

It's a thinking man Hulk kind of movie.  If you are a fan of the comics or just like this type of animation, you won't be let down.  It's worth watching a few times.  the extras do add quite a bit in the making of this saga.  If Marvel reads these reviews, I have to say, how about a Spidey animated film?

On a historical note: back in the 1970's, Roy Thomas adapted Harlan Ellison's plot, ""Brute That Shouted Love at the Heart of the Atom"".  In this other dimension; Hulk found the second love of his life, Jarella.  Too bad this story wasn't incorporated into the film.  Ironically he was not the intellegent version.  In the 70's his character was of the ""Hulk Smash"" mentality.  Artist Herb Trimpe was the quintessential Hulk artist at the time.

4008150,5,B002WNUVJS,"So if you're big into the Marvel and DC animated films I highly recommend this one for your collection. I hadn't read Planet Hulk when I bought this, but this animated film caused me to go and order the graphic novel to get the full in depth story. I found the animation to be great and story very entertaining. I don't collect the Hulk comics, but I loved the live action version so I picked this one up out of habit. It gives a whole new hero dynamic to the Hulk because for once he finds a world that appreciates his rage driven nature and in turn it gives him a new perspective and purpose as a superhero. It was definitely shortened up and at a few points I was left wondering what had happened in the comic that they obviously had to omit to fit it into a 90 min film. Really that didn't bother me too much because it instead inspired me to get a hold of the original comic so I could find out about the additional gladiators Hulk fights with (like why Meik is black and not yellow like the rest of his insect_like people). I love the animated films coming from Marvel and DC and I'd say this and Wonder woman (by DC) have so far been my favorites. As a little spoiler they do swap out Silver Savage (aka Silver Surfer, who I love from FF4) with Beta Ray Bill which is a bold tangent from the comic, but really I like it a lot because, if like me, you don't know every singe Marvel character, you get introduced to Beta Ray Bill and that's a treat in its self. In my opinion of course. finally and probably best of all, the Hulk finds a love interest as the Hulk not Bruce Banner (Banner is not in this film at all, its all about the Hulk developing as a Superhero)! Which is just a teaser really, but it gives the whole movie a great symmetry that I found very satisfying. The Special feature are Ok and answer a few question you may have about their artistic licenses. Nothing spectacular but it was only a dollar more for the Special edition at Target so I'm not complaining, but if you're tight on cash, opt for the regular edition, you're not missing much. The motion comics included in the special feature are interesting (spider woman and an x-man comic), but I am actually not a huge fan of that sort of story telling because of the weird image distortion used. Now if they'll just make World War Hulk as a animated sequel that's just as good as this that would be awesome!",1265328000,,2387,4.2368421052631575

4008152,5,B002WNUVJS,"I've read and am a huge fan of the Planet Hulk comic (I actually own every issue of The Incredible Hulk except for #2 and #5).  I am really impressed with how Lionsgate was able to capture the essence of the Planet Hulk storyline in under an hour and a half!  Planet Hulk is an epic adventure and this movie had to cut down the storyline to something that could be told in a reasonable time frame (for those who argue that it should be split into multiple movies: get real; The first part may sell decently, but the next parts would have an increasingly limited audience).

Anyways, while I wish it were possible to tell the entire epic story that is Planet Hulk, this movie did an incredible job of condensing it.  There's huge amounts of action and copious amounts of violence and bloodshed.  For this reason, this movie is NOT appropriate for young kids...characters get dismembered, crushed, squeezed until their eyes explode from their head, etc. But it's not just one big fight;  There's a lot of character development that occurs throughout the film.  And this marks the first appearance of the articulate green Hulk in a Marvel animation (The articulate Grey Hulk had appeared in the 1996-97 Incredible Hulk cartoon, but the intelligent green Hulk hadn't been seen before).  I've always found this articulate Hulk to be a lot more interesting than the classic ""Hulk Smash puny human"" savage Hulk that most people are familiar with.  I should note that the original Incredible Hulk from 1962 was this articulate Hulk; It wasn't until a couple of years later that the Hulk's intelligence was (gradually) diminished and his speech devolved to the ""Hulk crush metal man"" variety.

This movie does not discuss the fact that the Hulk is articulate, nor does it delve into the Bruce Banner/Hulk dynamic.  In fact, Bruce Banner is never even seen nor mentioned in any fashion.  Even in the comic, Banner is only seen briefly.  If you listen to the audio commentaries, they give a couple of theories that the film makers used to justify it to themselves: 1. This planet may well be toxic to humans, thus preventing the Hulk from reverting to Banner.  And 2. The wormhole that the Hulk went through to get to the planet may have infused him with additional Gamma Radiation, thus allowing him to remain as the Hulk.  Neither explanation is really needed, as this incarnation of the Hulk does not strictly follow the classic Anger=Hulk / Calm=Banner dynamic (but, since the movie never communicates this to the viewer, I can understand some people being confused and wondering why the Hulk never reverts to human form).  Interesting Hulk fact: In the first issues of The Incredible Hulk (in 1962) the transformation into the Hulk was triggered by sunset.  The sunrise would trigger the change back to Bruce Banner.  Later, adrenaline would cause the change both into the Hulk and Banner!  So the madder the Hulk got, the weaker he got...if the Hulk got too worked up, he'd revert back to Bruce Banner (thankfully, this odd concept was short-lived).  Soon after, it was established that adrenaline would cause the change into the Hulk, and sleep or extreme calm would cause the change back into Bruce Banner.

One criticism that I don't really get is when people complain about Beta Ray Bill being in the film...the way they did it actually works *better* than the way it was in the original comic (minus the fact that Hulk hadn't met and befriended Bill in the past...but, again, the way it was portrayed in the movie works *so* well).

Another criticism is that the movie ends well before the Planet Hulk storyline has finished.  The film makers wanted to end on a happier note without fundamentally changing the story, so they chose to end it earlier.  I completely agree with this decision.  The comic continues into another storyline called World War Hulk, in which the Hulk journeys back to Earth to seek righteous vengeance against those who exiled him...but I feel it would have been a mistake to incorporate a World War Hulk tease into this movie, as it would be quite some time before Marvel would be able to deliver that movie (for legal reasons, with Fox owning the movie rights to some Marvel characters, and Sony owning the movie rights to other characters, who knows when Marvel could do a good World War Hulk movie?)

From a technical perspective, the BD video and lossless audio is top notch and the disc is absolutely loaded with extras.

In summary, I was really blown away with this movie.  It truly exceeded my expectations and perfectly captured the essence of the comic.  Even if you're not a fan of the Hulk, I'd urge you to give this movie a shot, as this is the Hulk as you've never seen him before; Intelligent, crafty, articulate, but ever still the legendary engine of destruction.",1265241600,3,4805,4.74849578820698

4008156,1,B002WNUVJS,"As a huge fan of the ""Planet Hulk"" comic, which is one of the best Hulk stories ever, I found this animated rendition very disappointing. What made the comic so captivating was its development of the Hulk and the supporting cast. Over the course of the 19 or so issues that comprise ""Planet Hulk"", due to Greg Pak's rich character development, we grew to know and to love the heroes (Hulk, Caiera, and the Warbound) and hate the villains, especially the Red King. This was a Hulk personality that we had never seen before: a hate-filled, yet stoic Hulk, who became the savior of the wartorn world of Sakaar and won the hearts of its people through deep trials and tribulations. In my opinion, this Hulk personality is the best one ever created, and is what makes ""Planet Hulk"" such an enjoyable read.

In this horrible animated rendition, they fling away all of the character development that made the comic so great, revert Hulk to his brainless, ""hulk smash"" personality and completely butcher ""Planet Hulk"" as basically a Justice League style knockdown, dragout fest where, within the span of an hour, Hulk progresses to smash everything evil on Sakaar with minimal dialogue on his part. If you don't mind watching Hulk beat the living crap out of everything that moves while howling like an enraged gorilla, you might enjoy watching this, but as someone who was hoping to see a decent rendition of the great ""Planet Hulk"" comic, this was an epic fail. Do yourself a favor and spend the money to buy the graphic novel instead.",1265155200,8,1529,4.726591760299626

However, the Hulk may be the prophecised savior that is just what the planet needs. While the minor differences (such as swapping Silver Surfer for Beta Ray Bill) in the storyline don't detract from what the comic offered, the happy ending here most definitely does.

4008160,4,B002WNUVJS,"If you're picking this up because of the amazing 12-part storyline in ""Hulk"" a few years ago, you're going to be a little disappointed. Due to time constraints a number of things had to be skipped, glazed over, or changed altogether. The biggest omission comes from the loss of ""The Silver Savage"" (due to licensing problems, I guess) and the hero they chose to take his place. It makes sense, I suppose, as I can't think of anyone who would notice if this character dropped off the radar forever. Still, it made for an interesting fight and close to as good as the one with the Silver Surfer.

Another change is in the ending. This story stops just before the final pages so you don't see the set-up for ""World War Hulk"", which is a shame. It would have been an awesome way to end the show as Hulk lands a raging savage, then becomes a king, then leaves the planet as a raging savage again. Still, for the sake of a casual viewer who would have been asking what came next, I see why they ended it as they did.

If you haven't read the series and are just interested in the Hulk, you're going to love this. The story is complete and you'll never notice the small details your comic book friends might mention. This thing has almost frantic action at times, but you'll feel the excitement as the Hulk cuts loose in the arena against monster after monster. A word of warning in that it is pretty violent (heads are seen crushed, people are stabbed, etc) because it is essentially a gladiator movie, but all of the deaths are aliens, which means most of the ""blood"" you see is colored differently. Not a big deal, but little kids might find it a little too intense (though their dads will probably find it tame).

This is one of those videos you're going to want to own. As a bonus, it also includes a look at next year's animated offering ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"" (skip it).",1265155200,6,1871,4.3861671469740635
4008161,2,B002WNUVJS,"Unlike Ultimate Avengers 1 and 2 this movie is not.  I am a hardcore Hulk comic book fan and that could be why I am so hard with this movie. I hate having to give this bad review but I do not know what the people at Marvel Comics were thinking is like the first Hulk movie directed by Ang Lee! Anyways here's a quick recap and be very warned it contains SPOILERS!!!

The intro is near comic book perfection and it makes it clear that Hulk is not in Kansas anynmore by the alien language. The action in the arena is brutal and graphic not apt for children.  However it is obvious that the arena sequences are condensed and sped up, so eventually they face Beta Ray Bill (Even though I like them) yep instead of the Silver Savage! what the heck Marvel??? No silver Surfer?? That killed it for me there. So they escape and then from there everything is sped up which leads toa pretty decent battle between Hulk and Red King and then the end really sucks, that's all I am going to say, well no I will add smells like a rushed movie.

Some technical aspects:

Movie last 81 minutes according to the back of the book.
Graphics are ok in Blu Ray nothing like 3d effects so you are kindfa better just buyind the dvd version and safe some money. Lets say the art is not like the comic book story unlike DC's Public Enemies which was flawless.
Action is somewhat ok,there's killing, red blood, green blood and the nastyness of the spikes possesing people
Story starts good but then it turns into Planet Hulk light and condensed lots of stuff gets skipped like No Name Brood is not there at all.
My Walmart version came with Wolverine and the X-Men Hulk episode, Spiderwoman Motion Comic, X-Men Motion Comic, Thor Tales of Asgard opening sequence (by the way this movie is coming in 2011), two music videos from X-Men and Spiderwoman and of course disc 2 the digital copy of Planet Hulk. I have no idea if the Amazon version has all these contents.

Why did Marvel sucks in the animated movies department they should take pointers from DC comics on how they deliver in their movies.  I could not give this movie more than two stars and lie to all of you in what I found simply a rushed condensed project and very bad adaptation of the comic book series. Like the tittle of my review said by at your own risk or just rent it.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day, hope this what helpfull.",1265155200,2,2379,4.330337078651685
4008162,5,B002WNUVJS,"So I finally got my hands on Marvel's newest animated feature, ""Planet Hulk,"" and I must say, HULK SMASH!! Now I've noticed after watching the film that Hulk has been in almost every Marvel Animated feature except ""Invincible Iron Man,"" and ""Dr. Strange."" The Green Goliath is certainly in demand. And even though the last release, the double scoop of gamma goodness that is ""Hulk Vs."" had him heavily featured, it seemed more like he was a guest in Wolverine and Thor's story. ""Planet Hulk"" is all Hulk, all the time. Before I get into the review I should mention that this is Marvel's first actual story adaptation since ""Ultimate Avengers,"" and I have to say it's the best one to date, and that includes DC/Warner Premier's adaptations as well ""Superman:Doomsday,"" and ""Justice League:New Frontier."" That said on to the review.

I'm going to try not to go overboard but it's really hard for me. When ""Planet Hulk"" hit the comics stands back in 2006-2007 I was very excited to see this new take on the Hulk and this new adventure he was on. The basic premise is Hulk meets ""Gladiator/Spartacus."" After years of trying to keep the total destruction caused by the Hulk to acceptable levels, some of Earth's smartest heroes decide to exile him to a remote planet where he can do any harm but can live free of torment, and live the life of solitude the Hulk always craves. But as always his rage gets the best of him and his struggle to free himself alters the course of the ship he's in sending him through a wormhole and crash-landing on the planet Sakaar. It is here the story truly begins.

The film itself hits all the right beats, and has most of the major action set pieces from the book. It also looses a lot of the context and subplots that are woven throughout the year long story line. This is the biggest issue I had with the film. I know it had to be done, and most of it isn't missed if you've never read the source material, but if you have it's glaringly obvious. The comics had a running subplot of political upheaval and xenophobia. Though hinted at in the film it's not a topic at all really. Another major issue I had with the film is it's handling of one of the supporting characters in the story. **SPOILER WARNING** Skip the next paragraph if you want to go in to the film with no knowledge of the story other than the basic premise. This won't be super spoilerific but it's gonna give some of the changes away as a warning to those who've read the source material.

I read reviews of the film before I got to see it and I'm glad I did. They were all favorable reviews but they gave away plot info and had I not gone in knowing this stuff I may have disliked the movie. In the story Hulk ""befriends"" some other gladiators, and after the death of one of them in their first arena battle, they become ""Warbound,"" brothers and sisters in survival. Each gets to tell their story and how they came to be where they are now. It was a touching scene in the books, but was only glossed over in the film. Understandable for time constraints, but they cheated by doing a fade out when they get to the third story, so though we may not see it, it does play out. In the books Hulk tells his story and actually joins in their newfound bond, but in the film he's played as a loner. In the books, Miek, an insectoid native of Sakaar, who is an outcast for not having a hive of his own, goes from timid weakling, to courageous underdog, to fullgrown insectoid King. Yes King. To say more would ruin things. None of this happens in the film. Again time constraints, but it was a much missed aspect of the story and the character. Finally some of the changes that were made for licensing issues that didn't bother me at all were to minor characters that show up in the story. The heroes that send Hulk into space in the books are Mr. Fantastic, Dr. Strange and Iron Man. Because Mr. Fantastic and the FF are currently owned by Fox they weren't used (though his silhouette is unmistakable), nor was the Silver Surfer who shows up halfway through the story for a serious slugfest. His replacement did just as good. Beta Ray Bill is an alien who actually stood toe-to-toe with Thor in a fight, and whose heart was so noble he was able to lift Thor's hammer Mjolnr. Odin was so impressed he gave him his own hammer, ""Stormbreaker,"" and the rest is comics history. He's awesome and it was great to see him show up.

All changes aside I stand by my claim that it's the best adapted story to be animated yet. Great action, dialogue ripped right from the comics, and a story that though truncated and condensed, is still compelling. The film ends earlier than where the comic did but it's forgivable. Even with it being a PG-13 film, with lots of violence and several bloody scenes, the writers wanted this to have a self-contained and upbeat story. The comics end with Hulk heading back to Earth for revenge. That would have been awesome, and could even still be possible, but I definitely get why they ended it where they did. Most of the stuff I wanted to see in this film was there. The gladiator combat, the Warbound, the crazy monsters, and the Marvel Universe references. I got more in the film than in the comic, as several of Marvels cosmic characters show up in the crowd scenes at the arena.

Like all Marvel Animated features their special features far outweigh Dc's with two documentaries; one a making of and the other a look at the comic arc it was based on, an episode of ""Wolverine and The X-Men"" featuring the Hulk, two motion comics (Spider-Woman and Astonishing X-men) and two music videos for them, and lastly the opening scene from the upcoming ""Thor:Tales of Asgard"" animated film. So should you see this movie? HELL YES! Should you buy it? If you're a Hulk fan, action fan, or comic fan then MOST DEFINITELY! It's well worth it even with all the lost material.",1265068800,5,5879,4.449907235621521
4008163,5,B002WNUVJS,"Having grown up an all-out fan of the Incredible Hulk to begin with, words cannot express how excited I was to read the Planet Hulk and World War Hulk sagas in comic book/graphic novel form for the 1st time, nor how ecstatic I was to hear through the grapevine that Planet Hulk, perhaps one of the character's greatest, most unique and innovative storylines, was being released on dvd as an animated movie(a dream of epic porportion come true), so I'm going to keep it short and sweet.

Give or take a few characters and sequences, we have a faithful adaptation of the Planet Hulk saga...Hulk's exile to outer space by the Illuminati, his crash landing on Sakaar, his being captured by the Red King, his Romanesque clashes as a gladiator, and ultimately, his falling in love with the 'Emperor's Shadow'(who would later become the Hulk's wife/queen) and dethroning of the Red King, ruling as king himself over Sakaar. An action-packed sci fi phenomenon from start to finish...speaking of which, those who are familiar with the comic book/graphic know as I do that Marvel HAS to give us a World War Hulk dvd in the long run. To leave this grand, emerald flag flying at half mass would be Alpha without Omega, a Beginning with no End, a whetting of appetites for NOTHING.

4008164,4,B002WNUVJS,"Whilst not the best Lion's Gate Marvel feature, Planet Hulk is enjoyable and entertaining.  Think of Gladiator in Space, with the Hulk in the title role.  My main gripe about this film is the character of the green skinned behemoth.  This dude is not the fellow I knew from the Hulk comic books.  He seems more like Mad Max or the High Plains Drifter, the Man with No Name that Clint Eastwood played.  He does and says many things that are way out of character for the Hulk.  I also had a little difficulty buying into the problems Hulk had in dealing with his imprisonment.  They pass this off by claiming that the Wormhole has a weakening effect on every one who passes through it. Is that so?  Is that true for un-naturally fueled, Gamma radiation powered beasts like the Hulk also?

Nevertheless, I did get a big kick out of this movie.  It is a lot of fun.  I also enjoyed the Thor & Beta Ray Bill mini-adventure we saw in the middle.  That was very cool.  If I had sons, I am sure they would love it.",1265068800,2,1006,4.2592592592592595
