Ive watched the show many times on netflix and the quality of the video is much worse than in Netflix. Thats the only reason it isn't 5 stars. It is an amazing show, I love the bonus features (especially the bloopers), and there are some scenes in the DVDs that are not on Netflix or shown on TV. I love it.

1173114,1,985357456X,"The show is great, but the quality of this boxed set is abysmal (and not in the Joey way). The Blu-Ray set was double boxed with both boxes being ripped or torn upon arrival. The innermost box, the one that holds the discs, the glue had already ripped away from the box, creating a free-floating insert. Furthermore, the DVDs and Blu-Rays each have different content on them; blu-rays have the NBC episodes as they aired, with one un-aired episode; the DVDs have the original un-cut episodes with ~2mins of extra content per episode. The discs are fine, the show is great, but I regret everything else about this purchase. Complete waste of $120.",1516060800,2,646,4.725663716814159

1173136,2,985357456X,"I have owned Friends on dvd for years and have enjoyed many episodes on many occasions.  Friends is one of the box sets (have purchased dozens) I have replaced with Blu-ray for the superior video quality. While viewing this Blu-ray version, I have noticed some scenes from some episodes have ""disappeared"", and yes, I would call these chops not really essential or critical to the story line, but I will call them ""missed"".  When it comes to offering the consumer these full series box sets, especially at the cost of some, I would like to think the studio would use the master recordings.  This offering does not appear to be pirated or bootlegged, it does appear to be developed by the studio.
If I knew this Blu-ray offering was 'hacked up' as it is, I would most definitely NOT have made this purchase, even with the price slashed as it has been. The quality of the dvd boxed set is surprisingly good.  If I want to view the hacked up syndicated version in high definition, I could stream it.",1512259200,,996,4.5474860335195535
1173137,2,985357456X,Don't buy this one. There are scenes missing like they are on netflix. Like when Monica and Rachel are explaining sex to Chandler and after they finish they all get up and go to separate rooms. Or when Monica is being fitted for her bridesmaid dress and she's talking to Emily about postponing the wedding. Or when they are in Barbados and Monica calls Mike to tell him that Phoebe is getting proposed to and she's going to say yes. Everywhere throughout the show there are just random scenes missing.

1173139,3,985357456X,The DVD Set is better. Than the Blue Ray I just bought. Blue DVDs have scenes deleted. DVD has full episodes. I was disappointed. It happens on just about every disc.  I'm going to purchase the DVD set it's better,1509494400,2,213,4.325

1173157,5,985357456X,"Love friends, one of my favorite shows growing up and the quality is excellent. Some scenes you can see the quality drop a little because it was a scene they had to pull from a lower quality but I've seen it happen twice after 6 seasons now so it's not often and it's usually for a few seconds. These versions are from TV I believe because we used to own some of the seasons on DVD and they had extra scenes than whats on this set. But they don't cut out anything important which is good.

It comes in a nice box set with a book containing all episodes and a snipit about the pilot. All the blu-ray disks were in great condition and work.",1505520000,,638,4.104

It's difficult to navigate and unless you figure out how to chapter skip or play all you'll only see the fist few episodes. Should have included more BANG for your BUCk as they say. Focus on better navigation and add in commentary from directors, actors, other guest stars and hidden facts and info. We all love friends and it's okay to explain shots, budgets, cuts,and extras. Mostly focus on design and navigation. 3 stars for DVD quality and box cover design is good.

I pop them in, start to watching and realize... they are the edited for TV versions of the episodes. My question is, why did the older DVD releases have the extended episodes, and the newer blu-ray releases edited for TV? It is noiticable in pretty much every episode, which for someone that has seen the extended episodes, is very irksome. I haven't gotten through the whole series on blu-ray yet, but I have to say I'm sorely disappointed with this. And as another posted, I don't notice a picture quality change either, so this really wasn't an ""upgrade"" for me. Very sad.",1492387200,5,734,4.485074626865671

Only issues with set is the assembly of disc inserts and a couple of lose disc with light scratches. The misalignment of DVD inserts holding disc caused the first season DVD set inside case to shatter. The insert was not secured at the top but was at the bottom which caused it to twist and break during shipping or storage. None of the disc in season one were lose nor damaged.  The other seasons inserts were lose as well at the top but none of the remaining cases were damaged but a couple of disc were lose resulting in a few light scratches.  4 star for poor manufacture/assembly of DVD cases resulting in lose disc and damage to the set.,1488153600,4,760,4.293706293706293

1173265,4,985357456X,"It's hard to overstate just what a phenomenon this show was when it was aired.  People would, yes, arrange their entire evenings around the show.  There'd be viewing parties.  It really was something.

And on balance, the show really deserved the attention.  It was hip, smart, funny, and we who were in the age group of the characters could identify with the relationships and issues on the show...that weird time that everyone will experience (or already has) where your friends are your family, and you hang out with them until you make your own family.  And sure, given that the last episode of the show aired over ten years ago (in 2004) means throughout the run the settings and such will be somewhat dated (the first season aired in 1994, before ubiquitous smart phones, Internet, etc...).  Even at that, the show's early seasons are still very watchable.

Alas, the later seasons really started losing their steam...it looked like the writers and producers weren't really sure how to continue the character arcs, and things started getting more contrived.  But then the show ended on a very good note, and that was it...they all went their separate ways, with their own families, and suddenly the ""Friends"" were no more.

This presentation, while welcomed, differs from the season-only boxed sets.  The individual seasons have extra material and such in the episodes, whereas this presentation omits the extra material.  The episodes here are exactly as the show aired.  That may be desirable, or may not...it depends on what you're looking for I suppose.  I confess to being disappointed by the lack of the extra material, hence my four star rating.  I'd like to see a definitive director's-cut full series presentation.

But it's still a good show, and even a time capsule of sorts.  When I'm feeling nostalgic, I confess to treating this show like Comfort TV and watching a few episodes.  I like it.",1471996800,,1910,4.915625

A line here or there may not seem like much, but the are key quoteable moments all throughout the series starting within the first few minutes of the pilot episode. (Phoebe's line, ""Fine. Be murky."" Is nowhere in sight.) It's quite disappointing when you go to say your favorite lines along with the show and they are not there. As someone who has seen every episode so many times that she can almost quote them verbatim, these lines are extremely noticeable. If it was just a spot or two it wouldn't be so bad, but it's all throughout. This is the only set that seems to have this issue.

Ten seasons just isn't enough, and unlike many shows it doesn't get mundane or redundant. Each episode is a new adventure. With every season you fall more and more in love with each quirky character-- Monica and her obsessiveness, Joey and his charm (and dim wittedness), Rachel and her prissiness, Ross and his nerdiness, Phoebe and her peculiarities, and Chandler and his cheesy humor. You grow to love each in their own way and think of them as your own friends. They'll be there for you.",1465776000,2,608,4.638888888888889

Amazon is sending me a second replacement at no additional cost to me.

Second Replacement:
Same problem with the same disc in the series; Season 8 Disc 1, different notification though...  ""Error Disc""
It's the part where Rachel reveals she's pregnant and I can't watch it because the manufacturer was drunk when they put this set together.
Called amazon. I asked if I ordered Season 8 on DVD would they refund me. They agreed. Let's hope that disc one in this Season 8 isn't defective too!

I'm glad she made me wait, I saved a lot of money, hahah.

 The box set is great. I know with large whole series like this some people have defective discs, so I am carefully watching each DVD to check. So far all the DVDs are fine, I checked the discs themselves and saw no scratches and all the numbers are right. I'm mid-season 2 in watching and so far everything is great.

The packaging itself is really nice and sturdy. I really like the individual seasons too because you can take one case with you and it just looks like if you bought the stand alone season. The menus are cool, the special features are cool.

Unless one of the discs is defective and I haven't found it yet (I'll update this if and when I do), I give it all an A+. Totally worth the $75ish for the whole series.",1463702400,2,1118,4.068181818181818

After settling that one I decided to pay more and go through Amazon.  I trusted that Amazon would not have pirated anything.  Unfortunately I purchased this too long ago to get a refund but I just discovered an entire episode missing.  It goes from Ross and everyone leaving to go to the hospital for the birth of his son to the one of them all looking at photos of his son.  The one of the actual birth of Ben is not on the disk at all. I don't know if other episodes are missing as it is rare I watch anything.  Very disappointed.

How am I sure of this you ask? Because A) I'm a huge fan and B) since I've watched it over and over on my box set and when it was on television when I watched it on Blu Ray on some episodes there are certain scenes that are cut short. Not dramatically but in a way that to me isn't good because it may change your opinion on certain characters. Like example: SPOILERS ALERT:

Marcel was Ross's pet capuchin monkey, during season one The episode Marcel repeatedly plays In the jungle from the Lion King Soundtrack Ross seems to get annoyed and the scene ends.. in the original scene Ross, Chandler and Joey start dancing to the music eating pizza and the scene ends.

People that watch it for the first time might see Ross as easily annoyed and no fun...but in the original aired episode and on the regular DVD box sets you see the fun side of the guys in the scene :)",1456012800,,1034,4.243654822335025

The packaging is excellent, and the booklet is just too cool. The special features are many, but I have to say I was disappointed to see that the episodes differ from the the dvd extended episode versions. All of the extra dialogue/scenes I was used to seeing threw me off when I assumed it would appear on blu ray as well. I guess Warner Bros. felt it would be too generous to off the extended episodes on blu ray, so I may keep my dvd's as well. Also the pilot feature alternate takes that differ from the dvd version. There is some roughness to the pilot, but the rest of the episodes look wonderful and the they greatly compliment my new 4K Ultra HD TV",1455148800,,780,4.172185430463577
1173367,4,985357456X,"I love Friends. I can recite large chunks of dialogue of Friends. I've seen every episode a hundred times and was lucky enough to see most of the series first run. (I started watching at season 5, when I was still in high school.) So obviously, when the DVDs were released, I owned them all. Every season. And all those episodes were the director's cut with about 2-3 minutes of extra footage. Terrific gags, great one liners, and dialogue that added clarity to the scenes. I had memorized those episodes. Then they released the bluray set, and I asked for it for Christmas without reading reviews or doing research. I sold all my old DVDs to Hastings. And then I realized....these are the original episodes, edited for TV! Ugh! Agh! No! ...Yes. It's terrible. I can watch any episode and tell exactly what's missing. Sometimes it's lines that I'd really loved. I think this is why I don't watch the show as much anymore. It's depressing! And in most cases the picture quality seems only marginally better than the DVDs. Had I known, I'd have never upgraded. In fact, I keep thinking about down grading and buying all the seasons back on DVD. That's how much it sucks that they didn't include the DVD format episodes that many of us were used to when the released this set. I'm actually bummed out just thinking about it now.

So my rating is only so high because I don't want people to think I hated the show. Five stars to the show. 2 stars--mostly for packaging and the insert episode guide--to this lousy bluray set. :(",1455062400,,1523,4.5583941605839415

1173405,5,985357456X,"UPDATE: Jan 2016

Cracked the code on the issue about some episodes being ""2 min long clips."" In the episode menu of every disk, there is a coffee mug bullet point be each episode listed. If you accidentally click on the mug ((instead of the title)) to select the episode you wish to watch, you will instead be shown a brief clip from the episode. To be clear, click coffee mug bullet point icon thingy for clips. Click title of the episode to view the episode. Problem solved!!!!!

Just received the DVD set in the mail this week! I cannot yet confirm that all disks play well. I can, however say that all 40 disks arrived intact. I've flipped through and checked each one to insure none were missing or duplicated.

Initial Impression:
The box arrived in perfect condition (it's the blue and white box edition). I had no damage to the cardboard box that holds all of the DVD cases what-so-ever. Each Season is in its own respective DVD case within the box. That's a total of 10 cases.

Features of note:

I believe each season (not episode necessarily) has an optional voice over feature with commentary from the 3 writers of the show offering insight and tid-bits about the show. Upon opening the box set, my husband and I (both big fans) noticed this feature and decided to listen to the commentary offered on disc one. It was actually very interesting!

The last disk of each season has a friend's trivia feature built into the menu. We haven't gotten to experience this but I think it's a cool idea and I like that it is built into the disk content rather than a book (which could get damaged) that is separate from the disks. I think the red box set was like that. Just more stuff to have around.

Overall, it's a very clean looking set! We're working on becoming more minimalistic and had planned to scan the disks into hard drive storage eliminating the need for the physical set BUT the set is such a nice package! It's a show piece. I want this baby out in the open! It makes me smile and gives me a warm fuzzy feeling that makes me think I'm going to hold onto it in its entirety. Ah, the joy of friends! Once this arrives at your home, you will instantly know what I mean!

If you know a superfan that doesn't own the series or maybe they could just use a new, consolidated set, this makes an terrific gift! I wish we new someone that's as big of fans as we are yet doesn't already own the full series that we could buy this for. We purchased this as a Christmas gift to each other because it's always nice to have a this bubbly, sunny show. Rainy day? Bad day? Break out Friends and bring on the laughs! This is a quality set. Nothing bootleg about it. I can't get over the qualify for the price. I bet this was around $250 when the show initially ended.

One last point I want to make....yes, you can watch Friends on Netflix now. We watched 4 or 5 seasons through Netflix. The series as offered on Netflix is not complete. It is the edited for TV version which is shortened for commercial time frames (which is how the show was originally aired.) A lot of very funny content and great lines are extracted throughout each episode in these shortened versions. THIS SET, however, offers the uncut version of the show which is also what was offered on on the original DVDs of the seasons which were available for individual purchase. As mentioned by others, the ""blue-ray"" isn't true blue-ray but perhaps a higher contrast ""enhanced"" version. The blue-ray is also the cut version of the show. It wasn't worth it to me and I chose to go with the DVD version.

I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm impressed with the presentation of the set and it exceeds my expectations. If I experience issues with the playing quality of the disks that others have described, I will update this review. So far, everything is perfect! I don't have any criticisms at all!",1449705600,29,3865,4.430985915492958

One of them I can live with, and one of them drives me absolutely insane. First, the Blu Ray quality leaves  lot to be desired, The video is very grainy. I can live with that, though. The major issue is that these are not full episodes. That is absolutely inexcusable for a ""complete series"". That is false advertising. This is three quarters of a series at best. The whole point of having this collection, for me, is having the complete uncut episodes in HD. The complete seasons on DVD that many of us have include the full unedited episodes. I thought I was getting the same thing, but on Blu Ray. Not the case. Some of these are even shorter than their respective tv airings. They don't just cut parts of scenes or a few lines here and there, they cut entire scenes, and it's some of the best material of the episode.

I didn't go for a Blu Ray due to many comments and validation that it doesn't have extended scenes. This was on my To-do list whenever I visited US as it was cost effective. When I brought it back to India and eagerly unpacked it and put it in my Blu Ray player it gives me an error of region lock. Why would you do that Warner?Why?why? Now I have a turkey on my hands that's from a different country and cost a few doubloons.,1443139200,,533,3.9906542056074765

1173479,5,985357456X,Now i got this for christmas for 70$. None of the episodes are cut. Now i've seen people saying that the blu-ray version is cutts the episodes up and i just find that so funny. If you bought the blu-ray version go review that not this version. This is the best 70$ i've ever spent. i was born in 1998 and alot of these episodes i never knew existed and it's so sad what they cut in tv. I've been watching Friends ever sence i can remember and now i have this fantastic box set. There's alot of very funny out takes aka Gag Reals. on the last disc on season 10 the outakes from season 10 i wanted to watch that so i hit play and before the outakes start there's a very special thing right before it. Conan O'Brien invites you to the gag real and being a huge Conan fan i was so happy. Incase you didn't know the people who makes the Funko things well coming at sometime there will be Funko Friends. Can't wait till that. Friends the complete series box set we have here is a fantastic buy if you wait untill Christmas sales you can get this so much cheaper.,1436659200,,1056,4.106280193236715
1173480,3,985357456X,"This is a decent series.  They were all attractive individuals with little talent, genius, or passion, but managed to succeed.  It was lighthearted entertainment.  And it kept being lighthearted, though the characters faced some difficulties, they always bounced back.  It was delightful though not all the characters were likable.

In fact, almost all the characters were unlikable.  Monica Gellar/Courtney Cox is hyper-competitive and neurotic - and not in a fun way.  I personally thought she was more attractive than her best friend, though Rachel Green received most of the attention.  Rachel Green/Jennifer Anniston is shallow and dense, but she had a certain ditziness and misguided sense of purpose, which made her think she was better than she was but also, very attractive to men.  Phoebe/Lisa Kudrow - my least favorite character - is annoying, obnoxious, and never funny.

And as bad as the female characters are, the male characters are worse.  Chandler/Matthew Perry - probably the most sympathetic male character - is a coward; just a better looking version of George Constanza from Seinfeld.  Aside from looks, there is little difference between them.  They are both obnoxious, callous, indifferent beings.  Ross Gellar/David Schwimmer is arrogant, annoying, and morally bankrupt.  I like Joey/Matthew LeBlanc - he is a cad, but of all the actors, he is the most capable, because he manages to make Joey likable, though he is barely recognizable as a human being.

I personally hated Rachel and Ross getting together in the end.  I thought Rachel could do better, and that Ross deserved a bitter horrible person.  I just could never warm up to him.  Though I've heard that producers were overwhelmed with requests that Rachel and Ross get together.  I privately hope they do not last.  And I hope this time Rachel cheats, and stays away.  That they had a baby, I understand.  But Ross - insecure, jealous, condescending - he is despicable.  He is always sorry, but he forces himself on others, he is abusive, and I just really disliked him.

This is a great series.  The cast had astounding charisma, on par with those on Seinfeld.  They were individually unlikable but together, they managed to find the right sympathetic tone.  They are all good actors, and it's a shame that Courtney Cox was never nominated for an Emmy.  She was my personal favorite but I'm sure I'll receive ridicule for that choice.

I have criticized all the actors and it is true - I would run away from all of them in real life.  But in terms of entertainment - my loyalties changed, my sympathies were swayed, but always, I laughed at them.",1436572800,,2633,4.942922374429224

The special features disc at the end also has some content that die-hard friends fans have probably seen, such as the behind the scenes featurettes that they did a few seasons in and at the end of the series.

I love Friends, I grew up watching the show. So I was beyond excited to see this package come out.

The package is beautiful and they upped the quality, but I couldn't get over not having that extra footage.  The Friends: Complete Series Boxed DVD Set is what I ended up purchasing, DVDs, the quality isn't as good, but I get all those moments that I love. And its also nicely packaged.

All of the disks are in a handy cardboard book and there is a separate booklet of episode descriptions and they both fit neatly into the box with a magnetic closure.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the quality of the video is still slightly grainy.  I'm sure that is to be exptected when you take a show from the 90s and attempt to make it HD quality.  It is a huge step above the DVDs that I also own and I am noticing so many more details that I never noticed before with the increased clarity.,1429228800,,565,3.9734513274336285
1173539,2,985357456X,"I have the DVD box set and wanted to upgrade to Blu-ray so I bought this. In the very first episode, I noticed there were lines missing and as I went on, entire scenes missing. I looked it up and it turns out that the Blu-ray has the shows exactly as they are run on TV whereas the DVD has about 3 min of additional footage per episode. Doesn't seem like much, but that equates to about 12 hours of footage over the entire series. I tried to just live with that, but I'm so used to the DVDs that it's painfully obvious when they cut out a line or a scene and it just doesn't seem right without it. So, if you've only ever watched the show as it aired and/or in syndication, I would recommend this box set over the DVD because it's higher quality and fewer discs. If however, you are considering upgrading from the DVD box set, I would NOT recommend this as you will, in my opinion, miss the deleted scenes that that didn't include in this Blu-ray set.",1429228800,32,951,4.173913043478261

As with all box sets, you might take note that this is one large package without individual cases, so finding a place in your blu ray shelf to place this might be a bit difficult, but overall I have nothing bad to say about this.

As a huge Friends fan, I have had many a marathon with my dvds, so I know the episodes practically scene for scene, line for line.

When you take the cover off, the discs are organized nicely in a box with magnetic lid. There are also more episodes on each disc, so there are less discs overall. The sound quality is superb, and the picture quality is definitely improved. However, I don't like how they've edited many of the episodes, cutting out content that was in the original DVD set. This makes me upset that I got rid of the DVD's in the first place. The audio and picture upgrades really aren't worth the extra, because you're losing content.

On a couple episodes we have watched, the picture sometimes randomly starts skipping while audio is fine. This, so far, has been easily resolved by stopping and restarting episode. My biggest complaint right now is that the outer box (with the moving when tilted picture of the cast) arrived damaged, but not from shipping. The hinge edge is completely torn, still connected, but torn along the whole edge. It is also damaged along one of the other edges. Everything was sealed in undamaged plastic wrap and supposedly ""new"", so I have a hard time understanding how this damage that looks like it is from repetitive opening and closing of the box was done.

1173662,5,985357456X,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!,1421452800,,21,3.4
1173663,4,985357456X,"As a series, I would give ""Friends"" 5 stars.  I watched all the episodes on TV and collected the series on DVD as each season was originally released.  The show is so funny -- well written and well acted, and I have watched every episode probably dozens of times now.

I received this Blu-ray set for Christmas, after much hemming and hawing about whether to buy it for myself since I already had the entire series on DVD.

The good:  The picture is great.  After watching reruns shown on TV in high definition, my standard definition DVDs were looking pretty sad.  The series holds up and is legitimately fun to watch.

The bad:  No extended episodes.  This is mentioned in tons of reviews, so I knew it going into the blu-ray set and decided it did not outweigh the positive features of this blu-ray set.  But it is disappointing, when I now know the extended episodes better than the original versions.  As I watch these episodes it feels like something is missing.  It's not a major problem, but I think it's weird that the extended scenes weren't included.

The ugly:  I really hate the packaging of this set.  It comes in a black collector's box, and inside that is a folio that holds all the discs, as well as a book that has the episode details.  First off, the box is large and relatively flat, so it doesn't fit on a standard DVD shelf.  I mean, it DOES fit, but not in the way that 10 seasons of DVDs fit.  You would have to put it on the shelf with the front (or back, I guess, if you want) facing out, unless your shelf is much deeper than a typical DVD case, so then width-wise it is going to take up a lot more space.  At my house, DVD space is at a premium and getting smaller all the time, so it's somewhat troublesome to have this take up so much space on the shelf.  Also, this box set is heavy and shifted around a lot in the shipping box from Amazon, because it was not packed securely.  As a result, the corners of the collector's box are prone to breaking.  I received a total of three shipments of this item from Amazon in an attempt to get one in pristine condition.  All of them had broken corners on the collector's box, and I ended up keeping the least broken of the three.  If this is something that matters to you, I'd suggest buying it locally rather than having it shipped.",1421452800,2,2305,4.292343387470997

Granted, I am watching on a computer (HTPC). But every other Blu-Ray disk I watch on the computer has wonderful picture quality.  So what happened here.  Really seems like they loaded the Blu-Ray disks with the DVD version.

1173731,5,985357456X,"I am going to try and keep this brief...I actually didn't buy this last year after reading the reviews that this set doesn't have the extended versions of the episodes.  My wife and I being die-hard FRIENDS fans, we completely understand as we find ourselves, when watching, noticing when scene's have been cut short, dialogue is missing, etc.  That being said, those reasons are really stupid reasons not to buy this set if you a fan of the show.  The box is beautiful, both the inner and outer magnetically close, the book that comes with it is really great, giving the title, dates that the episode aired, and a brief synopsis. The bonus Blu Ray disc is awesome (check out the Gag reel!).

So.... as I would also like to see the extended versions on Blu Ray at some point, it's kind of like how we all own multiple ( I think I have 3 or 4) sets of the original Star Wars trilogy.  We all like the originals, but the Blu Ray versions that Lucas edited are also good, interesting and different. After seeing an interview with Kevin Bright and listening to him explain that those extra parts aren't really needed I thought I'd get it and see. This is a great set and it's really great quality.  Grab at $100 bucks.  It's totally worth it!",1419638400,2,1238,4.427312775330397

1173764,5,985357456X,"What is there to say about Friends? If you love the series but don't yet own it, this is the set to get. It has all ten seasons WITH the extra footage in every episode, and the episodes are in order by season so you can watch the series from pilot to finale. Yes, it is on DVD and yes, it is in the regular TV aspect ratio (not widescreen), but for me, this was an easy trade off for the extra scenes. I could have bought the Bluray set that is in extra clear HD and is also in widescreen, but the Bluray set has the episodes as they originally aired, without the extra scenes. I would have missed out on the extra scenes, some of which contain jokes that are very funny. I previously owned some of the 4-disc season sets, so I'm used to watching the series with the extra bits, and I would very much have missed them. This set also has similar packaging to the individual sets; each season is 4 discs in a plastic case which all fit into the larger cardboard box. The cover of each case is the same as the individual season sets, and the insert has the same description of every episode on each disc, which is really handy if you are trying to find a specific episode or scene. In fact, the disc contents are the same as the individual season sets, so if you already own all of those, you won't get anything new with this. If, like me, you own some seasons but not all, this set will feel nicely familiar and will fill in the gaps. If you haven't seen the extra bits and would rather have stunning clarity, go with the Bluray discs. For me, DVD was far and away the right choice.",1417996800,21,1580,4.133116883116883

Each dvd season comes with an episode guide and really awesome images. At the 4th disc of each season, there is a trivia game. There are extra things within every disc. Quite exciting and runs very smoothly on both a disc and mac. If you have never seen the series ""Friends"" before, I suggest watching it.

It also has bonus episodes like ""The One with the Rumor"" which featured Brad Pitt. This was a really great episode and it's quite possibly my favorite episode in the entire series.

When I popped the first DVD in, it mostly worked, with a little bit of a hiccup. The second DVD froze about halfway through, the third DVD froze after the first episode and on and on it went. I didn't return it because I'd never done that before and didn't know the process (I figured it out later, but it was out of the time that I could return it). My guess is these were ripped DVDs and unauthorized to play in the US, it's the only thing that makes sense. Sucks to be me.

I immediately noticed that lines and whole scenes had been cut from the bluray set. It seems as if they were trying to condense and fit everything onto 2 blurays per season. For example, the scene after Ross finds out that Rachel likes him, where Ross and Julie are looking at cats, that whole scene is cut out. I've noticed several lines cut out as well. Huge disappointment. Yes the quality is nice, but for a show mostly based on dialogue, I'd rather have all the content. Quite annoyed and dissapointed. Shouldnt the blurays have more?! not less of the DVD content?!?",1410134400,2,807,4.416107382550336

The series itself gets an uplift from the DVD version picture-wise and everything looks much better here though don't expect movie-like remaster treatment. Very nice overall.

The box itself is a strong box and won't bend that easily, it also is easy to access each season and remove them easily.

I would recommend this box set to any fan of Friends, it has tons of extra features and it shows the entire episodes. My only complaint is that the music can be loud and the talking is kind of quiet but it is still a great set and really showcases this great show well.",1410048000,2,830,4.1875

But when it was a recent Deal of the Day for under 90 bucks, it was too good to pass up. I'm so glad I didn't!  It's a very nice package with secure slots for all discs, and they all arrived in perfect shape and all play flawlessly.  The sound and HD picture are fantastic, and they did a great job of formatting the picture for HD format. Lots of extras, many special features, a very nice book detailing the episodes. Great stuff.

As for the content, it's Friends. I know many fans who've chimed in here are unhappy because the DVD versions have extra material, and I can understand that.  But as someone who loves the show but never got the DVD's, this blu ray set fits the bill.  It's all there, everything we originally saw and loved, WENUS included!

For example, the regular friends dvd box sets have the option of clicking on the coffee cup and you were able to watch the whole episode.  this bluray set only shows you what was seen while they aired on tv.  we miss little things, like for example, in the where Ross, Rachel, and Chandler are moving the couch up the stairs and eventually they get the couch jammed and the fire alarm went off you see people from the building started jumping over the couch to get down the stairs.  this whole seen is no where on this box set.",1407888000,26,765,4.135135135135135

But if you don't see an update, assume they, too, were perfect.

If you're a fan of the show, this is perfect for you.
The box set comes with all DVDs, bonus features, and bloopers.
Normally, I see this for around $100-$120, so having it for less than $100 is a bargain.

Shipping Review:
It arrived in about 3 days so shipping time was no issue.
It's a relatively large box that has all 10 seasons in DVDs.
Because of this, shipping can be tricky so my box arrived with dents at the top.
This did NOT affect the DVDs, the DVD cases or anything, just the appearance of the box.

Overall, this was money well spent.

1174004,1,985357456X,"A show about 6 people who never seem to work a day in their life, but  manage to afford to live in New York City. When one of them does have a job, say, in that coffee shop, it seems the rest of the gang hang out there all day too, not working... must be one heck of a high paying barrister job to afford to get by on?... oh, OK, they all live together, so that makes it right... that only one of them ever seems to work, someone must have left one of them a large amount of money in their will I take it?

The acting is overrated. Matt LeBlonkhead has to be one of the worst actors of all time. Nothing he ever says is funny, and his character just got more annoying over time the more sarcastic he got. Funny stuff alright. sigh. Phoebe, a typical stereo type blonde, irritating at most. I do not find her stupid personality funny, nor ever found anything remotely funny about singing about a stinking cat. Chandler, the female version of Phoebe... will they eventually tie the knot? I don't care to see Dumb and Dumber wed. Rachel and Monica... which one is which again? Not that it matters.

I know a lot of people loved this show, but I'm entitled to my opinion to hate it. Just remember if you're going to hit the comment button, try to be more original than saying something idiotic and illogical like, ""You must have no f.r.i.e.n.d.s"", ""You must not like comedy"", ""I wasted time investigating what else you reviewed and must say I think blah blah blah""... accept the fact someone can't stand this show and get over it.",1401235200,5,1526,4.291666666666667
1174005,5,985357456X,"I've watched Friends religiously since it first came to NBC back in 1994 until the series finale. It was part of my Thursday night ritual and I rarely missed an episode (don't forget this was before DVR's and TIVO).
Yes these are the episodes as they originally aired and not the extended versions that were on the DVD seasons, but you really don't miss it. There are couple of episodes where you feel like there was something missing and you can't quite put your finger on it, but the episodes don't feel incomplete when the end credits roll.
If you're a fan of the show and feel the price is worth getting all 10 seasons, by all means get this Blu-ray set. You won't be disappointed.
I have been watching this almost daily and I am on season eight. I'm holding off watching the special features disc until I have seen all the episodes. So I can't comment on that just yet.

The only negative thing I can say, and I remember reading this in other reviews, sometimes if you fast forward or rewind, the picture gets ""jittery"" when play resumes. I'm fairly certain this will only happen on some Blu Ray players, but I figured out how to avoid this. Of course there is the obvious: don't fast forward or rewind, but if you must, (I have a Sony 3D Blu Ray player and this worked every time) I hit the home button then play again, and the picture was fine and it also picked up right where I left off. A little annoying, but not a deal breaker.

Sound and picture quality are great! And the special features are pretty good. Just don't expect to see any ""Where are they now?"" documentaries.",1401062400,3,1585,4.387755102040816

Her birthday came around so this was a gift for her so she can watch the whole series again from start to finish and not miss a thing. A fair amount of extras are included on the discs but not by today's standards. I've heard this set includes extra footage that has been removed from the Blu-Ray edition which is a bonus but watching the DVD on a Blu-Ray screen isn't the best thing (unless I'm missing a setting to fix that somehow) so we fortunately have the old DVD player and the giant rear projection TV in the spare room to re-watch as we saw it way back when.

1174019,3,985357456X,"I've never seen Friends on actual TV. Back then I just wasn't into it.

But then I got converted and watched the American Extended DVD Edition over and over again. And on top of that I've got a pretty good memory.

And while the 16:9 picture is really well done I've already stumbled multiple times in the Pilot alone because there was missing a piece like the gang fake-dubbing the Spanish TV program or Joey going after Chandler because he mocked his Pinocchio performance.

As someone who knows the key episodes in their extended version basically by heart, it's like an audio CD with a few scratches and the music suddenly jumps in the middle of the track.

So, if you only know the broadcast version or can't basically sync-speak the dialogue then this may be for you, but me? I'm disappointed because quite frankly I didn't anticipate this.

PS:
I've just measured it and compared to the red US DVD box with the extended episodes there's a running time difference of 308 minutes (just the episodes, no extras!). That makes an average of 1 minte, 18 seconds less per episode compared to the extended episodes or roughly 31 minutes per season.

PPS: I've figured out why they used the broadcast version: They wanted to just press one version for all markets. The set includes the German dubbing and said dubbing was only created for the broadcast version. Otherwise they would have to re-cut the audio dub and insert subtitles for the missing pieces.",1398988800,6,1454,4.7047244094488185

The other issue I have with these discs is that they aren't in order of season. They just come stuck in these flimsy cardboard boxes that don't hold up the more you take them in & out of the boxes.

But some of the booklets have an extra DVD that doesn't have a proper cut out place to tuck into and have to ""float"" at the back of the booklet. Also, the episodes are labelled #1, 2, 3 and so on so there is no distinguishing between seasons, nor is there any name of the episodes listed. We had to Google for a list of episode names so we could find episodes we wanted when we sat down to watch it. Would've been a lot easier if it had them printed out on the booklet instead of so many pictures of the actors faces.
Once the DVD goes in you the episodes are listed and there is no problem with the quality of the DVDs at all. So that's why I give it 3 stars.",1392854400,2,819,3.8520710059171597

Then I noticed that they repackaged the ""complete collection"" in a white background with each character's face in a circle. Inside it is carefully packed with each individual season in its own plastic case(as if you bought each season individually). It was a smart way to package the series and I couldn't be more pleased. Each disc is safe and secure without the scratches from the cardboard cases others wrote about. This is a great series filled with lots of laughter and fun.

I don't think you need to read a review of Friends. If you don't know the show, the only reason you'd buy the Complete Series is if you're getting it for a friend, and so this is a perfect buy.

I will say that the episode menu is really annoying with this set. There's this little coffee-cup icon next to each episode title, and if you hit that you end up watching an episode summary, rather than the episode. I'm not sure why they decided to do that, but these DVDs are kind of old (back in the day when they did weird things with menu selections, cause someone, somewhere, thought it was nifty).",1390694400,,793,4.28

Unfortunately the ""complete"" series is a misnomer since they cut lines out of each show. I did save one of the individual season box set and confirmed a portion of a scene is missing. Why they would do this is insane and disappointing. If I can tell a line is missing, it was clearly memorable. I would love to contact the people responsible for the distribution (I believe it is still Warner Brothers) and get my money back. I feel like this was marketed under false pretense. If you are an average Friends fan, then it is a nice gift or set to have on hand but those of us who grew up watching the series may feel they got cheated out of 3 minutes from each show.",1390435200,3,831,4.2594936708860756

Amazing purchase. The red box edition had the discs in sleeves--some discs were even doubled up in one sleeve. They were easily damaged and all together the packaging was extremely disappointing.

1174163,1,985357456X,"Studios and production companies have a history of poor edits, poor re-releases, gouging consumers etc...while I support the right of any company to do business however they choose, I will say for the record, this blu-ray set is a blatant attempt to monetize the fond memories so many of us have of this show. To cut out between 2 and 4 minutes per episode of a show that tons of people have memorized seems particularly egregious given the ease with which they could have left those minutes intact. I waited for months after they announced they were putting out the full series in HD and I was thrilled about the transition. My original DVD copies are a bit beat up from extended use, and the older seasons just don't look good on my flat screen. Oh well I guess. After watching a few episodes with a friend who did buy the blu rays, I was incredibly disappointed to realize they'd cut some of the best lines in the series. They won't be getting my money, and I would suggest you don't give them yours either.",1386892800,8,1010,4.464864864864865

You get all 10 seasons in slim cases, 4 discs per case.  Each disc is labeled with the season & disc number, so there is no confusion as with the earlier complete series release.  Even though Friends is rerun daily on Nick at Nite & TBS, I highly recommend buying this series because you can watch the show whenever you want.  Moreover, it comes in a beautiful box as pictured above, and the receiver of your gift will always be greatful to you.  All Friends fans should buy this set for Christmas.  The only issue I have is with the package carrier, Ontrac.  Hopefully the only reason I received the package at 5PM is just because its Christmas time.  LOVE!!

1174170,5,985357456X,"I was afraid of purchasing this collection (The White Box) during Cyber Monday because of the past reviews about faulty DVDs, etc. Well, my collection of discs were perfect and there wasn't any problem at all.

Something important to notice is that I'm talking about the new White Box released in 2013  and not the Red one (2006). That Red Box had some problems according to the reviews posted some years ago. Sadly, The White Box's amazon page appears as a New Item of the Red Box DVDs and this has made that comments and reviews are mixed in the White Box product page. So pay attention to the details if you want to get the right product here.

The White Box contains 10 separate boxes for every season with 4 discs per season. There's no a 60-page booklet at all as the previous release and this collection doesn't include the 2 music CD's with the soundtrack. However, the price is worth it for remembering good times. By the way, all episodes are presented in full-screen format and the quality is acceptable taking into consideration that this tv show was produced a long time ago. If you want high quality,however, think about purchasing the Blue-Ray collection.",1386460800,,1170,4.669902912621359

Each season is packaged in it's own case just as if purchased separately. I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend it. I made sure that my DVD series was sold by Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. It's been my experience (and I've purchased hundreds of DVD's through Amazon over the past several years) that if you buy from marketplace or third party sellers sometimes there are quality issues...I have NEVER had a quality issue when purchasing directly from Amazon LLC.

There are not 6 booklets or whatever else people were saying I received 10 boxes inside this white box with each box containing one season.

The discs are not scratched at all and I think that might be a problem if you buy it from some other seller but as long as you buy from amzaon your discs should be fine. Everything came in perfect and for the current price of $90 I don't see how you can beat this, unless they have a better deal on cyber monday.

I will update this with pictures (with a timestamp obviously) and also with my review of the picture quality on a HD TV because I have yet to try out the discs and watch yet. Until then though I see no reason why this could be any less than 5 stars. Purchase this with ease of mind there is nothing to worry about.

EDIT: I purchased this at $90 but it seems to be listed at $95 now. Still a great deal.",1385078400,23,1042,3.9523809523809526
1174191,1,985357456X,"I can't love ""Friends"" more than I do.  I own the DVD version of the Complete Series (all 10 seasons).  In this Blu-ray version, they have cut out the extended scenes.  The most hilarious parts of scenes are missing all together!  Not just a little.  A LOT!  I am totally disappointed.  They MUST redo the Blu-ray version to include all the extended scenes included in the DVD version.  This was an awful decision!!!  Horrible!  Warner Bros. what were you thinking?  You really botched this one!",1384992000,10,495,4.705882352941177
1174192,5,985357456X,I am so glad I bought these! I have watched them several times already. Great go-to show. It's a classic.,1384819200,,105,4.3
1174193,5,985357456X,Such a nice package of a favorite series. Loved this show when it was on TV and I love throwing in the DVDs on a quiet day at home to reminisce a bit. Always a lot of laughs and the six characters will remain as some of my all-time favorites.,1384732800,,242,3.86
1174194,4,985357456X,"The reviews high in the 'most helpful' queue emphasized problems with the package design and production quality, so I checked these right away, and see nothing to complain about.  This release has none of the exotic design features that people complained about in those reviews.  It looks just like the complete-series sets I purchased recently from Amazon for '24' and 'Buffy': each season in a separate standard four-disc plastic box, with a printed insert summarizing the episodes and the various special features for that season (commentary for selected episodes, blooper reel, etc.), all ten seasons in a uniform format with a fitted slipcase for the whole set.  No extras like a booklet or audio cd's.

Because of the many complaints about defective discs in those older reviews, I tested all 40 discs right away and they all looked clean and loaded normally.  For this test I used an older Magnavox VCR/DVD combo player with 480i resolution playing through a CRT tv, and they all played fine and looked normal for that display.

But then I saw that someone had complained just a couple of days ago about the quality of the resolution in this new release, so I tried a couple of these discs using a new RCA 32-inch 1080p flatscreen with built-in DVD player including 1080 upconversion, and then I could see what they are talking about.  Even on this HD tv with an upconverting DVD player, these discs seem to play at only 480i resolution.  I got the same result with an external upconverting Magnavox DVD player playing through this HD tv. This is in striking contrast with five other complete-series sets I recently purchased from Amazon, for ER, West Wing, Buffy, 24 and Northern Exposure.  All five of those show very striking improvements in resolution over the older 480i system when played on this HD tv through either of these upconverting DVD players, but these Friends DVD's do not.  For that reason I give this set 4 stars not 5, just as the preceding reviewer did.

So if you have an HD tv and care about resolution, you may want to spend the extra money to get this set in Blu-ray, which Amazon also offers.  In contrast, the other five sets I mentioned above are not currently offered by Amazon in Blu-ray.  A cynic might wonder whether this set was perhaps deliberately produced using some ""480i-only"" disc format which does not allow 1080i-upconversion, so as to generate additional demand for the more expensive Blu-ray release of the same series package.  Or, less cynically, maybe they assumed that anyone with an HD tv would also have a Blu-ray player and would always be buying the Blu-ray version of anything that was offered in both DVD and Blu-ray formats, so that the DVD version did not need to have whatever it is that allows this upconversion for these other five series sets which are offered only in a DVD format.

But that leaves no room for people like me, who have an HD tv but no Blu-ray player yet, and who value the 1080-upconversion as I found it on these other five sets.  If some DVD formats allow this upconversion and others do not, it would be nice for this to be somehow labeled in advance.  Right now, based on these six examples, all we have is this pattern that for five cases where there was no competing Blu-ray version the DVD's allowed HD-upconversion, while for this one case where there is also a competing Blu-ray release, the DVD's appear not to allow HD-upconversion.",1384732800,2,3427,4.7327731092436975

1174197,4,985357456X,"I just read an interview on tvguide with executive producer/director Kevin S. Bright about the blu ray sets. He did address the lack of extended episodes and he never once said that it would have been difficult or impossible to do. He merely stated that with the DVD sets, they were trying to give you more bang for the buck, but that this set is more about seeing the episodes again in a new way. That being said, I do wish they had included the extended shows, or provided an option where you could watch either the network version or the longer version. Some of the new scenes were very good and helped with the story telling.

The episodes I've watched do look great, and there doesn't seem to be any cropping issues with the transfer to a wide screen format. The packaging is very cool, with a 3D-style image on the box and a very nice episode guide booklet inside. The box unfolds and has a nifty magnetic lock. It will look awesome in your home media collection, even though it's an odd size.

I'm hoping that Seinfeld gets the same treatment someday soon.",1384473600,6,1063,4.446153846153846
1174198,4,985357456X,"For years I intermittently watched the Friends series on TV in different stations. I am sure I watched some episodes for more than three times but not sure which one I missed. I hope to have my own Friends complete series and placed the order when the set was on sale in Amazon recently.

The order was in two-day shipping but arrived one day earlier in surprise. The DVD set is brand new, and packed safely for shipping. I cannot wait to watch and finished the first disk (total 40 in 10 DVD folders) at one time. The disk looks great and plays well with no problem (based on one disk and I would expect the rest are perfect too, otherwise I will update here). I am very happy to watch the favorite movies episode by episode, instead of interrupted by ads on TV.

I would give 5 stars since I like it. However, as the movies on DVD, the picture quality (resolution) is not as I expected. The DVD set should be made after 2004, right? Could it be made in higher picture quality? For this reason, I had to remove a star.

Update 01/15/2014. I am slow, but seriously, I just finished the 6th Season, Disk 4. Had anyone had once watched ""The one with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E, the first episode on this disk? Below are some scenes in this episode. Is this a messed one? Could I remove a star because of this disk?

6th Season, Disk 4: The one with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E: The replay of Joey scene on the TV... Monica prepares food, the guy in her back talks ""I like it dirty, dirty...""... Rachel quits her job... Phoebe massage on Rachel's boyfriend... Ross's sandwich... Chandler talks to the duck and chick about the moving... Chandler takes message for Joey's audition, Joey missed, since he is going to meet Monica's parents... Chandler plays foosball with Joey... Joey and Chandler talks about Chandler's kiss with his sister... Joey's girlfriend comes with Janice. Joey is locked in the furniture, everything in the apt is gone. Ross, Chandler and Joey talk about Joey's pants measuring... Ross fight with Rachel for the unfinished 18-page front&back letter. Monica and Rachel flick, fight, Phoebe drags both's ears... Joey wear all of Chandler's clothes. Joey plays pingpong, Chandler comes back with two Joey's special pizzas. Chandler gets the message for Joey again. Chandler and Joey hug too much (good)... Is this The one with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E?

Update 01/16/2014. I had missed this episode on TV before, thanks to BHM in the comment for confirming the flashback structure. Was it too much flashback in this episode, making people lost in The One with What and WHAT? Anyway, let me give the star back.",1384473600,3,2605,4.642082429501085

The reason given by WB is that those were special for DVD and can't be done again for Blu-Ray.  That's total bull squirt.  If they could be done for DVD, they could be done for Blu-Ray.  WB chose not to do them, most likely with eyes toward a double-dip on people's wallets down the road.  I know the DVD versions by heart, and even when I watch the occasional syndicated version on television I know exactly when something has been cut, and it pretty much always makes the episode worse.  I refuse to let them keep my money for this set, and will not make a purchase until they do it correctly with the extended episodes.

1174205,5,985357456X,"The quality on these blu rays is amazing, details you didn't notice before are there, and because its widescreen, things on the sides are much more noticeable, especially easter eggs.

i think we all know they made the blu ray version for tv, they make a lot of money on making friends in hd widescreen, you wouldn't see any of those extra parts on tv anyway. However, yes, all of us are disappointed when comparing it to the dvds, rightfully so, since they didn't put a disclaimer on the blu rays that it was just the tv edits. But to them ""Friends"" is the tv version, and the dvd extra lines were just that, extras.

I don't think this is something they will fix for a blu ray only re-release.

BUT ... they do have to make yet another trip back to the original film to make the 4k versions of friends.

Now i know today, 11-12-2013 netflix is barely testing 4k video streaming, and tv providers only have a very minimal selection of 4k channels/videos, but 3-4 years down the road its going to be common enough for companies to start porting over their old shows for playing on netflix, tv stations and selling them on 4k disks (bluray can do this as of today, but only on large capacity disks, $$$).

So while we're all disappointed today, and will be for at least 2-3 more years, The technology for this process is just going to get faster and higher quality every year.

So a little patience... and possibly some reminder emails to the staff in charge of this stuff, or the nice people that made friends who might have a say in it. And possibly some emails headed towards Netflix, im sure being the only place to get 4k friends for awhile would be a handy ticket for them, if the episodes had all the dialogue, ... i wouldnt hate them if they added in a few extra scenes in this pass either =).

FYI nothing would stop them from making a 2nd blu ray set at that point (from the 4k video), and i'd be ok with buying a 2nd blu ray set, but only because i understand what happened. they didn't go back to get us a blu ray set, they went back to get a tv set, and just gave us the option to buy that tv set.",1384214400,2,2109,4.218362282878412

There are six disc jackets which fit a handful of dvds each, adding up to a total of 40 discs. But as any friends fan knows, there are 10 seasons, not 6! So it may bother some people that the seasons do not each have their own separate disc jacket.

I originally watch this series on the DVD edition, the true ""complete"" editions, that contained all the none edited footage. So to my dismay, after paying close to $200, this set kept leaving out scenes I knew we're there. The reviews for this set, which I didn't read until after I bought this set unfortunately, warned me not get it. Too late :(. It's only the stunted versions of each episode that aired on TV. Also it is in wide screen format, which is great because they boasted that Friends was originally recorded that way, but all they did was zoom in to get that effect, removing even more than the TV versions. You would think that after that much wait and that much of a cost, NBC would produce a ""full"" collection, but again we are the victims of the corporate greed machine. So do yourself a favor and get the DVD editions that say bonus footage because video quality is that of a DVD, not Bluray so you won't be missing in that department.

The only thing about this set of BlueRay disks that I don't like is that my Sony GoogleTV Disc player is not able to read the titles on the episodes and so it makes it really difficult to tell which episode I am on while viewing a disc.

Then there's other reviews stating that the box is sturdy (the authentic collection is very sturdy and very well designed) indicating these reviewers have the authentic set.

There are 2 big giveaways to tell if the set you're thinking of purchasing is authentic or a bootleg- which are the different photo of Chandler on the box and the disc holder design.

I'm only on season 3 and am contemplating not even watching anymore of them. Great quality picture is not worth the sacrifice of so many amazing jokes and scenes.

1174283,4,985357456X,"As soon as I won an Amazon gift card in a raffle, I knew exactly what I was going to buy: FRIENDS on DVD! Friends is one of my favorite shows, and I hated how it was only on for two hours a day on regular television. Plus, I was too young to appreciate the show when it originally aired, and I knew that there were several episodes which I hadn't seen.

I read the reviews prior to purchasing the set, and knew that the sleeves that the discs came in ended up scratching them up so that they would skip around. Therefore, as soon as I got mine, I transferred all the discs to separate sleeves and put the Collector's Box up on a shelf somewhere. I've never had a problem with skipping discs, nor would I say I had any problems whatsoever playing the episodes at all. It does suck that this has to be done, but it was relatively inexpensive and not too difficult.

Now that I have the extended versions of the episodes, the commentaries, and all the gag reels, I can't go back to normal FRIENDS on TV! It's too obvious to me which scenes were cut out and what's missing.

I took off one star because finding an episode you want to watch is a rather tedious process: Each disc is numbered 1-40, which has nothing to do with which season or episodes are on each one. To find an episode I want to watch, I have to leaf through the booklet that came with the discs, flip to the episode I want, then flip around a few more pages to find out which disc it's on. The book is great, but an awkward size, and not meant to see so much use. Mine is already falling apart at the binding, even though I flip carefully because I'm trying to keep it in good shape.

Overall, the product is great, and gets the job done for those who want to watch all the FRIENDS seasons. If they wanted to improve their product, they should change the packaging so the discs don't skip as well as offer a simple leaflet that outlines the seasons/episodes on each disc. The booklet just isn't practical.",1362614400,3,1970,4.2175066312997345

I've had the entire DVD series for years - my husband actually ripped them for me so I could watch it from our media server (it's easier/faster than dealing with discs). I watch Friends every single day - it's on right now! When my husband heard that Friends was coming out on Blu-ray he surprised me with this HD version boxed set and I was so freaking excited I can't even-- it was so sweet of him! But I started noticing something was off about my episodes. Little parts or scenes, and quotes that I remember... were missing. I thought it was my memory, that they were on another episode or something. But there's this ONE quote I was positive was in S4 E2 because it had sparked a whole conversation between my husband and me that had led to us watching Star Trek (his favorite show) which I had NEVER seen before (yeah, I know) but it's now my new favorite show. But that small snip of a scene was gone! Just poof! So I came on here to see if anyone else had noticed any ""cuts"" and I found I was not alone and it wasn't just one but a tons of cuts! I am so, so, so, bummed about this. For the super fans of this show (who know every line, every scene) this is a huge no-no.  We would rather watch the standard (aka ""fuzzy"") edition than miss out on those great one-liners.

In the case of Star Wars, they claimed for the Original versions, in Friends they claim for the Extended Ones.

There are technical reasons available in the web that explains the rational behind not extended quality in specific scenes that could not be recreated (based on original sources).

Buy the DVD or the Blu-Ray accordingly with the available options and enjoy your choice. It's a shame to invest a lot of words trying to change something that nobody can change (there is no time machine to re-film additional scenes in high definition).

1174309,5,985357456X,"In the 1990s and early 2000s the two biggest comedies on TV were probably Friends and Seinfeld. Friends was aimed at the younger demographic, going for the viewers that were in their mid to late 20s. I actually never watched the series consistently when it was on the air. I was a senior in high school the year it began, so I just never really got into it and never appreciated how good it really was.

It was one of those shows like ER, where the cast was made up of relative no names, but unlike ER the cast stayed together for the entire run. I think that allowed the show to keep the same feel and tone throughout the series. The writing was very very good in that they allowed the characters to evolve and grow over the course of 10 years but never lost the core of who they were over that time. They also did a great job of referring to old jokes without (for the most part) making them stale. The ones that did, it got to the point that they would even poke fun at it (for example ""We were on a break""). I also liked how the show relied on more than just sex jokes for the comedies (unlike many of the sitcoms of today). While there were certainly sex jokes throughout the series, there were a lot smarter jokes in there too, that presumed the audience was smart enough to be entertained by other material.

One big drawback (for some) in this release is that the episodes were only the ones that were broadcast. Apparently the DVD sets included a lot of extended episodes, but this is just going to give you the show as it was intended to originally be seen. If that is a deal breaker for you, then don't waste the money. For those who do not see that as a big deal, the series looks and sounds great on Blu Ray and will make a great addition to your collection.",1358726400,,1771,4.190615835777126

You thought you could just slip it by and no one would notice? Who at Warner Brothers thought that this was exceptable to all the true fans of the series? Why does this happen???
We did not buy this set on Amazon, but instead, in our haste, purchased it locally missing out on all the reviews set forth before me. So thats shame on me.

Then responded saying the Extended footage wasn't available in a format that could benefit from a Blu-ray release. Bull, they just didn't want to spend the money & time to get the 35mm film for those scenes, rescan them in high definition & edit them back into the Broadcast versions that they already had complete masters for to use for syndication. If they can go back and rescan scenes that looked blurry on TV & look fantastic on the Blu-ray, they could have done the same with the extended scenes. I don't care what anyone says, the broadcast versions are not the ones we were ""Meant to see"". They were the ones we HAD to see due to time restrictions.

1174336,2,985357456X,"A lot of people are complaining about the missing extended material. I've never seen it, so I don't miss it. I bought the Blu-ray for two reasons. I really no longer care to watch anything in 4:3 format, and that's all that is availble on DVDs that I can find. Several people have said that's how it's filmed, but that's not true, in fact there is no such thing as a camera that shoots 4:3. They are all shot with normal film and cropped to 4:3 to fit the frame from the original broadcasts. So, the Blu-ray did give me a 16:9 picture and I am happy with that. However, Blu-ray is also about high definition, and again, the original footage is shot with very high definition film. But these cuts were not made from that film and there was absolutely no touch-up, filtering or editing done to bring the picture back to a HD picture. The pictures are grainy, contain many artifacts (brought about when you film a copy of a film) and the sound quality is poor. Bottom line, this is a poor product by any standard. I do not recomme3nd it and hope they one day turn the film into HD in 16:9 and add the missing footage, otherwise, I cannot think of a reason to buy this product. You will most likely be disappointed with the result unless you start with very low ecpectaions. It is significantly better than watching 4:3 versions over commercial TV delived in an analog format. If you expect more than that, plan on some level of dissatisfaction (and this is playing it back on a machine that upgrades the video quality from that on the disk - when I played it on a standard player that doesn't enhance the image it was even worse).",1356048000,8,1627,4.372937293729373

Brilliant, extensive new bonus features (I can't believe they recreated Central Perk for Kaufman and Crane's interview!) Would have liked to see the main cast being interviewed too, but it's ok, I hadn't expected these new interviews anyway.
The disc book feels sturdy and classy. The episode guide, I woulda liked it to be a hardback instead of a flimsy paperback but it's really, really great inside. A new letter from Bright-Kaufman-Crane and some well-selected cast photos.
Also epically pleased Warner have continued making region free discs as this plays fine on my region B PS3. Looks great.

So, if you want the extended versions founds on the DVDs, then you might be disappointed in this set.  If you want the original broadcast versions, then I highly recommend it.  The video quality and widescreen presentation are very nice.

I'm very pleased with this set.  The video is the best that I've seen for this series, and the audio quality is great.  I'm only on the first season so far, and while the video detail isn't at the same level as modern shows, it's definitely better than the DVDs to me.  (I actually like that the video isn't a lot more detailed than when I first saw it.  The original Star Trek series is interesting to watch in HD, but you can tell that the make up job on the actors wasn't intended to be seen in HD.)  I'm also very happy with the audio.  I watched almost the entire original run on a 27"" TV in stereo, so to watch it on a 50"" TV and have it look so good and be in surround sound is awesome for me.

I was disappointed that the DVDs didn't include the original broadcast versions (even as a viewing option), but that's because I had watched the original broadcasts with friends/family and liked the nostalgia of it.  I own the first two seasons on DVD, but I don't watch them much because of that.  However, for those of you who like the extra material, or who saw the show for the first time on DVD, I totally understand being disappointed that it isn't on the blu-rays.  It would be nice if the blu-rays had the option to watch either version.  For me, though, this release is perfect.

As a note, I own the U.K. version.  I bought it from Amazon.co.uk, and as far as I can tell, the discs and video are identical to the U.S. release.  The packaging is a bit different, though.  I mention this because you can sometimes find it quite a bit cheaper there, and I usually get it in Arizona within 10-12 days of them shipping it.

You are waiting for a line and it just isn't there or you are expecting a scene and it doesn't happen.  While HD would be great and in many ways an upgrade... the non-extended shows are in every way a downgrade (for us).  So we'll continue to hold out.

To their discredit, it does not explain why they felt it necessary to mention the subject at all. There were, apparently, several hours of extended material on the DVDs.

1174373,4,985357456X,"First glance:

Just got this today and have really enjoyed it. I also was skeptical when I heard that this series wouldn't have the extended episodes that are on the dvds.  To tell the truth I wasn't sure if I'd get this set. However I did get it and honestly not having the extended episodes isn't that bad. Yes I'll agree that Warner Brothers should have gone the extra mile and put in the extended scenes having set a prior precedent in the dvd sets. But to me I'd rather have this than nothing.

The Content:

The video is still not as good as I've seen on other Blu ray transfers but man when you go back and watch the series on dvd its amazing that we used to think dvd quality was so good. Having now seen some of my favorite episodes on these discs it'll be hard to go back and watch them on dvd with lower definition. It's really enjoyable to see them in such great quality, and really is like seeing them new.

The gag reels and extra scenes and bonus content are nice. I've never really been into checking out all the extra features but they are nice to have when you want to watch them.

One comment I will make to WB is please hire a graphic designer to make your menus. All your blu ray menus look like they were designed for kids with huge bubbly web 2.0 icons. I'm totally ok with the menu just having the words play, episodes, etc. I don't need big graphics taking up my screen, I know what ""play"" means.

Box:

The packaging is way over the top with a lenticular box and interior binder to hold all the discs. Honestly the box is nice but I would of been ok with paying 15-20 bucks less and have less spectacular case. The lenticular cover is kinda cheesy and the booklet is just a table of contents for the discs.

The one thing that bothers me about the case design is that the discs are labeled by episodes and not by season (for example discs are labeled numerical 1-21 with the episodes listed as 110-121). I would have preferred the discs to be labeled by season and then numerically (Season 4 disc 2, etc). Just a minor complaint but would have made navigating the discs to find certain seasons a whole lot easier.

Conclusion:
Is this set worth it? It depends. If you like friends as much as I do and don't care about the extended episodes missing then yes. If you are someone who's going to be bothered that there is a couple lines here and there that weren't originally aired then you probably shouldn't get this. I wouldn't hold out on this one just due to the extended scenes though. Blu ray has been out since 2006 and Friends just came out this month so the odds for WB releasing another set just aren't very good.

All in all I really like having this set and being able to see the episodes in high def. I think the price is very reasonable on this set($150 for 21 blu ray discs? I remember when they were $30 a piece!) I'll always have my Friends on dvd for when I want to see an extended episode but for me this will be my go to set to see my favorite show.

The HD transfer is simply beautiful and surprisingly so considering the vintage of the original airings.
The episode booklet is a nice touch and is better than the average ""booklet"" included with most TV show collection sets. It's a high quality softcover book and is put together well.
I certainly understand why a lot of reviewers want the extended versions of the episodes. It's human nature to want ""more"" rather than less but personally I actually prefer the original episodes that were aired, in the correct format as they were intended for TV.
The original length episodes have a better pace and are leaner and more effective in my opinion. The extra gags certainly don't contribute to the plots and if anything dwell a little too long on minor occurrences which bog down the plot with cheap one liners. Keep it moving I say :)
And on this point I have yet to concede any ""extended"" or ""directors cuts"" (Blade Runner probably being the only exception) to being better than the original featured movie/tv episode.
More often than not I walk away thinking the editor was right culling down redundant scenes and tangents that don't really add anything to the story.
But I digress, at the end of the day at approx. $150 this boxset will reward the viewer with hours of laughter and joy at an affordable price.

1174377,4,985357456X,"For anyone who thinks that these episodes are cut, please read this review from Gord Lacey at tvshowsondvd(dot)com:

""Alright, let's deal with the ""elephant in the room."" You may have read, or heard that these episodes are cut. That's completely false. These are the original airings of the episodes (with a couple exceptions, which I'll get to later) that were seen on NBC. If you sat down to watch the show on ""Must See TV"" Thursdays, this is what you would have seen, except it's in HD (and widescreen). When Warner Bros released this on DVD, years ago, they added material - stuff that was deleted from the episodes for whatever reason. When you create a TV show you log everything - all the shots, the timecode, everything. It's well-documented, and finding the material you need again is a relatively easy task. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with the extended episodes; records weren't kept, timecode didn't exist. That makes the task of finding the material to recreate the extended episodes a daunting task; one that likely would have made Friends on Blu-ray financial unfeasible. I think a good comparison would be what CBS is going through with Star Trek: The Next Generation, except that they're recreating episodes in HD that can bring them other financial revenue streams, while Friends would have to recoup everything from this one set. I think the irony here is that if Warner Bros didn't go to the trouble to create the extended episodes for the DVDs, there wouldn't be any issue with this Blu-ray set. I've gone through the entire set and noted the times of every episode, which you can find at the end of this review (I think I need a new remote now).

There were 4 ""Super-Sized"" episodes in season 7, and while those longer episodes aren't here in HD, they entire episodes are available as SD bonus material. Those are the only episodes that differ from the ""broadcast night"" versions.""

[Taken from: tvshowsondvd(dot)com]

See, it's not so bad. If they would have gone through to find all the episodes that they extended, it would have taken them much longer and the cost would have been astronomical!

Long story short, amazing to see in HD like on TBS/Nick at Nite. If you already have the series on DVD, then maybe you'd be happier with what you have and not buying this Blu-ray set. However, if you have been like me and waiting for the Widescreen HD episodes, then this does just fine. They are pretty much the same as what you'd see on your local TV station's syndicated version or on TBS/Nick at Nite.",1352937600,103,2533,4.721719457013575

1174383,1,985357456X,"If you don't want to read to the end, I'll sum it up: you're missing approximately 6 hours of friends footage. PERIOD.

While I'd like to believe Warner, I think it's pretty obvious why they released it like this.

Let's be honest, they have been airing friends in 720p for a while now, so they already had them remastered and *ready for bluray*, all they had to do was putting them in BR Discs and that was it, the versions they had were the newly-aired  ones, therefore short versions.

It is not true that the extended versions were made for the DVDS, it's the opposite, the ORIGINALS are the full episodes we saw on the DVDS.
After recording the episodes, producers/ would sit around and cut the bits and pieces that were not necessary/funny/whatever to make it fit in their 30min show timeframe, and then deliver this as the episode to be aired.

I was about to purchase this, ASSUMED it was gonna be extended... guess I was wrong. cancelling

Update: I just can't let it go, I got home, and just tested the first episode. the birth of friends.
DVD: 29:38 minutes
BluRay: 23:58

Honestly, that's a joke.

I did some quick math and having seen the dvds plenty of times I know the eps normally last between 23/25 minutes (or even more sometimes, but i checked a couple and they are between that range) while the tv aired ones (and therefore the bluray ones) only last between 21/23 minutes, lets just round the amount of extra footage per ep to 1.5 minutes, there are 238 episodes, so we're missing, or actually being stolen, 357 minutes (maybe even more), thats 6 hours worth of material, which is actually around 14 ""episodes"" of Friends.

Really, I just don't get it. Only real explanation would be that the ""raw copies"" that they used for the dvds were not really convertible to bluray (which I highly doubt, since they should be the raw original copies), or, that those copies were deleted or whatever, or maybe even some copyrights stuff problem and the only ones that were accessible were the ""nbc ones"", and that's why the remastered those.

1174385,5,985357456X,"Got the ""Friends"" boxed blu ray set today and I love it!

I know the controversy surrounding the release of this set, but it honestly does not phase me. When I first saw the episodes when they aired, these were the versions I saw. When the DVD set came out, yes, it was a wonderful bonus to have the extended episodes...but that was it, a bonus. I intend to keep my DVD box set of the complete series, so I can revisit the extended episodes as I wish...but the difference in picture and sound on these blu ray discs is amazing...just like seeing them again for the first time.

As of this writing, I have only watched 2 of the first season episodes. I have watched the bonus disc in its entirety.

What's in the box:
First off, the box is made of a VERY sturdy, thick glossy cardboard. The cover is a lenticular cover which shows the cast in the first season at one angle, and the last season at another angle. This box is held shut by magnets and opens like a chest. When opened, you will find a glossy 40 page episode guide inside with a synopsis of each episode, photos from the episodes, and some cool extra photos. Underneath this booklet, there is another very sturdy cardboard book that houses the 21 discs. There are 2 discs per page with the bonus disc being by itself on the last page of the book. The book is also held closed with magnets as the box is. A ribbon is attached to the inside of the box with these items resting on top of it, so pulling the ribbon raises the items up for easy removal.

What's on the bonus disc:
Friends From the Start: Approx 30 min, features the creation/origins of ""Friends"" with many of the creators of the show discussing how the show started, casting, creating the sets, etc.
When Friends Become Family: Approx 30 min, again featuring creators discussing how everything came together and how the show exploded into the culture
Legacy of Friends: Approx 12 min, focuses on the impact that ""Friends"" had and still has, and shows some emotional footage of the filming of the last episode and tearing down the set
Producer's Cut of ""The One Where Rachel Tells Ross"": Approx 24 min, this is the originally planned/filmed episode that was filmed prior to the 9/11 attacks, featuring a sub-plot where Chandler makes a joke about having a bomb as he and Monica are about to board the plane for their honeymoon.
Original Script for ""The One Where Rachel Tells Ross"", just as described
Music Video for The Rembrandts' ""I'll Be There for You""
Short clips of ""Friends"" on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"", approx 15 min. Features clips of David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry on ""Ellen"", each appearing individually
Short clips of ""Friends"" on ""The Tonight Show"", approx 23 min. Features the men of ""Friends"" first, sitting with Jay Leno on a recreation of the Central Perk set, discussing the ride of being on the show. The women appear next, then the men are brought out for a full reunion. This was filmed not long after the airing of the final episode, so it's not anything new.
Previously Unreleased Gag Reel, approx 8 min.

I, for one, am thrilled to have bought this. I think some people may be confusing ""broadcast"" with ""syndicated"", so just for the record, these are the original broadcast episodes. There is nothing cut from when they originally aired. The episodes on the DVD had footage ADDED to them that was never shown before. Again, I will keep my DVD box set to watch the extended episodes from time to time, but the blu rays will be my main ""go to"" for the show as they look and sound fantastic in high def.

Friends almost instantly became my favorite sitcom ever and i bought the rest of the seasons the day they came out.  I have only really seen friends episodes on my DVDs, so I only know the episodes with the uncut scenes/lines in them.  Until I saw this Blu-Ray set and saw the reviews and comments I didn't even know these lines and scenes were added for the DVDs, so for me the uncut versions are the original.  I went from excited and ready to buy, to angry and not buying in a matter of seconds.

1174415,2,985357456X,"Dear All,

I am a great fan of this show not just for its clear entertainment value, but also for the excellence of the scripts. The writing team clearly planned things out well, and to me it was a bit unusual in that it very skilfully combined humour, slapstick, intelligence, the vagaries and vicissitudes of relationships, and drama in a credible, incredible and seamless narrative which flowed with an undercurrent of intelligence, compassion, passion and caring. The whole was certainly greater than the sum of the parts in the ensemble nature of the emergence of the arc of this show, in the sense that any decision or feeling of a sufficiently large group (such as this) is usually wiser, more compassionate and more useful than that of even the most intelligent, wise and or compassionate member of that group. I found it very instructive in living life in the relative with common sense (generally speaking), albeit with an American slant (I am an Aussie).

 As with some others in this thread, I did not start watching the show until its later seasons, but warmed to it quite quickly through the reruns here in Australia that run in as much sequence as an Avogadro number of Brownian motions (sorry about that - I am also a great fan of The Big Bang Theory and studied a little Physics as part of Aero Eng). So, I have been inspired to get a full set of all the seasons preferably in as high a high def I can get.

So, when I saw it was coming out on BluRay and it would probably be cheaper with the high Aussie to buy it from the USA than to buy it here (no sales tax/GST for stuff imported under $1000), I looked forward to order this set, as it would be in a format clearly better than the reruns here, which are a bit pixellated.

However, THEN I read the reviews advising that the DVD ""director's cut"" (essentially) DVD version with the extra dialogue and takes were not going to be brought out on BluRay - only the original heavily edited original broadcasts.

The BluRay creator excuses for this, viz -

""According to TVShowsOnDVD, ""The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release."" ""
Peter Butler  |  4 reviewers made a similar statement""

and -

"" Warner Home Video's reason for this is as follows: ""The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.""""

are clearly a lot of dweeby dweebdust bulldust. Why? Because, as you will see from this link re the technical production values for the Friends show at the respected IMDb site lynk wwwDimdbDcomStitleStt0108778Stechnical (where D is a period/fullstop and S is a forward stroke), you will find the following data re what the shows were shot on and with (also seen in the credits at the end of each show) -

Technical specifications for
""Friends"" (1994)

Camera
Panaflex Camera and Lenses by Panavision

Laboratory
FotoKem Laboratory, Burbank (CA), USA

Film negative format (mm/video inches)
35 mm

Aspect ratio
1.78 : 1 (remastered version) (this is 16/9 - ie 16:9 widescreen = 1.77 recurring)
1.33 : 1  (this is the original 4:3 TV non-widescreen format at the time of broadcasts, at least early in the series)

I bet with a show of this calibre, they would have the original master and sub-master prints of the 35 mm film of each episode kept under Fort Knox type security and would be of pristine quality. Note that as an aside, they used major feature film quality gear in the form of Panavision cameras and lenses and 35mm film (note that HD digital technology was just starting to become acceptable for high end stuff just as the final season of Friends came to an end in May 2004, so I guess they only had film as the only option to create and preserve quality, especially in view of advertisers paying $2million for a 30 second ad in the final show).

The main point I am making is that they have ALL the original footage in high def 35mm film shot on Panavision cameras. Clearly it is high def enough to bring out the truncated BluRay version they will be releasing in November. Because they have ALL this original footage, including outtakes and bloopers and all the original footage put into the DVD version, and ALL of this original footage is the maximum def you can get that was suitable for the BluRay version they are releasing anyway,  there is absolutely no reason why they cannot release at least the same amount of footage as they released in the DVD version of the series, if not more.

The decision they have made, IMHO, and to be generous about it, is brain-damaged. They are missing out on making a fortune by not releasing, as I would suggest, 2 versions (neither being the extent set they plan to flog) of the BluRay set, viz -

1.  Gold BluRay Edition - Same content as the previous extant DVD set, but in BluRay format.
2.  Platinum BluRay Edition - Same as Gold, but with ALL the extra outtakes, bloopers, interviews and every mm of the original footage as special features that were ever shot, so the buyers of this edition get to see and hear everything that was ever done on set and recorded on camera. In this way, no fan could ever complain of having anything that was filmed on the Friends' set being withheld from their viewing pleasure, and they would never have to bring out another set, unless of course a new technology comes up better than BluRay. This is still on the cards, as below.

BluRay has a max resolution of 19201080p which matches present HDTV monitor standards, but even now, there are Ultra-high-definition televisions (UHDTV) with the following resolutions -

2160p (3840  2160 progressive scan)
4320p (7680  4320 progressive scan)

Say if the above 7680  4320 resolution was on a 40"" wide screen. The resolution, assuming square pixels, would then be 7680/40 = 192 pixels per inch (BluRay, using the same screen would be 1920/40 = 48 pixels per inch, 4 times less). The human eye, with normal vision, can resolve up to about 2400 pixels per inch (Google on it) because the mechanical resolution of a normal retina is increased by stereoscopic vision and brain processing, including cognitive interpolation and possibly also extrapolation. So, human resolution is still about 2400/192 = 12.5, or to be conservative, about 10 times better than even the present Ultra-high-definition televisions which are in turn 4 times better than BluRay. So the human eye can resolve up to 40 times better than even BluRay.

So, if the original Panavision-sourced 35mm Friends film stock masters and submasters have a resolution better than BluRay, Warner could bring out post BluRay versions later. Maybe that's why they are holding back, but even this argument makes no sense, as it would be ages before post BluRay players and screens with even higher resolutions become commonplace, and we as the viewing public will probably have to endure another format war like the recent BluRay/HDDVD scuffle.

In conclusion, Warner has no cogent and honest reason why they cannot release a BluRay version at least as content-full and rich as the present extant DVD widescreen release. Any excuse they give is simply some kind of smokescreen to hide some other agenda not conducive to viewers expectations. We have great expectations of them. We greatly expect their provisioning should not grate on our sensibilities as it now seems to do with this proposed BluRay release. Maybe they simply wanted to get it out in time for Thanksgiving/Christmas sales and did not have the time or energy to do it properly. Still not acceptable IMHO. Their enormous resources would be able to rise to the challenge, so even this commercial reason also does not make sense.

Awe the best, cheers and enjoy.

1174425,2,985357456X,"I'm a huge fan of ""Friends,"" in fact it's probably my favorite TV show of all time. Interestingly, I didn't start watching the show until it was in its 9th season. I dismissed it as a ""chick show,"" but when I finally started catching re-runs when I was in college, it had me rolling! It was right at this point that they began releasing the full seasons on DVD. So every time a new season was released on DVD I went right out and bought it. The first time that I saw many of these episodes (probably 80% of the series) was on DVD. For those of you that don't know this, the DVDs actually contained longer episodes than what had been originally broadcast on NBC. Each 20-minute episode contained another 2 or 3 minutes of dialogue/story. And it wasn't excessive stuff that needed to be cut, many of my favorite lines in the show were in these extended scenes. In fact, when I go back and watch re-runs of the show now I can't believe how much of it is missing. I still love my DVDs though, special features and all! But when I watch them now on my 47"" TV I notice that they look pretty rough. There's lots of pixelation and fuzziness, and the episodes aren't formatted for widescreen. Certain channels have been showing the episodes in HD and they look gorgeous! I thought to myself, ""I would actually buy the whole series over again on Blu-Ray if it had all the extended episodes and bonus features from the standard DVD set.""

When I learned that ""Friends"" was coming to Blu-Ray I was so excited, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Then I learned that this Blu-Ray boxed set would not contain the previously released extended episodes, but would instead have them as they appeared in the original NBC broadcast. Warner Home Video's reason for this is as follows: ""The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.""  ...What does THAT mean? You can transfer the short episodes but not the long ones? That makes no sense! Whatever was done to clean up the episodes that they've been showing on TV in HD, they can do for the extended episodes. I think someone just got lazy and decided this would be good enough. While I desperately want my favorite show in HD, I will not fork out over $200 for an inferior product! I know these (extended) episodes like the back of my hand, and I won't be able to truly enjoy the show with the absence of so many great scenes and lines. I'd rather watch bad resolution ""Friends"" in its entirety than watch a cleaned up abridged version. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it's still an awesome show, and for casual fans this might be enough. However, for fans like me this will simply not do. This reminds me of George Lucas only releasing the versions of Star Wars that nobody likes, or Peter Jackson putting out The Lord Of The Rings trilogy on Blu-Ray but waiting over a year to put out the extended versions.

1174429,4,985357456X,"I realize many are disappointed that the episodes do not contain the extended versions of episodes, but neither are these episodes cut SYNDICATED versions, just to clear up possible misunderstandings. These are the versions that aired Thursday nights on NBC for a decade. (Example? Nick at Nite, for whatever prudish reason, ALWAYS cuts the awesome ""You BITCH!"" line from Chandler to Monica during the scene in TOW Phoebe's Husband in S2 where it is discovered by the gang - thanks to Monica - that Chandler has a third nipple. It *is* left intact here.)

So, these versions *are* longer than the syndicated versions as shown on TBS and Nick at Nite, but shorter than the extended episodes found on the DVD releases, *minus* the Super-Sized episodes, which keep the longer length.

I received the set, and the quality is absolutely stunning. Add in the hours of new bonus materials (*in addition* to the bonus materials found on the DVD sets), and it is well worth the money. Also of note, as I mentioned above, NBC used to do Super Sized episodes in the later seasons, and these *are* present in the set, meaning unedited. So there *are* some longer episodes included here, along with the original script for the episode TOW Rachel Tells Ross.

Does it suck that the extended cuts are not used? Sure, I admit it. But I am taking Warner Brothers at its word in that the bonus scenes were not available and/or suitable for inclusion. And considering it is these versions seen in the original run, I can live with it, although I know for others, that is not the case.

Still, for the bonus materials and picture quality alone, I think this set is definitely worth the expense.",1346112000,4,1674,4.703071672354949

#1. I already have every episode on DVD (The extended cuts).
In my personal opinion, any self respecting Friends fan would ALREADY have every episode on DVD.

#2. Even though some of the extended scenes are hilarious, I would also like to see the episodes in original broadcast cuts.
I was too young to really pay attention to any show that was not a cartoon, however this was my mother's favorite show.  So, about 6 months after the show ended, I bought my mom ""Friends: The Complete Tenth Season"" on DVD as I'd always known her to watch the show.  I watched them with her and I started to love the show and eventually collected the rest of the season on my own.  This means the only versions of episodes I know are the extended versions.  I'd personally like to see them as they originally were, because for me, any factor about a TV series (whether it be cut scenes, original edits, unaired episodes, any history whatsoever) is really cool, so being able to see one of the best shows of all time in the many formats the episodes come in will be awesome!!

#3. The Blu-Ray is all that matters.
The only thing that really matters about the set is the fact that we finally get to see our six closest friends in high-definition.

As Amazon keeps deleting my link, feel free to comment on my review and I can e-mail it to you.

I am a huge FRIENDS fan and I am very disapointed in this, however I do still plan on purchasing this Blu-ray set once it greatly goes down in price.

*** Update ***

I ended up purchasing and importing the UK edition of FRIENDS on Blu-ray because I liked the UK packaging much better, plus it was about half the price of the US version at the time.

When I first popped the disc in and started watching I was presented with a nice HD picture and sound and I appreciate all the care they took in bringing Friends to Blu for us. Sadly I am very upset, and more bothered than I thought I would be, in all I know I am missing by simply watching these broadcast versions. There is a lot cut out and even the basic cutting of scenes is quicker and made to fit a commercial in. I love the show and I have enjoyed watching them all over again, however I miss the little jokes they cut out. Over-all I am glad I own it, however I really hope one day the will release the extended cuts on Blu-ray!",1341273600,383,3685,4.441481481481482
1174458,5,985357456X,"I see a lot of people are on here leaving product reviews when they bought it from a different website. Personally I think you should just leave a review on the website you bought it from mostly because I almost didn't buy it because I saw all the poor ratings without reading the actual reviews but on the plus after reading those reviews I will never buy DVD's from Ebay.

I bought my Friends: The Complete Series Collection from Amazon and it's fantastic. All the disks play perfectly. I loved the book it came with, it's not much it just gives the episode name and a short description of each episode but the pictures are what I liked the most.

 I would complain about is the shape of the box set. At first when I got it I loved it but then I watched all the episodes and I had to find a place to put it. It's long and skinny so I had to find a special place to store it because it didn't fit with the rest of my DVDs. This is a very minor problem and I would buy it again without thinking twice.  The other thing I didn't care for is that the disks aren't labeled with the season, you would either have to check the book or play the DVD to find out what season it's from. Season 5 is by far my favorite, I love when Chandler and Monica were hiding their relationship so I watch that season more often then the others.

Overall this is a excellent buy. I would say to hold out for the price to decrease I bought mine for $93.10 but when I came to write this review I see the price is at $115.00 just two weeks later. I would still buy it for that price there will never be a show like this again. The cast is amazing and every episode is memorable.",1341100800,,1653,4.058282208588957

1174482,4,985357456X,"When all said and done, I am not dissatisfied.  I wanted a cheap alternative to buying each season's box set individually (for a lot more money I might add), and this was it.  I was afraid of the early reviews that said the DVDs wouldn't play or were missing, but I've not had that problem.  Could use better thought out packaging, yes, could use more extra footage if you're going to BUY it rather than watch reruns on tv for free, yes.  But all in all it accomplished what I wanted... I get to see the entire run, with the fragments that were cut out for time during original airing still in place, without commercials, and in sequence.  I was about the same age as the characters when they were on the air, so watching it is like going home again in some ways.  I read the bad reviews and took the risk of buying it anyway... SO totally worth it.

**EDIT** I've just finished the whole set.  The gag reel DVD only has seasons 1-4 and 10 on it... have to resort to looking the rest up online I guess.  Everything played on my pc but there were a few random issues while watching them on a bluray player.  Still worth the money, but could've been a little more inclusive.",1330646400,3,1172,4.262443438914027
1174483,5,985357456X,"I received my order ahead of the date stated which was a great surprise as this was a gift item. The details of the product did not do the actual item justice. The series arrived in an excellent collectors box and the 10 seasons are carfully split between the six characters of the show; with each containing a little over two seasons. Each of the character cases has their current picture on the front and their picture during the tv series on the back. In addition, the character cases are hard bound and sturdy with sleeves for each of the cd's appointed to that character. Also included in the series box is a very nice soft cover book of pictures and stories from the show and the characters. This turned out to be an excellent keepsake for a beloved tv series and was full of extras that were unexpected. It is a very nice package and I would highly recommend it to any fan of the Friends Series. You won't be disappointed.",1330300800,,929,4.406976744186046

1174485,5,985357456X,"Item showed up right when it was supposed to. This was a christmas present for my nieces. I already have these, which were bought individually by season. This set is broken up into six ""books"", which have six disks in each, and each disk has five or six episodes in order (ep 1-6, 80-85, ect.). The accompanying book gives the episode names, numbers, and a short description of each episode. There's also a few games dispersed through the disks, as well as director's commentary, and a few ""behind the scenes"" stuff as well.

All in all, if your a fan of F*R*I*E*N*D*S then this collection is way cheaper then buying each season separately.",1328572800,,640,4.663716814159292

I had ordered a series collection before from amazon of a different show and it was packaged smilar and had no problems, so I decided to buy Friends anyway. Most of the discs did work, however there was 2 - 3 episodes that had a bit of skipping. But considering there are 236 episodes plus and maybe two of the episodes didn't work at all and another episode skipped and I only caught half, I mean, probaly still a good deal. Also note that this goes WAY on sale on cyber monday so if want an even better deal, wait til then. We purchased on black friday and then cyber monday came and it was $20 cheaper still! So heads up on that.",1328572800,,742,4.159722222222222

1174488,1,985357456X,"Ok, let me start off by saying I think Friends is one of the greatest shows ever made.  I was to young to watch it when it was on TV.  But after seeing reruns, I had to have the series set.  My mom got it for me this Christmas and I was super excited.  I decided to open it a few days ago, to see if any of the DVDs were scratched.  Well, I did not even get to open it, I noticed that the left past of the lid was ripped all the way up.  As a collector, I couldn't let this be.  So, Amazon told my mom to send it back and they would send her another one.  I got my other set yesterday.  I opened it today and I was so upset.  Most of the DVDs have marks all over then.  Be it a little mark, or a cluster of marks.  My mom told me to watch them all and see if they worked.  I informed her that there are over 200 episodes.  So, Amazon gave her a partial refund.  I don't think it was really enough.  I mean, I have no clue how many of these DVDs will even play.  I was reading online and it seems the UK version is better.  So NOW I have to either get a or set my DVD player to multi region and get the 15th anniversary edition from the UK amazon.  It is a shame.  Such a great show left stained by the fault of bad packaging.  If you want to get this, I would say be ready to have some DVDs that have marks.  I am not saying they will not play, but to me, not knowing is almost as bad as them not working.

Oh, and I am almost sure the pictures of them on the front is a big sticker that you could pull off if you tried hard enough.  If they put this series out on blu ray, let us hope they do a better job!!!!",1327363200,,1610,3.653958944281525
1174489,5,985357456X,"I was at first a little skeptical at ordering the complete series as I saw so many negative reviews. When it arrived I immediately opened it and began my marathon! RIght now I'm in season 5 and I've only had a few minor skips/pauses. The packaging is great, and its a soft glossy area where the DVD's are held, not plain cardboard. Glad I got it!",1327190400,,346,4.257575757575758

1174494,4,985357456X,"I love watching ""Friends"" while I'm doing laundry or household chores. It's something I have watched enough times that it is still entertaining and familiar enough that I don't have to be glued to the t.v. so I don't miss anything. If you are a ""Friends"" fan, I highly recommend this set. Each season box has the show title for each episode, and I love the whole title ""The One Where...."" Definitely a good buy, though personally I bought the set for sixty dollars on sale at a used video shop. I would say that you probably have to be a pretty big fan to buy the whole series though, otherwise you pay a lot of money for a set you may only watch once or twice. That's just my opinion though!",1326585600,,692,4.25

1174496,5,985357456X,"I gave this to my wife for Xmas and she couldn't be happier.  The 6 book organization is a little goofy, it would have made more sense to split it into 10 seasons.  Do not have any scratched discs that people have complained about, at least not yet.  If we discover something that won't play then will update review.  Besides that, its Friends!!  You can't really mess that up.  This was MUCH less expensive than buying each season separately.",1326499200,,443,4.544303797468355

However, upon receipt, the box is of fine quality and all disks are nicely packaged in individual sleeves within a folder for each season (Note: as a precaution in light of the complaints, I immediately removed each disk and inserted a thin vinyl sleeve into the holder to prevent scratches in the future).  Although we have yet to play every disk, a sampling of disks from each season plays perfectly on all players (DVD and Blueray).  We had purchased a few individual seasons before, but this is an excellent way to have the entire set in one spot and at one price.  The informative book that comes with the set is a nice added bonus.
Not that I doubt any reported problems, but we ordered directly through Amazon and the product is perfect.",1324944000,,846,4.695945945945946

None of the discs are missing- all ten seasons are there, they're just in six sleeves (one for each character). The quality of the DVDs is exactly like it is on television- it is a 1990's TV show, and these discs are NOT in high definition. If that is what you are aiming for, look elsewhere or wait until Amazon offers them in HD (if they ever do). You can tell these DVDS are not bootlegged- they come in an awesome copyrighted box with factory sealed packaging. I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he loved it.

Now that the series ended a few years ago, I can look back and see how it iverall was one of the best series in television history.  First, I must commend the excellent writing that each show had.  Funny, sometimes sad, but always entertaining and interesting.  The actors, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Anistron, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox make up this great crew.  I can't give details  becuase it would take to long for this review.  However, from an overall perspective, you can see how the cast matured over the years, how everything fell into place in the lives of the characters, and the great twists of the plot truely made this a must see every Thursday Night.  I miss this series, hopefully one day they can do a reunion and an update of the characters lives.

1174519,5,985357456X,"When I first read the reviews about this particular item, I was a little skeptical. However, I'm REALLY happy I bought this. I've grown tired of watching episodes on the CW waiting for my favorite ones to come on and NEVER getting a full episode on YOUTUBE and not having them streamed through NetFilx. Not only are NONE of the discs scratched but the BEST thing about them is that while they contain ALL the episodes in their entirety (meaning that what I've seen in reruns are cut-up episodes that don't hold a candle to these) the final episode is an extended version. Also, I have a big HD tv, and even though the episodes are presented in full-screen, they aren't blocked off by bars at the side, meaning that the episodes fill your ENTIRE TV. You also get a booklet containing the story behind the creation of ""Friends"", a brief description of each episode and if they have commentary with the creators and executive producers. Also, for each episode, if there's a famous guest star, it tells you who they are. Many of the discs also have special features including, but not limited to, previews of each episode. The discs are contained in six different booklets (one for each friend) and are covered by two pictures (one on each side) which show the characters at the first and tenth seasons. The discs themselves have pictures of their characters on them in various seasons. The number of episodes they contain are on the front of the booklets as well (1-43, 44-79, etc). The episodes are done in sequence, which you would expect, but the season premieres are all at the start of the disc they are on, which is just as well. I actually ended up paying less for this item than if I had bought the individual seasons. Even if they were used (which this set that I got wasn't) I probably saved close to $100. In fact, this products only flaw is that the episodes aren't divided by scene, but that is easily overlooked when you consider all the special features offered, the fact that these episodes ARE NOT cannibalised and their AMAZING price. I HIGHLY recommend this item to any die-hard ""Friends"" fan who doesn't own half or all of the seasons. If you own two or three seasons, get this set because you will SAVE money. If you own four or more seasons, well, you'll STILL get a great product.",1319846400,15,2300,4.557971014492754

1174534,5,985357456X,"I strongly dislike it when people don't review the product itself, rather their experience with the buyer.  Keep in mind items are represented on Amazon by many a seller ... so if the seller was poor, rate the seller, not the item!

I personally am not the biggest fan of the series (bought this for my girlfriend), the show is okay IMO, but that shouldn't play a role in this rating, should it? So I won't let it affect it.

Here we go.  5 (FIVE) STARS.  Based on the items description, there is no reason for me to rate it anything other than 5 stars.

Packaging (box and DVDs) is what they say and appear to be doing their job.  Box holding everything is sturdy.  The 40 DVDs are held in place well enough.  I know many feel that the DVDs are needlessly getting scratched, but I don't see how that becomes an issue provided you are careful taking them out and putting them back in.

All of the small extras, such as each of the 6 Friends being featured on a DVD holder and on the individual disks (all different photos on the DVDs themselves) is a nice feature.  Along with that, the obvious bonuses of the episode guides, documentaries, etc.. make for a nice round out to the set.

If you don't have many of the individual seasons as of now, this set is worth a good, hard, strong look considering its fair pricing, quality packaging, and all the extras it has to tie the entire series up into one nice boxed set.",1310428800,2,1417,4.305660377358491

We have gotten an incredible value out of this purchase.  1/2 point off however as the very last disk (series finale) was missing, and 1/2 point off for BluRay not even being available.

A side note:  We've been watching Big Bang Theory a lot lately, it's shot on the same soundstage as Friends was, at the Warner Brothers lot.  There are some elements that are the same, e.g. the front door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, the pillar to the right of the Friends kitchen (Monica bang!) and the little hallway leading to Monica's mystery closet.  It took me a few episodes to make the connection, but my Mom figured it out only 10 minutes into her first Big Bang episode.

They would either spin really loudly, spin loudly then stop, or just not spin at all. At first i thought it was my DVD drive that was the problem. I went back and looked through all the dvds, and every single one has minor scratches on it (didnt affect the playing), and the ones that wouldnt spin at all had very small chips along the edges of the discs, therefore not letting them spin properly or not spin at all. Its happened with quite a few of these discs and i am very disappointed. I don't know how to send it back or refund it without my receipt or anything, since its been awhile.

1174540,5,985357456X,"given the nature o' my other reviews this one may seem wildly out o' place; but the fact is, i LOVE to laugh.  now i never saw this series when it was on; in fact, i began a few years ago with season 4 at a garrison library.  simply put - i laughed my ass off.  long story short, with only seeing less than 1/2 o' the entire series i decided to risk the box set.  it's clear all the pieces were in place in season 1 - albeit in rough-sketch form; but by the end o' S3 there is no denying they had perfected the formula that would consistently carry the show from 'the one with the jellyfish' to 'the last one'

would i know any o' these people in real life?  probably not (although i may have bumped into Phoebe at a Carcass show...), but what makes this series more than repeatable viewing is the high quality o' writing.  period.  ok, that and all the actor's commitment to ensuring that the writing was actually improved upon - no mean feat.  as komedies go there is not a bad episode to be found in the last 7 seasons - actually no real bad shows during the 1st few either; but it's clear that shortly into S3 some o' the characters stopped being parodies o' themselves and relaxed into actual human beings...at which point it became truly must-see.  not even the mighty 'seinfeld' can consistently match the riotous heights achieved here

there's no telling how much longer this juggernaut could've kept going, but one thing is obvious, the show went out at the TOP o' its game - another rarity in this age o' milking dead horses.  do you enjoy laughing?  then invest in this series...for the money it is without a doubt the best health plan EVER offered by an amerikan corporation

...joey's guest spot on 'the pyramid' (season 10) is one o' the funniest comedy sketches written in the english language; in fact, 'the one where the stripper cries' is a high point in the history o' comedy, period",1304899200,,1902,4.381766381766382

Problems include scratches and deformities, poor copy quality and DVD cancer (early read failures).  Most knock-off versions do not include the published materials (series booklet and such) included with the genuine Warner Home Video product.  That's because duplicating DVD's is cheap to the Chinese, but printing a glossy multicolor booklet is too expensive.

I've seen one package with UPC 012569832688 which appeared proper and complete, with DVD's which worked.  I assume that is the real Warner Home Video UPC code.

Amazon should require that the UPC be disclosed on every listing and it should work to eradicate the knock-off problem by requiring a warning to people looking at such products.

If your friends complete series did not come with the booklet, it is very likely that you got a fake one.

My husband got this set for me as a gift from a seller on amazon website and we were surprised to see it was brand new for only $100.
When we got the product, we realized it was fake. The colors were faded, the dvds were packed in little plastic bags and it was missing all the extras that the set comes with.

BE AWARE WHEN BUYING THESE. SOME SELLERS MIGHT BE SELLING FAKE ONES.

1174590,4,985357456X,"At first, I purchased the box set for $139 through an Amazon partner. Characteristics:

* Six smaller albums within, each containing several DVDs, individually wrapped in plastic. The DVDs were held into place using cardboard tabs.
* Two CDs of music (normally sold separately.)
* A printed piece of paper was affixed to the back of the red box. This paper did not easily detach, and so I did not do so for fear of marring the box further.
* The six smaller albums had questionable print quality on the outside. The tabs were frustrating to place DVDs into.
* When removed, the plastic wrapping on each DVD marred the surface of the discs in spots and caused problems when playing on multiple devices.

I would have kept it despite the other flaws, but the playback issues were unacceptable. The partner was good about giving me my money back, including return postage.

Amazon then had a sale on the product for $99, not involving a partner. I decided to take a chance and try again. This item had the following characteristics:

* Same six albums contained within, but much better print quality. Also, each DVD was held in a pocket, and no plastic covering on each DVD.
* The printed piece of paper came off of the red box very easily, and it looks great.
* The two audio CDs were omitted. No great loss to me, but some might miss them.
* This version included a nice book with photos and various piecs of information.
* No playback issues!

The bottom line is to make sure, if you're getting it from an Amazon partner (or someone outside of the Amazon ecosystem), to ensure that you receive the revised edition.",1277078400,45,1614,4.551724137931035

It was obvious that the plastic on the product was not the original. The box (case) was torn on the side, the picture on the front was worn so bad I couldn't even tell what it was, and there was a layer of dust UNDERNEATH the plastic! I immediately opened it and the cases and labels looked like they were made on a personal printer. Since this is the only set I have seen, I don't know if they all look that cheap, but I wouldn't be suprised to find out that this whole set was an illegal copy. The discs, however, minus the labels, appeared to be new. The reason I was so embarassed was because I bought this as a gift for someone. I actually had to EXPLAIN that this was ""New"". I tested several of the discs to see if there was even anything on them. They played but any rapid movements on the show looked strange: wavy/jumpy is really the only way I can explain it. It's possible that these sets were manufactured as cheap as possible to maximize profit and that is the reason it looks and plays poorly, but due to the condition in which I received my ""new"" product, I am suprised the episodes weren't in Chinese with English subtitles. I actually considered giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because if this was for myself instead of a gift, I really wouldn't be that concerned with the condition of the casing.  As I stated, the discs were in good condition and I did get it for a good price (about what you would expect to pay for a used set).

However, the manufacturer's packaging leaves a lot to be desired... definitely the economy version.

The series of Friends in one sense is a fantastic excursion with 6 friends and their inter-related experiences.  It is a witty, well written humorous sitcom; however, there is another side that sneaks right in alongside all the fun.  It heavily promotes pornography through constant references to it, and the ""acceptable"" use of it among the friends; it boldly promotes homosexuality; and it definitely throws sex into the level of a handshake: ""Hi, nice to meet you, want to have sex?""  It is implied through action more than spoken, thouh there are plenty of verbals!

Definitely keep it away from the young and impressionable members of the household!

True I didn't join the ladies as often as I now wish I had, but what I did see still made me laugh. So I purchased a copy for myself with my new Best Buy card when I was at the store this last weekend searching for a cordless phone. The set of course contains all ten seasons in a largeish box. The box contains a series of small cardboard books, for lack of a better term, each page of which contains two disks, one on the front and one on the back. Of course the potential for damage to the disks is there but if you remove and insert them with reasonable care this can be minimized and/or avoided. I haven't had any problems at any rate, and as I'm totally blind and therefore had to make several attempts to find the first season this is a good thing. It took me a few minutes.
  The show itself is funny and, in my opinion at least, much cleaner than what's considered commedy these days. Oh it has its share of sexual humor but it's clear that the creators made an effort to keep that within reasonable limits. And I suddenly find I can't get enough of the theme song, a tune which often used to annoy the hell out of me when the show would come on TV. It's funny how that sometimes happens.

They were all there (per labeling), but at least half had some sort of a rub or scratch on the play side.  Most of the flaws were minor rubs, scuffs, or scratches, but two had short but deep appearing scratches.  We watched the DVD with the largest scratch first and it played fine so the others should be ok.

The four stars is because of the discs being damaged: putting DVDs in a tight-fitting cardboard sleeve is a terrible idea; why not just package them between pieces of bark? I don't expect, or want, 20 of the book style opening plastic cases like you get single/double DVDs in, but they could've put the discs in soft lined CD/DVD envelopes.

I didn't have to send the defective one back for a few weeks so I went through every disc to make sure there were no problems with this new set. There wasn't so I sent the defective one back.

Long story short, I received a Chinese bootleg. Of course the seller was long gone by the time I noticed, Amazon couldn't help me because it was beyond the ""grace"" period... I reordered the set from Amazon and every disc played fine. The ""official"" set is in a larger box, the graphics on box and the discs were much more vibrant...also the bootleg did not contain the Friends book, so if you received something like I did, return it immediately!!

I went ahead and ordered thinking I would inspect it right away and return it if it was flawed in any way ($134.99 is a GREAT price although I guess I just missed an all-time low price of $114.99). Not only did I receive the product promptly (less than 48 hours after the order went through). It arrived in perfect condition. I immediately tested all 40 discs (playing the start of random episodes on each disc) and I found NO PROBLEMS (by the way, the episodes ARE in chronological order and each disc DOES have a main menu which makes it very easy to go to any specific episode).

The DVDs are wrapped in a loose plastic container which was weird. But the DVDs work fine.

I don't know if it's the packaging or the discs themselves, but about one in every four discs has issues - either there is a lot of skipping or certain episodes won't play at all. I've tried playing these discs on several different machines, and even though there are no discernible scratches on some of the problem discs, they still won't play.

Unfortunately, when you buy a 10 season set, you don't always find problems with it until the return period is over - so I have to keep these and hope that I can still enjoy some of it.

***Edit***

I ended up complaining to Amazon, and they let me return this box set, even though it was way past the usual return policy deadline. Props to Amazon. I ended up purchasing the individual season sets, and even though some of the dvds don't work perfectly (i.e. they sometimes don't let you play individual episodes by choosing the episode, but they will play the episode if you choose ""play disc"" and just fast forward to the appropriate place), I am now satisfied.

Friends lasted for 10 seasons and captured the hearts ad laughter of people all over the world. The show was about 6 friends who dealt with life issues such as love, sex and crazy little things in between. This set includes all the great episodes from start to finish.

The day it arived at my house I was excited to open it up and begin to relieve the show that made me laugh and cry. Amazong packaged the set amazingly. It was tightly wrapped in 2 boxes so that it wold not get damaged while being shipped. After I tore open the boxes I grabbed my set out and examined it. No dents or marks. Amazon did a great job with the packaging. The set itself is beautiful. You open it up and inside are 6 different cd cases inside. Each case has a friend on each. One side is when they were older as the show progressed and the other side was a picture of what they looked like when the show first began. The disc in each case did the same thing. Then i noticed that there was a big booklet inside. The booklet is long and includes a note from the creators about how the show came to be and also rundowns of each episode. The booklet is beautiful cause there are also promo pictures of them inside which are very nice pictures.

Overall I have to say that I am very satisfied with this set. There are 40 discs inside. There are also special features as well. I am happy that I get to remain friends with Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe. This show is a hit and a must have.",1234396800,,1612,4.098101265822785

1174682,4,985357456X,This item came quickly and made my daughters' screech with excitement on Christmas Day.  I would've given 5 stars except for the fact that one of the DVDs was duplicated.  I am missing 1  disc and cannot get information about how to replace it.  Sending the entire package back doesn't seem necessary.  So....I'm stuck with 2 of the same discs  and missing one.,1231718400,,361,4.650793650793651

1174691,5,985357456X,"I totally love this Box set! I am a huge fan of Friends, and have always wanted the whole series, but never wanted to buy the seasons. When I saw this I had to have it. I got this as a gift, and fell in love with it as soon as I opened it. I believe the way it is put together is wonderful. The way they have 6 little sets with each Friend's face, and a set of DVD's in each one, that each disc has that same Friend's face on it, is just lovely. I love the giant book that comes with it.
I have read reviews where they talk about the cardboard that is holding the disc and how it scratches them when removing a disc. This is so not true, for me at least! If you jerk the disc out, then yes they will be scratched. However, if you slighty pull up on the disc and slowly remove them, then they are fine. I have removed all disc, and not scratched a one yet.
I think this is a must have for anyone wanting the whole series!",1230768000,,920,3.8219895287958114

Since I am a big fan of the show I enjoy watching the dvds in order and remembering exactly how and when everything happened.  This is an absolute must have for any fan of the show!

The box set includes 40 DVDs which are divided into 6 groups.  Each group is kept in a pouch that contains 6-8 dvds.

I got the series this past Christmas, and have finally finished the entire series.  I didn't have any problems with scratches or duplicated disks.  The only issue I had was one of the corners of the red box is messed up, but everything else worked fine.

If you don't have any of the Friends seasons and want them, then this is what you need to save up your money to buy.  Buying all the seasons individually will be more expensive.  Having 10 seasons compressed into 6 booklets for the 6 friends does pose a problem when looking for a certain episode but a book is included.

This will definitely be one of those shows that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.  LOVE IT! :)",1220659200,2,861,4.1017964071856285

I suspected that these are not original, so returned the package.

The seller however was co-operative and made an immediate refund. Hence the 2nd star.

1174723,1,985357456X,"I received this set as a gift... and i was disappointed at the way this collection was made. The discs are in poorly glued together paper booklets with no protection for the reading surface whatsoever. Unless you CAREFULLY and TEDIOUSLY remove them when u want to watch it... there's a guarantee that you'll end up with multiple scratches. (putting it back in is just as harmful) ... i've watched up to season 6 so far... and i've experienced 3 damaged disc (the reading surface was clearly damaged during packaging and i'm not talking about minor scratch). I cannot watch those episodes because of the damaged portion.

It's not worth it to invest money in this set if you end up not being able to watch multiple episodes. In addition, sliding it in and out with the surface in contact with the paper sleeves will seriously cause damage.

:( I'm highly disappointed that whoever designed this set was so inconsiderate of the fans. . .

i know people say ""oh but it's cheap"" ... sure it is... if you're okay with paying around $200 and not being able to collect the whole series because the product was so poorly made. :/",1215648000,50,1121,4.595

For me, it just got better and better as the seasons went on, leading up to a perfect series finale. Ross and Rachel! Monica and Chandler! Phoebe and Mike! Joey!

I have not been able to look through this 100% but 90% that I have looked at has been no different from purchasing the individual seasons.

1174766,2,985357456X,"I love this show but I am returning this box set and decided to order the individual seasons separately for the following reasons:

1) Many of the DVDs are faulty and skip even when they are not physically scratched. I tested this with multiple DVD players which have never given me problems before. If you check other reviews this quality control issue is pretty common with the DVDs from this box set. From what I can tell the quality control on the original season sets is much better.

2) Disc 28 was missing and I got two copies of Disc 29 instead.

3) The corner of the collector's box was broken/damaged when i received it.

4) The discs are spread out through 6 scratch-prone cardboard-like  sleeves for each character instead of by Season. Cute, but i don't want to have to open up a damn episode guide and look up the episode number to figure out which season i'm about to watch, while worrying about scratching my DVDs when taking them in and out of the sleeves.",1197417600,356,973,4.47457627118644

I just received this set from Amazon today, and the first disc I started watching was scratched and it skipped quite a bit.  I'm shipping this back immediately.  This packaging is very poorly designed.

On a side note, the size of the box is also less than ideal.  It's doesn't fit well with other DVDs on a shelf.

I'm going to buy the individual seasons separately instead!  The individual seasons are properly packaged with slim plastic disc holders.  Plus, they are the size of other DVDs.",1197072000,190,612,4.5504587155963305
1174768,5,985357456X,"I recieved my Friends Complete Collection today! I'm so excited, I've already watched a few of my favorites.

One of my concerns was something I caught on one of the discussion boards (on this page).. about ending up with a missing disc, and having a replica of another instead. Luckily, that didn't happen :)

All the episodes are in order, from the very first to the very last. Subtitles are an option.

The box I have here is slightly dented on one of the top corners, there is an extremely minor tear I saw on the box as well, and one of the corners of the booklet is a little bent. But overall, I'm very happy with the product to be honest. As long as the discs are okay. Nobody would notice the (very) slight wear.

The discs I've viewed so far work perfectly.  The collection does include some bonus features. The booklet is helpful. In case anyone is wondering?.. It's a horizontal folder-sized booklet with a picture of the inside of the empty coffee house on it. The back has the apartment with everyone in it. The booklet has a description of each main character inside it and several pictures throughout. The booklet is divided in sections by season.

The overall red box's top (the part that opens) isn't locked in some way to shut close. It opens and closes freely. I had an idea about hot gluing a piece of ribbon and a button for the ribbon to close on. (Since it doesn't overlap to velcro it). Depends if I have that kind of extra time. Either way, it's fine the way it is.

There are six booklet-kind-of-holder/cases for the CDs. Some of you have heard that the CDs might get scratched by it's 'casing'. Each disc has it's individual place.. the material is like thick cardpaper.. and there's a somewhat gloss where the CD touches the paper in the insert. ..Hope that helps understand what it's like, better.

Anyways, I'm so glad it's finally here! Apparently if you're interested in the limited edition's ""frosted"" door box, it's availabe for about $20 on their site. I read about it on the limited edition's discussion board, just in case anyone is interested =)",1196985600,13,2083,4.550802139037433

They play the intro, but instead of going to the Friends theme song it just stops. This was very frustrating for me since many of the episodes that wouldn't play were ones I really wanted to watch, like Monica and Chandler's wedding.  This isn't Amazon's fault, it is the manufacturers fault.  The lady I talked to on the phone about this problem said that the whole batch of Friends DVD's they had currently, were all probably defective and said I should wait at least 15 days to order a new one.

This is the best set for the entire seasons. I originally bought each individual season, then had to buy the 50 lb limited box cabinet set but then had to get rid of that to make way for this compact set.

Takes up very little space and is the neatest way to collect all seasons in one package.

Hopefully there will be a reunion special in the future for the gang.

I would say my husband is wild and sexy like Joey, smart like Ross and Hilarious like Chandler. See? How could someone not like Friends? They are there for you on a calm Friday night to make you laugh, or to cheer you up on a stressful Monday!

Regarding the quality of the DVDs, I have no complaints, the image is good, the sound too, plus you have different language subtitles to practice with.

I bought this whole package because i am an addicted person when it comes to watching Friends... So, to start with, the packaging is amazingly simple. You would want to just feel the cover and look at it for its complex simplicity if i may say...

Inside, you'll find all there is to know about Friends... 60 DVDs of the finest quality, with printed images, and beautifully put. Now i, for instance, never think of the safety of my cds, i don't handle them quite carefully. But, when i got this friends package, i took care of every single dvd there is! After using each one, i cleaned it and put it back very neatly and carefully... So you would want to take care of them as if they're your children!

What i am saying is that this is everything in one thing.. It contains all the special features, gag reels, add-ons, documentaries, interviews, EVERYTHING, and even some things you have never seen on tv!

BUT, you may find some very small problems with the subtitles: for example, some episodes only have Korean subtitles, which disappointed me only a little because i can understand when they talk and i don't much need subtitles... Other than that, they're AWESOME!

So if you're thinking more than once of buying this package, you've thought too much!!!",1178064000,5,1301,4.639130434782609

Friends had a lot of ups and downs, not unusual for a show that ran so long.  At its best the show is laugh at loud funny.  At its worst there are no laughs.  I'd say that the acting is inconsistent too.  J. Aniston had some good episodes, but she overacted in the later years.  I like the Chandler/Monica hookup since it added a storyline where all the characters were involved.  However the engagement scene was not well acted and showed the limitations of Cox and Perry.  I think that Perry has improved though since his acting is much better in the Sorkin drama.

Overall the characters are well defined and the interaction gives the show its unique energy.  The best episodes can be seen over and over,",1174867200,,832,4.450331125827814

It's strange how much I wasn't THAT into Friends when it was on the air, but now I can't get enough of them.  Though Friends cracks me up, episode after episode, it's not really the humor that I find drawing to the show, it's the love that the characters have towards each other.

Obviously, there are specific packaging differences, including both the physical box(es) and any inside booklets. And, I'm aware that both versions have the complete episodic collection. What I'm wondering is if THIS version has the exact same commentary tracks, fun puff piece documentaries, deleted scenes, etc...

In essence, is THIS version going to give me (VIEWING wise) the exact same extras(or perhaps MORE) that the earlier versions had?

Most of my DVDs get transferred into portable CD books, so, as much as I would choose the original box set in regards to the packaging, it isn't worth it to me if I will be watching the exact same EXTRAS.

Thanks in advance to any who answer.",1169510400,,1218,5.07

the value is great, the workmanship of the product is great.

(the only reason, and yes im a butthead i guess, it doesnt get 5 stars is that it could really use a latch on the case to actually KEEP it closed, yes it stays closed on its own, but when you pay as much for this as you do, you should certianly keep it from an ""ACCIDENTAL"" knock-over off a shelf since it doesnt exactly fit where the other DVDs do.)

it is however, mildly annoying how they have the layout of the dvd's packaged, they're packaged by charachater. and then lists the seasons on the charachater package. but it does have a very nice booklet that outlines every epp and every show on each dvd. and is overall a VERY nice product! again, 4 of 5 total stars! a great buy!",1168473600,2,808,4.233766233766234

And settled for this guy here. I love Friends and at least I have a complete set finally.

But the packing is truly disappointing. Cheap cardboard that looks like it won't last more than a few openings. 5 stars for the show. 0 stars for the packaging.

And the thing that really gets me is the discs are divided into 6 sets of disc holders. One holder for each Friend is cute and novel...but a failed gimmick...there are 10 freaking seasons man. It makes no sense that each season wouldn't have it's own holder or box.

I put on a brave smile because I got this as a gift. But I was really dissapointed with the packing.

They had perfection with the wooden box..why mess with it.

If you are purely interested in only the contents of the show...get this. If you want something that feel authentic....skip this cheap knock off and get the real deal wooden box set while it's still available at some places.",1168300800,15,960,4.426136363636363

Each chacters are unnique and in there on ways, can be related by all others. This show is a must for anyone who stills hesitate to see it.

As for this new boxset, I owned both FRIENDS box; The One With All Ten Seasons and The Complete Series. I can garantee you that it worth every penny I paid. Both came with superb package again with different style; it is highly recommended you buy both if you are a true FRIENDS fans.",1166659200,9,567,4.349056603773585
1174880,5,985357456X,"Since I notice all the questions seem to concern the logistics of the set, that is the main thing I will address in this review, since you would have to be a resident of another planet to not know the story behind the series ""Friends"". Suffice it to say it is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the ""post-college adolescent phase"" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you ""settle down"" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.

As for logistics, this collection fits in a sturdy red box that's less than a foot long. There are 40 DVDs containing 236 episodes that can be found inside. The Friends set just has two pieces of the box that comes together. Flipping the top up exposes the guts of the set consisting of 6 books, with one for each Friend. Thus there are only 6 books to hold the 10 seasons. Each book has a picture of the Friend, a number (1-6), and the episodes you can find in each case. The books flip open from the top, and each disc has its own pouch in the double-sided pages. Every disc has a different photo of the Friend, and they're all inserted into the pouches so that the photo is visible as you flip through the book. The disc number and episode numbers are also visible. The contents of the discs are the same as the previous sets, but they have new artwork.

Besides the packaging, there's just one thing to note for this release, that being the episode guide booklet. This 60 page booklet lists every episode with its synopsis and the disc you can find it on. Of course, the bonus material is mentioned along with the disc it can be found on, and the bonus features include 25 documentaries. You'll also get the original treatment for the series written by David Crane and Marta Kauffman. The booklet, which is as wide as the box, can be found behind the DVD books.

As for screen format, it's full screen, which is what Friends was filmed in. The full screen ratio is 4:3, which is the same as 1.33:1. You can record in wide screen and chop off parts of the frame to make it fit a traditional 4:3 TV, which is what is done with full screen editions of movies. However, you can't add stuff to a frame that was recorded in 4:3 and make it widescreen.

There's very little of value here for someone who already has the season 1-10 boxes, and the book with the episode information is just an upgraded version of the booklets that come with the season sets. If you don't already own the 10 seasons then this is an easy way to buy the show since it is a lot cheaper than buying each set individually. It's also nicer than the box set released last year, which was the existing 10 seasons in a big box. If you decide to replace your existing sets then you'll be happy to know the set takes up exactly the same amount of shelf space.",1165708800,715,3243,4.320197044334975
1174881,1,985357456X,"If you are new to friends, there is another complete collection contains all 10 seasons in individual original boxes and a plexy glass limited edition total box. the benefits of that set is, you have all the original DVDs in original boxes which are very good and secure DVD case.

A friend of mine has the entire series, so i used to just borrow it from him and watch it. Ever since then, ive wanted to buy the entire set for myself, but didn't coz, in my opinion, the other set was not worth it. box set didn't look that great, and no extras whatsoever. And worst of all, those discs were dual sided, i hate dual sided discs, real nuisance to maintain!! But when i read abt this a month ago on a dvd news site, i knew i had to get this!! I ordered this set last week, should be here next week, shipping takes a long time, as i live in the UK. oddly enough, there is no information anywhere about a region 2 UK release.

It is at its best in episodes where characters that do not usually spend time together alone end up in a situation together. And unlike most other series, the characters all grow and change over time and it really does keep the show fresh.

Now on to this specific release... I purchased each individual season on DVD when originally released and I have read posts that state this is just new packaging, but are you all sure? I have a few questions:

(1) Are the extras in this release all in the season by season packages?

(2) Are these episodes full screen (Standard) or widescreen (1.33 to 1)?

All the separate packages for the 10 seasons were full screen. I know when the series started widescreen was rather unique in television. I prefer the widescreen but do not want to shell out the bucks for a whole new set if they are all full screen. I would also consider getting the new release if there are new extra featurettes that are different from the original individual season releases.

Does anyone have any information about these 2 concerns?

As always, thanks for any feedback/information.",1164240000,4,1226,4.626728110599078
1174886,4,985357456X,"Some fans of NBC's Friends will begin and end their collection of Friends episodes with this item. Others have already purchased the ten season sets individually. This 1994-2004 sitcom has made big stars out of Jennifer Aniston,Courteney Cox Arquette,Lisa Kudrow,Matt LeBlanc,Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. However,Schwimmer has been out of the public eye mostly since the sitcom ended its run. This might be thought of by some as ""Three's Company times two"",since there are six principal characters. When Friends premiered,other hit sitcoms still in prime-time were Frasier,Fox's Married...With Children,ABC's Roseanne and CBS's Murphy Brown. NBC pulled the plug on Frasier along with Friends. Like on ABC's Three's Company,the six Friends were sharing apartments together to cut back on living expenses. Post-Friends,Aniston has been relentlessly making movies like she has been when the sitcom was still on the air. During the run,in July 2000,she married Brad Pitt,they are now divorced. CCA kept a low profile. Pre-Friends,she had a recurring role as Lauren Miller on another NBC sitcom,Family Ties from 1987 to '89. She co-starred opposite Jim Carrey in his first starring film ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE. When she married David Arquette,she adopted his name. Kudrow currently has a series on Cable TV's Home Box Office. LeBlanc continues his role of Joey Tribbiani on Friends' spinoff Joey. Pre-Friends,he became the star of the MWC not-too-successful spinoff Top Of The Heap opposite Joseph Bologna. Perry,like CCA,maintained a low profile. All six stars have made movies during and after the sitcom's run(Aniston is the most consistent of the six). You can see Aniston in films like OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION,RUMOUR HAS IT and BRUCE ALMIGHTY,to name a few. Perry co-starred with Elizabeth Hurley in the 2002 Paramount comedy SERVING SARA. Schwimmer starred in 1998's KISSING A FOOL. Kudrow co-starred with Mira Sorvino in ROMY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. Also,at least most of the six have guest-hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live on various occasions.

And now they're coming out with another ""Complete Series Collection.""  This is getting ridiculous.  And it's not only happening with the Friends franchise.  Take for example the Lord of the Rings movies, how much ""extra features"" does Peter Jackson have with these movies?  I own the Gift Sets and I've seen at least 3 or so other versions of these movies.  I am a DVD collector, so I like to buy the definitive version of each movie when they come out (or special editions like the giftsets of the LoTR trilogy).  So this frustrates me when one thing comes out and then a year later they think that they can pull the wool over the consumers' collective eyes by repackaging the same thing in a new wrapper.  So for the Peter Jackson's, George Lucas', and the many other studios out there, enough is enough.  Make the first one the best one and cut the greed down a little bit.  Thanks.

What makes FRIENDS better is that it now comes in a collector's edition box which fills me with pride everytime I look at my mantelpiece.

What sweetened the deal for me was that I got it in the first few days of it's release at a prce of $200, with free shipping. I mean, to echo chandler's phrase ""Throw in a tree and a fat man, and you've got Christmas!""

1174909,5,985357456X,"It needs no introduction even to those who never watched it that ""Friends"" is the most popular daily sitcom of all times.  It is a story about six people living together and great friends. All are funny, successful and what they do professionally (except the funniest - Joey), looking for some love, fun, and companionship in their lives (Aren't we all?). The life that is full of challenges and changing relationships, only support and love of your friends can make it easy and sweet.

One thing about this sitcom is that unlike other shows, you never get bored of watching them over and over again. That makes the best reason to buy this collector's set of all the ten seasons. I actually had the season 4 and 7 bought individually, but when I saw this Limited edition set, I just couldn't stop myself. Believe me, no point in buying seasons individually, just buy the whole set if you can and you will never regret it. The fun is when you watch the seasons back to back and you don't even realize that this sitcom was entertaining millions of people around the globe for a decade! That's the beauty of it. Having said that, I don't think paying $300 for this entire set is too much. It will entertain you for few more decades to come!",1139443200,13,1237,4.493333333333333

We argue and we don't speak for a while; but we're forgiving and are always friends because we love each other.  We're closer to each other than we are to family members.

1174914,3,985357456X,"Friends was an entertaining show with characters you cared about that was able to keep a dedicated and loyal fan base for ten seasons -- an enviable achievement for any sitcom. Shows like Bewitched and The Cosby Show limped lamely to the end of their runs and should have left the air years before. But Friends stayed on top for its entire run. For that, Friends deserves its good rep.

However, when NBC, during Friends' final season, started bellowing that its was ""The Greatest Sitcom of all time,"" I balked (especially since Frasier ended its run at around the same time). I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, All in the Family, Maude, The Bob Newhart Show, MASH, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Sanford & Son, Cheers, Seinfeld, The Simpsons, Frasier and Everybody Loves Raymond, to name a few, deserve that title more.

1174916,5,985357456X,"Hi there, Since there aren't any full on info reviews fir this 10-Season Box set here goes a full 10 season synopsis from Wiki:

Season one

We are introduced to Phoebe, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Ross, shortly after Ross's wife Carol has realized she is a lesbian and divorced him. At this point, Monica, Phoebe and Ross all live alone, while Chandler and Joey live together. Monica's old school friend Rachel enters Central Perk wearing a wedding dress, having just run away from her wedding to Barry Farber and needing somewhere to go. She moves in with Monica, gets a job as a waitress at Central Perk, and struggles to work for a living, having previously lived a rich life.

Ross finds his ex-wife Carol is pregnant with his child. In the penultimate episode of the season, she gives birth to a boy, named Ben, who is subsequently raised by Carol and her lover, Susan.

In the pilot, Ross reveals he had a crush on Rachel in high school, and we see (unbeknownst to Rachel) that he still has feelings for her. Throughout the season, he fails to make his feelings known to her, and eventually Chandler and Joey persuade him to move on. In the last episode, on Rachel's birthday, Ross leaves for a paleontological trip to China - while he is gone, Chandler accidentally reveals to Rachel that Ross is in love with her. Rachel eventually decides she would like to start a romantic relationship with Ross, and goes to meet him at the airport when he returns from China, unaware that he is getting off the plane with another woman.

[edit]

Season two

Ross is unaware that Rachel now has feelings for him, and has started a relationship with a paleontologist named Julie whom he knew at grad school and has met again while in China. Rachel is very unhappy about this and makes attempts to sabotage the relationship, eg: when Ross wants to consummate his relationship with Julie, Rachel tells him women find nothing sexier than a man who doesn't want to have sex.

Rachel later goes on a date with another man, where she gets very drunk and leaves a message on Ross's answer machine saying she is over him. Next morning, Ross comes to Monica and Rachel's apartment and plays back the message with their phone. Rachel is forced to admit that she likes Ross, causing Ross to get very confused over his own feelings. He later comes to Rachel at Central Perk and angrily tells her she shouldn't have told him, and he is now over her, but after leaving, he comes back and they kiss passionately. Ross is unable to choose between Rachel and Julie - in the process of making a list of pros and cons for both women, he decides he really loves Rachel, and breaks up with Julie. Unfortunately, Rachel discovers the list of pros and cons he made, becomes angry with Ross and rejects him.

However, later in the season, the group watches a video of Monica and Rachel getting ready for their high school prom. In the video, it looks like Rachel's date isn't going to show, so Ross's parents persuade him to take her instead. But just as Ross is about to, Rachel's date arrives and they leave together. Rachel is touched by this, and decides to start dating Ross after all.

Joey gets a high profile acting job as Dr Drake Ramoray on the soap Days Of Our Lives, and earns enough money to move into his own apartment. Left on his own, Chandler gets a new roommate called Eddie, who turns out to be insane. When Joey states in an interview that he writes his own lines on Days Of Our Lives, the show's writers are offended and kill off his character. With no income for his lavish spending, Joey moves back into Chandler's apartment. Chandler had been struggling to get Eddie to move out due to his mental problems; Eddie continuously forgot that Chandler had asked him to leave. Chandler and Joey solve the problem by moving out Eddie's things, changing the locks, and pretending they don't know Eddie when he comes to the door - Eddie assumes he has the wrong apartment and leaves.

Phoebe finds she has a half brother called Frank, from her father's side.

For a period, Monica goes out with Richard Burke, a friend of her parents' who is significantly older than her. They become very close, but break up in the last episode when Richard tells her he doesn't want to have children with her, having already had them with his ex-wife.

[edit]

Season three

Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and tries to get one in the fashion industry. She meets a man named Mark who gets her a job in Bloomingdale's, but Ross becomes convinced Mark has ulterior motives, and becomes increasingly jealous. Tension between Ross and Rachel culminates on their anniversary, when Rachel is too busy at work to go to dinner with Ross. Instead, Ross brings some food to her work, but gets in the way and she orders him to leave. Back home, the two have an argument which ends in Rachel suggesting they take a break.

Afterward, Ross goes for a drink with Chandler and Joey. Both he and Rachel independently decide to resolve their differences, but when Ross calls Rachel, Mark is there to check if Rachel is all right. Having heard him over the phone, Ross assumes the worst and hangs up. Feeling depressed, he ends up sleeping with a woman named Chloe. He tries to resume his relationship with Rachel without telling her, but she finds out, and after a prolonged argument, they break up.

However, towards the end of the season, Rachel becomes upset when Ross starts dating a woman named Bonnie. In the final episode, the group goes on a beach trip, so Phoebe can meet up with a woman (also named Phoebe) who has information about her family. While at the beach, Bonnie unexpectedly turns up. Rachel is unhappy and persuades Bonnie to shave her head so Ross will be less attracted to her. Ross and Rachel argue about this and start to feel like they still love each other. The episode ends with Ross standing between Rachel and Bonnie's bedrooms, picking one, and going in.

[edit]

Season four

The season begins with Ross entering one room and finding both Rachel and Bonnie. Ross decides to get back together with Rachel, and breaks up with Bonnie. Rachel writes Ross a letter of her feelings about them getting back together. It turns out to be a request that Ross take full responsibility for everything that went wrong last time, which he finds he cannot do, and they quickly break up again.

While still at the beach, Phoebe learns the older Phoebe is actually her real mother. Phoebe tells Ursula, who makes it sound like she knew all along. Ursula produces their mother's ""suicide note"" (which she really wrote herself) which says ""Dear Phoebe and Ursula, I love you both very much. P.S. Your birth mother lives in Montauk.""

Phoebe agrees to be a surrogate mother for her half brother Frank and his infertile wife Alice. Frank and Alice's embryos, conceived by in vitro fertilization, are implanted in Phoebe's uterus and she becomes pregnant with triplets.

Chandler meets a girl named Kathy who originally dates Joey. The latter two, who are classmates in acting class break-up after Kathy kissed Chandler while Joey was outside the apartment. This made Joey angry and as punishment, Chandler was made to stay in a box for several hours to show him [Joey] how much he wants him to be his [Chandler's] friend again. Joey eventually forgives him and Chandler starts going out with Kathy. The relationship however does not last long as Chandler suspects that Kathy is sleeping with a fellow cast member after watching one of her plays. This actually happens after their first fight and they break up.

Chandler & Joey and Monica & Rachel compete in a quiz about each other, put together by Ross, to decide which of them knows more about the other two. The two teams make a bet - if Monica and Rachel win, Chandler and Joey will give up their pets chick and duck, but if Chandler and Joey win, they get Monica and Rachel's apartment. In the end, Chandler and Joey win, and swap apartments with Monica and Rachel. They live like this for a few episodes, then Monica and Rachel try to trade New York Knicks tickets to the boys in exchange for their apartment. Chandler doesn't think it's a fair trade, and they draw cards, with the winner getting the apartment and the tickets. Chandler and Joey win again, but when they get back after the Knicks game, they find the girls have moved all the guys' things back into their original apartment, and moved back into theirs. The boys agree to let living arrangements return to normal when, in exchange, Monica and Rachel kiss each other for one minute in front of them.

Ross meets a British woman named Emily and starts dating her. When it is time for Emily to go back to England, she and Ross don't want to leave each other and they decide to get married. In the last episode, the group travels to London for the wedding - except Phoebe, who is too pregnant, and Rachel, who doesn't want to see Ross get married. At the wedding rehearsal dinner, Monica becomes depressed because she's not married, and a drunken man thinks she's Ross' mother. Chandler comforts her and they end up sleeping together.

Rachel realizes she still loves Ross and decides to go to London and tell him. When she gets there, she sees him with Emily and decides it wouldn't be right to mess things up for him. The wedding goes ahead, but comes to an abrupt halt when Ross says ""I take thee, Rachel"" instead of ""I take thee, Emily"".

[edit]

Season five

Ross and Emily's wedding continues after Ross' faux pas and they are married, but at the reception, Emily argues angrily with Ross and disappears. After everyone has returned to New York, Rachel tells Ross she still loves him and then starts laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation, since he is now married. They both decide to forget it. Emily eventually calls Ross from England and tells him that she will only give the marriage a chance if he promises he will never see Rachel again. Ross agrees, but Emily continues to make unreasonable demands to keep him away from Rachel, such as moving to another apartment. Eventually, he decides the marriage won't work if Emily doesn't trust him and they divorce.

Ross has already sublet his old apartment at this point and can't get it back since the leasee is Emily's cousin, so he lives with Chandler and Joey for a period until he gets a new apartment for himself. He later loses his job at a museum when he gets angry at his boss for eating his Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich.

In the 100th episode (third of the season), Phoebe gives birth to triplets - a boy named Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls named Leslie and Chandler (they had originally thought it would be two boys and a girl, and Phoebe was going to name one boy after Chandler). Phoebe tries to keep one after becoming attached to them, but finds out that Frank and Alice are unwilling to give up a child.

After sleeping together in London, Chandler and Monica feel attracted to each other and continue an intimate relationship in secret. Joey finds out about it, but keeps it a secret for them. Rachel then finds out, but after she tells Monica and Monica denies it, Rachel pretends to be oblivious. Phoebe is the next to find out. However, rather than keeping it a secret or pretending to be oblivious, she plays mind games with Chandler by pretending she is attracted to him. When Chandler and Monica realize she knows about them, Chandler pretends he is attracted to Phoebe, but eventually confesses he is in love with Monica. Ross finds out shortly afterwards, and Chandler and Monica's relationship becomes public.

Rachel gets a new job at Ralph Lauren.

Towards the end of the season, Joey gets the lead in a movie, but travels to Las Vegas to find production has shut down due to lack of money. In the last episode, Chandler, Monica and Phoebe travel to Las Vegas to see him (he has stayed there waiting for production to restart, but has been lying to them, telling them he is filming for the movie), with Ross and Rachel following them later. They find Joey working as a Roman guard in the Caesar's Palace hotel lobby. On the plane there, Ross draws a mustache on Rachel's face with a felt tip pen - Rachel can't get it off and doesn't want to leave her hotel room, so Ross stays with her. They both get very drunk and Rachel draws on his face in return.

Chandler and Monica decide to get married in a Las Vegas chapel, but just before they do, they encounter Ross and Rachel, still drunk, who have just wed at the same chapel.

[edit]

Season six

In the opening credits of the first episode of this season, every name is followed by the word ""Arquette"", in reference to Courteney Cox' marriage to David Arquette (and subsequent name change to ""Courteney Cox Arquette"").

After finding out that they are now married, Ross and Rachel agree to get an annulment, but Ross doesn't want to have been divorced three times and lies to Rachel, telling her he has had the marriage annulled when he actually hasn't. Rachel eventually learns the truth and forces Ross to go ahead with the annulment, but they are unable to get one as Rachel has added humiliating misinformation about Ross on the form, and they are forced to file for divorce.

Ross gets a new job teaching paleontology at New York University (NYU).

Despite his divorce record, Ross dates two people: Jill Green, Rachel's sister and Elizabeth Stevens, a student in one of his NYU classes. Jill comes into the city to goes to Rachel to help her look for a job after her father takes away her credit card and in her job hunt, there seems to be a spark with Ross when one of the items she bought at a store isn't confiscated by Rachel. Neither one was planning to ask the other out but when Rachel accidentally says it's OK, Jill asks Ross out and he agrees. But Rachel's true feelings about her sister and ex-boyfriend started to be known to both and she forces Ross to stop seeing Jill. Meanwhile, with Elizabeth, Ross discovers that she is the one who rated him a ""hottie"" in her evaluation form. They start dating despite a university policy that makes it illegal for a teacher to date a student and threats from Ross' colleagues and Elizabeth's father that Ross will be fired for violating that policy. Ross tries to impress Elizabeth's father, Paul but is usually unsuccessful. They break up after Ross figures that there is no future between them.

Chandler and Monica decide it's too soon for them to get married, and decide to move in together instead. Chandler moves into Monica's apartment, Rachel moves in with Phoebe, and Joey is left on his own.

After Chandler moves out, Joey gets a sexy female roommate named Janine. After a few weeks of carefully avoiding the subject, the two start dating, but the relationship doesn't last long when Janine tells Joey she doesn't like Monica and Chandler. Joey's attempts to make them get along only make the situation worse and Janine moves out.

Another interesting aspect of season 6 is Joey's money and career crisis. First Joey, not getting an acting job in a long time loses his insurance. He gets it back by getting a part in a movie which he acted as a dying father. Joey finds it very difficult to keep up with the bills living on his own and as a result of Janine moving out, Joey's telephone and cable service has been cutoff and desperate for money, Joey gets a job at Central Perk. He later tries other ways to get money like participate in a study for identical twins but isn't successful as he and his partner, Tony, aren't identical twins. Also, Joey gets a job as the lead actor on a new TV Series named 'Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.', which revolves around a detective and his robot sidekick. Joey promptly quits his job at Central Perk.

Later in the season, a fire wrecks Phoebe and Rachel's apartment. It is assumed that Phoebe's candles started the fire, so while Rachel moves in with Chandler and Monica, Phoebe moves into the less savory conditions of Joey's apartment. However, when the firemen find the fire was actually started by Rachel leaving a hair straightener switched on in the bathroom, Phoebe and Rachel swap. Rachel finds living with Joey quite enjoyable, while Phoebe is annoyed by Monica's constant attention and obsession with cleanliness.

Towards the end of the season, Chandler plans to propose to Monica. In the final episode, he fails to propose at a restaurant when Richard, Monica's ex-boyfriend, appears. Later, Richard meets Monica at her workplace and tells her he still loves her. She considers going back to Richard when Chandler pretends he isn't interested in marriage (so she'll be surprised when he proposes) but Joey explains the situation to her. She decides to surprise him with a proposal and he says yes.

[edit]

Season seven

The season mainly focuses on Monica and Chandler's wedding plans from the selection of the maid of honour to the wardrobe to the seating arrangement. It was almost thrown in jeopardy when Monica's parents spent all the money from the Monica Wedding fund to acquire a beach house. Chandler agreed to give some money.

Rachel gets a promotion in Ralph Lauren and one of its perks includes hiring a new assistant. She hires Tag Jones (as opposed to an experienced applicant), who she has a crush on from the moment she meets him. They got together on Thanksgiving but broke up during her birthday.

Phoebe and Rachel's apartment is restored after the fire. Phoebe moves back in on her own, while Rachel continues living with Joey.

'Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.' is a ratings failure and is quickly cancelled, but luckily for Joey he is offered his job back on Days Of Our Lives.

In the final episode, it is time for Chandler and Monica's wedding, but the night before, Chandler gets cold feet and disappears. While he is gone, Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in Monica's bathroom, and assumes Monica is pregnant. Phoebe and Ross find Chandler at his office and persuade him to come back, but Chandler overhears Phoebe and Rachel talking about Monica's ""pregnancy"" and disappears again. He quickly returns on his own, however, deciding that a baby wouldn't be so bad. Chandler and Monica get married, but when Chandler tells Monica he knows about the baby, she says she isn't pregnant, and it wasn't her pregnancy test that Phoebe found. As the episode ends, it is hinted that it is actually Rachel who is pregnant.

[edit]

Season eight

It is confirmed that Rachel is pregnant, and in the second episode, the group finds out that Ross is the father (we learn they secretly slept together before Chandler and Monica's wedding). Her pregnancy becomes the central focal point of the eighth season.

Ross met Mona at the wedding and went out with her for a few months but they broke up because of complications arising from his impending fatherhood with Rachel's child.

As Rachel and Joey continue living together, Joey starts to develop feelings for her. Feeling that Ross is missing out on his fatherly duties, Joey reluctantly suggests that Rachel move in with Ross, and she does so. Joey later reveals his feelings to Rachel, who politely rejects him.

In the last episode, Rachel goes into labor, and while she's in the hospital Ross's mother approaches him with a ring to give to Rachel. Ross demures, saying it's far too complicated, but keeps the ring in his coat pocket. After Rachel gives birth to their daughter, Emma, Joey goes in to see how Rachel is doing and accidentally knocks over Ross's coat. The engagement ring falls out, and Joey bends down to pick it up. Rachel, seeing Joey on one knee with an engagement ring, thinks that he's proposing to her, and says that she'll marry him.

Also in the last episode, Monica and Chandler decide to try for a baby of their own.

[edit]

Season nine

Ross, Rachel, and Emma continue living together until they have a argument about their current relationship. Feeling it may not be right that she is living with Ross, and they have a baby together, but they are not in a relationship, Rachel decides to move back in with Joey, taking Emma with her.

Chandler's job starts requiring him to spend the better part of the week in Tulsa. He puts up with this for a while, but when he finds himself working in Tulsa over Christmas, and a female associate (played by Selma Blair) comes on to him, he quits his job, and later gets one in advertising.

Chandler and Monica try to conceive a baby of their own, but fail to do so. They go to a fertility clinic and find they are both infertile, so decide to adopt a baby.

Phoebe starts dating a man named Mike Hanigan (Paul Rudd). They become close and decide to move in together, but when Phoebe asks about the future of their relationship, Mike tells her that since he has already been through a failed marriage, he doesn't want to get married again. Phoebe does want to get married, so they break up.

Towards the end of the season, Rachel begins to develop feelings for Joey.

In the final episode, the group goes to Barbados, where Ross is giving a paleontological talk. Phoebe takes her boyfriend David (whom she first met in the first season and got back together with in the previous episode) and Joey takes his girlfriend Charlie (another professor of paleontology whom Ross had welcomed to the city). Monica learns David is planning to top Mike by proposing to Phoebe, and calls Mike to tell him to get back together with Phoebe. Mike originally doesn't want to intervene, but later comes to Barbados and tells Phoebe he loves her and wants to marry her. Phoebe rejects Mike's proposal, but still resumes her relationship with him, letting David down gently.

Joey and Charlie break up when they decide they have too little in common, and Joey subsequently learns Rachel has feelings for him. He originally decides not to act on it. Meanwhile, Charlie feels she still likes Ross, and they kiss. Joey sees them doing so, changes his mind about Rachel, and goes to her room and kisses her.

[edit]

Season ten

Joey and Rachel's intimate relationship only lasts for the first three episodes of the season, at which point they find that since their relationship has been platonic for so long, they are too uncomfortable getting physical with each other, and decide to be just friends again.

Ross and Charlie on the other hand went through a relationship that started in Barbados and it went well until she decides to get back together with an ex-boyfriend who administers a grant review Ross hopes to get.

As the season goes on, Mike proposes to Phoebe again, and they get married in a later episode. In the final episode, Phoebe and Mike decide to try for a baby.

Chandler and Monica apply to adopt the baby of a pregnant woman named Erica and also decide to move out of their apartment into a house in the suburbs. In the final episode, Erica gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl, who are named Jack (after Monica's dad) and Erica (after Erica).

Rachel goes for an interview for Gucci, but her Ralph Lauren boss is at the same restaurant where the interview takes place, and fires her and in addition, she does not get the Gucci job. While moving out her things, she runs into Mark (from the third season) who gets her a new job - in Paris. The other friends hold a going-away party for Rachel and she says goodbye to each of them in turn, except Ross. He is upset about this until Rachel tells him it was too hard to say goodbye to him. They then sleep together.

In the final episode, Ross realizes he still loves Rachel, and after she leaves for the airport to go to Paris, he goes after her to tell her. When he catches up with her and lets her know, she originally rejects him. Ross gets back to his apartment and finds a message from Rachel on his answering machine, telling him she does still love him and is trying to get off the plane. As the message ends, she arrives at Ross' apartment, and they kiss.

The final episode ends with Chandler and Monica moving out of their apartment, and everyone going for one last coffee at Central Perk.

I do love Friends and the set itself is very nice, I am just concerned about the sound quality.

I will point out that I have been watching the re-runs for quite some time on numerous networks and cable and there are episodes that are rarely, if ever, shown in syndication.  Such as the one in the laundromat with Ross and Rachael or where Nana dies (and people think Chandler's gay).  I see the pilot often, but not these older episodes very often.

1174932,5,985357456X,"Friends, one of the greatest sitcoms in the history of television and one of the most loved. Today I picked up the last box set and am now the proud owner of The One With All Ten Seasons. From the very beginning of the show's remarkable ten year run, America and the rest of the world became somewhat attached to the lives of Rachel, Ross, Chandler, Phoebe, Monica and Joey. We gladly accepted them with open arms. What a breath of fresh air the show was thanks to the talented writers, producers, directors and a cast that will never be duplicated. Not even close. As I sat and watched the start of the tenth season(again), I thought to myself, no wonder this show lasted so long. The chemistry of these six fine actors who were virtually unknown when they started this show, became household names with good reason and the stories were so well written and real. We eventually felt as if they were are old friends that would always be there for us. They were for ten years. During the run of the show, we've all had our own ups and downs, our hopes and dreams ,and grew older and learned a lot about life just as our Friends did. Those of us who were in our 20's and 30's just like our Friends were, knew or got the jokes more than others may have... But they were there to let all the others understand what it meant to be a young adult trying to start your own life(in this crazy world) along with all those obstacles that get in the way again and again. The humor in Friends was that it was okay to laugh at your own mistakes. It was okay to laugh with your friends, not at them. The love and support these characters showed and had for each other, for those of us who watched, will always be embedded in our minds. We loved Friends and now with the tenth and final season in our homes, we know that we can laugh with our Friends when we need them. We know that they will be there for us, always...",1132012800,,1902,4.228021978021978
1174933,5,985357456X,"Friends is a sit com with a simple premise.  It follows six friends as they deal with the challenges of early adulthood in New York City.

Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled woman learning to live on her own for the first time.  Her roommate Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette) is a clean freak chef.  Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer) is a nerdy paleontologist.  Across the hall from Monica and Rachel are Chandler (Matthew Perry), a sarcastic office worker, and struggling actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc).  Rounding out the group is free spirit Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) who makes her living as a message therapist and freelance guitarist.  They are usually hanging out at an apartment or the coffee house they all love, Central Perk.

Over the course of ten seasons, the show managed to get all the characters through a lot of trials.  They all had many romantic relationships start and fail and all were out of work at one point or another.  Through it all, the friends stuck by each other.

Those friendships are one of the things that continue to draw me to the show.  With a few exceptions, any squabbles will be patched up by the time the half hour is over.  If only friends stayed this close in real life.

And of course, the show is funny.  From Chandler's one-liners to Joey's ignorant statements of fact or Monica's desire for order, these characters could be counted on to make you laugh.

The one storyline that stretches from the pilot to the finale is Ross and Rachel's romantic relationship.  They almost get together and break up so many times, it gets frustrating after a while.  Their relationship is a main focus of the early seasons, but begins to take a back seat to other storylines as the series progresses.  Except, of course, when it's time for a season cliffhanger.  All but one season ended with some twist to the story.  Frankly, it got a little tiresome by the end, but it only detracts a little.

Maybe dragging out the Ross/Rachel storyline is one reason for it, but the later seasons do loose a little of their charm.  The early seasons had a warmth to them that later seasons seemed to loose.  I find I enjoy watching the earlier seasons better then the later ones even though the later ones are still entertaining and funny.  Later seasons do, for example, feature Phoebe finding a man to marry and Monica and Chandler's marriage and struggles with having kids.  And, of course, there's Joey's triumphant return to Days of Our Lives and movie debut.

This set has everything a fan could want.  All ten seasons of the show are here with a collectable cover to keep the smaller sets in.  The episodes features original full frame picture and 5.1 surround sound.  Scenes cut to make room for commercials are included, some for the first time.  In addition, each set contains interviews, commentary, blooper reels, set tours, trivia challenges, and other behind the scenes fun.

For any fan of Friends who has put off getting the DVD's, this collection is a dream come true.  The outer collector shell is the only things those buying them all along are missing, and information about ordering it separately is available is the season 10 set.",1132012800,55,3169,4.714025500910747

So when I went to the store today and bought season ten, imagine my happiness when I found a coupon inside to buy just the box for $20(with s/h)

1174938,5,985357456X,"Most true blue fans know this show backwards and forwards. However there are new fans discovering this Jem of a Show everyday and here are a few reasons why you should invest in this series. First of all $200 dollars for all ten seasons is too good of a deal to pass up, not to mention the collectors box looks great. This show treated the sets as characters much like the bar in Cheers was a character in itself. The coffee shop (Central Perk) was a vivid, evolving, living set filled with color and art by well known New York artists. Friends' ongoing jokes and plot lines helped make its ten year run one big thread about six people and the lives they'd built. Friends was one of the finest thanks to the colorful detailed sets, the great A-list guest, the fantastic writing, the many catchphrases that has become a part of our everyday vocabulary, and the inspiring cast of six wonderful actors that as a group made something very special. Shows like this may never come around again. The situation comedy is now evolving into shows like Aressted Development, Desperate Houswives, and My Name Is Earl which are folowing the M*A*S*H format minus the laugh track. This show along with a few others such as Cheers, Seinfeld, Frasier,were tuly the pinnacal of the situation comedy. As it had been done since the days of The Honeymooners and I Love Lucy. The sitcom, with a set on a soundstage is becoming an extinct medium and until another show comes around to revive the medium, much as The Cosby Show did when it debuted. I think that Friends will be remembered as one of the last great situation comedies of all time.",1130457600,30,1621,4.573883161512027

Every television series puts out a complete boxed set when all the seasons are released onto DVD.  This is for collectors and people who don't own all the seasons.

The full collection just gives those of us who've been waiting on it a slightly better average per season cost (instead of $24-$30, we end up getting it at $21) but that is about it.  I'm ecstatic they are finally doing this, I've been holding out for this since about 2 years ago when it all ended.  Hope everyone enjoys it.",1127779200,,686,4.5

There will be a mail in coupon inserted into the season 10 boxset, so those who have been loyally buying each DVD set will not need to purchase this 10-season boxset just to get the box.

I only started watching 'Friends' seriously in June of last year, when I decided to buy season 1 on DVD. Pretty soon, I had all 7 seasons that were available, and was anxious to get the next seasons. 'Friends' is a witty sitcom with characters that everyone will come to love. Sure, it's had its low points, but in my opinion, it's been pretty rewarding to follow this series loyally. I personally enjoy watching episodes with more emotional storylines, because that's where you see how well these actors portray their characters.

Those of you that are like me remember that when the first 3 seasons came out they went for a whopping $50 to $60 dollars a piece.

I've seen pictures of the new box set for all ten seasons and it's gorgeous.  It would look really nice in anyone's collection including my own but for us that have the box sets already, I could kind of see a compromise being an option like a coupon or discounted price for proof of purchase for those of us that have them already.

I would hope that Warner Bros. would see my post and maybe consider this option for not just myself but the rest of us who have stayed loyal to their merchandise and products for years.

It is well-written and perfectly acted by a fantastic ensembel cast. This was the show that introduced us to Ms. Jennifer Aniston, the most beautiful woman in the world (IMHO). Sadly, now that she is available, I'm married. (Kidding!)

Dave Schwimmer cracks me up. They all do, in fact. Especially Lisa Kudrow, the classic dumb blonde. She says such stupid things that she is even wise sometimes, like Yogi Berra.

For everyone's clarification: This box set is meant for all those people who either waited (for what?) or consumers who are looking for that particular gift for the holiday season (someone who likes Friends, but never took the time to buy them on DVD) I own the previous 9 seasons, and if you're complaining about the lack of bonus features now, then where have you been? And even if for this box set did have an extra one hour featurette, that would not warrent purchasing it if you already own the series. As it stands though, there is nothing extra with this set, either than the box, which by the way, can be shipped to you for the price of shipping (and the proof of purchase tabs) if you already own the nine other seasons (and if you purchase the 10th)

As for the product, as I have watched every episode of Friends on DVD prior to the finale season more than once, I can say with assurance that buying this is not a waste. There are very few extra features, and the video quality sometime suffers in earlier seasons (as was the limit), but the sound is spectacular throughout. The quality of the show, depending on who you ask, varies. Some prefer the former of the series, while others marvel at the latter.

1174969,2,985357456X,"My family & I are HUGE fans of FRIENDS. We own all ten seasons as well as every other Spec Ed DVD collection, and watch them often. Before anyone complains about my ""2 star"" rating and/or accuses me of whining about its release (after we bought each season separately), let me explain the reason behind my rating......

I'm not giving this a 2-star rating because I'm mad about having bought all ten seasons separately.  I'm giving the PRODUCT 2 stars as I don't really see any product here at all - This collection consists of the same nine seasons previously released, all boxed up together, along with the recently released Season 10. There isn't any new material or special ""extras"" included with this collection, which in my opinion, makes it a waste of money and a missed opportunity. Why the rush to release this series collection? Why not release Season 10 this year and wait a year before releasing the entire series with added features and bonus material? This way, fans of FRIENDS would still have had something to look forward to.  Now that it's all been released (Season 10, as well as the series collection), fans have nothing new to add to their collections.  There was so much that could have been added to this set - additional outtakes, deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews, music, fashion, a special ed book, etc. Not even the one hour retrospect, THE ONE BEFORE THE LAST ONE, that was originally shown the night of the finale is included in this collection (or any individual season for that matter). Looks like fans will never be able to own that special on any DVD collection, which makes me so mad! I would so rather go back & watch that one hour special again & again, than watch all ten openings from every season (which was included on the Series Finale DVD)! Who's bright idea was that?!?

I'm sure it will be nice to have all 10 seasons, packaged together in one boxed set. But the only thing new here is the Special Ed. Collector's box that the set comes packaged in, which is made available for its own separate purchase in the Season 10 collection. It would have made more sense to release Season 10 this year, with only season 10 bloopers & outtakes, THE ONE BEFORE THE LAST ONE, and the other bonus features that are included. Then wait a year and release the Series Collection, with an added bonus disc could that could have included bloopers & outtakes from all ten seasons, as well as other added material & extras - perhaps, the cast's appearances on the Oprah show (from the show's beginning and the end) as well as their appearance on the Tonight Show from the night the finale aired; a look back at how each of the cast members/characters changed & grew throughout the years and what each one has been doing since the series ended; all of the big-name guest stars, the various sets & scene locations, fashions & costumes throughout the series; maybe even a special ed book. There are so many things that could have been added, had the producers just taken their time and really thought about what the fans would want.

Earlier this summer, when it was announced that all 6 seasons of Sex & the City were being released, I thought, ""That's kinda strange. Most fans have already purchased all 6 seasons, why would they want to buy them all over again?"" And when I heard that the set was going to cost $300 - well, I thought, ""That's just ridiculous!"" Each individual season costs $20-30 (approx. $200 for all 6 seasons). Why would anyone want to spend $100 more just to own the full set in one box? But then I found out that the Full Series Collection would have lots of ""extras"" not found on the individual season discs, including a deluxe velvet box and a small ""companion"" book. For the average fan, it's probably not worth it to spend the extra money for whatever the extras are, but for the serious fan and/or collector - that's a big deal. Now it made sense to me, and will hopefully be worth the additional cost. But this isn't true about the Full Series Collection of Friends. There are no special extras in this set. The ""One with all Ten Seasons"" is packaged with the same exact discs sold individually as Seasons 1-10. What a waste!

I just think that this is a missed opportunity to give fans of FRIENDS something ""special"". If you're going to release a Spec Collector's Edition of all ten seasons, then there should be some added material, bonus features or something that generates a little excitement and makes the fans want to run right out and buy it. It's really a shame, because as big as FRIENDS was and how many fans of the show there still are, there is so much more that could have been included and given to fans - maybe WB & the producers of FRIENDS should have borrowed some ideas from HBO and the producers of Sex & the City. I bet the Sex collection easily outsells the FRIENDS collection just because of all the added material.",1124755200,18,4894,4.548240635641316

1174974,5,985357456X,"Friends(1994-2004) has not only became NBC's benchmark show for nearly a decade,but an endearing, and somewhat screwball look at late 20/early 30 somethings gained even more new fans today from syndication and DVD sets.

Unlike most shows in their first seasons,Friends felt like it was at it's peak,althought it was only the beginning. Thanks to brilliant writing that doesn't talk down to most 20 something at the time(although the creators were mid 30's plus).Another contributing factor were the distinctive characters themselves,Including the wound up,yet nuturing Monica Gellar(Courtney Cox<Arquette>),her brilliant,yet nerdy brother Ross(David Schwimmer),The spoiled,yet endearing Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston)who becomes Monica's roommate after becoming a runaway bride,The sarcastic,uptight Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry),The dopey,loveable out of work actor Joey Tribbiani(Matt LeBlanc)and the sweet,yet ditzy new age hippie Phoebe Buffay(Lisa Kudrow).

The best episodes include The One with the Thumb(Chandler's Smoking),The One with the Blackout,The One with the Boobies,The One with the Candy Hearts(featuring Chandler's loveably annoying on/off girlfriend Janice<Maggie Wheeler>)The One with all the Poker,and The One where Rachel Finds Out(..about Ross's feeling for her).

After a phenomenal debut season like Friends,most shows coast on it's success and start to slip in quality. But Friends would only get better with each successive season.

Changes were in the air for the group. Joey joined the cast of Days Of Our Lives as the ill fated Dr. Drake Ramoray,we meet Phoebe's ex husband (Steve Zahn),Chandler gets a new roommate(Adam Goldberg)who turns out to be a psycho,and Monica falls in love with her dad's best friend Dr. Richard Burke(Tom Selleck).The seasons driving force is the beginning of the on/off again relationship between Rachel and Ross. Many classic episodes came from this season including The One where Heckles Dies,...the Baby on the Bus,...where Ross Finds Out,...the List,...where Ross and Rachel ... You Know,...where Dr. Ramoray Dies and ...Two Parties.

But also from season two was The One With The Prom Video,considered the greatest Friends episode ever. Not only are we treated to a plot involving a hidious bracelet Joey gives to Chandler,but an old video of Rachel and Monica's prom. Giving a glimpse into to past at an overwieght Monica,a pre-nose job Rachel,and an extremely dorky Ross(""Looking Good Mr. Kotter).The most surprising moment is after the viewing of the video, one of those special moments why Friends beloved by it's many fans.

The Third season of Friends would always be remembered as the year Ross and Rachel broke up,showing that the writers would shake up the show to keep it fresh and on it's feet.

In this season,the ups and downs of love effects the other characters. Monica's heartbreak after the break up with Richard,Chandler's short term relationship with Janice,Lothario Joey falling for his play's co-star(Dina Meyer),and even Phoebe reunites with her musical partner(E.G. Daily).

The best episodes includes The One with The Princess Leia Fantasy,..Where No One's Ready(Going Commando),..with the Flashback,...the Giant Poking Device,...the Football, .. where Chandler can't Remember which Sister,..without the Ski Trip,and..Ultimate Fighting Champion.

The unofficial two part The One where Ross and Rachel Take a Break/ the Morning After was the high point of the season in which Ross and Rachel take a break,only to break up when Ross spends the night with Chloe,""The copy girl"".The episode includes some of the funniest moments as well as the most heartbreaking.

Although relationships were still an issue in the fourth season of Friends,Thrown into the mix were Chandler's cure for Monica's Jellyfish Stings,Phoebe Uterus,an apartment switch,Chandler's Thanksgiving inside a box,Ross's musical ""sound"",Wedding dresses,free adult TV and Joey's ballroom dancings takes the show to hilarious levels.

The season sees both Ross and Rachel make up,then shortly break-up(""WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!)only to find themselves in new relationships,Chandler fall in love with Joey's new girlfriend,Phoebe agreeing to carry her brother Frank Jr.'s triplets,and Monica and Chandler finally consumating their relationship.

The best episodes include The One with the Jellyfish,..with the Dirty Girl,..Chandler Crosses the Line/In A Box,.with the Embryos,..Ross's Wedding(I take thee Rachel<!!!!>).

The fourth season cliffhanger (Ross saying Rachel's name in his vows,as well as the Monica/Chandler plot) promises a great following season .

Season five was somewhat of a transitional time on Friends as the Chandler/Monica thing heats up as well as the actors finally settling into their character that would continue to this day,usually a parody into themselves.

Ross gets in over his head thanks to his shrewish new wife,Emily and his sandwich,Phoebe gives birth to her brother's triplets,Joey lands a role in an independent movie,and Rachel's career moves brings her up in the world,while relationships get her down.

The best episodes include The One with all the Kissing,..The Hundredth Episode,..the Thanksgiving Flashbacks,...all the Resolutions,...where Everybody Finds Out,...the Ride Along,and The One in Vegas. Even with some signs of wear on the show,Friends fifth season is a lot better than most sitcoms of it's time

The sixth season of Friends was a turning point in the show as the character grow up and go through various transitions. Even though the sixth doesn't measure up to past seasons,the show is still as reliable on laughs.

Monica and Chandler move in together,jarring the winning chemestry a bit. The winning pairing of former roommates Joey and Chandler takes on a new direction. Ross struggles with his third marriage(to Rachel),and Phoebe is still the only reliable constant.

The classic episodes include The One where Phoebe Runs,....Ross's Teeth,....the Routine,....Unagi,...and....That Could Have Been.

Even after seasons five and six's dip in the show's quality,Friends sixth season still maintained the TV viewer love of this classic ensemble.

Season Seven of Friends is considered the weakest ever compared to the quality of the earlier seasons. It was the year leading up to Chandler and Monica's wedding. But with some weak plots, and Matthew Perry's fluctuating physical appearence, the show seemed on the verge of fatigue.

Despite such shortcomings, the season boasted such episodes as ...The One with Phoebe's Cookies,... the Engagement Picture,...all the Candy,...all the Cheesecakes,...they all Turn Thirty,...Ross and Monica's Cousin,and Monica and Chandler's Wedding.

Just when you think season seven ends with two shark jumping elements (a wedding and pregnancy), The following season bounces back in a way unexpected for any eighth season (if a show even gets that far).Although season seven was the weakest in terms of Friends other seasons, it was still alot funnier than most shows on the air at the time.

Season Eight has the show bouncing back and becoming more sucessful than ever.

After ending with a wedding, and a pregnancy(two definate Jump The Shark moments),the show uses these two plots to good effects as Monica and Chandler deal with their first year as a married couple, and Rachel carries Ross's baby. Adding to the mix is Joey falling in love with Rachel.

Premiering after 9/11,the eighth season of Friends took on a deeper meaning to it's fan as it kept up the laughs as the nationed kept up hope in the wake of disaster.

Season Nine of Friends was originally suppose to be the final season,but was extended for another. The season dealt with Ross and Rachel's new role as parents to baby Emma,Chandler and Monica's attempt to have their own, Phoebe meeting her soon to be husband Mike (Paul Rudd),and Joey dealing with his feelings for Rachel.

The classic episodes include The One With-Where No One Proposes,...Phoebe's Birthday Dinner,...Rachel's Other Sister(with Christina Applegate),...The Lottery,...,In Barbados (featuring Aisha Tyler as Charlie).

Whereas most shows are creatively bankrupt by it's tenth season(with the exception of the Simpsons),Friends manages to have some inspired moments although it's obvious this show has long since seen better days.

Aside from the season only having 18 episodes,the season's biggest flaw is knowing the end is near, and wrapping up things in a tidy package. The best episode (obviously) is the Finale whereas we know the fate of Ross and Rachal,seeing it unfold is one of the most inspired moments of the entire series. Other classic episodes include TOW...Ross'Tan,...The Late Thanksgiving,...Phoebe's Wedding,and ...The Goodbye Party.

After ten years, 236 episodes, and more classic moments than any show could have given us,Friends will live on in not only Re-runs,DVDs and spinoffs(Joey), but in the hearts of those that it has touched.",1123977600,59,8943,5.54886113152094

Later in the series Chandler strikes up a relationship with Monica Gellar, the ex-fatty, neurotic, neat-freak. Monica is known for being extremelly well-organized, and reminising about her days as a fatty. Monica's brother is Ross Gellar, an intelligent Paleantologist who has to put up with all of his freinds insults, and jokes. since the first season he and Rachel Greene have been having an on-agin-off-again relationship. Rachel starts in the series as the typical daddy's girl who just stood up for herself to make a name for herself. She moves in with old high school friend Monica Gellar, and all the Friends begin their bonding.

Please insert a different disc.""So when i went back on to retirn it, it now says.. Return is no longer availible.. But ive only had it enough time to not even watch the first season back to back. I didn't even get to see the last disc of the 1st S. AMOZON NAILED ME TO THE WALL AND RAN WITH MY $81 with tax and mailing fees as well.
