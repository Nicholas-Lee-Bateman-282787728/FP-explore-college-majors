7793339,5,0883479001,The set is excellent. I hope that I will find it in DVD,1485561600,,55,3.3076923076923075
7793340,5,0883479001,"Wonderful re-living the spirit of the 60's. The Church has a 2000 year history of renewal followed by periods of retreat and retrench. The combination of the pedophelia, Vatican Bank, Curia issues, among others...we have once again moved into a retreat and retrench which delights all that fear change. It's a sad time in the Church. This series is the best out there capturing the time and spirit of hope the Second Vatican Council provided. I would definitely recommend the series.",1369353600,2,483,4.9753086419753085
7793341,1,0883479001,"It's kind of stunning that this is the best documentary that Vatican II supporters were able to assemble. Conservatives should know that it is biased towards liberals, and liberals should know that it is a sort of mockery. Over the course of five long videos, they ask liberal experts to assess how Vatican II happened and its impact on the Church. There is no additional narration. According to one expert, for example, the assembly divided into conservatives chanting ""Backwards Christian Soldiers"" and liberals saying ""arrivederci Roma"". But, he insists immediately after, ""we shouldn't divide this into black hats and white hats"". Among other facts, we learn (and remember, this is from ONLY the liberal experts, who are constantly criticizing conservatives):

1. Before Vatican II, the Church was quite strong, the schools and chapels were full, etc. People did not really see the need for it. A period newsreel informs us that ""the Church is not in a state of crisis right now; this is not a council of crisis, but of opportunity"".
2. Before Vatican II, there was an ""enormous cohesion"" in the Church; ""if one was injured, we all bled"". Then ""John XXIII did something for us"".
3. Having the priest turn to face the people was ""quite awkward"".
4. The Xavier Rynne debacle is described without explaining *why* the guy's articles were so controversial.

There's also footage of various ""modern"" services where people do things like join hands and stand in a circle while singing folk songs, or strumming on guitars. Including old women watching a ""rock-and-roll mass"" nervously. Seriously, this is part of the Vatican II PROMOTION video.

If I were rating this as a film, I'd give it 5 stars for comedy value. It's nonsensical and self-incriminating. As religious material, though, it would be upsetting to the faithful.",1330646400,9,1824,5.033112582781457
7793342,5,0883479001,"This five-part video includes interviews with key participants and observers at Vatican II, including the secretary of Pope John XXIII and Xavier Rynne, whose reports from Vatican II in the New Yorker magazine created a sensation and were later printed as a book,  Vatican Council II .  It also includes interviews with later apologists for the changes wrought by Vatican II, including Richard McBrien.  The video is not unbiased: attempts by rock star Pope John Paul II to squelch political activism are presented with obvious disapprobation, and attempts by conservative theologians to claim that Vatican II didn't actually change anything are ignored.  Still, you can't beat this video for getting to the sources and for portraying the spirit of the council and the new energy that Vatican II gave to most of the Catholic church.",1308528000,13,832,5.140740740740741
7793343,1,0883479001,"After having watched the first installment of this 5 VHS tape series, so far it is decidedly biased and in some cases not factual.  For example, one priest being interviewed states that Vatican II turned the priest ""versus populum.""  Nowhere in the council documents will this innovation be found, in fact it is the product of novel experimentation by dissident European bishops with no sanction by the Vatican whatsover.  The same priest, extolling the Mass with priest facing the people, completely misrepresents the pre-Vatican II liturgy, celebrated ""ad orientem"", by saying that the priest never faced the people.  Boulderdash!  The priest faces the people when reading Scripture and delivering the homily (in the vernacular), when praying the ""orate fratres"", when pronouncing the ""Ecce, Agnus Dei"", when distributing Communion, when giving the final blessing.  Right now, the ""Tridentine"" Mass is rapidly gaining public acceptance and preference in light of the violence and defacement which the Liturgy has suffered at the hands of those who use Vatican II as license to destroy the Faith.

Given the ruinous state of the Western Catholic churches in particular, I'm frankly tired of clerics gleefully consigning the Faith to oblivion with a Pollyanna, ""no-downside"" endorsement of Vatican II, while concurrently failing in both teaching and leadership.  Look at the current scandals of active homosexuality in the priesthood, ""Catholic"" politicians who enforce radical anti-life agendas, openly dissident bishops and theologians, etc.

While I am not invalidating the council nor its dogmatic constitutions, neither am I failing to acknowledge the destructive fallout due to those who wrested (and who continue to wrest) the council's declarations in order to foist upon the faithful a ""catholicism"" which, in effect, is hostile to the Faith.

If you are going to watch this series, at least seek some balance by reading ""The Rhine Flows into the Tiber"", or works by Michael Davies and Dietrich von Hildebrand who forcefully and intelligently argue ""the other side"".",1255910400,6,2075,5.416149068322981
