Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959), ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

2168847,4,B00065D1B4,"Small time Arizona rancher Pat Brennan played by an aging Randolph Scott has the misfortune of losing his horse in a wager over a bull, he had hoped to add to his stock. Hitching a ride in a stagecoach back home with a friend, along with a newly married couple Doretta and Willard Mims played by Maureen O'Sullivan and John Hubbard, they get ambushed by a gang of outlaws.

Richard Boone, a personal fave, is outstanding as Frank Usher, the leader of the 3 man gang that includes remorseless killer Chink played by Henry Silva.  When the cowardly Hubbard reveals that O'Sullivan is the daughter of a wealthy copper baron, Boone schemes to hold them for $50,000 ransom.

The wily Scott realizes that they won't survive after the gang shoots and kills Hubbard after his return from setting up the ransom drop with O'Sullivan's wealthy father.  He must convince O'Sullivan to help him try to escape from their predicament.

Filmed in the beautiful setting of Lone Pine, California this worthy flick, based on an Elmore Leonard story, pits Scott against Boone as two men who have mutual respect for each other but fall on opposing sides of the law.",1165449600,2,1144,4.728643216080402
2168848,5,B00065D1B4,"There are some great lines in this Western, as when good guy Randolph Scott says to bad guy Richard Boone, ""I'm not gonna take a shot in the belly just `cause you're feelin' sorry for yerself"". There better be a lot of good lines, because director Budd Boetticher's no-nonsense style and spartan values will turn any little flaw into one of those giant-sized boulders he so loved to film. This is movie-making at its neolithic, bare-bones best. Nothing gets in the way of the camera except dry desert, high drama, and shifty people.

Scott's got to figure out a way to save himself and plain-Jane Maureen O'Sullivan from the kill-happy henchmen of Boone's. As usual, Scott's a man-of-few-words, but means every one of them. That's why Boone likes him. He knows Scott's a man of honor and respects him for it, unlike the ""animals"" Boone runs with. This, of course, sets up the trademark tension of the Scott-Boetticher (Ranown) cycle of films, the clash between personality and character. We like Boone despite his evil deeds, but we respect Scott's code of honor even if he is short on personality.

All the Ranown films can fool you, including this one. The surface seems so simple, yet the people underneath prove surprisingly complex. The arrangement is sort of like a poker game where the camera fixes on the table as each player makes his bid. The trouble is each must sooner or later show his hand and we're never sure how it will play out. Too bad this kind of austere movie-making has become a relic of the past. Because in today's era of mega-budgets, hollow effects, and comic book characters, ""More has definitely become less"". And as these polished little gems prove, a whole lot less.",1153699200,21,1697,4.749152542372881
2168849,5,B00065D1B4,"This is one of the best of the remarkable series of westerns from the team of director Budd Boetticher and star/producer Randolph Scott.  It's basis is typically strong material from original author Elmore Leonard (""Get Shorty"") with a screenplay by Burt Kennedy, who would write several of the films in the series and go on to direct such films as ""Support You Local Sheriff"" and ""The Rounders.""  The film starts out light-heartedly then proceeds to set the western on its head by the savage killings of three extemely likeable characters.  For me, the element that really makes the film is the relationship between Scott and Richard Boone.  A western hero is only as good as the villain who opposes him and let it be said that Boone is an absolutely supurb villain, an intelligent guy with a sense of humor, an innate respect for Scott's character and a truly warped sense of values. There is even a scene in which Boone brings a tray of food to Maureen O'Sullivan and tenderly covers her sleeping body, even though he fully intends to kill both her and Scott once the ransom is delivered.  Richard Boone was a great actor and the scenes between him and Scott are to be savored by any western fan!",1126396800,22,1199,4.636792452830188
2168850,5,B00065D1B4,"The presence of Randolph Scott (Pat) and the masterful direction of Budd Boetticher guarantee you a fabulous and rewarding cinematographic experience. Rancher Pat loses his horse in a bet trying to buy a bull, and for these destine ironies he will be lifted by a friend in a stagecoach when the future dramatis personae will develop with dramatic intensity.

Greed, ambition, betray, double crossing, so characteristic of the low paths will face with the presence of a coward husband who tries to save his life establishing a plan with Frank (the leader of the bad guys) persuading him to make a ransom due his wife's family has enough money to pay it.

This story gradually will converge and expand in a true dramatic explosion of violent characters that will lead to a very cathartic ending.  Well acted with superb handle camera and a versatile script that will catch your immediate interest along the way.

A little classic, a cult movie and one of my twenty favorites in any age.

Watch to Randolph in another original Western five years later: Ride the high country.",1124755200,9,1072,4.836065573770492
2168851,5,B00065D1B4,"Like Ride Lonesome, The Tall T explores the shades of grey and black in villainy. However, Randolph Scott is very different in this film from his haunted, ruthless hero in Lonesome. Brennan, his character, is a man of optimism even in the worst of situations. This positive nature in the man creates a strong moral lesson: never believe in defeat, never be guided by negativism. Brennan is not a fool; he understands the peril he is in, but he is never panicked, never without hope.

The story begins light-hearted, and then unexpectedly turns bad with a fury. The ""bad guys"" are a trio that range from the opportunistic sociopath to the psychotic sadist. Richard Boone is the leader, but even he is disgusted with his partners. He tolerates them because they are a means to an end. A very young Henry Silva is the most evil, at least on the surface. Maureen O'Sullivan puts in a rare post-Jane appearance and is very effective as a past-her-prime lady-in-distress. Scott's developing relationship with her is an extraordinary definition of manhood as it should be. In times like these, we could all do with a reminder of Brennan's philosophy, ""It's going to be a good day!"" no matter what adversities we face. Mr. Scott is gone, but he still has a lot to teach that a man could learn from.

Five stars is no exaggeration for this tense, character driven movie. It makes a fantastic double-feature with Ride Lonesome, showing off the versatility of Randolph Scott in the hands of a director who understands the Western genre is something of greater proportions than a shoot-em-up horse opera. As I have said before, Mr. Scott rode Tall in the saddle in his day and deserves more attention. a Boxed set of Boetticher/Scott films would be an overdue delight.",1098316800,19,1756,4.7730263157894735

2168876,4,B00065D1B4,"*Spoilers*

Although not as good as Seven Men From Now (the best of the Ranown Cycle, imo), this Boetticher-Scott collaboration has a lot to recommend. Scott performs with his usual gentleman-like presence and likability; there are wonderful touches of him buying cherry candy for the boy and, after losing his horse to a bet, not being a sore loser about it. After the stationmaster, his son, and the stagecoach driver are brutally murdered and dumped in the well, you can feel Brennan's rage emanating from him.

The villains in this piece were frightening, especially Chink. I thought Frank (Richard Boone) was an interesting character. He's a variation of the bad/good man that one sees in several of the Ranown Cycle. He's depraved and brutal, but, at the same time, you feel like he could have chosen a better way.",1454025600,,820,4.892086330935252

2168892,4,B00065D1B4,I like this old westerns...grew up with them at the theatre.  Randolph Scott is the perennial good guy and Richard Boone is the very evil bad guy.

She is an old maid that married a local guy...of course her family was a big ranch owner....This movie ends quickly after all the bad guys are killed and the two heroines ride off into the sunset....holds your interest really well... evil bad guys...you would have to watch it see how evil they are....while never seeing who the bad guys kill at one point ...again they are EVIL....be hard to explain to a child watching the movie. 5 stars if for adults only.....I give it four stars.....not for children due to implications buy never seeing what happen when bad guys took over stagecoach rest stop......,1434240000,,798,4.782608695652174

2168911,5,B00065D1B4,"In the mid 1950s Director Budd Boetticher came together with ageing star Randolph Scott to make a remarkable group of B-Westerns. The first of these was SEVEN MEN FROM NOW  (1956) a Batjac (John Wayne) Production. This film was painstakingly restored and released as a Special Collectors Edition in 2005. The remainder were under the banner of RANOWN Productions, the name was made up from the names of Randolph Scott and producer Harry Joe Brown. Their second venture, also benefits from a marvellous script by Burt Kennedy from a short story ""The Captives"" by Elmore Leonard.

The opening sequence has our stoic hero Pat Brennan (Randolph) Scott in long-shot riding out of the mountains (SHANE like)  en route to a stagecoach way-station where much of the action takes place, starting with a stage hold-up by Frank Usher (Richard Boone) and his two side-kicks Chink (Henry Silva) and Billy Jack (Skip Homeier). Also caught up in hold-up are newlyweds Willard (John Hubbard) and Doretta Mims (Maureen O'Sullivan) who also happens to be the daughter of the richest man in the state. Willard is sent for ransom money whilst Doretta and Pat are held hostage. The tension mounts and Pat knows that times running out and that he must act soon and face down the gang one by one if they are to survive.

These Scott / Boetticher  Westerns have gained a cult following over the years and can be rightly regarded as mini-masterpieces!

2168920,5,B00065D1B4,"A review of the movie The Tall T. Unlike my other western reviews, this movie has no town involved. However it does depict three innocents that come under the absolute domination of a gang of three deperados.

 The hero is a Pat Brennan (Randolph Scott), a small, out of the way Arizona rancher. The heroine  (maybe there is a better name for her) is newly wed Doretta Mims (Maureen O'Sullivan). Her husband, Willard Mims, is the accountant at her fathers copper mine, and literally married her ""for her money.""

Brennan meets the newlyweds, as he flags down a stagecoach to give him a ride, after he lost his horse. Shortly after that a gang of three very ugly desperados, led by Frank Usher (Richard Boone), hijacks the stagecoach, and ""Chink"" the meanest of the desperados, kills the driver. Brennan later learns that they have also killed the stagecoach station agent and his son. He knows that to survive this ordeal he will have to, somehow, kill all three of the desperados. In turn Willard Mims also realizes he must do something to survive. And he is not above selling his new wife if it can earn him freedom. He lets Frank Usher know that his wife has a big ransom potential. A sum of $50,00 is mentioned. Willard Mims, along with Billy Jack, the third and very green desperado, ride to meet her father and the payoff is arranged. On return Willard Mims seeks to ride off, but he is shot in the back by ""Chink.""

 The next day Usher leaves to collect the ransom, and likely kills her father. Brennan needles ""Chink"" that he better follow him, to keep an eye on him, so he doesn't leave them in the dust. Now Brennan has to figure how to finesse Billy Jack. He convinces Doretta that she must use her sexuality, to distract this virgin. Brennan even undoes one of the buttons on her blouse. She pleads she can't do it. She is very shy, and has very low self worth, but Brennan is very persuasive. ""I'm not going to be shot in the belly because you feel sorry for your self. They're going to kill us, Mrs Mims."" She finally agrees and lures Billy Jack in, and while he is preoccupied, Brennan knocks him out and then kills him with his own gun. And it doesn't take long before Brennan gets the better of ""Chink"", who comes back after hearing the shot, and then Usher, who comes back a bit later.

 The movie ends with Brennan and widow Doretta walking off side by side. He talks with her and strives to get her to see the bright side of the situation. Although she has lost her husband and her wedding night and probably her father and seen more killings than enough, Brennan tells her: ""its going to be a good day!""

 This movie received many accolades including one customer review stated that ""this is one of the best of the remarkable series of westerns from the team of director Budd Boetticher and star/ producer Randolph Scott.""

 A second accolade from this review stated that: ""for me the element that realy makes the film is the relationship between Scott and Richard Boone. A western is only as good as the villain who opposes him and let it be said that Boone is an absolutely villain.""

The awards included a 2000 selection for preservation in the U. S. National Fil Registry by the Library of Congress as ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.""

The awards also included a HOLLYWOOD Movie Greats Feature.",1299974400,,3343,4.55

8038873,3,B00065D1B4,"Well if you are a Randolph Scott fan then you may like this movie. In my view Richard Boone carries the movie. He is always a presence in any film he participates in. The thing is, it's just not that good of a movie. The moral lessons are worn thin and the movie makers missed opportunities to create tension and keep the audience's interest.

For the time spent, I would recommend another Richard Boone western in which he co-starred with Paul Newman. The cast is splendid across the board, the story is compelling and unpredictable, and the score is haunting. The name of the film is HOMBRE. Be there or be square. ;>",1507507200,,619,4.477876106194691
8038874,4,B00065D1B4,"This is one of those Randolph Scott-Budd Boetticher westerns that stand as lean little classics. This isn't my favorite (that's Seven Men From Now) but it's very good.  As usual it's filmed gorgeously in the California desert around Lone Pine, and, as usual, there's a secondary character who's far more interesting than Scott, in this case Richard Boone's conflicted head bad guy, a man you believe wants to be good if only being good was a little easier and paid better.  One thing that bothers me: why did Budd insist on having everyone (notably Henry Silva) fire their Colts from the hip and still manage to knock down people a hundred yards away? Did anyone ever think that was a good idea? Also, from a 2000s perspective there's something a little creepy about Scott's interactions with the boy, but that's just times changing. But those are two small caveats in a tough, smart movie. Oh, it's based on a short story from the great Elmore Leonard.",1505606400,,953,4.734939759036145
