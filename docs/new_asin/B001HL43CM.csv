8565064,5,B001HL43CM,"Let's face it, most Australian movies are abysmal-but not this one.  You need to know that this movie has nothing to do with the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, but rather the tragedy of British nuclear bomb testing at outback Maralinga in Australia in the 1950's, and the subsequent fallout (literal not figurative) that caused terrible illness and death amongst nearby Aboriginal communities.  In no way is this a documentary, but rather a well paced, thrilling drama that deals with the cover up and eventual whistleblowing and investigation into the horror. Colin Friels and Jack Thompson are two terrific Aussie actors that feature in this brilliant and tragic drama.  I continue to annoy the crap out of my Aussie friends hoping that this great movie is one day released on DVD in ANY format, but until then I will continue to run my VHS copy over and over again.  I lived in Australia for a couple of years and enjoyed the culture and people and crave anything that reminds me of the place, and this movie is brilliant.  Must see!",1260835200,5,1054,4.737704918032787
