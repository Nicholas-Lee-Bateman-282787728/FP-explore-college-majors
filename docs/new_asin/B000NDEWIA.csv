8176870,5,B000NDEWIA,It really went over the steps slowly both for the men's and women's part.  The lesson showed the different angles of the moves and foot work along with important details for posture and foot position.  My partner and I liked it so much we ordered volume 2.,1453161600,,256,4.425531914893617

8176872,5,B000NDEWIA,"I recently started eating better and I am feeling great. So I decided it was time to add some exercise.

First, I needed something I can do in private. I quite smoking a few years back and I have the bum to prove it. So I am a bit self conscious about working out in public. I originally bought a dvd at the local book shop that was a standard work out video. After a few days, I lost interest. It was so boring. So I poked around on here and found a few different videos. I really like the idea of working out and learning to dance. I picked rumba because it seems very active and saucy.

As it turns out, my extra bum baggage ended up being really great for this. I giggle as I write this but it is very waist and hip focused and it really worked my core. I made me feel quite in tune with my body and it felt a bit silly and a bit sexy to do. I felt goofy at first but it ended up being really awesome. It is definitely challenging and it took me a bit to get the hang of it but I can feel it throughout my body. It was fun and interesting way to work out and the added bonus is that I will learn to dance.

I have a secret fantasy of showing up to a gathering with my friends and when the music starts I surprise them with me awesome moves. Right now though I'll stick to practicing. I'm sure I still look like Napoleon Dynamite but eventually I hope to make it to Latin Goddess. Hopefully I can convince the hubby to join me and we can pull an Addams family dance routine. Rawr!

8176873,4,B000NDEWIA,"Great educational video for learning Rumba. Slow steps which are fun to follow along with and get all the kids moving also. However at times, it's hard to follow when we turn and the tv is behind us. But it is fun and there is a lot of movement. So whether we were getting it all the first time or not, we had a lot of laughs and got a great workout.

8176874,5,B000NDEWIA,"This Rumba Dancing is very easy to follow. What's great about this 90-minute video is that you learn it at your own pace and it gives you the fundamental Rumba moves, in a step-by-step guide.

Plus...
* It's a lot of fun.
* Fantastic exercise.
* I feel less self-conscious practicing at home.

I would recommend this for anyone looking for a way to have fun while exercising. I received this product to try at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own. Would recommend!",1437436800,,530,4.627659574468085
8176875,5,B000NDEWIA,"I dislike the gym and am not all that fond of the typical work out DVD.  They just get boring and seem kind of pointless.  How often are you going to grapevine while lifting small hand weights?  That is one of the reasons I love the Learn to Dance Rumba DVD!  You can have a blast learning and perfecting a new dance while getting a decent cardio workout in.  I found the instructor easy to follow and even though some steps were harder, you could easily back track on the DVD.  I always feel awkward when I dance, especially when I need to wiggle and move my hips around.  I just feel too tall and  lanky and certainly don't feel like I am doing the moves in a ""sexy"" way like the dance was intended.  With this DVD, I am gaining confidence in the way and amount I need to move.  I can practice in the comfort of my own home and gain confidence without being self conscious out on the dance floor.
If you are looking for a great way to learn (or perfect) the rumba, this DVD is perfect for you.

8176876,1,B000NDEWIA,"Too few steps, foot work was too fast and when I made a turn my back wound up facing the screen.  Should have more rumba music to practice with",1408147200,,143,3.9310344827586206
8176877,5,B000NDEWIA,This is a very good DVD for learning Rumba dance. The instructions are clear (step-by-step and broken down for men and women's part). I could dance Rumba basically after learning from these two instructors. Highly recommended.,1285804800,3,226,5.305555555555555
8176878,5,B000NDEWIA,"I felt really good following the dancers in this video. I didn't realize how much ""hip action"" the rumba took. But, I like totally liked it. It was a little more complex than the other dances I have been learning, but I liked the easy pace of this video. Recommend! Recommend!",1209772800,4,276,4.431372549019608
