8465731,5,B005COLEYU,Was at the actual first showing of this documentary in Seattle. Wanted to have a copy. This was a chance of a lifetime. Trimpin is a fantastic artist and a wonderful person.,1384905600,,173,4.4375
8465732,5,B005COLEYU,"A nice documentary that traces the artist's work--both completed and in-progress.  A few brief tedious moments that drag on due to the film maker's attempt to create a ""mood"" but otherwise an entertaining and educational video.",1382918400,,227,5.305555555555555
8465733,4,B005COLEYU,"I'm using this book for my dissertation, I can understand why it'snot cheap, but it's worth it if you know what to expect from it. Don't buy it if you just want something to read in the bathroom, it's actually quite technical.",1334620800,,226,4.404761904761905
