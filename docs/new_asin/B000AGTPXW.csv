2388824,3,B000AGTPXW,"The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire was quite a disappointment considering that Sherlock Holmes adventures should be nothing less than AMAZING!
In this mystery, the master detective is investigating a series of murders involving an Anglican monastic order whose members are picked off one by one by what seems to be... a vampire.

The major setbacks lie in:
1) The poor choice of actor for the leading role of Sherlock Holmes in Matt Frewer; obnoxious, conceded, and overall not likeable, his was a poor performance indeed.
2) The lack of that sense of mystery that must accompany Sherlock Holmes at all times.

In short, it's a decent plot, a familiar setting, and a mediocre cast.
Though far from being a masterpiece, by no means is it a bad movie, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment.",1190592000,8,801,4.839416058394161

2388826,2,B000AGTPXW,"Canadian TV Muse Entertainment produced (and Hallmark Entertainment presented) four Sherlock Holmes made-for-TV films starring Matt Frewer as the world's most famous sleuth 2000 to 2002, and this is so far the last entry of the series. Unlike the three previous films - ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" ""The Sign of Four"" and ""The Royal Scandal,"" ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" is based on the original script written by Rodney Gibbons who also directed the film. (The film's title may remind you of Conan Doyle's original short ""The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire,"" but the Muse/Hallmark film has nothing to do with it.)

In ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" Sherlock Holmes (Frewer) investigates a series of murders which might have been done by a vampire. It begins with a death of an Anglican monk and fear quickly spreads in the church and the community. Some say the deaths are related to Desmodo, legendary vampire demon in British Guyana where some of the members of the church were sent, but Holmes is the last person who would believe in the existence of supernatural power.

First of all, I didn't find Matt Frewer's Holmes is as terrible as some people say. Surely he is prone to overact when he doesn't need to and we have seen more convincing Holmes in Jeremy Brett and Basil Rathbone, but perhaps we are asking too much, and Frewer's Holmes and Kenneth Welsh's Dr. Watson are not bad. Rather, I suspect that like other three Muse/Hallmark Holmes films, the film's weakness comes from something else.

That is the lack of mystery and mood. In spite of its part supernatural, part detective-story setting, the story of ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" isn't mysterious enough, not knowing how to draw the viewers into its fictional world. Actually the photography and production designs are okay, even effective at times, but they seldom create the atmosphere of the gas-lit city of London and its underworld. Plus the story is too slow; relations between some characters are confusing; and worst of all the clues (and red herrings) are not intriguing. You don't find any `speckled band' or `The Red Headed League,' proof of the genius of Conan Doyle as great storyteller. This film gives us a fair amount of clues in the course of 90 minute story, but few of them are really interesting.

Considering its low-budget origin,""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" is a so-so entry, perhaps marginally better than ""The Sign of Four"" of the same series (which changed its content substantially), but that doesn't amount to much.",1171929600,27,2553,4.916473317865429
8078439,1,B000AGTPXW,"The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire, 2002 film

A man leads a horse and carriage in a city street at night. A man prays in church, another walks behind him! Holmes reads an advertisement in the newspapers for a woman who can speak to the dead. A monk was murdered last week in Whitechapel Abbey. They have an unbelievable collection or idols. Do vampire bats spread rabies? There is a story about dead monks and a vampire at a mission. Holmes is called to investigate if a human is responsible. The housekeeper is afraid of Dr. Chagas. Holmes looks into the crypt to find bats and an open window. Holmes asks the monastics to remain inside at night. Brother Abel was frightened by a dark thing. Holmes wants an analysis of the blood from that lettering. Then he visits Dr. Chagas about his vampire bat studies. They talk. The neighbors are suspicious of Dr. Chagas as he only comes out at night. Holmes follows him at night but loses him!

Elsewhere Brother John investigates a noise and finds big trouble. The police are called. Inspector Jones suspects Dr. Chagas as he had a pair of bloody gloves! The Sister who was there remembers a smell. Holmes talks to that spiritualist. That night Holmes is pushed into the street! ]Didnt he hear anything?] Watson visits the Chapel at night and sees a figure leaving. Holmes questions Seora de la Rosa, and others. Some bats are in decline due to creosote in building lumber. Holmes talks to Dr. Chagas again, then Inspector Jones arrives. Later a hooded figure attacks a praying monk, there is a struggle, then a tremor! The police arrive, the mystery is solved. A most remarkable event. Dr. Chagas explains the bloody glove, Holmes explains why he suspected one person. Was it caused by a disease? A series of lessons? Will Sherlocks lost pipe be returned?

This film is based on the stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which is in the public domain, but it has not been authorized by any owner of any rights in the works of the author. You were warned. This was written and directed by Rodney Gibbons. This may be one of the worst Sherlock Holmes stories that Ive ever seen. Was there ever any monastery with both Brothers and Sisters? So what was the reason for this example? You can compare it to the classic Basil Rathbone movies of the 1940s.",1405036800,,2292,4.599022004889975
8078440,5,B000AGTPXW,"Matt Frewer is certainly a ""new"" Sherlock and my guess is that most people either love him or hate him.  He is certainly not Jeremy Britt, but I liked his approach to Holmes.  Kenneth Welsh is a perfect Watson to Frewer's Holmes.  Clearly no relation to the traditional Holmes tomes, this is probably the best of the  Not the traditional story, but still good.  I liked this story the most of the five ""new"" Holmes stories.",1389830400,,423,4.5131578947368425
8078441,5,B000AGTPXW,"I don't know how people can't praise matt for his acting as holmes, i personally thought he was great. The story was also very interesting, not the best holmes case but still a very good one",1381968000,,190,4.305555555555555
8078442,5,B000AGTPXW,this was Sherlock dealing with vampires.  Not my favorite theme but it was done very well and I enjoyed it,1356652800,,106,4.3
8078443,2,B000AGTPXW,"This is a horrible movie. yet i find another bad vampire movie. come on this is supossed to be a vampire movie, since when did sherlock holmes chase vampires or people dressed up as vampires. this is a murder mystery with a guy dressed as a vampire it should not even be concidered as a vampire movie. the only thing that kept me interrested in it was sherlock holmes the actor did a great job. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't",1349913600,,453,4.218390804597701
8078444,4,B000AGTPXW,"One of the best Sherlock Holmes TV movies ever made. Matt Frewer is a perfect Holmes. He has a Peter Cushing quality to his acting
in this role even though Cushing was the perfect Sherlock Holmes even better than Basil Rathbone who was great also. This movie is
a Holmes Horror Mystery much like the old Universal horror movies. The story is written, directed and acted very well by all. I like the
Vampire mystery added instead of the usual Jack the Ripper theme. As Frewer, Kenneth Welsh gives excellent performance as Watson.",1319932800,,528,4.688172043010753
8078445,3,B000AGTPXW,"What was frustrating for me is that there is already much better fodder than this with which one might have made a Holmes/Dracula (ala Vampire) connection - Saberhagen's Book ""The Holmes-Dracula File"" literally picks up at the end of Bram Stoker's Dracula and leads the reader and Holmes (& the erstwhile Dr. Watson) down some very amusing and ultimately satisfying trails. There is no non-supernatural denoument and it is believable. I wish this series would revisit this material and perhaps contract with Saberhagen to produce this story. Vamp & Dracul lovers alike would be thrilled!",1261008000,,587,5.189473684210526
8078446,5,B000AGTPXW,"You know, I gave Frewer a scathing review in his ""Hound of the Baskervilles.""  My main complaint being I did not picture homes as Max Headroom.  Nor did I want to see Holmes acting like Max.  But Frewer made a few Holmes movies and improved with each one.  This the acting here is fine and does not distract from the story. The script, however, is not the best.  The writer took liberties which make our Holmes here more human. I prefer the slightly more aloof and untouchable Holmes of  Jeremy Brett version.  But all in all this is a movie well worth viewing.",1255824000,,561,4.388349514563107
8078447,3,B000AGTPXW,This is probably not the greatest Holmes movie ever made. On the other hand I've seen a LOT worse. Just an entertaining story and competent acting.,1228176000,,147,4.6923076923076925
8078448,5,B000AGTPXW,"I am surprised at the hostility of several reviewers to these very interesting and atmospheric Sherlock Holmes' stories.  As fan of Conan Doyle's stories  in print and on film since childhood, I think Matt Frewer is by far the best screen emodiment of Holmes.  The arrogance, cynicism and touch of self-aggrandizement are just about perfect.  To say nothing of the physicality of Frewer's take on Holmes.  And of course that marvelolous voice with it's barely concealed snobbishly modulated inflection.

The Sherlock Holmes Collection (""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" ""The Sign of the Four,"" ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" and ""The Royal Scandal"") are not big budget productions, but they are effective and entertaining and the screenplay interpretations of these familiar public domain stories are fresh. However, it's Frewer who makes it worth every penny (or should I say farthing?).

My favorite is the creepy ""The Case of the White Chapel Vampire.""",1194566400,12,961,5.282894736842105
