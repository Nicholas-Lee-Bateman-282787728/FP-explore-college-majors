This one is interesting, but with all of her different outfits throughout the sequence, it was a little distracting. . .  I have to stress though, that I highly recommend her yoga mats; super thick and thoroughly friendly on the knees!",1314144000,,328,4.466666666666667
8132348,5,B000GI3KJO,"I had trouble finding this & barely knew she had this advanced ""fun challenge series"" dvd.

There are more reviews on her vhs version & this DVD suggest you master her 3 dvd beginner ""easy"" & 3 dvd intermediate ""hello fitness"" series first.

From other reviews on her other DVDs, you know she has a soothing voice with an accent that I didn't have trouble understanding, the views are gorgeous & she always tells you great info about body placement, even chinese medicine/martial arts/qi gong terms. She also tells you what organs or parts or systems of the body each pose works on as you do it to keep you going. Her soft speaking never intrudes your concentration. The music is light new age, mostly dominated by piano or string instruments.

The poses done are: wide arrow (balance on butt, legs spread), seated spinal twist (beginner level), supine side leg stretch (beginner), Dynamic  Combo Rolls (plow, roll up to boat, then down to seated straight leg fwd bend in one fluid motion *easier then sounds & invigorating*), camel (beginner), child's pose (beginner), toes/palm side stretch (holding weight on 1 hand & 1 foot with other arm reaching ceiling *need some arm strength*), patient crow (modified crow *modified handstand*), full split (1 leg fwd, 1 back, not Russian *just do your best, good stretch, use hands to hold weight up*), scorpion (handstand using wall), chin lock plow, shoulderstand (beginner), karnapidasana (shoulderstand w/knees into shoulder (adv.), double angle pose (standing fwd bend with arms held out (beginner), wheel (int.), 1 leg in air wheel (adv.), cross leg relaxation (beginner *resting pose*), bulldog stretch (standing legs wide & arms on ground stretching in front of legs & behind, beginner), half lotus stand (stand w/1 foot on inner groin same hand reaches around to grab toes & other hand reaches into sky *easy, just need balance*) & ends in her usual cute dance chant.

Reviwer's only complaint is too much makeup & colorful outfits. Some had trouble with her accent, but I who usually do, did not.

Her website is under her name wailana com",1176163200,4,2092,4.945868945868946
