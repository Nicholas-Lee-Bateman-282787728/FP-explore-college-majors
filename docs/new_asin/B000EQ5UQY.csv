8361751,4,B000EQ5UQY,"In my honest opinion... I would much rather have a lousy recording of a great show than have a great recording of a lousy show!  This is NOT a lousy recording!  A few songs are pretty weak sonically and have lots of high end hiss, however, on the whole this DVD is awesome, if you like guitarists that can send smoke signals through the wires to your speakers and make a room surge with rock 'n' roll energy!
The opening track ""Ghost Walking"" is really good and the quality is near excellent!  From there we get a bit of a mixed bag as far as overall quality goes, and it is a bit strange that they duplicated 3 songs with separate versions.  The band is hot and Bernie really shows his stuff here.  If you are aware of these issues ahead of time I think that most real Rock guitar fans will find this DVD very satisfying and worth cranking up very loud!
My copy doesn't say ""From the early days of Gillan"" which is good, since it isn't...Time wise maybe, band wise,  No.
5 stars for performance, 3 stars for overall quality equals a strong 4 overall!",1286150400,,1051,4.282828282828283
