4701539,1,B005HIBWPM,"Normally not a Western I'd watch but I picked it up at the local thift store for $1 on VHS so I couldn't pass it up. It's not a movie I would want to add to my DVD collection but it was an alright flick & I think I got my $$$'s worth. I wanted to like Greyeagle more then I did but for some reason I didn't. I don't know if it's because it wasn't the usual shoot em up Western I prefer or what. It felt more like something to watch just because I was in the mood for a Western. My favorite part of the movie was the final scene. In the end, Everything worked out the way I wanted it to",1432080000,,585,3.688

4701546,4,B005HIBWPM,"Released in 1977, ""Grayeagle"" is a Western about a man (Ben Johnson) whose daughter (Lana Wood) is kidnapped by a Cheyenne brave (Alex Cord). The man teams up with his Native partner (Iron Eyes Cody) and a friend (Jack Elam) to get his daughter back. Along the way they must tangle with a Shoshone hunting party, including a crazy brave named Scar (Jacob Daniels).

While the plot is reminiscent of 1956's ""The Searchers,"" it's different enough to not be a rip-off. ""Grayeagle"" is not a big-budget Western, like ""The Searchers,"" but I like it better. However, it's not a cheapie either and it genuinely surprised me for a number of reasons. For one, it's not a typical Western; it's just as much a Native American film as it is a cowboy Western; and the Natives are portrayed quite good, considering the time period. Secondly, everything about the film is totally over-the-top, like the acting, the (melo)drama and the blaring score. Speaking of the score, it plays like the bombastic music of the original Star Trek TV series, but updated to the mid-70s and fitted for a Western. It's quite good -- sometimes even moving -- albeit decidedly dated.

The plot similarities to ""The Searchers"" is interesting in that Lana Wood's sister, Natalie, played the kidnapped girl in that film. Speaking of Lana, she's just gorgeous. You might remember her as Bond girl Plenty O'Toole in 1971's ""Diamonds are Forever.""

Believe it or not, the annoying, half-crazy character Bugler was played by the director, Charles B. Pierce.

Shot in the Helena National Forest Northeast of Helena, Montana, the landscapes are picturesque.

FINAL WORD: ""Grayeagle"" is full of gusto and must be respected because the creators gave it their all to entertain the viewer; in fact, I include it on my hallowed ""Favorite Westerns"" list. However, the film is so overdone that it sometimes borders on ridiculous. So while it's often supremely entertaining the sacred words are fitting: ""Just because you like a movie doesn't mean it's good.""

The film runs 104 minutes.

GRADE: B",1418860800,3,2045,4.944606413994169
4701547,5,B005HIBWPM,"The film is clichd, but I find it hard to resist lines such as ""It is a good day to die"", spoken with so much righteousness.  Lana Wood's voice is like nails on a chalkboard.  Ben Johnson is perfect as always.  Jack Elam is over the top.  Iron Eyes Cody and Alex Cord make this film a guilty pleasure for me.  This is what popcorn was made for.",1417996800,,344,4.0

4701550,2,B005HIBWPM,"You've got to be kidding!  LOts of great reviews, but this is a campy 70's(and I grew up in the 70's) Western that really tries not to be campy, but it only makes it worse.  Wonderful outdoor shots and horsemanship but slammed with poor acting, script and, I think, the main culprit, poor directing.

First, I don't think of this as a remake of 'The Searchers' with John Wayne, now replaced by Ben Johnson's character, whose daughter, Lana Wood is taken by Grayeagle.  There is a search for the woman, but the reasons are different.  The director tries to portray Native Americans in a good light. The opening with the teepees is very surreal, beautiful and promising; however, the music kicks in(most of it typical 70's over the top stuff) and the actors, especially, Wood and Alex Cord(a super horseman along with Ben Johnson) show up and terribly overact.

It offers some very good, hardy actors in Johnson, Jack Elam(giving us, thankfully, humor with that squinty eye) and I like Iron Eyes Cody.  But I blame the director and the scriptwriter for not doing there jobs in making this into what could have been an amazing classic.  As it is, there are interesting parts and horrible, groaning parts.  Why they have Alex Cord talk in the low, droopy mouth, stilted speech is beyond me.  He's an handsome man and a super rider.  Lana Wood, sister of Natalie Wood. is beautiful but screechy, overly expressive and painfully misdirected.  She's more subdued near the end and more relaxed in her acting.

Of note, they use a  lot of different character types to portray Native Americans.  I like Iron Eyes Cody, but he's of Italian descent.  He married an American Indian, supported their causes, and, of course, did that famous ad, against spoiling our enviroment, with the teardrop.

Overall, they put a lot of effort in this movie with outdoor shots, horses, bizarre action scenes, but as a whole, I recommend, if you're going to watch this, turn off the sound.",1404259200,3,1961,4.754437869822485

4701552,4,B005HIBWPM,"I saw this Ben Johnson movie many years ago and had wanted a copy of the video for quite some time. Was excited to be able to have this in my collection. Unfortunately, I had to return the video. Not because it was defective, but because (as I discovered written in tiny print on the back of the DVD case) it will not play on a DVD player that also has recording capability. Amazon was very gracious in its communication and willingness to accept the DVD back and refund my money.",1401494400,2,480,4.285714285714286

4701555,5,B005HIBWPM,"SUSPENSE FROM BEGINNING TO END...... An Exciteing Film. Showing Mighty Cheyenne Indians, Magnificent Scenery.  And with a Beautiful Clear Wide Screen Picture for us as well.  Its Nonstop action all the way with this one.  An anxious father is searching frantically for his daughter, after she has been taken by an indian. IRON EYES CODY and a FRIEND are also helping him, in the search for her.  And there is something SO very terrifying, that they all  encounter out there in that wildness. You will also be meeting some Interesting, and unforgetable Characters, who make an appearance in this movie.  I highly recommend this film. Believe me, You won't be disappointed with this one.",1398556800,15,685,4.964912280701754

4701559,5,B005HIBWPM,This movie is a classic. Alex Cord was magnificent. All the actors were good. My heart was taken by Alex Cords talent. He was fun to listen to and watch his eyes spoke many things. The foreshadowing was very well painted. A deep romantic theme yet hidden. I have watched it so many times and still see deep meaning in the plot. I just wish I knew what the meaning of the customs for the Cheyenne were in the movie that were portrayed.,1391904000,,434,4.240963855421687

4701562,1,B005HIBWPM,What a waste of a reasonable plot...Iron Eyes and Ben Johnson could have been spectacular in this but the script was really poor and did not allow them to do good work.

When you have veteran actors like Iron Eyes Cody, Ben Johnson, and Jack Elam, how can a movie be less than great?

4701575,5,B005HIBWPM,"This movie is marvellous, Western with a difference. Plenty of action, Great acting by Ben Johnson and Jack Elam with support from the cast, The action goes from begining until the end. The river fight is a must to watch between two rivals of indians tribes. A man will do anything for his family and the trapper proved that, The indian has hes reasons for kidnapping the daughter, and it all comes to light near the end of the movie, No I'm not going to spoil it and say too much more. Watch or buy and relax and enjoy.
