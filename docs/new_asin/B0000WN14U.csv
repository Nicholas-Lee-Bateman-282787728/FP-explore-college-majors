1958119,1,B0000WN14U,"OMG it was SO disjointed and over the top ridiculous!!! e.g., one scene (the typical running away from bad guys, shoot-outs
galore, etc.,) Bandaras is up a flight of stairs, he puts his guitar case down and stands on it and surfs down the stairs
to hit a guy and lands right under him with a gun pointing
up at the guy's maracas...*rolling eyes* A#1 and first and foremost, a guitar case like that made for acoustic guitars would not support a child's weight, let alone a grown man and watching him stair-surf was just laugh out loud funny at a moment that was supposed to be serious...another scene a guy's guitar shoots flames out of the end of it then immediately after his friend puts his guitar case down,it sprouts wheels and he pulls out a remote control (like those little cars
at radio shack?) and it rolls under a jeep and he pushes a button and it blows it up...GODZ OKAY!!!
Johnny Depp is supp to have his eyes gouged out at one point and
the blood on his face is so perfectly painted it looks like THE CROW makeup or something, it also looks purple not red...the writing is just horrid beyond the realms of madness, I've never seen anyting so bad. They had like 8 plots going on at once, dream sequences that you didn't know if they were dreams or what was happening, if someone got shot they flew thru the air backwards about 100 feet in the air (this happened over and over and over and over ad nauseum...). Bandaras didn't seem righteously PO'd, etc., etc.,
Man, it was SO unbelievably bad...
There were also 2 characters that were were killed in Desperado
that showed back up (the bartender-Cheech Marin, and the really bad-ass guy w/blades, no explanation of how and why they rose from the dead..Wm DaFoe as a Mexican (if you can envision the blatant miscasting of that one), and Mickey Rourke as some guy we could never figure out who exactly he was supp to be or what
his purpose was really toting a little Chihuahua thru the entire movie...
SAVE...YOUR...MONEY...it gets one star for Rodriquez's amazing ability to take a small budget and film breathtaking action scenes--mostly by his own hard work and inovation and workaholic nature, but IMHO when the action scenes are more important than writing a plot that's not a convolted mess, wow okay, what a waste of time and money.",1079222400,2,2299,4.555555555555555
1958120,4,B0000WN14U,"Both of these movies are amazing, though I was all too happy that I was able to see El Mariachi before either of them.  The first movie was done almost entirely volunteer with a budget that barely covered the cost of the ammunition -- and yes, at that shockingly low price-tag -- it was that good that it rated two sequels!
Lots of southwest machismo flavor, guns, musicians, tragic love, what more could one want from a movie aiming for the top of the genre.
Desperado first disjointedly continues from El Mariachi (believe me, if you saw E.M. first, you would have at least a few confused moments when viewing Desperado the first time).  Once Upon a Time in Mexico picks up from where Desperado left off and the flash backs throughout the third movie do a reasonable job and tying the series together.  The plots for all three are fantastical and legend, but all three movies work the genre style for all they are worth and end up way way way on top.  Did I mention the astounding cast?  It's not just the stars -- they've pulled out some pretty legendary supporting actors to boot.
Five stars for the fact that in addition to being astoundingly fabulous movies -- each one of the three is able to stand as a solid movie unto itself without the other two.  Four stars for the set -- only because the set doesn't include El Mariachi, which I think everyone should watch at least a few times.  I think it is about time that El Mariachi garners due royalties along with its American companion sequels...",1077148800,4,1502,4.5
1958121,5,B0000WN14U,"This is not the type of film that will delve into your deep psyche and come up with something profound.
It's guns, action and more guns.
In my opinion Johnny Depp absolutely steals every single scene he is in.  He's got his character, Sands, down and you can tell he's really into his role.
Antonio Banderas is excellent at reprsing his role as el Mariachi and Salma Hayek is great eye candy and does faboulous stunt work!
Grab this DVD, kick back and enjoy the ride!",1076198400,4,467,4.430232558139535
1958122,4,B0000WN14U,"Why didn't they release this DVD with a Spanish audio track?  You can watch this great DVD in French and English but not in Spanish, even though most of the cast is probably Mexican.  The movie itself is great. The director is amazing.  What an omission.  The only reason I switched to DVD's is you can watch them in more than one language.",1076198400,,340,4.349206349206349
1958123,2,B0000WN14U,"This is supposed to be part of a trilogy, but it really is a barely connected duology.
I think you can forget about the first movie El Mariachi, interesting only if you figure that the movie cost only $7,500. Amazing really that it should have been a one star, based on cost. But the director created a relatively interesting film, that I would have given 3 stars to, but have to downgrade for violence and language to a 2 star.
At best it is a rental if one wishes to see what started it all for this director and what lead into the best of the three, movie, Desperado. Banderas and Hayek were not in the first movie, so I see little to connect it to the other two movies.
The second movie in the trilogy is Desperado starring Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek. Made in 1995, it seems to have grown in popularity over the years because of these two stars and the fact that this was a well funded and very well made movie. I liked Desperado enough to purchase it. This is not a family friendly movie. I give it 5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars because of lots of violence, bad language, nudity and simulated sex. But unlike Once Upon a Time in Mexico OUATIM, the banderas character is interesting to watch and rout for. Banderas is becoming one our better action stars not that he has turned in excellent performances in Zorro and the Thirteenth Warrior.
The third movie, Once Upon a Time in Mexico OUATIM, of the duology-trilogy is an uninspired, sometimes boring, excursion into senseless violence. I wanted Banderas to survive, couldn't have cared less about the smart-aleck Depp character and the story wasn't clear enough to try and follow. This is a 3 star movie rounded down to 2 stars for violence and language. There was no nudity.
Bottom line is that Desperado, the middle movie is a worthy addition to the collection for Banderas fans, the other two are not.",1076198400,2,1868,4.497058823529412
1958124,5,B0000WN14U,"THIS IS THE NEW 2 PACK RELEASED THIS PAST TUESDAY AND BROTHER, WHAT A RIDE! DESPERADO IS A KILLER OF A FLICK, BUT ONCE UPON A TIME.......JUST TAKES IT A FEW STEPS FURTHER! EVERYONE IS WONDERFUL, AS IS THE HIGH DEFINITION DIGITAL TRANSFER--BUT JOHNNY DEPP AS THE CORRUPT CIA AGENT SANDS, ONCE AGAIN, STEALS THE SHOW! HE IS INCREDIBLE RUTHLESS AND SO MUCH EVIL FUN!

1958125,5,B0000WN14U,"Robert Rodriguez is the reason why I make movies myself. A self made director, cinematographer, editor, and everything else, Robert proves that if you have a dream you can make it happen. Besides making great movies, the insight into how he makes those movies is worth the price of the DVD alone. He doesn't spend the whole directors commentary telling you the characters and storyline. If a director has to explain the whole story in the commentary, it makes me think that they are not sure that we as an audience got what they were trying to tell us. As for me, I want the director to tell me how they got certain shots or how certain special effects were created, and that is exactly what Robert Rodriguez does. He continues to teach me about movie magic! He makes me feel as though he wants me to learn his secrets and tricks, and as a filmmaker myself, I appreciate it. Other directors could take lessons from this great visual artist. Desperado, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids, The Faculty, are all great examples of Roberts directing and storytelling abilities. Buy the DVD's!",1072828800,3,1110,4.611111111111111

it was interesting, and I liked the story. When you put that cast together, you had me at the get go.",1345939200,,233,3.8541666666666665

8004183,5,B0000WN14U,"This film is a fun, silly, at a glance three and a half star film. However Johnny Depp, as a mad CIA agent, gets it up to five stars. He is very funny, stylish, suitably psychotic and by the end, though his character is pretty horrible, you feel sympathetic to him and want him to win. The person who wrote the one star review of the film should realise the blood on J Depps face is meant to be styalised. Depp also ad libs tons of great lines. Well done Mr D!",1093910400,,460,4.010869565217392
