8045227,5,B00076PAWA,"Separate Ways is not very well known but it is easily one of the best films ever made. It features great acting in the form of Karen Black, Tony Lo Bianco, and David Naughton. It also has a cameo for Sybil Danning. Filmmaker Howard Avedis's direction and screenplay for this film are top notch. Realism is the goal here and it shows. Dean Cundey of Halloween fame bestows this film with some of the most gorgeous cinematography ever devised. The music is captivating, enchanting, and makes you feel right at home. The story is timeless and regardless of what is right or wrong, the characters all act in a believable manner. Even bit parts are played with conviction. There are very flaws to be found here. This is a one of a kind picture that deserves much more exposure. Highly recommended.",1469318400,,792,4.624113475177305
8045228,2,B00076PAWA,"This is a Crown International Picture, which produced low budget films normally viewed at drive-ins. In this case this would have been the third feature after ""Switch-blade Sisters"" and something with ""Babysitter"" in the title. Val (Karen Black) and Ken (Tony Lo Bianco) are a married couple with one son (Noah Hathaway, the Neverending Story kid). He provides her with everything she could possibly want, but she feels unfulfilled. He drives race cars and is involved in some shady car dealings. She paints naked men.

When Val discovers her husband is having an affair, she has one for spite. They separate, hence the title ""Separate Ways"". Sybil Danning has a bit part as Mary, the girl who sells hot dogs. Val gets a job as a ""Foxy Lady"" cocktail waitress working for Jack Carter. The movie is rather lame and pointless, even in 1981. The script has less than B grade and it was sad to see some never actors a part of it.
