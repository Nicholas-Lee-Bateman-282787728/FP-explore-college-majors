8347330,5,B001W9SXTS,"This story is truly an example of the Christian spirit that began with one man, one encouraging woman, and one step at a time.  It reminds us that God seeks ordinary men and women to spred his message of love, encouragement and hope to all the people of the world amd how it is sorely needed. Inspiring,uplifting, it will certainly touch your heart and spirit. I suggest you view the special features section to see excerpts from the documentary. God bless Angus Buchan and family.
