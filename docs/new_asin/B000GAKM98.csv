8129961,3,B000GAKM98,"This is great material and a good price.  I was hoping to use this collection to replace the VHS recordings I made off the History Channel in the mid-1990's.  Unfortunately, this set ""only"" contains 8 episodes, and the series ""Civil War Journal"" had more than 40 episodes.  I'm wondering where the other episodes are and why I can't seem to find a complete set.  If you locate one (on DVD), let me know.

That being said, this set is nicely packaged and comes as advertised.  The price was right; I had just hoped that perhaps there would be some ""extra"" episodes buried in there somewhere.  Hopefully the other episodes will show up somewhere.",1346284800,10,644,4.646017699115045
8129962,5,B000GAKM98,Great DVD quality and convenience comes to a classic collection of Civil War videos hosted by Danny Glover.  Great introduction to major civil war battles done in a way the novice and advanced buff can appreciate.  Takes up a lot less storage space than the old vhs tapes too.,1303516800,5,276,4.612244897959184
