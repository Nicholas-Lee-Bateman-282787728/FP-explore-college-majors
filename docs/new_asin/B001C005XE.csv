3503362,3,B001C005XE,the fun thing about this movie is that I use to babysit for the producer and his brothers!  But it was well put together and informative.  The only thing is that there was some language that wasn't appropriate for young kids.  One of my friend's wanted to show it to her 5th grade class and couldn't because of the language--which was too bad because it was pretty educational and a good film for the kids to see just how hard it is to be a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Anyway--I would recommend this to anyone interested in the fishing industry in Alaska and a brief history of Ketchikan.,1215734400,,592,4.462962962962963

8285410,5,B001C005XE,"This was a great documentary...No way around it; I never cared for salmon, but I am going to find some Alaskan Salmon now, and I'm going to love it!  The reviewer who said they couldn't show it to school kids because of the 'language' really made me angry...this isn't 'the Deadliest Catch'!!  I think I heard one ' bad' (?) word at the beginning...I never heard another, and I was listening.  This is a movie kids really should see, about real food, and the real men who love their work, and nature...A great , and well made, and important documentary.  Thank you!",1461542400,,565,4.509803921568627

8285415,3,B001C005XE,"The movie made a very compelling description of the state of salmon fishing in Alaska, how the fishing industry was carefully managed so as the wild salmon industry can continue without over fishing and the salmons are healthy. The documentary compared the wild salmon fishing with the diseased farm raised salmons which are currently being sold worldwide at a cheap price consequently gaining popularity worldwide. The movie has succeeded in convincing me that I shall never again eat farm raised diseased salmon. Very informative movie.",1414368000,,538,5.341176470588235
8285416,5,B001C005XE,This is a wonderful film to see more of Alaska's beauty and her wonderful citizens. What an absolutely wonderful state to include in their constitution conservation measures. I'm not a tree hugging environmentalist but certainly enjoyed the fact that we are preserving this great state.,1397779200,,286,5.377777777777778
8285417,5,B001C005XE,I look at the packaging label on all seafood now. I will personally never eat anything farm raised again. I was surprised to learn that Wal-Mart does not sell anything but wild caught Salmon. Good for them.,1382400000,,206,4.594594594594595
