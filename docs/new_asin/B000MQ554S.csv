8170760,4,B000MQ554S,Suprisingly good quality picture & sound quality...... I am not a bit disappointed in this DVD at all... I would recommend this DVD for any mystery & old time murder enthusiast!,1404086400,,177,4.741935483870968
8170761,3,B000MQ554S,There are many movies in this set. some are stupid but there are some good ones in there also. the price is good so it is worth buying it.,1239840000,,138,3.793103448275862
8170762,4,B000MQ554S,"If you like old B grade movies of suspense and mystery I recommend this collection of a variety of this movie genre. Although not as spectacular with the graphics of today's action movies, the dialogue was good, sound was good, and fun to watch. This collection contained a number of detectives which I had never seen before like the mysterious Mr. Wong,  a movie with Ginger Rogers in which she did not dance but was very funny as a detective, and ""Lady of Burlesque"" with Barbara Stanwyck (what a doll), and Michael Shae. ""Lady of Burlesque"" was suspenful, funny, and its worth the price of the video by itself. Good buy.",1209340800,3,623,4.612612612612613
8170763,1,B000MQ554S,"The manufacturer of this DVD set clearly shows no qualms about ripping people off by including movies that are not complete.  Most notably is ""The Red House"" which cuts off abruptly after an hour leaving 40 minutes of the movie missing!  There's no excuse for this kind of rip-off especially if you're willing to put up with the poor quality of these transfers to begin with.  I Wouldn't recommend anyone buying this set, and shame on Amazon for continuing to sell a defective product now that they are aware of it!",1193529600,30,515,4.637362637362638
8170764,3,B000MQ554S,"I've only watched a couple of the films in this set so far. I was very disappointed when watching ""The Red House"", to find the film is incomplete. The last 40 minutes are simply not there. Very frustrating.

I don't know if other films in the set suffer from this problem but you've been warned. Its too bad because these are fun films that may never see a better release.",1178668800,30,372,4.314285714285714
8170765,3,B000MQ554S,"MYSTERY & MURDER - 25 KILLER CRIME CLASSICS features a nice sampling of most of the mid-20th Century's theatrical detective series. Dick Tracy, The Shadow, Mr. Moto, Ellery Queen, Sherlock Holmes, Nancy Drew and Bulldog Drummond are all here (while conspicuously absent are The Thin Man and Charlie Chan). There's also a nice cross-section of other 1930s and '40s who-dun-its that all fans of murder mysteries are certain to enjoy.
