8463931,2,B005BCE7GU,This Movie Is Just Bad!! It Was Wayyyyyy To Much Random Chit Chat..Also Very Predictable. Plus Don't Let Trailers Fool U Like They Did Me...The Clown On Trailer And Chick From Cover Aren't Even In It For More Than 10 mins lol would gave this 4/5 But Ill Explain My #Of Stars For It! The Film Itsself Was Ok So Give That 1 Star And Only Giving Another Star Cause Got Here Fast But No 3rd Or 4th Star out of Five Cause Its Case Was Broke...You Have Been Warned!,1457827200,,459,4.111111111111111
8463932,5,B005BCE7GU,"if you liked silent house and/or cloverfield with their non-cut storytelling, you really should get this and watch it several times...(i have)...it avoids the shaky hand-held cam and the scenes so dark you can't tell whats going on...while viewing, i actually felt i was inside that house with the characters at several times...i never hit the fast forward button either which is now a hallmark of a good horror movie...not iconic, but worth several watchings that makes it more than pay for itself...get it and be happy horror fans!",1346976000,,533,5.0
