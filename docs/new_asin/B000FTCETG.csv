2584372,3,B000FTCETG,"This remake of the original ""Maid in Hanaukyo"" is very different IMO.  Remade for appeal to a larger market many elements have been detuned such as fanservice, humor, music, and artwork.  Even image vividness is lacking on this remake version.  The original starts with a caution to turn up the lights in the viewing room while the remake has no caution nor is it needed.  Runtime of the original series is about 180 minutes, 12 15-minute episodes.  Remake is about 325 minutes, 12 25-minute episodes.  The original Hanaukyo video series was never licensed for region 1, US, I believe.

It's been perhaps years since I viewed the original series yet I found this ""La Verite"" version to be very different and rather boring.  It's like watching Love Hina when you wanted Mahoromatic.  I dug out my versions of Maid in Hanaukyo on DVD's for a virtual A-B comparison with La Verite, virtually everything is different.  Artwork of all the characters from video, box art, and pencil boards (6) are different from Maid in Hanaukyo.  It's like they got a totally different staff for the visuals.  Japanese voice talents sounded the same.

Various adventures of the Hanaukyo maid team consists of baseball and contests among the maid divisions, an earth quake that reveals forgotten underground quarters, Comic Manga Market, and invasion of the mansion by an entity that takes the unconscious head maid Meriel.  Master Taro finds that Meriel was specifically made for him and Taro leads the maid team for an epic battle to recover Meriel.  This latter part is more sci-fi like IMO and doesn't fit this series well.

A detuned Hanaukyo isn't really a bad thing but isn't really good either.  La Verite I obtained used from here, Amazon, box set consists of six pencils boards because the set volumes were originally bought separately.  Otherwise pencil boards would probably be three for the box set, I think.",1246665600,3,1899,4.899686520376176
2584373,5,B000FTCETG,"Are you look for good love story anime, this is it the best one, because it had all about love and Comedy. This contain Sexy thing like every maid is hot and most of charater is very sexy. Most sexy thing about the maids,is most maid had great body with sexy undie on them. Never mind the sexy part for you prevert out there. This is no hentai, but contain Nudity and sexual content.

The real story is base on manga Hanaukyo Maid Team La Verite created by Morishige. First thought to be hentai manga, but once you read it, you will know that it isn't hentai at all, is about a boy life after his mother die, then go to his grandfather manison with ton of beautiful maids who will do anything for him. His name is Taro Hanaukyo, and he is in love with one of the maid who is half way brainwash and created by lab.
You found out about it at the third disc, enough about go to the end don't want to spoil anyone. He also got a lot of problem with become the head of Hanaukyo, the problem like marry to other family, too much pressure, worry about every maids in the manison, and many more.

It a very funny love story with great value, high recommandtion for this complete box set, I know is short(12 episode), but is worth your money and time. the reason is short, because of lack of marketing of the manga which had more than 10 vol. sold in Japan, Mostly English version sold in U.S. is 3. Is very hard to find other vol. in JAp/Eng version in U.S. So Japan/U.S. decide to ship only 3 vol. Dvds in U.S. because there only 3 vol. manga in U.S. Love to see more, but this what got so buy it, before there not many left.",1185753600,,1618,4.117088607594937
2584374,5,B000FTCETG,"Hanaukyo Maid Team is a series about a boy, age never given though I'm guessing mid to late teens from his maturity if not stature, named Taro Hanaukyo who after the death of his mother finds himself the head of the Hanauhko family after his grandfather ups and leave. He is instantly taken to the families manision filled with beautiful but obessive maids wanting to serve him. Thus let the hillarity begin. You have to wonder sometimes though who exactly is the master, Taro or the maids.

Review time. Maid Team starts out with genuanlly Echii episode but it quickly simmers down, make no mistake there is still quiet a bit of nudity and sexual situations so you'll want to keep this one out of sight from the kiddies and from women if you want to keep living. However the slight perviness aside it's a rather light hearted and innocent story that's rather enjoyable story. The Characters are all likeable and have their own personality, some of which are rather unquic. The story line, is pretty basic with only one big turn that might take you by surprise. The animation is smooth and stream line. The humor that's makes up the series is though the basic gags go the next step of those gags making them as funny as they were when they were first used. The voice acting could have used some minor tweeks but nothing to serve or annoying. The Music is average anime fair, which means enjoyable enough to listen to. Prety much everything is about dead on though not exactly perffect, Id give it 4.5 if I could but can't sorry.

As for the flaws, there really aren't any beside it being to short to go into more detail on eah characters.

In the end Hanaukyo Maid Team is an enjoyable series just short of perfection and worth the buy.",1183161600,11,1736,4.522292993630574

While dressed and referred to nominally as maids, there are discrete albert sometimes unusual departments for most of the employees (including Defence, Science, Catering, etc.).
