8606726,5,B000HRMAW2,"Forget switch backside 180 hardflip crooked grind to fakie at one mile an hour. This is skateboarding as i like it. Cruising around fast, 180 no comply, half nap, ollie to nose wheely on a small curb. Friends cruising around together on busy streets. Some old faces (Ray Barbee!, Salman Agah, ea) and some newer faces. (pj ladd, p Rod) Don't expect really new hi tech tricks or big stair ollies to handrails. A kickflip down a five set by brian lotti or a hand plant by lance mountain is what you will get.
It is slow, mellow and you must like Beck, because his music is throughout the whole 40 minute film.
if you grew up on ""wheels of fire, public domain and questionable, you will like this video.

Get it, don't download it.",1205020800,,728,4.392592592592592
