7850954,4,6303544592,I saw this movie to see Colleen and Megan in a very different role from 'Anne of Green Gables'... well I was not dissapointed... lol  The story felt very real... it was sad and depressing... but liked the end.  The acting abilities of these two women sure impressed me though... especially Megan's performance in several scenes.  I gave this 4 stars only because the sound of the movie...it wasn't very good and sometimes I had to turn up the volume to catch what they were saying.  I loved the music playing at the beginning! :),1129680000,4,529,4.536842105263158
7850955,4,6303544592,"Like most people who came across this movie, I wanted to watch something that reunited Colleen Dewhurst and Megan Follows.  I had just finished the ""Anne"" trilogy and wanted more.  I was somewhat hesitant to watch this film because it was described as ""dark"" and I didn't want anything to taint my happy association with the Anne films.  And you can't get much further away from Anne than this movie...but I couldn't resist.  I watched it anyway, and am glad I did.  Yes, this movie is dark, and yes, this movie is really different from the Anne series, but rather than tainting my perceptions of the Anne films, Termini Station actually INCREASED my appreciation for the Anne films precisely because it was so different.  This movie is incredibly raw and real.  It was almost strange watching it because of the actreses' strong association with each other and the Anne series but, more than anything, this simply increased my level of respect for Dewhurst and Follows, who demonstrate their versatility as actresses.  I very much enjoyed this film and would recommend it to any Dewhurst or Follows fan.  Actually, strike that.  I'd recommend this to *ANYONE* looking for a great drama.  This film is that good.",1022544000,16,1211,4.8585365853658535
7850956,5,6303544592,"I purchased this video to see Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst together again. It's the complete opposite of the Anne films; dark and extremely depressing. Dewhurst is an alcoholic, Follows, her prostitute daughter. It is very interesting to see how Dewhurst and Follows play off each other in a dark drama. These two actresses have unbelievable chemistry.  It's a shame they could not make more films together. If you like blockbuster American films, this isn't for you. There is no extreme profanity or cars and buildings to blow up.  It is a simple, but intelligent adult-themed film that is definitely worth seeing.  Also, if you like opera, there is an interesting country style version of Turandot in the opening credits that is actually quite nice to listen to. Although the film is good the first time around, it definietly deserves multiple viewings.  The more I watch it, the more interesting it becomes. The film is definitely a plus in my book.",993945600,33,958,4.931677018633541
7850957,4,6303544592,"If you are looking for a slick, no holds bared movie, this isn't it. This movie is classic acting all the way. I bought this movie to see Megan Follows in a less than nice part as she had done in the Anne of Green Gables movies and I was not disapointed. This is a grim film to be sure but it is also a film to savor because it is smart and has depth. The characters may have been sterotypical but the underlining reasons they were that way makes this film juicy and something to chew on. Colleen Dewhurst plays the part of the mother with perfection. I wish Hollywood would make more of these kind of movies. Small focus with a lot of depth to explore. It is Rated R but that is due to the language and some of the subject matter. The video does suffer from uneven sound quality probably due to the use of natural sound without overdubing they use on most movies these days. That and the natural lighting just adds to the  depiction of real life.",973123200,13,947,4.174863387978142
7850958,3,6303544592,"I bought this movie off amazon.com because i couldn't find it anywhere else.  I grew into quite a Megan Fellows fan after her stint as Anne of Green Gables.  She is an enchanting actress with an incredible gift.  She  deserves an oscar just for having such depth to go from portraying anne to  Micheline, who is the total opposite of anne.  She is amazing! Colleen  Dewhurst was also brilliant in this movie.  AS for the movie itself, it  wouldn't be worth the $$ i spent, if megan weren't in it.  it was a  depressing story and had no real spark to help it's viewers want to keep  watching it.  It's worth it just to see Megan and Colleen...  kudos to you  both!",930268800,19,663,4.319672131147541
