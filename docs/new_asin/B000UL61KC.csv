8213615,4,B000UL61KC,"The concept of ST. CLAIR's FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION film set is solid: nine movies that were nominated for ""Best Picture,"" ""Best Actor"" or ""Best Actress"" Oscars. Additionally, the directors involved read like a ""Who's Who"" list: Otto Preminger, Vittorio De Sica, Michael Curtiz, George Stevens, etc.

For those new to public domain movie collecting, these high-quality vintage films will be an excellent addition to your DVD library, and for the established collector as well, this is a convenient gathering of some of the finest movies ever made.

HIGHLIGHTS:

TWO WOMEN-- Sophia Loren in an uncharacteristically unglamorous role, as a woman who flees the WWII Allied bombing of Rome with her daughter, only to have the war follow her to a remote village.

A FAREWELL TO ARMS-- This early Gary Cooper talkie deals with the adult subjects of non-marital sex and pregnancy. From the Ernest Hemingway WWI novel. Includes some excellent trench warfare reenactments.

THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM-- A superb performance by Frank Sinatra in the story of an abstaining heroin-addict and card dealer desperately trying to change his life.

THE FRONT PAGE-- This earliest screen adaptation of the stageplay suffers from poor sound quality, yet is still the best version of that story. Look for Clark Gable and Herman J. Mankiewicz (he wrote ""Citizen Kane"") in uncredited minor roles.
