3960518,1,B002NXSRFW,This has to be the worst thing ever made for tv. Who ever thought this woman should have her own show is crazy. Also shows the awards given for children's tv is just as stupid. My daughter watches baby first tv but I change the channel or ten the volume off she. That show comes on.,1365465600,5,282,4.053571428571429

8375558,5,B002NXSRFW,"An excellent video for older infants and younger toddlers. I call it baby valium because our baby finds it soooo soothing. Sweet songs, some educational content, and best of all our kid loves it.",1435104000,,195,4.764705882352941
8375559,3,B002NXSRFW,Love her and the concept. My son loves the puppets and the music.  He enjoyed the video clip of her live concert that was offered on her website better than the DVDs.  I gave it only three stars because the quality of the DVD was poor ---- the voices are not in sync with the mouth movements and the picture quality is grainy.  Looks like it was homemade.,1434153600,,355,4.1911764705882355

8375562,5,B002NXSRFW,"When first watching Sukey's Circle Volume 3 DVD I noticed it has a 1970's vibe that I adore! All the content throughout the videos are handmade and you can there is a childlike imagination to how it was created.  This makes it easy for young children to understand and absorb.  Most children's shows today have lost a certain magic they used to have because they are over stimulating to the senses.  Sukeys Circle contains incredible songs, animations and puppets.  It is everything a children's show should be.
I am impressed with Sukey Molloy's camera presence.  She is very playful and has a voice that can suck you into her world within seconds.  As an adult viewer I was taken back in time to my childhood years and I couldn't help but smile and giggle watching her.  My favorite video is ""Twinkle Little Star"" a about a curious little star and his great grandfather star.
I definitely recommend anyone with kids go out and buy this DVD.  Sukey Molloy truly understands how to stimulate the minds of little boys and girls. Go out and get it!",1377475200,3,1046,4.616216216216216
8375563,5,B002NXSRFW,"My children always loved Sukey's classes, and this DVD is a great way to enjoy her wonderful, thoughtful style at home, in a tempo that's nice and gentle for little ones to follow along with her. In her classes and at home, Tick Tock is by far the favorite! We definitely recommend this and Sukey's other DVDs for lovely music and movement at home that's presented in a more child-friendly way than some of the frenetic, busy shows out there that can overwhelm a 2-3 year old.",1376784000,,476,4.482758620689655
8375564,5,B002NXSRFW,My two children (ages 2 and 4) both love this DVD.  Sukey is a warm and friendly presence and her engaging manner and whimsical songs will have your children singing right along with her.  It's so nice to find a show that they both can watch/enjoy.  I recommend this to anyone with small children.,1376784000,,297,4.462962962962963
8375565,5,B002NXSRFW,"My three boys are mesmerized by Sukey's DVDs.  They have helped them integrate movement, music and learning in a fun and engaging way.  It is so refreshing to find quality children's programming that is beautiful, thoughtful and educational!",1376697600,,241,5.315789473684211
8375566,5,B002NXSRFW,"i have all of the sukey circle DVDs and my 2 little girls love to watch them. Sukey is fun, and has a way to get the children involved while they are watching at home.
