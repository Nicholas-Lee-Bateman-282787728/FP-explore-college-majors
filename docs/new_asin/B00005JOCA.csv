1596772,5,B00005JOCA,"I was lucky enough to see this when it first came on tv.  A perfect way to enjoy the Halloween season, with it's true to life storyline that was able to scare the ""dickens"" out of thousands of people across the united states in 1938.  My mother told me about how her mother had ""tuned in"" to this radio broadcast and was so convinced that she took the kids into the basement and prayed.  I belive the movie not only showes us the way it was produced on radio but how the listeners around the country reacted to what they ""felt"" was an really happening.  The studio really needs to put this out on dvd and allow everyone of this time period to see the impact that radio had on our grandparents.",1128038400,4,693,4.2272727272727275
1596773,5,B00005JOCA,"Have not been able to find this movie even on video in recent years though would still be waiting for the region 4 version.  However once things are released in the US they usually end up released in Australia eventually.

You would have thought this movie would have reappeared with all the interest in the War of the Worlds recent release as when it was on TV so long ago it was a fascinating movie about the famous radio broadcast.",1124582400,2,434,4.4125
1596774,5,B00005JOCA,I wish I could see this film again.  It has been over 25 years since I saw it on TV in England. It swept me along in a way many 'big' movies fail to do.  I've rarely watched anything so absorbing. Since then I've looked out for it but without luck.  Pity it won't be available to the UK DVD region - I'd buy it!!!,1124064000,3,313,3.7846153846153845

1596869,5,B00005JOCA,"The 1975 made-for-television movie, which originally aired on ABC, is a faithful reproduction of Orson Welles' famous 1938 CBS Radio broadcast of The Mercury Theater On The Air production of H.G. Wells' ""The War Of The Worlds."" The movie also documents the hours leading up to the historic broadcast, the nationwide panic during the broadcast, as many listeners believed the Martian invasion was real, and its aftermath. Paul Shenar does an excellent job portraying Welles, and the star-studded cast includes Tom Bosley, John Ritter, Eileen Brennan, Meredith Baxter, Will Geer, Cliff De Young, Michael Constantine, announcers Casey Kasem and Art Hannes (THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW), and many others.

He didn't know what was going on till he got home. Paul shenar is spot on as orson welles. His voice has a commanding prescence. Oh, and by the way there is a water tower in grovers mill.

1596920,4,B00005JOCA,"This is an old favorite. I checked the Imdb site and found that this TV-movie premiered on October 31st, 1975. Halloween.
This was 37 years after the event.

Since the movie was made for television (and pre-widescreen), it's shown in the older 1.33 format.
When I first began watching it, I was frankly disappointed with the video quality. It's not very good; about like a 2nd generation VHS tape.
There is a noticeable softness in detail and colors are slightly off. Hence, four stars.
Well, it IS an old print. Luckily, once you get into the plot you forget all about the video quality.

I don't recall any bonus material and I think it's just the movie itself. It's strange to realize that the events of 1938 are closer
to the broadcast of the movie than we are today.",1459382400,,771,4.539568345323741

1596969,5,B00005JOCA,"Saw this on TV many years ago. Recorded it on VHS but lost the tape. Saw it on the website and I had to have it.  Not sorry, it is as good as I it was when I saw it on TV.  Watching the movie puts you back in time when the radio was your entertainment and also gives you a little history lesson.  Quality and sound was very good.  It was a great buy.",1438646400,,350,3.6266666666666665
1596970,5,B00005JOCA,"I saw this back when it first aired on TV. I used to work in radio, and knew the story well. At one station where I worked, we even played the original Mercury Theatre of the Air broadcast, on vinyl in those days. We did more disclaimers than Orson Wells did originally. :-) A few weeks ago I was telling my roommate about this, and decided to look and see if there was a DVD of the TV movie, and here it was! I was so happy to be able to see this again. My favorite part is the pickle jar in the toilet. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. As a commercial producer back in the old days, I used tricks like that all the time.",1437782400,2,630,3.853846153846154
1596971,5,B00005JOCA,"Extremely good 1975 made-for-tv film.  Sort of a dramatization of what happened in 1939 when Orson Welles and his radio performers played their vamped up version of H.G. Wells War of the Worlds.  Apparently a lot of people tuned in AFTER the program started, and with the way it was played, was taken to be a real invasion that was really happening.  The costumes and period look looks very realistic.  The performances are excellent, especially the radio performers and particularly Paul Shenar as Orson Welles.  Shelley Morrison as a sound technician is perfection and Casey Kasem is great as one of the radio performers.  I can't say enough good things about this film.  Very highly recommended.",1434153600,,698,4.9655172413793105

1596974,5,B00005JOCA,Amazon...  by a knockout !!!  I just compared Amazon's version with Earthstation's;  Amazon's picture is MUCH better... the studio scenes... VERY BRIGHT. The night scenes outside: VERY DISTINGUISHABLE... [ you can actually SEE what's happening.] I have both copies and compared them back to back. The difference is night and day. The ONLY downside is that there are NO CHAPTERS. Some dirt specks [ nothing annoying ] and some grain [so what...] Picture is AMAZING !!!  Worth an up-grade ?

1596995,5,B00005JOCA,"I saw this when it was originally presented on TV and enjoyed it then, as well as now.  The blurriness as well as the sound may well be because of the actual quality that was available then and so it is not HD quality as many expect things now.  The company  that produced this makes many rare videos and it could be very costly to redo them.
The show describes the panic that happened in some places, as well as the radio production that went on in the studio during the broadcast and that makes it more interesting and entertaining.",1420761600,3,534,4.32

1596997,2,B00005JOCA,What I do not like is the fact that I cannot watch it. I do believe I will have to return it. There is no point in keeping it if I am unable to watch it. This was a very good movie though and it has taken a long time for me to find it. What a disappointment.,1418688000,,258,3.4655172413793105
1596998,4,B00005JOCA,"Very informative.  As it is 40 years old, the sound is a bit unbalanced.  Sound effects often drown out the narrative.  It seems a bit fuzzy in picture, too, but that could be because I am projecting this from a computer for my students.  All in all, I like it and the students are finding it very interesting.",1417392000,,310,4.293103448275862

1597000,4,B00005JOCA,"We really enjoyed The Night That Panicked America!
It was great fun to see how the sound effects on the old radio shows were made.
Some movies done in ""real time"" can be slow-but this moved right along and was great fun.
Would have be five stars, but the old film was a tiny bit blurry. After adjusting the projector, it was much better.
Totally worth a view!! Lots of fun. Some people may not realize, this is a true story.",1416787200,,424,4.246913580246914

1597002,5,B00005JOCA,I remember seeing this film 1 time only as a family and I tried to put myself in the mindset of those desperate Americans and poor Orson who fought not to be interrupted and have the surprise given away. I thought it was unique and shocking and unbelievable how so many folks chose to take their childrens and own lives before they found out it was a spook story for enjoyment by a very gifted writer and many talented actors. Absolutely wonderful depiction of how it all must have been.  I'm finally getting my own copy.,1409788800,,521,4.427083333333333

1597055,5,B00005JOCA,"This TV movie: The Night That Panicked America(1975) is a great film on the fears, in 1930's America, of pre-WW 2 fears. It even show's the actual shotgun shooting of the famous water tower incident(thought Martian Tripod's),in Grover's Mill,NJ. I loved it,especially,because I was an extra in it then!!! I have the entire movie on VHS.I am sure many of you would love a copy of it again some time. Hope it is released soon!!!",1394150400,,426,4.693333333333333
1597056,4,B00005JOCA,"I saw this years ago, and have watched for it to reappear on TV, esp. around the original Mercury Theatre broadcast anniversary at Halloween, but to no avail.

The scenes depicting Welles & his cast performing the radio broadcast are especially amusing.  I wanted a copy of the show because of those scenes most of all.

Having waiting fairly patiently for Amazon to acquire this again, the sand in my hourglass ran out today.  I don't know the Amazon policy, but suspect they won't appreciate my posting other sellers on their site, so--hint hint--it doesn't look like they are ever going to offer it again, but it is for sale online.

OK, I'll just include the link, and Amazon can delete some or all of this, if they like.  This is one source:

I was 21, and my first impression was visceral, as I was totally drawn up in not only the story of War of the Worlds, but also the drama taking place behind the scenes, both in the studio and across the nation.  This is a well-crafted movie that has stuck with me ever since, popping up in my mind year after year, and always wishing I could see it again.  Here it is, 2008, and once more, this movie is on my mind!  I would like to share it with my family, as it gives a small but important historical glimpse at the mind-set and vulnerability of our country when it was broadcast.  Not to mention also very entertaining.  I'll buy three when it comes out!",1200787200,10,730,4.178571428571429
1597061,5,B00005JOCA,"This movie engulfed me. The pace is superior, and your feeling for the characters is warm and very human.  From the beginning, those on the radio had no idea of the panic they were creating outside and across America.

You see the effect of the broadcast of H. G. Well's ""War of the Worlds"" on the wealthy, the poor, farmers, and those barely making ends meet.  You see them react the same way as they scurry about, desperate to save themselves from the bloodthirsty Marsians.

There are so many levels of humanity shown in this film, that I wish they would release it on DVD or at least on VHS again. I loved it!",1159228800,8,613,4.350877192982456
1597062,5,B00005JOCA,"This film is one that I could watch over and over. It took the radio version of Orson Welles ""War of the Worlds"" and brought it to life. The panic that Vic Morrow showed when he was in the tunnel with his wife and child, uncertain as to what was going on but knowing that he had to save his family by ending thier lives!! What a rush!!!! I video taped it when it was on television years ago, and I no longer have a VCR. I have been looking for the DVD for years.

Wells' book ""War of the Worlds"" was relocated to the USA, Dexter Mills, New Jersey to be exact. The location was chosen by a dart throw! The movie goes into details of how the sound effects were produced. Astounding and surprising! The actor who played the radio news announcer had listeners on the edge of their seats with his realistic emotions. So realistic, in fact, that the interruption of news bulletins is no longer allowed in any type of broadcast to this day! I bought a cassette tape of the original radio broadcast. I can see how this could have started the panic that it did. Especially since, back then, there were no commercials during the show. The people who tuned in late didn't know it was a show! The people in the studio had no idea what a stir they were causing! I believe you will be as impressed with this film as I am.

 Invasion radio broadcast.  Paul Shenar is fabulous as Orson Welles and the atmosphere of the movie I would think successfully recreates live radio broadcasts of the time.  Vic Morrow and John Ritter are excellent in supporting roles.  Although the side stories to the broadcast may be a bit too-""soap-opera-ish"", it is not all that great a leap to believe that things like that actually resulted from the radio broadcast.

It was very well written, directed and acted.
The movie's storyline was very well balanced -- equally portraying those who were involved in the production of radio broadcast, as well as the general public, who were unaware of the program's original intent.
There were tidbits of humor to balance out the story's normally sobering and bleak tone.
