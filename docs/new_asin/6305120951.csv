7883131,2,6305120951,"This film features Doron Madmony as a primary teacher, and actor Geoffery Lewis as a sidekick. This arrangement reminds me of TV infomercials, where a third-class TV actor is used for promoting an outrageously priced product that does not even work (this was not a comment on Geoffery Lewis' acting ability). There are two possible reasons why they have used an actor, and not another shooting instructor in the film. The first is that Madmony is not ""famous enough"", therefore the need for a celebrity. The second explanation is that Madmony does not speak very goog english, and they have needed someone to narrate the film.
And speaking of the film, there is way too little content. Although the total length of the film is just over 30 minutes, there is only perhaps 20 minutes of material. The rest is used for history of the Amam (Israeli SWAT), and the shooting style in general (both are somewhat interesting, but I would have preferred that this would have used for teaching techniques). And there are long, unnecessary video sequences between chapters. These sequences are always the same, during the whole length of the film.
In the film, first they teach the safety rules (there are more than just the four most common safety rules, and some of the extra ones are quite reasonable). Next they handle shooting grip, pointing method (not point shooting!), standing position, two-handed grip, and firing the gun. As you can see, there is no instruction on different shooting positions, reloading, clearing malfunctions, shooting in low light, and so on; not even drawing the gun! And there is not a word about tactics, either.
At the end of the film, Madmony regrets that there would have been so much more to teach (I'll say!), but it did not fit into this tape. Well, it would have fitted, if all the unnecessary stuff would have been removed, and the total length of the film would be more reasonable 60-90 minutes. But then, if they told it all in one tape, then they could not make any new films...
This is not entirely bad film, but it is badly lacking in many respects. The only reason I gave this film two stars (and not only one) was the price.
