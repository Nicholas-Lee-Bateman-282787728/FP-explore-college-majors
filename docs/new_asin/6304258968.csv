7865858,5,6304258968,"His voice, his words, and the content.  Neil is a master of writing music that everyone can enjoy and in this VHS each tune is as rich and full of catchy music as all of his other concerts.  Being in Tenneesee and working with the other artists and putting on a party for all of us to enjoy is an Experience.  He shows much happiness and proud of his work.  As all his other music it stays in your head for weeks at a time.  His music and pronounciation of the words to the music is awesome.  He is the only person who is able to sing his songs the way they should be sung.  I beleive ""Under Under A Tennesse Moon"" is one of his best.  Most Enjoyable.",1050537600,3,651,3.992248062015504
7865859,5,6304258968,"I am not a fan of country music and groaned when I thought my hero was selling out to sing in Nashville...
Well, I was wrong. What is not to like about this video. The duet between Neil and Waylon Jennings is so poignant, especially when you realize that it was inspired for Waylon's love for his wife.
And you get a peek into Neil creating and letting his hair down, literally... It's great to see him so relaxed and easy in the rehearsal section.
But the highlight was the song ""Everybody,"" that he does with his son Jessie. The music is haunting and it is just lovely to see father and son sharing a moment.
The rest is a great tribute to country that young and old will like.",1029110400,8,679,4.230769230769231
