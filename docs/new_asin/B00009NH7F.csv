7994470,5,B00009NH7F,"[the set] comes with the four DVDs, a set of still-frame cards, and two of the soundtracks.
As for the series, I can mostly say - if you liked Serial Experiments: Lain, or if you enjoyed the more theoretical and metaphysical aspects to Evangelion, you may very well enjoy Boogiepop Phantom.
It is hard to go into the plot line without actually giving away much, but the story mostly deals with a set of homocides that happened five years before the ""present"" time in most of the show, and with ""special children"", and of course Boogiepop, who is a suprise in herself.
The anime may leave some people disappointed, if they found that the questions still left unanswered by the series really bothered them in such shows like Lain, but if you are up for a very dark show that has stints of philosophy, exsistential concepts, and an odd and somewhat disturbing storyline, I would suggest picking this up.",1069286400,6,900,4.666666666666667
7994471,5,B00009NH7F,"I picked this up at Best buy in Omaha, and I think it was the only one there.  Very good packaging--comes with a three-disc soundtrack, a set of long cards, two excellant pencil boards, and the entire four disc series in individual packaging.",1060300800,8,242,4.627906976744186
