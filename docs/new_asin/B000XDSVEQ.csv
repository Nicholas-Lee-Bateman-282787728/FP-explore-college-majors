8545341,3,B000XDSVEQ,"I am a therapist and I ordered this DVD to help some of my couples with their sexual issues.  I think this DVD would be helpful for performance issues as well as technique.  Unfortunately, my DVD (which was supposedly new) was scratched and I had a lot of problems watching it.",1292803200,,277,4.411764705882353
8545342,5,B000XDSVEQ,"My husband and I have been married for almost 5 years (in February) and things in the bedroom were getting a little boring, so we decided to get some self-help videos to spice things up a bit.  This was one of the videos we got.

We both liked it a lot - it went through a short lesson on bodies and anatomy, and we both thought we knew all of that stuff but we did learn from it!  Then it went step by step through the exercises.  There were a couple of different therapists, and one of them talked a little bit about each exercise and then the couples did them on screen.  Those parts was pretty sexy, but very tasteful - I felt very comfortable watching it with my husband.  There were two couples, one who had obviously been together a really long time, and one who seemed more like newlyweds.  The older couple was very inspiring for us personally - they just seemed so tender and affectionate.  There were also some extras that had questions and answers and more information on the exercises, and that was pretty interesting.

We watched it straight through the first time just to see where it was going, and then we did the exercises.  It was kind of funny at first to keep switching it on to make sure we were doing the exercises right, but it did help keep us on track.  We'll probably try it again without the video and see how it goes.  We've recommended it to a couple of friends of ours and I think they will like it too.",1196640000,20,1434,4.250922509225092
