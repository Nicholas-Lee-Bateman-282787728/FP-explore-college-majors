8401712,5,B003OT6I4Q,"This recording was panned for bad sound in its DVD release by a very fine Amazon customer reviewer, but the piano sounds full and natural to me. I checked a few professional reviews as well, including Gramophone, Fanfare, BBC Music, and Tutti Magazine (France), and if they mentioned the sound at all it was in positive ways. They were also positive about the performance, though in humorously opposed ways. Some loved the Bach, some thought it the weak point. One finds Kovacevich visually dull, unexpressive; another interesting, thoroughly involved emotionally. And so on.

The program:

Bach: Partita No. 4 in D major, BWV 828

Schumann: Kinderszenen (Scenes of Childhood), Op. 15

Beethoven: 33 Variations in C major on a Waltz by Diabelli, Op. 120, ""Diabelli Variations""

--: Bagatelle in G major, Op. 126, No. 5

I enjoy the entire program. Bach isn't repertoire Kovacevich is known for, but he clearly enjoys it. He makes it sound natural on piano, beautiful, thoughtful, vigorous, with a nice balance of left and right hands. Some of the Schumann is fast but tenderly articulated, other parts are fittingly dreamy or longing but never too ponderous. The Beethoven is powerful, well propelled, flies off the keys, reflective when called for. The bagatelle is a lovely ""good night."" Kovacevich pushes his limits in this playing, especially the Beethoven, and there are a few smudges, but overall it's remarkably precise.

The video quality is good, with natural color, dominated by deep blacks, the pianist's white hair a striking contrast especially when backlit. There's a mix of focuses on the hands and/or face, with occasional shots with the entire piano. Both hands and face are expressive without exaggeration.",1420329600,,1724,5.135714285714286

Stephen Kovacevich is a pianist whose playing I've admired for many years. His style of playing is characterized by muscularity, precision, fire, thoughtfulness. But in this DVD of a live recital at last year's (2009) Verbier Festival in Switzerland, the sound is echoey, clangy, tinny and whatever Kovacevich may be doing with the music is diminished enough that it becomes unpleasant to listen to. I wondered if my ears were playing tricks on me so I asked someone else to listen, too, and their comment was 'is there something wrong with the sound?'. It sounded that way on another machine as well. I suspect the problem may be the venue, a church in the Alpine resort town of Verbier, which must have been a difficult recording site.

The performances are of pieces that Kovacevich has made audio recordings of and so unless one simply wants to SEE Kovacevich play -- and the video is expert and unobtrusive -- I'd suggest those earlier recordings be sought out. In truth, in fact, this live performance, even allowing for the sound, has its share of problems with dropped notes, rushed tempi, blurring pedal.

Alas, I cannot recommend this DVD.
