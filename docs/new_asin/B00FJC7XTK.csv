5993506,4,B00FJC7XTK,"This is a copy for computer only apparently.  I have two Samsung DVD players, Blu-Ray but different vintage, capable of playing all ""old"" as well as newer DVD's.  I ordered a second DVD for this title and Neither of them will load or play on either of my TV's.
I am return both for my money back.  Am NOT happy as I really wanted a good copy of this video to share with family and friends to play on larger TV screen, not computer.",1386633600,,431,4.107142857142857

8616032,5,B00FJC7XTK,"I ordered 2 DVD's neither would work on 3 different DVD players that I tried to run it on. I returned them and reordered, the new ones they wouldn't work either I got out my old computer that has a DVD player (new one doesn't have one) It works fine on the computer. I have been in contact with Jonny Lewis who produced this film apparently the format of this version (something I didn't notice in the description)is not used in the US. The US version should be available very soon check back for the NTSC format.
The film is a fascinating story of a young girls integrity in the face of some  very difficult trials
Makes you wonder about the Nazi's who when questioned at the Nuremberg trials excused themselves saying ""we were only following orders"" when they did horrific things to their fellow human beings",1390262400,3,810,4.510204081632653
8616033,5,B00FJC7XTK,"Wow..... what that little girl had gone through because of being of a religious view that opposed the Nazi's. I've heard stories from Jews who survived the camps, that spoke of the Jehovah Witnesses & how strong the faith of those people were & how the Nazi's couldn't break them. I wish this dvd was longer, I would love to know more of what made them so strong, since I know that a lot of Jews who survived blamed God and believed that he was the one responsible.
 The story on this dvd is told from the viewpoint of a little girl, now grown, who was taken from her parents & put in a Nazi school where they tried to break her & make her into a Nazi, but couldn't do it, because of her strong moral beliefs. There is also a 50 min interview with a holocaust historian included on this dvd. It was amazing to find out that the Jehovah Witnesses don't go to war. I know that the first century Christians wouldn't go to war & I had thought that original type of Christianity was long lost. I had hated Christianity. Good to know that there's a Christian religion out there who truly practice what they preach, ""love your neighbour has yourself""",1388448000,9,1143,4.316279069767442
8616034,5,B00FJC7XTK,"A gripping film and one everyone who appreciates ""life"" should see.  This documentary is one of the best I've seen exposing Hitler and his Nazis political fervor against humanity.  An accurate telling of those who first actually exposed and petitioned against his tyrannical course because of their very real faith in their God, his Son and what the Bible teaches.

As of this writing however, this DVD is not yet available in the NTSB format commonly used in America.  Presently only available in the European format of PAL.  The producers say the American DVD format is forthcoming.",1386720000,4,584,4.979381443298969
