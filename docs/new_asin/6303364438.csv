632935,1,6303364438,"Being a history buff, a fan of the ""Spartacus"" series recommended this ""Caligula"" as a faithful recounting of the actual cruelty & wanton behavior of ancient Rome.  The ad description for this movie specified ""all regions"".  However, the DVD I received was ""region 2"" only~!  It would not play on either of my late-model DVD players----as America is only ""Region 1"".  The seller did offer to replace the DVD, but it is a big hassle for me to pack it up and ship it back on an $8+ item.  Since this was an American order from an American company, they should have insured the region designation was as-advertised.",1502409600,4,612,4.62962962962963

632988,5,6303364438,"Absolutely superb Blu-ray print.  BE ADVISED--This is NOT ""I Claudius"" or anything close to it.  Don't treat it as a real movie.  Do not buy this if you are a Helen Mirren fan.  However, if you are a male of a certain age (45-60) and can remember the thrill of finding a copy of ""Playboy"" or ""Penthouse"" magazine in your neighbors garbage can, and longed to see the girls in the photos actually doing it, boy, is this movie for you!  The ONLY reason to buy this movie is for the orgy scene, which features actual Penthouse Pets from the 1970's frolicking about in a cocaine fueled debauch I'm certain they all came to regret as the years went by.  Admittedly, the action is relatively tame by today's perverted, internet-age standards, but back in 1979 girls in high end men's magazines simply didn't do that stuff.  I've bought every version of this film since it came out (VHS, DVD) and this Blu-ray had material even I've never seen before (behind the scenes stuff, including new material from the aforementioned orgy, as well as the two ""making of"" documentaries included in the ""Imperial Edition"" DVD I bought a couple of years ago).  If the names Anekka Di Lorenzo, Jane Hargrave, Bonnie Dee Wilson, and Lori Wagner mean anything to you, you simply MUST have this.  Ignore the stupid picture on the cover--its reverse side has the traditional blue cover art.  Its not some crappy knock-off---it's the real deal.",1496275200,6,1417,4.700404858299595

632994,2,6303364438,"I thought the movie was going to be more history related and instead is a raw porn movie, not exactly what I wanted. Wish I could return it, will never watch it again. There was a better program on tv closer to history but I missed it and it comes rarely, not all the sex and sex in this movie, kind of disappointing. There were so many details that never came out related to Caligula's history, the movie is not good at all. Won't recommended it to anybody. If I wanted to watch porn, I would've just done Pay per view. Not worth the money or anything.",1491436800,,553,4.177570093457944

633066,2,6303364438,"Two stars and that was being generous.  Truthfully, I bought this cause Helen Mirren was in it.  I've seen Helen in 2010 The Year We Make Contact and liked her work.  This movie is soft porn at best, at worst a waste of celluloid.  Malcolm McDowell provides his usual level of psychotic acting laced with zany, extreme bouts of controlled lunacy.  This is one of those movies I've heard about for years and always wondered what it's really about, sad to say now I know.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody.  The nudity wasn't all that great although I should say Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla did have a great body but her carrying on with her supposed brother Caligula (McDowell's character) makes you feel like you're watching something you shouldn't.  Sad to say also Teresa passed away in January of this year.  You see some brief nudity with Helen Mirren as well but not enough to justify the price of this set...  Peter O'Toole (perfect name for this style movie eh...) put in a good performance as Tiberius but he did good in every role he's done.  Every movie has their cult fan clubs and I'm sure this one does as well but I would say unless you're a HUGE  fan of Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole or Helen Mirren and I mean a huge fan not a tiny maybe fan I would pass on this.  I'm sure the Caligula cult fan club would love to bury me up to my neck and run the automated head chopping gizmo over me.",1488412800,4,1416,4.358778625954199

There seemed to be a slight possibility that the film had some mild graininess on the screen but mostly it was of high resolution.  This show featured a very bizarre story and depicted weird sexuality.  It demonstrated the cruel aspect of Caligula and his quick decisions with no one daring to challenge his authority.  This movie may or may not be reflective of actual historical facts.  I don't know, but it's a free country.",1483660800,3,530,4.717391304347826

R-rated Version is a good movie and Unrated Version, is way over broad on the added porn, no wonder it was Unrated, but as R-rated movie it's fair watching, nothing to write home about.  Malcolm McDowell as Caligula works good to a point. I again would say, play it safe and see R-rated Version.",1480982400,,438,4.407407407407407

Shocking the first time yes but it was there to make a point. In a country that is the largest consumer of porn one would think people would be more opened minded. But then again America is a country that glorifies violence but turns it's nose up and nudity and sex. Thank the religious zealots for that. The same debauchery that took place in the ancient empire still takes place in the present day American/Western European empires.  Political parties still slit each others throats for power( more figuratively now). We still give convicts the death penalty because we fear them. People still commit incest, rapes go under reported as well as people having sex with animals is under reported. Malcolm McDowell is perfect casting for Caligua.

633467,3,6303364438,"Caligula is fortified with schmeckels and schmaginas, overacting and underacting, elaborate costumes and disposable costumes, too much Khachaturian and too little Prokoviev. Some view it as porn, while others view it as a masterpiece. In otherwords, this film is not for Roman history buffs, unless a rare Roman history buff prefers his movies flavored with Babylonian extravagance. It's the kind of vivid entertainment that zaps your eyes and caresses you below the belt. It can turn the viewer on and/or disturb him. It's not so shocking as it was back then, but now those excessive ""shocking"" scenes tend to bore or provoke some mind wanderings. Most viewers won't care whether this production is historically accurate, because there are enough stunning scenes and dramatic intrigue to keep it interesting.

As for the actors involved, John Gielgud gives a solid performance with jaded stoicism while Peter O'Toole portrays his character with campy pride and decadence. Helen Mirren makes a very cold and dull supporting character while Malcolm McDowell gives an explosive and charismatic performance as Caligula. There isn't a director out there who could be more proud of his leading actor. If it wasn't for Malcolm McDowell and the dazzling sets and costumes, this film would be little more than an ornate c*ckfest.",1466553600,,1321,5.260663507109005

Today its just another weird sex film. For me its a one time watcher. If you want a clean version of Caligula.

Malcolm McDowell, A Clockwork Orange, plays Caligula and actual does a great job portraying the psychotic Emperor. That saves it from the 1 star. I have seen many things in my life, but I actually had to turn this off halfway through and take a break. This is the king of pointless nudity. Believe me, not the good kind like Helen Mirren is topless in her prime which does occur, but just retched imagery for the sole purpose of repulsing and it does quite a good job.  There are plenty of up close shots of the ""bush"" of yesteryear on the women to which I am not a fan, and even a scene wear a man gets ""fisted"", involuntarily I might add, on his wedding day. Oh, of course after Caligula rapes his wife. This is all in the first hour. I cannot think of a situation in life where viewing this film would be appropriate aside from a dark room with the shades drawn and a hooded sweatshirt to go ahead an turn the creep factor to 1000.

633550,5,6303364438,"Originally intended by its director to be a sarcastic film on the orgy of power in ancient Rome, Caligula became instead an explicitly pornographic film about the power of orgy in the hands of its producer, Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine. Brass was banished from the edit suite by Guccione during post-production and Guccione edited the film himself, putting scenes in the wrong order and inserting hardcore porn sequences starring Penthouse Pets which he had shot himself.

Unfortunately, in the uncut version, McDowells performance is somewhat wasted and feels secondary to all of the onscreen sex and it is for this reason that one wishes Brass were allowed to complete the film himself.

If you want to watch a good (if sexually and violently explicit) film then I would recommend the alternative version of Caligula. The uncut version is not a particularly entertaining film  I, for one, found it very difficult to watch.",1461542400,10,941,5.097402597402597

633820,5,6303364438,"Im normally a person who prefers to watch feel good, happy and peppy type of movies, but something compelled me to check out the movie Caligula to expand beyond my own biases and how I perceive the world in order to take my creativity to another level (especially for my scriptwriting and authorship goals).  The film Caligula opens with the following quote; What Shall it Profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul (listed to be from Mark 8:36). The film Caligula then shows  the film to be listed as a Bob Guccione and Penthouse Films International Presents Caligula. Anyhow the movie Caligula stars Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, Helen Mirren as Caligulas wife Caesonia,Teresa Ann Savoy as Caligulas sister Drusilla, Peter O Toole as Caligulas granduncle Tiberius, and John Gielgud as Tiberiuss political advisor and friend Nerva. One of the strong plot points of the movie Caligula is that it is shown why others view Caligula the way they do because of the way he treats even the men who were most loyal to him.  Caligulas wife Caesonia and his sister Drusilla are probably only among a few of the people that Caligula shows some humanity towards.  This is important because the movie features a scene where Caligulas sister Drusilla did not want Caligula to marry Caesonia because she was considered not attractive in the conventional sense, too old, and too extravagant (a spendthrift). The movie actually shows the character of Drusilla hoping to dissuade her brother Caligula from entering into a romantic liaison and/or possible long-term partnership with Caesonia by also explaining how promiscuous Caesonia is (but that only draws Caligula towards Caesonia even more).",1446163200,2,1701,5.0212765957446805

The acting was superb, the background scenes were more than a little interesting, but the focus should be on the reign of Caligula, or the reign of any monarchy. History does show those in power are always disposed of by those seeking the power, so in that aspect the story is the same and will remain the same even though civilization makes the same desires of current humanity take a much subtler form.",1429056000,,638,4.8090909090909095

634882,4,6303364438,"I got to say considering this is a copy of a VHS tape that is over 25 years old, it was in rather impressive condition and the quality ironically was better than the 20th anniversary DVDs. I bought the 20th anniversary edition of the r-rated version Caligula and it was very faded and the colors were not so restored as it made it sound on the cover.  anyways I have read that the 10th anniversary addition of this film several copies just like mine you can see the top of the negative and the film at times seems to go back like they're trying to go a little bit into a panoramic view but at that time the film just seems cockeyed, like instead of the film going into widescreen for some shots it looks like they recorded it playing in the theater you'd have to see it to understand what I mean. however that was just the distributors wave panning back a larger shots of this set, and it doesn't affect the audio or video meaning color or sound.

I'm a huge fan of Helen Mirren, granted this is not her her best film but it's a great way can see where she started along with Malcolm McDowell. astounded by the fact how many huge actors are in this film. Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud,  Teresa Ann Savoy and John Steiner are just to name a few.",1410307200,4,1274,4.278008298755187

Utilizing pornography in a ground-breaking and controversial way in portraying ancient Rome replete with an actual Roman orgy just before Caligulas brutal murder, Guccione pushes the envelope in a provocative way worthy of Mars and Venus.  Malcolm McDowells portrayal of Caligula captures the stark madness of the depraved Roman leader through sophistry and sophisticated subtleness.  The XXX-rated film is a masterpiece of pornographic production, cinematographic construction, as well as bloodthirsty and bloodcurdling affectations of acting.",1403827200,,961,5.899280575539568

Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, and Peter O'Toole are all splendid in their roles.  On a personal note, when I was 18 years old, a friend recommended I see this film.  That was in the mid 1990s, when video stores still abounded and there was no way to buy ""banned"" films, and X-rated films were only available for viewing in few-and-far-between intervals.  So, it was almost 20 years before I saw it for the first time.  I knew of the orgies and so forth, and was expecting them to be quite a bit more gory than they actually were.  There's only one scene that I'd call ""really disgusting"" - and it's one of the hetero-sex scenes - and since I am gay, I suppose it's appropriate that I'd think so...some of the hetero scenes were nicely done, although they needed more homosex scenes for sure.  I read Ebert's review for it back in the 90s and it made me want to see the film even more.  My friend, a literary scholar, said ""the film has exactly what Ebert says it doesn't have, particularly with the eroticism.""  So, it's all in the perception.  One man's garbage is always another man's gold.  Too bad so many people call this film ""miles and miles of trashy footage.""",1398729600,11,1327,4.506276150627615

Also, the sex is staged and not particularly interesting - almost a parody - and the brutality is just stupid.  I would give it ZERO stars if possible.  Only redeeming feature is that it really does have some stars in it playing very strange characters - I have no idea how/why.

Defintely do not recommend it to anyone.  It simply does not work as a story of Rome nor even as good porn.  It doesnt even work as a farce or parody of itself.  Waste of time.",1398297600,,626,4.318965517241379

Two, Malcolm McDowell. I mean come on after that performance in A Clockwork Orange, I knew he would be a fantastic Caligula. And did play the insanity nicely but I wish there was more history in the movie. They got all the names right though.

635405,5,6303364438,"CALIGULA
filmed over a 2 year period back in the late 70's and released in cinemas in 1979
originally this film was going to be a straight forward sexual Erotic Drama about the Roman empire,
actually about the Era of Rome when CALIGULA reigned power
the original concept was written by Gore Vidal and Directed by Tinto Brass whose known for Erotic Dramas
and in between the writer and Director is Producer Bob Guccione who was somehow part of Penthouse magazine
Bob also Financed the whole film

During filming nearly all scenes were played out straight from the script by Gore Vidal
this is mentioned in Tinto brass's interview on the extras
so the film does have a plot which included some Erotic sex scenes (but soft core sex)
also included alot of Nudity, very Graphic killing and violence, lots of blood spurting in some scenes
 which was very controversial back in 1979
During filming Producer Bob Guccione and Director Tinto brass had alot of Arguments
cause Bob wanted some more sex scenes in the film but Tinto didn't want it
so During editing, Bob Guccione went behind Tinto Brass's back and filmed some more
very explicit sex scenes between 2 penthouse models and other extras that were in the film
the explicit sex scenes are equivelent to today's contemporary porn
so you see everything in this film, even the Orgy scene is full on
anyway these extra scenes were inserted back into Tinto brass's film before it was released to cinemas
so you can imagine, there was lots of controversy, scandal and Lawsuits between
Bob Guccione, Tinto Brass and Gore Vidal when this film was released to the public

so there is 2 versions of this film the Unrated X rated cut of the film
that has explicit sex scenes included, about 1 hour of extra sex and violence etc
all the extra scenes that Bob Guccione Directed screwed up the film, screwed up the plot actually
so the Unrated version does not make sense with the plot of the film
cause the extra scenes are just for show
the Unrated version goes for about 2 hrs 40mins
The 2nd version is the Alternate cut of the film
it's the version that has all of Bob Guccione's extra scenes cut out of the film
so the Alt version is Tinto brass's Theatrical cut i'm assuming

cause i've never seen Tinto brass's Theatrical cut i've only seen the Unrated X rated version
i prefer the X rated version, it's about opinion, a person's perspective on the film
so you either like it, love it, or hate it that's it.
back in 1979 films like Caligula were Unheard of
especially when you got scenes of explicit sex in a General public film
you've got the X rated or Tinto brass's Theatrical cut of the film, so you choose which version to watch

Both versions of Caligula are on this IMPERIAL EDITION blu-ray release
Disc 1 has both versions and both versions have been given beautiful HD widescreen transfers
in all new remixed 5.1 master audio surround sound
Disc 1 also has has new Audio commentaries by Malcolm McDowall and Helen mirren
about there experience with making the film

lots and lots of special features on Disc 2
there is 2 making of Documentaries about CALIGULA, Vintage making of footage actually from 1977-78
the first one is the uncut 2 hours of behind the scenes footage and interviews
the 2nd is a featurette of the same Doco but shorter
so take your pick
there is also brand new interviews with Tinto brass about 1 hour conversation
about the making of the film, He talks about the lawsuits with Bob Guccione
his relationship with writer Gore vidal, he talks about actors Malcolm McDowall, Helen mirren
fantastic interview
there's a new 30mins interview with one of the Penthouse models from the film, Lori wagner
she talks about how she got involved in the film and her Lesbian sex scene filmed by Bob Guccione etc
there's also an interview with one of the Actors in the film John steiner
there's lots and lots of behind the scenes Photos
and the list Goes on
for some reason Malcolm McDowall & Helen Mirren didn't want to do an interview for this blu-ray
but instead they've done the Audio commentary
there is Vintage interviews of Malcolm & Helen from the Making of Doco anyway

for fans of this film definitely get this blu-ray version, Definitely worth the cash

635436,4,6303364438,"If your interest in this film is titillation, you will be sorely disappointed and possibly even ashamed and confused.  For the most part, anyway (I admit that a scene or two gets my blood pumping).  If, on the other hand, your interest is in seeing one of the strangest, most excessive major motion pictures in history, then you've hit the jackpot with this movie, buddy.  Right from the start, the viewer is assaulted with gratuitous genital shots, inexplicable ballet music, and fragmented editing.  The scene that opens the movie was supposed to be much later in the film, and the scene that was supposed to be first was moved to 26 minutes into the film, making for a very obvious continuity anomaly.  But to complain about these kinds of things in Caligula would be a futile endeavor, because continuity mishaps are the soup of the day here.  That and close-ups of genitalia.

The fascinating story of how this movie evolved and changed hands from its seed to final form is too long to go into here, but if you look up a website entitled ""200 Degrees of Failure"", you'll find a painstakingly detailed analysis of just about everything known about the situation.  I highly recommend reading it either before or after watching the film, as it does a fantastic job making sense of the madness displayed in the film.

Needless to say, the film had so many people vying for control of it, each making their own changes to suit their whims, that what's left is something that NONE of them wanted.  It really is a mess, but it's a colossal mess.  It's a fascinating mess.  It's the grandest mess in film history.  The sets, the costumes, the set-pieces.. all so bizarre they defy belief.  And watching Peter O'Toole swagger around with syphilitic sores on his face, shouting and drunkenly leering at anyone who happens to meet his gaze, while the unspeakable madness right out of a Hieronymus Bosch nightmare plays out behind him... it's not an experience easily explained.  It really has to be seen to be believed.

As for the story itself, it's not hard to follow.  Tiberius is killed, Caligula becomes emperor, and he instantly becomes a monster, delighting always in the misery of everyone around him.  End of story.  The acting is excellent pretty much all around.  I don't think there's a bad performance here, although the editors did their best to convince you otherwise.  The sets and costumes are lavish and nightmarishly detailed.  Although they're not quite historically accurate, they do serve well the tone of the film as we now have it, with its vision of Rome as a literal Hell on Earth and Caesar its Satan.  Even the unsimulated sex scenes, filmed and inserted after-the-fact to almost everyone's dismay, help to fuel this hellish, hallucinatory tone.  It's all so relentlessly blunt in its execution, that I can't help but admit its effectiveness.  The problem, of course, is that this effect was not quite the one that anyone intended at any stage of the production's history.  It is effective, nonetheless.

The film does start to drag in spots, due certainly to the poor editing.  The director, Tinto Brass, having been fired from the film just before the editing began, the numerous editors brought in to cut the film didn't know what to make of it, and more or less assmbled the pieces at random.  Other editors then came in and did further work to make the butchered film more coherent.  And on and on this process went for quite some time until what we were left with is a monstrosity that, in the right editor's hands might have been a masterpiece.

As it is now, it's just a fascinating failure.

Also recommended: Fellini Satyricon - a similarly bizarre and grandiose take on ancient Rome, but much more artfully done, and a film that actually IS a masterpiece.",1388966400,,3788,4.7534456355283305

635493,4,6303364438,"I would posit that the reason that directors Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione's 1979 bloated epic CALIGULA is so controversial is that the story behind the production of this film is so incredibly dysfunctional that it makes the story in the film seem somewhat tame in comparison. And there's also the hardcore sex that makes it pretty controversial too. What's also so controversial about CALIGULA is not necessarily how apparently poorly it represents the accuracy of the historical characters within, but more about what a terrible, awful, gloriously bad film this is.

The film is the depths of badness from beginning to end, and it's somewhat astonishing that so many talented performers were involved, but it's likely that they were attached before the film was co-opted by Penthouse Magazine's EIC Guccione, who demanded that hardcore sex scenes were added so that the film could get the financing it needed. EVERYONE in this film gives the worst performance of their careers, with one exception. From Malcolm McDowell as the titular Gaius Caligula to Helen Mirren as Caesonia, the mother of his child and wife to Peter O'Toole as the syphillis-maddened Emperor Tiberius to Teresa Ann Savoy playing Caligula's sister/lover Drusilla; they're all awful. The only actor that turns in anything approximating a good performance is Sir John Gielgud as Senator Nerva, but thanks to his early suicide, he gets to leave pretty early on.

Everything looks like it's shot using sets from a decently-budgeted community theatre troupe. And there are moments that just make you shake your head in disbelief, whether it was real or not. The giant beheading machine; the various scenes of masturbation devices; the scene where a guard is killed by wine... It just looks terrible, sounds terrible, and IS terrible.

But in all of this madness, this film almost begins to revel in and embrace this terribleness. As the hardcore sex scenes start to emerge, all of which were shot by Guccione and featuring many of his Penthouse ""Pets"", the film really does abandon all hope of any sort of legitimacy. No one can take a historical epic seriously when it's interspliced with all sorts and forms of very pornographic sex scenes. I know that there's always an argument to be made in regards to ""Art Versus Pornography"", and I'm usually one to almost always take the side of art, because when a film or other art form shows unsimulated sex, it tends to not be designed to arouse or titillate. But with CALIGULA, there's no such pretension. It KNOWS what it's trying to do, and while it doesn't work too well on that end either, there's still something glorious about the fact that this film exists. Obviously in the years following its release, CALIGULA has gained something of a cult following, and rightly so. This is pretty much a film that is tailor-made for midnight showings at arthouse cinemas around the world. It has everything those audiences love: Bad performances, bad directing, bad cinematography, bad editing, hilarious line readings, graphic nudity, violence and sex all masquerading as an epic film. It's everything people loved about the grindhouse cinema of the 70's, but with all the pretense of historical biographical drama.

If you're going to see CALIGULA, don't see the R-Rated version. It's twice as bad as anything else this film otherwise has to offer. See the ""Unrated"" cut (We all know it was rated X, and now would be NC-17). It's the kind of gonzo, no-holds-barred, nothing-is-off-limits filmmaking insanity that, love it or hate it, you still kind of have to admire it.",1387843200,4,3581,4.993299832495812

We see all the killing, sex, political intrigue, and general nastiness of the Roman empire at its height and decline. This 2008 2-disc (1 BD & 1 DVD) Imperial Edition Blu-Ray is a deluxe release of a very powerful film. Caligula was released in both X (156 min) and R-Rated (153) versions.

The special features are ported over from the 3-disc DVD release of Caligula. This set is a fan's dream but those who dislike the film won't change their mind about it. You are getting 2 cuts, 3 commentaries and about 90 minutes in bonus supplements.

Special Features:
- Three feature-length audio commentaries with stars Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and on-set writer Ernest Volkman

Buy this film if you can handle the hardcore violence and sex. My only complaint is that the video is drab and the audio is just OK (although this is the best the film has ever looked it is not high-quality HD due to how it was originally filmed).",1377216000,4,1565,4.924242424242424

635859,5,6303364438,"Shipping: I have always had a very good experience with Amazon, and this was no exception. They shipped the movie very quickly with no problem and even arrived before the delivery date.

DVD: As far as box sets go the Imperial Edition of Caligula is the only way to go if you are thinking of buying this film. It has the X rated version of the film, and a pre-release version of the movie, and a third disc with many special features on it. The box set doesn't include the R rated version, but in all honesty, that version takes away what makes Caligula so good, so stay away from that version.

The Film: Caligula is one of my all time favorite movies, but you have to be careful who you are watching it with. Caligula contains many scenes of graphic violence and strong sexual content throughout the who entire 2 and a half hour film. As far as film goes, it shows one of the very few movies that gives us the raw unflinching nature of pagan Rome. Malcolm McDowell gives what should have been an Oscar nominated performance, and it has some of the most brilliant sets you could ever see in any movie. Caligula has a very haunting score that can give you chills when listening to it.

Overview: So Caligula definitely lives up to the hype that it caused when it was released, but that shouldn't be your only reason to view it. Caligula is a very powerful film that makes you think, but not too hard. Check it out if you can, but stay away from the R rated version, because pagan Rome wasn't censored, so why view a film about it in a censored form.",1376697600,7,1549,4.316151202749141
635860,5,6303364438,"I've seen lots of pornography in my time and I'll hardly call this pornography. This film was very beautiful and fantastic and quite an ambitious project for its time. Its just an art-house film with lots of nudity and sex. No different that would you would see today but with accurate historical elements. If all you see is porn or all you want to see it porn here, you must be looking for pornography and I suggest you rent porn. This is a cinematic achievement. The sets, the acting, the story, make up- all in all- a good product. Most, who are in themselves puritans, would see this as porn for they have no sense of what artistic expression really involves. If there is nudity, it must be porn, right? wrong! Sex, nudity, the human naked or nude body, aroused or not, and all that encompasses it can be quite artistic and it is shown here with various degrees of visual artistry. If you want to rent this film because you'd like to see porn for sexual stimulation then why not rent a real porn that has no story or artistic value. Pornographic material ultimate goal is to stimulate you to orgasm. I hardly think that was the point of Caligula. So please, be less illiterate and ignorant for there is some history going on here both for its time, 1979, and as a period piece from pagan Rome.",1376352000,,1297,4.430962343096234

It is so graphic and so shocking that it will put the average viewer in a state of disbelief at what they are seeing on the screen much of the time, even if those individuals are not known to be particularly prudish. This uncut version is truly discusting and very shocking. It is filled with constant full frontal nudity by both men and women, people having actual sex of every imaginable kind. Men having oral sex with men, lesbian sex, people urinating on each other, orgies taking place where dozens of people are actualy having sex right in front of world renowned actors, Sex with dildos and other objects, and even acts so discusting I dare even mention them here. There is plenty of pretty graphic and sadistic violence as well. And most of all it is still hard to imagine the man who once played Lawrence of Arabia reciting his lines while people are actually having sex right in front of him. But the thing that amazes me about this movie is how good the acting actually is. How incredible the sets and costumes are, and the script isn't really too bad either. This is the biggest budget adult film ever made. I can't understand how major actors like John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren, and Malcolm McDowell ever agreed to do this movie. Caligula is truly a sick movie, but it is so well made that it is hard to ignore. Only the most depraved people on earth can sit through this film without being rather shocked.

636223,3,6303364438,"As the title suggests, this movie is one of a kind. The only thing that saves this picture from being pure porn, is the fact that it shows history in a very unrepentant light. Peter O'Toole as the aging decrepit lecher Tiberius was incredible acting and no doubt the now paradise isle of Capri was in his time, every bit the lecher's palace it was reputed to be and he was as mercurial and dangerous in his senility as he was portrayed. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Caligula who was raised on Capri under the aging emperor's watchful and dangerous scrutiny and behaved as he could, much like his Uncle Claudius who also played the idiot in order to survive the dangerous monarchs under which he was forced to live. As was said in some other reviews the sex portrayed in this picture was with a jaded view and the banquets seen were possibly more like what actually was than the usual view of the obligatory fat men besmeared with wine. Considering the climate of the time, it was a wonder Nerva didn't slit his wrists sooner. My sympathies actually laid with Macro, the Captain Prefect who tried to play two ends against the middle and killed Tiberius to help Caligula only to fall victim himself when Caligula had him killed for the murder, Longinus the long suffering treasurer who had to bend under Caligula's crazed policy, Drusilla, his sister, the only voice of reason in the young Emperor's madness, and Chaerea, the new Prefect who became increasingly disgruntled enough with Caligula's mercurial nature to finally take a sword to him to end it. This was not the Rome of Cecil B. Demille or the big buget classics, but rather, a Rome that was a bit more real and much less appetizing, more like the Rome that existed in the heyday of the mad Emperors, the one a time traveler is more likely to find---and much less likely to want to explore.

Ultimately, it's an XXX production, no matter how you attempt to classify it. It's of relatively little historical value. I don't condemn the movie outright, but a more well known producer / director would have certainly done this differently and engaged the viewer with their view of Caligula's reign minus the gratuitous sex scenes.

To this day I don't know what the purpose of this movie was. In its current unrated version it's not viewable anywhere except venues that display pornographic movies. An historical cinematic anomaly for sure.

Its hard-core porn, violence, and scenes of excess are mild compared to Pasolini's LAST DAYS OF SODOM or Fellini (directors Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione clearly quote from both directors), while the performances are varied, to say the least. O'Toole shouts his lines as if perpetually drunk, while Mirren's so-called 'erotic' dance in front of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) lacks passion, to say the least. She doesn't even cut as sexy a presence as Amanda Barrie's Cleopatra in CARRY ON CLEO (1965).  On the other hand, the film does have a certain fascination, if only for its ingenious of lighting, music and dance; this is a fantasy-world of unbridled lust and passion where absolutely anything goes.

I believe that whatever and whoever Caligula was--a brutal, eccentric, and extravagant Roman emperor, and a mentally ill and sexually promiscuous man--his life, world, and almost-four-year reign simply cannot be fully shown in a rated version.

With movies like this one (extreme violence and explicit sex), opinions understandably run high--you either love it or hate it. I am one of those people who actually liked the film. It was thrilling and gripping, Malcolm McDowell's performance as Caligula was phenomenal, and the musical soundtrack, absolutely marvelous. Although the movie was shocking and even disgusting at times, based on what I'd ever watched or read on the ancient Romans, and on Caligula in particular, I was mostly ready for it and not very much appalled or surprised. I also found the movie  fairly historically accurate, but even if I didn't, I wouldn't have given it a different rating (unless it were fantastic and totally absurd, of course): Caligula is just a history-inspired film, not an educational documentary; it is entertainment and wasn't meant as anything but.

As for the movie's cons, it was too long, and it dragged at some parts. Caligula was not an easy movie to watch, and two and a half hours of it was just too much. I think it could have been better if a bit shorter.

Caligula is definitely not suitable for anyone under the age of twenty-one, but if you are not a squeamish and sensitive adult who gets easily offended, you should give it a try--you might like it.",1351900800,,1688,4.810344827586207

Malcolm McDowell acted in the film, but did not perform nearly as well as he did in Clockwork Orange or Evilenko, (two much better films to buy if you are a Malcolm McDowell fan like me), although I am sure he had fun.  However, Teresa Ann Savoy does great job acting in my opinion.

I am surprise that mixed with all the phony debauchery there is a real story. This is the only thing that brings it up a notch from ""Fellini Satyricon"" (1969)",1341619200,,581,4.361111111111111

636796,2,6303364438,"Curiosity made me watch it.

It was billed, repeatedly, as shocking and offensive, I had to see why.  That's my excuse and I'm sticking with it.

First of all, a good example of too many cooks spoiling the broth.  Seems as if everyone but Francis the talking mule had a hand in either the filming, writing, editing, or starring in this epic.  People were fired, scenes reshot, it went from being titled Gore Vidal's Caligula, to just plain old Caligula.  Lots of lawsuits were leveled, making me wonder why Caligula didn't also show up with a defamation of character suit against Guccione.  It's a bio-picture after all, just how accurate can it be if there are so few records of Caligula and those were by people who didn't like him.  Let's just say it wasn't a flattering portrayal and let it go at that.
I'm more curious as to how they convinced John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Helen Mirren into taking part in this venture, did they list it on their resumes afterwards?  I doubt they could say they didn't know what was going on though.  To their credit, all three performed like troopers with less than sterling material (the revised dialog, co-written by Malcolm McDowell is a little on the silly side, very grandiose).  McDowell must have thought they were doing an avant-garde piece as opposed to a little smut and a whole lot of posturing on his part.  Pity he was on screen for the duration, hammy is the kindest term I could apply to what he was doing (it was less a performance and more a means to grope, mince, smirk, and go all bug-eyed).  His acting was actually the most shocking and offensive thing in this misguided project.
Obviously, they spent a fortune on the 64 sets, which included a nautical brothel.  Oddly enough, they filmed them all in long shots so the detailed work was lost; making it pointless.  The camera work was erratic and inconsistent (not surprising considering it's the work of many).  The editing was also peculiar and was also the work of many.  The overall effect of the piece was stagey, static.  Characters stood about and delivered their speeches, close-ups were reserved for the orgy sequences.  It was very bizarre, very amateur.  All I kept thinking was, at least they saved a fortune on costumes (bed sheets, by the look of it, those who were actually draped).
As for the most `controversial film of all time' claim, I wasn't all that outraged by what I viewed in the COMPLETE, UNEDITED AND UNRATED EDITION.  Only one scene was disturbing to me, the killing of a child by bashing her head against a marble staircase.  I could have gone without seeing that.  The rest, eh.

It's the brainchild of Robert Guccione, publisher of Penthouse Magazine who produced two versions of the film - one 90 minute version for most audiences and a 160 minute version which is pure hardcore porn.  I saw the 90-minute version which was porn enough for me.

Loosely based on the life of the Roman Emperor Caligula, with a cast of hundreds, the plot shows Caligula, played by Malcolm McDowell as the mentally deranged emperor in an incestuous relationship with his sister.  There's an excruciating death scene with former emperor Tiberious and then the film goes downhill from there.  Against a background of hundreds of nude females, the new emperor goes about his merry way, implementing the most gruesome tortures just for the pleasure of it.  Even when it wasn't supposed to be torture, there is a public birthing scene that made me cringe in horror.

The cast did the best they could, with Malcolm McDowell certainly looking mentally unbalanced, but I couldn't help feeling disgusted throughout and feeling somewhat dirty after the film was over.  There is no way I could possibly recommend it to anyone.  Stay away from this film.

Actors Peter O'Toole and Sir John Gielgud did not know they had added the ""hardcore"" scenes.

  It is Pagan Rome, the time of 37AD - 41AD. Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) is always making love to women, even if it is someone's wife. He wants power. He visits Tiberious (Peter O'Toole). He has many slaves, which he calls ""little fishes"" and invites them into his pool. Most of his subjects do not wear clothing. Nerva (John Gielgud) believes he is too old to be living and is unhappy with life. He attempts to commit suicide. Caligula is excited and asked him if he sees Isis. Nerva tells him, ""No!"". So Caligula pushes him in the water. Caligula is jealous of Tiberious and his lifestyle. He tries to kill him too, but Marco enters the room and finishes the act of crime. This makes Caligula the Emperor, but he wants to be King of Rome.

636832,3,6303364438,"As usual Amazon have lumped all the reviews of the different versions of this film together - the four disc UK PAL 'Imperial Edition' this review refers to, the one-disc uncut version, the one-disc cut version, the three-disc US version, the BluRay (which includes the uncut version and the extras but not the alternate cuts)...

What to make of the notorious Caligula? It's not really porno, not really an epic, not really a drama - it's just a kind of Mulligan's Stew of a movie. The film is a mess and exists in lots of versions, with the three on the UK DVD not even covering half of them. The hardcore sex in the infamous unrated cut that was added by producer and Penthouse magazine owner Bob Guccione (who looks like a blinged up 70s Caesar in the accompanying documentary and who made the film as a tax deductible write-off against Penthouse's publishing profits) after shooting was finished has surprisingly been left uncut by the UK censors. Yet for all their publicity value, the porn inserts are more distracting than arousing and curious for what was intended as a mainstream commercial porn film because there's such an awful lot of male nudity in the unerotic unsimulated sex among the extras that it makes you wonder what team the producer was batting for.

Despite legend, they're not the sole reason director Tinto Brass and writer Gore Vidal disowned the film: the former did so because much of it was re-edited out of sequence after he was fired in post-production, the later because his script was changed so much (Brass ended up with a `principal photography by' credit while the only writing credit is `based on a script by Gore Vidal'). The original intention to make a more historically accurate and defiantly pagan Roman epic outside the studio system without the restrictions of a PG rating would be better achieved more than a quarter of a century later with HBO's Rome, while at the time it looked like a pale shadow of the BBC's noticeably much lower funded but infinitely better written I, Claudius. Unfortunately Malcolm McDowell wanted to play Caligula as an anarchist destroying Rome from within rather than just another madman - a potentially intriguing interpretation - but pointedly didn't want to do any gay scenes despite playing a bisexual. The producer was more interested in the box-office potential of an X-rated epic. It was never going to end happily for anyone concerned...

It's not exactly historically accurate, but then with Caligula running a close second to Nero as cinema's favorite mad emperor and most surviving accounts of his reign highly partisan, that's perhaps not too surprising. Caligula was actually one of the most popular Caesars with the public in his lifetime, initiating major reforms that made life better for the plebs while increasingly frustrating the senate and aristocracy, who had been running things their way for years in Tiberius' absence and didn't like suddenly being second best. The first two years of his reign were something of a golden age: the economy boomed, he started no wars, caused no major disasters and killed surprisingly few people, none of them members of his immediate family (a bit of a rarity for a Caesar), and even reintroduced democracy and instituted tax cuts and civic building programmes. And when his behavior did become more questionable, it was generally the upper class who bore the brunt of it rather than the unwashed masses. Indeed, so extraordinarily popular was Caligula with the people at the time of his assassination that attempts to restore the Republic were thwarted by mass demonstrations of public anger.

While there's general agreement his reign deteriorated after a near fatal illness and mental illness, most of the worst stories of his madness and perversion come from Suetonius' gloriously gossipy Lives of the Twelve Caesars, written 80 years after his death, so it's probable that despite his promiscuity the stories of incestuous relations with three of his sisters and the more outrageous acts of insanity that captured the public imagination for centuries may not even be true (it was fairly common practice to highlight and exaggerate earlier emperor's failings to make the current incumbent look better, something Suetonius would have been well aware of as the Emperor Hadrian's secretary). Indeed, even the name Caligula is something of a misnomer. He ruled as Gaius Caesar Germanicus: Caligula was a childhood nickname given to him by his father's troops meaning `bootikins' or little boots (caligulae), and its use after his death was a good way of belittling him as a figure of infantile ridicule as he became a victim of the same negative political spin that he himself pioneered against his predecessor, Tiberius. He was certainly a very flawed individual: paranoid, promiscuous with both sexes yet sanctimoniously moralistic, theatrical, mentally ill (possibly as a result of neurosyphilis) and often unnecessarily combative with little realpolitikal acumen, though they're not uncommon qualities in rulers (you could almost see him as the ancient world's King Ludwig of Bavaria). He wasn't a great Caesar by any standards, but he wasn't a particularly bad or monstrous one compared to many that followed him either, and he doesn't fit any standard definition of a tyrant. But then, given the choice between a flawed mentally ill reformer and a raving tyrannical madman, authors and filmmakers have always opted to print the legend. And with Caligula, they finally got the chance to film all the mucky bits the censors never would have let them get away with in the 50s and 60s.

It does have a car-crash fascination, though, and you can see the film it once wanted to be from time to time, as well as why it went so wrong. You'll have McDowell, Peter O'Toole (made up like a lecherous Albert Steptoe ogling his `little fishes') and John Gielgud speaking elegant Gore Vidal dialogue while extras play with themselves in the background, often in shots taken from completely different parts of the movie. It's shot on huge stages that are part Las Vegas (you almost expect Siegfried and Roy to turn up doing the floor show), part grand opera, with proscenium arch staging to match. Part Fellini-wannabe, part Visconti-wannabe, the over-riding impression at times is that it's the kind of film King Ludwig of Bavaria would have made.

Despite all the excess the $17.5m budget could buy back in 1976 and the odd grand image like a giant mourning cloth slowly floating down on the whipped and cowering senators, it's not exactly a grand spectacle - the film rarely leaves the Palace, though there is one vivid street scene where play actors depict the Roman class system as a human pyramid with the people sandwiched between the army and the slaves at the bottom and Caligula angrily trying to bring the whole edifice crashing down. As the film progresses, he becomes more dedicated to chaos, reducing the senate to baaing like sheep after they make him a god, using their wives as whores, all the while thinking they are mad for approving everything he does. ""I don't know what else to do to provoke them,"" he laments at one point. Yet the film never seems to have an especially clear idea of what it wants to do or where it's going, the several years (!!!) it spent in the editing room and the uncredited rewrites during the nightmarish shoot all too apparent as it lurches along like a slightly distracted drunk caught somewhere between having drunk too much but still not quite enough.

The four-disc Imperial edition DVD available in the UK offers three different cuts of the film, none of them a director's cut. The first disc has the uncut X-rated version re-edited by Guccione, the second, described as an alternate `pre-release version,' an attempt to reconstruct something similar to Tinto Brass' original intentions that puts scenes back in their proper chronological order and drops some of the more gratuitous sexual footage such as Penthouse Pet Lori Wagner's lengthy lesbian scene, and - only in the UK set - a peculiar 102-minute R-rated cut from 1999. This short version isn't so much edited as hacked ruthlessly as if someone took it upon themselves to whip the uppity film into submission once and for all. It's not just the jarring and clumsy removal of most of the violence and the softcore as well as hardcore sex, it's the sheer nonsensical nature of the editing that strikes you. Cutting far more than the censors required - nearly an entire hour - it loses many of the film's most memorable and important moments (the humiliation of the newlywed couple, the fever that causes Caligula to believe himself a god and causes his sister's death), leaving the remnants often laughably bizarre nonsequiters or just plain confusing. Some of the cast in the credits are nowhere to be found in the UK version.

The set is certainly loaded with extras - three audio commentaries on the `pre-release version,' trailers, 79 minutes of home movie footage of the shoot, stills galleries and two early draft screenplay by Vidal among them. I know that sounds like saying you buy Playboy for the articles, but they are sometimes more fun than the film. The 48 minutes of deleted footage on the alternate version is deceptive - it's actually raw footage, much of it not even assembled, all mute and only about half of it in colour. Aside from one sequence of Caligula making love to his sister, the shots are either alternate takes of scenes in the film, trims or alternate angles of deleted scenes that feature on the UK edition's third disc. None add anything to the film, although the clumsily staged raw footage of unenthusiastic extras fumbling their way through the orgy at Tiberius' retreat and abruptly stopping every time they wrongly assume the camera is no longer on them does show how difficult it must be to shoot a decent sex scene.

The third UK disc includes another 31 minutes of deleted material taken from worn work prints that aren't included on the US DVD, including raw footage of the depravities in Tiberius' grotto and an additional 11 scenes in rough cut form, most of them cut from the latter section of the film after Drusilla's death that would have given the film a wider view of Caligula's reign and do show the much more ambitious but no more successful picture intended - much of the film's last third hit the cutting room floor on all versions, as did much of Helen Mirren's role. Unfortunately many of them simply aren't very good or don't quite work, such as Caligula avoiding raising taxes by theatrically setting himself above Jupiter and liberating the god's treasury, a scene not helped by awkward sped-up moments. Other scenes, such as the emperor replacing the heads of statues of the gods with his own head and rehearsing the camp march he makes the legionaries do at the imperial brothel, no longer have full sound and tend to spotlight some terrible work from John Steiner that would have undermined his character had they remained in the film. But McDowell's interest in making the character more of an anarchist comes over in a scene where he playfully plans famines and sea battles to liven things up while nimbly walking over desktops, makes his horse a senator to undermine the ruling class and appeal to the people and a lengthy bedroom scene with Helen Mirren about the dangers of goading and humiliating the senate. Without them, there's less of a sense of his continual emasculation of the old ruling class by piling on outrage after outrage building up to the point where his assassination becomes inevitable. There's also striking footage of his horse being chased by slaves as he dies twitching in the film's final scene, as well as the conclusion of the `Death Machine' sequence where he has his guards throw Proculus into its path only for him to survive.

While a new documentary about the making of the film could be fascinating, the accompanying one-hour documentary on the DVD dates from the film's release, though it's hard to tell who it was made for since it includes a lot of hardcore footage that would have kept it off even cable TV. Sadly there's no input from Vidal, who sued Guccione to have the film retitled Gore Vidal's Caligula and then, on seeing it, sued again to have his name taken off, nor is there the infamous spoof trailer for a remake he, Mirren and director Francesco Vezzoli made in 2005. Director Tinto Brass, one of the Penthouse Pets who is now a living monument to Cher's plastic surgeon, and Italian schlock-fixture John Steiner (openly admitting most of his films are crap and he's no interest in seeing Caligula) do contribute lengthy interview featurettes, what I've heard of Helen Mirren's audio commentary is fairly good (though nothing thus far to match her onset comment that ""It has an irresistible mixture of art and genitals in it"") but Malcolm McDowell's commentary is definitely the big attraction here - at one point he even pauses mid-anecdote to compliment Teresa Ann Savoy's naked derriere!",1301270400,18,13040,4.896380090497738

636907,5,6303364438,"If you expect to be intellectually edified and historically informed after viewing Bob Guccione's film Caligula, you will be enraged upon viewing this gargantuan, Preminger-esque porn extravaganza.

Caligula (the film) has many things going for it; notably viable dialogue, largely contributed by Gore Vidal who, I believe, disowned this film once he got wind of the direction the film script was going in the hands of the producers, and wildly imaginative set pieces that are probably not too far off the mark in regards to what Rome looked like in 40 A.D.  It also boasts an impressive cast of stars who seem to have believed in the project by forcing themselves to pretend they were making a movie for Lindsay Anderson (O Lucky Man) or Stanley Kubrick (Clockwork Orange).  In fact, the ever-splendid Peter O'Toole gives a chilling, scary performance as Tiberius Caesar, Caligula's grandfather.  His dying emperor reminds me of Willem Dafoe's character in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, very dangerous and very insane.  Tiberius, like all the historical individuals in most films about Rome, is completely bogus here, but O'Toole falls into the spirit of the cartoony nature of this flick and has a grand old time going WAY over the top as he would love to have done in every movie he's made.  He is at his best in these kinds of roles, see The Ruling Class and The Lion in Winter.

The English are nothing if not mercenary in a very practical sense, so the producers of Caligula were able to entice the great John Gielgud to give them one of his programmed performances for a, no doubt, very high fee for 10 minutes of film time.
And I expect he enjoyed all the naked people running around in his scenes on the isle of Capri.  Good work if you can get it.

The historic person, Gaius Caligula, was a huge man according to the historians, who was hairy, bald and brawny.  We have quite a different impression of this man stemming from the really off-base character in I Claudius, played by the otherwise great John Hurt, and this version here, played by a similarly wan and blonde, English, naughty choirboy type.  Malcolm MacDowell has stated that he now knew what it was like to be a whore.  Well, I expect he had a pretty good idea of that before this project, but having said that, he certainly seems to be enjoying himself enormously as this fantasy anti-hero, Caligula Caesar, who spends his days and nights fornicating with girls and fisting the boys.

Helen Mirren seems game for anything and it isn't all that surprising to see her flailing her enormous breasts about in priapic rituals in old Roma.  Mirren was always a superb actress who has shown over the years how versatile and adventurous she is when choosing roles, and she does them all brilliantly.  After Caligula was made she went on, years later, to star in Peter Greenaway's shocking, often disgusting film The Cook, the thief, his wife and her lover, finally making her way to Buckingham Palace as Queen Elizabeth II.  An amazing career when you look at her curriculum vitae.

These four stars make for engaging viewing between orgies and atrocities, which are, in themselves, interesting to watch, if you have the stomach for it.

Caligula is a movie for people who appreciate the beauty of the human body and are not averse to seeing it on display in a wide array of positions and activities.  The dialogue is not nauseatingly inane because Guccione opted to concentrate on the sex stuff so few words were needed to add on to Vidal's work.  What a con!  The man was a genius.

The film is made slightly cheesy, in an appropriate manner for a porn flick, by the use of 'classical' music by Aram Khachaturian and Serge Prokofiev, recorded in Mantovani-like ffffFrequency sound; lots of swooning violins in an indoor pool environment, sort of thing, alternating with blaring Ben Hur-like brass fanfares and bombast.

The sets, as I stated, are first class, no expense was spared on the production and is in many ways beautiful to behold.
Guccione was the Preminger porn kings.

It's an awful, boring film that has gotten even worse with age because the shocking material isn't unique anymore. If you want to see it for the explicit sex scenes, troll the web where you can find them for free. It's just not worth watching the entire movie. The direction is awkward and aimless, the edits are jarring, the sets, costumes and make-up are amateurish, and the acting of the secondary players is weak. Malcolm McDowell makes a valiant effort to give his character some depth, but he's no miracle-worker. In fact, the only person able to rise above the material and bring some dignity to the proceedings is, not surprisingly, Helen Mirren. I really don't see any point to this film other than to shock audiences with sex and violence, and as I said, this won't even necessarily work for today's viewers; ""Nine Songs"" and ""Hostel"", just to throw out two examples, are far more convincing in each category.

Funny thing is that I think I saw it when it first appeared, imagining incorrectly that it might be more erotic than bleak.  Afterward, I pretended I had seen a different film.  Closest I'll ever get to being like O'Toole or Gielgud.

Bloody, decadent and very openly sexual. I also have read that the more famous actors in this movie had no idea about the additional scenes.

At least I managed to sit through it all, was amazed how graphic the sex scenes were considering when it was made.

The legendary decadence of Rome is exceeded only by Guccione's depiction of it -- excessive, often gratutious sex and cruelty were, I assume, intended to frame the story of the rise and fall of Caligula, certainly a 'man of his times'. The effort, however, is an uncomfortable mix of cinematic sexual indluence and the telling of the story of a decadent and corrupt Roman imperial state. The cast, including McDowell, Helen Mirrin, Sir John Gielgood, among others is exceptional; but, their efforts are frequently overshadowed by the directors obsession with putting his perception of sexual decadence on screen. It is as if there are two movies, here: a tale of a corrupt emperor of a #politically# decadent state, and a tableau of
sex, physical deformities, torture, executions and the like. What may have been shocking and riveting in the 1980s is fairly boring by the standards of the 21st century.

Consider the move ""Jaws."" Was it a good film or a bad film? It was a bloody film that kept millions of people from swimming, anywhere! But, it did make an impression. Do you own it? Why? For posterity? Perhaps.

Movies rarely get the credit they deserve when they upset the norm and put bible-thumpers at the ready. The protestors and the holy alike will chase art and creativity out of town before the townsfolk can make a decision on their own about the quality. Remember the Exorcist? The clergy had their vestals in a bunch over that one. Because of that, the move never did make it to some towns and when it did, people were practically considered outcasts if they were recognized going in or out of the theatre.

637132,3,6303364438,"In some ways, this film is a unique cultural product, that demonstrates the tension between historic fact and imaginative embellishment; between the craft of fine acting and pornography; and between the contrasting philosophies of the artists responsible for this collage of intentions. This review will look at all three of these contrasts.

Many of the events in this film come down to us as part of the historic record. The rise and fall of these characters was documented by historians of the time and in following generations. However, in this production the events are embellished to the extreme so that the film becomes nightmarish or surreal. The costumes are akin to the flimsy costumes worn by strippers. The lives of Tiberius and Caligula and Claudius offer incredible drama and decadence as related in Suetonius' Live of the Caesars and in Robert Graves' I, Claudius.  Yet we know enough of Roman culture and daily life to understand that these characters were aberrations and products of madness and absolute power. The average Roman did not act this way and were scandalized by the behaviors of Tiberius and Caligula.  The beautiful young lovers, Livia and Proculus, exemplify this in the film. The terrible deeds that are inflicted on this handsome and innocent couple are a critical aspect of the film for they demonstrate the violation of commonly-held moral behaviors by those in absolute power who also are mentally deranged. This is a critical point in understanding this film. The absolute power of the Julio-Claudians family, of which Tiberius and Caligula were emperors 3 and 4, surrounds itself with immoral fortune seekers and parasites, that reflect back to the source of power a sense that their cruelty is indeed just fun and games, that their abuse of power is justified because of the baseness of human nature and that the people they rule are scum.  An important scene in the film depicts Caligula forcing the entire Senate to make sheep sounds while he gleefully laughs at the ability of his absolute power to create absurd behaviors in others.

The second theme that any reviewer must address is the contrast between actors with top tier reputations combining their art with that of pornographers. John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Helen Mirren are highly respected and are the three strongest actors in this production. It is actually hard to judge the acting of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula since the character is so wildly overstated and dominant. McDowell plays Caligula as highly intelligent, highly indulged, and sadistically deranged. Again we are less concerned with his violent outbursts against the self serving court favorites as we are about his treatment of the lovers, Livia and Proculus, the moral center of the production. As an example, handsome and ruthless and cunning Macro is outsmarted by Caligula and comes to a terrible end, but the viewer could care less because we have learned that Macro is corrupted and power seeking. However the violation of Livia and Proculus on their wedding night and then the subsequent violence against Proculus is horrifying. As they torture Proculus he screams asking why such pain is being inflicted on him since he is a loyal lower rank military officer. Caligula answers that it is because he is not guilty that he is guilty. It is because he is not corrupt that he must be destroyed. Absolute power in combination with sadism is the recipe for human evil. But beyond Caligula, we must remember that power over others in combination with inability to experience empathy with the other is one strong source of the evil we may all experience in everyday life.

This last point brings up the contrasting and conflicting visions of Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione, the owner of Penthouse and the producer of the film.  If you are familiar with the excellent novels and essays of Gore Vidal, you soon learn of his contention that when Republics become Empires they lose their moral footing and begin to inflict cruelty and oppression against those they conquer and begin to stimulate decadence in the lives of the privileged individuals who have risen in the social class structure of the Empire.  Thus the decadence of Tiberius and Caligula and the suicide of Nerva all help convey his message that Empire and power corrupts.  But Bob Guccione has a philosophy against censorship and sexual oppression, and therefore he inserted many pornographic sequences into the film in the final edits, as if to thumb his nose at the moral sensibilities of those that run our current Empire. At first glance it would appear to be that Vidal and Guccione would be allies in their assault against the Empire. Vidal would accost the Empire for turning from its Republican roots and suppressing other nations for the aggrandizement of the Empire. Guccione would accost the Empire for sexual hypocrisy and lack of sexual freedoms. However it is the manner in which they accost the Empire that differs, and style and taste matter. For Vidal wishes us to draw upon our intellectual history and challenge the Empire on historic and rational grounds founded in the Enlightenment whereas Guccione wishes to challenge the Empire with sexual truths that often stay inside the bedroom but become unnerving when viewed in the light of day or on the motion picture screen.

637176,4,6303364438,"It's hard to view this film divorced from its controversy.  To see spliced-in pornographic acts performed in a film so sumptuously photographed blurs our aesthetics; or it did mine, anyway.  Whatever the final opinion, it was definitely never boring.  Along with the nearly constant atrocities stemming from a complete abuse and debasement of power, it has stunning visuals going for it.  Therefore a revitalized hi-def transfer makes an excellent opportunity to see it afresh.  After watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula-Blu-ray/dp/B001DWNUCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula [Blu-ray</a>] (""The Imperial Edition""), and delving into all the extras, I've concluded that, despite its many flaws, it is indeed a good film.  By all accounts, it could have been a GREAT film, but as often is the case with ambitious visions, conflicts led to too many compromises, eventuating to no one's satisfaction.  There will never be a critical consensus on it, but still, anyone interested in films has to conclude it has its merits.  This edition makes that obvious.

To sum it up, Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula as mirthfully cruel, irreverent, and giddily insane.  John Gielgud, making an early departure, plays with erect Shakespearean dignity Tiberius' only friend, the wise Nerva, contemptuous of the inevitable scenario of Rome's further decline at Caligula's ascendancy.  Peter O'Toole portrays Tiberius as demoralized and sardonically embittered by the trappings of power, his face scabby and scalp clumpy from the ravages of syphilis.  Once Tiberius dies -- all of the actors with major theater credentials exit relatively early -- Caligula has the playground of Rome all to himself.

Having never seen the remastered SD special edition released a couple of years ago, I'm unable to compare its image quality to the transfer on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula-Blu-ray/dp/B001DWNUCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula [Blu-ray</a>].  But I can state with certainty that this Blu-ray edition is far superior to the initial DVD issued back in the 1990s.  Art director and costume designer Danilo Donati gave cinematographer Silvano Ippoliti a lively palette and grand designs to work with, and it's illuminated here.  While the age of the print is apparent at times, the hi-def transfer revives the lost vibrancy of the draped luxury and pillared architecture.  And aside from the brighter picture, there's a cornucopia tucked away in the special features.

The extras include two versions of ""The Making of Caligula""; interviews (about 30 minutes each) with director Tinto Brass, actor John Steiner (who portrayed Longinus), and Penthouse pet Lori Wagner (who, in hindsight, realizes she was in way over her head, thanks to her blind ambition); three audio commentaries (McDowell, Helen Mirren, and on-set writer Ernest Volkman); an alternate pre-release version of the film; and, rounding out the set, the usual odds and ends (deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, and so on).  This two-disc edition comes with a 15-page booklet detailing the film's troubled production, in which the essayist R. J. Buffalo concludes passionately that a full restoration to its original vision is in order.  It's a hell-freezes-over probability.  From the artifacts among the bonus features, it's obvious that two immutable creative forces were in direct conflict.  Gore Vidal, who wrote the original screenplay, eventually disavowed the film when director Brass altered how Caligula himself was presented.  It must have come down to an interpretation of the script, because Vidal's earlier version is included as a DVD-ROM extra, and a lot of the dialogue was retained, some of it word for word.  So, on the one hand, you have Brass wanting a sexually explicit, anarchistic romp; on the other you have Vidal's depiction of Caligula as derisive of the ruling class, and abuses power as mockery.  The result is a schizophrenic montage.  In my judgment, Vidal's vision edges out ahead slightly, as by the time you get to all that explicit sex, they're not festivities you'd want to be invited to.  So the question remains, to whose vision would the final edit be restored?

637177,5,6303364438,"You are probably tired of comments on this movie.  It is basically a Penthouse porno hiding behind an older version of the same movie.  Since I am used to hard core, I didn't flinch during most of the sex scenes.

However, I was not happy with on major historical inaccuracy of the flick.  Claudius, the successor to Caligual was portrayed and a slobbering idiot with an almost mentally retarded character.  This was a tremendous injustice.  Claudius was, according to the historians, a very timid soul with a severe speech impediment.  He was embarassed to speak in public and held most of his council with (I think) one of his female cousins).  Ironically, Claudius was quite intelligent and, over the period of his reign, turned out to be one of the most effective of the Caesars.  Two of his most deirable traits were an incorruptable nature, a sense of fairness and beneath it all, a kind and generous disposition.  It might be challenged as a historical fact, but I think he suffered from epilepsy.

If you are interested in an accurate portrayal of Claudius, check out the PBS/BBC series ""I Claudius"" which aired many years ago.  I think it's available on Netflix, and, used to be listed in the Acorn catalog.  There are several hours of programming, and sometimes it drags.

1. Thought of as a surreal black comedy
2. Scripted as a homoerotic political satire
3. Shot as an erotic mindflip of a movie
4. Edited as a disaster
5. Released as a disaster.

What could have been a great film was ruined by one man: Bob Guccione. Tinto Brass and Gore Vidal had shot 95% of the footage, and Bob GUccione had shot about 5 hours of ""sexy"" material to make this a ""T-ts-and-arse-and-gore"", 6 minutes of which had ended up in the movie. He then went to edit an AWESOME satire of Caligula's atrocities into a disaster of a movie. The acting was great, and Malcom McDowell outdid himself as Caligula. The film has many great scenes, including the nervous breakdown from Caligula. Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass had disowned the film because Bob Guccione would lock Tinto Brass outside the editing room. If the film had been edited properly, It would have been a great film.

The recut version on this DVD has scenes edited back the way they were meant to be edited, but 5 quick Gooch inserts were left in by a mistake. It's worth watching though. And the film must be seen to be believed. You may love it, you may hate it. I know I didn't hate it or love it.

Stage and cinema royalty including Sir Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud and Dame Helen Mirren (only Gielgud was knighted at the time) joined Malcolm McDowell and a collection of Italian and European actors in an orgy of violence and sex which included graphic XXX pornography taken directly from the pages of Seutonius' chapter on Caligula in the second century book The Twelve Caesars.

Alas, the 200 plus minute Guccione edited version, which was rumoured to have been shown to preview audiences in Italy, is not included in this set and in fact may no longer exist.

It is now well known that the film that Vidal wrote and Director Tinto Brass shot are not what was finally released after Guccione took control of the editing and shut Brass out of the production. To bridge huge continuity gaps Guccione and his editors extensively used out-takes and rehearsal footage rescued from rubbish bins. The documentary material provides fascinating information about what might have been a masterpiece had Brass been allowed to edit the film he shot and do pick up shots, retakes and the shooting of much needed new scenes which would become self evident in the editing stage.

Thanks to the documentary material, we get to fully appreciate the incredible production design, the magnitude and details of the various sets and the beautiful costumes made by Production Designer Danilo Donati and his team. This is not always evident in the finished film.

There is a wonderful interview with the very erudite John Steiner, a British actor who built a short but spectacular career in Italian exploitation films in the 1970s. Steiner shaved his head to play the slimey Longinus character. Now a real estate agent in England, Steiner's witty comments about the making of the film are worth the price of the DVD set alone.

As time goes by Caligula will continue to be restudied and reassessed. No doubt it will gain in stature but unlike the other Caligula film of cinema legend, the `lost' 1937 I Claudius featuring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Emlyn Williams as Caligula, we have ample material to study and assess thanks to this excellent DVD collection.",1220140800,7,2668,4.995495495495495

637357,4,6303364438,"""Little Boots"" Caligula, masterfully portrayed by Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange""), easily the most degenerate, morally corrupt of all the Ceasars, including the infamous Nero, invites you into his sexually seething, opulently gore-filled palace to witness his uncontolled hubris as he ascends to the ""throne"" of what was once the Republic of Rome.

Vicious, paranoid, petulant, flippant, Caligula destroys all boundaries of morality in his unbridled lust to become a god. Peter O'Toole and Sir John Gielgud add dramatic gravity in short but well-crafted roles as roadblocks in the path of monomania.

This film is definitely not for younger viewers nor persons who object to pornography, demonstrating as it does the broadest range of sexual activity one is likely to see in a film intended for the general public.

For all of that, the lavish sexuality of the film is essential to the depiction of scene and theme, and though ever-present, it is only occasionally gratuitous. This film must rate as the finest film ever made to contain pornography, stylistically, contextually, and thematically.

Despite the visuals, or sometimes because of them, ""Caligula"" is indisputably a morality play for our time. It is repellant and reassuring, and, ultmately, a near-masterpiece of fine art.",1209254400,3,1293,5.3861386138613865
637358,3,6303364438,"The R rating means that the fifty four minutes or so of hardcore is nowhere to be found so nothing can distract you from the film's choppy editing. Scenes jump ahead so abruptly and frequently that it's impossible to be sure what  the hell is going on. This makes a mess of a movie even messier.  With that being said, 'Caligula' is one of the more interesting failures in cinema of the past forty years. The script was written by Gore Vidal but he demanded his name be removed. I'm sure it was historically accurate at depicting the perverse sex and violence rampant in Rome at the time but pornographer Bob Guccione goes overboard  making things more raw and in your face than is appropriate or tolerable. The cast, a who's who of top British talent had no idea that Guccione was going to bastardize the film. Malcolm McDowell is a natural for Caligula since he engages in the same kinds of ultra violence as he did in 'A Clockwork Orange', Helen Mirren is extremely sexy as his wife Caesonia, Peter O' Toole is debauched perfection as Caligula's Uncle Caesar, and  John Gielgud is the psychic Nerva. All of them invest their roles with everything they have but none of them could foresee where this film was headed.'Caligula' the movie is  famous for attempting to be the first Hollywood movie with hardcore mixed throughout. No one talks about the acting, just the sex. It's too bad since the acting is decent. Fortunately for Gielgud and O'Toole their embarrassment is short lived since neither actor makes it past the first half hour. Caligula will do whatever it takes to assume power and this means killing as many people as it takes, including his uncle. After he inherits the throne his next order of business is to find a wife who will produce him an heir.  Caligula isn't too interested in finding a mate since he enjoys sleeping with his sister (Teresa Ann Savoy) too much. He finds a way around this by having a threesome with both women (glimpsed briefly in the trailer). Caligula goes mad with his new power and begins assassinating anyone who opposes him, and raping the wives of his soldiers whom he has sent away on false military campaigns. He anoints himself a God and decides the logical way to eliminate Rome's debt is to force senator's wives into prostitution. He builds an Imperial Brothel where the commoners can come and sleep with his trusted adviser's wives. The set for the Brothel is as outrageous as the concept. A giant ship complete with Roman soldiers as rowers serves as the pleasure palace. This scene is a perfect example of the outrageous grandiosity and extravagant spending that this film degenerated into. This edited version can't come close to telling the full story and shocking you as much as the unrated version but it's kinda fun to see the sets and costumes and laugh at how absurd it all is. Working from a good script and full of great actors this film turned into a legendary bomb that is worth checking out to see what all the fuss was about.",1208736000,3,2996,4.632768361581921

This movie was graphic in every single way imaginable though it definitely captured the decadance of this era. Caligula just got more and more evil as the movie went on and the last scene death scene took the cake.

Theres tons of sex in this. It can go from one extreme to the next in seconds. The parts with the actors I thought were decently acted, then it turns into one big mess. This would have been a lot better if you cut out a lot of the sex, it really went overboard. It was porn and the more and longer they showed the more you get distracted from the storyline and seriousness of the movie. One on hand I liked it because it told a historical story of an evil power hungry leader, on the other hand I didn't because it looked like an excuse to make a porn and show as much of it as possible.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good. I do have to say that at the end you will be happy what happens to Ceasar. Once you see this movie youve seen it all. This goes all out.",1207267200,2,1176,4.126637554585153
637361,5,6303364438,"I first should disclose that I have a strong respect for Tinto Brass and Malcolm McDowell.  Brass has directed a significant number of beautiful and playful Euro-teaser films which are very fun and light, and which are educational to us stodgy Americans who sometimes need some guidance in the art of loosening up.  I have seen most of his movies and have loved them.  Meanwhile, McDowell is a certified genius. Clockwork Orange proved that, and this movie furthers that impression. He possesses a strange and strong mettle, and with those piercing cold blue eyes he is the demon-freak to which other actors can only aspire.  Add to this mix: Gore Vidal, who is really not my cup of tea for a couple of reasons, but who is admittedly a high-order intellect; Peter O'Toole, in fine form here; and Bob Guccione, who had, in his prime, fabulous sensibilities as to what is sexy in a woman.  Finally, add in Caligula himself. You now have the synergistic recipe for a cinematic masterpiece which will endure for generations. Endure? No, actually it will appreciate, it will increase in value over the years. Bold, unprecedented works enjoy that reward from time.

That is exactly what these gentlemen built here.  This movie is so shock-rich and taboo-dense that I think it takes considerable time to assimilate it. It needs time to ferment in your psyche.  When I first saw it ten years ago I was a little shocked and confused by the madness and mayhem.  This time around (last night) I was instead stupefied by all the dream-like beautiful sets, the dynamic performance by Mr. McDowell  (seriously: this guy deserved an Academy Award here), all the scrumptuous females, the haunting music, Tinto Brass's elegant photography.....and much, much more.

Yes, this movie is clearly not for persons under 18, (or preferably under 21 in my opinion), or for people with prudish predilections.  But if you can open your mind to some vivid, and sometimes ugly, displays of outrageous vaingloriousness, you are in for a real treat. The depictions of cruelty are not pretty, but they only highlight the arrays of lavish beauty by way of contrast.  This movie is Kubrickian in scope and haunting mood. I loved it.  Let's not make it more complicated than it really is: It is a Celluloid Masterpiece, with some parts which are hard to watch.  In the end, we are amply rewarded, as this is a film about history, and of historical stature in its own right.",1206921600,6,2438,4.81294964028777
637362,4,6303364438,"Caligula was an interesting film no dought.  So interesting that there was one thing I had to question about it.  If Caligula was that nuts, then bravo to Malcom McDowell!

WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS

It all starts out with Caligula (Played brillainty and not so brillainty by Malcom McDowell) lying under a tree with his lover, who actually happens to be his sister Drusilla (Played by the hot unknown Teresa Ann Savory).  And a note to those who are offended by this, insest wasn't uncommon back then, the Egyptians did it too.  But they didn't know back then that when a brother got a sister pregnant that the baby would be deformed.  But back to the movie.  Drusilla is married to a fat guy, and Caligula wants her all for himself.  But the real trouble isn't the insest going on, it's the fact that the really perverted Tiberius (Played maginificanty by Peter O'Toole), Caligula's adoptive grandfather, is a tyrant.  Caligula goes through certain stages that Tiberius tries to kill him.

Then as the film goes on Tiberius is strangled by Macro.  Later Caligula is crowned emperor of Rome!  Later on he has Macro killed.  Then he must find a wife, since Drusilla is already taken.  He finds the most promiscuos woman in all of Rome, Caesonia (Played by the Oscar winning Helen Murrin).  After he marries Caesonia he gets her pregnant, it turns out to be a girl rather then a boy, and not suprisingly he names her after the true love of his life, Drusilla!

Now for the bad part, Caligula rapes a girl who he wanted to marry originally, talk about humiliation, and he puts his fist up her new husband's butt!  How is that possible?!  Later on he kills her husband and a bunch of sex slaves have sex with his dead body.  Then later on Drusilla dies, and Caligula is crushed, no he didn't have sex with her dead body, he was kissing it, but that's it, they pretty much editied the infamous sex scene when Caligula has sex with his dead sister's body. Then things go from bad to worst.  He starts pimping the senitor's wives, and everyone as we can tell isn't happy about Caligula.  And for those prono lovers and haters, yes people were really that sluty back then, after all Rome was a promicuous sociaty.

Then at the end of the movie, they kill Caligula and his wife and infant daughter.  And to think that his daughter had to suffer for the sins of her father, what a shame!

Well other then that there were some goofs with the movie.

A. Some historical goofs, Caligula married his wife Caesonia only after Drusilla died in real life.  Macro is rumored to have committed suicide, not been beheaded which leaves me to goof number B.

B. When they beheaded Macro it wasn't your average ancient execution, no it was some kind of beheading machine which didn't exist at all back then!  So that part was kind of stupid.

C.  When they smashed Caligula's daughter's head into the cement at the end, it appeared to me that her head was already smashed before it hit the ground, then again it could just be me.

So while there is some truth to the film, it's all just Hollywood to me.  On a positive note, excillent cast, costums, scenery and sex!  The acting was ok, but not very great, Malcom McDowell should have gotten an acadamy award, however it seemed like he tried too hard to act like a villian.  He was good at acting like a nut, but nobody sounds like a villian in real life.  But if I had to chose watching this and watching Waterworld, it would defently be this film!  It's the best flop ever!",1206921600,3,3503,4.494453248811411

637364,3,6303364438,"Despite its plodding plotline, ""Caligula"" excels in its sheer extravagance. There seems no better subject for such a movie than the emperor Caligula, and the movie is a fascinating clash of the excesses of ancient Rome and the excesses of modern Western society. It is so mindnumbingly lavish that one cannot help but enjoy it. Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole and Helen Mirren make excellent performances, which none of them have yet publicly regretted, but it seems their presence is more significant as names on the movie poster than adding any real quality to the movie itself. The true credit of the movie's succeses go to Danilo Donati, who created the sets and costumes (also Fellini's art director), and Bob Guccione, the producer who pushed the limits of the movie's decadence (also founder and publisher of Penthouse, the company that produced ""Caligula""). Gore Vidal's original screenplay is reportedly nearly unrecognizable in this final cut of the movie, which is unsurprising given the unremarkable dialogue and storyline that does little more than fill in space.

637386,3,6303364438,"I remember watching Caligula in the movies many, many years ago and falling in love with the actress that portrays Drusilla, Caligula's sister - Teresa Ann Savoy. The movie, I dare say, is somewhat linear in a bad way. By that I mean, there is no crescendo. No high before the fall. It's just sick humor followed by grotesque deaths, surrounded by sex. In a nutshell, the plot is about this ordinary guy, loosely related to royalty, that suddenly becomes ruler of the known world. Caius Caligula, the adopted son of the Emperor Tiberius Ceaser, fearing he is to be killed by the man who killed his family, strikes first and becomes the new Ceaser in one swift stroke. Young and cocky, he plays with his new power by first taunting, later humulating the Senate and the army in a series of ludricous acts. When his sister Drusilla, the only voice of reason he is willing to listen to dies, he really cuts loose. Seen as having gone mad, Caligula, his wife and child are inevitably killed by roman soldiers in a conspiracy lead by the Senate.

The Imprial Edition is a 3 DVD set that offers two versions of the movie, the normal comercial release and another that would have a corrected editing (text inside comments that the original movie was edited out of what should have been the correct order). There's little difference between the two. There is also an assortment of extra material, including various outtakes, picture galleries and some very intresting interviews both filmed at the time of shooting the movie and recent.

My thoughts regarding the movie is that it fails in it's attempt to portray pagen Rome as it states. I have no problems with the sex and orgies. Sex is part of what we are as people. Part of our way of life, like eating or defecating. Such hang-ups do not distract me. But filming people working naked, mallot in hand breaking rocks is not reality. It's just for show (or shock). This is not real life, simply put. Watching Bob Guccione stating in interview that the main concern was accuracy in portraying paegan Rome is a joke.

It could be suggested, that the movie would probably be less controversal, less sex-explicit and more directed to the story, if Guccione was not involved. Having said that, the movie would certainly not have the sets and costumes, let alone the great actors, without Guccione's financial involvment either. One can only wonder how the real movie, as conceived by either the screenwriter or director could have been. The finished product is neither.

It is probably clear to you by now that this is not a movie directed towards family entertainment. Though I wouldn't call it porn (it fails on that too), it most certainly is adult entertainment, much in the same way as Emmanuele or Story of O.

I would suggest this movie for students of the art of film making. The sets and costumes are gorgeous and very well put together. The filming itself is very well done (choise of angles/camera positioning, lighting, contrasts). Some may find that the image and sound may not be top for today's standards but they are very good just the same. And the main reason why a movie that fails on so many levels is still topic of discussion in a serious way. This movie contains excelent acting!

Malcolm McDowell is brilhant! He is completly convincing and has my utmost admiration for pulling off a very difficult acting part that done wrong, would make the movie fall flat on it's face. He is the main reason why Caligula isn't just a bad porn flick. Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud are as good as you would expect them to be, though they take part only of the first third of the movie. Helen Mirren, so young and so sexy is a treat. She, along with John Steiner who plays Longinus, help Malcom carry the movie the rest of the way. And then there is Teresa Ann Savoy. When she is on the screen, it's hard to notice anything else. She may not be a great actress, but she is convincing enough. And she is just soooo beautiful in this picture!!! A first class boner with a face of an angel and a figure of a Goddess. Pity there is no interview with her included. I hear she is happily married and a mom nowadays. Good for her.

To be truely complete, this so called Imperial Edition should have included Gore Vidal's original screenplay and Tinto Brass' italian edition of the movie (that's right, there's still another version out there hidden somewhere in Italy), which is said to be considerably different from the one that was screened in theatres around the world.

I felt the same way about ""300,"" but like ""300"" I decided to express my thoughts for the record as it were. I usually don't read other customer reviews before I write my own, but I succombed to curiosity & did manage a little peek--then I KNEW i had to say something.

The really negative reviews seem to be from people who were disgusted by the X-rated pornography. Well, I can appreciate that view. It seems to me that the people who are REALLY INTO porn basically have unsatisfactory personal sex lives. Why else would you be drawn to something if you're already getting it on a regular basis? I think people who have a healthy sex life find porn to be inevitably boring. In the case of ""Caligula"" there is an unrelenting plethora of every kind of imaginable sex act in the book, released as a veritable non-stop action stream throughout every inch & foot of this film. So if naughty sex is what you want, that's exactly what you'll get in viewing ""Caligula."" I mean, the human body can be very beautiful,but there is such a thing as overexposure; just as the movie gets to an interesting point dramatically, group sex is thrown in once again & obliterates any real nuance of the scene.

I would say that about 90% of the overall production design is a Fellini ripoff, but without that great director's humanity or humour.

What really amazes me is all the time, talent & obulent spending that went into this picture. I agree that Malcom McDowell turns in a stellar performace as ancient Rome's worst Bad Boy. Good heavens, it's even got a young (and pretty hot cookie) Helen Mirren playing good-turned-bad-girl wife of the crazed Caesar. That's right, HELEN MIRREN! She who played Ayn Rand & Queen Elizabeth. In this movie she starts out as a priestess of Isis, then falls for Caligula, and then is literally changed like a dog to him. I know actors have always been identified with prostituion, but this is taking things a bit too far. Mirren must have tried like hell to gather up all the copies of the film she could get her hands on in order to get rid of the evidence.

I gave the film 2 stars for shock value, costumes & sets.

The only thing I really can't abide about ""Caligula"" is how it slanders Pagan culture in general, and the Cult of Isis in particular--but then I don't think anyone involved took this project too seriously.

There is little of history and much sensationalism here. Malcolm McDowell does his very naughty boy act to a tee. Not much can be said for John Gielgud and Helen Mirren who made bad career decisions by agreeing to be in this sordid little lot.

Though there probably will never be an ""approved"" directors cut, the second disc of this DVD has something approximating Tinto Brass's vision of the film.  However, there are still plenty of obvious editing issues and overall it seems that due to rewrites and some other production issues, even this version is lacking. it's primary difference is that it drops the Bob Guccione ""penthouse"" sequences that feature the most explicit sexual scenes.  Brass's shots are pretty intense, though, and I would still imagine this film would earn an NC-17 rating, even in this form.

There are tons of great extras, among them multiple commentary tracks (on the second disc) trailers and other new interviews in addition to deleted scenes (in their raw form, so it's kind of a bore to watch)  But I'd rather have too many extras than not enough.

The orgies that bounce from scene to scene distract you from the entire purpose of the movie. Why was this even called ""Caligula""? If this dude wanted to make a porn flick then that's what he should've done, and left the historical aspect out of it. I didn't feel educated or enlightened by anything that I saw because this movie has nothing to do with ancient Roman history or anything else that would take more than 2 brain cells to appreciate. It's like watching over 2 hours of sex, sex, sex, and more sex. Don't get me wrong, I love sex, but that's all they showed, and I think to make sex the entire basis of this movie was tired and tacky. I watch porn, and I don't have a problem with sex scenes by any means, but these weren't simulated sex scenes at all. I'm afraid this was indeed the real thing. This movie has every nasty, disgusting and depraved act known to man. This movie portrayed the Romans as nothing more than sick animals who did nothing more but have sex all day. Frankly, I got nothing out of it, and I can't imagine that anybody would get anything out of it besides getting their rocks off. This movie was no holds barred incest, rape, homesexuality, Lesbianism, torture, non-stop orgies, fellatio and degrading human beings. I'm so disappointed in Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Dame Helen Mirren because their talents were wasted on something that was nothing more than meaningless smut.

637488,5,6303364438,"This version is NOT the original R rated theatrical release that was previously released on VHS by Vestron video.  That version contained many alternate angles and scenes and was perhaps the finest edit of CALIGULA ever made.  This present edition is a remasterd version of the 1999 R rated version that uses no alternate angles and is edited from the ""uncut"" version only.  It is an inferior version from the original because it is poorly edited, however it follows the general form of the theatrical R cut.

With all the much deserved hoopla over the IMPERIAL edition of CALIGULA, it is nice to see that Image has taken as much care with the often neglected R rated version as they did with the uncut version.  The film has never looked or sounded better.  I have always loved the ""R"" cut of the film (for one thing you don't have to be embarrased to watch it with your family or more sensitive friends) and I am very grateful that this cut has now been restored to  visual glory.  There are also three theatrical trailers included on the disc.  It comes in a beautiful package with an embossed slip cover.

637489,5,6303364438,"The CALIGULA Blu ray Imperial Edition is identical in content to the DVD edition that I reviewed last year.  There is no exclusive content on this high def release.  To call it high def isn't really correct because I don't suppose CALIGULA is ever going to look too great, even on Bluray. Nevertheless, the Bluray transfer offers a bit of an improvement over the DVD version, especially in the Alternative Version print.  The alternative footage has been re-mastered for this edition so that the footage matches the quality of the rest of the film.  This is a huge improvement over the DVD which left the ""new"" footage faded and dirty.  The colors of CALIGULA have never looked better than they do here although there is still an excessive amount of grain in many scenes due to the condition of the source material.  This edition includes a smaller sized version of the booklet included with the DVD edition.  Sadly, the beautiful fold out packagaing and slipcase are replaced by the cheap standard Blu ray case.  The edition is now on 2 discs instead of three.  If you love CALIGULA or collect the various video releases of this film, then this release is a must have.  It is the best CALIGULA has ever looked (although it is still far from perfect).

DVD REVIEW

This new edition of CALIGULA is entirely superior to any previous video release of the film, in fact, I suspect it probably looks better here than it did in theatres.  Image has spared no expense in this stuning ""imperial"" edition, and it is so lavish and luxurious that it would have no doubt pleased the emperor Caligula himself.  The most important feature of this release is of course how the film looks and sounds.  I've owned every previous release of this film (including the Beta video tape and the LaserDisc) and I truly felt like I was watching the movie for the first time.  CALIGULA is never going to look too sharp and clear, simply because of the way Tinto Brass photographed it, but I think in this edition we now have the film in it's ultimate form.  The colors are bright and vibrant and background details of the awesome sets by Danilo Donati can now be seen for the first time.  Lines of dialogue that I had never been able to make out before now come clearly from my speakers for the first time.  It is simply amazing what Image has done with the prints.  Speaking of which, we now have an entirely new cut of the film and it is a masterwork.  Gone is all of Bob Guccione's hardcore pornography (and lets face it, that is what it was) and instead we are able to see for the first time the beautiful footage that Brass shot for scenes like the Tiberius Grotto and the Bordello ship.  The film also unfolds differently with scenes restored to their intended running order as scripted by Gore Vidal.  The woods sequence no longer opens the film but appears (in an extended form with never before seen footage) in it's proper place in the middle of the film.  I will say that the editing on all of the new footage is a bit rough and it does not appear to have been ""cleaned up"" as much as the rest of the film stock but this is a minor complaint.  /  Still there is so much more to this edition of CALIGULA than just the two cuts of the film.  There are three theatrical trailers that are real treasures.  There are also three marvelous commentary tracks from Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and journalist Ernest Volkman.  These often humorous commentaries alone would be worth the price of the video but there is SO MUCH MORE.  There is a half hour interview with John ""Longinus"" Steiner.  A full half hour interview with Lori Wagner, the actress who played Agripina (or was it Messillina?) in the Guccione porn footage.  Most importantly there is an in depth interview with director Tinto Brass that is fascinating.  AND STILL THERE IS MORE MORE MORE!  How about an hours worth of deleted and extended scenes?  This footage has not been remastered and it is often in rough shape but it is still amazing to see it.  There is also around an hours worth of behind the scenes footage.  The DOCUMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA is imported here from the 20th Anniversary DVD release but this time there are TWO VERSIONS, one long and one short (can you believe it?).  There are also extensive still photo archives that will take you a long time to watch and trust me, these photos are worth looking at and they will show you a lot about how CALIGULA was made.  There are loads of photos of Tinto Brass directing as well as fotos of Gore ""I'm taking my name off this"" Vidal on the set.  As if all this was not enough, you can put the disc in your computer and read not one but two versions of the Gore Vidal screenplay as well as the complete novel based on the screenplay.  There are also photos of the Penthouse Pets who did the porno footage as well as an unintentionally funny interview with Bob Guccione.  Now we all owe a great debt to Bob, without whom there would have been no CALIGULA (at least not as we know it today) but I've gotta say that he comes off as a pretty crazy fellow in the magazine interviews and to here him blathering on interminably about ""art"" and ""excellence"" and trying to appear sophisticated had me doubled over with laughter.  Not surprisingly, no one in the commentaries or interviews has much nice to say about him (Tinto Brass gives him the easiest time I suppose) but if Bob had not decided to take an already risque film and insert some explicit porn into it, I doubt very much whether we would still be sitting around talking about CALIGULA today.  And now we have the best of both worlds because those who love CALIGULA for its porno aspects have disc one and those who love CALIGULA as a historical art film have disc two, and those who just want a cool fast paced sword and sandal kind of thing (or a version you can share with your grandmother) can buy the new R rated release that is sold seperately and also looks and sounds spectacular.  /  I forgot to mention that the imperial edition comes in a high quality slip case and fold out inner keepcase with beautiful artwork of the cast.  Each of the three discs feature a photo of a different cast member, McDowell, Mirren and O'Toole.  Now certainly this is the longest review I ever wrote for Amazon but it is also the most spectacular release I have ever seen of any DVD.

637492,4,6303364438,"This new Imperial 3 disc edition of CALIGULA from Image and Penthouse is an ""everything and the kitchen sink"" affair.  It should be a must buy for fans of the film, and offers two unique ways of viewing the infamous film known mostly for its peversity.

Disc One contains an unrated X-rated version including all the Bob Guccione inserted scenes of somewhat hardcore sex acts.  The editing is a little off as Guccione assembled this cut from what Tinto Brass directed and put some scenes out of order thus blurring the narrative and character development.

Disc Two contains a pre-release cut of the film without the hardcore scenes, and a more logical progression of scenes assembled to depict the order Tinto Brass wanted them in.  It runs 3 minutes shorter, and you'll notice alternate footage in many scenes.  Three commentaries are delivered over this version with Malcolm McDowell on one, Helen Mirren on the second, and Ernest Volkman on the final track.  Each are joined by authors and film critics who help keep the conversation flowing and on topic.  Also included are a dozen cut and alternate takes.

The third disc contains featurettes, interviews, and archival footage from the production.  A 1980 documentary proves interesting and provides more graphic footage.

The transfer is improved, but still looks blurred and lacking in contrast.  The reason for some of this is the movie was shot like a magazine spread with soft focus cameras.  It's never super clear, and there's plenty of grain and digital artifacts to contend with.

This is the best the film has ever looked, and has tons of extra material to wade through.  A dream for collectors, and a nightmare for the detractors.  The film is dispassionate and brutal - depicting every peversity you could imagine and then some.  Costumes and sets are amazing - including a five story machine that decapitates heads in a colisseum.  Breathtaking for all the wrong reasons, CALIGULA is about ego out of control.

637494,3,6303364438,"Tinto Brass' Caligula is a film with balls; both literally and figuratively. Loaded with over-the-top set design and egregious nudity, Caligula is often unfairly brushed off as an expensive porn flick. In fact, what seems agregious to us now might not even be a slight exaggeration as regards the Roman Empire in the early AD's. Apparently, this film is one of the more realistic accounts of the debauchery of the time. Indeed, the marketing does not shy away from this. The tagline read something along the lines of: ""The only film to show the true side of Ancient Rome!"" If the film's content is any indication, I would think so!

Caligula has 'cult' written all over it (as well as other 'c' words). This is not a great film, but it IS a great movie. Perfect to pop in in the middle of the night if you are bored, intoxicated, or both. As far as escapist fare goes, Caligula goes well. With the midnight-show dress-up aficionados, it would be just plain fun. Perhaps even a double feature with Rocky Horror?

The sets are outrageous but that's the point. Malcolm McDowell's acting job is surprisingly good, if a bit over the top (but who said that's a bad thing?). Peter O'Toole puts in a decent (albeit short-lived) performance as Tiberius.

My biggest qualm, however, with Caligula is the editing. The hardcore scenes are more than unnecessary and the fluidity of scenes and scene changes is almost incomprehensible at times. Blame Guccione for this; he locked Brass out of the editing room.

Overall I could not give Caligula anything higher than 3 stars out of 5, although I sometimes wish I could. 4 stars is 'Blow-Up' and 'Dirty Harry' territory, and I would feel uncomfortable having them share the glory with such infamy.

637565,1,6303364438,"Caligula is an utter mess of a film if only for the sole purpose that the possibilities for the concept itself were pretty good ones.  Gaius Caligula Caesar's rise to power and ultimate early fall and assassination is a story worth telling a million times over, especially in the daring form of an X-rated film.  It is a direct warning to the social ills of power in the wrong hands and cultural excess. There seemed to be a superstar lineup for this unique idea.  Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Guilguild are three great actors.  The film is directed by Italy's racy Tinto Brass and produced by the editor of Penthouse Magazine who brought a bunch of his girls to `co-star' when things got too hot for the real actors.  It co-stars an exhibitionist model Theresa Ann Savoy and the lead is played by the insane and undeniable presence of Malcolm McDowell.  So what the hell happened?  Gore Vidal wrote an awful screenplay and Brass seemed to have problems with the writer wanting all of the credit for the film. This conflict itself along with all the other ego issues probably contributed to its failure.  I also think it is entirely possible that all of the focus, costs and discipline were replaced with piles and piles of uncut cocaine.  Seriously though, the set must've been one enormous party and as we see it was at times a real-life orgy and acting became secondary.  The flaws are almost wholly directorial in nature.  I feel for the cast because the guys behind the scenes had no idea what to do so why bother delivering a decent performance?

Anyway, the rumors of Caligula's insanity and the stories that exhibit this were tossed into the picture in spurts and the film follows, and perhaps even sets the standard for, many of the varied cliches applied in shocking the hell out of its audience.  The film stands as a landmark for this alone.  You will not forget Caligula but you may want to forget just how exploitative and stupid it really is.  It's not a movie as much as it is an attempt to hold the title as most disturbing footage ever filmed.  To draw a parallel, I think of the scene were O'Toole's Tiberius is showing Caligula his circus of sex and freaks.  It is almost as if this idea of showing just how indecent and indulgent he has become to Caligula mirrors the intentions of the film itself to it's audience.  I don't believe this is intentional as that would give too many morons too much credit.  I will credit Bob Guccione of Penthouse for adding the hardcore scenes after the film, because let's face it the R-rated version is completely disposable.  You got that?  Don't waste any of your time on that version because everything that the film Caligula sets out to accomplish is on display exclusively on the unrated version.  Guccione probably imagined that his director and writer could inject some artistic merit while he brought his merry band of naked women.  As egotistical as he is, I'm not sure he can be blamed...he kind of did his job.

Allow me to point out a few key scenes and why they are monumentally shameless and disqualify Caligula from being a real movie. At the beginning of the movie we see Caligula dancing around, chasing and flirting with his sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy).  The scene's only purpose is to tease the audience with Savoy's body.  She is hardly dressed and by the end of the scene we get a look between her bum cheeks, and then the title of the film appears and the dramatic score is cued.  Why now?  What about the exit of Savoy's lower gastro-intestinal system represents Caligula as a horrible individual or makes any kind of social commentary at all?  It seemed like kind of a strange place to emphasize the direction of the film, although it sure is consistent with what follows.  Moments later (after naked men break rocks or something) we get even closer and more lingering shots at Savoy's intimate areas as she begins rolling around in bed with her brother.  The film goes on and on like this focusing on different sexual acts and parts of the body, which I guess is all Tinto Brass really does anyway.

Judging from behind the scenes extras with Guccione's ranting about some kind of vision, this film is even more unforgivable and ostentatious.  We see blatant fellatio up close and graphic about four or five times, actual brief penetration twice, a long and completely random girl-on-girl scene, a girl peeing on a dead castrated man, people being impaled, a guy being forced to drink whine and then stabbed in the stomach and several other odd things I probably shouldn't get into (I think I've said quite enough).  All of this in the name of what?  It's a mixture of mindless motives because this film is lost.  It says nothing.

Notice I refused to make comments on historical accuracy.  Firstly, it is hard to accurately portray something two thousand years old.  Secondly, the film is not convincing.  I don't believe for one nanosecond that any of these characters remotely represent the real people from that real era.  Historical commentary can only be made within a compelling context to begin with.  Theoretically, there could've been something to say here and the film is a complete failure in doing so.  I would love to see someone try to take this story on again, if only to create a film that is this controversial in addition to a film that is actually smart.  This notorious movie fails on so many levels.",1178496000,44,5418,4.651945320715037
637566,1,6303364438,"This is one of the worst movies ever made.  It's a shame, because the story of Caligula is actually really interesting, and for the first 20 minutes, this film is actually decent.  This is the part where we see the real actors, like John Gielguld and Peter O'Toole.  They end up getting killed off rather early, and the rest of the film is just one lewd act after lewd act.  Lots of gore, hardcore sex, more gore, etc., etc..  Aside from the aformentioned opening 20 minutes, the rest of the film is badly acted (except for McDowell, who is good at Caligula), badly shot (the camera movements are jerky, and it is poorly lit and framed), and the dialogue is very poor.  This was based on a screenplay by Gore Vidal, but it's rather obvious that Bob Guccione spruced up the hardcore sex angle, and made himself a spokesperson for the first amendment with this film.  While the film should be available and should never be censored (bad taste and crappy filmmaking is not a reason to disregard the first amendment), it doesn't make it art just because the film ""polarises"" people and that it's controversial.  It's a real ordeal to sit through, and it's not erotic at all (porn rarely is).  It's a rather depressing experience, mainly because it's just really bad filmmaking.  I wonder what kind of film would have turned out if they had followed Gore Vidal's screenplay more closely.  If you want to check out something really good about Caligula, rent the British miniseries I, Claudius, which really goes into Caligula's madness and his rule.",1177372800,15,1543,4.698884758364312

From a cinematic perspective this movie is mediocre.. The plot was weak, the dialogue was rediculous at times, the wardrobe looked fake at the beginning (began to look more authentic towards the end) but, the overindulgent immorale atmosphere of this movie made it interesting and believable.

I do wish they would have shown the other characters instead of having the whole movie concentrate on caligula and thats the main weak point of this film. From an artistic angle this movie was good, the real sex scenes added nothing to the movie. The Graphic lesbian scene was a complete waste of time, thats probably something Bob Guccione decided to put in to fullfill his sex scene quota for this the film.

637616,5,6303364438,"Whereas the 97 minute rated edition is absolutely meaningless, the 155 minute un-rated version has a full unity, a full flow of meaning and a deep signification. We see the character of Caligula develop his paranoid schizophrenia into what the world permits and authorizes: a murdering frenzy growing out of a sexual perverse cornucopia of impulses crying for and imposing their satisfaction in the flesh of every one else around. The first thing clearly shown is that this Roman world is based on 80% of slaves. These are not even animals. They are furniture, facilities, commodities, and you can do what you want with them, just as if they were some pieces of un-assorted trash. But the film does not concentrate on these slaves that are just a decor, even a decoration, that can easily spread and sprinkle its blood on the walls or on the floors. The film concentrates on the ""people"" who are free, even at times citizens. Tiberius shows how he picks one soldier of his own guard to play with him by having him forcefully filled with wine and then emptying him by directly puncturing his stomach with a sword. Just out of a caprice or for a transient impulse for sadistic pleasure. Note in those days it was not even sadistic. It was just normal. The Emperor could do what he wanted. Caligula will reach summits and records along that line, even with senators and their wives. He systematically exploited not the minds of people but the bodies of people and there was no end to his pleasure in blood, or any bodily fluid or orifice you could imagine. And when there was no door, he could always carve one with his sword. I must admit the standard death penalty and execution was a real pleasure for the onlookers that could throw oranges at the lively heads jutting out of the ground just before the reaping machine slowly came and cut off those terrorized heads like outgrowing grass. Quite more impressive than any lethal injection. But the film shows another element of that supposedly pagan Rome. Sex was in no way restricted by any rule or law. A daily activity you practiced just the same way as eating or drinking, or should I name more physiological functions, except that you did not need a taster for poison. You just took what you wanted, at any time, in any place, and very often it was all organized or even staged as part of the daily life of everyone. And there again slaves were a commodity, even if everyone could be the toy of their neighbours without being able or willing to protest. Just as they overfed themselves in banquets, even to the point of visiting the vomitarium, they over-consumed the bodies of their surrounding human beings and the men could always use a slave to do what they could not do anymore, and then get rid of the slave for good measure and as the cherry topping the whip-cream of the a la mode pastry. After a while you discover the ambition of the film. We are in 37-41 after Christ. The Christian faith and civilizing influence had still to come to cover up this deeply animal nature of man, though few animals kill for pleasure. But do not believe man has changed. Man has just learned how to hide this deep nature that can come out at any time, particularly in war time or when decency disappears in the name of some absolute rule, be it a moral or religious rule, be it the rule of a dictator or whatever. El Ghraib is a common field of realization of human barbaric impulses that have never been eradicated from man because they just cannot be eradicated. And don't tell me women would be different. These impulses are part of the very soil that nurtures, feeds and breeds the civilized or so they call it education of modern human beings. This film is a remake of sorts of Pasolini's Salo as a big expensive super-show peplum film that justifies excesses, not with the word fascism, but with the word paganism. But where is the difference, where is it different? The name does not matter when you have the same mixture of blood, wine and sperm.

If you want to own this movie, this is the version to have, stay away from everything else. You have to see the film to fully understand and grasp it.

637618,3,6303364438,"I wanted to see what all the controversy was over the making of this film.  Caligula is an interesting movie and, what the filmmakers consider to be, a truthful account of life in Rome.  Some of the scenes seemed to be there for shock value only, but are not as shocking today as when the film was originally made, but still might shock some.  One of the scenes in particular, would still be considered shocking and vulgar because of it's mixture of violence and sex.  The movie drags on a bit, again in order to add scenes for shock value.  If you want to see what life was really like in Rome (perhaps), then this is an alternative depiction from what one normally sees on the History Channel.

637619,2,6303364438,"The version I saw lasted one and a half hours. I guess it must have been seriously chopped down: the blurry scenes suddenly seemed to stop, and then moved on to something completely different. I was reminded of Monty Python. Well, the scenes weren't all that different, just more of the same. Porn is designed to arouse. There was nothing whatsoever arousing about this, and none of the participants seemed particularly aroused either. However, it had something, so I give it an extra star, but I don't know what it was. The wreck of a possibility, I suppose. Very good, stellar cast. O'Toole, Gielgud, McDowell, Mirren are all great actors. The constant puzzle was: What on earth were they doing in this crazy and chaotic mess? Just earning a crust? They all looked a bit puzzled themselves: like, what am I doing here? One did get some kind of a feel of how it must have been to be absolute ruler of the entire known world, to have everyone obey one's slightest whim (another question I kept asking myself: Why did they obey him?), and to have no feeling whatsoever for one's fellow-humans. Living an existence totally without faith or purpose, it was suggested, merely leads to a desire to be quit of the whole rigmarole of absurdity. It became faintly interesting when it was intimated that Caligula actually wanted to die, and in any case he knew he would be killed sooner or later. In terms of return on investment this was one of the oddest ways of spending $25 million (that's what it says on my disc cover) I can imagine. Still, no odder than Caligula's own investment strategy. Actually, come to think of it, the whole thing was trash from start to finish. Also, Caligula was not the worst of the Roman Emperors: there was a later one called Heliogabalus, I think, who went even further than little Bootikins.  What a joke.",1164412800,4,1833,4.64

637622,3,6303364438,"Maybe it helps to be familiar with the history, Art, and literature of the Ancient Rome because ""Caligula"" is surprisingly truthful adaptation of the chapter about Caligula in ""The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars by C. Suetonius Tranquillus, the Roman Historian. If you read the chapter dedicated to Nero, you'll be even more shocked because Nero was always fascinated by his uncle Caligula (he was a son of Caligula's sister Agrippina who later became a wife of Claudius who adopted Nero and made him the heir for the title and the power of Roman Emperor). Anyway, Nero made Caligula his role model and managed to surpass his uncle's' notorious fame.

The movie is ifamous for the plentiful scenes of real sex, including incest, necrophilia, rape, and orgies. The movie also includes quite nasty and gruesome scenes of torture, executions, murders, and humiliations but all of the events have been recorded in the historical documents that still exist.

I don't think of the movie as a masterpiece or even a good movie for all of its 2.5 hours. It actually reminds the life of real Caligula. In his childhood and youth, he was adored by Roman people and especially by the army and he was a promising young man. When he grew up as a heir to the cruel and suspicious Tiberius, he had to hide his feelings and go through many humiliations in order to survive. Shrewd Tiberius said about his adopted grandson that ""never humankind knew the better slave and the worse ruler than Caligula"" and that he was rearing ""a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world.""

When the young man finally received an access to the absolute power it had absolutely corrupted him. It is also known that soon after becoming head of Roman Empire, Caligula suffered an illness and as the result of it, he became incredibly nasty, cruel, and suspicious man who had indulged in the worst acts of debauchery, cruelty, and sadism. The movie follows this pattern. I still think that it is an interesting movie with very good actors.

We don't learn much about why Caligula turned out the way he did, just that he was indeed monstrous. The incestuous relationship between Caligula and his sister Drusilla takes center stage, while various episodes of Caligula's bizarre behavior round out the drama.

The plot isn't particularly compelling, but the acting is fine.  Malcomlm McDowell is sufficiently depraved and creepy, and Peter O'Toole is his usual commanding self.  The film is sumptuous to look at, and the essence of ancient Rome is captured nicely, palaces, togas, orgies and all.  Clearly, the filmakers took great pains (and pleasure) in bringing the sexual depravity to life - in vivid detail.  Lingering close-ups of the male and female anatomy abound.

I really don't like to mix sex with violence in movies because the former is the most natural thing in the world while the latter the most unnatural. Having said that, I consider this movie successful as a biopic. The excesses are intrinsic to the story, though whether they are graphic or implied is another matter. The graphic nature of the movie doesn't bother me, though some of the violence is rather gruesome (castrations, etc.). I am very glad the filmmakers decided to show the excesses graphically because it really drives home just how depraved Caligula was (or at least was purported to have been), giving the film that much more impact. However, some of the sex scenes are unnecessarily long, such as the orgy scene where fellatio is shown to the point of climax. The same effect could have been achieved with just a few seconds of the act shown rather than a few minutes.

There is so much that goes to waste in the movie though - great actors, elaborate set designs, not a bad script..the reason it goes to waste is the weakness of focus in the movie - it seems that the camera is always in the wrong place, the greatest monologues of the film are routinely overshadowed by the other things that are going on in the frame.

637671,5,6303364438,"Definitely a different type of historical drama movie, ""Caligula"" differentiates itself from other movies by holding nothing back in terms of sexuality.  Probably the only historical drama I've seen that consists of actual sex scenes with real bodily fluids and Roman-style orgies; some call it obscene, grotesque, etc, but those opinions go to show how utterly different the times of Ancient Rome were, and the film is unafraid to provide such a generous helping of sex that it is quite literally considered by many an expensive porno.

The violence is not as horrible as you might see in R-rated horror movies (or that grotesque scene in Spiderman2 with Doctor Octopus butchering the surgeons), though with much blood, and one case of castration (not real, don't worry!)

The acting is truly something else.  Malcolm McDowell puts on his best performance I've ever seen as Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus ""Caligula"", and even succeeds in giving Caligula a human face apart from the grotesque portrayals of all the historians who chronicled him (Tacitus and Suetonius).  He truly excels in showing a Caligula who is not necessarily completely mad, but rather an average young man corrupted by extreme wealth, extreme power, and the need to shock and disturb the aristocrats he so detests.  Don't confuse this, he IS quite mad, but he is still human, and has human emotions; love, jealousy, paranoia, fear, hatred.  Peter O'Toole's role as Tiberius is short in regard to the total movie, but it is absolutely convincing, casually trying to kill Caligula while continuing about his facade of treating him as a loved one.

One of the best parts of the movie was when Caligula organized an entire Roman legion on the coast of Italy, said he was going to invade Britain, and had the legionnaires charge, naked, into the water and attack Papyrus plants.  I had a great laugh at that.

Now comes the problems:  It seems to me this film has had a controversial post-production period, in which screenplay writer Gore Vidal attempted to disown the screenplay, porn director Bob Guccione added some pretty pretentious and unnecessary sex scenes which contributed nothing to the movie and brought the momentum to a stand still so we could watch some random girls have sex for some reason known only to him, and some of the scenes appear to have been cut together in the wrong places, as I've read in other reviews.

Personally, it had potential to be absolutely spectacular, with less attention focused on the few random sex scenes, and what felt like a 45 minute sequence of just watching all the men and women (Senators' wives and daughters) having sex on that Roman naval ship in the city was exhausting.  It ceases to be arousing after about five minutes of that damn orgy, and the camera keeps going on and on and on and on for what seems like half the movie (it's much shorter than 45 minutes, but it just FELT that long)

I consider this a classic; one of those movies you absolutely have to see, like Midnight Cowboy, or The Manchurian Candidate, or The Name of the Rose.

Also, this is the ONLY time I have EVER even THOUGHT this, but: This movie is definitely a movie you should NEVER show to ANYONE under the age of 16.

NEVER before have I ever thought about any movie.  But don't feel dishearted--it's not a trashy gore flick like a Tarantino movie or something.  Nor is it a trashy porn with a half-assed plot.  It's a good movie, which shows the full moral scape of Rome, from the debauched aristocratic high life in the Imperial palace, to the squalor on the streets, and Malcolm McDowell's performance is as memorable as his performance in A Clockwork Orange.  If only conservative america weren't so cruel, it could be a genuine classic...",1141516800,10,3746,4.796267496111975

Lots of nakedness.  Lots of lewd sex and promiscuity.  Incest and homosexuality. Pedaphilia and insanity.

This represents the first, and only movie, that I believe uses hardcore/X-rated sexual images as mechanisms to propel the story. When viewing them, you will shake your head in disgust and fascination...

637724,4,6303364438,"If this movie offends and shocks you, it's supposed to. This is not a Walt Disney feel good flick, its a flick about a dark side of human nature told in a realistic fashion. It is not possible to give an accurate view of Caligula and his times, without showing graphic, violent, and explicit material. Caligula was a man out to offend the conservative Rome of his great-grandfather Augustus at best, and completely ridicule and torture and kill at his worst. Ultimately, the Romans did kill him for it.

The movie did an excellent job in a historical context. It was very well researched, and gives a highly useful perspective on this part of Roman society at the time. The primary cast was outstanding and developed their characters exceedingly well. I do disagree with the intimacy of the relationship of Caligula with his sister Drusilla(I think that was something he did for shock value to irritate his grandmother Antonia), but by and large, I think everyone behaved quite on par with the values and context of the time. Better than Gladiator in many ways, which also did an excellent job in a historical(fiction) context.

The costuming and scenery was somewhat garish, but often very realistic. We must remember that the Romans were very concerned with fertility, as underpopulation was a real danger. Genetalia was reflected everywhere, and Priapus was quite an important God. This was a society that was so pragmatic it had a shrine next to a latrine door in Pompeii with Fortuna blessing a man defecating. So again, one must expect things to not be entirely to our flavour if its going to give some sense of truth. Yes, the wigs were something wild based on later Flavian hairstyles, and the Preatorian stuff a bit chinsey, but certainly no worse than many other Hollywood on the Tiber flicks. Same with the film and soundtrack.

Where this movie fell down, like so many others, is when the use of explicitness, or violence, etc, gets in the way of the storyline. Too many times penthouse was allowed to get in the way with pointless sex. The violation at the wedding of Proculus and Livia, and the public birthing of Julia Drusilla (poor Caesonia)would be right on par with what Caligula would do, and causes the disgust it should. The scene that has the Caligula, Drusilla, Caesonia threesome is too long, and the simultaneous back room female duo is absolutely a waste of footage. Some of the activites in the brothel scene really just end in breaking up what was an outstanding moment for understanding the sense of ridiculous, and intersting character development between major characters. Ditto on some of Tiberius' love harem. Really, it is what kept this movie from being a five star. With such a stellar cast and good story, they could have flushed out the character dynamics more, such as Caligula's pride in his daughter, and the restraining influence of Caesonia, and her own far more gracious  hence tragic death. ( I mean really, do you think the woman had a whole lot of choice?)

What always amazes me is that people would find this movie so offensive, and punish it accordingly, yet offer academy awards to Schindler's List and Dances with Wolves-very offensive to me. Both of those films suffer from similar problems in unecesarry/overworked violence or graphic displays, and don't even have the acting quality to back it up. If the scores and film quality were better, they should have been, having been filmed later. They were 3 stars at best.

Over all, a bit unfortunate. I honestly believe the movie had all the makings of a five star great. I still enjoy it, I just fast fowrd through the annoying useless bits. Those who condemn the movie based on explicit content need to stick to Disney or half truths.  Those who are interested in looking at some darker parts in human history, give it a couple of viewings, becuase there is a lot of subtle interplay going on, and you might miss it thanks to unwanted distractions.

I had never seen Caligula before and decided to get this unrated version dvd. I've always read about and heard about and seen movies about governments, kings, queens, monarchs, rulers, emperors, princes, dictators, etc. abusing their power and being unfair to the people they rule over, but this guy takes the cake.

I don't mind the constant nudity or the extreme sex or the cruely barbaric sceenes in this movie because that is the way things were for them. It was part of their everyday life. It was the norm.

This movie doesn't ofend me, what it does is it makes me feel grateful i live in the present day and what a long way we've come from those barbaric times.(and still have a long way to go because there's always room for improvment)

Caligula is definitley not a movie to watch with your mom or dad or grandparent or aunt; i know i'd feel humiliated. I watched it with my spouse and that works. We were able to coment back and forth about it and we realy enjoied it.  Not everyone will though, because of the grafic ""everything"" but i personaly like knowing about and seeing how this young ruler became drunk with power. It is history after all, and knowing about history is what it's all about is it not? So why shouldn't it be told the way it realy hapened?  No one is obligated to watch anything, but those of us who do want to know and see, should be able to!

If the movie hadn't been a real life story then it would've just been another violence and sex film and we have a million of those. Not that that's not fine too, but for the sake of argument in this case this man did exist and was mad with power and i do believe there's enough to go on to conclude that all these goings on did go on.

The Doors - Great movie because it's about the true lives of Jim Morrison and his band. If this movie wasn't a true life story it would just be a junk movie.  Same goes for Sid Vicious(Sex Pistols), In The Realm Of The Senses, etc.

From the second it takes the snarling personal politics of royalty attempting to rule a worldwide empire.

The sets really are superb. Enormous attention to detail and a collection of the world's best set and costume designers make this film a work of art. The actors all put in a fine job, except that O'Toole and McDowell get to overact on more than one occasion, showing the lack of directorial control that bedevils the film.

Forget about historical correctness. Most evidence has been lost (true for most periods in history) and what remains is partial and biased, written by members of the senatorial class whom Caligula attacked. The film is both memorable and convincing, however, which cannot be said about many historical films.

The pornography is a sales device. That is, we are told that Guccione interpolated sex scenes after the film was finished and that this alienated the director, Tinto Brass, who removed his name from the credits. But Tinto is into pornography, and helped organise the final orgy which seems really typical of the free love 70s. The pornography is restricted to one scene, the senatorial brothel, integral to the depiction of Caligula's humiliation of the Senate. Elsewhere it is little more than nudity (and the Romans didn't wear many clothes except on formal occasions) and a couple of flashes of two actresses labia. The brothel scene did have several scenes of fellatio and one insertion, but these scenes were not emphasised; they added to the effect of the scene, and effectively so.

Although the motives of all concerned with the film are reasonably suspect, it did succeed in depicting Roman times, Roman morality and Roman politics in a believable manner. Lack of an integrated directorial style may have caused Caligula to fall short of being a 'great' film, but it is a very interesting failure indeed.

637776,5,6303364438,"Our parameters to define ""crime"" differ completely from its meaning 2 thousand years ago. Caligula and Nero, 2 emperors branded as ""criminals"" by the Christianity, could have been in reality an average product of these violent times.
Remember, the average Romans used to pay for the privilege of citizenship with half of their lives serving in the army and certainly dying in the war. And Rome was in war almost continuously for hundreds of years. I would indeed be surprised if all this would have not had any effect in the emperor's behavior. After all, life and death were nothing under the rule of Rome as well as another civilizations. Somehow life worth nothing even in our time of wars for resources, and I don't know if we, humankind, have learned anything from history.
War and slaughter are truly [...] and I doubt that sex is. Remember that soldier and [...] are the most ancient professions.
But coming back to this movie, I believe that most of the events shown here are true indeed. Sex, death, torture, etc were a normal currency in the Roman court as gladiator fighting and death was normal in the Coliseum's arena. Caligula added his personal ""touch"" to these events: the ""head harvester"" is so original and funny, gee, why didn't I think of this brilliant idea before? Did Mr. Guillotin invented his device based in the harvester? I think Caligula was both mad and smart despite other opinions in contrary. Naming his horse Senator! What a brilliant way to commit his crimes unquestioned by lousy senators. I have reasons to believe that the sex and brutalities portrayed by Tinto Brass were real. And the musical score by Prokopieff reinforced the idea that Caligula's mind was indeed both smart and sick, as it was the society that he ruled.
I recommend this controversial film to everyone over 18 and with an enough open mind to make an objective evaluation about the terrible events that may have occurred thousands of years ago.",1126656000,6,1951,4.809523809523809

637780,1,6303364438,"Maybe in your dreams, Gore Vidal. Most of our dreams, even the ones with the endless tunnels and the abrupt falls off high cliffs, are quite a bit more coherent than CALIGULA.  The title of this review is a direct quote lifted off the hour long `making of' special bundled with this uncut version of the controversial 1979 release.  Now, to qualify everything I've said so far - quoting Vidal is a little unfair.  During the special Penthouse publisher and at least one-time movie producer Bob Guccione always refers to the movie as GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA.  Whatever sweet spring of good feelings the principals enjoyed during the making-of special had apparently soured by the time the movie was released.  Vidal disowned the film prior to release and his credit is the rather clumsy `Adapted from an original screenplay by....'  And `uncut version' is usually called `director's cut,' but here there's no director.  The special identifies someone named Tinto Brass as the director, someone the overhead narrator approvingly characterizes as `sex obsessed.'  By the time the film was released, Brass was no longer director and his screen credit was the meager `Principle photography by.'  As far as I can tell Brass was a soft-porn sleaze-meister of minor accomplishments, his major achievement prior to CALIGULA being something called `Salon Kitty,' a 1976 sexploitation flick about a brothel keeper in Germany during World War II.

  CALIGULA does have its share of heavy hitters.  Malcolm McDowell plays the title character, Peter O'Toole is the disease ridden Tiberius and John Gielgud plays the moral Roman senator Nerva.  Tragically, Gielgud's character dies thirty minutes into the movie, O'Toole's dies about fifteen minutes later and we're left with two more hours of movie.  A lot of the remaining two hours are filled with orgies, punctuated now and then with disgusting scenes of gratuitous violence. The plot fits in there someplace, sometimes, just as long as it doesn't get in the way of the orgies.

 Frankly, this is a mess.  The sets are big and gaudy, but poorly lit and phony looking.  McDowell's Caligula is simply repellent, as are all the other characters after Nerva's death.  The sex is soft core that verges towards the hard stuff now and then.  There are a lot of naked Penthouse Pets in this one, but watching them get it on with each other is no less boring than any other uninspired porn offering.  I wouldn't recommend CALIGULA to any but the curious, and only then as a rental.",1123200000,5,2509,4.96642685851319

Most troublesome aspect of the sex scenes is that they were edited in the same choppy style that MTV uses--except this movie was made before MTV even existed.

Story concerns Caligula's rise to power, his search for a wife, his cruelty, his growing insanity, and his richly deserved end.

Yes, there are many beautiful, all-natural girls in this movie, but as I said, they're filmed so erratically that you never get a feel for their overall appearance.

However, Teresa Ann Savoy, who plays Drusilla, is the most beautiful of all, and her scenes are richly filmed.

Final word, though--save your money.",1123113600,5,650,4.872727272727273
637792,4,6303364438,"What can you say about a film like this - and all 155 minutes of it?  I am surprised that Tinto Brass had his name removed from the outer packaging credits, although it is still on the actual movie itself.  The comparison between this and the heavily cut version speaks for itself.  Chiefly it is the imperial bordello scene where Caligula makes the senators wives available for sex that stands out purely on a sexual level.  To be honest, it is no-holds barred sex: fellatio, cunnilingus and actual sex, as one of the actresses mentioned during the documentary sequence from the DVD menu.  Yes, it happened in Rome and that is the reason for the inclusion of graphic sex.  All that aside, the film does accurately deal with Caligula's life, and portrays the character of this evil emperor well.  Malcolm McDowell is well supported by Helen Mirren, Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole et al.  The darkness of the time comes over with a sense of menace, and this is portrayed well by the opening bars of the soundtrack too.  One earlier reviewer mentioned that most, if not all, the women were very hairy.  Well, considering the film was shot in 1979 when underwear that one might say preferred women to shave their intimate parts was not readily available, if at all, then that comes as no surprise.  For me, I much prefer hairy women anyway.  I would imagine that this version of the film, given its content, would only be available in the UK directly in licensed sex shops, but that is another matter.  If you can take what is served up, then you are in for a gripping, thrilling but rather unnerving evening.",1122681600,3,1607,4.616197183098592
637793,4,6303364438,"This film is worth seeing once to see what all the controversy was about.  When I finished it, I was struck by how the excellent historical narrative was bound together with explicit sex scenes, so I had to research the making of the film.  It seems the ""real actors"" who played the main roles would only do R-rated scenes, so a bunch of porn actors were hired as filler, and you can see the delination.  Sometimes you'll have McDowell, O'Toole, Mirren and the other ""serious actors"" doing an excellent scene, while in the background there is some completely unrelated and distracting hardcore sex going on.  The main storyline was broken up with sex scene interludes, and I found myself wishing they would get back to the story.

My husband is a history buff, so we just used the sex scenes to discuss the action in the rest of the film, and for him to give me history lessons on how well the story of Caligula relates to the historical record.  As it turns out, the ""serious acting"" part is a great movie, one of the best and most cinematically riveting history movies I've seen.

I think anyone looking for pornography is going to be disappointed by the history part, and people wanting to see a movie about real life that is stranger than fiction are going to be disappointed that it keeps getting broken up with graphic sex scenes.  Watch this movie once to see for yourself.

I liked the history part enough that we checked out the BBC series ""I, Claudius"" next, but the acting in that is wooden and very slow.  It doesn't compare to the terrific acting in Caligula.",1122163200,9,1572,4.542553191489362

The first viewing was difficult due to unexpected placements of extremely graphic violence, torture and just disturbing scenes. Running 155 minutes it also seemed to drag at parts. The sex scenes were nothing special. All the women are incredibly hairy, this taking away from the erotic elements - I don't find hair jungles attractive. As for the plot it basically highlights the short 3 year reign of Caligula before his assination. The whole purpose of this film is showcase the sick and perverse acts he commited and encouraged during his ruling of Rome. If you like roman history and can sit through 2+ hours of perversions on screen, go ahead and see this now.

637795,1,6303364438,"I happen to have taken up an interest in learning from the historical and biblical accounts of the Roman Empire...be it via books or film. The earliest and best of  on-screen portrayals of Caligula were found in movies such as the Robe, Demetrius and the Gladiators(Robe 2), and A.D.(Anno Domini, Jesus of Nazareth 2), in either case, you'll find a classical(by that I mean accurate yet restricted)approach to the person of Gaius Caligula(ie, tyrant,sex maniac,self-declared god, psychopath, paranoid schizo, and once who would have hallucinations or delusions of seeing the goddess Isis or/and Diana running through his courts. However, when it comes to CALIGULA, I have to admit that after months of curiousities about purchasing the so-called ""most controversial film of the 20th century,"" I gave in just yesterday and purchased it from the local media Play, watched the movie, and my impression was as follows: the movie starts with Caligula chasing his sister around half naked in the woods and getting his freak on, declares himself a god in the opening credits(along with the flashing of a passage from the Gospel of Mark), Tiberius has orgies, Caligula dances, more orgies, Tiberius gets murdered, more orgies, more murders, more paranoia, more orgies, rape, decapitations, porstituton, Caligula's sis dies from fever, the senate gets fed up with his antics, and BAM, from out of nowhere he's assassinated and speared to pieces by Roman guards. No set, no plot, and no sense. For a better, more entertaining portrayal of Caligula, I strongly recommend the movies I'd mentioned earlier. But if you're expecting to see an epic of Ben-Hur, King of Kings, Robe proportions...I SOLD THE DVD IN THE SAME DAY. You won't learn a thing about Caligula's reign...it's all one big porno and he gets killed. Save your money and read a history book for a better picture.

Those words could just have easily been spoken by Lucifer, the ultimate prideful rebel. And in effect, by proxy, they were. as the Satanic spirit is repleat throughout this figure. They were spoken by the namesake of this magnificent historical erotic docu-drama. The original intent of this production was to present the most accurate and realistic portrayal of the events under the Caligulan reign.

There is plenty of fair warning in the beginning, that the subject mater may offend and disturb, so no-one need complain about subjecting themselves to the utterly opulent decadence herein. Truly, Rome in all of its glory. Much controversy has followed this film ever since its pre-production, filmed on location in Rome, Italy. Rumors, of orgies, incest, bestiality, extreme cruelty, blood and gore, followed this film since the start - all of which is most assuredly does contain.

The DVD includes a revealing ""making of"" documentary, which proves to be of great interest with the forboding narrator, with interview inclusions of Bob Guccione {Penthouse publisher and iconoclast, whose scrumptuous 'pets' adorn the film throughout}. Sir John Gielgood {a classic actor of the first callibre}, Peter O'Toole {elite actor who plays Caesar Tiberius}, among others. Here and there, one notices some excised scenes previously unavailable in the widely released form, as it may have proved too extreme for American censors of the time, although I Am sure the European release included them in full.

The cinematography remains some of the best this writer has seen, before its time in the forthcoming Daemonocracy, as The Age of Fire enters the next phase, films rated ""X"" would be presented in the same theatres as those with an ""R"" or ""PG"" rating, with proper documentation submitted by individuals for their viewing. The sets are marvellous, displaying veritable temples of the flesh for the indulgent rewards of those who enter its chambers.

Kettle drums slowly pound monotonously within the echoing halls of pleasure and ecstasy, joined with a chorus of blissful moans and beautifully undulating bodies, amidst the sweet scents of exotic incenses , all under the lustful gaze of Neptune, Venus, and others gods and goddesses of the Roman pantheon. Deja-Vu, to be sure.

Caesar Tiberius must choose a successor. He invites young and naive Caligula to the palace, where he is introduced to some of the elements of betrayal and deceit, and witnesses a justified evisceration as the result of one guard's improper enebriation.

The Palace is filled with beauty in both the occupants and their surroundings. Adorned in horned helmets, satyres thrust into eager nymphs who hungrily take the phallii deep into themselves, filled with pleasure. They swing around upon ornate, vine-decorated wreath-like swings, happily straddling phallic attachments in lascivious rapport.

Caligula strikes a deal with his right-hand man at the time, named Magnus, a Roman soldier, to kill Tiberius and take the throne. Tiberius is subsequently strangled, and Caligula comes into possession of The Emperor's Ring, which he wields with pride and power. Caligula rises to rulership, together with his sister and lover, becoming increasingly more imbalanced, self-destructively, excessively selfish, and indiscriminate in his proclamations. One telling moment was when he spied a virginal couple attending one of his arena events - this one, a remarkable spectacle which employs an elaborate wall-like beheading apparatus, which swings its propeller-like blades along the ground, where prisoners have been buried up to their necks, then razed in decapitation. Caligula wonders if the girl is really a virgin. He commands them to come to him in his secret chambres, where he taunts the man, a soldier, by the way, and devirginizes his fianc' before his traumatized eyes. In a surprising twist, he commands the man to bend over, wherein he thrusts his fist, ring and all - into his rectum. - he no longer is a ""virgin"" either. He is later slowly stabbed to death and urinated upon in an effort to divulge the sensation of dying, as Caligula attempted to find out, with Sir John Gielgood's character earlier on, whom he drowned when he determined he was lying.

In another scene, youths masturbate into golden bowls providing a facial for a noblewoman. A veritable protein-filled youth lotion which is the progeneration of life.

One night, Caligula decides to sleep with a horse. It is rather humorous, as the next scene shows them in bed together, sans a cigarette!

In still another scene, Caligula dons the ceremonial vestments of the Priestesses of Isis, and mingles in with them in the chamber of a sacred pool, where he selects the most promiscuous woman in the kingdom to be his wife {probably as a test to see if she will remain faithful}, who subsequently births his heir, a daughter, whom he insists on calling his son {as such the importance placed on male heirs at the time}. Eventually, Caligula goes insane upon the death of his sister / lover from the fever, which is the turning point to more of his crueller exploits, including hosting an orgy which includes the Senate's {the so-called ""natural enemy of the Emperor""} wives and sons, which I believe is what eventually does him in. Also, in his terrible grief, he temporarily lowers himself to the level of the peasants, roaming incognito amongst them, becoming enraged when when he witnesses a troupe of acrobats mocking he and his wife through effigy, thus disrupting their sacrilegious display, which lands him in a filthy jail, wherein he develops a strange affinity for the common folk therein. Upon his return to The Throne, he has the acrobats arrested and executed.

In the end, the tyrannical Caligula is assassinated in Egypt by one of his own Generals, as seems to the typical modus-operandi of the Caesars.

Overall, Caligula is a remarkable piece of underground paganography that has to be seen to be believed, and therefore, appreciated.",1113436800,24,6219,5.0852941176470585

Of course, you've probably heard about the shameless porn scenes. Well, it's true and not true. There are a lot of sex acts but I wouldn't call it a porn movie. Yes, if naked bodies shock you, don't try to watch it. But it's not about sex. There is a much bigger message.

The Roman life 2000 years ago in many aspects was very similar to our life now. And sometimes we think we can understand those people. But then some striking differences pop up. And it's quite an experience to try to compare life then and now. What is similar and what is different? Are the people the same as they used to be? What moral principles have changed for 2000 years?

It is all pure fantasy, a la Tinto Brass (and Guccione), and therefore there is always a sense of disconnect between viewer and character(s).  If one of the main themes was to show man's inhumanity to man, then the film fails.  Still, everyone should see it once.  Caligula  would make a GREAT remake,  ...too bad Kubrick is gone.

After it's over you can strip down naked, march around with your arm strecthed out with the thumbs up, and see what happens.

By far the best scene is the Roman orgy with the senator's wives. Holy moly for only 5 gold coins you could do whatever you wanted to them.

The 'wedding gift' from the emporer is also pure lunacy. To not only have your new bride, but you yourself lose your virginity to the emporer is a night you'd never forget. I just hope he washed his ring when he was done.

On second viewing, I found it to be a very realistic approach to potraying Ceasar-Era Rome.  It wasn't civilized; it wasn't Athens.  It was Rome, filled with political intrigue, deceit and Emperors with near dictatorial power.  I've read Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars, and the potrayals of both Tiberius and Gaius Caligula are accurate.  Tiberius did keep a harem of young boys and girls to indulge his perverse sexual fantasies, he did have a building full of copulating couples, this was all accurate in the film, and I think the gritty way it was made in the film is correct; you are meant to be shocked and perhaps outraged at his behavior.

The same goes for the Title character, Caligula.  If Tiberius was bad, Caligula was worse.  From killing Tiberius to violating bride and groom at a wedding to having people killed at his whim, he was certainly outrageous.  His over-the-top performance in this film was truly...fun...to watch, and the same goes with the rest of the cast, the acting is simply superb.

About the only half-OK parts of the film are the sex and nudity, a few of which are really twisted and difficult to watch (e.g. Caligula's intrusion into a wedding party during which he violates both bride and groom).

It has little relevance to the history of the time, which I was hoping to see, and is a nightmare of gaudy plastic and plaster sets, and when clothed, garish costuming.

It's astounding that actors like John Gielgud would sully their careers with a trashy project like this; Peter O'Toole looks like a decomposing corpse as Tiberius Caesar, as he frolics in a pool with his naked ""fishies"", and Malcolm McDowell is perhaps the worst of all. His Caligula is played like an evil drag queen (this is one of those films where nasty and nelly are equated) and since he is on screen for a large portion of the film, it gets really tiresome.
As for eroticism, it is lifeless and pathetic...titillating perhaps for the Bob Guccione (who produced this rotting garbage) types of the world.

637858,2,6303364438,"Lesser ecstasy, the way of all flesh, this is Caligula. Perverse, almost religious. Pretentious production overblowing the proportions of its intent, the result could have been far more meritorious and grandiose. Gore Vidal, Bob Guccione, and Tinto Brass, gathered for the ultimate erotic film ever shown in common Theaters, the result as a cinematographic triumph, not happening, but it is still shocking. The only real statement of Caligula is to have dared shown the pre-Christian Roman Empire in its entire decadent life of rotten flesh, unlimited sex, clean, filthy, orgiastic parties of special magnificence, and cut-throat acts of bestial and deprave human willing, it is great and beautiful.

Caligula stands somewhere in the dominions of the erotic and the graphic of pornography. Tinto Brass narrates the lousy story of Emperor Gaius Germanicus Caesar, better know as Caligula, a script by Oscar Winner writer Gore Vidal, whose intentions to tell the fall from sanity and common sense into the Necromancies of power and the corruption of its touch, corrupted by the crown and its seasons, where frustrated by Director Tinto Brass, this project was to much for him, lacking the necessary vision and talent for an accurate direction, the other layer of bad sense was indeed its producer, Bob Guccione, at least Guccione had the daring eye to show the explicit even more explicit, but also lacking the talent for a better understanding of the story, it was about sex for him since the beginning. About the Historic Caligula, the main ancient reference to the megalomaniac character (besides the vague anecdotal writings), is: Suet. Gaius; Dio 59; Philo In Flaccum and Legatio ad Gaium; Jos. AJ 19.1-211. Tacitus's account of the reign is lost. However, he makes occasional references to Gaius in the extant portions of his works, as does Seneca. The later sources inherited a tradition about Gaius that can be shown to be biased and exaggerated. Besides these literary sources, inscriptions and coins also offer some information. So you can't be factually loyal to the Historic truth, and that gives you license to do pretty much anything you want, in this matter, the film can't be criticized concerning the story of its protagonist. Tinto Brass direction is un-personal and cold, a succession of images that moves schematically towards a much predictable ending. The first 30 minutes are composed in an inappropriate Theater style, which is un-intentionally enhanced by the Theatrical production design of the settings, it seems that Tinto Brass caught a better sense of pace and composition after shooting those scenes, and some how manage a more dynamic narration, even so, without any real soul. Bob Guccione shoot additional material to be added in the sex scenes, but the mediocre editing felt short inserting those scenes in a more imperceptible way.

Over the years I heard a lot of stories about the graphic and out daring ways of Caligula's sex scenes, so I expected to see real hard core images, stories that went from vast orgies, to a woman having sex with a horse, a man having intercourse with a duck, and a very long etc of perversities. So the movie didn't really shock me as I expected. Of course, if you are a very conservative or repressed person, the film will not only shock you, it will insult your moral values, Pastors, loyal Christians, and of course, Republicans, will also be severely insulted by the sex scenes, any way, the movie comes anticipated with an infamous fame, you can't make no mistakes, if you buy or rent it, don't blame the film for its controversial content, blame your self for being naive.

Caligula's sex content is way out dare from any previous movie that calls it self an erotic film, the difference is that Caligula does have pornographic inserts on it (plain shots of both sex's genitalia, oral sex, copulations, masturbation, etc). But the film can't be categorized as a porn flick. Pornographic movies intention is to show continuous explicit sex scenes without any real plot, always pushing for as many sex scenes as possible, Caligula doesn't have this, even though the story is poor, the sex is very well inserted in the life of the Roman Empire, expanding its plot with its main characters concerning the madness and greed for power, there is not a continuous pushing for exposure of hard core sex all over the film (at least not in the way of porn flicks), here lies the charm of the film, the sex taken in the social environment of the Roman Empire is an splendid depict of the period, every shot of sex intercourse is for free, but to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way.

The performances of the Cast are both poor and flat. Malcolm McDowell wasn't enough for the role, his malignant looks felt short, an opportunity much dismissed. The Great Peter O'toole is barely O.K. but without any resembles to his masterful and classical performances. Helen Mirren and John Gielgud are completely wasted, the rest aren't really actors to be considered so.

The Woman are just beautiful, Teresa Ann Savoy (Julia Drusilla), Helen Mirren (in her younger years), as Caesonia, the Penthouse Pets are breathtaking, a real feast for the eye.

The photography is awful, boring colors and easy lighting, a mayor waste if you take into consideration the significant budget of the film. A good score does some goods for the film (including music by Sergei Prokofiev). Bad costume design and pretentious setting design surely captures the mood of the Roman Empire, but a fake Roman Empire. Caligula was released in 1980, at the very end of the 70's sex freedom, and just before Ronald Regan's repressed republican policies of censorship. Right now Caligula could not be shown in common Theaters in the U.S.A in its un-rated version. If it where a high pack action thriller full of blood, there will be no problem at all.

The DVD is O.K., the transferring can't be called bad, but a better work could have been attained, the 5.1 Dolby Digital is good, but with a poor distribution of the sounds. The Making Of Documentary is excellent and very complete (also un-rated).

So, even with all the bad elements in it, Caligula is brave and highly entertaining, and Cinema always needs brave and different projects to sustain it self. You can call it a piece of sh..., or a masterpiece, it doesn't matter, Caligula, Fellini Satyricon (oviously emulated by the producers of Caligula), and Gladiator are the only Roman films I'll see during Holy Weekend.",1092528000,12,6504,4.933333333333334

Not surprising if you see that Tinto Brass' only contribution to film and direction is pornographic in nature. Instead, history was used as a flimsy backdrop for a purely modern pornographic film. An utterly tasteless film in which no amount of acting talent could possibly save from its horrible screenplay, mediocre direction, and tasteless emphasis on sex.

The film covers the reign of Caligula, the Roman emperor who reigned for only 3 short years after succeeding Tiberius. The Roman emperor who would become infamous for his demented cruelty and sexual perversions. Although it would be impossible to remove sex or violence from a film about Caligula, the screenplay in this film mostly emphasizes his sexual exploits to bring its Penthouse tramps to the forefront. The acting is clearly of secondary importance in the film as demonstrated by measely dialogues the lines of which were mostly extracted from the anecdotal history of Suetonius. There's no real character development for any of the personnages: the dialogue is simply used to foreshadow or introduce another risque sex scene. The sexual scenes are so pervasive that it isn't worth seeing the rated version because it has nothing to show. Absent the erotic scenes, the backdrops are cheap and not even historically faithful. If the collective talents of Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren can't make a film any good then it must really be very bad as the latter are some of the finest theatrical actors.

Avoid this film at all costs unless you want to see it for its pornographic quality (an oximoron in my book.) The narrowly focused 'skills' in directing plotless pornography takes are simply not a measure of film competence in directing narrative (i.e. plot-driven) film. The minimal narrative in pornography serves only to set a fantasy scene that will erotically arouse its audience as opposed to continuing an actual story. The result of Brass applying such limited filming and narrative techniques to a historical drama is obvious. I can just imagine his direction at work in this film: 'Moan louder! Good! Bite your lip! That's it! Remember you are are a subservient Roman slave complying to your powerful emperor's rectitude! Uhh... O'Toole and you other guys just keep doing whatever it is you're doing while I work with the actors here!"" Seriously now, the one and only great cinematic performance of Caligula is the one by John Hurt in the BBC production of 'I, Claudius.' Caligula is a very difficult role to play and John Hurt's rendition couldn't be more demonically sociopathic or cruelly mischevious than what I imagine seeing when reading Suetonius. Even more credit to him is that he delivered an outstanding performance without the benefit of being the central character or having a lavish production at his disposal.",1092009600,,3262,5.061338289962825

637861,1,6303364438,"Every fan of movies should be forced to watch Caligula as an ascetic exercise at least once.  For only in discovering how bad cinema can be are we able to fully appreciate how good it can be.  And the good news is that the film has a message- absolute power corrupts absolutely!  That is the end of the good news.
As an historical drama, Caligula completely fails to capture any sense of time and place.  While some of the scenes depicted (such as the Emperor Tiberius swimming with his ""little fishes"") are based on historical sources, it seems as though it could have taken place on Mars.  The sets and costumes are incredibly garish or silly, sacrificing any suspension of disbelief.  The camera work is amateurish- it zips around, losing its subject, and often delivering an unclear picture due to what seems to be inadequate lighting or a failure to focus on the subject.  The picture is grainy throughout and tough on the eyes.
As an ""artistic"" hard core porno flick, Caligula is boring and not the slightest bit titillating.  The sexuality is displayed between frequent and extremely gruesome acts of violence (the multitude of which I will not catalogue here, suffice it to say the movie should not be watched while eating).  Also, when trying to advance the plot (if Caligula has one), the hard core scenes are exasperating in their ability to delay the progression and break down whatever narrative quality the film might have had.
Other reviews speak adequately as to the story of how this train wreck of a movie occurred, so I won't go into it.  I can suggest, however, that you will likely never see such an A-list cast in such an awful movie ever again.  The included documentary is laughable- Guccione is really convinced he is making a truly important film, and the casting reflects that.
Now, the only dramatic alternative I know of to Caligula that covers the same period is ""I, Claudius"".  While Claudius runs 668 minutes and Caligula runs 155, I can guarantee you that the latter seems to go on much longer; forever, in fact.  You emerge from viewing it wondering what in the world you just watched, and whether or not viewing a film can actually make you a less noble person.

There's also plenty of graphic nudity and sex, which can be a bit off-putting, especially when it higlights Emperor Caligula's somewhat outr tastes. Nowadays, he might be classified as a sexual predator and/or a serial rapist.
This film is not intended to be historically accurate (which is virtually impossible, anyway*), and lives up to its' billing as the first $15 million porno film ever. Watch it if you dare, but don't say I didn't warn you!

It's a psychological drama and a classic tragedy, and I'm not just saying that to seem hip by trying to elevate something obviously crass. The key point in this movie is that Caligula is not insane. His father, Tiberius, does seem to have gone insane from syphilis or something similiar, with those blotches on his face, but all of Caligula's behavior is intentional, as when he baits the senate and someone accusses him of being mad; he answer something like 'I know what I'm doing. I just don't know what _else_ I can do to provoke them.' All of his behavior is psychologically realistic, and that's what makes the movie so interesting, in light of how absurd and grotesque his behavior is. It does more than explain him; it almost succeeds in making him sympathetic. As for these charges of pornography, I don't think I've ever been _less_ turned on by a movie. The images are presented in such a way that there's really nothing pornographic about them. I mean, some people might theoretically be aroused by the sight of a guy fondling the naked body of his dead sister, but I think most people would instead see it for the extremely _disturbing_ image it was meant to be.",1087948800,4,1453,4.635658914728682
637905,3,6303364438,"I had seen this movie before in what I had believed to be the uncut, original version.  I was mistaken.  In the version I saw years ago, there was lots of nudity and a few brief shots of fellatio.  This version has long, drawn-out scenes of pure pornography.  It's not that I mind the sex; Taken on their own, the sex scenes are all beautifully done and, for the most part, fairly erotic (for this kind of thing.)  It's just that none of these scenes are integrated into the rest of the film.  They all come across as utterly gratuitous and ultimately, silly.  Now, if they had just gotten Helen Mirren to disrobe, that would have been a whole other story.
The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the set design.  There are some elaborate set pieces that are simply outrageous - the moving wall of rotating blades is a sight to behold, as is the giant mock-boat contructed to house Caligula's government brothel.
The next best part of this movie is scratching your head in wonder at its cast.  Peter O'Toole?!  John Gielgud?!  Helen Mirren?!  How in the name of Captin Crunch did these people end up in this epic porno flick?

637907,3,6303364438,"I wish I liked Caligula. It could have been so much: with talented actors, beautiful extras, a no-holds-barred approach shared by an intellectual screenwriter and an uninhibited director, it sounds like a blueprint for an brutally honest and emotionally strenuous film. And maybe it was at the time, but as one of the millions of movie viewers who don't remember the 70's, who never had limits on the amount of sex and violence presented as entertainment (except, for better or worse, our parents), Caligula is not very shocking at all. It's terrible to admit being desensitized, but anyone who has ever watched both a porn movie and a single episode of any network cop drama can handle this.
It is important to watch the ""Making of Caligula"" feature with the DVD, as it explains everything that went into making the film. In many ways, this short film is more interesting than the movie itself. It's kind of sad, really, to see how Gore Vidal thought the movie would change the history of cinema and how much research and effort and money went into creating a Rome that ultimately looks like a porno movie but acts like a morality epic. If anything, it's evidence of the efforts in the 1970's to bring porn into mainstream cinema, of the time right before AIDS was discovered. It belongs on a shelf next to ""Deep Throat.""
Caligula is a reasonably good movie about how excess brings the death of morality. But so many other movies have been made which better explore this theme in equally provocative ways. ...",1079827200,5,1510,4.723484848484849

Yes there are a lot of sick parts in this film, but don't say this isn't a good movie. Everything in this movie is almost an exact portrayal of that time.

637910,5,6303364438,"A few years back there was quite a controversy over some shot-on-video garbage called 'Baise Moi' solely on it's inclusion of hardcore pornography (I have a bootleg and believe me it's a mere 30 secs over the total running time of the film). A lot of sheltered mainstream viewers were confused and bewildered, but there was nothing original or daring about 'Baise Moi'. Needless to say all the attention cast a great spotlight on an otherwise worthless film and the people responsible for it made off like bandits. Anyone who was ""shocked"" by 'Baise Moi' should definitely stay away from Caligula, which makes the overhyped 'Baise Moi' look PG-13 by comparison!
Towards the end of the 70's there was a vibe that pornography would be absorbed into mainstream movies. Not too far fetched considering then X-rated films such as 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Clockwork Orange' were winning awards and critical acclaim, also in Europe there were plenty of horror/exploitation films that blended full blown pornography into the genre for example Joe D'amato's 'Emanuelle in America' 'Erotic Night of the Living Dead' 'Porno Holocaust', Jess Franco's 'Female Vampire' 'Doriana Grey', Jean Rollin had put out a few and there was a fantastic little film called 'Thriller:a Cruel Picture' which should be out on DVD early this year! With this in mind Bob Guccione got the rights to a Gore Vidal screen play, hired top actors Malcom McDowell, Peter O'Tool and Helen Mirren then enlisted the services of Italian director Tinto Brass (who later removed his name after Guccione shot extra scenes) to create the most expensive porno in history.
I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed Caligula and genuinely feel it's a great film! A lot of people nit pick small historic anomalies or make unfounded blanket statements such as ""the acting was bad"" or ""the story was pointless"" to hide the fact that their own prudish tastes and inhibitions won't allow them to accept Caligula as the daring and unique piece of film making that it is. Now I respect the opinions of people who say Caligula is too graphic for them or there were scenes which offended them as make no mistake about it there are scenes in this film which will alienate anyone who isn't familiar with quite sordid pornography. Plenty of intelligent viewers will surely consider this film to be in bad taste, which is perfectly acceptable. However ignore intellectual posers who would have you believe this film is worthless simply because they are not big enough to say ""personally I did not like it"". Too many small minded people have the out dated view that all pornography is evil and while it's acceptable that not everybody is into porn, please do take a look where this book burning mentality leads before you endorse the ideals of censorship.
If you want to accuse this film of being historically inaccurate, pointless, badly directed and poorly acted, you should go write reviews for 'Titanic' 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Moulin Rouge' first. Caligula has more style and resonance than all of those films put together. For better or worse Caligula would surely get a more powerful reaction from an audience than any film you could see in the cinema today. Let's face it Hollywood has not produced anything vaguely original or challenging in more than a decade.
Another thing which irritates me is all these haters who attack Teresa Ann Savoy for her ""bad acting"". I feel she is a fine actress, so what if she doesn't mind taking her clothes off. Julia Roberts today gets the fattest paychecks for a female actor and she has done nothing but star in meaningless garbage and is incapable of playing anything but the same shallow character. Savoy is cool, sexy and has great expressiveness. Check out her other Tino Brass film 'Salon Kitty'.
Image Entertainment's DVD is good, but for those who are true fans of this film you may want to check out the remastered 2-disc French release available from amazon France. For those who are prudish or sensitive viewers, give Caligula a miss altogether, theres a new 'Troy' movie coming out with Brad Pitt which would better suite you.

Anyone reading virtually any of the histories of the ancient world must come away wondering why authors continually sanitize the facts of life in that age.
It seems that only the ancient historians had the integrity to tell the truth and to attempt to characterize life in those times. Seutonius is one who immediately comes to mind.
The film does not attempt to reconstruct all of what it was like to live among the upper classes in Rome but it does attempt to make up for the sanitization of history which we are forced to accept from current historians.
For that reason, I believe this is a must see film.",1062460800,15,771,4.553956834532374

When you have that urge to view porn, Caligula is not the first film you rent......too much plot. It has many hardcore sex scenes, but this was all part of an enormous failed experiment: To bring porn scenes to legitimate film. It didn't work, this film is a disaster. But because of this, the film is very entertaining. The first time you see it you won't believe what you're watching. You'll be asking yourself, ""How?"", ""Why?"", etc. Regardless if you love it or hate it, you'll sit through the entire two and and half hours of it just out of morbid curiosity and bewilderment. The same impulse that makes you slow down as you drive past an accident on the highway. I'm not quite sure what Gore Vidal was thinking here; Wouldn't you think that if you got Bob Guccione and Tinto Brass involved in your film that it would be overflowing with sleaze? Gore can't be that dumb! In the documentary it's hilarious to watch him talk about the historical and philosophical importance of the movie. I bet he feels like a total schmuck and totally ashamed now when he thinks back on that. I'd love to ask him about it. The film tries to be accurate and take itself seriously as a drama, but lets cut through ... here; Guccione was merely using this as a way to push his sleaze into the mainstream and become an ""innovative genius"" in the public's eye. The sex scenes are very sleazy and disgusting because they're usually sandwiched between(or during) scenes of graphic violence, making them devoid of any kind of erotic value. I love showing or lending this movie to unsuspecting friends, coworkers, family, just to get their reaction. There will never be another movie like Caligula....ever.

637944,5,6303364438,"Caligula is a truly hot film!  I saw it years ago on VHS and then in a theatrical release about four years ago.

This is not a truly historical film, nor yet is it strictly speaking a sex film or ""porno"".  Much of the film is based on actual history, but it is not pure history. I would tend to label it as a spectacle.  There is plenty of nudity, to be sure.  There is some explicit sex. It is by all accounts oddball.  There is drama and some history thrown in, but don't expect a true to life blow by blow account of the life of Caligula.

When you see it, you are not going to see a real life portrayal of ancient Rome.  It is more like a fantasy based on ancient Roman themes.  If you are looking for stricly historical film about Emperor Caligula, then the series ""I Claudius"" would be more of a better treatment.

Watching the film is like watching a dream -- like one is entering the mind of the mad man.  It is often highly erotic filled with the rich texture of nude human flesh and sexuality and at other times horrifically violent, cruel, and disturbing.  Some scenes, including a mutilation scene are hard to take, but this does not detract from the overall richness. It is not your ordinary breed of film.  (Another similar film with plenty of nudity but without sex is ""Prospero's Books"".)

If you like unusual films with a lot of nudity, sex, exotic scenery and a bit of drama and history thrown in, then Caligula is for you.  But if you are put off by nudity, explicit sex, violence and the unusual, then you will hate it.",1054166400,5,1539,4.27681660899654
637945,3,6303364438,"Any book or film purporting to examine the life of the Roman Emperor Gaius (Caligula) must necessarily look deep into a tormented soul. Caligula (which means ""Little Boots,"" a nickname the future emperor picked up in the army camp of his famous father Germanicus) ruled for a mere four years, from 37 to 41 AD, but managed to alienate almost every member of the Roman government during that time. What we do know about Caligula, which is actually very little, comes from Suetonius, a historian in the employ of the Emperor Hadrian nearly 100 years after Caligula's reign. Suetonius paints a picture of an insane tyrant, a power mad figure that murdered, tortured, tormented, and flaunted his unlimited power over the Roman Empire until his brutal assassination. Unfortunately, the historian Tacitus's treatment of Caligula's reign was lost to the ages long ago, leaving us with little else to go on concerning this interesting man from eons ago.
In the 1970's, Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine, got together with writer Gore Vidal and film director Tinto Brass to create a film version of Caligula's life. This film was not going to be a whitewash, but an attempt to create a version of life in Rome true to the historical accounts, a movie unflinching in its portrayal of the violence and decadence of that ancient empire. There are various cuts of ""Caligula"" floating around in video store limbo, but the unrated version is the one you need to get in order to see all of the ubiquitous grotesqueness. An added extra on the disc, a ""making of"" documentary about the film, is immensely interesting to watch because it shows you the beginning of the controversy that eventually plagued the film. According to this behind the scenes footage, the original name of the film was ""Gore Vidal's Caligula,"" a title changed after Vidal's arguments with Brass and Guccione over some of the explicit content became irreconcilable. The interviews with the three principals reveal the beginnings of this argument. It is a nice for a film buff to see a record of this titanic clash of egos. Completely apart from the disagreements over the content of the film, this DVD extra does a great job of showing how the craftsmen made the excellent set pieces for this epic film.
As most people know, the film stars some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Sir John Gielgud as Nerva, Peter O'Toole as the Emperor Tiberius, Helen Mirren (kept on a strict leash, so to speak), and Malcolm McDowell as the deranged Caligula. Almost all of the stars distanced themselves from the movie after its release, probably due to Guccione and Brass's instance on inserting decidedly indecent scenes. While none of the stars appear in these explicit inserts, the repugnance of these images would send any mainstream actor shrieking for the door. In short, the film is pornographic and therefore potentially damaging to big name thespians.
Opinions about this movie tend to be polarized: some love the dramatic set pieces, the over the top acting by McDowell and O'Toole, and the atmosphere of a time long gone. Others see ""Caligula"" as total trash, full of bad acting, an overlong running time, and disgusting imagery. I think the response to this epic should lie somewhere in the middle, that McDowell does occasionally rise to grandeur in his depiction of this unsettled figure. At other times, his performance seems forced and grating. Witness his ""crazy"" laughter on the beach while the legions collect seashells. I laughed aloud at his pitiful attempt to portray a delusional madman in this scene. O'Toole and Gielgud do a good job with what they have to work with, and die off quickly enough to protect themselves from most of the critical backlash.
I enjoy films about the Roman Empire, with a few notable exceptions. The lessons learned about the dangers of unlimited power concentrated in the hands of one man should continue to serve as warnings for rulers throughout the ages. If this film helps to teach that lesson, all to the better. I suspect it won't, though, because it is difficult to take ""Caligula"" seriously at times. I recommend reading Suetonius; his biographical sketches of emperors from Julius Caesar to Domitian provide a much more helpful account of power run amok than this film does. He also includes sordid details too outrageous for even this movie. Moreover, a reading of Suetonius's sketch on Caligula reveals some possible motives about why Caligula acted as he did, something the movie does not do as well. Give it a shot if you must, but be ready for gratuitous violence and highly charged eroticism. By the way, the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired. It is grainy at times and is not the best transfer job ever done for a film.",1053129600,14,4764,4.882716049382716

Even Helen Mirram does quite well (if not up to par with her later roles)....however, the script is just terrible, the supporting cast is horrible, and the plot is just ridiculous. I give props to Guccione, Brass, and etc. for realistically visualizing Rome at the time of Caligula, and for the truly outrageous and elaborate sets, but everything else just doesn't cut it.
  As a porno, this movie is just dandy. There is a 10 minute lesbian scene, and a roughly 10-15 scene that features an orgy. This is only about a total of 30 minutes of hard-core material, and for a movie that goes on for nearly 3 hours....well, what can I say? I didn't watch the movie solely for the adult material (I did find out about the film from Penthouse magazine, so I knew what to expect, though!): Malcom MacDowell, Peter O'Toole....people like that just elevate the films that they appear in, and this is the case. In THIS case, an abyssmal flick is raised to the status of tolerable flick.
  As far as extras go, i'll give the film an extra star. A lengthy 'behind the scenes' featurette from the late 70's is informative and fascinating, particularly for giving the viewer an oppurtunity to see what went behind the construction of the massive, multi-million dollar sets. It also offers a rare oppurtunity to see Bob Guccoine in person, speaking about the film (even if he is garbed in chains and a leisure suit!). The actors' perspectives are also great. Beyond this, not much else....you can listen to the soundtrack without the speech, and it is truly a massive and powerful score to the film, nearly on par with the 40's-50's epics. A commentary track with either Guccione or McDowell would be great, but I suppose that perhaps the latter may have dis-associated himself with this picture over the years?
  Watch it for the quality acting. Watch it for the `adult' material.

637979,3,6303364438,"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era.  While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it.  Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence.  What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.
For a while it looked like it might.  CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade.  But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited ""R"" and original ""Unrated"" versions.  And no doubt Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.
The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day.  Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass.  Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.
Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.  There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure.  The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day.  In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.
In the accompanying documentary, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome.  If so, he missed the mark.  We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best.  That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultry was an offense punishable by death.  And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.
On the plus side, those sets and costumes are fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good.  The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form.  The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.  As for the DVD itself, the film is presented in its original ratio, but the term ""restored"" applies to previously censored scenes, not to the film itself, and the quality is so-so.  An unintentionally hilarious documentary is also included on the disk.
My final thoughts: the movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content.  Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's)are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstenance, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism.  If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough.  I suggest you rent it first.",1031011200,17,4023,4.842335766423358
637980,4,6303364438,"CALIGULA is an adult film with adult subjects. This is NOT for everyone to see - especially children and even adults who may be offended by this REAL historical persons existence. This movie is Malcolm McDowell. He shines in this feature from beginning to bloody end. The film came out in 1979 to very mixed reviews. The original release was later cut to achieve a strong ""R"" and most of the sequences that were cut were shelved and now released in their entirety. It was originally an ""X"" - for graphic violence and free sex - not pornography.
Directed by the Italian director - screen named Tinto Brass, the film takes you on a journey through the life of a very sick man. The film has quite a cast starting off with Malcolm McDowell in the lead role. In this production you can find the masterful talents of Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Geilgood.
The production value is very high and the costumes and set design are extraordinaire. TO think a man like this existed is sick. The film is not for the week stomach.

637981,1,6303364438,"Some movies are deliberately bad. Some are so deliberately bad that they are funny. This movie is most emphatically not one of them. This movie is execrable, but not deliberately so, and that is the most depressing thing of all. Someone actually thought it was good enough to warrant expending a lot of effort and money. Why else would they go to the trouble of hiring such actors as O'Toole and McDowell? I used to have some respect for Malcolm McDowell before I saw him in this crock of toxic waste. That's safely gone now, of course, but still I wonder why he accepted this role. Was he hard up for cash, or does he simply have no dignity? Or are both true? Either way, it was money ill spent. The acting is a mess, the plot is incomprehensible, the composer is a ... , whoever adapted the screenplay is an incompetent, and there are actually two directors, but all that does is give me one extra person to loathe. The fact that this movie is available on DVD is a testament to something so bad, the word to describe it has yet to be invented.
Why was this movie made? There are actually people who bother coming up with intellectual rationalizations for it - id est, ""Yeah, but this is the way things REALLY WERE!"" Nonsense. Softcore pornographer Tinto Brass and hardcore pornographer Bob Guccione did not come together one day and decide to direct a realistic historical epic. No, the right answer is the most obvious one and the most difficult one to face - they actually thought this horrible, horrible movie would titillate someone. Let me repeat that to let the horror sink in - they actually thought people would be titillated by a movie which contains a scene in which a man's genitals are severed and thrown to a pair of hounds (and if you think I'm making this up, I only wish I was as naive as yourself). They actually thought people would find eroticism in a movie in which there is not only none of it, but also no pleasure, no joy, in fact not a single human emotion whatsoever aside from a sort of smug self-satisfaction at one's own disgusting vileness. Not only did they fail as directors, artists and creators, but they failed as human beings. Their movie will be forever appreciated by those who are too creatively, mentally and emotionally bankrupt to find any amusement or pleasure in anything higher than smug, bloated maliciousness, but that still does not justify its having been made.
Tragically, their assumption wasn't too far off the mark. For me, the absolute worst came from having to watch this movie with other people. I'm not making any of this up: people around me actually _cheered loudly_ during the rectal fisting scene. Even wilder was their merriment during the scene in which two whores urinate on the corpse of a man who was just tortured to death (which you will also please believe that I am not making up). ""Cretinous"" is too weak a word to describe such reactions. Having to watch someone I love be genuinely entertained by this catalogue of disease was one of the most saddening and enraging events that I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.
I can forgive audiences who paid to see this in 1980. Back then, no one yet knew what an atrocity this movie is. But twenty-odd years have passed since then. Now no one has any shred of an excuse to see this movie. As you read this, it is entirely within your power to exercise a very small amount of effort and purchase _any_ other movie. If you pass up the chance to do this, and use your money to buy Caligula instead, I hope I never meet you.",1028505600,25,3547,4.517884914463453

Caligula was not only a genuine and very dangerous psycho! but a lunatic with a lot of power and a libido to match, and Malcolm Mc Dowell portrays this beautifully. Yet what makes Caligula a one off cinematic occurance is the sheer nerve of producer and Penthouse maestro Bob Guccione, by including hardcore porn in the film, as the legend goes after the mainstream actors and technicians went to bed!!And this combination adds a unique flavor to the film, it shows the decadence and depravity of romans, without being disgusting just maybe shocking and  real: in your face, porn.

The movie is about Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) a cruel and ruthless Roman leader of 37AD. His sickness and cruelty is well known. THe movie is done by Penthouse founder Bob Guccione who in his own right is a very smart man but I think forgot what he was doing. Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren, and Sir John Gielgud are all in this film but it is well known that all were very upset with the finished product. Mirren, a well known stage actor, plays Caligula's wife, a women who has gotten around. O' Toole is Tiberius the Cesar before Caligula. And Gielgud is Nerva. All the actors in this film are giving very bad, and somtimes stupid, dilouge to recite, but being so good the actors even pull of that demanding of a feat. At time's O' Toole is slightly over the top but considering the material he was giving he may have thought that it was worth overacting. Gielgud, however, seems to take his role very seriously and pulls off the role with a real flair, it has been said he was the most upset with the film becouse after it was shot Guccione went back and added some very hard sex scenes. Gielgud demanded his name be pulled from the film and to this day I have not seen one cover, credit, or list that mentions him as Sir. I originally saw this on cable TV and thought it was an interesting, if not uneven, film. So I thought that if I rented the Un-cut version I may find it more lucid, however it seemed more uneven than ever. If you are woundering if there is really any hardcore sex in the film or not I am here to tell you that there is. There are very graphic moments in the film. There is somthing to be said for the acting however and all of those involved have said that they thought they were making somthing different than what they saw at the screening. I have to belive them becouse the acting is at times very good. The movie however can't be saved by the good acting. The directing is really very bad and the film is very badly paced. When all is said and done it is a real shame that this movie is in the same light as Ben-Hur and Sparticus, when the film has no real right to be mentioned in such high company.

The film borrows heavily from Fellini's Satyricon and Kubrick's Clockwork Orange and attempts to shock us more than educate or entertain us. The ""shock value"" is all that can really be said for this film.
The portrayel of Caligula is one-dimensional and predictable. One never learns where Caligula got his childhood nickname ""Little Bootinkins"" nor learns much of his illustrious father Germanicus or any other details of his upbringing. McDowell is unconvincing as a Roman nobleman and statesman, nor is his portrayel of insanity very convincing either. One gets the feeling that Malcolm McDowell is just reprising his role of Alex from Clockwork Orange in a toga.
My only positive remarks would go to Peter O-Toole in the role of the aged and degenerate Tiberius. It is an inspiring performance that seems out of place in the context of this film. The camera work is amatuer and the acting is rather flat. The sets look [poorly made] and manufactured instead of solid and real. Indeed, Ancient Romans spent much of their time outdoors and this film is set almost entirely in indoor settings that look like bad science fiction sets left over from Barbarella. There is not a single scene filmed on location nor did the production take advantage of the city of Rome where it was filmed.
There was not enough depiction of Caligula's mental insanity and personal insecurities in my opinion. Suetonius tells us that no one was alowed to look down upon his balding head nor mention a goat in his presence. Caligula's obsession with his own divinity was also not shown to full effect. Why did they neglect to show his decision to erect a statue of Zeus at the temple in Jerusalem?
The DVD transfer is rather grainy and the picture quality is fuzzy. The sound is also not the best. This also adds to the ""cheapness"" and ""sleezy"" feel that I initially objected to at first. There is a lot of potential to this film that sadly, does not satisfy in the end.
In a nutshell, this film uses the story of Caligula to make a bad film about degenerate sex, rather than using degenerate sex to make a great film about Caligula!",1016668800,3,2212,4.703608247422681

And as if that wasn't enough, you have cut scenes(thats what they are like ) of sexual acts with absolutely no relation to the main story(dont worry there isn't one).All in all this is one unique film...it seems like a spoof of all Roman films ever made.
No wonder Macdowell from Clockwork Orange had his waterloo in this film...he overacts,hams and haws. And everyone seems to be hamming for all he/she is worth. Punctuated with hot sex scenes here and there....
It got 4 stars for the sheer ridiculousness. 1 star is for the DVD extra of the producer..an Italian slick Jim with chest hair showing and half a dozen chains explaining how this was high art.......the sheer pretentiousness of this pimpy guy was tooo much...",1015545600,4,1191,4.730769230769231

It's worth checking out as long as you don't get yourself all hyped up for ""The most controversial film of all time""...just watch it with the same mindframe you'd use to watch, say, ILSA: SHE-DEVIL OF THE S.S., or a low-budget slasher flick, and you'll have a heck (can I say that here?) of a time.",1011916800,,717,4.523076923076923

638040,4,6303364438,"Caligula is a non-stop parade of perversions, gore, and stunning sets.  Mix all that with a decent job of acting from some brilliant actors and you find that while you may be repulsed by some of what you see, you'll also want to see it again.
The movie graphically depicts of the rise and fall of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell), one of the most notorious of all Roman emperors.  It's rather straight forward in it's portrayal of the man and his exploits.  Throughout the movie you definitely get a feel for how demented Caligula became and in the end you are almost relieved when his life is ended.  The major draw back to the story line is that they never really develop any of the other characters and it leaves them as shallow figures.
Keep in mind that this movie was brought to us by Penthouse so to say that there is a fair amount of nudity and sex is an understatement.  There are also some rather gruesome scenes as well.  I've read many reviewers use these points to put the movie down, but what they fail to realize is that Rome did have it's dark days of mass perversion.  Yes, the movie did go over the top a bit, but it's not too far off from the decadence of the time.  If you keep this in mind you will love the movie.
As for the DVD itself.  The sound quality is much better the the original VHS version, but still leaves a bit to be desired.  The picture is a bit grainy and that does tend to draw away from the breathtaking sets.  I recommend the unrated version for the sole fact that the R-rated version cuts out a large chunk of the movie.

638041,1,6303364438,"The ""Spotlight Review"" is dead wrong; not only is Caligula's history pretty ridiculously bloody, violent, and sexual, the man himself went a whole heck of a lot further than this sad little flick does.  The key problem with ""Caligula"" isn't the violence, gore, or scanty hardcore porn footage anyway (if you're looking for those kind of jollies, look elsewhere), it's that these things were combined in a coldly cynical manner.  This is basically an attempt to cynically rack up the bucks.  Considering Guccione had to rent theaters to screen it, it makes you wonder just what the man was trying to prove.
Regardless, this movie really stinks.  The cast does a great job, no denying that, but they just can't win against the mindlessness of the script (poor Gore Vidal, I can't blame him for fighting to get his name taken off) or the shoddy direction.  This isn't even a fun exploitation flick; there's no joy or sense of fun here.
You're better off with ""Killer Condom"", or most of the Troma flicks.  Or any hardcore porn disc if you're looking for that kind of stuff.  Don't waste your time on this; for once, Maltin nailed it.",1007942400,5,1130,4.7055837563451774
638042,1,6303364438,"""You cannot possibly absorb all that there is in this film with one viewing,"" says Bob Guccione of his magnum opus, CALIGULA.  A pity, then, that the film is such a chore to sit through even once. Despite its clear aim to shock and offend, CALIGULA manages only to be an interminable bore.  It is, in a way, the Andrew ""Dice"" Clay of films.

Helen Mirren (one of several what-the-hell-are-YOU-doing-here members of the cast) once commented on the film's ""irresistible mixture of art and genitals.""  The genitals are there, all right, but there is very little art on display, save perhaps a few nicely designed sets.  As for irresistible... The acting ranges from passable to atrocious, the script has no idea where it is going or what it is trying to say, and virtually nothing in the film has any dramatic impact whatsoever. It is impossible, furthermore, to give a damn about any of the characters, apart from Caligula's sister, Drusilla. In this role, Teresa Ann Savoy actually acquits herself fairly well, and manages to escape with more of her dignity intact than anyone else in the cast.

Maybe these aspects of the film are not what interests you.  Know, then, that even as a ""guilty pleasure,"" the film is astonishingly unentertaining.  In their quest for notoriety, the filmmakers have crammed nearly every frame full of depravity of one sort or another.  It is difficult to imagine a non-porn film with more nudity and sex in it, but nearly all of this footage is unpleasant.  Apart from the ""not-bad hardcore footage"" to which Leonard Maltin refers, there's nothing even remotely titillating, let alone erotic, in the entire film.  As for the notorious graphic violence, this has not aged well.  It's still unpleasant enough, but rather than shock, it tends simply to embarrass.  And then, just when you think the film has hit rock bottom, Malcom McDowell crams his fist up somebody's (butt)...  Waiter? Check please.

The DVD features the sorriest excuse for a 'restored version' I have ever seen.  The image is grainy and occasionally ill-focused, and the sound ranges from good to lousy.  The one bright spot (and, really, the only reason to check out this DVD at all) is a perversely fascinating documentary entitled THE MAKING OF ""GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA"".  This hour-long, poorly-filmed feature gives ample insight into the laughable pretensions of Guccione et al., and includes most of the film's naughtiest bits besides (God only knows what audience it was intended for).

CALIGULA is a failure on every level.  See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you. If you want porn, get porn; if you want graphic violence, get ROBOCOP. If you want a hammy historical epic, get CLEOPATRA; if you want a good one - well, I'm afraid I can't really help you there. On other hand, if you're still curious, get the DVD, but skip the movie itself and watch the documentary instead. Trust me, you won't be missing anything.",1007596800,6,2932,4.837675350701403

638066,2,6303364438,"I will concentrate on the movie's historical accuracy (or its lack of it), since the previous reviews seem to either have overlooked it, or claimed that it is ""historically accurate"", or on the opposite extreme, that it totally ignored history.
""Caligula"" does have some merit from the historical point of view, surely already present in Gore Vidal's original script. It's also very weak in many points.
The bare events of Caligula's life and reign are actually quite accurate. It may surprise many viewers that most of the secondary characters - Emperor Tiberius, Senator Nerva, the praetorian prefect Macro, Tiberius's grandson and Caligula's rival for the succession Gemellus, Caesonia, Chaerea (who murdered Caligula), his sister Drusilla - were all historical and, as far as the facts have come down to us, their portrayal in ""Caligula"" was fairly accurate, at least according to some ancient authors.
Tiberius did retire to the island of Capri in his last years and did invite the elderly Nerva to join him there, and ancient authors do claim that he indulged in sexual perversions there. Nerva really committed suicide as shown in the movie.
The conversations between Caligula, Nerva and Tiberius, probably by Vidal, really reflect contemporary views and issues - for instance, the deification of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Tiberius's predecessors: Tiberius was totally cynical about the whole thing, whereas Caligula firmly believed it. Throughout the movie, many of Caligula's lines come straight from ancient authors.
On the other hand, Nerva's comment on Caligula's ""gift for logic"" seems to owe more to Camus than to ancient sources - still, a nice touch, I thought.
Tiberius's murder by Caligula and Macro, Caligula's removal of Macro and Gemellus, his incestuous relationship with Drusilla, her death, his marriage to Caesonia, her giving him a daughter, his increasing tyranny, his farcical invasion of Germany and attempted invasion of Britain, and his murder by his own guard - are all historical facts, and on the whole not too inaccurately shown in the movie.
On the other hand, the movie's biggest weaknesses from the historical point of view are (1) the way it *looks* and (2) the suggestion that Caligula's and Tiberius's depravity were somehow ""normal"", part of Rome's ""decadence"".
The sets and clothes all look more like something from a Fellini film than from ancient Rome. Tiberius's palace on Capri is perhaps the most unrealistic, along with that ship, and the execution machine - and countless details.
The clothes aren't very realistic, either. Romans were more casual about nudity than we are today, and I suppose that their clothes might reveal much some times. But I doubt that Roman ladies would be as casual about parading half-naked as portrayed in the movie (I mean in normal situations, not the sex scenes).
Moreover, it's simply not true that ""orgies"" such as that portrayed in the movie were common among the Roman upper classes. Actually adultery - also on the part of males - was an offense punishable by death, at least for the upper classes (this didn't cover prostitution). The vast majority of the Roman senatorial class would, and did, find behavior such as that of Tiberius and Caligula scandalous.
However, Caligula's in cognito wanderings through Rome after Drusilla's death give perhaps for the first time in a movie a good impression of what ancient Rome actually was at night - dangerous, dark, chaotic, where no person of means would venture without an armed escort.
I also enjoyed the glimpse of what an emperor's routine largely consisted of, with Tiberius and Caligula stamping their seal onto endless piles of official documents.
""Caligula"" was obviously intended to be mainly a pornographic movie - Bob Guccione made sure of that. But it also, at some point, was intended to have a core of historical accuracy, which is why Gore Vidal was asked to write the script.
This core is still present in the movie, and it's not true that you don't learn anything of Roman history by watching it.
But of course, I know that that's not what most people will watch it for. So perhaps Guccione was right.",1000598400,408,4152,5.062773722627737
638067,3,6303364438,"Some epics are famous for their content.  Braveheart, for instance, revitalized interest in William Wallace and might be credited with drumming up support for the Scottish National Party and the new Scottish Parliament.  Others are famous for their quirks; Spartacus director Stanley Kubrick employed the ""Hollywood Ten"" blacklist, a group of people accused of communist activities by the McCarthy witchunt.  Still others, like Lawrence of Arabia, are so unique in their locations, subject matter, and cinematographic pioneering that they top the list of influences of every major movie director - and a lot of the minor directors, too.
Caligula, on the other hand, is famous for being the most expensive pornography film ever created.
I'm not going to bother summarizing plot, as there really isn't any to speak of.  Obstinately, it's a historical epic about Emperor Caligula, the ruler that was responsible for such excellent history-class tibits as naming his horse a Senator and marching the Roman Garrison into the ocean because he'd declared war on Neptune, drowning them by the thousands.  And you thought our presidents were bad!  The movie, from a script by Gore Vidal (that he attempted to disown), details Caligula's personal insanity, including his incestuous relationships with his sister and the forces that plot against him, both real and imaginary.
Say what you will about the film, it is still a $15 million porno flick, with better actors than usual.  If you're going to take the plunge to buy it, then get the blue-packaged Unrated version.  Not only does it have the extra hardcore, but it is the only one with 5.1 sound and the interview segment with Gore Vidal himself.  The DVD is OK; the title screens are well-done, but the video transfer looks almost like a VHS tape, fuzzy and full of dust.  Sound, at least on the Unrated version, is decent, making full use of all channels, but it is pretty obvious that the soundtrack wasn't remastered for the DVD release.
If you're feeling particularly masochistic, there's no reason to add this title to your collection, other than just to have it there.  Fans should pay the extra for the Unrated version, but anyone who hasn't seen it will probably want to make the trip to their local video store first.",999561600,138,2272,4.984126984126984

638069,4,6303364438,"This is one of the last x-rated movie that played on the public theaters. However, the movie is based on the real roman emperor who was finally assasinated by his military guards.
You must understand some stories in the movie are mainly fictional but it is highly praised the settings and clothes are similar to those of the ancient Rome.
The main story just shows how the clever, highly popular and young emperor becomes brutal and cruel monster. At last he met the tragic death. In the movie, it's because of the death of his only one true lover, his younger sister. In fact, some historians believe that the brother and sister had some kind of sexual relationships.
I think this movie makes you know about historical background of the ancient Rome. So, I must say if you want to understand the movie, you should read some history books about the early days of the Roman Empire. The family tree of the Roman Emperor is very complicated.
But you should not expect too much from this movie. Because it is made as a pornography and some actors act so terrible.
In addition, the most historical happening during regime of emperor Caligula is the killing of his mother. History says he is the one who ordered to do that. But it's not mentioned in the movie.
For more, he is an adopted grandson of the great emperor Augustus. His father was famous Roman governor general who almost conquered the Germany but died too easily when he fell down from his horse.",996710400,7,1453,4.592307692307692
638070,3,6303364438,"Screenplay butcherings and unnecessary sex aside, this movie proves entertaining for those who find the enormously morbid amusing. While a man's rise to and corruption by absolute power is an old idea, both historically and artistically, ""Caligula's"" chronicling of one of the older and more well-known cases is rather fascinating, if only for the freakishness and outlandishly atrociousness of it. Having not read Vidal's original screenplay, I can only hope that it contained more than merely a generous helping of Suetonius' tabloid-style biography of the man backed by excessively provacative scenes of cruelty and public humiliation and death. Still, if you find the hyper-disturbing appealing (which I do, though not enough to watch this over and over), you may enjoy this.
Of course, there are the porno scenes, which add little, if anything, to story; for instance, the lesbian scene in Scene 19 of the DVD is completely unnecessary, while the portion involving Caligula's ""Imperial Bordello"" goes on far too long. Only one, I found, could not be almost completely skipped over: that of Tiberius' (Peter O'Toole) orgy room, which interlaces images too frantically with Tiberius' character development to miss entirely,though I do consent that his character--a mad, perverted tyrant--is quickly established. If unnecessary sex scenes--almost certainly tacked on by Guccione when Brass and the cast weren't looking; it's right there in the credits: ""additionally footage directed by Bob Guccione...edited by Penthouse Productions""--do not appeal to you (though that may be your intention: purchasing porn cleverly disguised as sensational biopic), then you probably will want to rent or purchase the R-rated version.
A word on the quality: horrible. The footage is grainy, some lines are out of synch with lips, and I know I saw a hair in the film towards the end (on a DVD!). Still, the movie is watchable (in terms of visibility, anyway), although I felt the porn scenes had been touched up noticeably more than any others.
Acting, now. The performances by the principle actors (McDowell, van Savoy, and Mirren) make up for a piecemeal story of increasing morbidity. As said before, most of ""Caligula"" seems drawn more out of Suetonius' shock-value history than any screenplay, but this is rendered almost unnoticable by McDowell's laudable, nearly over-the top performance as the sociopathic mad dictator, which perhaps matches nicely the original ambition of the project, if not the outcome. At times (read, ""frequently""), however, that performance comes dangerously close to McDowell's character Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"" (another, better bit of disturbing cinema, though not as grotesque).
Final review: Quality of film--weird and overly ambitious. Porn scenes--annoying, and mostly unnecessary. DVD quality--[not-good]. Acting--great, drawing attention away from a fragmented plot.

Bob  Guccione sponsored this film through production but was unsatisfied by the  amount of nudity director Tinto Brass had filmed.

So, rather than getting an amazingly boring Roman epic (as  Brass' footage indicates), we get the same boring film with some grotesque,  over-the-top pornography.  Of course, nothing about this movie is  subtle--McDowell gives an exaggerated imitation of his role from A  Clockwork Orange, yet fails to make us fear him the way that earlier role  did.  The violence is nasty beyond words.  In fact, the excessively bloody  sexual mutilation and decapitation ruins any erotic potential the movie's  numerous sex scenes had.

638109,5,6303364438,"This movie is a masterpiece in that it accomplishes what it set out to do: to depict decadent, pagan Rome circa 37 AD. I cringed throughout the FIRST  VIEWING, unsure what to expect, fearing revulsion in each scene. The SECOND  VIEWING was better, I knew what to expect: a simple plot about unchecked  power with gratuitous violence and sex. Guccione may have overstated the  sex and violence but that is what you get from pagan cultures. The THIRD  VIEWING reveals the movie as art: as pornographic and dangerous as ancient  Rome at its worst with interesting props and sets. Maybe Guccione wanted to  contrast sexual cultures of ancient Rome with his magazine culture of  today: to prove that he himself and/or current exploitation of women isn't  so bad after all--only sexually explicit. Generally, sex of any kind still  has a bad reputation.  This movie only needs be a reasonably accurate  historical account (ostensibly derived from museum artifacts commonly found  around the world) to maintain historical relevance. Many will hate this  sort of reality, but not every movie has to ""sublimate"" reality  according to family movie standards to please puritanical hypocrites. Face  it: only a world as lost as Caligula's could crucify Christ.  (Notice how  persecution against the spiritually pure was greatest then?) Yes (?)  Nevertheless, this movie entertains by being so over-the-top that exquisite  sound and editing are not necessary. Again, this was the real Rome.  Finally, if you are an adult who desires full knowledge of the depth of  human depravity, then Vidal, Guccione, et al. should be praised for  accomplishing such an important (by virtue of its controversy) historical  film. I recommend this film to everyone to either love or hate. I love it!",966124800,213,1770,5.108391608391608
638136,3,6303364438,"Movies like this look much better in print then they are.  ""The Most Controversial Movie in History"" is the best title for it.  It is one  of those movies that a bunch of guys rent on a Friday night just to see how  far it goes. Well having seen it I can say that it goes FAR!  WAY TOO FAR!  Do not get me wrong, the acting and the sets are wonderful (the actors that  aren't Penthouse pets or porn stars).  Malcom Macdowell is great in the  title role.  But the movie is just plain sickening.  The porn factor is one  thing (some of the most graphic sexual activity you will ever see in a  major motion picture) but the violence is way out of control.  There is no  redeaming value to watching dogs hungrily eat a man's genetaila after being  castrated.  And the sexual content goes beyond just the graphic orgies.  There is beastiality, necrophilia, homosexuality, midgetry, etc... Sorry  guys, you won't be watching this one in history class anytime soon.  The  movie makes you want to jump in the shower after it ends for there is  nothing clean about it at all.  It is really quite sickening.  But if you  watch it for the basic reason just so you can say you have seen it all,  then there is some value to the film I guess.  But be forwarned, it doen't  just push the limits, it destroys them.",966124800,5,1299,4.3
638137,1,6303364438,"Much has been made of the promotion that ""Caligula"" is the most controversial film in history. If it is, then it must not be controversial  because of historical value like let's say, Oliver Stone's ""JFK,""  no, it has just caused a ruckus because it is THE motion picture porno.  ""Caligula"" is a big, boring and badly-filmed mess. There is no  historical value here because it's obvious that it concentrates more on the  sex, rape, necrophilia and bestiality than the history it tries to portray.  The dialogue is corny, the plot is a big mess that you never understand and  it makes no sense. There are scenes of carnage that are unnecessary, like  one where a man's genitals are cut off and fed to dogs who happily eat them  on camera. I'm not against violence in movies, but most of the violence  here has no meaning. ""Caligula"" was so bad, in fact, that the  director removed his name from the credits upon release, it's also obvious  that most of the porn must have been shot behind some of the talent's back  considering I don't think a screen legend like Peter O'Toole who played  Lawrence Of Arabia would appear in a muddled mess like this. Look, just  take out the togas, fancy (small-looking and un-epic) sets and other Roman  attire, hell, take out the cheesy dialogue, and you have here a porno film.  I'm sure the story of Caligula can be told with realism and style (which is  badly needed here), but not like this. The movie doesn't care about it's  history, only about the sex. Some may say, ""well, that was what Rome  was like."" Yes, we know Rome was a little Penthouse party most of the  time, but there was also history and intriguing characters involved,  ""Caligula"" just looks at the Penthouse stuff and ignores the  characters and history. When I read the DVD cover, I was expecting  something pretty good, because I support daring, provocative cinema, but  ""Caligula"" was a depressing experience, it is probably the worst  movie I have ever seen, if not ever been made. I wouldn't be surprised if  the supposedly used screenplay was ignored, just look at the credits, no  one is credited with actually writing this pile of trash, the writing  credit only states that the film is BASED on a screenplay by Gore Vidal.  Now what could that mean? In the end, ""Caligula"" is a sickening,  depressing movie. You won't be surprised if you find yourself yawning in  boredom thinking: ""What the hell is the point of this movie?""",965347200,20,2441,4.657276995305164

The movie is well cast, and for me that saves  the movie and makes it worth having. This is probably the only  time you  see a cast this good in a movie this graphic.

638140,4,6303364438,"Caligula, one of the most controversial movies ever made, is now available on DVD.  This film was a real eye-opener for me, and the DVD is far superior to the VHS that was floating around a bit in the '80s (for all you  people complaining about the quality, just shudder to think of how it used  to be).  The story of Rome's infamous emperor was probably not this wild in  real life, but this is Penthouse and as a result is chockablock with sexual  scenes and graphic violence.  Because Caligula is basically in every single  scene, it's hard for the other characters to develop, but there are some  colorful supporting players, and McDowell really delivers.  It's hard to  believe his next film was to play the reserved, scholarly H.G. Wells  (""Time After Time."")  He is quite a talented actor.  The movie  drags on and on, and sometimes the cinematography is uncertain, but other  times it is dead on the money.  The film is a bit grainy on DVD, but as  someone else once said, this really contributes to the ""gritty""  factor.  As far as realism, many of the sex scenes look real, but I doubt  the world has ever seen the likes of that purple-skinned four-eyed (or was  it three-eyed?) woman, plus the guy with all those extra digits and the  siamese twins joined at the head resting at Tiberius' palace.  And how  about the scene where Caligula ""consecrates"" that marriage...if  that's how it was, I'd never get married.
The DVD has these things  going for it: the creepy music added to the menu (the same as the opening  title with the quote from Mark), the 30 chapters nicely divided up, the  documentary about the making of featuring Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione  (although in places everyone's face looked way too pale, but it was an old  '70s film), and the sound is far superior to the VHS from what I can  remember.
But this is Caligula and I would definitely not let anyone  under 18 (or maybe even 21) watch it.",961286400,455,1923,4.529239766081871

(we're talking hardcore sex), but the violence, while harsh, is not half as graphic as most people would have you believe (in fact, a little less sex  and a bit more violence would have made this film more entertaining).  It  is obvious where the money was spent (lavish sets and top-notch lead  actors), but it is also obvious where the money was not spent (poor  direction and sometimes hap-hazard editing).  While the film-makers tried  to show the decadence of Rome, the film only succeeds in assaulting the  viewer with scene after scene of heterosexual, homosexual, transgender and  mutant sex (yes, mutant sex!) interspersed (all too infrequently) with  scenes of graphic violence.  Caliguala even ends up in bed w/ a horse.  There is not a whole lot of stylistic visual appeal in this film either.  Instead, the film-makers just go for shock value, heading into Fellini  territory by populating the scenes w/ non-stop nudity and mutants.  McDowell gives an excentric performance as Caligula, while O'Tool seems to  be the only one having any fun as the old emperor Tiberius.  The rest of  the cast just drifts through the film till they are killed off.  The worst  part about this film is the fact that it goes on for 156 minutes!  Not a  great film, but certainly worth seeing once so you can tell your kids that  you saw the most notorious big-screen movie release in history.

Despite its explicit nature, Caligula is quite a good  film. Malcolm McDowell(who, in my opinion, is in the top 10 greatest actors  of all time)is very good, as always, as are Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren,  and Sir John Gielgud. They more than make up for a few corny (some  downright stupid) plot and visual elements.  The plot revolves around  Caligula, a young man who becomes emperor of Rome after he has his uncle,  the current emperor, killed. It takes the viewer through a graphic (yet  historically accurate)display of the decadence of ancient Rome(with very  convincing set pieces) as it shows Caligula's slow decline into insanity.  Before viewing this film keep in mind that it is very graphic in its  violence and sex (unless you're viewing the R-rated version that has almost  1 hour cut from its original running time). Also keep in mind that although  it is graphic, it is also (for the most part)historically accurate. So, if  you want to see some of the most impressive sets in recent memory & a  few of the world's greatest thesbians at work and beleive you can handle  its extreme nature, I would definatly give Caligula a try.",957657600,116,1305,4.657894736842105

After  it was over I walked home through the seedy streets of a near 3:00 AM  Chicago, devoid of any fear or trepidation, for I had endured a pain far  worse than anything reality could inflict.

First of all, the movie quality was a little  grainy, but I don't think it could be helped given the original source.  This movie is definately not for the squeamish or prude, as the boxcover  suggests.  There is a lot of explicit sex, and plenty of bloodshed (though  sometimes it seems corny unintentionally).  Storywise, there really isn't  much there.  A young man becomes emporer through assasination and slowly  becomes contaminated by the power that he has given himself.  One can see a  hint at his psychological breakdown, but there are other psychological  movies that do it better.  I guess this movie would be best classified as  porn that seriously wanted to have a plot, but ends up failing in it's  pretensiousness.  And the big orgy scene is near the end, and it is  comparible to most porn in the 70's, nothing special.  If you want to get  this for the sex, I think you are better off renting a full fledged porno.  Malcom McDowell does give a pretty good performance, but many parts of it  reminded me of his Alex character in Kubrick's ""A Clockwork  Orange"", and you'd probably be better off seeing that one.  Now you  are probably wondering why I gave it four stars...  I happen to be a fan of  campy cheese flicks (John Water's Pink Flamingoes is right up my alley),  and this in a way, isn't too far from that camp.

First off, the unrated version contains about 20 minutes of hardcore  predominantly heterosexual material in the form of short intercuts in the  main action. This material improves the film rather alot by slowing the  pacing and (strangely) has the effect of rendering Malcom McDowell's as  Caligulas descent into suicidal craziness more understandable and amusing.  A ""descent into suicidal craziness"" *amusing* you ask? Yes.  Caligula is an intelligent and powerful film but at no point could it be  accused of taking itself seriously. This is Roman history according to  Suetonius with a very big nod to Fellini. The humour is broad, the sets are  brilliant and the point of the film is nothing short of scorching.
The  DVD mastering is not the best I have ever seen but is massively better than  VHS (and is in the correct aspect ratio.) The sound is more than good  enough and the extra features quite reasonably good.
If you like adult  entertainment, by which I mean films intended for adults as opposed to  those who like ""good guys bad guys and explosions"" this is most  definitely one to watch again and again.

I think it was thoughful of the filmmakers to use  Penthouse Pets as actresses.
The ""Making of..."" featurette is  worth the price of the whole movie! Guccione's monologues look like they  were recorded in his house which looks like it was decorated by someone  with more money than brains... or taste. But it is perfectly fitting with  his unbuttoned shirt, gold chains, disco look! This is a hilarious snapshot  of the absolute worst of the 70's!

Although he only served a short time, his antics and deviances have endured for more than two thousand years.  Most of what is  portrayed in this movie is the recountment of Seutonius, a  ""secretary"" to many Caesars after Caligula (""Little  Boots""), so is mostly ""rumours"" of his time -- though  historians do give him much credit for detailing many credible stories.  In  any event, if you believe what you see as Roman history, so be it -- you'll  be even more appalled at the vulgar and demented behaviour of this man.

Not in  form but in principle it reminds me of the late 19- early 20 century  pornography. It is known for it's exploitation of the historical settings  as an excuse for showing bare t.t and a.s. The ""live pictures""  like ""Julius Caesar stumbles upon Cleopatra making love to the common  legionaire"" were abundant.
Later lots of American and Italian  directors made their actors impersonate Messalina and Neron having their  orgies in the papier-mache palaces in their cheap soft-porno  productions.
With Caligula-80 the serious step was taken in two  directions - both historical and erotic. The Roman settings became more  than an excuse and sex is much more detailed and sadistic.
It was an  interesting experiment. Of course we know that the Romans were very  lecherous and cruel making no difference between males and females -  anything to make their sex life more eventful.  But one thing is to  understand this on the verbal level and seeing all this in detail is  something different.
It's like watching the heroine dancing in a fluffy  dress through the romantic comedy and knowing she is human too and  sometimes she uses the toilet just like we all do. And then you follow her  through the toilet's door to make sure.
So I do not see this film as  something more than an experiment - the O'Toole and McDowell act, the  starlets display their genitals - it's an uneasy marriage, this mule of a  film is not able to have a progeny.",947116800,11,1655,4.773851590106007

Penthouse only portrayed the Roamns as they  were, and may I ad they did an excellent job at it.  The death of Caligula  could have been better.  The scenography is good, I could not find a single  mistake.  they even got the small details down pretty well.  Excellent Job.  without a doubt, the best thing the movie has to offer is the acting by  McDowel.  He should have received the oscar for that year",944870400,6,581,4.461538461538462
638281,2,6303364438,"I SAW this movie on the big screen 20 years ago. Now I see it is digitally re-edited... poor scene transitions and crops when not needed. The color and sound is still great, except when the sound STOPS at a bad edit. It's  still watchable, but barely. I was going to put it in my ""must  keep"", but the flimsy box is also disappointing. For the most part the  acting and timing are perfect.",944092800,5,389,4.22972972972973
638282,5,6303364438,"It doesn'et get better than this.  Definately not for the prudish or squeamish.  This is an epic tale of lust, violence, sex and debauchery.  Many will hate it, considering it nothing more than porn.  However, I feel  that its uncompromising look at sexual obessions is one of it's most  endearing qualities.  Without a doubt you will not be able to take your  eyes off the screen!  Lavish and grand on every level!",939859200,7,415,4.652777777777778
