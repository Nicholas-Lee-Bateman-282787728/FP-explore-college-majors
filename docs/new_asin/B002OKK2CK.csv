8376051,4,B002OKK2CK,"Learn to work a scene from different angles and with different lighting. Find other subjects in that same location. Consider not only the light, but the breeze that may affect your image.  It is a DVD definitely for beginners who have some control over their cameras.  It is interesting, but not great.  I learnt more from Tony Sweets DVDs in this series of Master Photo Workshops.",1472860800,,381,4.742424242424242
8376052,5,B002OKK2CK,Great DVD. Techniques that are always good to improve as a photographer. It is really easy to understand and explained in such of a simple manner that any amateur can understand.,1329177600,,178,4.774193548387097
8376053,5,B002OKK2CK,"New England Color DVD by Jim Zuckerman is an awesome DVD. The two DVD package is a complete workshop. The ""In The Field"" DVD takes you on five photoshoots in the New England area.  He shares his knowledge with you so that you can improve you next shoot.  The shoots he chooses are excellent.

The second DVD is ""In The Studio.""  Here he illustrates how to perform post processing to make those shots ""POP!""  His Photoshop tips are precise and to the point emphasizing an understanding of Photoshop rather than just trying to remember a bunch of steps. I have purchased many other works dedicated for Digital Photographers that contain far less practical information than this DVD.

You can't go wrong with any of Jim's works and I highly recommend this one.",1272067200,,757,4.696969696969697
8376054,4,B002OKK2CK,"This is a very good video by Jim Zuckerman.
In my opinion it is intended to beginners, however there is always something we can learn from an experienced photographer like Jim.
I would recommend this video to beginners and intermediate level photographers.",1264809600,,256,5.119047619047619
8376055,2,B002OKK2CK,"I purchased this dvd after purchasing another in the series by Tony Sweet, which I recommend. This one I cannot. I recognize Jim Zuckerman as a great photographer (that's why I purchased it!), but this edition is very light on good technique. You watch a segment of Jim photographing a scene, and then up pops the actual images he's taken. The horizon lines are badly tilted in several, the highlights are blown out on several, the overall images presented are subpar for a professional photorapher of his stature. To me this looks like a rushed editing job, and Jim just isn't that exciting a presenter, or as a teacher in this presentation. Just not worth the money, unless you are absolutely starting out and you never used a DSLR before, then you might pick up a few tips. I've photographed New England over the years many many times, and never realized that autumn there could ever look this average. Now let me say something about Jim himself, he's a fine fine photographer, and many of his images are right up there with the best photographers on the planet, but this is not his shining moment in the sun to be frank.",1262822400,3,1124,4.597014925373134
8376056,5,B002OKK2CK,"In my opinion, every DVD that Jim Zuckerman has created has helped students of digital photography become better photographers, and this DVD is no exception.  He shares his techniques, use of equipment with students who can incorporate the hints into their own work.

I now have 3 of his DVDs and find them very helpful.  This enhances the knowledge received with classes and books.",1260835200,,382,4.9375
8376057,5,B002OKK2CK,"This is a great DVD. Jim really goes in depth on what he is thinking and on why he chooses to shoot a subject this way or that way over another he could do. Though this is done in New England the areas covered are things you can find almost anywhere you live, so going right out to try some of the techniques is not difficult. Things like a church, river and cemetery. Okay, I don't have a lighthouse I can get to easily in Idaho, but the same ideas could be used on other things.

On Disk two Jim goes through a portfolio and shows some Photoshop techniques. Some of you may or may not be interested and other may already know this stuff, but I really found it invaluable. Another thing I like is Jim does not come across like he is doing a DVD, he goes through the whole thing as if you were there and he was talking to you specifically. Though he uses Canon he never really seems to endorse it. Some people seem to go really into the brand they use as if they were trying to sell you the products they use. Jim of course states what he is using but only to let you know, so you can use your equivalent, or same gear. At least that's what it seemed like to me. Sounds weird I know.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for tips and help to improve their photography. I also have another one in this series with Tony Sweet and though it's great, Jim seems to go into a bit more detail. I would buy this one first",1258502400,3,1429,4.0638297872340425
8376058,5,B002OKK2CK,Mr. Zuckerman has done a terrific presentation of what could be a very dry subject. He has a down to earth delivery and keeps it interesting. I would recommend this DVD highly to anyone interested in landscape photography.,1256083200,3,222,4.868421052631579
