5798178,1,B00DGNFMMY,"Universal studios really does not care about quality for the product they sell.  I had multiple returns for numerous series and their seasons.  Each one, it took up to a minimum of three returns before my set was workable.  The cases have been badly damaged, multiple scratched DVD's.  So I returned this set, no thanks.  I don't want to hire the a-team for my collection.  Sad to say.  Six million dollar man had the same issues, but I cared enough about the series that I took 3 to 4 times to get a good set.  This is not Amazon's fault.  Amazon has been an incredible service.  This reflects on Universal Studios release only.  Highly disappointed... Fact:  Amanda Culea who played Amy was fired, because she wanted more action.  Well, that was not the intention for an 80's series for women.  They expected them to look pretty on set, smile a lot and have little to do with the show.  So the series let her go half way through Season 2.  Bionic woman is both pretty and had her own series.  I have no problem with women kicking the bad guys butts.  I own Season 1 and 2 and both sets are okay, they work.  But I had to exchange Season 2 multiple times.  Two different boxed sets.  This is ridiculous.",1393977600,2,1204,4.381818181818182

8593005,2,B00DGNFMMY,"Despite refreshing off-format stories and fun performances from its featured guest stars, season 4 of The A-Team suffered from low ratings, and a shortened season followed (with just 13 episodes, including the 3-part opener). Rather than continuing the story from the season 4 finale, this season goes in a totally different direction. The team is blackmailed by the mysterious General Stockwell, carrying out a rescue mission that blows back and results in them getting caught and falsely convicted of murder by the military. After escaping, the general makes a deal to send them on unofficial missions, with the promise of an eventual full pardon. Fans missed the show's old signatures (even the theme song is remixed to a fast-paced synth tune) and even now the 5th season is mostly disregarded as a waste...sadly, several 80s shows fizzed out instead of going out on top, and The A-Team was no exception.

To be fair, this season isn't all bad, it's just that things just really feel off. From its inception, the show owed some debts to Mission: Impossible, but this season's ""international intrigue"" missions take away its original flavor (helping decent Americans fight off the bigwig bad guys). Stockwell is a really boring character; I missed the old MPs who used to chase the team around. A new member is added to the team: Frankie Santana (special effects man) who is just superfluous and functions in places where Face (con artist/charmer) or B.A. (electronics/demolitions expert) should be on screen. Face's Corvette is only seen once in the first episode, the van is rarely used and usually beaten up anyway, and Murdock is found sane...now he just works a different job each episode (his personality is toned down a lot, and despite putting in some good effort, even Schultz seems checked out in the last few episodes). The plots are all very different, so I'll just point them out here:

1- DISHPAN MAN: The team sent on a mission to rescue a Colonel who can clear them; he betrays them and they are captured by the military. This was a solid start to the season, and seeing the team (including Frankie) fake a plane's lift-off was great (and straight out of M:I).
2- TRIAL BY FIRE: The team on trial; Murdock and Frankie work behind the scenes to find a witness who may clear them. Little action, mostly courtroom drama, more a bridge episode than something special.
3- FIRING LINE: The A-team found guilty and scheduled for execution; Murdock and Frankie, with help from Stockwell, mount a rescue. A good ending to the trilogy and for better or worse it does get you excited for this season.
4- QUARTERBACK SNEAK: The team sent to East Germany to get a scientist out; Hannibal poses as the owner of a football team and stages an exhibition to throw the enemy agents off. This is one of the few episodes this season with guest stars (Joe Namath, Jim Brown and others as football players). The story doesn't make much sense and falls apart in the end. A weird choice for the first regular episode.
5- THE THEORY OF REVOLUTION: The team sent to a small South American island to rescue US agents. This episode captures the old A-Team spirit, with an evil dictator ransacking a small village and the team rallying the rebels to fight back. The kid actor was awful though!
6-  THE SAY UNCLE AFFAIR: Stockwell kidnapped by a former partner who wants to know where the A-Team has stored their stolen soviet fighter jet. This episode pays homage to The Man from UNCLE, having David McCallum as a guest star, similar scene transitions, act titles, etc.
7-  ALIVE AT FIVE: The team retrieves a reporter who discovered an assassination plot against a union leader; Face keeps trying to quit the team for good but ends up being chased back several times. It comes out of nowhere and like threads in other episodes seems to be there only to eat up the run time. The only episode to heavily feature the van (which is only in a few minutes of the season otherwise).
8- FAMILY REUNION: A criminal with a diary of crooked politicians needs to be protected; he may be Face's father, but only Murdock knows this and he tells Murdock not to reveal it to Face. The only ""personal"" episode this season, and Dirk Benedict is great in the end.
9-  POINT OF NO RETURN: Hannibal captured during a cover assignment in Hong Kong; the team goes in to rescue him and stop a plutonium sale at the same time. An interesting episode with twists and turns, and I like how everyone plays a part in the plot.
10-  THE CRYSTAL SKULL: After retrieving it for another mission, the team's plane crashes on a Pacific island and the tribesmen see Murdock as a God; after it's stolen, the team must get it back and stop a slave-driven diamond mining ring at the same time. I'm iffy on this one, it has some good ideas but poor execution and somehow seems offensive.
11-  THE SPY WHO MUGGED ME: Murdock plays a secret agent (pretty much straight up Bond) to stop an assassin. Starts off fun but the joke wears thin and like much of the season the story doesn't hold together and the pacing is off at times.
12- WITHOUT RESERVATIONS: The last aired but really second-to-last episode; a hit is going down at the restaurant Murdock works at; how can he and the team stop it and save a dying man at the same time? A good episode but again it stretches things out a lot, and why is there no background music?
13- THE GREY TEAM: A Little girl thinks her father is a traitor, so she steals his briefcase full of Star Wars defense files and hides out at an old folks' home. OMG this was awful in every way, from the plot to the girl's acting/voice to the elders fighting back against hired guns to Murdock seducing a scientist for no real reason but to fill time. The editing is bad, the jokes are grating, everyone on the team either looks foolish or has little to do, and the last we see of the van is with its tires shot out! It does actually end the series with a few lines by the team as they discuss their future, but otherwise it's a one of the worst tv episodes of any series I've ever seen!",1463529600,2,6063,4.572217111315547
