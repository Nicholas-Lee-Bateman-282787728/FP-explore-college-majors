8626064,4,B00GP99CHM,"I discovered this  series on Netflix, and I loved season 1&2. So, I waited anxiously for season 3. It was really good until the last episode, then it is a BIG disappointment. How could they do that to the main character, then just leaving it hanging without knowing what happened to her?
  Anyway..Overall it was good, but just ruined at the end.",1393545600,2,346,4.548387096774194

I couldn't bear with watching movies uploaded on youtube, so I bought the whole 3 series.
A must buy who loves dance and ballet.",1387670400,2,211,4.3
