8184046,3,B0007VNPCC,"I had purchased this video KNOWING what it was.  I was excited that I could afford it but I regretted the purchase afterward.  As a DJ, I wanted to use this on a projector or on a video display as used at other clubs on mute.  Purchasing the video means needing to get the Amazon video software and viewing is ONLY POSSIBLE on the software.  The format is 4:3 and there are NO options to change the aspect ratio.  Enlarging the display only worsened the quality.  There is potential here to re purchase the video, as it itself is all to be expected; his decision rides solely on the improvement of the Amazon Video player.",1359676800,,622,4.3652173913043475
