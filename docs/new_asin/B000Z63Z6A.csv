8234796,4,B000Z63Z6A,"I watched this movie many many years ago. It was recommended by my father. He told me that it is a very old movie, and, a simple war movie. Not much explosive action like the other war movies. But , the characters in it are real, and, they can be found everywhere anytime. One word to summarize it all : Human Nature. After I watched it, I learnt a lot about many things. I am glad now that I own it - both as a classic movie collector,  and, to remember my father's way of sharing a piece of wisdom via a simple war movie....",1420329600,,526,4.0095238095238095
8234797,4,B000Z63Z6A,"This was an older movie, shot in black and white.  Excellent performances all around by Lawrence Harvey, Richard Todd and the rest.  The story itself was rather thin, but the performances made up for it.  I found it a little difficult to keep up with the British accents but that did not detract from the film; I just had to listen hard.  I would recommend this film.  (that should be 'up' not 'us')",1420070400,,399,4.410958904109589
8234798,5,B000Z63Z6A,I AM RATING THIS AND I NEVER GOT TO VIEW THE MOVIE I BOUGHT. I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK BECAUSE IT CAME FROM GREAT BRITTON. IT IS MADE ON A DIFFERENT CLASS OF DVD'S. I HOPE SOMEDAY TO GET TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN BEFORE I DIE. IT IS A GREAT FILM AND WITH SOME EXCELLANT BRITISH STARS. IT WOULD BE NICE IF TCM WERE TO PUT IT ON TV FOR MEMORIAL DAY WEEK-END HONORING ALL THE VETERANS; EVEN ONES FROM ACROSS THE SEAS. I WILL WAIT IMPATIENTLY FOR A CHANCE TO GET A COPY. THANK YOU...,1399334400,,474,3.8469387755102042
8234799,4,B000Z63Z6A,"This film has a great cast, including some British stars whose careers were just getting going.
There is not a large amount of action, what they have is quite good.
The psychology of jungle war also comes into play.
I really enjoyed it, but it may not interest viewers who don't care for war films.",1377475200,,298,4.4363636363636365
8234800,4,B000Z63Z6A,"Tactics are coming up short in this one; no land nav with a map and compass. Not to mention noise and light discipline! The section is also missing a Bren gunner.  Mules are a nice touch, but the scenery is obviously a set.  Those who act like tough guys end up the coward.  Lawrence Harvey has a streak of humanity which is refreshing, where as Richard Harris is simply a bore.  Richard Todd was actually in the Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, so he was a war veteran. Plenty of bigotry between the Scots, Welsh, and English.  The section only needed a Paddy or two and they would have been all there.",1373414400,,618,4.385964912280702
8234801,5,B000Z63Z6A,this is a great movie with alot of up and coming actors and with some suspencefull drama for its time period.,1368230400,2,109,4.238095238095238
8234802,4,B000Z63Z6A,"Great cast, interesting twist at the end. Does David McCallum intend to age someday?  I saw this on Million Dollar Movie and couldn't find a copy for a long time.",1366156800,2,162,4.4
