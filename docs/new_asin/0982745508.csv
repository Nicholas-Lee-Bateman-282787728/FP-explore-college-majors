4337634,1,0982745508,"This is excellent propaganda.  The writers use interviews rather than reviewing actual doctrine and dogma.  For instance, several people interviewed refered to Mary as a mediator, but the Roman Catholic Church actually says,

""It would be better, however, to restrict the word mediation to the action of Christ, and intercession to the action of the Blessed Virgin, the angels, and the saints.""

and further,

""If the Apostles and Martyrs, while still in the body, can pray for others, at a time when they must still be anxious for themselves, how much more after their crowns, victories, and triumphs are won! One man, Moses, obtains from God pardon for six hundred thousand men in arms; and Stephen, the imitator of the Lord, and the first martyr in Christ, begs forgiveness for his persecutors; and shall their power be less after having begun to be with Christ? The Apostle Paul declares that two hundred three score and sixteen souls, sailing with him, were freely given him; and, after he is dissolved and has begun to be with Christ, shall he close his lips, and not be able to utter a word in behalf of those who throughout the whole world believed at his preaching of the Gospel? And shall the living dog Vigilantius be better than that dead lion? (""Contra Vigilant."", n. 6, in P. L., XXIII, 344).""

4337637,5,0982745508,"Excellent vdeo. It truly depicts the crisis that the catholic church is going through in modern times. The core of the crisis is the fact that the Church itself has deviated from the sound doctrine found in Scripture. There are a lot of man made doctrines which are not only non biblical but also anti biblical. It is quite clear that the members of the catholic church (or at least most of them) are not covered with the Holy Spirit. The idea alone that the Pope is infallible in matters of doctrine is a joke, specially when this concept has been proved wrong several times. You have Popes contradicting each other even in modern times. Pope John Paul II was an anti communist, while Francis I is pro communism. The list goes on and it is so vast that several books could be written about everything wrong with the roman catholic church. Watch this video since it's an eye opening experience.

4337639,4,0982745508,"Catholicism: Crisis of Faith (1991) presents the contrasts between Catholic doctrines and the Bible from an Evangelical perspective. The film is directed by ex-Catholic, James G. McCarthy, who also wrote the excellent, ""The Gospel According to Rome: Comparing Catholic Tradition and the Word of God"" (Harvest House, 1995), which examines the same material in much greater detail.

This documentary is perfect for Catholics (most of whom have only an extremely shallow understanding of their church's teachings and the Bible) or for Christians who want to understand the basic beliefs of Catholicism and how they compare to the Bible. The film's production techniques (as well as the outfits and hairstyles of the participants) are a bit dated but the message is timeless.

One of the interviewees is Bart Brewer, ex-priest and former director of Mission to Catholics, who went home to be with the Lord in 2003.

Roman Catholics are taught their church is the ""one true church"" but they would be surprised to learn that many Catholic doctrines either disagree with or can't be found in God's Word, the Bible. The most important spiritual matter in which the Catholic Church and the Bible disagree is salvation. The Catholic Church teaches salvation comes through receiving the ""sacraments"" administered by its clergy and by obeying the Ten Commandments and a myriad of church rules and regulations documented in the official Catholic ""catechism."" In contrast, the New Testament teaches no one can possibly earn their way to Heaven but salvation comes freely to those who accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

""There is none righteous, not even one."" Romans 3:10
""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23
""For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" Romans 6:23
""For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."" Ephesians 2:8-9
""For there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."" 1 Timothy 2:5

4337645,4,0982745508,"I own this video (purchased it a few years ago).  Though it's dated it remains an excellence resource, although I'm quite sure many Catholics will disagree.  While some of the complaints have merit in that some of editing work is a little sloppy in places, the overall examination is fair and accurate.  As for the critics, I've noticed that the same complaints seem to surface any time ANY anti-Catholic video or writing come out and the complaints are virtually always the same.

As for myself, I prefer not to identify myself as a ""Protestant"" in terms of ""religious affiliation"", though I agree with many Protestant viewpoints concerning exegesis of Scripture and criticism of false religions, like Roman Catholicism.  I left the organized institutional church system about 10 years ago (at the time of this writing) and there are many things about modern day ""Protestantism"" that I disagree with and find un-biblical and un-Christlike.  I also agree that there are occasions where Protestants misrepresent elements of Catholic doctrine because of their own ignorance.  I mention this detail about my own ""exodus"" from institutional Christianity only to convey that I am not speaking on behalf of any specific religious group or denomination.  My perspective is that a relationship with Jesus Christ has nothing to do with submission to some man-made religious order or denomination.  The only thing that is essential is genuine faith in Jesus Christ who is the only Way, Truth and Life!  No one comes to the Father except through Him.  No church organization is needed to birth, manage or mediate this relationship that God Himself brings into being.  When a person's heart is lit with the spark of faith in Christ and that person believes His Gospel and sets his course to follow Jesus, they are made a living stone in the household of Faith and are members of the Family of God, which is the only Church.  It matters not whether someone joins some other group (i.e. church organization).  He whom the Son of God sets free is FREE INDEED!

As a follower of Jesus, I love my Catholic friends as well as and as much as my Protestant friends.  That doesn't mean I have to accept unbiblical doctrines and why should I be hated for choosing to believe the Bible only?  My decision is not one that is intended to slander any person, call them stupid, or any such nonsense.  It is God's place to convict of sin and error.  I believe the Bible and have my own relationship with God.  For me, that trumps any other flight or fancy of religion and I am quite happy to be free of the anxiety created by organized religion.  Protestants are fond of saying things like, ""You gotta hate the sin just not the sinner.""  I think I've seen more than one bumper sticker like that...  Fair enough... But they often get bitterly angry and act very unloving toward folks like me (or even other Catholics and members of other denominations) who disregard many of their cherished traditions, which have no designation of Scripture and are full of error and they don't really seem to know how to love whom they designate as ""the sinner"" and separate that from the so-called ""sin"".  I think the same is true for many Catholics who are angered by people who are vocal about their disagreements with Catholic doctrine.

To each of these groups I say, ""If you can hate the sin but not the sinner, then I can hate the beliefs but not the believer.""  Since the topic here is Roman Catholicism, YES, I hate the beliefs!  There is an interesting little video out (you can probably find it on YouTube) called The Catholic Inquisition and the Torture Tools.  I don't care who you are or what your religious background, if you can regard the absolute fact that for over 600 years the Roman Catholic church routinely TORTURED and killed many millions of people because they did not agree with the Pope and then still think that your religion is sanctioned by God, I have no idea what to say to you.  If there was any clear evidence of something being so satanic and twisted in terms of religion, this is a mountain of the most incredible evidence imaginable!  I don't care if some recent Pope ""apologized"" for this... That just means he's maybe a little smarter or more compassionate than the last guy, but the fact is that the Pope (which includes ALL of them throughout history) is regarded as the authority and voice of Christ on earth, so regardless of the present organization's position on the matter, this organization's leadership (for nearly a thousand years) declared that it was God's direct and personal will to gruesomely maim, torture, and murder people who simply chose a different opinion; who chose to follow Jesus outside the confines of the Catholic religion.  How is this any worse than a terrorist who kills in the name of their god?  It is no different!  They took people's money, confiscated their writings, imprisoned, tortured and slandered family members - all in the name of Christ!  In my view, they have more than earned the title of false religion and devilish doctrine!  I am not suggesting that all Catholics are devilish or ill-intent.  I believe many (possibly the majority) are sincere and desire to be right with God.  If you are a Catholic, please don't judge me as being just another Protestant who is anti-Catholic.  There really is no hatred intended here at all.  Rather, consider me as a person who believes in the one true God of the Bible and the Gospel and character of Jesus as demonstrated in the Bible - and therefore who thusly must disregard any group or teaching that deviates from this example and doctrine.  God's love and truth as demonstrated and taught in Scripture by Christ and His Apostles (as well as the relationship I enjoy personally with Him), convicts me to accept no alternative gospel or religious frame of mind.

I am so happy to be free of RELIGION!  At least ""religion"" as the world thinks of it.  My relationship with God is mediated ONLY by Christ Jesus as Scripture teaches - not as some other church invents.  My friendship with God is afforded by the grace of God through the FINISHED work of Jesus who died for my sins and rose from the grave to make me FREE INDEED!  I am no longer bound by any man's religious dictate.  I care not for the threats and judgments that are imposed by so much religious legalism.  In Christ I am free!  I am loved by God!  I am brought in to His family by the precious blood of Jesus!  I am not disqualified because I reject man-made doctrines of ""infant baptism"", the Mass, Marian worship, or ""Holy Eucharist"" distortions.  I don't need a priest to commune with my father; nor do I need prayer beads, statues, pennants, patron saints, rote prayers, or any of that silly religious voodoo.  I have JESUS!  What wondrous liberation and joy!  What pure happiness!  What genuine deliverance and relief!

I thank God that so many people are discovering this truth and no longer being intimidated by religious control - no matter what denominational influence has previously been in dominance.  Sometimes organized religion gets a few details right, but true Christianity is not about some organization imposing its legalism to legislate morality and manage external behavior...  True Christianity is about the Gospel of Jesus and the living power of the Holy Spirit, which transforms mens' hearts from darkness to light and changes their very nature into a new creation!  In other words, true Christianity is all about a personal relationship with God DIRECTLY and it is HE who changes us from the inside out.  This is REAL transformation!  The apostle Paul said that if he actuated every form of religion imaginable but had not love it was worthless noise and nothing of value at all!!!!!  People do NOT need more religion...  They NEED GOD!  Once a relationship with Jesus exists at the center, then ""true religion"" takes place, which is action orchestrated entirely by love and motivated by grace and obedience through DIRECT communication with the Lord - NOT through some external force of religious legalism!

Religion may do a decent job in society, at times, of attempting to manage external behavior (and perhaps the Catholic Church will win some points here - in light of some of the charitable works they may do)... but they cannot guarantee salvation by these works and they have NO power to change the heart!  Therefore, membership to such an organization is irrelevant to salvation and completely non-essential!  Many different religions exercise ""Christ-like"" actions, but are VOID of Truth and can still leave a soul bound for hell.  Only Christ Jesus has the power to save and He doesn't need any religious system to do it!

This video is great because it declares freedom through only Christ!  If it were to emphasize church attendance in some Protestant denomination, I would speak critically of it as well.  The answer is Jesus, not more religion.  Catholicism (in this writer's observation) is built on a history of distorted teachings that frequently deviate from the teachings of Christ and is, in my opinion, fraught with demonic concepts and practices sanctioned by many Popes and religious princes.  The little bit of truth does not make up for the mountain of error!  For all of its physical beauty through its fancy edifices and meticulously-actuated rituals, these things do not make it any more true, righteous or beneficial.  Jesus himself told His disciples when they marveled at the Temple and all its beauty that not one stone would be left upon another.  God isn't impressed with grand church buildings, gold and silver, purple robes and elaborate rituals.  He is impressed only with faith from a sincere and contrite heart.  Regardless of the fact that many devout Catholics will be angered by the presentation of this video and the derogatory light it puts on Catholicism, any one with a mind to study ACTUAL history will find that the doctrines that are exposed in this video have been actually taught by the Catholic Church!  I hope many people will continue to leave it behind in favor of a genuine relationship with Christ alone!  Then they will find a true place in the body of Christ that is not qualified by anything other than Christ alone!  I pray that more and more people will discover that the true Church of Jesus Christ is not a denomination or sect of organized religion... it is not a religious edifice... and certainly not the grand Roman Catholic Church or any other, but it is a spiritual assembly in Christ Jesus!  It is comprised of all the souls of those who belong to Him by faith; having been sealed by the Holy Spirit and united by the one and only Gospel of Jesus that Scripture so simply presents.

Yes, these are MY opinions based on my personal convictions of Scripture and my relationship with Jesus.  I am not a member of any organized church or denomination.  I have no ill heart towards the members of any group whether Protestant or Catholic.  My heart is to follow only the Truth and my salvation rests in Christ alone.  God bless!  May His love surround you and His truth set you free!",1337299200,15,11128,4.765535248041775

Many of the claims in the video are outlandish, but that's why I decided to find out for myself, with lots of time spent reading scriptures, studying the early church fathers and the writings by many protestant ministers who became Catholic (Scott Hahn, Marcus Grodi, Thomas Howard, Francis Beckwith, Steve Ray).

This video was a shock to me because McCarthy didn't take the time to find out what Catholics really believe. It's only goal seemed to be Catholic bashing. It implied several things that we don't believe. Such as thinking a statue could make it stop raining, Mary being a co-saviour with Jesus (that's absolutely not anything like what we believe), that Jesus' sacrifice is not finished (we believe his sacrifice is once and for all), that we try to re-sacrifice him (he said ""do this in memory of me), that we ommitted the second commandment at some point in time, that we worship statues like Romans did their gods ( we use statues only in the way God says is good in Numbers 21: 8-10, 2 Kings 18:4, 1 Kings 6: 23-36. God isn't opposed to images when used for the proper purpose, only when worshipped as a God.  In Chronicles 28:18  God ordained there be statues of Cherubim over the Arc of the Covenant.  Galatians 3:1 has the Galatians looking at a crucifix.

I respect my Protestant friends who genuinely want to know what I believe and ask me, but this is an example of a person twisting what Catholics believe or not informing themselves.

I know my faith, and this movie really doesn't.

If you really want to know what Catholics believe and why, I'd suggest any of these books. One of the most important questions we can ask is ""what does the Bible say?""

4337654,5,0982745508,"This is a must see video for all Catholics. Although I saw this long after I left the Catholic church, I wish I saw this earlier.",1261008000,8,129,4.0
4337655,1,0982745508,"I have watched this erroneous video and I have also heard one of the priests who were interviewed in this documentary.  I heard his side and what really happened.  For instance, he who was taken way out of context... he was interviewed for long periods of time and then the tape only used short clips and spliced them together to make him sound ignorant about god and about his faith.  They even asked him the 'same' question many times over and over again, making him repeat himself.  So, frustrated after the 3rd, 4th, or 5th time, he answered, ""I don't know what else to say"", or ""there's nothing I can add to that.""  At this point, the video producers take 'those' lines and insert them  after juicy questions to make it seem like the priest has no answers and can't answer the objections... but that is not the truth of what happened.  Rather, they put the priest in a bad light intentionally.  It's very dishonest and unprofessional.
  I have at least 3  typed pages of errors for this documentary, and they are horrendous.  If you would like to see and know more, read on down below.  If not, then I recommend quality Catholic, unbiased literature and Video.  If you really want to know what Catholics believe, you can by the talk: ""Why Be Catholic?"" by Tim Staples, or can read ""Catholicism Vs. Fundamentalism"" by Karl Keating.  These are truthful representations of Catholicism from an unbiased point of view.

FOR THOSE WHO CARE AND WANT MORE..... Here are a couple of the major errors in this video.  There are many more:

#1.  One of my biggest problems: The documentary that I saw stated, ""Catholics have confused Mary's role with Christ's,"" and then shows ""Mary"" nailed to a cross.  This is a 'huge' issue.  The person on the cross in question is not Mary, but a Saint from Ecuador whose father actually did crucify her.  I have ""heard"" that this part has been taken out of later videos, yet the fact that this grave error was in there in the first place is both concerning and disheartening.  This is such a huge blunder, and it seriously damages the credibility of the documentary.

#2.  It was stated that Catholics don't use St. Christopher any more, that they just scratched him as a saint.  This is not true.  St. Christopher's spot on the Roman calendar has been updated by more recent and more well known saints, but that's not the same as discarding him, saying that he's no longer a saint.  Big difference.

#3.  Another point made in the documentary: ""The belief that there was a change in the bread was not invented until 1215 AD. - This was the first time the church sanctioned that theory?""
  1215?  There is unanimous consent of the true presence of the Eucharist back until the earliest days of Christianity, certainly before 1215 AD.  this is just flat out wrong. 2 examples among countless:
  St. Athanasius (373 A.D.):  But after the great and wonderful prayers have been completed, then the bread is become the body, and the wine the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. ... This bread and wine, so long as the prayers and supplications have not taken place, remain simply what they are.  But, after the great prayers and supplications have been sent forth, the Word comes down into the bread and wine - and thus is His body confected.
  Justin Martyr (Around 150AD)- ""We call this food Eucharist, and no one else is permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true and who has been washed in the washing which is for the remission of sins and for regeneration [i.e., has received baptism] and is thereby living as Christ enjoined. For not as common bread nor common drink do we receive these; but since Jesus Christ our Savior was made incarnate by the word of God and had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so too, as we have been taught, the food which has been made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him, and by the change of which our blood and flesh is nurtured, is both the flesh and the blood of that incarnated Jesus."" (emphasis mine)

And there are many more ...",1254960000,30,4056,4.562326869806094

4337657,1,0982745508,"There is nothing to be gained by such an anti- Catholic video.
In using small sound bytes and overly edited interviews this video seeks to show the ""truths"" of the Catholic Faith.
The truth of the film is that James McCarthy, is a disgruntled former Catholic, who today he is a Fundamentalist minister who describes the Catholic Church and its teachings as ""an insult to the finished work of Christ.""
If you want to know the truth about Catholic teaching-- this is not the film for you.",1214179200,26,486,4.597701149425287
4337658,1,0982745508,Too much propaganda for me.  If the interviews were presented unedited it would make this film completely different.  There are also mistakes made that the producer has acknowledged but refused to remove them.  Those who watch this should take it upon themselves to really look into the claims made about Catholicism.,1212537600,13,317,5.176470588235294
4337659,4,0982745508,"This DVD is a serious product without the humor or the desire to cap on the interviewees of a Michael Moore or Ben Stein production.  It shows the differences between Catholicism and Biblical Christianity. Some of the differences would apply to Protestant religions so the DVD could be used to understand Christian doctrine for a general audience.

Although doctrinal in nature there are interesting sidelights for the casual watcher.  For instance a priest points out how the Catholic Church gives a matriarchal aspect to Christianity. A Christian, apparently, who is a Catholic is interviewed to the surprise of the producers (they left the interview in for us to experience as well).

Subjects covered in part are the Mass, Statues/Saints, Mary, Sacraments, Purgatory and Salvation. Because this is a doctrinally based DVD, so-called historical moral failures of Popes or pedophelia are not discussed.  If you do not have time to read books on Catholicism and the Bible this DVD will give you an excellent overview. Be careful as it may encourage you to dig deeper into this important area.",1211241600,9,1093,5.117977528089888

4337661,4,0982745508,"I believe this video takes an honest look at how the teaching of the Catholic Church compares to what the Bible says.  In many cases they do not seem to be saying the same thing.  I didn't see anything that was considered to be critical of the Catholic Church as NOT being directly from their official doctrines, or the direct experience of those interviewed, many of whom were, or still are members of the Catholic Church.  I think anyone serious about knowing if the Catholic Church's teachings are consistent with Biblical Christianity owes it to themselves to watch this video.",1211155200,12,581,4.79
4337662,5,0982745508,"This video loving presents the errors of the roman religion (a.k.a. Catholic church.)  It does not bash, but gently pulls back the veil and proves (with mounds of documentation and commentary by former priests and nuns who have now come to a true and saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus) that the Roman religion was corrupted by political influences and that most of the doctrines surrounding Mary, communion and the doctrine of the church are false - hold overs from the medievel period.

4337664,1,0982745508,"James McCarthy created this film with one intent: incorporate as much bigoted propaganda into his time frame as possible.

For an example, take note that the camera will focus on a woman on a cross. The narrator will imply that Catholics believe it was Mary who died for our sins, and not Jesus. In reality, the camera was focusing on a crucifix of Santa Liberata, a woman who was crucified by her father for refusing to marry a corrupt, pagan prince.

4337665,5,0982745508,"This video is incredible.  As a former catholic, it took me over two years the hard way to learn much of what is summed up in such a thorough and well cited way in this one hour video.  I can confidently say that anyone that criticizes this video has yet to refer to the scriptures that they are referencing in the video which go against Catholic doctrine.  As a former Catholic I am fully aware of the pride and bias that Catholics have for all other denominations, I mean your faith is part heritage.  However, from one past catholic to those that are still in the catholic church I plead with you to watch this video multiple times with a CCC with you and a Bible and to compare the two.  While tradition is good to some extent, if it contradicts THE WORD OF GOD then we have some real problems.  Please please please investigate this for yourself by reading the bible.  I spent  over 20 active years in the Catholic church and like so many was guilty of never reading the bible, ohhhhh what a mistake that was.",1171584000,13,1014,4.328042328042328

I wanted to convert my wife to the Catholic religion.  She asked me, ""What do they believe?""  Since I wasn't as stong in my Catholic faith as I should have been, I said, ""You know, let's take a look together.""  We took a Catechism and started looking through it.  We could not believe what we saw! Many, many things contradicted the Bible.  From changing the 10 commandments, to no mention of Prugatory, to not really knowing where I was going when I died. I could seriously write a book about all the things that differ from the Bible.
I am now trying to bring my entire family out of the spiritual fog of the Catholic church. This video is the key, if Catholics see this video and do not RUN from the Catholic chuch, then they need to figure out who they want to serve, Man's traditions and doctrines OR the written word of GOD. When the Catholic Catechism is a bigger book than the bible, and that book is not totally judged by the Bible, look out for serious deviations from the word of God.  There is only one way to God, and that is through Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for our sins, and to give us everlasting life.  All that is required is that we ask him to come in to our life.

My wife has been an RCC elementary school teacher for 33 years. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior 32 years ago.  This video has been around for many, many years, before there was DVD. It was originally n VHS tape.  That's when I first saw it. This video is 100% accurate when it first came out.  However, to address the many, many issues and contradictions to Scripture, many Catholic churches teach, as my wife has been brainwashed into believing, that the Bible IS NOT the Word of God, that it was written AND authored by man! The only real truth comes from the traditions of the RCC and what the RCC teaches.. This heresy voids any conflict with God's Word. Is it any wonder, why all the negative reviews of this video are from Catholics?  When I get so frustrated with my wife, God reminds me: 2 Corinthians 4:4, ""In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. ""  SATAN HAS BLINDED THEIR MINDS!  Of course Catholics are going to vehemently deny this video.  Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc., etc. would also vehemently deny attacks against their religion.  In fact, Muslims will put out a contract to kill you, as they have done so many times in the past.

I give this video 4 stars, because the video quality isn't all that great, because it came from VHS. I am ecstatically happy that the Holy Spirit opened my eyes to God's truth and removed me from the RCC cult.
