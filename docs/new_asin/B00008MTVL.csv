1854147,5,B00008MTVL,A real legend. Not only in Nw Orleans but all over the world. A great DVD recorded during the Jazz and Heritage Festivall in 1991. I was there and remember the whole show. It was a good one. Fats at his best. Age does not count. One thing should have been better: the sound quality. For a 2001 product i am really disapointed. I hope we will have another chance to see and hear Fats in a quality he and all of his fans deserve for the future. Give Fats and his fans a better Chance before it is too late!,1065398400,17,504,4.0
1854148,5,B00008MTVL,"Sony/Shout has delivered a first-rate piece of entertainment and education: Fats Domino at the 2001 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. We are treated to twenty full performances - the only medley is the closer. In fact, there are terrific renditions of lesser-discussed classics like ""Girl I Love"" [aka ""Help Me""], ""Don't You Know"", ""All By Myself"", ""Poor Me"", and ""So Long"". The cameras are right there to vividly capture the Hall of Famer at the mike and keys while picking up alot of the happy patrons dancing and singing along. The editing is exceptionally good - most videos/DVDs feature hyperactive camerawork focusing only only what's happening *on* stage.
Informative interviews with New Orleans musician/producer/arranger Allen Toussaint, J & M Studios Founder/producer/engineer Cosimo Matawassa, the Nevilles, Mikal Gilmore, and Antoine himself are beautifully interpolated. The Bio'(s) and Disgoraphy are a little short on detail but overall this is essential stuff.",1053907200,34,980,5.54
1854149,5,B00008MTVL,"Fats never looked or sounded better.  The band sounds tight and it's a fun concert to watch.  If you are a Fats Domino fan this is a DVD you will want to own.  My only complaint and I even hate to bring it up, but you may want to know that several of the songs are faded out for personal remarks made by people in the music bizz.  Other than that I love the DVD!",1053475200,8,362,3.7866666666666666
1854150,5,B00008MTVL,"Fats Domino is a sound that boomed over the radio as I was growing up. Although I was quite young, I was 6 years old when Ain't  That  A Shame was a hit, it had that sound that stuck with you. I always enjoyed his music, it probably the reason that I embraced straight a head jazz many years later. That bluesy edge. Fats Domino had an impact on many musicians over the decades, so I needed to go back home, so to speak. Reviewers that found him almost exactly like they heard it before, they were correct. He delivered each one of his hits like a teacher reads the answers to his own test. I thought I was back in 1955. We are so lucky to have this DVD recorded in 2001 to hear history in the making in color and with modern video production values. There are so many great ones that never were recorded on film for posterity. Thank you Fats",1450396800,,842,4.128048780487805

1854155,5,B00008MTVL,"Fats Domino is the greatest rock & roll singer/wrighter IMHO. The song were easy to understant, easy to dance to,.
Just good simple music with a great beat that I still enjoy to this day",1345939200,,186,4.3428571428571425

1854157,5,B00008MTVL,"My purchase was made at Amazon. My expectations of this DVD were high and I wasn't disappointed. Adding the horn section was a real plus. The 5.1 surround audio is fantastic. Like many other fans, I followed Fats from the beginning of Rock & Roll. His style and performance has remained consistent throughout the years and is expressed well on this DVD. Not only is Fats performing as one would expect but the musicians are preforming in their own way expressing their love for ""The Fat Man"" and his music. What better setting for this performance than  Fats Domino's home town of New Orleans. I've heard mention that a word or two would drop off toward the end of a few verses. This is actually consistent with the Fats Domino style not changing. In the 50's most all microphones were omni-directional and would pick up all sound. The advent of total directional microphones eliminated unwanted sound but requires the singer stay in front of the mic. If you notice the stand up mic for Fats Domino remains consistent being placed to his right as he would play, he would turn to the right and deliver the vocals. Fats delivered a knock out performance of ""The Fat Man' my personal favorite.

If your a Fats Domino fan and don't have this DVD in your collection, your missing something real special.",1342915200,,1298,4.663755458515284
1854158,3,B00008MTVL,"this review may sound like a broken record but no one has said anything about all the interviews spliced throughout this concert. if i wanted interviews i'd go to the library and check out a book about his life. there seems to be a need to tell a story instead of enjoying a complete concert without interviews. put them in the bonus section not throughout the concert. how many times are you gonna want to watch this dvd and have his life shoved dowm your throats. let the viewer make that decision or at least put a statement on the box alerting the consumer that the interviews are throughout the concert. if you can deal with all the interviews then you'll probley enjoy the concert. for me it ruined the concert. if i need a ""fats fix"" in the future, i'll put on the austin city limits show. no interviews.........",1305158400,8,819,4.466666666666667
1854159,5,B00008MTVL,"This is a definitive video of the most meaningful works of the true King of Rock n' Roll.  We know the songs, and the King sings them as we know them.  No fancy endings, no grandstanding...just the music as we expect it.  Thank you Fats, and rock on!",1281916800,,250,4.166666666666667

1854162,4,B00008MTVL,"Anyone who has been to the Jazz Fest will appreciate the vibes this DVD creates.  The party atmosphere definately comes through.  The crowd is mostly ""boomers"" but there are some younger faces too.  The video and audio are very good.  I reduced the rating by one star for the ""tailing off"" of quite a few songs into the interviews.  Also, Fats has a habit of turning away from the microphone on the last two or three words of the song.  Fats has still got it and the accompanying 4 man horn section really adds punch.  This is how it should be done.  Enjoy!!!",1258675200,,559,4.359223300970874
1854163,5,B00008MTVL,"I grew up and went to high school when Fats Dominio was as popular as Elvis. This music is unique because i like the style ""fats"" has. If this music doesn't make you feel happy and want to start dancing then i doubt if anything would.""The Legends Of New Orleans-The Music of Fats Domino"" is a DVD that i will enjoy playing many times to come. I also like the way it shows the audience and the people having a good time.",1248048000,,419,4.121951219512195
1854164,5,B00008MTVL,"If you are a Fats Domino fan this is a music video to own. If you choose having only a single DVD by Fats you won't regret this being the one. Has his greatest songs with unbelievable sound & video quality. I often agonize when choosing a music DVD, sometimes being wrong, but this was money well spent.",1232928000,,303,4.241379310344827
1854165,5,B00008MTVL,I highly recommend The Music of Fats Domino. Each year I select a CD/DVD to give to family and friends. This year was Fats. Everyone loved it. I kept one for myself and will listen to it often.,1199318400,,193,4.105263157894737
1854166,5,B00008MTVL,"I have a number of Fats Domino concerts, but this is the best one I have. The sound, Dolby 5.1, and picture quality is great, and the camera work takes you right in to the concert, as if you were there.",1197504000,,202,3.951219512195122
1854167,5,B00008MTVL,"Living in Europe I had to buy a multi region DVD player to view this video as it is not available for the European area.

It was well worth doing so.

I have seen Fats perform in concert many many times in Dublin, but unfortunately he never comes over to Ireland now.

This DVD brings all the excitement of one of his conceerts right into the living room and is a reminder that he was still a great artist at the time it was made in 2007.  Picturer quality and the sound of the concert was excellent.

Anybody who has nostalgic feelings about the bonanza era of rock n roll in the fifties would do well to purchase this DVD.",1178928000,,624,4.166666666666667
1854168,5,B00008MTVL,this is one of the best dvd's that i own . fats domino is a legend . this is definitely with a doubt a five star product .,1169424000,2,122,3.392857142857143
1854169,5,B00008MTVL,"A lot of artists just seem to lose their touch as they get older. I kind of expected that with Fats on this DVD set. After all, he IS in his 70's now.

But I couldn't have been more wrong.

From the first tinkle of the piano keys, I knew right away that Fats was back in the house! Even his voice sounded just like it did way back when he was a chart-topper.

If you like Fats' music, you're going to love this DVD! One hit after another after another. The sound is great! The picture is sharp!

With as many hits as Fats has had, it's next to impossible to play everything in one concert. But he picks a great batch of songs from his catalog and he doesn't disappoint!

Here's a list of songs he plays in the ""show"":

1. I'm Walkin'

2. Let The Four Winds Blow

3. My Blue Heaven

4. I'm In Love Again

5. I'm Ready

6. Don't You Know

7. Shake, Rattle and Roll

8. Blueberry Hill

9. Girl I Love

10. Blue Monday

11. Poor Me

12. All By Myself

13. So-Long

14. When My Dreamboat Comes Home

15. I'm Gonna Be a Wheel Someday

16. The Fat Man

17. My Girl Josephine

18. Goin' To The River

19. Walking to New Orleans

20. When the Saints Go Marching In / Sentimental Journey
