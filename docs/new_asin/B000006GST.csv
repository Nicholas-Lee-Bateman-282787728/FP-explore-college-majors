1193808,5,B000006GST,"I waited for this film on DVD for years; apparently the people at the studio have no idea how important a piece of gay history this film really is.

There is no denying that Boys in the Band is controversial.  Among gay men, it seems to provoke either fierce defense or intense outrage.  Indeed, there seem to be just as many people who praise it for its honesty, humor and status as a ground-breaking film, as there are people who condemn it for its stereotypes and self-hating negative images.  There seems to be no middle ground.  Many people who know me well might be surprised to find that I am one of its defenders.

Although I was only 16 years old in 1970, I was already totally ""out"" as a gay person in most aspects of my life.  As such, I had heard about this film (but couldn't get in to see it) almost as soon as it came out.  But you can bet I acquired a copy of the play shortly thereafter, and what I found thrilled me.  Yes, ""thrilled"" is the only way to describe my initial reaction to The Boys in the Band.  I guess when you're used to being totally ignored, having your life acknowledged, even in a negative way, can be surprisingly positive.

First of all, BITB was the first mainstream Hollywood film whose main subject matter was homosexuality; that in itself was a giant step forward.  In 1970, depictions of gay men in Hollywood movies were unheard of, unless we were presented as swishy stereotypes or evil predators.  And yes, that's precisely what the controversy is about - back in 1970, as today, many gay men felt that Boys in the Band presented nothing more than a rehash of the same, tired stereotypes that Hollywood have been foisting on us for years.  But I am not at all sure that I agree.

After a superficial look, you will find that The Boys in the Band contains several characters that do not fit the description of stereotypes or negative portrayals.  In fact, if one overlooks the characters of Michael (self-hating, bitchy, self-destructive) and Emory (swishy, swishy, SWISHY) the characters in Boys in the Band are about as positive as one could expect for 1970.  And for all his limp-wristed excess, the character of Emory is ultimately presented as forthright, honest and tough.  For several years following the birth of gay liberation, a lot of gay men wanted to pretend that people like Emory didn't exist.  Now we know - or should know, anyway, that some people (even some straight people) don't fit the mold of what society has come to expect from their born gender.  Aren't we supposed to be enlightened enough to know that people have the right to be who they are?  Yes, there are gay AND straight men who are every bit as effeminate as Emory.  I have met quite a few of them in my day.  So what?
A lot of us seem to forget what it was like for us in those days.  In the Pre-stonewall world of the 1960's when Boys in the Band was written, many gay men swallowed the heterosexual propaganda that gay people were mentally ill, unstable, or just plain weird.  In fact, early homophile meetings were often consumed by debates on whether or not the psychiatric community was correct in labeling us as sick.  It should therefore not be surprising that yes, some of the dialogue is certainly outdated; thank goodness gay men no longer waste time on endless analysis, absorbing psycho-babble about why we are ""that way"", and wasting even more time re-hashing and debating the same drivel with their friends in an efforts to justify our existence.  But in 1970, we DID debate these things, and we DID think that way, because mainstream society spent so much time cramming us into closets and demonizing our very existence.  But we had to start somewhere, and if nothing else, The Boys in the Band is a startling reminder of how far we've come.  Up until the time the film was released (and to some extent, even today) much of the heterosexual world tried to convince us that we are deranged, child-molesting sociopaths, hell-bound and totally immoral.  And guess what?  Far too many of us listened to the lies, and a great many of us were damaged by it.  These are the roots of internalized homophobia, and the characters in The Boys in the Band are, in a very real sense, accurate depictions of the results of decades (if not centuries) of society-sanctioned homophobia.  At the time the play was written, there were a lot of gay men who did resemble the characters in it (I know; I was one of them).  Rather than being embarrassed at the mess society wrought on some of our psyches, we should be proud that so many of us have been able to overcome decades of repression.

And yes, the theme in The Boys in the Band is frequently overlooked by its critics.  Michael's closing speech in the play, ""If only we could learn not to hate ourselves quite so much"" is a powerful indictment and, dare I say, revolutionary rebuttal to the self-absorbed indifference that characterized much of the gay community prior to 1970.  And the overall message (which I heard loud and clear in 1970) is that we (gay men) must realize that we are not the sickos that some portions of society wants us to think we are, and we must come to terms with exactly who we are without reservation before we can ever hope to make any progress.

In the end, I know this much - I saw the off-Broadway revival of the stage version of The Boys in the Band in 1996, and the audience was composed almost entirely of gay men.  The laughter was loud and frequent, and the abundant applause made it clear that many in the modern gay audience recognized themselves or their friends among the characters presented, even if only as pieces of nostalgia.  Self-hating?  Yes, sometimes to a painful degree.  But learning to love yourself in a world where so many people condemn your very existence is a life-long process, and Boys in the Band is nothing more or less than a reminder of where some of us came from, and how very far we've come.

The Blu-Ray Edition of Boys in the Band contains the same extra features as the DVD.  There is an audio commentary by the Director, William Friedkin (who later directed The Exorcist) and a three-part featurette.  Go ahead pick up a piece of gay history, and prepare to laugh at loud.",1466726400,4,6225,4.533572068039391

1193814,5,B000006GST,"I found out about this movie after reading Vito Russo's 'Celluloid Closet"". Its a fascinating piece of film making. Anyone watching this film has to put it into context. The original play and this film were produced before Stonewall, so the prevailing attitudes about being gay were portrayed in this film. Its also a wonder that such an open film about gay life was even produced in an era when homosexuality was still taboo. So this film was groundbreaking. The movie was made just like the play, which is great because it stayed true to the original work. The writing and acting performances were done very well. The material will be perceived today as depressing and demoralizing but its a good representation of how difficult gay life was. Reviewing films like Boys decades later shows how far our society has come with gay acceptance. Unfortunately, five of the cast members died of AIDS.

1193815,4,B000006GST,"This film is a classic. I regret I was a bit young to go see the play, but I did see the film as a teen!  And it's basically a stage play rendered on film.  Time has now returned this play/film to its rightful place as a STILL timely piece.
Self hate, self doubts, relationships, loyalty in friendship despite everything,  haven't gone away.
If anything this play was the first I know of to confirm and support gay identity.

No archival interviews with now deceased actors are included.  Were they never asked or interviewed about this film? Not even Cliff Gorman
who was very successful after this film and appeared on late night talk shows. Always confirming he wasn't gay.

1193860,1,B000006GST,"Groundbreaking director D.W. Griffth's silent classic Birth of a Nation portrays the KKK as heroes, saving white Christian American womanhood from the inexorably impulsive & deviant sexuality of black men: should it remain widely available? Or Triumph of the Will, the documentary of Nuremberg rallies by Nazi director Leni Riefenstahl?

Both are historically important. Even if many (perhaps most) people--in 2015, anyway--find the subject matter repellent.

This film is in a similar category; its influential status reinforced pernicious stereotypes. In this instance--particularly if one looks at films made prior to the Stonewall rebellion--we can find countless examples of far more outrageous calumnies. Cinematic history mirrors the history of societal attitudes toward homosexuality: once a crime, later regarded a disease, then described in condescending tones of pity, or (this was progress!) a mere ""preference.""

Fictional portrayals affect our lives but also reflect them. Not so many decades ago LGBT people could be involuntarily institutionalized--to prevent ""harming themselves and others."" The therapies included electroshock and lobotomy: widespread, punitive human experimentation--sorry, I meant ""medical care""--to prevent perversion from spreading to others. As if romantic and sexual attraction to one's own gender were a communicable disease.

The Supreme Court having recently granted a Constitutional right to same-sex marriage across the nation, it is tempting to declare: no, we haven't merely made progress! why, the battle is over. But except for a handful of cities and states where civil-rights laws have been extended to apply to sexual orientation? Otherwise, those perceived (truthfully or not) as lesbian, gay or transgender can lose their jobs or their homes; no legal recourse is available.

For at least a couple of decades, millions of people--heterosexual, primarily--assumed such protections must surely already be in place. (""Not that I paid much attention; why would I? It doesn't affect MY life."") Thus, zealots effectively wielded the ""no special rights"" slogan to provoke resentment. Wherever such political battles were taken to the ballot, hate crimes increased. Late-night arson as long-time couples slept in their homes. Or groups of young people finding thrills in slowly beating to death anyone seen near the ""gay ghettos.""

Those who produce and direct television commercials wield remarkable skill in manipulating our emotions. Such ""creatives"" are reviled as avaricious. Meanwhile, William Friedkin is praised for being ""sensitive and compassionate,"" or ""ahead of his time,"" or otherwise laudable for creating this influential work. Much as he did in The Exorcist, Friedkin's directorial ""gift""--with agonizing torpor, with the subtlety of dropping anvils on heads--drags audiences through shock for shock's sake.

Some regard Boys in the Band as unintentionally-hilarious camp. This requires a certain emotional distance, which I can't summon. Why not?

Maybe the subjectively endless (OK it was, in fact, ten years) of relentless bullying--both at school, and at home; both intense and frequent. Accompanied by taunts I'm unable to repeat here. Why? Red-flagging of serious analysis and opinion by mindless search algorithms.

After another decade had passed, I lost my closest friend. As a teen he'd been coerced by parents, and by his family doctor--those he most trusted--into submitting to ""reparative therapy."" He took his own life. They must have succeeded in changing (or at least exacerbating) how he felt about himself.",1439769600,,3587,5.727443609022556

And, not only should the film have been nominated, but should've won the SAG Award for Best Ensemble Cast. There is not a weak perfomance in the bunch. The actors play off each other to perfection. Things were pretty tough for gays in the 60's (not saying life's a breeze now, but there have been substantial improvements). And it's the religious and societal brainwashing that teaches homosexuality is evil that lead to the self-loathing that is depicted in the film, which is the main criticism of the film by many. But if the film is viewed as a retrospect of how things were, it is a most entertaining film that could open the eyes of some people, and thus lead to a better understanding and acceptance of others. As for the blu-ray itself, the transfer is superb, one of the best I've seen. Sometimes have the feeling of watching a live performance. The extras are entertaining and enlightening, especially the contibuted insights provided by Friedkin, Crowley, and the two surviving cast members, Lawrence Luckinbill (Mr. Lucie Arnaz), and Peter White.

1193908,1,B000006GST,".... for the Blu-ray transfer.  5 stars for the film.  Yet another sloppy, careless transfer from Kino Lorber.  Why do they even bother?  Answer: to snag fools like me who still expect a quality product.  This seems to be an even worse transfer than the Paramount DVD.  Colors are off and vary from scene to scene - impossible to adjust.  Unbearably grainy and yet serious signs of too much DNR.  I even suspect an aspect issue.  Paramount lists it as 2.25:1.  This transfer is 1.85:1.  The clock is ticking on films like this.  At some point a serious restoration / transfer may not be possible.

1193910,1,B000006GST,"I love the movie, however: the Blu-ray edition is terrible and I agree to 100% to the review on ""Blu-ray Reviews & Releases"" who wrote: ""The AVC encoded image (1.78:1 aspect ratio) presentation doesn't represent a recent HD scan, with filmic qualities failing to spring to life, with grain erratic and periodically unnatural. Contrast has difficulties, especially in the final act of the movie, and delineation is mostly solid, losing dense hairstyles and costuming in limited lighting. Original cinematography favors softness, with details barely emerging even on intense close-ups, while background decoration is difficult to pick out. Colors are emphasized, giving clothing some heft, but skintones are very strange at times, looking more pastel than pinkish. Speckling is detected, along with sporadic debris.""

Therefore, don't waste any money buying the Koch Lorber Blu-Ray. The old DVD was struck from the same master and had the same issues in terms of excessive grain. I know it sounds idiotic (especially in times of digital mastering) the old VHS is better than the DVD and/or blu-ray.

Critique: `Boys in the Band' from '70 was definitely a bold and daring film way ahead of its time. The thought of a movie examining the homosexual psyche in '70 was absolutely unheard of. The American public had enough of a problem just contemplating the thought of a gay lifestyle, let alone deal with a storyline that not only examined the prejudice found in the public-at-large but presented the viewer with a glimpse of the homosexual that showed us that at the end of the day they really aren't much different than we are.

One of the main reasons I really love this film is that it's so honest, acerbically funny, intense, and realistic in its depiction of gay men and their approach to each other and to life.  It shows the pain that ALL couples and lovers go through, regardless of their sexual orientation.  This film shows they're HUMAN, like the rest of us straights, and it makes for a very memorable film.  Too often gay characters in films and TV are way too good to be true.  It's political correctness run amok in many ways, as many writers/filmmakers are afraid (or refuse) to show flawed gay men and lesbians.  We all have flaws and things we don't like about ourselves, and this film shows that so well.  This is not a sitcom version of gays or an indie film version of them.

The film is complex, witty, charming, powerful and brutally honest. Like an onion the more you watch it, the more the layers are revealed.

Friedkin directs his masterpiece with a firm, objective hand never becoming too preachy or self absorbant.

This film can only be compared with other flawless dialogue driven films such as ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf"" or ""Glenngary Glen Ross"".

1193983,5,B000006GST,"Mart Crowley will always be remembered for this gem of a film (based on the stage play) because of its evocative and dead-on treatment of humanity, particularly that of gay men.
The movie, like the stage play, is set in a New York City apartment. Seven gay men (and one gay prostitute) are going to be attending a bithday party hosted by Michael. As the film opens, we are visually introduced to the main characters.  We then see Michael's smart and proper apartment and know that he is preparing for the party.  Michael's weekend boyfriend Donald arrives and they talk about everything from anxiety attacks to financial woes to the effects of alcohol.
Suddenly, everything is turned on its head as Michael gets a very odd and uncharacteristic phone call from his college roommate, Alan.  Alan is in town and wants to meet up with Michael, but Michael isn't sure that Alan should arrive in the middle of a birthday party for gay men.  Alan breaks down and begs to see Michael.  They agree on a quick drink and Michael and Donald explore how they are going to handle a straight man at a gay party.
Thinking the doorbell is Alan, Michael opens it to find that Emory, Hank and Larry have arrived.  He tells them what is going on and then Bernard, another guest, arrives.  Michael demands that everyone play it cool and straight while Alan is there.
As the party gets underway with appetizers and music, Michael gets a phone call from Alan expressing regrets about his breakdown and suggests they get together for lunch the next day.  Michael is relieved and the party starts to flow even better.
Michael, Bernard, Emory, and Larry begin a dance routine they learned on Fire Island and don't hear the doorbell.  When Hank answers the door, it isn't Harold, but Alan, who has dropped by unannounced.  He sees Michael and the other men dancing and there is a grand uncomfortable moment as the party comes to a screeching halt.
Alan and Michael talk and then as Alan gets ready to leave, a fight ensued between Alan and Emory with Emory ending up with a bloody face.
The rest of the movie is a very real, very poignant look at human nature. There is an attempt to expose someone in the closet, a look at fidelity within a gay relationship, the fear of growing old and a wonderfully crafted discussion on the nature of beauty.
Although all of the actors in the film are excellent, Cliff Gorman as the effiminate Emory steals the show.  (Gorman, incidentially, would go on to portray Lenny Bruce in the stage play ""Lenny"" and would receive high acclaim for his work only to be replaced by Dustin Hoffman for the movie version.)
What makes the film work for all mature audiences is that the character portrayals are seemless.  We can all see some of our own faults in at least one of the characters.
The only drawback is that this film is not yet out on DVD, although it should be!
If you get a chance to see this film, do so.  It is a very fine piece of film that deserves all the acclaim it gets.",1086739200,10,2988,4.511111111111111

  That said, this film, which preserves almost the entire text of Mart Crowley's remarkable play, and also preserves for us the magnificent performances of the original New York cast, and is a very funny, very sad, very powerful testament to being members of a partly invisible and wholy destested minority within an indifferent-to-hostile larger society.  The sense of being pariahs is something with which many younger gay and Lesbian people have not been burdened.  But 30-35 years ago, it was practically inescapable.  The play shows many ways in which gays at the time coped;  it also shows how some subconsciously, or ultimately, bought into the straight world's condemnation of their orientation.  It is perhaps the fey self-hatred of some of the main characters which modern, upbeat gays find so distressing. ... This play shows men crushed under this insupportable weight, and if anything, their humor, their resilience, their dogged determination to go on, is heroic.  Michael, post-party, spells it out quite simply: ""If we could only not hate ourselves so much: that's it, you know. If we could only not hate ourselves quite so very much.""  In thirty years we've made very significant progress in that direction:  but this play is a powerful reminder, and testament to, where we were.  And if it shows how far we've come,  it also reminds us of how far we have yet to go.
  Now, please release it on DVD!!!!!!",1067731200,,1426,4.962025316455696
1193987,5,B000006GST,"As an aside... Mart Crowley's sequel to ""The Boys in the Band"" entitled ""The Men from the Boys"" opened a few months ago in San Francisco and was extended a a couple of times. It is set in Michael's apartment once again and Harold again arives halfway through. This time however, they are coming together after the funeral of Larry, who has died from Cancer. In addition, there are three young men as well. The only original ""boys"" missing are Alan and Cowboy.  Michael, Harold, Donald, Emory, Hank and Bernard all appear and there's even a ""from the grave"" appearance by Larry. From what I understand it is a study in how the different generations of gay men relate to each other. Sadly, Michael is still not a happy camper but the script, once tightened up a bit, will make a worthy sequel once it likely hits the NYC off-broadway scene and perhaps even into a movie sequel.
Also, Cliff Gorman died on Sept. 5th of 2002 from Leukemia leaving only 3 ""Boys"" left... Hank (Laurence Luckinbill), Alan (Peter White) and Bernard (Reuben Greene). All the boys except Emory died from AIDS.
I sincerely hope that if the sequel does make it to film that Mart Crowley would use the three remainging original ""Boys"" actors in the film. I've met Laurence Luckinbill and briefly discussed the work with him and he is rightly very proud of it. I'm sure he would jump at the chance to reprise his role. Using these three actors would lend the sequel a profound connection to the original...
I mean, who could play Hank, Alan & Bernard.... better than... well ""Hank, Larry & Bernard?""
Also, do pick up a copy of ""3 Plays by Mart Crowley""... the two additional plays deal with Michael pre and post ""Boys"" (though the pre ""Boys"" story doesn't have his as Michael, the forward reveals that this play was vey much about the young Michael)... the post ""Boys"" play will feel VERY timely in light of current events!
I hope we will see a release of ""The Boys in the Band"" on DVD with deleted scenes and other bonus features. I know that there was a deleted scene between Larry and Hank after their turns at the ""telephone game"" as well as obviously cut scenes between Michael and Donald when Michael is wrapping Harold's gift.
I find the original film had some eerie foreshadowing of AIDS in that Michael is tying a red ribbon to Harold's gift and in the beginning Donald tells Michael that his doctor just cancelled because he has a ""virus or something""... coincidental to be sure... but still...
Anyway, I am glad that ""The Boys in the Band"" finally has a sequel and that this work has finally earned the respect it so well deserves after decades in politically-incorrect limbo.

Contains brief male nudity.
  The Boys In The Band (1970) is one of my favorite movies I can watch again and again.  It still sends a message and holds up well even in this decade.  Every actor in the cast is perfect for the character they play. Memorable performances. All of the actors in this film also appeared in the prior off-Broadway production.
  This film may have been the first major film to portray homosexuality in a mature and tasteful way and still is the best film above all.
  This is not a disgusting film.  It is honest and dramatic.
  I have seen this film several times through different ages and chapters of my life.  I get more out of it each time.
  Sadly, most of the cast is no longer with us.
 Robert La Tourneaux passed away June 3, 1986. AIDS. Age: 41. Cliff Gorman and his wife took care of him towards the end.
 Leonard Frey passed away August 24, 1988. AIDS. Age: 49.
 Fredrick Combs passed way September 19, 1992. AIDS. Age: 56 and just 8 days later Keith Prentice passed away September 27, 1992. Cancer and AIDS-related complications.
 Kenneth Nelson passed away October 7, 1993. AIDS-related illness.
 Cliff Gorman passed away September 5, 2002. Leukemia.
  Laurence Luckinbill, Reuben Greene, Peter White and Maud Adams are still with us, as well as, playwriter and screenwriter Mart Crowley and Director William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist).

  All men should see this film.

  The DVD version offers a beautiful, fresh print of the movie in brilliant colors. Much more superior than any horrible VHS print or broadcast television print.
  Any broadcast television version you may have seen has only shown it in its edited-down version.

  This DVD version,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boys-in-the-Band/dp/B001CQONPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boys in the Band</a>, includes the shocking language of 1970, but now all too commonly used even in the 2010's.
  The DVD also includes in Special Features. Interviews with Mart Crowley, William Friedkin, Laurence Luckinbill and Peter White.

  There is no other mainstream film about male-friendship/relationship so deep and well-written. You will laugh and enjoy and may even shed a tear.
  They can never make a film like this again with an excellent ensemble cast.

1193989,1,B000006GST,"I was appalled when this soap opera made it to the Broadway stage and even more appalled when it was immortalized on film -- it has every tired cliche in the book and then some about the poor, unhappy, closeted gayboy and his equally vacuous friends. Its claustrophobic milieu is the Upper East Side of Manhattan and its denizens, who summer on Fire Island -- a small enclave of a gay ghetto.  These characters have nothing to do with anyone I've ever cared to know -- they are shallow, superficial and boring.  The only two interesting characters in it are the bitchy, self-loathing pock-marked queen and the hustler -- who is as dumb as a box of rocks but drop-dead gorgeous (played by the late Robert LeTourneaux who made a career out of the role). The picture it paints of gay life is depressing and dreary; if all gay people were like this, they should commit suicide. They'd be happier.  While this play and film were highly praised and accepted at the time, the dark and brooding ""Cruising"" was denegrated and rejected by the queens who loved this one. ""Cruising"" was equally insular in its depiction of a small sub-culture of the gay scene; but one that the mainstream gay man did not want to acknowledge. For a historical glimpse of ""what it was like then,"" get them both and compare. But don't take this one seriously.

1193993,5,B000006GST,"When I was seventeen years old I was cast in this play without even knowing what the premise was.  I read for the part of ""Cowboy"" and had no idea what the part was, or what the show was about (I simply wanted another role in another play).  Boy, did I get an education!!!
This film is essentially the stage play on film.  Friedkin (who is either horrible or great) directs this by letting the material guide him rather than the other way around.  The result is a brilliant film that is the sum total of its parts and not bits of material scattered across the screen.
Following a rather familiar format (comedy for the first act, and tragedy for the second) this play/film engages us with its very real (some say dated - although I'm not too sure) characters and lets us get to know them intimately.  The second half digs a bit deeper - in fact, it digs down to the heart of the matter and shatters the facade that has been laid before us:  Gay doesn't mean happy anymore!
Frankly, I think this film shows us that gay men are people who are just as feeling as anyone else, no more, no less.  Is that dated?  I don't think so.  Just because gay rights have moved forward, they haven't iradicated the pain or suffering of growing up gay in a heterosexual world.  Strip this film down to the bones, and that is what it is all about.

We still are trying to figure out how to forge a community, deal with racism, negotiate a primary relationship, support our friends, recognize problems with drugs and alcohol, come out of the closet in the first place (!!), etc.  And just for sheer volume of laughs, this movie is hard to beat.  I first saw it about ten years ago, shortly after I started college, and the exchange before Alan arrives, when everyone is trying to butch it up (""You think the Yankees will win the pennant this year?""), cracked me up then and still does.

1193998,5,B000006GST,"Mart Crowley's 'The Boys in the Band' is a minor masterpiece of American cinema that was also instrumental in thrusting gay life and issues into the American mainstream.
Based upon the 1968 Off-Broadway play, this 1970 film adaption by William Friedkin retains all of the stage cast and most of the dialogue. The story is simple enough, Michael Connelly is throwing a party for his friend Harold when an old college roommate, who is presumably straight, arrives and throws the party into turmoil. Michael, who clearly has had a drinking problem, hits the bottle again as a result of the conflict. Kenneth Nelson gives a brilliant performance as Michael who is quickly unravelling with every drink and who begins to tear down his friends one by one. The party climaxes in a 'truth' game which proves oddly cathartic to everyone but Michael.
Many issues have arisen over the years with 'The Boys in the Band'. Were these men mostly stereotypes? Is this work still relevant to gay life? What does it say about where we are in light of where we've been?
Your answers to these questions may well depend on your age. For myself, when first viewing this as a 22 year old in 1987, I found it amusing but ultimately sad and upsetting. A dozen years later of being out in gay life, I have come to learn how masterful this work is and that while times have changed in many ways for the better, many of the issues that the 'boys' were dealing with back then are still being dealt with today. Issues of religious and societal intolerance and the attempt to forge a positive gay identity in an often hostile world are still very much with us today.
I believe the reason 'The Boys in the Band' is so humorous is that the camp humor of that time was largely a coping mechanism of sorts. This is black humor at its best, showing us the brutal honesty of a situation while exposing the many absurdities in it at the same time.
 In the end Michael states 'I don't understand any of it, I never did.'... food for thought...
 Also: Pick up a copy of '3 Plays by Mart Crowley'. The story of Michael Connelly pre and post ""Boys in the Band"" is powerfully explored in these two additional plays. (Read the forward 1st!)",945734400,122,2195,4.526448362720403
