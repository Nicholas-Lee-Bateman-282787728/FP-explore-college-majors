6073032,4,B00GDEZPGG,"Like every fan of Jude Law, I've always wanted his best and found him engaging but unlike every Jude Law fan, I was very disappointed in him because of the roles he does. He always seems to come all the way to meet my expectation but never quite musters enough killer instinct. I liked him in Gattaca, Side Effects, Road To perdition, Alfie (he was ok) but I have never seen him truly be free.

Dom Hemginway is where Jude Law truly outshines as the protagonist. From the very first scene you are taken aback and a bit out of words. There are many amazing scenes in the film where he truly outshines. He plays an alpha male. A man has just come out of jail after spending 12 years in prison. He doesn't know it's not good to smoke in bars no more, he doesn't know there are now electronic safes, all he knows is he needs his money to avenge his loss of time and life, it is very OVER THE TOP but it makes sense because JUDE LAW somehow (dont ask me how) pulls off the role with aplomb and glory.

This is one of his best films, I'm truly proud of him. Its like this,

Ben Kingsley had SEXY BEAST
Joseph Gorden Levitt had HESHER
Now Jude Law has Dom Hemingway and it was really needed.

I strongly urge you to watch this film for Jude Law's performance alone. He is in every scene of the film. The film has various chapters, the music is pumping, the end is laconic, the story is not the best ever written but hey mate, you will not give a flying saucer on that accord. Leave your phone aside and let DOM HEMINGWAY do it's thing. Very very good film.",1402099200,5,1549,4.153333333333333
6073033,4,B00GDEZPGG,"Some directors like to test the endurance of their audiences, and Richard Shepard, writer-director of ""Dom Hemingway,"" is one of them. The very first scene shows the title character (Jude Law) naked in prison, shouting a long, profane and boastful tribute to his favorite anatomical feature. Long and profane monologues, we soon discover, are typical of Dom Hemingway, who has all the macho bravado of his author namesake if not that author's laconic style.

Dom has spent 12 years in prison for safecracking; he would have gotten out sooner, but he refused to squeal on his boss, the mysterious and sinister Ivan Fontaine (Demian Bichir), in expectation of a big payday when he gets out. The movie is the story of what happens to Dom when he's finally sprung. There are many twists and turns he doesn't quite anticipate, though nearly all of them are caused by his notable lack of impulse control. Besides Fontaine, the characters involved include Dickie Black (Richard E. Grant), Dom's dapper best friend; Paolina (Madalina Ghenea), Fontaine's gorgeous but mercenary mistress; Evelyn (Emilia Clarke), Dom's grown daughter, who wants nothing to do with him; and Lester (Jumayn Hunter), a gangster who has never forgiven Dom for killing his cat.

In the end, ""Dom Hemingway"" is a lightweight film. But it's a wild and usually exhilarating ride, thanks to Law's go-for-broke performance and the scintillating scatological dialogue Shepard writes for him. The supporting cast is fine, but this is Law's show all the way, and it is a compliment to say he makes a spectacle of himself.",1400112000,9,1581,5.053639846743295
6073034,4,B00GDEZPGG,"""Dom Hemingway"" (2013 release from the UK; 94 min.) brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, Dom is told that he is being released after a 12 year jail stint. Fresh out of jail, Dom and his best mate celebrate his release with a 3 day booze, sex and drug-filled outing, after which they go to France to visit Mr. Fontaine, who is holding the money that is owed to Dom for keeping his silence 12 years ago. In a parallel story, Dom eventually meets his now-grown daughter, who has become a young mother while Dom was in jail. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is all about Jude Law. In the trailer, the headliner comment was ""Jude Law like you've never seen him before"", and that is only the half of it. He is clearly enjoying himself in this outlandish role, Check out for example his startling monologue in jail that opens the movie. It helps that the script (from writer-director Richard Shepard) feeds him lots of quick lines that keep things loose. At some point Dom introduces himself to the young son of his estranged daughter: ""I'm Dom. Dom is English for unlucky son of a b**ch"", ha! Second, if it wasn't clear by now, the movie features plenty of swearing and crass expressions, as well as nudity, so if these things are offensive to you, stay away. Third, there is an interesting soundtrack that, besides the score from Rolke Kent, features plenty of great British bands like the Alarm, the Godfathers, Motorhead, Big Country and others.

I had seen the trailer for this, and couldn't wait to see the movie. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw it at turned out to be a quasi-private screening, as there was literally only 1 other person in the theater besides myself. That is not a good sign for the commercial viability of this movie in theaters. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a crime comedy-drama with a stellar performance of Jude Law and don't mind the swearing and nudity, ""Dom Hemingway"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theaters or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1398556800,17,2197,4.587786259541985
6073035,4,B00GDEZPGG,"In (and as) Dom Hemingway, Jude Law emancipates himself from his status as a beautiful leading man and delivers one of his finest performances to date.  He is heavier and unshaven.  He has a gold tooth.  And he is profane and violent:  the film opens with the character, a London thief nearing the end of his decade-plus period of incarceration, delivering an ecstatic soliloquy in ode to his, shall we say, manhood.  The enthusiastic quality of Law's performance, the sense he is eager to dive into this colorful rogue and explore each compartment and touch each sharp edge, both buoys and, in a way, betrays Dom Hemingway as a film.  It is a towering piece of acting.  Whether he is raging, seducing, stealing, or otherwise causing trouble, it is a delight to see Law move as the character and an even grander delight to hear him rip through the dialogue, laced as it is with obscenities and left-field cultural references, with ferocious machine-gun speed.  As Hemingway's closest (perhaps only) friend and previous partner-in-crime, Richard E. Grant, a cult icon of British comic cinema due to Withnail and I, is also very strong, embracing the role of the dry and wry straight man with poise and wit.

Which leaves us with the film in which Law and Grant find themselves.  It is fine, solid even, and has a confident visual style defined by bright colors tempered by urban grit, yet it is also plagued by a modest, unspectacular air.  Tonal transitions, including a third-act emphasis on Hemingway's sentimental bid to win over his estranged daughter, are mechanical rather than graceful.  Its vision of an old-school gangster caught in a shifting and volatile landscape is never as persuasive as, say, The Long Good Friday, nor is the entire enterprise anywhere near as high-impact and well-woven as, say, Snatch.  In the end, we are left with a second-tier crime romp with a first-tier, downright majestic performance.  On a personal level, the vast pleasure I derived from Law's achievement largely compensates for the shortcomings of the film to which he has bequeathed the performance, though others' mileage will no doubt vary in this regard.",1397433600,12,2153,4.944444444444445
6073036,2,B00GDEZPGG,"Meet Dom Hemingway he is a safe cracker who had done twelve years jail time and covered up for Europe's Mr Big - Mr Fontaine who is a Russian gangster with a penchant for killing things - especially people. Dom gets out and the first thing he does is seek retribution on the man who took care of his family while he was doing time. Then he goes on a three day bender before heading off to France to pick up his dues.

He is accompanied by Dickie Black - played with effortless charm by Richard E. Grant. Dom seems to have a liking for alcohol, drugs, sex and swearing which he enjoys doing to excess. He also seems to have a knack for rubbing people up the wrong way. Things were never going to run smooth and what ensues is the highs and lows of his quest to get back his life and make up for the lost twelve years.

This is essentially a one man performance from Jude Law as the man in the title. It lies somewhere between a gangster flick, social commentary (albeit it very lop sided) and dark humour. There are some brilliantly funny lines and Richard E. Grant gets to do time perfect delivery on more than one occasion. But for the high points there are many short comings, such as people behaving in a way that you would find hard to believe except outside of the medium of farce. The seemingly constant `potty mouth' and grand standing does start to wear a bit thin at times too and the fact that I found it incredibly difficult to like Mr Hemingway and please don't get me wrong I adore earthy expletives often wondering why our best are still over a thousand years old - surely time for some new ones? But if you can't like the main man then you are never going to really care too much what happens to him.

Director and writer Richard Shepard knew what he wanted and it is fair to say that Jude Law does deliver in spades, but at the end of the day I felt the overall film left me a bit unbothered. There is still a lot to merit attention here especially the two leads and if you are a fan of either man then you will not be disappointed by this film but as an ensemble piece it did, for me, fall slightly short.",1396396800,5,2122,4.170731707317073

It was a must have immediately, especially since I've never seen Jude Law do that kind of role. It's an in-your-face raunchy vulgar comedy. I prefer it in blu-ray with 7.1 surround sound since everyone's accent is a little on the heavy side.

6073059,3,B00GDEZPGG,"If Guy Ritchie had directed Sexy Beast, Dom Hemingway would have been the result. Law is a force of nature here, and the reason to watch, but he's really just doing an extended imitation of Ben Kingsley's ultra-cockney psycho gangster. I half-expected him at some point to go, ""No. No no no no no no no."" He almost does. Kingsley made it both funnier and scarier, but Law gives it a full-throttle go that you gotta admire. Otherwise the movie never really quite gels or finds its footing. There's a tremendous amount of spittle-flying shouting, and a few lines of dialogue that are funny in their Tarantino-esque over-the-top eloquence. Then there are the quieter, ""tender"" moments. And various other bits and pieces that never quite seem to add up to a full story. Besides Law, even though there are a couple top-flight actors here, they don't seem comfortable in their characters. It's not bad, but it's kind of exhausting and frustrating, cuz you feel it could have been a lot better.",1440028800,,987,4.777777777777778

6073065,5,B00GDEZPGG,"I could not believe my eyes when I saw the original rating for this film on Amazon.  I give Dom Hemingway (2013) a flying 5 stars...hands down my second favorite British film from 2013, after Filth starting James McAvoy.  Speaking of which, the two films have identical pulp-like atmosphere with strong central characters who are not necessarily your typical heroes...as a matter of fact, they are down right unlikable, at least by the common man.  If I was to compare Dom Hemingway to any other films I would say its similar to: Filth (2013), In Bruges (2008), and Bronson (2008).  When watching the film I was at first under the impression that it was directed or at least produced by Guy Ritchie.  But the film was made by the same man who brought us The Matador (2005) and Hyena (2014), Richard Shepard.

Dom Hemingway played by Jude Law (Law is sensational, one of his best performances on screen if not the BEST) is an ex-convict just released from prison after a 12-year stay for a bank robery.  Hemingway (don't confuse it with the famous American iconic novelist) is a well-known safe-cracker in the English underground world.  He is an ill-tempered, cocky, your typecast English hoodlum like criminal who is not afraid to speak his mind and or get into a fight for no apparent reason.  One might say, he is a sort of a provocateur with a strong inner-self-worth. Once out of prison, Hemingway goes after the people who betrayed him and who owe him $$$$ and his loyalty...at first Hemingway seem to act foolishly, like a knucklehead he goes rumbling through the streets and pubs of London and southern France...however, along the line Hemingway does a good dead or two...and he realizes...once again Jude Law's acting and portrayal of fictional character Dom Hemingway is electrifying...it is so good, I am speechless and out of words to describe it...his character is much deeper than the movie shows...as is the moral of the story.

The soundtrack of the film is also worth checking out. The track includes Emilia Clarke, Big Country and Citizen Cope.  The Fisherman's Blues by Emilia Clarke should be the theme song of the film.",1432598400,,2140,4.8038147138964575

I mostly agree with the reviewer who said he expected Guy Ritchie & got Will Ferrell, except that Will Ferrell does manage to be funny which I don't think Jude Law succeeds at at all. There was really no plot to speak of, just a very tired & very old cliche about some stolen money but the whole sequence of events unrolls so choppily & the Dom Hemingway character is so overwrought & unsympathetic, you wind up rooting for the wrong people (or no one - just for the bloody film to end already).

Nothing redeeming in this thing. Saw it all better in Sexy Beast & that was no great shakes either but at least Kingsley can be truly menacing, not just pathetic like an overweight Jude Law.",1422403200,,823,4.4144736842105265

6073090,4,B00GDEZPGG,"The opening shot in the film pretty much sets the stage for the title character.  We see Dom (Jude Law) bare-chested extolling the virtue of his sexual member.  We soon understand that he is in prison and...uh...not alone.  After the credits role, Dom is freed from what has been 12 years in the slammer.  A career criminal and prolific safe cracker, he's managed to keep his mouth shut as to higher ups in the chain of command.

Dom's best friend Dickie (Richard E. Grant) tells him that crime boss, Mr. Fontaine (Damian Bichir), is going to be especially appreciative beginning with a 3-day adventure with hookers, booze and cocaine.  Once that is over, Dom and Dickie head for Fontaine's island resort in St. Tropez.  Dom is still very hung-over and almost ruins his welcome by chastising Fontaine and those like him.  Worse, he begins to flirt with Fontaine's girlfriend, Paolina (stunningly beautiful-can't-take-my-eyes-off-her, Madalina Diana Ghenea).

After a night of reflection, Dom realizes the error of his ways and apologizes to Fontaine.  After all is forgiven they all get drunk/stoned with some extra ladies brought in for the occasion and go for a car ride in Fontaine's Bentley convertible.  In a terrifically imaginative car crash I'll always remember, Paolina manages to skedaddle back to the mansion and takes off with Dom's financial reward, given to him earlier by Fontaine.

Once back in England, writer/director Richard Shepard's film takes a couple left turns.  While locked up in prison, Dom's wife died leaving his young daughter, now a twenty-something singer, Evelyn (Emilia Clarke) on her own.  She's written off her dad, but of course, he now wants to make amends.  She has a child of her own of about 6, but that story doesn't really go anywhere, except perhaps bodes well for the future.

Another turn involves an old criminal acquaintance he runs into while jogging in the park.  They don't like each other but Dom needs a job.  Lestor (Jumayn Hunter) says if Dom can open his new safe in 10 minutes or less, he'll give him a job.  If not, Dom will lose that below-the-belt appendage he's so proud of.  This is all just a set up to see Dom, indeed Law, break out a sledgehammer in another unforgettable scene.

Dom Hemingway is one of the profane characters you can't help but like...at least from a distance.  Law is at his best and is the reason you'll want to see the film.

The Blu ray treatment of the film is first rate.  It comes in 1080p video resolution and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The film is colorful with an emphasis on reddish tones, seemingly popping up with regularity.  The detail is excellent as are skin-tones and the overall color scheme.  St. Tropez offers an excellent opportunity for some beautiful outdoor shots, but interiors are first rate as well.  Several language options are available, most in DTS 5.1 but English speaking audiences will want to opt for the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 version.  It is excellent.  Urban shots present opportunities for the surrounds to shine.  Ambient sounds are plentiful and well handled.  Dom has a very heavily accented English, but the dialog is clear and well done.  Subtitles for this track are available in most major languages (17 by my count).  Extras include 4 short featurettes, and a ping pong loop featuring 30 minutes of a topless actress hitting a ping pong ball back and forth to herself on the other side of the table.  This is actually in the movie!  There is a commentary track by Shepard, a trailer and some stills.",1416268800,,3532,4.808970099667774
6073091,5,B00GDEZPGG,"Safecracker Dom Hemingway (Jude Law) leaves the stir after a twelve year stretch for keeping his mouth shut.  He's pale, paunchy, puffy, and looking for payback.  All spit and vitriol Hemingway wants compensation for his lost time in the form of quid, lots of it, in his pocket.  Taking no prisoners Hemingway smokes, drinks, and fornicates like it's his last chance to indulge his vices.  Some fault the film for being over-the-top and in lesser hands that may be the case.  Law, however, is a very intuitive actor which doesn't mean he's not willing to take chances.  Seemingly infused with testosterone he instinctively knows how far to go and still engender sympathy from his audience.  Law's hysterical opening monologue about his privates is worth the price of admission alone.  One of the best performances and films of the year.  Fox seems to have adopted a policy of releasing niche films like this one on Blu-ray only.  I happened to come across a used DVD rental copy of this film.

Jude Law is Amazing, best  actor ever. His depiction of the character is a master piece. The plot is original.
Those people who wrote the bad review, probably, are fans of those  cheap romantic movies ,like The lucky one, by the overrated Mr. Spark",1414454400,,340,4.827586206896552
6073097,3,B00GDEZPGG,"Giving this movie Three Stars is actually doing it an injustice.  It hardly merits a solid Two.  However, Jude Law's portrayal of the title character, Dom F**king Hemingway, earned the movie a star unto itself.

I guess the best thing I can say about this movie is that we watched it on a Sunday morning and weren't really bothered about what we were watching.  Had this been the evening entertainment, I highly doubt we would have lasted through the whole film.

Jude Law was pretty dang good as Dom.  I'll give him that.  His character was believable.  What wasn't would have been Mr. Fontaine.  Mexico City born Damian Bichir (Marco from The Bridge) plays an Italian mobster? who owes Dom a lot of money for keeping his mouth shut during 12 years of prison.  During that time Dom doesn't get to see his daughter grow up, his wife divorces him and remarries then dies.  Dom feels he's owed big time.

Richard E. Grant (Michael Heseltine in Iron Lady) plays Dickie Black, Dom's best friend.  Together the two go off to Mr. Fontaine's villa to collect his due.  Things go awry and Fontaine's gold digging girlfriend takes off with Dom money after a wreck which kills Fontaine.

The ending of the story was so harsh and abrupt I was left asking myself why I had even watched the movie and who could have possibly told me it was worth watching in the first place.",1414281600,,1361,4.54320987654321

He does a great job in bringing the character to bigger than life size, which is good in a way, but so well that my wife had to get up and leave several times because of how crude the story was at times. There are some redeeming moments when almost forget how the main character is so obnoxious, but that fact always comes back like a bad relative that just won't stay away.",1413417600,,474,4.053191489361702
6073104,2,B00GDEZPGG,"Jude Law is one of those actors who continue to surprise me.  Hes one of the few actors who I feel is just as adept in comedy as he is in drama, an actor who drips charisma and sex appeal and yet has no problems playing it all down, repulsing an audience or engaging us for our sympathies and not our lusting.  He is a complete package, and his filmography and list of diverse performances speaks for itself.

Jerome Morrow, Dickie Greenleaf, Gigolo Joe, Inman, Brad Stand, John Watson, Alan Krumwiede, Kareninthe list goes on and on.

With the opening monologue to Dom Hemingway, it became apparent that this was going to be yet another one of those characters that would forever be associated with Law, and a character that would further prove his never ending bounty of talent.  Yes, Dom is unlike anything that Law has done before.  There are no similarities to previous performances, for Dom is a complete originality.  Sadly, the film cant live up to the passion and bravado that Law brings to every minute of screen time.

Dom Hemingway is an interesting film.  I don't mean that the film itself is interesting, because sadly it really isnt, but what I mean is that its an interesting case.  Here is a film that really has nothing going for it outside of a very strong performance that anchors it in a way that makes it feel almost better than it is.  The story is kind of thrown away, the background details feel irrelevant and the ending feels awfully tacked on, but Law is so outrageously controlled that he almost makes it all work.  It reminds me of another film that lived and died on the lead performance, and nothing else, Filth, and like that particular film, the leads are rather repulsive human beings with a breaking point.

Here we have Dom, a safecracker who spent 12 years in prison after taking the wrap for a former partner, Mr. Fontaine.  Upon release, Dom has one (well, two) things on his mind; money and revenge.  First, take revenge out on the man who married his ex-wife while he was in the pen.  Second, get your money from said former business partner.  The first part was easy, the second maybe not so much.  After a crazy night of drugs, booze and women, Dom finds himself without his money, and pretty sore about it.  Its worse than all that though, for he also has an estranged daughter, son-in-law and grandson who want nothing to do with him, and for some reason he has the desire to patch things up and make a go of a better life.

All in all, this is just not fully developed.  There are a lot of ideas flowing here, but they feel ill connected.  While the clear influence of the gangster flicks made famous by Guy Ritchie is here, the execution falls seriously short.  The comedic scenes are hit and miss, and many times too over the top and underwhelming to make much of an impact, and despite Laws dedicated line readings, he cant save a film that ultimately feels lazy and uninterested in being as good as it could have been.

It all just feels somewhat pointless, and at the end of the day I forgot why I was supposed to pay attention.

That said, I think I have a splinter, in me is one of my favorite lines in any film Ive seen this year, so theres that!",1413158400,,3201,4.440068493150685

There are two great qualities here that distinguish this film from other British mafiosi ones (some of which are top notch too).

First, spot the many brilliant lines verging on the memorable, poetic, philosophical, and just insanely daft. Dom's rancid homage to his member, which starts things off and may not be everyone's cup of tea, together with the twisted speech he delivers prior to the crash (with all its brilliant visuals) are filled with golden nuggets while interspersed with hilarious vulgarity and terrific over-acting. Further, listen for much quality writing in the monologues. If all you're expecting is one thrill after another at freakish pace, then you'll miss many of the movie's charms and virtues. This is a cut above many other such genre flicks.

Second, Law puts on a gloriously filthy and unabashed performance. Although I was never a fan to begin with, he won me over. The mix of abandon, bravado, jelly sentimentalism, and highly credible acting when the script brought in moments dangerously close to cliche, all show his stature and versatility in a setting that is not considered to be his element. He met the challenge and overcame heroically. Kudos to Law for handling such dramatic and extreme changes in his persona with confidence, aplomb, and profound gusto. I ended up cheering for Dom Hemingway.

Some reviewers have asked what the point was given the mafiosi character, who is often played one-dimensionally and inarticulately. Ask yourself what the point is of having such a raving macho beginning to be later contrasted with the character's emotional opening, while never losing sight of the thug's humanity and sheer absurdity of his actions. This is a film about character development and, while filled with great action sequences, manages to reveal the complex, puerile, and utterly disarming nature of this thug, without romanticizing or losing its high-flown sense of humor.

If there are any snags, I saw two. The ending comes too quickly (that's a compliment, really) and seems inconsequential, and Richard E. Grant has little room to rise and fill in more as a supporting actor. (In fact, despite a great start to his career, his post ""Withnail"" work has seldom risen beyond the perfunctory.)

All in all, a great production that cleverly, insightfully, and comically deconstructs the London macho mafioso while delivering over an hour of tickling entertainment and developing an interesting concept without ever succumbing to hack acting or filler script and dialogue.

6073182,3,B00GDEZPGG,"DOM HEMINGWAY is a perfectly genial and entertaining film at first, with Jude Law clearly relishing the opportunity to play a no-holds-barred bad guy, but it becomes much less so as it progresses.

 The basic plot is that Dom Hemingway (Jude Law) is an ace safecracker who does a 12-year stint in jail for keeping his mouth shut. Upon his release, he sets out to make up for lost time and collect the money that is owed him. Also, in an attempt to make his character more palatable to the audience, there is a subplot about him trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter. The first part of that is a great premise, and one that the movie would have been better to stick with. The second part is filler, to be honest, and the filmmakers lose points for not making a sincere effort at giving Jude Law a believable character arc that would work for the character, as well as be cathartic for the audience.

 Obviously, Jude Law takes center stage here, and he gives a bravura performance as an abrasive, headstrong gangster that seems to have the worst luck in the world, proving the saying that nice guys finish last. Except that he's really not that nice of a guy, code of ethics or not. The first half of the film is rather easy to get through because of the antics, partying, drug-taking and carousing that one usually sees in these type of films. And to its credit, this film does it well and with some style. The problem is that it never really finds its footing after that. Dom just staggers on from misfortune to misfortune, only to get out by the skin of his teeth. He makes no concerted effort to develop as a person, which didn't necessarily have to happen, but then the film should have taken a different direction and not tried to make him appear likable in the first place. I'm also a little miffed because of the misleading trailer, which seemed to indicate there would be more family drama. That would have worked, but again the filmmakers dropped the ball there (or more specifically, writer-director Richard Shepard).

 On the plus side, in addition to Jude Law, Richard E. Grant gives a fine performance as Dickie, Dom's friend and counterpoint to his occasional insanity. To their credit, they have great chemistry and play really well off of each other. Demian Bichir also has a small role as Mr. Fontaine, a crime boss who Dom visits to collect the share he's been waiting for. Other positives include a nice episodic structure built around lines of dialogue in the film. The film is also very well-shot, with some nice on-location shooting in the UK and France.

 Overall, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with this film. I thought I was getting one thing, but I got another. Jude Law gives one of his best (and loudest) performances, but his character is a bit too grating at times and the story he is saddled with never really goes to any interesting or unique places. If Cockney crime films are your cup of tea or you're a Jude Law fan, then by all means give this a watch. For everyone else, I'd say skip it.",1406592000,,3041,4.516363636363637

I love the guy from Withnail & I and Jude Law is a great actor that really doesn't get enough roles anymore.

6073226,3,B00GDEZPGG,"Dom Hemingway is a karmic tale about a violent-tempered, loud mouth egomaniac who is puzzled by the fact that he has terrible luck. After being released from prison, he simultaneously goes about cramming 12 years of lost debauchery into a very short time span and reconnecting with his estranged daughter and her new family. Dom is a man who knows the right thing to do, but because of his own pride and selfish ways, his nasty fate is doomed to repeat itself. The premise and ideas behind the film are surprisingly literary, in many ways mirroring the rise and fall of little Alex in A Clockwork Orange, yet writer/director Richard Shepard struggles to adapt Dom Hemingway into the astute drama it could have been. The scene's of Dom's comeuppance are choppy and poorly paced, acting more as clunky vignettes than regular scenes. The relationship between him and his daughter is nothing that will pull at the heart strings, mainly due to the fact that the film sheds very little light on their relationship to begin with. There is something about the pacing and the storytelling that makes Dom Hemingway seem more suitable as a novel than a film. As a novel, it could have taken more time to get to the conclusion and its abrupt story changes would be far more welcome. But as a film, it's at least capably directed and thrives off the animal energy of Jude Law. Law and his commitment to such an abrasive and unlikable character is clearly Dom Hemingway's strongest aspect. It may not reach its potential, and the story loses its grip when the poorly-introduced Lestor hits the scene, but it's worth watching for Jude Law's performance and some decent ideas about karma and fate.",1402358400,,1681,4.760273972602739
