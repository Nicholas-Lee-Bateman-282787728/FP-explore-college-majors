7810653,4,6301062868,"Brian Ratty has broken this video down into short segments of easily understood concepts. From how to load a camera, qualities of light and types of film to sports, portraiture, nature and travel photography. Good  segments on composition also. I recommend this tape as a teaching aid for  photography programs and a good resource for the serious amatueur who wants  to reinforce basic concepts.",927763200,,395,5.140625
