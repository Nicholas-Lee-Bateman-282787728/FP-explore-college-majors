5057562,1,B0076L0RW2,This video left me completely unsatisfied. Most of the poses no one can do! And I have been doing yoga for years. You literally stand there waiting for the next pose. Plus the flow and pace of the video is boring.,1372809600,,213,4.219512195121951
5057563,5,B0076L0RW2,"Got to say, tried this DVD from a friend who loves it...and I do too now!  Not a huge yoga fan but this DVD kicked me into gear.  Definitely doing more yoga now for the stretches and movement over all but only doing more due to this DVD.  I may try some other progressive power yoga dvds when I get bored of this one but for now and my purposes just this one is fine.",1349654400,,367,3.8666666666666667
8510967,2,B0076L0RW2,"About 15 minutes in, I was feeling a little creeped out by the instructor only touching the bodies of the women to ""adjust"" their poses. Then, near the 25 minute point, he put his face VERY close to one of the women and smiled and when she uncomfortably smiled back, he pinched her side tummy ""playfully."" Perhaps I'm just sensitive in the current #MeToo environment, but I'm not comfortable watching any more of this video. #removefromwatchlist",1510012800,,445,4.868421052631579
8510968,3,B0076L0RW2,Good yoga workout; however.. the amount of touching this instructor does to his women models in the video was a bit disturbing to me.  I am a yoga teacher myself and making adjustments is important but this was a bit too much.,1502841600,,226,4.380952380952381
8510969,5,B0076L0RW2,Mark Blanchard is fabulous!  Very challenging workout - but if u keep with it- it's worth it!,1469750400,,93,4.470588235294118
8510970,5,B0076L0RW2,good workout. slow and smooth so you feel the stretches.,1429056000,,56,4.7
8510971,5,B0076L0RW2,I really like the pace of this video. It flows without being too fast really giving you time to experience the poses. Good encouraging words though out with a calming voice,1420243200,,172,4.580645161290323
8510972,5,B0076L0RW2,"Great workout. Interesting, demand some energy and train the whole body. However you don't have to have much experience to do it. Start with what you can do and grow into it. Helps to loose weight. Standing on your head is not for everyone, but other poses are much more easy. I practiced with Rodney Yee DVDs, and this is a step forward for me. Somehow more muscles are involved and more poses shown. I feel more satisfaction.",1405987200,,427,4.487179487179487
8510973,2,B0076L0RW2,I rented this in hopes it would be somewhat dynamic like Jillian Michael's yoga videos.  This video is very slow moving without any warrior poses or anything very difficult at all.  He spends lots of time doing forward bends into plank and into pushups and lots of talk about breathing.  I am having a very hard time finding anything that resembles the yoga classes I have taken and am very disappointed in this rental.  Glad I didn't buy it!,1391040000,2,442,4.556962025316456
8510974,5,B0076L0RW2,"I like this video. Similar to Brian Kest's Power Yoga, this is a good routine(s) if you want to work hard.",1389484800,,106,4.095238095238095
8510975,5,B0076L0RW2,"This is a pretty challenging yoga routine, it runs about an hour and a half. Its worth the money to buy this video.",1374969600,,115,4.043478260869565
8510976,5,B0076L0RW2,I enjoy this video very much. It is easy to follow allong with. The moves are just easy enough for the beginner and challenging enough to keep an intermediate entertained.,1373155200,,171,4.733333333333333
