4274834,5,B00473YVZQ,"Think about your family history and the black sheep and how you would answer for their transgressions. Multiply that difficulty by infinity and you would face what druglord Pablo Escobar's son has had to answer for. Filmmaker Nicolas Entel has distilled and visualized that moral burden to powerful, personal dimension in ""Sins of my Father.""
This absorbing, multidimensional film should be a strong contender for the Audience Award in the World Documentary Competition at Sundance.
For those too young to remember the reign of terror that Escobar and his Medellin drug ring wreaked on Colombia, not to mention the countless whose lives were destroyed by cocaine, this smart and solid film blends history with a deeply moving, ongoing personal story.
It's told through the eyes of Escobar's son, an architect in Buenos Aires who changed his name to Marroquin to escape the dangers and degradations of using his birth name. Marroquin, now middle-aged, is an introspective and highly intelligent man who has struggled to reconcile the different images of his criminal father: He remembers him as a doting dad but is deeply guilt-ridden by the reality that his father was a rampaging, murderous criminal. Escobar was so ruthless and crazed that at one time he held Colombia captive with merciless assassinations of public officials.
Entel has composed a masterwork, blending original news footage, home movies and Marroquin's candid revelations. Most remarkably, we see that while Marroquin realizes he always will live with his father's sins, he reaches out to the men whose own fathers were killed by Escobar. It's one of the film's most poignant moments when Marroquin and the sons of a Colombian presidential candidate whom Escobar had assassinated embrace one another, realizing they all are victims of the malicious drug trade.
Crisply paced and powerful, "" Father"" is a sobering and richly humane document.",1310947200,9,1910,5.245098039215686

4274856,3,B00473YVZQ,"I was hoping there was more information, more about how Juan Pablo Escobar FELT about his father, how his mother felt about his father-----now, and maybe WHY his sister has disappeared completely ?... To believe that Juan and the sons of the 2 other famous fathers share no negative feelings towards each other would be so ABNORMAL-------do you really think we are that ignorant  ?!  Believe me there are feelings but I am happy if the Escobars' have been able to find some sense of peace about the past for we all do deserve that very much!! Also how much money do the Escobars make from the current regime in Colombia from cocaine business ? yeah there has to be something... BTW do you realize how many people die each year in the USA from cocaine ? how many others lives it destroys ?? if you wanna really do something worthwhile why not try to help those people and their families...",1476835200,,888,4.509316770186335
4274857,1,B00473YVZQ,"Di not like the documentary.  Just another political propaganda for PabloEscobar's son in order to court the favor of future important politicians the Galan  and Bonilla  sons in order to have allies when, not if, Escobar's son and family decide to return to Colombia.  Escobar's son wants to legitimize his return to Colombia and perhaps pressure the government to guarantee his safety.  What better way to do it than to ""pretend"" to offer an apology to the fatherless children of Escobar's arch enemies.",1475107200,,505,5.036144578313253

4274869,5,B00473YVZQ,"Fascinating look into Escobar's family and their part in his exploits. Perhaps more fascinating is the way his son, Juan Pablo (Sebastian) viewed his father then and now with no real change. The only change was his view of the victims and his redemption which was amazing to witness. Also his courage to face his father's victims' children and vice versa. My favorite part was an eloquently written letter by Sebastian. Highly recommended if you are old enough to remember this notorious drug kingpin or the new generation who only woke up to this story thanks to Narcos on Netflix ;)",1446940800,2,584,4.792079207920792
