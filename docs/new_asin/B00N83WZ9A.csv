6612738,5,B00N83WZ9A,"In response to the above, I grew up during the era of Ali.  For a man some criticize for shortcomings as a man he has very few when you think of the totality of his life and incredible influence",1413158400,5,194,3.9743589743589745

6612747,5,B00N83WZ9A,"this was the 1st of the many dvd memorabilia's I purchased, and watched since his passing; it was so inspiring a little sad, because he is no longer with us, but i am relieved that he recorded and filmed the memories for his family to share with us....... I am sure God is PLEASED with all of Muhammad Ali's good Deeds while he was here on Earth..... I'm So Proud to be a 60's baby and to have followed his career and life coming up!

6612751,5,B00N83WZ9A,"I saw more historic and archival footage of Muhammad Ali in his prime in this new video documentary than in any other production or source about ""The Greatest"" I've ever viewed, YouTube included.  This 2014 production is perhaps the most insightful account of Ali's personal and professional lives that has ever been compiled; now, the nation having recently just experienced Ali's death, ""I Am Ali"" takes on an added poignancy.  Structuring this video around Ali's family audio recordings was an interesting and effective way of conveying the essential humanity of this man.  The unrehearsed and spontaneous footage and film outtakes from Angelo Dundee's training gym in Miami and Ali's rural training camp in Deer Lake, Pennsylvania, are so interesting, and nearly forgotten so many years later.  Kudos to the producers of ""I Am Ali"" for this skillful compilation of sports coverage, 1960s television interviews from both America and Britain, and private home movies and rarely-seen film footage.  A masterful job that anyone seeking to understand Muhammad Ali should watch, especially now that ""The Greatest"" has gone.",1466294400,,1121,5.346590909090909

6612756,5,B00N83WZ9A,"Excellent movie.  Provides a view of Ali and some of his family, friends, and boxing opponents that I had never seen before.  Provides context and helps to understand why Muhammad Ali was such a great man, and great American, with historical impact on the world and so many people.  I especially liked the interview with George Foreman.  I liked the movie so much I have ordered it on Blu Ray DVD so I can watch it again.  Highly recommended.",1465171200,,442,4.544303797468355

6612763,5,B00N83WZ9A,"I am a little younger and a history buff; I honestly thought I knew everything there was to know about Muhammad Ali, but I was wrong! This moving was insightful and it offered us a glimpse of what Ali the man was like: a sweet, thoughtful, sensitive, loving man who truly loved his family and friends! I was touched by the emotions of his ex wife who after the infidelity she was still able to say Ali was an amazing man, father and human being.  Most films have covered Ali as the boxer , but this movie was about his heart, character and humanity. Honestly, if you think you know Muhammad Ali story think again and buy this film.

6612765,5,B00N83WZ9A,"I feel privalaged to have watched Ali fight in the ring, and in the courts also.

I like the film more than well enough but realize like the word ""Free"" in an advertisement, to this day ""Muhammad Ali"" attracts attention despite the fact it has been over 33 years since his last fight and, thus, I had to see this movie.  The opening few minutes into I AM ALI is all it takes to remind yourself just how larger than life Ali was and still is as the film presents anecdotes about his personal and public lives as told by his brother, friends, boxing opponents, children, and even an ex-wife.",1421452800,,637,4.3

He is a great father and role model for young men on how to treat your young daughters, and how to respect women.  He is the greatest.  If I had one question I was left hanging with was his relationship with King.  I know Mohammad was too smart to get ripped off by King, but I'd like to have been spun up on how they negotiated  contracts, percentages, take-home and if he lost vs win with ko

HE IS THE GREATEST AND I MISS THE DAYS WHATCHING HIM FIGHT, AND WE DIDDNT EVEN HAVE TO PAY EIGHT DOLLARS, THOSE WERE THE DAYS.  \\RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU INTERESTED IN ALI'

6612869,5,B00N83WZ9A,Such an intimate story. It really shows his soft side that is not often thought of when you think of Muhammad Ali the boxer. He has the love of his children which there is no greater legacy. Congratulations Hana!,1413244800,6,212,4.461538461538462

The movie was excellent and not damaged but I felt for sure I was going to have even more major problems. Fortunately the disc was okay but part of the case was in pieces.,1477699200,,338,4.136363636363637

8676509,5,B00N83WZ9A,"I was blessed to get this at Walmart for $5. I remember clearly and vividly when this brother was in his prime back in the 70s when you saw the fight on regular tv (before cable came into existence and took the fights)on ABC Wide World of Sports with Howard Cossell. Shoot, I always felt Ali and Cossell could have been an act by itself, but anyhow, this film speaks on various people's encounters with Ali. (His manager, some of his opponents, fans, kids, wives, etc). It also spoke on his stance to not serve in the Army during the Vietnam War. He did a interesting photo shoot for Esquire in 1968,which was shown here, and I really enjoyed the film. Mike Tyson also spoke in the film and gave Ali his props(Ali did it to him as well). Great film. I was real saddened by Mr Ali's death, so glad to have this film on his life. I remember back in the late 70s when Ali wrote his book ""The Greatest"". I remember going to Midtown Manhattan, and Barnes and Noble had copies of his book on display(the cover was yellow), and I bought a copy. He was a great role model for us back in the 70s. He would kill me with his repartee, but when he got silent, I missed it. He truly lived to his nickname, ""The Louisville Lip.""",1473552000,,1214,4.214592274678112
