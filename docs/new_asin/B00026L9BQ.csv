2064094,5,B00026L9BQ,"This was one of the funniest stand up shows I have seen in a while. He calls out all the ""problem"" stars and has no mercy on them, and again talks about Bush and the war, but by far the funniest part of the show was his outlook on marriage; the truth has never been so funny!",1093478400,4,275,3.8421052631578947
2064095,1,B00026L9BQ,"Sorry guys but I agree with R. Robyn.

 First I don't think ""never Scared"" was funny and it is clearly not as good as ""Bigger & Blacker"" or even ""Bring the Pain"". The thing is when a guy makes a bunch of good things and gets people to love him, some people say that everything he does is just great even if it stinks.

 Second a black guy ranting about blacks is funny (Rock in Bring the Pain"") just like a white guy ranting about whites is (Carlin in ""Ur all diseased"") but any guy ranting about other races the way Rock did is not funny but racist.
No white guy could've had Rock's ""blacks v niggas"" routine otherwise he would have been a (...) racist to all of you, think about it!",1093392000,9,684,4.120300751879699
2064096,1,B00026L9BQ,"'Bigger And Blacker' is one of the best comedic routines of our time.  My lady and I were expecting more of the same with 'Never Scared'.  In anticipation, we set aside an evening to watch 'Never Scared' so there would be no interruptions.

We listened intently and watched... and listened... and watched.  Suddenly we realized 'Never Scared' had been on for an hour and much to our dismay, it was not funny.  We were both shy to say it at first because we both enjoyed Chris Rock's other work so much and we could not believe he could not be funny.  We continued to watch and listen anyway.  Unfortunately, it just got worse.

After it was over, we could not believe how horrible it was.  'Never Scared' is such a far cry from 'Bigger And Blacker'.  For instance, ""keeping the daughter off the pole"" is a long drawn out sequence about Chris preventing his new baby daughter from becoming a stripper.  It wasn't at all Chris-Rock-funny, yet he went on for 20 minutes about it.  Also, Chris Rock's focus on a black slave driving a carriage was heavily overplayed.  It was so depressing to watch him drone on about how the slave rode through an intersection of dirt roads without stopping.  It was worse than watching 70's comedian Flip Wilson tell his dragon joke.

I have read the other reviews here.  Folks, the long and redundant ""it's all right, if it's all white"" portion of the show IS NOT FUNNY.  It has nothing to do with race being ok or not ok for Chris Rock to talk about.  IT JUST ISN'T FUNNY.  It is an embarassing rant by someone who can no longer write a joke to save his life.  Watch 'Bigger And Blacker' then watch 'Never Scared' and you will see what I mean.  'Bigger And Blacker' pounds you over the head with content and humor, whereas 'Never Scared' is about as intense as being whipped by a wet linguini noodle.  Didn't anyone notice how quiet the crowd is in 'Never Scared'??

A good example of what is truly racially funny is Dave Chappelle's work.  Truly good rants can be found in the work of Dennis Miller.  In the meantime, we should NOT applaud Chris Rock for his gorked bellowing in 'Never Scared'.",1092787200,21,2127,4.4765625
2064097,4,B00026L9BQ,"I'll admit that there was a (very short) stretch during this show where I felt Chris Rock got a bit carried away with his political and racial beefs. ""It's all right, if it's all white"" is funny once, not five times.  I'm white, I can handle the ugly truth, but shoving it down my throat by using the stage as a soapbox isn't gonna make me laugh.
 If you've seen some of George Carlin's later shows, when he became far too 'preachy' with his political grievances, you know what I mean.
Nevertheless, 90% of this show was Chris Rock at his finest and sharpest, and will have any fan glued, laughing 'til your face hurts.",1090627200,4,619,4.373913043478261
2064098,4,B00026L9BQ,"""Never Scared"" is the latest Chris Rock comedy special from HBO.  I have long considered Rock to be one of the funniest comics in America (in my limited experience) and was expecting great things from ""Never Scared"".  My high expectation from Chris Rock may have led to my slight disappointment.  In a sense, it was classic Chris Rock, but that was also the problem.
Rock's comedy focuses on relationships, politics, government, race relations, and now parenthood (since Rock is now a parent).  There is plenty of material for Chris to draw upon, but the problem I had was just that he wasn't as funny as he has been in the past.  This was a new comedy special, but it felt like the same old material, only not quite as funny.  Don't get me wrong, Chris Rock is still a very funny man, but this performance was not at the level that I have come to expect from Chris Rock.  It was good, but it wasn't as good as he has been and is capabale of.  Rock has good points in his comedy, but this isn't his best work.

2064099,4,B00026L9BQ,"In many ways, this concert is very similar to mid-70's Richard Pryor - outrageous, profane, and side-splitting funny. I never thought I'd say this about Chris Rock. Sure, lots of profanity here...so if this offends you, this is not for you. To the 2-star reviewer who commented this is ""anti-white""...lighten up. I got news for you - it's 2004. Making fun of white people is OK. Especially when you do it well. The humor here is not just racial - it's about men/women relationships, sex, social commentary and politics too. And lots of profanity. But really no different than most live comedians these days.  As a big Richard Pryor fan, and Robin Williams too, this is right up there. From someone who was not a big fan of Chris Rock...until now!",1084665600,7,746,4.694656488549619

He can be loud and screechy and is not for everybody, but he is undeniably a brilliant satirist and comedian.  After seeing this, I wanted to see more of his work and watched ""Bigger and Blacker"".

If you're a fan of Rock then you'll notice how he's matured since his other HBO specials.  Of course there is plenty of the signature 'Rock yell' but he's communicating from the perspective of a (then) married-30ish-father of one- who is ""conservative"" about more things these days.

2064139,5,B00026L9BQ,"NEVER SCARED (2004) is Chris Rock's fourth hilarious, thought-provoking HBO concert performance. Highly recommended for Rock fans and those who can accept racy language in pursuit of a good laugh, NEVER SCARED is more than funny.  It's observational humor at its best, whipped up from a precise recipe of three parts cheek-aching laughs and one part disturbing reality.

Maybe not as great as ""Bring the Pain"" -- which will go down in history as one of the most successful comedy performances ever -- NEVER SCARED (2004) is nonetheless a great DVD that Rock fans will love.

Due to its adult content, obviously this DVD is not appropriate for young children -- and possibly not even your friends/relatives.  But just when you wonder how many times Rock can throw a curse into a sentence, he offers viewers a universally true observation that cuts to the core of the realities of American popular culture and male-female relationships.

I agree with some viewers here who note the concert begins awkwardly.  After viewing it a dozen times, I think Rock looks nervous as he struts onto the stage and immediately notes that the main responsibility of fathers is to keep their daughters off the stripper's pole.  Though the bit has enormous potential, Rock looks too vulnerable to make it work as well as later jokes.

After discussing strippers and his increasingly reluctant love of rap music, Rock begins to look more comfortable and starts to hit his stride when he discusses the antics of Michael Jackson and his eccentric family, troubled R&B singer R. Kelly, magician David Blaine and Kobe Bryant.

But truth be told, almost any good comedian could deliver these celebrity-oriented jokes/observations, but what makes Rock unique is his ability to charm the audience with discussions of serious subjects like American patriotism, abortion, ignorant bipartisan politics and marriage.

In a nutshell this is why I love and admire Chris Rock.  He not only makes you laugh so hard it hurts, but he leaves you with more to think about than any other comedian or social commentator I have ever heard of.

2064140,3,B00026L9BQ,"While Rock is still brilliant and perceptive and always somewhat intriguing to listen to, ""Never Scared"" feels more like a sermon than a stand-up routine. Here, he seems almost bitter, his timing is off and the program loses momentum quite early. His rants about The Jacksons, R.Kelly, who ""real Americans"" are and his thoughts on marriage are the strongest bits, but the remainder of this material is woefully lacking in humor and often gets too repetitive to be enjoyable. He's finally run out of steam.",1153785600,2,505,4.952941176470588
2064141,1,B00026L9BQ,"Chris Rock used to be really funny.  He hit his prime years ago with ""Bring the Pain"" and has slowly gone downhill since then.  His movies are lame (or okay at best as long as he is a bit player) and his standup has never come close to ""Bring the Pain"" type funny.  This standup had a couple of laughs but I didn't really care for the whole Al-Cracker thing at all (and I am not a thin-skinned individual or PC person).  I think he just felt he was getting into ""sell-out"" status with his financial success and wanted to try and ""keep it real"".  Sorry Chris, being offensive just to be offensive is not funny.  And while Richard Pryor may be your idol...you can only dream of being 1/100th as funny as he was.  Pryor said some offensive things but always had a point and was always FUNNY!!  If you really do like Chris Rock though I suggest you check out ""Bring the Pain""...that was actually very funny.

2064142,4,B00026L9BQ,"I used to think Chris Rock was just average and slightly funny. My impression of him has grown considerably and I was very much surprised how insighful and witty he really is. I found his material, though dated, ( O.J. for example ) to be very true and sadly profound. He takes old material and somehow manages to formulate it to make it contemporary and relevant and this is a very difficult and arduous task, especially when most people already heard O.J. jokes before. But that is his brilliance and no other does it quite as well. I honestly think this is one of the most insighful comedic dialogues regarding social contradiction, relationships, wealthyy vs. rich and  politics. I think his strongest material is when he discusses slavery and affirmative action. He ties those two concepts together so well.  His comedic timing is near flawless as well.  Overall this is well worth a viewing.",1140566400,2,897,4.811688311688312

I just don't get the same laugh out loud reactions from his punchlines that I would from a Richard Pryor or an Eddie Murphy or even a Dave Chappelle(not including""For What It's Worth"").But with Chris Rock I find myself nodding and agreeing more then actually laughing most of the time. I would however recommend this to any fan of smart,insightful,irreverent,type of comedy. Then again,""Bring The Pain"" was probably 10 times better then this so i'd probably recommend that instead.",1138233600,,734,4.88
2064144,5,B00026L9BQ,"This definitely a must-have for all fans of comedy. It is sheer brilliance. I loved it immensely. This is definitely the best comedy show ever! That is no exaggeration.

He starts off by talking earnestly about parenthood. Admittedly, this part of the performance is sharp, but not quite razor sharp. It does not set him apart from his nearest rival, Rich Pryor. As he warms up though, talking about strippers and rap music, he goes on a crescendo. The material about how the US government fails to solve any rap murders is a scathing indictment on the government. ""They can find Saddam in a f***ing hole in Iraq, but they can't find the guy who shot Tupac"". Makes you think doesn't it?

Rock blends humour and shocking realism without being pretentious. his humour is effortless and has an unshakeable base in reality. The jokes will have you in seizures of laughter.

He brings a fresh angle to topical issues. His lambastings of Michael Jackson, R Kelly and Kobe Bryant are irreverendly funny.

The Jokes about Iraq are real gutbusters. The material about how the ATM will not talk to you if you have no money is classical. by this time, you will see why Rock is the funniest comedian ever. He wil have put himself ahead of the chasing pack. But wait, you haven't seen the best part yet.

When he talks about relationships, you are guaranteed to fall off your chair with laughter. i have heard hundreds of jokes about marriage and relationships from various acts over the last 40 years, but Rock puts a new spin on it all. It's like a lecture. In fact, it is essential viewing for all those considering a visit to a marriage counsellor. Brilliant.

Chris Rock is really funny in this, and what I like is that he makes so much sense when he's talking about politics, or pretty much anything that affects us in our every day lives. I've read some of the review's that some people wrote, thinking  that some of the things that Chris Rock says about white people seem to be prejudice. I didn't think that at all, and neither did my mom (who's white), and who loved it. I asked her after we watched it, if she was offended by any of the stuff he was saying when he started mentioning race, and she said she wasn't. The way I look at is, Chris Rock is a very intelligent person, who's just speaking the truth about history, and how there still is racism out there. The whole show isn't about race, he talks about other issues too that make all of us think, politics, war, drugs and other things. He's serious when he talks about this stuff, but he also does it in a way that will make you laugh. Overall he's a real funny, smart person. I reccomend watching this, watch it with your friends, or with some people in your family, maybe it will make them think about certain things, and of course also laugh. Some people who've watched this say ""Oh it's not like ""Bigger and Blacker,"" or it's not like ""Bring the pain,"", yah, because it's different. Obvioulsy anytime Chris Rock comes out with a new stand up, it's going to be different from his others. I don't think some people understand that when you get older and you're a comedian, you're not going to keep writing about the same stuff all the time, it's going to be different each time. No matter what, I think his stand ups will always be funny. Also, the people out there who are offended by his race jokes, when he's talking about white people, you guys need to chill out. Do you actually think that he's going to stand up there and put down white people, when he knows that he has fans that are white?  get real. He's just speaking the truth about certain things, maybe the people who don't like what he's saying about how there still is racisim out there, are afraid to hear it. Alot of us have a little bit of prejudice in us, and Chris Rock just tells it like it is. Overall, I really liked this stand up of his, and I recommend wathching it. Two thumbs up!",1123545600,11,2412,4.298901098901099
2064146,4,B00026L9BQ,"Chris Rock seems to be following Pryor's career arc: a dynamic, revelatory first concert follwed by a succession of increasingly weaker and less magical ones.  Don't get me wrong, he's still the best out there, still vital and still an important artist.  It's just that his sets are becoming looser and less focused, robbing his top-flight writing of some of its impact.  For example, the first 30 minutes or so are a bit of a drag as he skewers troubled celebrities who have already had quite enough of it ( Who hasn't made fun of O.J. by now? ).  He also gets caught up in his own words a bit e.g. ""Michael Jackson...Michael Jackson...Michael Jackson!..."" ( alright, I hear ya, now what? ) which eats up time and slows down the flow.  What saves him and this concert are his prickly intelligence and his ferocious indignation at society's constraints, hypocrasies, and double-standards.  When he gets down to his views on politics, race, and relationships, that's when he finally starts to fire on all cylinders and remind us why he's #1.  Toward the end, he starts to remind me of George Carlin's recent work ( ""You Are All Diseased"" for instance, because of his similar angry take on a society gone mad ), which is a good thing since Carlin is still vibrant while sadly, Pryor isn't.  Everything considered, despite the flaws, this is essential viewing and tasty brainfood for the angry philosopher.",1111881600,3,1403,4.768595041322314
2064147,3,B00026L9BQ,"After half a decade, Chris Rock has returned to his audience with more maturity and more things to say about that world. I personally believe his political commentary hits the mark, and he exemplifies the moderate stature in this day and age very well. Aside from this, most of this performance seems a bit more bland, maybe because marraige and wealth have left him little else to say about ""real life."" There are some extremely funny moments peppered throughout, but Never Scared pales in comparison to ""Bigger and Blacker"" by far. The inclusion of extra footage and a classic stand-up from Chris Rock on this DVD will please.",1110585600,,628,4.824074074074074
2064148,4,B00026L9BQ,"Chris Rock has excellent delivery and uses the right compbination of truth, exaggeration, and story-telling to package his humour.

One other person says that Rock focuses on racism and speaks badly of Caucasians while he (the reviewer)as a WHITE person was taught by his white parents to accept everyone.  Very commendabe, but the person misses some things:

Rock tears into the Jacksons, R Kelly and OJ and he pokes fun at black celebrities wasting their money on jewellery and car rims.  So he makes fun of blacks and whites.  And he doesn't attack caucasions as much as he reminds people of how the system has been run for over 300 years.  Is that bad?  No.  Why?  Because there are so many memorials for the Holocaust... even last year I saw various ceremonies.  That took place over a period of about 6 years.  Slavery in America took place for about 300 years.  And the 'in thing' now is for whites to say ""I wasn't there"", ""T didn't to anything blacks"" etc.  The slavery part of America and its impact are being pushed under the carpet.  Even during 'Black History Month' the predominatly white stations educate the country little about what happened.

This ties in with one of Rock's pieces in which he says basically that it has been OK for whites to make 'money from pain'.  In this case the pain was slavery.  'It was bad, but it's all in the past, I didn't have anything to do with it... get over it.'  In this regard Rock is instructive about 'The System.'  I think Rock's material would only upset someone because it makes them uncomfortable... because it is skilfully intertwined with truth.  In fact the best comics use truth in their work.

That reviewer also asked us to name one black comic in the last generation who hasn't used race as a major theme of his comedy.  Ok, here's not one, but two:  Bill Cosby and Will Smith.  Further I have seen white comedians on Black Entertainment Television making race jokes against blacks and seen blacks laughing and laughed myself.  Often jokes are made from stretching and garnishing things, and should be digested in that context.

Rock demonstrates how intelligent he is by actually being wisely educational amidst it all.  In-between-the-lines he tells blacks that if they think they are rich and have reached, that's not quite the case, and that they should not waste money on rims and jewellery and bling because it can all go quickly.  ""Even Rick James was rich.""

And Rock covers many issues.  The War, Parenting, Marriage, Celebrities and more.

I only didn't give this 5 stars because I find Rock curses too much.  But he IS funny and you'll learn some useful things for life.",1109116800,4,2648,4.689130434782609
2064149,3,B00026L9BQ,"He's a funny guy, but like ALL African-American comedy shows, from HBO to the hole-in-the-wall comedy clubs, the loudest laughs come at the expense of Caucasians. It's sad to know in this day and age of terrorism, political uncertainty, and war that Chris Rock can still cash in on racism. This isn't news though is it? Show me a black comedian who doesn't rip on Caucasians, and THAT will be original.

You know while some white people would be offended in an angry way by this, speaking for myself, it hurts my feelings more than anything else. The way I was raised--- to accept everybody for who they are, that racism is bad, equal rights are good and many other values passed to me from my WHITE parents and grandparents. All of that is rendered moot by people like Chris Rock who can't help but generalize, lump us all into evil groups of white-devils looking for the next, best way to keep a brother down--- as if morning, noon, and night this is the ""white man's"" sole pastime and occupation.

With so much going on in the world today that we *should* joke about, here comes Chris Rock to pick at the scabs of history for a cheap laugh, all the while believing that he isn't a bigot. Now, if a white comedian said one sideways thing about blacks, you know what would happen.

So if you're black, and love rubbing the past into the faces of people who weren't there, and if you would rather participate in the creation of more animosity and mistrust between peoples of different colors during a time in our country's history where we should all be sticking together, then by all means buy this and have yourself a hardy-har-har!

It IS funny and it would be getting 4 stars if he could lay off off the racism, but then, name a black comedian of this generation who can... good luck.",1109030400,6,1788,4.475460122699387
2064150,5,B00026L9BQ,"Chris Rock comes through again with Never Scared, his follow up to Bigger and Blacker. The DVD is non-stop laughs, with Chris Rock taking swings at everybody from strippers to the President.

2064151,2,B00026L9BQ,"The Woody Allen Syndrome hits, as Rock decides he must be ""serious"" and ""meaningful."" He uses his angry-young-man persona to educate us about affirmative action, George W. Bush, and marriage.  Without his occassional stacatto use of ""mf-er"" as noun, verb, adjective, and adverb - there would be only two or three laughs on this DVD.  Very disappointing.",1107129600,5,353,5.175438596491228
2064152,5,B00026L9BQ,"Chris Rock is probably the Funniest and Smartest comdeian around. All of his comedy is halarious but most of his quotes have a lot of truth behind them like this one ""They don't arrest anyone who kills rappers. Only the good ones are dead Biggie Smalls dead, Tupac dead, Vanilla Ice Still Alive"". And his take on gay marriage : ""people always say we can't have gay marriage becuase marriage is a a scared instution that happens in the church it scard. No its not. Not in America where we watch 'The bachelor' 'The bachelorette' 'who wants to marry a millionare' and who wants to marry a midget' get the outta here. gay people have the right to be as miserable as everybody else"". I like that he tackles important issues in America and puts a comedic spin on them",1106697600,4,762,4.45
2064153,4,B00026L9BQ,"Now it's just my opinion, but whilst reading others reviews for Never Scared, I couldn't help but notice how everybody that gave lower ratings to this release spent a lot of time comparing it to his prior stand ups. I would just like to point out that if Chris Rock kept doing stand ups that were mirror images of Bring The Pain, and Bigger and Blacker, that his routine would quickly become redundant and old. I'll be the first to admit that I don't especially enjoy Never Scared as much as BTP and B&B, but by no means is it a disappointment. People can rant and rave all they want about how it's not ""vintage"" Chris Rock, and it's not as ""in your face"". Personally, I think he's still very 'in your face', and though the issues he elaborates on may have become more serious and political, it's still very much Chris Rock.

For the DVD itself, I consider it well above average. Chris Rock definitely hasn't lost his ability to point out the obvious while still managing to make people look stupid. He speaks of many current issues, such as the Michael Jackson case, Janet Jackson, Kobe Bryant, George Bush and the war in Iraq, and much more. And like his prior two specials, he ends it with a completely hilarious segment on relationships and women, that will surely make men laugh their behind off (and many women too) , and shake their head in agreement at the same time.

All in all, despite this being the weaker of his stand-ups, it's still an above average special, and still quite worthy of adding to your Chris Rock collection. 8.5/10.",1106352000,,1545,4.514285714285714
2064154,5,B00026L9BQ,This DVD was hilarious.  I am glad that some people were outraged and offended because the truth hurts.  The bit where he talks about only white people being able to profit from pain was an incredibly keen observation that was hilarious (could you imagine if jerri curl having blacks actually invented and sold cigarettes..one of the most lethal products on the market?  The villafication of the black race would be enormous).  The man is genius.,1105315200,5,446,4.906666666666666
2064155,5,B00026L9BQ,"Did Chris Rock make me laugh? - ah-hell yes!!! I never felt he ran out of material - he didn't dwell - he didn't rely on the ""default"" of sexual content to carry him.  He just made me laugh.  The fact that he always seems to have sharp insight into what he is talking about makes it all the more better.  I loved it and I hope he comes out with more",1103500800,4,349,3.8194444444444446
2064156,2,B00026L9BQ,"Apparently, 80 minutes proved to be way too much time for Chris Rock. His first was the best at 56 minutes. The second special was not as good but still great at 65. Then he gives us this. Eighty minutes of ZZZzzzzzzzz.
I love Chris Rock's style of comedy. His ""in your face, but not aimed AT YOUR face"" profanity and unique delivery has made him the ""blueprint"" for other stand up comics. (Notice how comedy central stand up specials sound more and more like CR shows?). Now, after the high standard that he set for himself, It wouldnt be a surprise if he slips a little bit. Maybe another Bigger and blacker. I mean, how does one top Bring the pain? Now adoring Chris Rock so much actually made it painful to see him perform Never scared. Watching him tell his jokes in front of a yawning Washington crowd reminded me of the time Tyson got knocked out by Buster Douglas. Just when you thought the guy was invincible, he ends up picking up his mouth-piece from the ring.

I felt sorry for the man as he went through his routine. If this was some unknown comic you were watching in an old New York basement you might find this routine decent. But no! C.R. is stand up royalty and what he put on this disc just ain't worthy of him. There were some portions that were still reminiscent of his old self. The ""mock the celebrities"" and ""Nelson Mandela"" part was pretty hilarious. Everything else is filler. And I'm talking about wasted tape (wasted disc space if you bought the DVD).

Now I'm asian. It shouldn't bother me that he makes fun of white people. Hell, I laughed my ass off of his white-black jokes on his first two shows. But the way he spit it out on Never scared is just disgusting. It's disgusting how he reffered to the NFL blacks as descendants of negro super-slaves. It's disgusting how he talked about how only the white man can profit from pain. It's freakin disgusting when he started to explain why we shouldn't fear Al Quaeda when he asked the crowd ""did Al-Quaeda put Anthrax in your mail...no! did Al-Quaeda blow up the building in Oklahoma...no!""

He sounds like a black Adolf Hitler preaching about the evil things that white people do. I wouldn't be surprised if Osama cut clips from this show for his next anti-US propaganda video. There are more claps than laughs from the crowd and thats bad if you're a stand-up comic.

I hope this is not a preview of things to come.",1102723200,10,2395,4.44874715261959

2064160,4,B00026L9BQ,"Watching a Chris Rock act is like attending a lecture on the history of American race relations from the funniest professor on the planet.  This is yet another example that stand-up comedy can be a true artform.  Many comics can make me howl, but few change my perceptions.  Rock provides real insight into why some dangerous drugs are illegal (they're non-white, non-American made) while others are legal (they're white American made). For those who criticize Rock for too much white-man bashing, I say they need to watch again.  Rock equally blames his own people for their lack of wealth.  ""When white people get rich, they build Wal-Marts so that other people can make some money too and build wealth.  When black people get rich, they buy jewely.""  Need more?  ""Maybe we could build some more wealth in this country if we weren't too busy spending all our money on rims.""  This is Rock at his best and most unique.  In all of Rock's shows he's been willing to lay some of the blame for black problems at their own doorstep in addition to his devasting critiques of racist government policies.  How often do Jesse or Al have the courage to do that?",1098748800,6,1152,4.653465346534653
2064167,4,B00026L9BQ,"Though he has yet to find a movie role that accurately reflects it, Chris Rock is one of the sharpest, shrewdest comics working today.

In his live act, he tackles social issues with the same skewed zest Richard Pryor had in his heyday, and he can work a crowd or a joke with the same skill Eddie Murphy used to command. ""Never Scared,"" his fourth live HBO special, bears that out.

Filmed in April at Constitution Hall and just released on DVD, the show finds Rock mouthing off about rap, racism, marriage, Michael Jackson, the war in Iraq and the difference between being rich and being wealthy.

The hour-and-20-minute rant is a potent combination of Rock's expletive-peppered wit and his almost pulpit-pounding delivery, and it's not going to be for everybody - some will laugh out loud, some will roll their eyes - but by now anyone remotely familiar with Rock knows what they're going to get from one of his performances.

""Never Scared"" doesn't quite scale as high as 1999's ""Bigger and Blacker"" (a harangue about married life eventually gets a little redundant), but those who enjoy Rock's brand of grinning, cheery-eyed pessimism will be more than satisfied.",1098316800,2,1167,4.849246231155779
2064168,4,B00026L9BQ,"Chris Rock - Never Scared is the fourth time he has appeared in an HBO special. It's a very unique comic performance. Filmed at the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, DC, the show starts off slowly, with Rock doing material about strippers and rap music that really is more nasty than funny.

But he quickly gets back to the hilarity when talking about Michael Jackson and the King Of Pop's relatives, as well as NBA baller Kobe Bryant and RNB star R. Kelly. The laughs come fast and furious through the middle of the show in a big, big way!

However, the surprise comes in the second half when the concert changes again, and this is where the routine becomes almost too true to be funny. Rock prowls the stage and talks of some very serious topics from some very intriguing angles. He's almost preaching a sermon when speaking of the difference between ""rich"" and ""wealth."" His points about marriage and Affirmative Action could be put in a Sociology textbook! It's simply brilliant  and razor sharp commentary.

Rock claims his place as the top stand up in the country with this performance. As an extra treat, you get to see Rock's first HBO special, included as a bonus.

Rock is at his funniest when he illustrates those ridiculous things in life that some view as normal.  His bit on Rap is introspective in some ways especially when about dead rappers.

It's hard not to let out a chuckle when he talks about his job as father is to keep his daughter off the pole and some of the remarkably silly things strippers claim as their reasons for stripping.

About an hour goes by and a strange thing happens.  Well, maybe not strange if you're a Chris Rock fan.  Toward the end of the show, perhaps the last 20 minutes or so this routine spirals toward the ground in a total comedy flat spin.  In this section of the routine the profanity is so bitter, the conversation about sex is so filthy and the ""jokes"" so stale that I was left sitting there wondering why I had watched it.  OK, I'll admit it; I shut it off during the last five minutes.

The one thing Rock has seemed to forget is it's his job to entertain the audience, not embarrass them and I can tell you I was embarrassed watching this one.

Someone should wake Chris up and tell him that every other word out of his mouth doesn't have to be hardcore profanity to garner an appreciative audience.  In doing so you are not impressing your audience but offending them.",1094688000,9,1434,4.345864661654136

-Good intro and ending, but that in between was really long.

-Too much zooming around at the crowd to show their reaction.  Sure, out of 10,000, your going to have some people laughing.

It's almost as if he's trying very hard to prove that, despite his enormous success, he's still a person on the fringes of society.  Instead of being a voice for positive social change, he seems resigned to the fact that the underdog can never win, and it leaves the entire special with a very negative feel.

Never Scared is not even close to being as funny as Bring the Pain or the side-splitting Bigger and Blacker.
