8480388,5,B005NF2UUK,"This movie is a hidden Aussie gem.  It is a delightful story of thirty-somethings longing for true love.  It stars a young Sullivan Stapleton who later gained fame among TV viewers in programs such as Strike Back and Blindspot.  WARNING TO SUSHI EATERS:  You may want to fast forward through the hilarious party scene halfway through the film.  I have watched this film several times, enjoying its subtle charms every time.  I even bought additional copies for my daughters.",1512777600,,474,4.936708860759493

8480392,5,B005NF2UUK,"The only positive to this movie was Sullivan Stapleton. The female lead needs to find another line of work. The story could have come off fun and quirky, but it just came undone instead. Disappointed!",1365465600,,200,4.742857142857143
8480393,2,B005NF2UUK,"The ending is not fully satisfying. There are some redeeming bits in the film, but this story could have been much stronger with significant changes. Don't pay a lot to watch it. I saw it on Netflix.",1346371200,,199,4.405405405405405
8480394,1,B005NF2UUK,"The movie itself is very run of the mill and humdrum.

The video quality is slightly woolly and there are no subtitles or captions on the disc, so very poorly presented from a technical and accessibility standpoint.",1344988800,2,215,4.8108108108108105
