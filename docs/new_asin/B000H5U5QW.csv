8136434,5,B000H5U5QW,"A wonderfully honest portrayal of a newly-retired, newly-empty-nest, very-sexually-secure couple entering into the marriage-enriching world of swinging (not cheating). Seduced into a night of (full-soft?) swapping by a woman and her blind husband (director motivation - eye opening experience, accidental encounter, or both?), the couple must come to grips with the fact that (separately and as a couple) they have been 'curious and ready' for such an experience. A second 'chance' encounter with another secure, sexually-open couple expands their options further! A feel-good, sexually open movie (rarely do we see an erotic film where sex doesn't have to be 'punished' with guilt, depression, danger, murder, farce, etc.) - really HOT! We loved seeing a loving, happily-married couple making shared fantasies a reality - a realistic reflection of modern-day swinging. The only unrealistic part of this movie - dinner with friends (and a stranger-couple) turning sexual 'by chance'. Enjoy the Lifestyle!",1231459200,6,1004,5.7
8136435,4,B000H5U5QW,"It took FOREVER to receive this movie from the seller but almost 2 months later it finally arrived.  I was hoping since Daniel Auteuil was in this movie that it would be good...but uhh...it's a movie about swingers.  There wasn't a lot of information about the plot of the film but this is not a typical French movie like ""Le Placard"" (The Closet) or ""Apre Vous"".  The first half of the movie went okay I guess but the characters always looked uncomfortable.  Then all of a sudden Daniel's wife goes upstairs with Adam (the husband from the other couple)?!  It came totally out of nowhere.  The next 15 minutes left me totally confused.  Once I figured out they turned out to be swingers it made sense but then the rest of the movie just died....no movement of plot, no drama, no comedy...nothing.  And then all of a sudden the movie is over.  It was a waste of some good talent and money and time I spent waiting for this film.  Don't bother with this one.",1190160000,12,957,4.417142857142857
