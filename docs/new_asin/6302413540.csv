461136,5,6302413540,"""I Live My Life"" is one of Joan's very best love stories from the 1930's. Joan plays Kay Bently, a socialite who tries to make a relationship with an archaeologist. I really like this movie because although it is similar to those typical love-story/love-triangles that MGM/Joan did, it also seems unique and very original. The performances by all are second to none. This movie came out 4 months after Joan's other picture from 1935, the hard-to-find, ""No More Ladies."" You really must see this movie if you have any interest in Joan Crawford or classic pictures.",1208217600,2,563,4.875
461137,3,6302413540,"Joan Crawford plays Kay Bentley, a spoiled rich girl who meets archaeologist Terry O'Neill, played by Brian Aherne when she falls into his dig site, while catching a breather off her family's yacht in Greece.  Terry has a problem with bored society girls like Kay, so she presents herself to him as a secretary working for the wealthy family on board the yacht.  As quick as can be expected in a 97 minute film, Kay goes back to her life, with Terry following her to New York and accepting a position in her family's company as a Vice President and finding out right before the wedding that executive life is not for him.  His fight with Kay prompts her to go about destroying her bedroom and (gasp!) her pristine white wedding gown.  They make an ""only in the movies"" agreement that, to save face, Terry will show up at the church the next day, only to be stood up by Kay.  However, Kay has a change of heart overnight and shows up anyhow, in a quickly mended dress (it's amazing what fresh flowers can do)and while the couple bicker in front of the priest and assembly, they do end up married.  Although you have to wonder how long this union will last.

Crawford is lovely, her outfits are wonderful eye candy and she appears to be having a joyous time on this picture.  Brian Aherne is so good as Terry, in addition to being a nice looking guy, that it makes you question why he never became a star.

Jessie Ralph in the role as Kay's crotchety old grandma, who would make Hitler run in fear, is great entertainment.

All in all, a nice, frothy, bubbly glass of 1930s champagne.",1113350400,10,1582,4.424137931034482
461138,4,6302413540,"Joan plays Kay, a devil-may-care New York debutante who is mired in ennui.  She travels to Greece and meets Aherne, a bright archaeologist with naught but disdain for the society crowd.  Aherne, however is taken with Kay's flirtatious ways and follows her back to the States where he finds himself totally out of place with the hedonistic circle of friends Crawford introduces him to.  However, Kay's grandmother (Jessie Ralph) takes a shine to Aherne, thinking he may be just the ticket to take Crawford out of her dissolute life... The fairly witty script was written by Joseph Mankiewicz and Van Dyke's brisk direction gives the film a snappy pace. Stylish, chic, and often witty, I LIVE MY LIFE is typical of the Crawford pictures of the era as they parade her in several sophisticated outfits, give her some sharp lines to say and let her nibble - not chew - the scenery.",1031702400,10,876,4.75

7825494,4,6302413540,"Amusing film with Crawford showing a real flare for comedy and director Van Dyke setting up a lightweight script to its best advantage.

Crawford plays a bored and perhaps spoiled society girl who meets her match in archaeologist Aherne. There's also a plethora of MGM supporting stalwarts including Frank Morgan, Arthur Treacher, Jessie Ralph, Fred Keating and Eric Blore. Crawford and Aherne work very well together here and it's a shame they were not paired for other films.

This is not anything even remotely resembling a ""heavy"" film, but one of many light comedies in the wake of ""It Happened One Night."" Innocuous, fun and breezy, it's a nice way to pass 100 minutes.",1405123200,3,675,4.912280701754386
7825495,2,6302413540,"Do you love Joan Crawford? Do you love mile high eye lashes? Do you love 30s finger waves? Do you love obnoxiously overdone Adrian gown necklines? Then this is the movie for you.

My favorite part of this film is the beginning with Joan as a feisty heiress, falling down holes, and pretending to be hurt, so she can be carried by a handsome archeologist. My least favorite part is... everything else. The plot is terrible. And although it has some great lines and moments, this is not Joe Mankiewiczs best piece of writing, thats for sure. Joan really was the best part of this film. I hated everyone else (unusual for me - I always like her supporting cast of characters in these 30s films). I didn't even like her love interest. He was so dull and quite the pretentious prick for being so blue collar. Joans character was undoubtedly an unlikable, spoiled brat, but at least she was visually captivating and fun to watch. I was shocked by her beauty, yet again. I think this might be one one of my top five ""looks"" for her. (If you cut those damn lashes in half - distractingly long!) And I adored her hair styled that way. Seriously, I'm not even kidding, there is nothing else worth talking about with this movie. Just play it on silent, skip to all her scenes, and just WATCH her.",1401148800,2,1285,4.444915254237288
7825496,1,6302413540,"And if you're Joan Crawford, you want to avoid subpar, unfunny scripts from Joseph L. Mankiewicz. A real dud, I Live My Life flatlines right from the start, due to miscast leads, uninspired scripting, and leaden direction. A big miss.",1400371200,,234,4.875
7825497,3,6302413540,"If you like Joan Crawford, this movie is worth watching to see her at her peak of beauty and wearing Adrian's extravagant (although in this instance pretty ugly) designs. She is regal and full of attitude and she commands every scene. MGM was known for having ""more stars than there are in the heavens"" and Joan certainly earned her place at the top of their roster.

The story, on the other hand, is inconsequential and truly quite ridiculous. Joan decides she'd like to see Greece before her yachting party leaves without so much as casting an eye toward the country, so she rents a donkey and rides around. She stumbles upon an archaeological dig where Brian Aherne is working to unearth a Greek statue. She flirts and feigns an injury so he will literally carry her back to town. But she's only faking, and this only contributes to his believe that women with yachts aren't worth his time. She sticks around an extra day to see him again, and the effort makes him believe her feelings are genuine, but she's only playing. Their strange back and forth continues in America and somehow they decide it'd be a good idea to get married. (I think it's just a ploy to get Joan into not one but two--ugly--wedding dresses.)",1389830400,,1219,4.617511520737327
7825498,5,6302413540,"I Live My Life is a fine motion picture starring Joan Crawford, Brian Aherne and Frank Morgan and they all turn in wonderful performances! In fact, the acting by all is very convincing and even though some people say Brian Aherne was somewhat miscast I think he does look like an archeologist! The choreography and cinematography reflect good judgment and the musical score, while not extensive since this is not a musical, also enhances the film. The plot moves along at a good pace although they could have cut a minute or two here and there; but the film is very well done so this becomes a minor quibble.

When the picture starts, we meet bored, spoiled New York socialite Kay Bentley (Joan Crawford) who is cruising the Greek islands on the family yacht with her father G.P. Bentley (Frank Morgan), G.P.'s old pal ""Doctor"" (Frank Conroy) and their butler Grove (Eric Blore). Kay gets an urge to get off the yacht at one of the islands and she rides a mule for fun--all the way onto an excavation site where archeologist Terence ""Terry"" O'Neill (Brian Aherne) is having his men dig up and dust off a fabulous sculpture from 4th century Greece. At first, Kay and Terry don't quite hit it off although Kay begins to have some feelings for Brian; she tricks him into thinking she's merely a secretary because she sees he hates people living the high society life. However, it isn't long before Kay and Terry do fall in love with each other--and when Kay leaves for New York, Terry follows her to propose marriage.

But when Terry gets to New York he's in for some big surprises! He discovers that Kay lied to him about being a secretary; this creates some tension between Kay and Terry but Terry tries very hard to adjust to Kay's lifestyle. Of course, there are even more complications: Kay is supposed to be marrying Gene Piper (Fred Keating) partly to get a huge sum of money from her irascible grandmother, Mrs. Gage (Jessie Ralph). Kay and Terry, however, are falling more and more in love with each other much to Gene's chagrin. Kay hopes her father can help her financially if she marries Terry but when G.P. loses a huge sum of money himself and can't support anybody it looks like Kay may have to marry Gene to please her grandmother and keep living that ritzy lifestyle.

There's more to the plot than what I've told you; I'll stop here so you can watch and enjoy this movie as much as I did! Suffice it to say that the rest of the picture shows how everything plays out and there are more than just one or two surprises!

Look also for solid performances by Aline MacMahon as Betty Collins, Terry's associate; Arthur Treacher as Gallup, Mrs. Gage's butler; Esther Dale as Mrs. Gage's housekeeper; Sterling Holloway as Max and Hilda Vaughn has a brief cameo as Miss Ann Morrison. Look closely and you'll see Hedda Hopper as Alvin's Mother.

I Live My Life is a fine motion picture for fans of the actors in it. In addition, people who enjoy romantic dramas with some comedy thrown in for a good effect will not be disappointed.",1365465600,2,3038,4.56697247706422
7825499,5,6302413540,"""I Live My Life"" was one of two films Joan Crawford released in 1935, the other being ""No More Ladies"". In this outing Joan plays a rich sophisticated woman who meets a man in Europe and they fall instantly in love. When they return to the United States the man is very uncomfortable in his wife's role as a society matron and can't seem to fit in with her crown.

 This type of role Crawford embarked on was very similar to other performances of hers during that era: playing rich women who had made it big by clawing their way to the top.

 Joan, however, loathed this film like ""No More Ladies"". Saying in the early 1970's, ""The only thing I want to remember about it (""I LIve My Life"") are the costumes by Adrian.",1347667200,4,717,4.288888888888889
7825500,4,6302413540,"I LIVE MY LIFE is a comedy that is just a hairsbreath from the darkness that accompanies the gloominess of stark drama.  Director W. S. Van Dyke tells the tale of Kay (Joan Crawford), a rich and spoiled heiress who saunters off to Greece and meets a solid down to earth archaeologist Terry O'Neill (Brian Aherne) who promptly falls for Kay but despises her snooty upper class elitism.  Much of the film's comedy revolves around his being the poor fish out of water trying to survive in an elaborate fishbowl of luxury.  There are several scenes that show Terry trying mightily to fit in but failing miserably.  He is promoted to a vice president of his future mother-in-law's firm and on his desk is a series of buttons, none of which he understands but all of which he pushes to admit a wave of toadying underlings.  Crawford handles her share of the comedy with skill but her very ability to emote comedy arises from her talent to show that the snobbery that Terry thinks is ubiquitous in her world is not simply in his overworked imagination. Kay loves him but she has no problem dumping him when she realizes that her marriage may result in her father's disinheritance from a mean grandmother, well played by Jessie Ralph.  There is more than a small amount of the serious business of two persons contemplating marriage who know that the social divide between them is huge and may be insurmountable.  Everyone involved tells both Kay and Terry that their marriage is doomed. Kay tells Terry so and he returns the sentiment.  But all this undertow of realism is kept in the background by a steady string of wit and verbal comebacks that serve to remind us that this film belongs in the light and frothy world of romantic comedy.  I LIVE MY LIFE is not Crawford at her edgiest.  Here her talent is subordinated to delivering a message that true love can indeed win out even against insuperable odds.  And that keeps it firmly in the realm of comedy.",1262476800,,1951,4.609826589595376
