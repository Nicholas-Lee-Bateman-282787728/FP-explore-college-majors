Deborah Garcia(widow of Jerry Garcia) shows what is going on in the Corporate agriculture world. There must come a point where man says ""Haven't we screwed things up enough, is profit more important than what is right and just?""

The corruption that is engulfing the whole agriculture community is unreal. If grown properly and organically there should be no need for fertilizers and pesticides. If the soil is mineral rich than crops should grow unhindered. Read ""One Straw Revolution"" by Masanobu Fukoka, if you can get your hands on a copy. He explanes thoroughly how to grow crops naturally with as little human intervention as possible.

Monsanto has no respect for human life, they will continue to spread their poison as long as they reap profits.  It is up to the consumer to say enough is enough.

Not only does this film show in detail the insanely disgusting science behind how genetically modified foods, but exposes some of the practices that are carried about by evil, yes I mean truly evil companies like Monsanto - from how they are infecting the planet with they're genetic abominations, and how they are actively and directly destroying the real down to earth, moral farmers' lives. If you watch this film it will make you mad, and it should.  Companies like Monsanto and all their minions need to be thrown in prison - the level of their psychopathic, twisted, behavior is truly shocking (there really are no words to encapsulate it) , but people need to become aware of what is really happening and what they are really doing. This film is definitely a must watch for anyone with a conscience and a heart, and who cares about what they are putting in their bodies and their children's bodies, and what is really being done to God's creation.  I say anyone involved with Monsanto pushing this agenda should not only be put in jail, but their diet for the rest of their days should be the very same genetic abominations they are pushing on the rest of the world through blackmail, deceit, and financial terrorism.",1386547200,2,1330,4.651063829787234

2436499,5,B000BQ5IXM,"I just watched The Future of Food, and I recommend that you see this film.  It is beautifully shot, the music is pure pleasure, and the information is what we need to insure that our food system provides us food security, that is, that we will have food in the future!

It explores how genetically engineered crops, also called genetically modified organisms, are a threat to our food security.

Very importantly, it dispels the myth of genetically modified foods being an answer to world hunger.

And it tells how the genetic modification of fish could lead to their extinction in forty generations.  Good to know!

Do you want to know what it would take to make farming sustainable and improve human health?  There are viable alternatives to the industrial food model. This film explains how growing organically creates a system providing food that is diverse, healthy, and sustainable. Ecological agriculture and organic farming are the real alternatives to the world food crisis. The consumer is king, and needs adequate information because our choices at the market determine the future of food.  We need diversity for food security; only through rejecting the industrial food system will we have it.

The film ends with the statement, ""It's up to you."" This is an important film because although it may surprise you with the enormity of the threat to the future, it will inspire you with the hope provided by the solutions that are expanding continuously, and it could lead to choices that improve your health.",1377561600,,1516,4.9604743083003955

The interviews and statistics are the least jaded and most factual/interesting of all the popular food documentaries (Forks Over Knives, Vegucated, King Corn, etc.), though it is still a very one-sided depiction of a complex issue.

I thought this documentary would have a lot to say about the negative health and environmental concerns about GM crops. It started off describing GM crop development in an informative, science-y way and had a little to say about health and biodiversity impact, but quickly started focusing solely on legality, business methods, lack of regulations, labeling, etc. While the latter issues are all important, and I'm sure they were all relatively new concerns back in 2004, I was disappointed with the lack of information on how GM crops may impact our health. The documentary seemed to use some scare tactics to try to make it's argument about how ""bad"" GM crops are for your health. Still, I'd love to see GM-labeling initiatives approved, but I need more information on health issues to make me want to pay more for non-GM.",1367107200,,912,4.852564102564102
2436505,4,B000BQ5IXM,"The Future Of Food, an 88 minute long documentary, released in 2004, and directed by Deborah Koons Garcia, wife of the late founder of the 1960s rock band, The Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia, is a film that rehashes many of the same points made in the earlier films, yet also goes a bit more deeply, penetrating into the web of how Monsanto, and other agribusiness giants weave a web of control and oligopoly that reverberates up and down the food chain, and puts the squeeze on the small, family farmer, even waging a war on them. The film shows how a Canadian farmer named Percy Schmeiser stood up to Monsanto and was ruined by a corrupt Canadian judiciary (although, if one follows the link provided, it seems that Schmeiser actually got the upper hand in 2008!).

  The film also details how these corporate thugs, mostly in the petrochemical and insecticide and herbicide industries, have cornered the market in the seed industry, and how ridiculous patent laws have allowed the first company with the idea to patent natural plants to do so, and how they have tried to standardize patent laws worldwide so that an American or French company could somehow dictate the agricultural and food policies of developing and Third World nations, in a sort of corporate colonialism that is bound to engender not only health, but political, problems in the future. The destruction of native cultures is just part of the problem, for the larger issue is the absurdity of patenting life itself, and stating that Crop X belongs to a foreign company, thus allowing foreign interests to lay economic and legal rights to products they had no part in cultivating, while also allowing these unevolved and monoculture crops great range and susceptibility to droughts and pests they cannot fight off, for even Monsanto's Round Up Ready soy beans are showing their limitations as a food source, whereas Mexico's natal and diverse forms of corn, which occasionally remix with wild and progenitor breeds prove hardier and more resistant than the genetically modified corn from north of the border.

  The film also brings to light what is called the Terminator Gene that has been developed in certain crops, which was designed so that limits on crops could more easily maintain crop process. The utter folly of this, were these strains to become dominant, is that famine would be rampant, and the very development of such a gene, alone, should be enough to convince any legislative body of the folly of allowing corporate empty suits to have any say in the vital national security issue of feeding the masses. All in all, The Future Of Food is likely the best and most information rich of these documentaries in conveying the scope and depth of the issues surrounding America's insane agricultural process.",1359676800,,2784,4.912765957446808

2436510,5,B000BQ5IXM,"This video delves into the history of and the pros and cons of genetic modification of food. While artificial selection has been employed by botanists and agriculturalists for thousands of years, it is only in the past half century that we have the technology to strategically design plants (and animals) through modification of their DNA.

While our new abilities must be evaluated in the light of ethics considerations, the behavior of large corporations must be evaluated in the light of moral and legal considerations. Monsanto and other large corporations have been registering patents on genetically modified crops, and enforcing liability for wind-scattered genetically modified seeds found on non-customers' properties.

We should be aware of the activities of the corporations that profit from manipulating and attempting to ""own"" nature, and who are simultaneously decreasing biodiversity in agriculture, putting the entire world food supply at risk. Morgan Spurlock vastly advances our knowledge and awareness of these issues in this film.",1347580800,3,1050,5.639240506329114
2436511,4,B000BQ5IXM,I used this as a video for my Foods classes to show how the production of foods have changed so dramatically from the time of their grandfathers to now. I really like the film myself; but my high school students did not seem very interested except for the graphic parts. I think they could leave a lot of the talk out; put more action in. We have been studing gentically modified foods so I thought this video would fit in perfectly but it was not quite the hit I thought it would be. I think it's for an older audience.,1346889600,,520,4.21
2436512,5,B000BQ5IXM,"This is an excellent exploration into what our food has become as well as the direction it's headed.  People of our society need to become aware of what they're eating through appropriate labeling on products.  In addition, we need to understand the consequences of our food choices.",1335571200,,283,5.0
2436513,5,B000BQ5IXM,"Documentary starts by telling us about the variety of rice, apples, and plant life that used to be grown for food. After the green revolution, agriculture became more systematized and monocultures were being grown. While this increased the production of food, it also made crops more vulnerable to blights. The green revolution became the gene revolution when companies like Monsanto started manipulating genes in crops and producing seeds which are immune to pesticides like Roundup. Later on, large corporations started patenting genes in seeds and they hold patents to even subsequent generations of plants with these genes. Large corporations are also patenting seeds, which haven't been genetically modified, as long as they haven't been patented before.

The patenting of seeds and life in such a way is scary. Monsanto is EVIL! for filing lawsuits against small farmers for patent-infringement on seeds. The way Monsanto is seeking to prevent farmers from saving their own seeds is ridiculous and horrific.

Large corporations are seeking to homogenize patent rules in all countries so that they can own the patent to plants world-wide and have farmers worldwide pay for growing those plants. Corporations have also introduced a ""terminator"" gene or ""suicide"" gene so after one planting, the seeds of the plant will no longer be viable and farmers won't be able to save seeds.

I also didn't understand the concern over genetically-modified food crops until I watched this documentary. If I understand correctly, plants have natural protections against their DNA being compromised. The way companies overcome these protections in order to introduce foreign genes into plants is by using bacterias, viruses to penetrate the DNA of these plants. The companies are now fighting against the labeling of genetically modified foods both because they are afraid consumers do not want GMO foods but also because that would introduce traceability. If people are harmed by genetically modified foods and there is labelling of such foods, people will be to establish databases of data documenting the links between GMO foods and adverse health effects. It's evil for corporations and their representatives to fight against such traceability and labelling of GMOS.

One fact that stood out for me from the documentary is that Monsanto employees and government regulatory agents are the same people. Talk about conflict of interest - our political system is compromised by powerful corporations who fight against regulation and oversight that would benefit the health and safety of the general public.

This documentary is eye-opening and interesting. Good for those interested in understanding current agricultural food issues (which should by be all of us since we all need to eat). This documentary is along the lines of Food, Inc. and The Botany of Desire (two other very good films addressing agriculture).

Btw, a lining of hope ends the documentary, as people in North America because more aware of food concerns, more people are buying organic and locally grown foods.",1334275200,2,3070,5.332644628099174
2436514,5,B000BQ5IXM,"If you have heard nothing about GMOs, this is a great documentary.
It is not a fast moving movie created for entertainment, it is a documentary which
helps you to understand what is happening to our food supply in the USA.
It will also help you understand why it is so critical right now to force the government
to label all GMO foodstuffs so that we know what we are buying and feeding our children.
We have the right to know.

 Today, an estimated 75 to 80% of processed food in the U.S.
  contains GMOs (genetically modified organisms). For the past 15
  years, Americans have been denied the basic right to know what's
  in our food, despite the fact that more than 50 countries around
  the world already require labeling of genetically engineered food.

  Even communist Russia and China label GMOs, allowing their
  citizens the fundamental right to know what they're eating!

  Why not the U.S.? Because giant biotech and seed companies like
  Monsanto have written the rules for our governmental regulatory
  agencies and paid billions in lobbying, public relations and
  campaign donations over the past two decades.

2436520,5,B000BQ5IXM,"As stated in this documentary, whoever controls the seed controls the food.  Unfortunately, because of an irresponsible ruling by the Supreme Court, that control has been taken over by Monsanto.  Because Monsanto was allowed to patent their seed, that has allowed Monsanto to bully small farmers into paying them, in the (inevitable) event their patented seed accidentally winds up in their crops, either by wind or by birds.  Farmers end up paying the fees to avoid a lawsuit...and those who fight back get drained in lawyer fees and are held up as an example to those who resist.

In this documentary, you're shown how foods are genetically modified as well as the dangers of eating genetically modified foods.  What results is not only efficiency at the expense of diversity in food, but also efficiency at the expense of health.
Monsanto, of course, tries to wash their hands of liability by saying it's FDA's job to test safety, but we're shown that when the FDA does protest, they get shut down.  And it doesn't help that former employees at Monsanto are now employed with the FDA.  Talk about conflict of interest.

It is up to the people to be proactive, and to protect themselves and their families; to become locavores, via gardening and farmer's markets. It is up to the people to spread the word on this vitally important subject, to their familes and friends, indeed to anyone who will listen.

But, whatever your viewpoints, whether you are pro-Monsanto or anti-Monsanto, there is concrete material in this movie that is worth knowing.  This is the only movie I've seen which explains in concrete and understandable detail, exactly what ""genetically modified"" means.  It explains how the recombination of DNA occurs, how it's inserted into the seed and how the seeds accept the modified DNA.  I'm leaving aside my own personal viewpoints here because I think that the nitty gritty science of this film appeals to a far broader audience than it might if I focused on the film's political aspect.  I do hope that people take the chance & watch it - either because of or in spite of the politics of the matter.

For us to willingly trust our health and lives to these companies, at the farmers' expense, is mind boggling.  I am very glad for the solution at the end of the film.
The main thing that bothered me about half of the film's agenda is that fingers were pointed and names were named but not all of them.  This film mentions the Reagan Administration, the first Bush Administration and the second Bush Administration.  They do have their fault and role in this,  but did the problem vanish when President Clinton was in office?  It is very irritating to think that someone might be stupid enough to buy that.  I'd like to know what the Clinton Administration did about this.
I am also very interested to know what President Obama is doing about this because I know the problem still exists today.

2436536,5,B000BQ5IXM,"This video should make you angry, if it does not ... you need to wake up.  The lawsuits that Monsanto has filed to attempt to destroy small farmers are verifiable.  The fact that major players in the company have transferred in and out of the EPA and Monsanto for years is on record.  The health concerns are valid.

You may recall in the early 80s the l-tryptophan scare, when it was removed from shelves.  People had developed a rare blood disease that proved fatal to many.  Upon investigation, it was determined that the l-tryptophan which caused this disease had been purchased from a foreign company, Showa Denko.  This company had biosynthesized the l-tryptophan from a GMO source product.  The usually harmless amino acid, harmless when produced from a natural and untampered source, had been rendered harmful and, in some cases, deadly.

When the DNA of a food source (its major identifying factor - as with human beings) is altered, our body no longer recognizes that food for what it is.  That is what makes GMOs dangerous.  That is why Europe has banned them.  They learned the lesson.

Don't be suckered into believing that agribusiness or Monsanto cares one fig about your health or well-being when they try to market ""gold rice"" as better for your health.  They care only about profits.  Thus, if they can modify a food to make it APPEAR fresh longer on the store shelf or manage to convince you that it is better for you, they will do so.  If it means that you, the consumer, are purchasing a food item that has not only lost most of its nutritive value, but may actually be harmful to you, they will do it gladly to line their wallets. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no desire to eat any food item that has had Round-Up added to it through the modification process.

I'd be curious to see whether or not the producers of GMO foods eat them.  I rather doubt it.",1271980800,4,1892,4.563798219584569

In the first place, you cannot regard genetically modified food as ""substantially equivalent"" to natural food, for the simple reason that in nature the exchange of genes between different species is impossible. In the second place, genetically modified food IS dangerous. The scientific investigation of Dr. Arpad Pusztai on Monsanto-potatoes produced serious harm to rats. Since this study was supported by Monsanto, he got fired within hours. Genetically modified foods are prohibited for human consumption in Europe and Japan. In the US, genetically modified foods are not fed to laboratory rats, but directly to the people. If you live in the US, YOU are the guinea pig. This film shows that this food can produce severe allergic reactions.

In the US, there were 0 acres with genetically modified crops in 1980, and they went up to a staggering 100 million acres in 2003, with soybean, corn, canola and cotton as the major crops. Tests are now being performed on the rest of the living community including fish, livestock, poultry, trees, etc.

Monsanto not only determines what consumers will put into their bodies in the US, since those foods are not labeled, but they also virtually took over all land where corn, canola, soybean and cotton is being produced. They even aggressively pursuit all family farmers who had a tradition of improving their seeds naturally, saving part of them for the next season. Some years ago, when we still lived in a world wherein justice prevailed, when a farmer had cattle, it was his duty to fence them in, in order to prevent them damaging the crops of his neighbors. Capitalism has gone so wild nowadays, and the power of the big corporations has increased so much, that corporations now change this ancient justice system in order to suit their needs. So we now find ourselves in a situation where inspectors of Monsanto are crossing the whole country to find genetically modified crops on land of farmers who are suffering from this cross pollination. Monsanto then accuses those farmers of the theft of their patent ! I hope I can live long enough to see one day, justice will prevail again, and Monsanto will be prosecuted for the genetic pollution of the farm land of the US and Canada, that is already affecting Mexico also.

This movie also shows that food engineering is not good for us. Genetic modification doesn't produce any nutritional value. Those foods are only good for Monsanto, so they can sell more Roundup. Now, they sell this technology as if ""it will help feed the world"". Nothing could be further from the truth. There is enough food in the world for everybody already, the point is that the hungry are too poor to buy food. On the other hand, Monsanto puts now a ""terminator"" gene into their seeds, so that seeds cannot be saved and used for a next harvest. The big question is : what's gone happen when all those ""suicide genes"" will cross pollinate with other crops around the world ? Will we then be feeding the world ?

2436543,5,B000BQ5IXM,"This DVD tells it like it is.  However, I warn you that the consequences of the practices seen on this DVD will make 9/11 seem like a weekend at an amusement park!  If you are not ready to do laundry immediately upon watching this DVD, please hold it for a time when you are ready to do the laundry.  I say this only because this DVD will not only make the blood in your veins congeal, but will make you p___ (urinate) and s___ (defecate) in your underwear!  Usually I am very mindful of social etiquette and niceties, but the gravity of the situation depicted herein warrants forgoing them.

If you live in a house with some yard space, your first reaction will be to buy non-GMO seed (while you still can) and plant your own food.  If like me you live in an apartment, you will want to put in your own container garden.  Such is the revulsion you will feel towards the manipulation of our food right at the very source, namely the seed's cellular level!

The practice of gene manipulation shown on this DVD will result in a crisis, never seen before in the history of the human race.  The food crisis component of this unimaginable crisis will only be a small portion.  We will have a resource crisis on every front! With ""terminator genes"" and non-labeling of foods they are basically feeding us ""approved"" poison.

Corporations such as Monsanto, DuPont, Con Agra, Smithfield etc play with fire and the rest of us burn.  Thanks to the US Congress and the venal politicians that infest the halls therein.  Instead of safeguarding our food supply at the very source, they actually give subsidies to the very people who are sending our aged population to an early grave, and helping raise a new generation of children who will be malformed at the cellular level.  We must not forget the adage that, ""We are what we eat!""  Hence if we take in GMO food, which has not been subjected to any sort of long terms studies despite the objections of FDA and other scientists, our children along with the rest of us will pay dearly for the profits of a few.

This DVD must be telecast via cable 24/7 around the globe, specially here in the USA.  We in America are intelligent but do not always pursue the source of facts on matters that deeply impact our lives.  As a result of this lackadaisical attitude we allow the crooked politicians to pass legislation that is not at all in our interest.

After watching this DVD, please do not let the status quo persist.  Please take action, however small.  Please do something - buy only organic when you can, buy locally grown produce, join a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture), write your congressmen, share this DVD, raise the awareness level.  This is a very important matter, its ABOUT FOOD, something we have to eat three times a day.  It is something that God has put on the planet for our well being and not for manipulation by a bunch of out of control corporations.  Its unbelievable that something like this can happen in a nation like the USA that considers itself to be the most ""civilized"" nation and ""policeman"" for the rest of the world!

When will the men in technologically advanced countries learn that it is futile to try and control or rule the world.  Numerous monarchs and regimes in history have tried, but all have failed.  Their empires last a few decades, and at most a couple of centuries, but after that they are blown in the wind.  The powerful men have a defective gene which makes him want to control everything.  In the past these powerful races colonized the world and took what did not belong to them, continents such as North and South America, Africa, large chunks of Asia, and all of Australia.  As if that were not enough, they gave the world its two most pernicious wars in WWI and WWII.  Even that was not enough, so they dropped the first and second atom bombs.  However, the events in this documentary will conclusively prove that the ""domination gene"" in the powerful race is still running unchecked!  I believe this hunger for control and domination stems from a deep insecurity.

I also recommend the following DVDs to anyone who reads this review.  I only recommend them because I consider them to be excellent.  They may save your life or those of your friends and family.

Alas, ""The Future of Food"" is not that. The content is critical for our time -- modern agriculture, with its promise of feeding the world, has not only not delivered on that idea but has polluted our environment, robbed us of nutritious food, impoverished our farmers, killed our biodiversity, and made us all sick and antibiotic-resistant. The interviews are riveting and relevant, and even though I am well-versed in the topic, I still learned quite a bit from the film. The problem is not in the planning or the topic, but in the execution. With a boring and distracting narration style, a complete lack of creativity, and sub-standard graphics more akin to a middle-school project than a professional film, the creators miss an opportunity.

You think you understand the problems with GM foods, but you probably don't, or probably don't understand them with the urgency you should.

Incredibly informative, devastatingly scary, intensely emotional, something every responsible consumer should see.

Pay no attention to the slightly bland opening few minutes of the film (which I believe is used as the preview for the online rental version of this film on Amazon) because the entire film does not have such a dry, informational tone.

Yes, she's deadpan, but I'd rather she be that than obviously biased and exceedingly hysterical.

This movie tackles the vast and complex issues of genetically modified foods, and focuses on Monsanto as a primary culprit in poisoning our children and our environment.

I tend to get frustrated with documentaries which only focus on large political problems which seem hopeless. However, this film did an excellent job covering all the bases.

The film goes into great detail on the health dangers of genetically modified food, and suggests some foods to avoid (e.g., ALL corn in the United States, including corn syrup and corn byproducts, should be avoided). It also goes into the science of how these huge corporations engineer these foods, without being too complicated. (e.g., did you know that E-coli is actually injected into some seeds? All these genetic modifications are okay to the FDA because there have been so many Monsanto CEO's appointed to the FDA).

The film does a great job interviewing farmers, and discussing the harms of genetically modified foods to farmers, and how huge corporations like Monsanto are putting them out of business. And finally, without being partisan, it goes a little bit into the politics behind our food industry, and compares our lack of oversight & deregulation to other countries.

The point of this movie is actually pretty simple - if we knew what was really in our foods, and what these genetically modified foods are doing to our bodies, our crops, our economy, etc., we would never agree to these toxic foods.

But don't be too alarmed - the film points out how to avoid eating many of the dangerous foods, and what we can do about it. The most important thing you can do is call or write your representative, and urge them to sign the ""Food Right to Know Act"", which has been introduced to Congress every year since 1999 (but doesn't yet have enough votes). This type of law is already in effect in most other industrialized nations in the world (including Mexico!), but not yet in the United States.

But I personally feel that everyone has a right to know what they're eating!! ...particularly children and seniors, who can get sick (or even die) very easily by eating foods with toxins. Farmers (as a general rule) are very honest and hard working, and most would gladly label their foods. But these multinational corporations will NOT do this on their own - and they are actually preventing farmers from honestly and truthfully labeling their foods (by threat of law suits, and gag orders). These CEO's are too greedy, and must be forced to tell us what's in their food products or we will continue feeding their toxic sludge to our nation's children and never know what's in it!",1240704000,4,2718,4.832258064516129

2436563,5,B000BQ5IXM,"I've noticed when I eat non-organic produce, upon slicing it open, my fingers where the juices get on itch tremendously. Non-organic produce sometimes make me feel more tired or irritable almost as bad as junk foods. Organic food always increases my energy, my mood, etc.
Here are some points I've jotted down quick (excuse the short-hand, I didn't have any intention to review until after the fact) from this film in the order of which is was presented:
Non-organic food has pesticides in it, worms & insects die when they eat it. We all know what kills insects will also kill us, just at a slower rate.
Monsanto put a patent on genes, so it owns it if it goes into plants, perhaps animals & who knows the future.
Normal organic seeds can now be patent as well, whoever gets there first. Farmers are no longer able to share, trade them like they did in the past thousands of years, saving seeds for the future years from their crops. This will cost farmers more. Companies now control the food.
Many years ago there were hundreds of different kids of apples, etc. but a large percentage of these different varieties have died out to only a few.
Farmers used to have many different kinds of crops in small amounts so that if there was a blight, drought, etc. all their crops would not be lost. But due to farming styles now, they only have one type & the economic devastation to that farmer is total.
Monsanto does stealth tests on farmer's land trying to find out if there are ANY GMO plants even if only a handful. If found any, they sue. The courts ruled in favor of Monsanto even if it was proven the GMO crops got there by birds, animals or wind. Many farmers had to destroy ALL their seeds, even the non-GMO ones. Anytime farmers did not want to fight, they had to pay a settlement & were not allowed to talk about the details.
In order to make GMO plants, they have to get the genes in there using VIRUSES & BACTERIAL, mostly E. COLI to invade the plant cells to cause tumors in the plants or electricity to create holes or even use gold laced with viruses.
There are ANTI-BIOTIC gene markers in pants.
The first Genetically-Modified Organisms produced sold in markets for humans were Flavor-saver tomatoes which consumers disliked the taste & was found to cause tumors in rats.
IN the US, the use of GM organisms is not needed to be labeled at all unlike all the European Union countries.
Major GM ingredients in packaged foods include corn syrup (causes diabetes & increased hunger) & soy lecithin (natural is from egg, soy type goes through a chemical process.)
Quayle gave Monsanto the same oversight as natural seeds/crops which is almost none. Ashcroft helped Monsanto win lawsuits. The FDA is run by many Monsanto executives.
Mexico runs smaller race crops near wild plants to keep their corn as viable & help the evolutionary process which has worked in keeping their crops from normal disease, etc. issues. They refuse to use GMO corn, but US seeds are half the price of non-GM corn due to agricultural subsidiaries.
The agriculture subsidiaries Bush signed in years ago mostly only helped to raise soy, wheat, corn & cotton the most GM crops.
60% of food is now GM.
Rats have depressed immune systems & growths from GM potatoes.
40% of the Monarch butterfly caterpillars died when fed BT corn.
There are many GM produce in the market: corn, rice, soybeans, tomatoes, rape seed, broccoli, sugar beets, barley, sunflower, pepper, etc.
The BREAST CANCER GENE has been patentent so that universities & other scientists looking for a cure have to pay a large fee to do their studies.
80% of the beef in the US is controlled by four companies.
There are only about four seed companies.
6 companies control almost all the retail food sold today, only one in the US - Wal-Mart.
Crops are now being tested that have the suicide gene - so that they can only be used one time, one year & the seeds from those crops are sterile and farmer would have to buy more seed for each planting. The US government owns that patent.
Certain GM plants actually NEED pesticides in order to make it grow at all.
Monsanto used the idea of starving people to say it will increase food supply to starving people since it will increase crop yields. This has not been proven to help starving, second, the crops were never tested at all in less ideal conditions like drought, disease, etc. Some GM plants actually has 25% less roots which means it would not survive drought as well as organic plants.
The first standards/guideliness that the US government listed for a product or plant to be considered ORGANIC included: irradiation, sewage sludge & genetically modified organisms.

What can you do?
Buy as much organic food as you can afford, it tastes better & will keep you healthier avoiding doctors & high cost drugs in the process. Supports your local farmers or add into a Community Supported Agriculture subscription where they grow smaller plots of many different kinds of produce & deliver to you baskets of produce on a weekly or monthly basis.

I read in the newspapers a couple of years ago of peas spliced with beans  genetically & given to rats. Almost all developed tumors & other digestive issues & conditions.
There has also been studies that proven that pesticides cause cancer & that organic plants have 40% more anti-oxidants then ones that have been sprayed with pesticides.",1212710400,2,5381,4.662105263157895

2436566,5,B000BQ5IXM,"The Future of Food documents what is currently going on with the food supply in the US. Monsanto, a multinational corporation who was formerly in the pesticide business (agent orange, ddt) is now one of the biggest seed suppliers in the world.  And not just any seed, it's genetically engineered for a number of purposes.

Monsanto has been suing farmers who have not bought seed from them but end up with it growing in their fields from no fault of their own. In one very well known case a farmer, Percy Schmeiser, was told by his neighbor that the neighbor's truck had a hole it's tarp and a lot of Monsanto's' 'round up ready' seed was dumped on his field. Monsanto tried to sue him (and many other farmers - google and you'll see links to many of the cases) and he spent his life savings fighting them. He just recently won his case after 10 years!

The film has wonderful and informative interviews with Andrew Kimbrell, director of the center for Food Safety, Fred Kirshenman, a well known sustainable farmer, and a number of experts and scientists who document first off how GE food was pushed on the American people with no disclosure and no testing as well as the devastating potential for destruction with messing with our food supply for profit.

There's a lot we can do. Support small farmers and farmers market's. Join a community supported agriculture program where you get a box of fresh from the field organic fruits and vegetables each week.  We also need to demand labeling. Right now we don't know which foods we buy are genetically altered and which aren't. If our food is labeled we can make informed choices.

2436579,5,B000BQ5IXM,"This documentary should be seen by anyone concerned with issues of corporate dominance and food safety.  While the health effects of genetic modification are not known, what is known is that the technology enables companies to claim ownership over seeds that were once considered a common good and shared among farmers.  Now, those traditional relationships of collaboration between farmers are being supplanted by Monsanto letters sent to farmers encouraging them to turn in any farmers who may be using patented seeds without permission.  Monsanto has even gone so far as to develop a ""terminator"" seed, a seed that will not reproduce; thus forcing the farmers to go back to Monsanto each year to buy more seed.  Thankfully, through the organizing done by famers and consumers at stores like Whole Foods, the corporate agenda of Monsanto has run into some snags; but their lawyers and lobbyists and marketers never rest - neither should we.

Patented GMOs are now being exported around the world.  While some countries and farmers associations have resisted, it can be difficult to avoid cross-polinization.  Traces of GMOs are now being found in Mexican corn strains, corn that represents centuries of innovation by farmers.
One of the many interesting parts of this film is the description of Mexico's corn culture - the local markets, the different sorts of corn they grow for different climates, and the different types of corn they use according to how it is being cooked.  It's ingenious, and a celebration of diversity.
The goal of agribusiness firms like ADM, Monsanto and Cargill is to homogenize and oligopolize.  It's a crime against farmers, consumers and the environment; but a great plan for maximizing profit and market share.
""The Future of Food"" is an excellent tool for raising awareness of this vital issue, one of many vital issues that the corporate media ignore.

2436586,3,B000BQ5IXM,"I worry about documentaries that get rave reviews but only show one side of the issue. And such was the case with THE FUTURE OF FOOD. Don't get me wrong, this film had some interesting information for viewers but it's very lopsided in presentation.

Its focus was on genetically engineered crops and how it affects everything from the seed to the dinner table. The film really goes after The Monsanto Corporation which is responsible for many lawsuits around the globe related to their patenting of a particular type of  ""Round-Up Ready"" seed. What this means is that the crop itself becomes toxic to certain insects but not to humans. This gives it an advantage in that the crop becomes more sustainable with possible higher yields. The problem is that never before has something living been given a patent. And when seeds from adjoining Monsanto product fields accidentally blow into non-Monsanto fields, the law gets extremely convoluted. Now a farmer who has never bought a Monsanto product suddenly begins growing Round-Up Ready crops, and Monsanto wants their money.

The documentary would lead you to believe that Monsanto was out to destroy the small, independent farmer, and this is a possibility. Maybe a bit of a stretch but certainly not something beyond the Big Business approach in today's capitalist market. It is also where the documentary begins to show some logical leaks. Not once are we shown an interview with a Monsanto representative (or even an attempt to get one) which gives The Future of Food its aforementioned lopsided presentation. If film makers want to be taken seriously, they have to be willing to risk ridicule from ""the other side."" This gives viewers the chance to discuss and research the topic and not simply force-fed (no pun intended) the documentary-makers' opinion.

The other issue with the film is that there was a section dedicated to the molecular make-up of certain genetically modified seeds. Although interesting and important, it went too far into microbiology and genetics for the average person (I've actually studied science so it wasn't too far of a stretch, but the non-scientific mind might have quite a bit of difficulty with it).

The ending of the documentary was probably the most interesting part, showing how the organic farmers are reaching out to communities via farmers markets and appropriate labeling (something that genetically modified developers do not want).

All in all this was very much a scare tactic approach to shock the viewer into action. Although this isn't as horrible as it sounds, anyone with half a brain will most likely wonder what Monsanto and other GM farming groups think about the entire subject. Unfortunately, through this film, we'll never know.

I will say that if even a fraction of what was presented here is true, then watching the film is worth your while. But I'd recommend doing some research afterward so that you get the entire picture.",1175904000,28,2939,5.02258726899384

Products that may contain genetically engineered potatoes or derivatives: unspecified processed or restaurant potato products (fries, mashed, baked, mixes, etc.), chips, Passover products, vegetable pies, soups. Fast-food chains appear to have responded to consumer concerns and requested genetically natural potatoes.

Dairy Products: Milk, cheese, butter, buttermilk, sour cream, yogurt, whey. You have to ask several questions when you are looking at dairy products. Have the cows been treated with rBGH? What kind of feed have they been given? If they are not being fed organic grains, chances are quite likely that they will be eating genetically engineered animal feed. What does this do to their milk products? No one knows.

Animal Products: Because animal feed often contains genetically engineered organisms, all animal products, or by-products may be affected.

and groundbreaking that I was shocked I had never heard of it.

When I first saw it, I was so fascinated by this carefully researched and informative film that I immediately told everyone I knew about it. I assure you, it will affect you too.  Debra Koons Garcia, formerly married to Jerry Garcia, has done an incredible job of covering the subject of genetically engineered crops, seed, food and everything you might want to know about

this crucial new field. She interviews farmers, severely affected by new laws and a Consumer Reports expert that in simple terms explains the science and its global ramifications.

It also explains the political aspects of why genetically engineered crops are being forced on the U.S. and the world and the government officials, who are at the heart of this corrupt corporate mess. It's all done without beating you over the head,

in a straightforward manner, with facts that are unassailable.

I am an award winning documentary producer, so it takes alot to impress me. She should have presented it for an Academy Award nomination.  It's so important a film right along with ""An Inconvenient Truth"", that every American should see it.

2436596,4,B000BQ5IXM,"Ms. Garcia has produced a frightening film showing us the future of our food.  Note, this film is focused on GMO crops, and does not really address other issues in agriculture today such as pesticide use, live stock crowding and abuse, etc, but that's okay, the film is scary enough as it is!

The film debunks many claims made by the GMO industry:

CLAIM: GMO foods are substantially equivalent to unmodified natural foods (which have been selected for specific genetic traits by farmers through the centuries).

REALITY:  Not true.  GMO foods are not simply human selection of genetic traits fast forwarded.  Rather, genes are introduced into cells by viruses and bacteria by processes that disrupt cellular, nuclear and chromosomal integrity. (note this process mimics the way we get certain diseases, such as cancer.)

For companies like Monsanto, GMO crops are substantially equivalent for the purposes of avoiding testing and regulations, but they are substantially 'different' so they can be patented!

CLAIM:  GMO foods are safe
REALITY:  No one really knows, because one, GMO companies do not have to test for safety, so there is no safety data prior to introduction of the product into the market, and two, GMO products are not labeled (because they are supposedly substantially equivalent to natural foods).  Thus, there is no way to link illness to eating GMO foods, because we do not know whether or not we are eating them!  There are some studies suggesting negative effects on animals such as rats and monarch butterfly caterpillars, and some (at times severe) allergic reactions in humans.  Not surprisingly, GMO companies dispute these claims.

Why no testing or labeling?  The film suggests its because many of the same people who work on government agencies that are supposed to regulate GMOs (EPA, FDA, USDA) have also worked or benefited from GMO companies, chiefly Monsanto.  Talk about a conflict of interest!

CLAIM:  GMO foods will help the third world avoid starvation by increasing production.
REALITY:  Increasing food production is not necessarily the answer, as there is too much food in the world already.  Food prices are so low that farming brings a net loss to farmers.  Western governments pay farmers subsidies to help them break even.  Not surprisingly, much of these subsidies are for GMO crops, ultimately benefiting GMO companies!  These foods are then dumped into the third world at rock bottom prices, displacing local farms and markets, which is likely one real cause of third world starvation.
COUNTER CLAIM:  GMO foods will help the third world avoid starvation by creating crops that fit the environment (ie, drought resistant, pesticide resistant, etc).
REALITY:  Such crops could perhaps be helpful (with the caveat above).  But GMO firms such as Monsanto are at least as interested in making seeds with `terminator technology' as they are in making crops that thrive in harsh conditions.  A crop with seeds produced with terminator technology produces sterile seeds, so the crop can only be grown one generation.  This would force poor farmers to buy the every generation of seeds from GMO companies, likely resulting in increasing starvation, not decreasing it!  Furthermore, this technology may spread due to cross-pollination to other fields, effectively destroying a farmer's crop in future generations without his or her knowledge or consent.  Terminator technology is one means by which GMO companies like Monsanto also are destroying genetic diversity so they can own the market.  But genetic diversity is crucial to survival of crops (and the rest of life!) from disease and pestilence...

The film also brilliantly explores the absurdity that has entered the patenting industry.  Now that individual genes can be patented companies are pushing to `own' whatever life form the gene transfers into.  Thus, you have hundreds of farmers like Canada's Percy who have been sued by Monsanto for patent infringement because Monsanto's RoundUp Ready Canola plants were found on their fields.  Percy and others claim that they did not want this product on their fields, and it grew because of contamination due to cross pollination.  This may or may not be the case (perhaps all these farmers are deceitful, as Brian Duerst suggests in his June 9th review), but the fact is, it doesn't matter.  According to the court verdict by Canada's Supreme Court, Percy and the other farmers would be just as guilty of patent violation if the canola found its way into their field due to cross pollination (and thus without their knowledge and consent) as if they had stolen the canola from Monsanto.

Other absurdities of patenting include patenting of natural, unmodified seeds (just be the first one to find a new wild type and get it to the patent office! I don't think God is getting any royalties...) and patenting of traditional knowledge such as tortilla making methods (I would like to know how much of the royalties go to Mexican street tortilla makers.)  Finally, one can buy unlabeled GMO corn for eating, but once that exact same corn is planted in the ground, one is violating the patent laws of the GMO company (even if one does not know it is GMO, of course).

Despite all these horrors, I don't think its wise to brand all current and potential future uses of GMO as purely negative.  The film is fair to say that GMO has been used in the medical industry for great benefit (human insulin production is one example).  The idea is not necessarily to wipe out GMO per se, but to tread very carefully.  Labeling products as GMO, so consumers at least have a choice, and health claims can be traced, is an absolute must.  Regulation is vital.

Why not 5 stars?  Several reasons:  One, the film's production quality was not as impressive of those of its cousin, THE CORPORATION.  The film had spectacular visuals, (the farm fields of Canada and streets of Mexico were fantastic), but the audio (including the narrator's voice) was not very impressive.

The explanation of genetic engineering was needlessly long and complex, causing my non-scientifically inclined family members to loose interest.  For example, did we really need to know the details of the three different bacteria, one virus and two or three different cellular disruption methods used to genetically engineer GMO products?  A simplified explanation (using one bacteria, one virus and and one cellular disruption method) would have been more than sufficient.

Finally, the film was not very well structured- it wandered from topic to topic without any real narrative coherence:  it  wandered from discussing patent issues to discussing genetic engineering (shouldn't this have come first?) to discussing harms to humans and animals caused by GMOs, to discussing Mexico- a land of crop diversity which could be destroyed due to GMOs, to discussing issues and problems caused by crop subsidies, to revealing the conflict of interest of government employees who are beholden to Monstanto, to discussing the dangers of corporate mergers.  Finally, it ended by promoting the purchase of organic food as a means to overcome the GMO problem.

The film could have given us other avenues to fight for the future of our food other than just buying organic.  Organic (or locally farmed goods) are either not available nor are viable options for many people.  Furthermore, consumer purchasing power is just one avenue for change:  while eating organic food may ensure we are not eating GMOs and promote non-GMO farming, we need to work on other fronts as well, such as advocacy for labeling and regulation, and for revision or revoking of harmful patents and patent laws.  We also need to work for justice for farmers and others who have been the innocent victims of the GMO mess, and for accountability and control of giant, powerful corporations.

However, in the end, these are small flaws, as the movie's material alone is incredibly compelling.  Watch this film, and prepared to be quite unsettled, if not down right frightened, regarding the future of our food.",1153958400,12,8072,5.077389984825493

2436598,5,B000BQ5IXM,"THE FUTURE OF FOOD is an in-depth investigation into the disturbing truth behind the unlabeled, patented, genetically engineered foods that have quietly filled U.S. grocery store shelves for the past decade and examines the complex web of market and political forces that are changing what we eat as huge multinational corporations seek to control the world's food system. This film is not just for food faddists and nutritionists. It is a look at something we might not want to see: Monsanto, Roundup and Roundup-resistant seeds, collectively wreaking havoc on American farmers and our agricultural neighbors around the world. Most people don't realize that genetically engineered foods have quietly slipped into much of the American food supply, mostly from corn and canola. They're in an estimated 60 percent of all processed foods. If this technology isn't challenged and if this corporatization of our whole food system isn't stopped, at some point all of the food crops will be contaminated and it will be too late.

At some point agriculture became industry, and then recombinant DNA technology upped the ante in the 1990s. Biotech breakthroughs allowed the gene-splicing of plants from different species or even plants and animals to create crops that resist disease or can withstand pesticides, even the ""terminator"" gene that kills off crop seeds after one season. Nationally, 100 million acres of GMO crops -- mostly corn, soy, canola and cotton -- were under cultivation by 2003. Chemical companies like Monsanto created Roundup Ready canola, and Bt corn with a spliced-in gene that makes its own insecticide. These chemical companies have succeeded in first patenting their own GMO seeds, and then slapping patents on a huge number of crop seeds, patenting life forms for the first time without a vote of the people or Congress. Thus letting new life forms loose on the land without long-term testing of the health effects and real government controls, especially labeling of foods.

In the film, Percy Schmeiser (Saskatchewan grain farmer) tells his story as one of the hundreds sued by Monsanto after pollen from the company's patented Roundup Ready canola from a nearby farm had drifted into and pollinated with his field. Monsanto accused Schmeiser of violating its Roundup Ready patent, even though Schmeiser never planted the GMO canola and didn't want it in his field. He fought the suit where many other farmers settled, but lost, and must now pay Monsanto to plant his next crop from his own seed. The film also travels to Mexico, where hundreds of varieties of corn thrive in different climates and soils, to show how GMO crops threaten such biodiversity. Here evidence is found that the genes of GMO corn had already jumped the border to contaminate native species. The uncontrolled spread of genetically engineered plants found far beyond the fields where they were planted is one of the strongest arguments the film makes for introducing safeguards.

The film questions why the U.S. government hasn't required GMO foods to undergo the rigorous testing required of medicines created by recombinant DNA technology, and why it has resisted efforts to require GMO labeling on foods, as Europe does. Suggesting an answer, the film ticks off all the government officials who have links to Monsanto, including Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld  and Attorney General John Ashcroft.

Ultimately, people need to think more about the consequences of their food choices and to use their consumer power to push for labeling and regulation. While some people are seeking to ban GMOs, others think labeling would drive GMO foods off the market, as it has in Europe. One thing is for sure, long gone are the days when ""we could grow healthy foods over here, and they could have their GMO  food over there.""  With genetic engineering, it is probable that over a short period of time, it would contaminate all natural food crops which could be extremely detrimental especially in cases where the terminator seed is involved. This is a big deal. If you care about your family make sure the foods they eat are non genetically modified. Currently the only way to do this is by eating organic since it is not required to list GMOs on the labels of your food. The largest crops of GMOs are corn, soy, canola and cotton. If you eat fast food YOU are eating GMOs. If you drink anything sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup, you guessed it, all GMOs. If you suffer from unexplained allergies, try eating organic since many people are suffering from the effects of unknowingly eating GMO foods.

Terminator technology is currently the greatest threat to humanity. If it is used by Monsanto on a large-scale basis, it will inevitably lead to famine and starvation on a worldwide basis (This means YOU, ME AND THE KIDS OF THE RICH AND THE POOR). Billions of people on the planet are supported by farmers who save seeds from the crops and replant these seeds the following year. Seeds are planted. The crop is harvested. And the seeds from the harvest are replanted the following year. Most farmers cannot afford to buy new seeds every year, so collecting and replanting seeds is a crucial part of the agricultural cycle. This is the way food has been grown successfully for thousands of years.  What is most frightening is that the traits from genetically-engineered crops can get passed on to other crops. Once the terminator seeds are released into a region, the trait of seed sterility could be passed to other non-genetically-engineered crops making most or all of the seeds in the region sterile. If that is not bad enough consider this. Phytochemicals (free-radical and anti-oxidants) are substances that plants naturally produce to protect themselves against viruses, bacteria, and fungi and to are essential for the next generation of seeds. The plant creates phytochemicals as it comes to its peak ripeness on the vine. The foods we eat today are already lacking in these  essential elements due to the fact that the majority of our foods are picked before peak ripeness for transportations means. The reason it is recommended that we eat several servings of fruits and vegetables a day is because of the health providing benefits of these phytochemicals. If the terminator seed prevents the plant from germinating the vegetable or fruit itself will not contain any of these essential nutrients and our bodies and immune systems will be left open for attack from all viruses and bacteria. We will be defensless as plants are our only way of getting these essential nutrients. One last little tidbit of information for you. Guess who is the coowner of the terminator seed patent? The US Government. See the movie.",1152835200,6,6762,5.029464285714286

2436601,1,B000BQ5IXM,"Before I begin, I would like to state that there may be a few mild spoilers in this review if you have not watched the movie yet.

Future of Foods is a movie that tries to portray itself as credible, but it begins by hastily deriving an argument that has no scientific backing, saying GMOs are evil.  Having assumed that GMOs are then bad,  the movie then spends the rest of its time using these ""bad"" GMOs as a scapegoat for economic struggles in other countries.

True enough, the movie does portray genetic recombination (with scary music playing in the background I might add), but it is this technology by which our lives have already been revolutionized today.  Microorganisms that have been genetically modified now produce pure insulin, to be injected into the bloodstream of diabetics - whereas before it had to be purified from bled animals.  Thousands of children died because of allergic reactions to the animal-derived insulin.

Not only is this movie not very scientific, but it is inaccurate as well.  For example: the farmer in Canada who was found by the courts to have illegally planted Monsanto round-up resistant canola on his fields, had claimed he had developed his own round up resistant crops.  His 'developed' crops were genetically identical to Monsanto's, and are statistically impossible to have developed without the use of advanced biotechnology labs (which he, of course, did not have).  Future of foods skipped over this point, and merely restated the age-old ""the big bad corporations are bullies"" instead of showing how it was an example of deceitful business and unintelligent farming practices on the farmer's part.

Future of foods is a decent documentary, but like most documentaries, it is incredibly one sided - and unfortunately in this case, untruthful.  Fear of new technologies arises all the time (the organic sub-culture in this case), and I ask that if you watch this movie, you critically examine what you are being presented before accepting it at face value.",1149811200,33,2008,4.996996996996997
