2362953,5,B000A5044C,"Place this one on the shelf of films that take children seriously and, at the same time, are themselves serious works of art. ""Ponette,"" ""My Father's Glory,"" Malle's ""Au Revoir les Enfants,"" Truffault's ""Small Change"" and ""The 400 Blows,"" Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander,"" DeSica's ""Shoe Shine"" and ""The Bicycle Thief,"" a couple of films from Iran, the shelf is a short but elevated one. ""Nobody Knows"" is one of the great films about childhood that nobody knows. This DVD release is certain to change that.

It is not a sentimental movie. Yet it has sentiment in it and so much honesty that it hurts to watch. It is based on a true story about four children abandoned by their mother in a tiny Tokyo apartment that shocked Japan, adding to the poignancy of what Hirokazu Koreeda has directed. His camera unhurriedly records how the children survive, the toll that takes on their childhood, and the responsibilities that burden the 12-year-old son, played by Yuya Yagira, who won a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival.

You will sense the disinterested solicitude of the mother. In contrast, the two fathers of his siblings and other adults the boy meets in seeking money and food are kind and helpful. A team coach at the school the kids long to attend invites the boy to play baseball, and he comes alive. Koreeda provides a patina of hope that slowly fades as the family unravels and one of the children dies. How the boy and a friend transport and bury the body will make your heart flinch. Don't miss this little gem.",1126915200,5,1530,4.684014869888476
2362954,5,B000A5044C,"The most heart wrenching Japanese movie I have seen to date is Isao Takahata's anime ""Hotaru no haka"" (""Grave of the Fireflies"").  Once a year I steel myself to watch it again, even though doing so is as painful as the first time.  ""Dare mo shiranai"" (""Nobody Knows"") is almost as painful and the two narratives have much in common.  Director Hirokazu Koreeda's film tells the story of 12-year-old Akira (Yya Yagira) and his three younger siblings, Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura), Shigeru (Hiei Kimura), and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu) after their mother (You), abandons them in a tiny Tokyo apartment.

When we first meet this family the mother and the two oldest children are moving into the apartment, carrying heavy suitcases.  Inside are the two younger children and this comic beginning to the film only sets up the tragedy to come.  The mother smiles too much and we quickly pick up that she is not to be trusted.  Akira has already learned this hard lesson, along with the guiding rule of their lives: do not let anybody know about the two younger children.  When the mother disappears, this rule and Akira's fear that the authorities will break up their unhappy family, keeps him from seeking help when the money runs out, the power is shut off in the apartment, and the children are starting to starve.  But there is always food being thrown out at a local sushi restaurant and ways of getting desperately needed medicine.

This story of ""Dare mo shiranai"" is based on a true story, but as far as I know that is only to the extent that there really were young kids trying to living on their own after they were abandoned by their mother.  I do not think Koreeda is following the particulars of that case.  But knowing that is important because we have to accept that these children have become invisible to the adult world, which is exactly what the title assures us.  So nobody notice, even though we have reason to believe the rent has not been paid on the apartment and the stench must be getting noticeable to others in the building.  That is why the true horror of this film is that their situation continues unabated and that beyond the pivotal tragedy in the final act the final shot of the film is really the most horrific moment of all.

This 2005 film runs 141 minutes but there is a rationale to what might be considered an excessive length because it gives a palatable weight to the long time these kids are left on their own.  Yagira won the award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, and his performance hinges on the look on his face and in his eyes as we fill in the silence with what we think must be going through his mind.  Consequently, a lot of the credit must go to Koreeda, who constructs such meaning for us in our own minds from what we seen on the screen.  There are some points in which Koreeda overplays his hand.  One is the character of young Saki (Hanae Kan), who takes an interest in Akira and whose solution to the plight of the children is different (I feel that I do not know enough about what poverty is like in Tokyo today to understand the point of this plot development).  The other is that when Akira finds an hour or two to live the life of a normal boy his age that fate finds a way to punish his brief moments of happiness.  Koreeda's strength is in his depiction of the quiet moments of desperation for these children as he shows a world where being allowed to wear a pair of squeaky shoes is a great gift and running out of coins while being on hold is a living nightmare.",1126828800,,3517,4.447040498442368
2362955,5,B000A5044C,"'Dare mo shiranai' (NOBODY KNOWS) is a gleaming little film by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda that offers a version of a true story so simply and eloquently that by the end of the film the audience is powerfully moved - without gimmicks, without imitation emotional devices, without major stars. It just simply works.  Though the film is long at 2 1/2 hours the journey is well worth it and indeed the prolonged length seems necessary to convey the plight of these touching children's plight.

The film opens (during the titles) on public transportation where a youthful mother Keiko (the pop star You) and her young son Akira (Yya Yagira) sit guarding an ugly pink suitcase and other bags. Keira and Keiko have rented a poor little apartment promising the landlord that Keiko will make no noise. Once inside their new home the ugly bags are open and two additional children emerge and a trip to the bus station adds yet a third child!  Thus, 'unknown' to the landlord, the apartment contains a family of five!  Soon Keiko leaves on a trip to 'make money', leaving some cash with Akira who is placed in charge of his brother and sisters.  Of course, Keiko doesn't return except for one brief visit months later, and leaving the children to fend for themselves.

Akira manages to make friends outside, gaining food and money for good deeds and good will, keeping his little 'family' afloat.  Gradually Akira realizes that Keiko will never return and through his friendship with a young girl still manages to eek out an existence: the manner in which he keeps his family happy is food for the soul!  But despite his constant good intentions to maintain a life for his family, one of his sisters dies and he and his girl friend bury her where she can 'watch the airplanes'.  And life goes on. There is no ending depicted, just continuum.

With the subtlest technique Koreeda creates a story so real  that it pulsates.  The child actors (especially Yya Yagira) are  so natural and fine that they grab our hearts tenaciously. The only music in this film is a few notes form a toy piano and quiet harp music that enhances the feeling of isolation of the children.  This is a film of rare beauty, one that could have been edited a bit, but even that criticism is overshadowed by the impact of  Hirokazu Koreeda's overall achievement.  Very Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, September 05",1126828800,3,2380,4.737864077669903
2362956,4,B000A5044C,"It is difficult to watch this film knowing that some children in this world will have to endure neglect of this capacity (or any other for that matter).

Roughly, the story centers on a quartet of siblings who are more or less stranded in a city apartment. At first the struggle can be humorous, however those moments become few and far between as the kids drain through the cash they have and must resort to scraping by any means necessary, barely making the ""rent"". Throughout the film the family ""hides"" themselves from the public view and tries to bond with  the few outside people they come across, which are other children of similar age.

The one reason that makes this film so great is it truly balances the good and bad events that make the experience all the more real. It never sugar coats the terrible portions, but despite how low times go for the children it depicts their spirit of survival. It is brilliant to witness how minimal/basic they have paired their lives down while existing in the gluttony of civilization.  The Boy playing the eldest child (Akira) does a marvelous performance (which he won an award for) trying to keep the clan together and not fall into despair himself. The remaining cast are very good as well, turning out a believable story.

If you come across it, definitely see the it. However uncomfortable it may prove, you'll be glad you did.",1123372800,5,1381,4.666666666666667
2362957,5,B000A5044C,"Four stepsiblings (two boys and two girls) living in present day Tokyo, Japan are suddenly abandoned by their charismatic, yet irresponsibly idealistic mother.  Left with only a little money and a vague hope that their mother may return from her romantic escapades (hoping to find a father for her kids), the children struggle to survive on their own.

  As unbelievable as the plot sounds, this film succeeds because it is surprisingly believable. The simple piano score, the raw, ""documentary-style"" of the film, and the slow, but precise pacing all compliment the memorable, realistic acting, especially from Yagira, playing the oldest boy.

  Yagira's performance is touching and heartfelt without being ""cute"" (steven speilberg would be apalled). When the food and water run out, he does not waste time crying or throwing a tantrum. Instead, he tediously pumps water from the local playground pump and shamelessly bums leftover sushi from a restaurant for him and the others, all the while smiling from time to time, dreaming of baseball and school (which he has never attended).

  Though they live day to day, looking more grungy and detatched from society,ironically, out of their harsh living, they acquire a compassion and vitality for life much stronger than that of most of their peers in the civilized world. Their newfound strength ultimately helps them to cope with an almost unthinkable tragedy that evokes scenes so powerfully simple that they are likely to remain in the viewer's mind long after the movie is over.",1121731200,9,1532,5.165991902834008
2362958,5,B000A5044C,"""Nobody Knows,"" a profoundly moving film from the acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda, proves that the greatest movies don't need flashy action or CGI effects to achieve significant emotional impact. Despite its immediate appearance of stripped-down starkness, it is a film of technical virtuosity and carefully orchestrated sequences. But the true heart of the film -- which is loosely based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in Japan in 1988 and discovered six months later -- lies in its shocking realism.

""Nobody Knows"" begins when Keiko (played by the Japanese pop star You) deserts her young children in a run-down apartment in a nameless Japanese city with barely enough money to pay the bills. Her oldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) must fend for himself and protect his younger brother Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) and his sisters Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu). Akira tries his best to be a parent, borrowing money from dishonest family acquaintances, buying Christmas gifts for his siblings and relying on new friends for help, including the young Saki (Hanae Kan).

Many films have captured the gritty experience of urban survival in a busy and unfriendly city, and plenty are told from the perspective of children. But unlike movies such as the recent ""In America,"" this story is characterized by an utter lack of sentimentality and an extraordinary subtlety. The movie merely hints at the family's past before the opening of the film -- Koreeda is wisely content to develop his characters through action without succumbing to unnecessary narration or expository dialogue.

As such, the storyline of ""Nobody Knows"" is a loose framework rather than an intricate plot. With sparse dialogue and minimalist production, the film feels wholly authentic, even documentary-like (not coincidently). Koreeda actually hired unprofessional actors, working with them in free-form improvisation and filming the story chronologically. As a result, the performances are astonishingly convincing -- the actors literally age on-screen. (Yuya Yagira, a novice, won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.)

Koreeda is keenly aware of the power that a slowly unfolding story can have. The film's quietness and slow pacing make the few plot developments and revelations all the more emotional. Rather than relying on dialogue, Koreeda reveals characters' emotions and thoughts in ways that many directors never attempt, through lingering smiles and exchanged glances. The intense connection to these characters and the ultimate emotional payoff at the climax are results of these stylistic choices.

Above all, Koreeda is a brilliant visual storyteller. With his cinematographer Yamazaki Yutaka, he creates a style that perfectly complements the fly-on-the-wall nature of his movie. The camera is patiently kept in one place, and as result much of the action takes place on the edges, even outside, of the frame. Although Koreeda and Yutaka carefully plan each shot, the film's cinematography still feels experimental and beautifully authentic. Yutaka's garish lighting and the set's close quarters, emphasize the seclusion and loneliness of the children's apartment. This symbolism extends to the repeated isolation of visual patterns (Akira on staircases, for example) to demonstrate the hopelessness of the children's existence: As the children revisit old places, each time things seem worse than before.

But, as he did with 1998's ""After Life,"" Koreeda finds unexpected humor and optimism even in the darkest of situations. At one point, Yuki's hilariously squeaky shoes represent the joyous privilege of leaving the house for the first time. In another scene, hand-held camera movement and rapid editing are used to show Akira's exhilaration as he watches a train pass quickly by, dreaming that one day it will take him far away.

Too many contemporary Hollywood films are content to tell rather than show. Koreeda's authentic direction is a refreshing reminder of cinema at its quiet best. But more importantly -- and perhaps more surprisingly, given the simplicity of its style and its plot -- ""Nobody Knows"" is highly affecting and entirely engrossing. It also constitutes a major social statement: In the late 1980s, when the plight of the four abandoned children came to light, many Japanese were shocked that their society had ever allowed this to happen. But the film, with its patient camera work and natural storyline, make their dark fates seem all too familiar.

2363023,4,B000A5044C,"Kore-eda Hirokazu is one of the best Japanese directors working today. Initially a documentarist, he started off making films for TV about everyday problems in Japanese society, concerns which have carried over into his subsequent fictional feature films. Distance (2001) was his response to the 1995 sarin gas subway attack by the sinister organization Aum Shinrikyo while Still Walking (2008) and I Wish (2011) were concerned with the broken nature of family lives in modern day Japan. Last years Like Father Like Son (2013) could have been ripped straight from newspaper headlines, focusing as it does on the case of a man who was mistakenly switched with another baby by a mid-wife soon after his birth and whose future was radically altered. This actually happened in Japan in a separate unrelated case and only a couple of months ago the victim was awarded a lump sum in damages from the government as compensation. The film under review here, Nobody Knows (2004) is another news headline written large, based as it is on the real story of a family of children abandoned by their mother in Sugamo Ward, Tokyo in 1988. Kore-eda has been careful to publically distance his film from the real life case, especially as the real story is more gruesome than what he puts in front of us here. Nevertheless, he did shoot the film in real time over a complete year, renting out an apartment (in which production staff of the film actually lived) and deploying documentary-style techniques to get as close as possible to the reality of what happens to a group of children when they are abandoned for 9 months. Hand-held camerawork combines with fly-on-the-wall observation of improvised performances from his cast of young actors to paint an extremely realistic picture. Resident in Japan (actually not far from Tokyo) and father of two elementary school kids, I was deeply shaken by this film. If we abandoned our kids I would say that what Kore-eda depicts would definitely happen. As such, I found it all just a little bit too close to home for comfort.

The film opens with a mother Fukushima Keiko (You) and her 12 year old son Akira (Yagiri Yya) moving into their new Tokyo apartment. Out of two heavy suitcases roll two more kids, the youngest son Shigeru (Kimura Hiei) and youngest daughter Yuki (Shimizu Momoko). A little later the oldest daughter Kyoko (Kitaura Ayu) arrives having been picked up at the nearest rail station by Akira. It transpires that the kids all have different fathers and that their births have not been registered with the authorities. To protect themselves from prying neighbors only Akira is allowed out of the apartment, the other three having to stay quiet and hide. The mother knows that if the authorities find out about them, the kids will be split up possibly forever. Initially she seems well intentioned, but she is young and flighty. She gets a job as a bar hostess and leaves her kids for increasingly long periods of time. One day she says goodbye and gives Akira 50,000 yen (about 250 pounds), saying she will be back for Christmas. She never returns. Eventually Akira traces her to working for a company under a new family name. He realizes she has re-married and has abandoned them. Most of the film is devoted to charting how the kids respond to their plight. At first Akira tries heroically to be the father, shopping, cooking, cleaning, instigating rules and delegating responsibilities. But as the money runs out, the food disappears and the utilities get cut off, the children revert inwards to find their baser animal instincts. I won't describe what happens thereafter as it would spoil it for you, but rest assured what happens is heart-breaking to the extreme.

If you have read this far, you might think Nobody Knows is an extremely depressing film. Fear not, for this film is no Lord of the Flies. By focusing on the positive qualities of the kids and their untapped potential for enjoying life and seizing the day with their unquenchable optimism, Kore-eda carves out a hugely positive celebration of the minutiae of everyday life which you and I take for granted. Never has an ice cream tasted so good and never has a simple trip to the local park been so liberating. At the same time the director focuses on what the kids need but cannot have to moving effect. Akira wants to go to school and craves friendship with his peers, and in the course of the film he achieves both albeit only in part. Then there is Kyoko who (because her father is a musician) wants to own and play her own piano, but has to make do with a plastic toy. As a father who sometimes has to force his kids to practice before their (very expensive!) piano lessons, my first reaction was to think about showing them this film to make them appreciate more the opportunities they have. Make no mistake this is one of those films which makes you feel lucky to be alive and lucky to be surrounded by your loved ones. In Hollywood hands it would be mired in mushy sentimentality, but Kore-edas stoicism and refusal to pander to the feel-good brigade pays off in spades. His approach is simple, subtle and profoundly revealing of the emotions that lay within the hearts of his young cast.

The films greatest achievement rests on the effortlessly superb acting of the kids. Kore-eda has a way with youngsters and here he teases out astonishing performances, especially Yagiri Yya who deservedly took home the best actor prize from Cannes that year. It is perhaps mistaken to talk about performances here as when we look at these kids we just believe they are who they are  there are no performances involved. They simply inhabit their roles with astonishing reality. Combined with Kore-edas documentary approach this makes for a film of extraordinarily tangible emotional power.

I was tempted to give 5 stars, but I have two slight criticisms. In the first place, at 140 minutes the film is a long haul which seems even longer because of the slow pace of the narrative. I have no problem with slow narratives, but as vital as the performances are and as sensitive as Kore-edas treatment is, there is simply not enough here to sustain the running time. Scenes become repetitive and one suspects a good 20 minutes could easily have been shorn without harming the films narrative structure. Secondly, I have a problem with the films ending. I cant be specific here without giving the game away, but the whiff of artificial melodrama doesnt sit with the natural treatment of everything that precedes it. Im probably being a little harsh here, because on balance this is still a superior film that warrants close attention.

I have no gripes with the quality of this ICA Projects DVD. It is a bare-bones product with no extras at all, not even the booklet that some reviews posted here have suggested comes with it. However, the picture and sound are both top quality with English subtitles properly letter-boxed and highly legible. I notice that this film is also being offered in a cheap box set together with Still Walking, After Life (1998) and Air Doll (2009). That would be the best way to buy it as the other 3 films are all excellent. For those unsure about Kore-eda this cheap single disc release remains a highly recommendable taster.",1411430400,,7263,4.783266932270917

2363055,3,B000A5044C,"Despite the astonishing realism that Hirokazu manages to capture in this 140 minute documentary-esqu film about how four siblings would cope without their parents, he somehow neglects to create any emotional bond between the characters and the viewer.
Neglecting to filter out unnecessary sequences between, what should be, heart-wrenching moments and yet still managing to spread the story over a full year was a bold move which doesn't seem to have paid off as well as it should have. Boldly introducing characters for 2 minute scenes, only to never be seen again; unlikely interactions with neighbours and the odd rain-man-type reaction from characters are just a few gripes I had with this film.
These things aside, the slow but obvious disorder that appears as the film progresses is where all the emotion seems to lie. The gravel-like crayon stubs which were full Crayola just 2 scenes earlier, the noticeable growth in hair and the lack of food which further-diminishes every time the fridge is opened; just a few of the many minor details which hold this film together.
Stunningly filmed over several seasons and constructed in a manner which doesn't make it immediately obvious which season you're watching, this film definitely has the beauty that it deserves, but maybe this subject matter needs more than beauty to hold together the story of a mismatched group of kids fighting for survival, It needs love... or a lack there of.",1357084800,,1440,5.054621848739496
2363056,4,B000A5044C,"""Nobody Knows"" is a 2004 Japanese film directed by Hirokazu Koreeda.  Based loosely on an abandonment tragedy that occurred in the late 80s, it follows the lives of four children left to fend for themselves in a small Tokyo apartment.

And it IS loosely based.  I've read some unfavorable reviews from people upset that the film didn't stay true to the original incident, but perhaps they expect too much.  ""Based on a true story"" has become one of the more annoying tags in cinematic advertising and lending it your faith while choosing a film is a mistake.  Had the real story never happened, this would simply be an unsettling, successful drama.  Judging it harshly because it doesn't mirror the original events isn't so much a review of the movie as it is a stab at cozen marketing.  This, to me, is a disservice.

""Nobody Knows"" is a delicate, wonderfully acted film, and certainly worth what's being asked here.  The cinematography is minimalistic, highly effective, and the synergy between these child actors is remarkable.  I've read online that the director put massive efforts towards creating a realistic environment for these kids and it shows - the interactions felt very real.

I think the only caution I'd air is that the stills used to advertise this film represent something a bit more pleasant than what's actually being delivered.  Not to say that this wasn't a rewarding viewing experience, but if you're looking for a feel-good film, you'll probably do well to move along.  While it's not as gruesome as the real incident, it definitely houses some sad days.

I'd also advise that it's a long film - some 145 minutes.  My wife and I broke it in half over two nights and it worked out well.  That's still a bit long for my taste but we're glad we picked it up and we'll be watching it again.

Thank you for your time.

The young lead in the film, named Akira, a 12 yo boy [current age 22 at the time of this review] and played by Yuya Yojira won the best actor award at the 2004 Cannes film festival for his performance in this film as he should have. But all of his supporting cast were equally good.  The story concerns the abandonment of 4 children Akira, age 12, his sister Kyoko [played by Ayu Kitaura] about 11, Yuki [played by Momoko Shimizu], his five yo sister, and Shigeru played by Hiei Kimura] about Yuki's age in the film.  Their young mother Keiko Fukishima, played by the well known actress YOU, is a typical irresponsible parent, who has four kids by several men, but is looking to find love and happiness elsewhere without the obligations of taking care of her young family.  Through various periods of abandonment by the mother which becomes final abandonment, although she sends money earned from her various dalliances occasionally, it is never enough.  Therefore, the care of his family is placed upon the young Akira, who is a mere 12yo child himself and he along with his siblings are forced to refrain from formal schooling so no one will discover their true plight.  He finds young love with a cute school girl Saki [touchingly played by Hanae Kan], about his age, yet his youth is stymied by being thrust into an adult role way before he should take on such burdens for himself let alone three younger siblings.  Because no one is to find out about the mother's absence she sneaks them into a new apartment, the two youngest in suitcases, and says that only Akira is to show himself, of child welfare might come and take them away. He gets involved with the typical street kids and throughout one has a foreboding of tragedy about to strike.

The story is touching, but depressing, and yet you can't divert your eyes from the drama unfolding before them. This is one film in which the suspension of disbelief is total due to all facets of its production. I have never so effusively praised a film before and watch at least 300 different films a year, but in this case everything about the film from the wonderful cinematography with great lighting, the acting by all, and the superb direction and script by Hirokazu Kore-eda deserve equal praise.  My only regret is that I didn't see this film when it first came out.

Maybe it's because children and child welfare are important to me as a former foster parent and adoptive parent or maybe it's because it was extremely well done.  The actors in this film were very good considering their young ages and it showed me a side of ""neat, orderly and proper"" Japan that I secretly had to know existed but had never actually seen.  I know this film was based on actual events but wasn't meant to be a documentary so I give it 5 stars because it was well written, well acted, well filmed and one of those films that will stick with me when someone asks ""seen any good films lately?"".  The mother in this film I've seen in another Japanese drama and that is just her normal talking voice, so don't think it's put-on just for this movie.  She starts off seeming to be a loving and playful mother, even though the movie starts out with her moving into an apartment building with her ""only child"" a quiet & mature 12 year old boy and then quickly find out as she unpacks her several large pieces of luggage that she has four children!  When I watched the movie, my heart ached for them, I could see it from a child's point of view and it made me get a nervous feeling in my stomach trying to imagine doing what this mother did.

Most of what we see are indies and foreign films and the packaging on this made it look ideal for my work.

However compelling the ""true"" story, this film felt like torture.  Do not expect anything but the sensation of sitting on an ant mound as you await for some pacing to evolve or hair to grow.  If you let your own imagination draft the script, it will surpass this agony.  Draggy and inept, this film forced us to succumb to the fast-forward button for the final hour.

I won't go into a ton of detail on the storyline because lots of reviewers have done that. But there is a lot to say about Nobody Knows, and I'll limit my comments to a few.

First of all, if you like happy movies and can't stand depressing, sobering ones, this is NOT for you. Trust me.

Second, it was so well done. The kids in it really shined, they were such good actors, it was like watching a documentary. It was believable, raw and it really pulled out emotions, whether it was a scene about simple pleasures in life (and I mean simple), worrying about finances as a child, wondering what your mother is up to and hoping she's coming back..and on and on.

Lastly, I have since gone back and am going to watch other movies similar to this one. While I was ridiculously bummed at the end (hoping I'm a good mom, putting my kids first all of my life, having survived a rough childhood) I have come full-circle and realized that this is a really, really good movie. It's worth your time. Yes, it's foreign but don't let that stop you.

2363085,5,B000A5044C,"Set in modern day Tokyo, the movie follows the life of four brothers and sisters in a dismembered family. The father left a long time ago, the mother is an immature woman who is looking for self-fulfillment, no matter what the (family) cost. Without ever knowing what she really does for a living, the audience is led to face and (hopefully) bear her repetitive, largely unjustified and lengthy leaves from home, leaving her kids behind under the supervision of her oldest, teenage son. One day however, she fails to return and the kids are left alone with a handful of bank notes... and nobody to rely on.

The movie follows a linear, chronological timeline, the shooting is clean and efficient, actors are top notch: the lead character, Yagira Yuuya, was actually crowned Best Male Actor at the 2004 Cannes ! Youngest ever!

A special attention was brought by the director to accurately depicting feelings rather than thoughts in a brilliant attempt to stick to how kids actually live. As a result, the movie is more factual than anything else. Therefore, expect no judgment whatsoever on the mother: it's up to the audience to decide whether to hate or forgive her.

Although it quickly becomes clear that a drama is unfolding, the audience is left in awe by the kids' resilience and extraordinary will to survive, building optimism. They simply never, ever give up! Makes grown-ups wonder: would I be able to do the same in their situation? There is nothing to throw away in this movie. Truly a most recommended piece of 7th art production.

She comes to a new town with the oldest to a apartment with the two other ones in suitcases. They start living in this apartment with rules no loud noises, no school for the oldest two.

2363120,4,B000A5044C,"The film is based on a true story in Japan, 1988 where a heartless mother abandoned her children in an apartment.  In most cases where film depicts true life, the film story is more sensualized.  But here, according to reports of the true incident, the real life ""Affair of the Abandoned Children of Sugamo."" is much more grim.

Nobody Knows, filmed in 2004, takes place in Japan where a young mother of four tells the children she is out of town working and leaves the children to fend for themselves, for months or forever.  Initially, mother and eldest son rent an apartment, but she sneaks the other children into the apartment. The other three are never to go outside, nor attend school.  She tramps around, then leaves.

From a Boy to a Man to a Boy to a Man
The pre-teen boy is suddenly thrust into manhood, as we see him dutifully budget the money left to him, paying rent, buying food.  He is the man of the house, until temptations of childhood take over and as a young boy indulges on games and nonsense with friends.  Then, as the money and friends go, he tries to earn money to support his siblings, the role of a man.

Although the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, the pace slow; it is necessary to depict the length of time these children are alone, fending for themselves.  Some feel it could have been cut considerably.  Dialogue is minimal and soundtrack low key.  It won several awards.

What is depicted in the film does not ring true to ""survival."" We get the feeling that their life is not in too much despair.  The children do not appear ""neglected"" and it doesn't quite come across as months of solitude without proper supervision and care.

2363121,5,B000A5044C,"Nobody Knows (Dare mo shiranai) is based on a true story of children left on their own for months on end to fend for themselves in a Tokyo apartment. Cautioned to remain hidden, as the landlord only knew about one child instead of four, the three younger ones constantly stay inside, away from any contact with the rest of the world.

I was struck by several things about this film. First, what may be a cultural difference between Japan and America - the gentleness and slowness of their lives' rhythms, down to the way the children put books into the shelf or take dishes out of the cupboard. I found this pace, combined with the sweetness to their communal laying around instead of isolation in individual bedrooms with technology to occupy their minds, beautiful and inspiring - even if it is intended to show the ennui that eventually comes with being continually trapped indoors.

This brings me to the second point. I am surprised that Koreeda didn't show the kids showing any ill effects from being cooped up like that. They had no way to use their bodies in real physical activity, and no connection with nature, dirt, weather, or other animals. This would surely drive a person mad - yet these children remain sweet to each other and even creative.

The children seek nature and their own wild selves anyway, drawing pictures on whatever paper is available (such as an overdue water bill) and posting them all over the walls; and their one illicit outing led to their collecting precious seeds of ""weeds"", which they then carefully planted in leftover ramen containers to bloom an unkempt wildflower garden on their balcony. The film shows the poignant human yearning toward Beauty, no matter how dire the circumstances.

The oldest girl cannot accept that her mother has abandoned them, and scenes like her wistfully fingering a stain on the floor left by a spilled bit of nailpolish from their last time together just breaks your heart.

The oldest boy who's left in charge, played by the very deep Yuya Yagira, is much more pragmatic about facing the truth about their situation. He also exhibits a lot more maturity than the mother, taking on responsibility for his siblings and letting go of all his studies except math, in order to calculate their dwindling ability to deal with the household expenses. Although clearly out of his league in terms of the responsibility loaded onto him, he does what he can to keep them all fed, bathed, and happy; and to get money to achieve this, from seeking out several of their missing fathers to trying to get a job even though he's underage. Yet he refuses to sink low even in dire straits - (mild spoiler coming) - he won't steal food even to keep his new pals, and he won't accept money from another friend gained through means he disapproves of. His nobility of spirit is one of the shining forces that makes this film so compelling.

The kids rarely show any sort of emotion, another trait of this movie that I found odd, and wonder if it may be cultural. Even when confronted with death, there are no tears. This stoicism, exhibited even in the youngest, makes the few moments when subtle anger or despair do show all the more powerful. When a crisis strikes and the oldest boy tries desperately to contact his mother at a number where she's obviously gone off to form a new family, he gets told to wait so long that his payphone coins run out. He slowly puts the receiver down and collapses his forehead against the phone. This simple action conveys more bleak, aware despair than any wailing would.

The ending was initially unsatisfying to me because there really isn't one. You know darned well that these kids can't go on this way for very long, that something will have to give - the landlady will come back again for the unpayable rent and kick them out; they will be discovered; something. But on second thought, I realize that maybe this unsettling aspect is part of the film's genius. People live like this in cities all over the world, and this sort of situation does go on and on and on with no resolution.

If you want to know more about 'the real story' this film was based on, I found Wikipedia to provide the clearest and most concise source. ([...]  Reading it, one can see how the director deliberately changed the story to avoid an easy `good vs. evil' theme. He also chose to alter the storyline to eliminate the sort of blood-n-guts scenes so ubiquitous to American films.

2363124,5,B000A5044C,"It is no surprise that the greatest contemporary movies no longer originate from the U.S.  Perhaps it's because most American filmmakers play it safe using recycled characters and plots because they are trying to please the studios. It's about big business which is why so many films seem like they were made on an assembly line. They're cost-efficient (supposedly), predictable, and indistinguishable from each other.

That's why a quiet little masterpiece like director Kore-Eda Hirokazu's ""Nobody Knows"" could never be made in the United States.  It would be too ""risky"" of an investment since there are no big stars.  And the movie is preoccupied with the mundane tasks of everyday survival. There is no miraculous happy ending, nor are there any scenes loaded with special effects.

That is the reason that this movie is so powerful, even devastating. It is about the realities that everyone of us face- the daily struggle to provide adequate food and shelter for our families, to pay the bills, and to protect our loved ones from harm.  In ""Nobody Knows"" these basic necessities become ever out of reach because they must be fulfilled by four young children with little or no help from adults.

The movie takes its time in documenting the almost unimaginable challenges that these innocent kids face because their parents have abandoned them.  The adults that they do interact with are limited in the amount of help that they can offer. The movie is also a profound indictment of a rigidly structured and intolerant Japanese society where illegitimacy is treated as something so shameful that no one is supposed to know that illegitamite children even exist.

Director Hirokazu never preaches nor overdramatizes the children's plight.  The children just do what they must do in order to survive.  The film is replete with remarkable naturalist acting especially from the film's youngest performers. They seem real enough to be your next-door neighbors.  And even in desperation, these brave children somehow manage to find simple joy and beauty in their harsh environment which makes their misfortunes almost unbearable to witness.

""Nobody Knows"" is a masterpiece.  It is a deliberately paced, contemplative study of the struggle to live when tragedy and hardship strike.  And it's a movie that you will not soon forget.",1221004800,4,2327,5.135278514588859

The storyline is simple but captivating in its own way. The story follows 12 year old Akira and his enigmatic, alcoholic, and immature mother whose only real focus is on her new boyfriends and not her kids. After moving to their new home, Akira's mother comes home less and less and eventually leaves a note that she's not coming back forever.

Akira lies to his younger siblings to keep their spirits up, but he has to deal with the truth that he is on his own to take care of his family.

At first he is able to live off the little money his mother sends him, but eventually he becomes broke. He gives his siblings what freedoms he can while keeping them hidden from the landlord or risk being thrown out the the apartment. When they're seen Akira must lie again and tell the landlord that they are his ""cousins.""

After weeks of the strain on money the AC is shut off, the water is shut off, and the electricity too. Akira struggles to find what money he can. He finds some help in a girl named Saki. She tries to offer Akira money but her refuses.

Eventually the strain kicks completely and the strain causes tense rifts in the family that can only be tied together by simple joys of joking around and spending time in the park.

This story is straightforward but speaks in a way that shows the real stages of growing up as well as understanding the world of adults even at a young age.

The heartwarming younger siblings who have to smile and keep Akira going forward make the film what it is. They give a positive unbroken aura of innocence even when Akira must give up his for reality.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or likes realistic films that express important aspects of life as people grow up and move onwards.

In fact, the mother has to smuggle three of them into their rented flat in suitcases so the landlord does not know they exist. The film tells the story of how the children survive.

The problem I have with this film is that while the original premise of the plot is original and potentially interesting, the story becomes more and more unbelievable (I don't want to give too much of the plot away). Where are social services, the police, the landlord etc (the children are eventually unable to pay bills and have water, gas and electricity cut off). In fact where was the plot. Character development is poor. The mother's character is not developed (and she is surely the pivotal character).

I'd make sure to go to real speed when it was obvious there was dialogue. I don't think I missed much as much of the movie is just microscopic observing day to day to day. It's like something you want to put in the oven to make it shrink whole. Terrific acting, a compelling story, very well made with nice cinematography, but what can I say, it was unbearably long, even in fast forward. Hey, I've got a life to live. I don't need to sit and have the poignant stretched out to almost 2 1/2 hours unnecessarily. I got it. The movie is long because it forces you to empathize with how their life is a long unbearable waiting. I got that at 4x speed, thank you. There's a great many long movies, longer than this one, which I love and don't feel the length unnecessary at all. I suppose every scene here is ""telling,"" but please, respect your audience. Give your audience more credit for picking up the nuances without having to make them stare at each one ten minutes at a time. Every little moment is not all that profound just because it is filmed well. The best way to say it is, it was overindulgent in the situation. The cutting room floor does have it valid purposes.

I can only give this movie three stars simply because of the unbearable pace. Otherwise, everything else about it might have made it to 5, at least 4 stars. The boy did deserve his best actor award. I'll get a lot of negative ratings for this review. You always get many negative ratings of your review when you have something not particularly nice to say about a well made movie which a lot of people say they love. I suppose a lot of people think this movie is perfect. Is that true, or are you not being perfectly honest? The length experience is probably very subjective. I can say I watched a very good memorable film with lots of good memorable images and scenes, but it was so so very unnecessarily long in the watching. It's a bit of a paradox for me that way, but you have to be truthful in your reviews. It's a recommendable film, but with a huge warning--it's only for the most patient among us. Guess I didn't qualify.

After you watch the film, do an online search for ""Affair of the four abandoned children of Sugamo"" which will turn up accounts of the real story the movie is ""based on."" The real story is a much grimmer reality than what this film depicts. That fact is quite revealing about the movie maker and his intentions. The disparity between the real story and the movie's story raises the question of when you can actually claim, ""based on a true story."" It'd be better to say something like, the idea was inspired by a true story, but apart from that, it's actually an entirely fictional creation with no intention of actually depicting the true story. The movie maker's made up world is a fundamentally different world created for his own purposes. Don't watch this film believing that it's documenting a true story. It's not. You can probably say that about maybe 95%--or probably more--of movies ""based on a true story."" History and entertainment are two practices that should, necessarily, always be in complete conflict with each other.

It is very much like another very sad movie that I have watched, Grave of the Fireflies. They are both about children living in dire poverty without the aid of adults, both Japanese, both sad, and both based upon true stories, and neither has a happy ending. Even though this movie is painful to watch, I still reccomend it, as it is very well made and has a powerful (and I think important) message.

Keiko is a single mother living with her four children (all from different fathers) in a cramped apartment she's recently rented in a middle class section of Tokyo.  Fearful that they will be thrown out onto the streets if the neighbors or landlord discover the existence of the kids, she makes the three youngest ones stay indoors and out of sight while the oldest, 12-year-old Akira, is allowed to venture out to run errands and enjoy at least some semblance of a normal life.  None of the children attend school.  Despite his youth, Akira, in many ways, has been forced to assume the role of parent, providing for the other children while Keiko stays away for months at a time, ostensibly earning money working (though we are inclined to speculate that there may be a far more nefarious truth behind the absences that is never fully revealed to us).

Based on a true story, ""Nobody Knows"" is more of an observational study on human behavior than a full-fledged narrative; it is a film that uses the minutiae of everyday life, rather than heavy-handed plot points, to generate its drama.  As virtual prisoners in their own apartment, the children survive as best they can without adult supervision or guidance.  Indeed, in its own quiet way, the film serves as an allegory of a much larger issue, a stinging indictment against a society that too often abandons and neglects its children to pursue its own selfish interests - most often to devastating and disastrous results both for the youngsters themselves and for the society as a whole.

Beautifully written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, this is a heartrending film filled with moments of quiet perceptions and unforgettable images.  The actors portraying the children are all truly amazing - wholly natural, unaffected and believable in front of the camera.  Yuya Yagira, as young Akira, is basically called on here to carry the film and he does so in a way that leaves one awestruck and breathless.  His is an exquisitely internalized performance, serious and stoic on the outside, yet with a sly mischievousness that peeks through from time to time to remind us that Akira is really just a kid at heart, forced to grow up much too fast and assume the mantle of adult responsibility that the actual ""adults"" around him have been all too eager to abandon.  What's so heartbreaking about this film is watching these sweet (but never cloying) children being deprived of all the true essentials of a happy childhood - freedom, fresh air, open space, education, even food and electricity, not to mention the all-important feeling of security and belonging that comes with the love and guidance of a fully engaged parent.  Yet, although they yearn for all these things, the children seem to accept their plight with a sort of uncomplaining fatalism combined with a love of one another and a resourcefulness and spirit of survival that is both astonishing and inspiring.

Nothing about ""Nobody Knows"" is ever obvious or underlined, not its message and certainly not its emotions.  These seep into the film gradually and unobtrusively so as not to disturb the near-documentary nature of the movie.  We feel almost as if we are eavesdropping on the children, as if we were the very neighbors from whom they are trying so desperately to hide.  There's no point in denying that the movie requires patience from the viewer, for it achieves its power subtly and slowly, through an artfully arranged accumulation of activities and details.  Yet, this is precisely what draws us into the world of the film and makes us, finally, not mere observers but rather empathetic participants with the characters.

Although he made this movie based on the actual event, he didn't made the movie exactly the same as the way it happened. Before applauding this movie without knowing the truth you should know what actually happened in 1988 in Sugamo. The fact is that those children couldn't go to a school because most of the time the mother gave birth to children at home and never registered children's births. The second son died shortly after giving birth, so the mother packed the son's body into a plastic bag with deodorant, and hide in a closet. After that she got involved with a man and left behind her own children at home. The oldest son had to take care of his siblings without enough money and before long he started having fun with two friends. One day he noticed that someone ate a cupnoodle which he bought for stockpiling. When he knew his younger sister(the third girl)who was still 2 years old had eaten it, he beat her hard. Looked at his doing to the girl infant his two friends joined the discipline. They dropped her to the floor from a high place, kicked her like a ball, and finally beat her to death. The oldest son was in the next room with the knowledge of their deed. After they went to home he knew his sister was dead, so he packed her into a plastic bag with deodrants and hid it in the closet as his mother had done before. However, there weren't enough deodrants in the plastic bag, the body started to stink so badly. He had no choice but to dispose her to somewhere. He packed the body into a traveling bag, and abandoned the body in the park where one of his friends had been before. In the movie, he packed her whom accidentally fell off a chair and died into a suitcase, and carried it with a girl who didn't like to go to school to near the place which is near to the air port. Recalled the sister loved to see an airplane he decided to go there. The mother once told them their real father was a pilot. There exits a huge gap between the real event and the movie. Of course, the mother and other people around them had responsibility for the event,and I understand Koreeda's intention that he wanted to focus on mainly children. However, there was more behind the movie. I just don't understand Koreeda said that he wanted audiences to know children grew up without anybody knowing about it. He should have been faithful to the real event because such an unbelievable event should be remembered without glorifying.",1149120000,14,2499,4.434782608695652

2363183,5,B000A5044C,"The issues this movie raises are relevant for parents and kids anywhere- my son is under 5, but I intend to watch this with him if there is not something better out by then when he is around 10 to be able to discuss all the issues this raises. I think it is good for kids to realise that this happens and once they are aware that not everyone can go to school when they want to, or not everyone has parents, I think it can bring up some healthy discussions. It is also a must see for parents, it is not overdramatised and really gives you a sense of what kids feel when they are abandoned and how we as a community can try to watch out for kids in trouble- not only our own.

This movie is so powerful and focuses on the positive things the oldest boy of 4 siblings did to keep his family going once his mother abandoned them. They were able to survive for almost 6 months without anyone seeming to notice their showers in the park and not going to school.

In the true story which you can find some information about (in Japanese) on the internet (Asahi newspaper story 1988) which paints a much darker picture of the actual events which are never represented in the movie. For example, as far as I can tell, the oldest son actually beat the youngest girl because he thought she ate the last of the food and she died from the beating- a very different story occurs in the movie. The mother also had killed one of the children in an accident involving hiding him in a suitcase (so there were originally 6 kids according to the papers).

However, the director and script writers chose only to portray the oldest son's character as a struggling, but protective one- I guess they decided it made a better movie, but the fact that he stuck around and did not abandon his brothers and sisters despite being the most capable and able to survive on his own, is truly representative of his good character which was well represented in the movie. One thing I wish they had added at the end of the film was some kind of summation of what happened to the kids like many movies based on real stories do, I think many viewers want to know if the kids are now doing okay, in foster care or whatever happened to them in the end.

2363185,5,B000A5044C,"Kore-eda's achievement in this film is startling. This is film art grounded in the minimalist traditions of the Ozu school of Japanese filmmaking; leisurely story development, very little camera movement, minimal dialogue, perfectly-pitched performances from the actors. It references much of the best of contemporary Japanese cinema; the abused outcast child seen in Village of Dreams, the rites-of-passage trials in Firefly Dreams, the pagan rituals exhibited in Swallowtail. And yet, added to these elements, is a devastating critique of the anomie afflicting contemporary Japanese society. In recent years we have heard stories of a child found dead in a box in a residential area, a young woman kidnapped and held in a house between the ages of nine and nineteen, children suffocating in a car while their parents play pachinko, and a mother and son who starved to death in the middle of Tokyo because they were too proud to ask for welfare. The film is based on one true story, but I was reminded of all of these stories while viewing. All of these incidents happened in heavily-populated areas, but nobody knew. It is quite a feat that the director manages to indict more than the damaged, neglectful mother; the disinterested neighbours (always shot in an alienating manner, lower-body only or head turned away), the landlord, the utility companies, the convenience store clerks who fail to act.

Japan has released its own version of this story and it's called Nobody Knows. But this one ain't a comedy. Rather than a sugary sweet tale with a swell ending, we get a more realistic and much sadder tale of an immature and frighteningly dependent woman saddled with kids who faces a bleak future until she does the unthinkable. Despite the despicable behavior of the mom, however, Nobody Knows avoids easy answers. It brings you into the lives of this unlucky family so that you feel as though you are actually living with them and getting to know each one. The pace is deliberately slow to achieve real time immersion. If you can take it, the emotional impact is profound.",1135555200,3,870,4.547770700636943
2363187,5,B000A5044C,"I hadn't heard of this movie before, and only rented it on a whim because the cover blurb interested me.  I didn't expect it to be so emotionally draining-- I watched it yesterday, but I still feel like I might cry just thinking about it!-- but this is definitely one I'll watch again, and one I would like to own.

This seems at first the story of a loving, if selfish and immature mother. . . sure, she raises her family in an unconventional way, but they seem to be a close-knit, generally happy bunch.  They even seem fine at first when she leaves them alone with nothing but a note and an envelope of money, but the money starts to run out, and Akira is forced to borrow from his siblings' fathers to keep afloat.  When their mother does return, there seems to be a hint of resentment, especially from the older children.

Then we find out just how selfish she can be, as their mother leaves her job and children outright to be with a man.  She doesn't even tell them what she's doing-- Akira finds out by calling around to check up on her.  I don't think he actually tells his siblings where she's run off to, but Kyoko, at least, seems to know they've been abandoned from fairly early on.  She tries to shelter the others with promises their mother will return, but even they become more doubtful as time goes by.

Akira does an admirable job of holding the household together at first, but goes through his own selfish period when he befriends some schoolboys, and spends more time playing games with them than caring for the home and his siblings.  By the time he learns their true nature and returns to his home life, the place is in squallor and the utilities are all being turned off.  Though their living situation gets worse all the time, surprisingly, the children remain close, and pull together to survive as best they can.

The fact these children are all amateurs makes their acting in this film all the more amazing-- they can convey more emotion in a glance than many Western actors can in a page full of dialogue.  I felt connected to these children, and concerned for their well-being, more than any other movie characters I can think of.  The adults who seemed to see the situation, yet did nothing to help, infuriated me!  Even just the passers-by who saw a group of poor, dirty children in the street yet didn't stop to help, or even question why, made me angry.  For all the concern of what might happen if anyone saw them, these children seemed pretty much invisible most of the time.

The ending is incomplete, yes.  We never know whether their mother comes back, or whether social services step in at any point.  The lack of resolution is mildly annoying, but it also leaves one with the impression that these children are still out there, still doing whatever it takes to survive and stay together.  That's the sort of movie this is; salvaging hope from even the darkest and most dire situations.",1135296000,21,2927,4.507575757575758

2363199,5,B000A5044C,"""Dare mo shiranai"" (Nobody Knows) by Kore-eda Hirokazu is all the more poignant for being based on a real-life scandal in Japan. In 1988, four children were found abandoned by their mother, living for six months in a squalid Tokyo apartment with no running water, electricity, or food, where one of the children, weakened by malnutrition, was accidentally killed.

As the film begins, the family is moving into yet another apartment; they are continuously evicted for having too many children. The two youngest children arrive smuggled in suitcases, already a sign of the startling neglect to come, as the mother portrays this as a game. The hot, tired children unfold from their suitcase prisons as the mother laughs, claps her hands and tells them ""Good job!"" in her Minnie Mouse voice. The children's flighty mother is barely more than a child herself, unable to cope with real life and care for her large brood (each child has a different father).

It is never explicitly stated what her job is, but she frequently leaves the children for long stretches of time, expecting eldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) to care for ten-year-old Kyoko, seven-year-old Shigeru, and five-year-old Yuki. The children are like children everywhere: they long to play outside, be rambunctious, play in the park, be free to dream. Instead, they are virtual prisoners, unable to leave the apartment lest they be caught. Even the small balcony is off limits. Akira does all of the outside shopping, bill paying, and cooking. None of the children go to school. ""Why do you want to go to school?"" their mother asks. ""Famous people don't go to school."" Like who? Akira demands. His mother can't come up with a suitable answer.

The inevitable happens: their mother is infatuated with the latest boyfriend, and skips town for good. Akira holds off telling the other children for as long as possible; after all, their mother is frequently gone for months at a time. He is forced to spend down, but it isn't enough. The utilities are eventually cut off, and the apartment descends into a pit of hell, with garbage covering everything. The children must use the bathroom in the park and wash their clothes in a fountain, and survive off of leftover sushi handouts. Akira falls in with a group of thug-like high schoolers who use him, taunt him, and try to get him to shoplift, and the youngest children suffer the most. Somber Kyoko taps out melodies on her toy piano, Shigeru breaks the rules by running wild outside, and Yuki colors and draws pictures that cover every inch of the apartment. Their situation becomes more and more dire; even though the landlord's wife has seen the state of the apartment, no social services are called in. The children are left to fester as their clothes unravel and they slowly succumb to malnutrition. An accident occurs, prompted out of boredom, that changes their close-knit lives. The ending is sparse, haunting, and we are not told what becomes of the children, or if their mother was ever found.

The child actors were essentially filmed living in the apartment throughout an entire year of filming, so in some ways, ""Nobody Knows"" plays out like a documentary. The scene where they play in the park for the first time was really their first time leaving the apartment in months. It is heartwrenching to watch them spying on ""normal"" children down below, children who take school for granted, are allowed to ride bikes and play in the park. There is no creative outlet, no exercise, no nourishing food, and yet, although weakened, their spirits still demonstrate the resilience of childhood. Kore-eda's haunting portrait of solitude and survival at its darkest is difficult to watch, but worth the journey.",1134000000,6,3719,4.90779014308426
2363200,5,B000A5044C,"This film is based on a true story but as Koreeda himself states at the film's outset, all the details of the film are entirely fictional as what actually happened was far bleaker than what is shown in the film. What actually happnened was that mother left one baby dead in the closet while leaving the other four on their own to take care of themselves. One of the kids that the eldest son brought into their apartment killed one of the other three infants, whose body was then abandoned in the woods. Afther the whole picutre of the incident unravelled, there followed lengthy debates in many quarters on how children born out of wedlock should be recognized and protected by society.

  Compared to the utter gruesomeness of the event, the film, tragic though it may be in its own way, offers us viewers a glimmer of hope and is emotionally far more acceptable. All those child actors play wonderfully well with all the subtlty and fineness one can ask for. Piano, baseball, airplane and plants in noodle containers all work as metaphors of freedom that the children long for. This film is truly the one for the ages, and I have no hesitation whatsoever to call this a modern-day masterpiece.",1133308800,3,1195,4.654028436018957
2363201,4,B000A5044C,"This is a great film and an extremely important one as well.  Amazingly, it is brought to life through a screenplay acted out primarily by children, with relatively little dialogue.  After about the first quarter of the film, the absence of the mother brings the dialogue to a near halt.  Occasionally it is punctuated by the babblings of the smaller children however Akira and Kyoko, the two older children, exist in relative silence.  Interactions amongst store clerks and others are limited to mechanical discourse of mere formality.  Never do we hear what Akira is feeling.  Hence, the viewer is forced to watch and attempt to understand what is going on in each child's mind.  In a sense, viewing this movie is an exercise in child psychology.

With their mother absent, their living conditions degenerate.  Although the younger children seem oblivious to their squalid living conditions, the senses of Akira and his sister Kyoko seem to further dull with each passing day.  They show relatively no emotion.  At one point Akira seeks to obtain some money from his younger sister's father.  They meet behind a pachinko hall where he works.  He gives him 5000 yen and then tells young Akira that even though he is giving him money, Yuki (Akira's sister) couldn't possibly be his daughter because he never had unprotected sex with his mother.  The discussion of one's mother's sexual promiscuity would seemingly be traumatic to a young child, but the fact that this statement doesn't seem to faze him, reveals how deep his emotions are set inside.

During the whole movie there are numerous signals that one would think neighbors would see.  The landlord's wife seems to be somewhat aware of their situation but does not investigate.  Even a convenience store clerk, who is fully abreast of their dire condition, does nothing.  The fact that in a developed nation and in an urban environment, this story could be played out leads one to question the safeguards established within our own communities and cities.

Although watching Nobody Knows is painful, a careful viewing will allow you take in all that it has to offer.  Along with its excellent visual presentation, its simple music complements the acting.  Some might feel that the movie is a little on the long side, to which I would agree.  Some scenes seemed a little tangential and non-critical to an understanding of the children, but I would not categorize them as completely superfluous.  It is definitely a film worth your time, but perhaps not the $20 for the DVD if you get easily bored.

The critical themes that emerge are unquestioning love, selflessness, selfishness, and social responsibility.  In short, a young boy is left to care for his siblings when his mother abandons them.  It is a story filled with images of daily life in modern Japan, the setting for a heart wrenching story of the hope and the promise that a child can find anywhere.

If you are not a fan of modern Japanese cinema, then this film is probably not for you.  In other words, if you are looking for something to experiment with, do not purchase this.  This is for those who like Japanese film and understand a bit about Japanese culture and enjoy the exploration of these virtures...that one does not show emotion, one does not show tears, one does not reveal to the world their inner fears, thoughts or desires.  If this is your cup of tea then it will be particularly moving to see such themes so convincingly acted by mere children.  For me, that was the essence of this film and is a very real portrayal of the skills needed to survive in Japanese culture, the pride of a young boy to care for his siblings even to the end of honoring his promises.

If you happen to have already seen this film and loved it, or would like an additional recommendation, check out ""Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World (2004)"" a film that won 6 awards (including 3 Japanese Academy Awards) and was nominated for 7 others.",1132099200,6,1822,4.487878787878788
2363203,4,B000A5044C,"By now, all readers should have a good idea of what this movie is all about, an observation of how four siblings (same mother but different fathers) carried on living when they were all but forgotten by their mother.  Whilst some viewers might think that the mother was self-centred and callous, thinking of her own pursuit of happiness, this movie pointed straight to the social issues that Japan is facing right now.  True, Japan is an industrialised nation and it has a high standard of living.  Nonetheless, it doesn't imply that the Japanese's quality of life is moving on-par with the standard.  Rather, people are slaving away and minding their own business or that people are verging towards extremism.  It's ultimately survival of the fittest and everyone is there fending for themselves.  Viewers shall see for themselves the superficial politeness that Japanese is known for in this movie.  One would think that the neighbours of those siblings would have noticed of their unkempt appearances and them hanging around when they should be attending schools but they were pretty much left to their own devices.  Then, there's the character of Saki, a senior high school student that befriended the four siblings.  She's been regarded as an 'outsider' by her peers and as a result, she's hanging around in the park to kill time and giving her parents the impression that she's still going to school.  Shouldn't the parents play their part in knowing their own children intimately and caring for their emotional well-being instead of simply catering for their physical well-being?  Thus, many cases of 'hikikomori' situation in Japan where children tend to lose themselves in their own room for years...On top of that, there's Saki again dating older business man to make money for the four siblings.  Remember, everything we saw in this movie was based upon true events!  Overall, this is an unforced movie that slowly unfolds itself and gradually, we get to empathise with the siblings and the plight that they were in.  The theme song in the end really striked it to the core of the matter, that there wasn't really a light at the end of the tunnel and people like those children were really the lost souls or abandoned souls of Japan.  Could those four children and Saki, and even their mother (played by You, a J-Pop singer) represent the fate of the delinquent and rebellious youngsters of modern-day Japan and is there a future for them under the new Koizumi government?  Thus, the movie ending with an open-ended format.  Lest Japan forget...Unforgettable experience and outstanding performances from all cast.  Highly recommended and not to be missed.  Not much extra in DVD but simply subtitle.",1130544000,4,2710,4.982222222222222

However my son came to the rescue, he can change regions on his laptop. So I had to watch the movie on a small screen, but it was still great.  Such a moving story, and as I am a student studying Japanese it was a good learning tool, not too difficult to understand. I recommend it to any student of Japanese.",1129680000,5,470,3.8854166666666665
2363205,3,B000A5044C,"""Nobody Knows"" shows the slow descent of four shockingly abandoned children into an urban savagery of sorts.  It's a harrowing tale, all the more so because it's based on real events.  The script is subtle and well-played by the actors.  You learn, for example, that  Mom's brood comes from four different fathers, none Nobel Prize winners.  In one telling sequence of scenes, the two candidates (a Pachinko gallery worker and taxi driver) who potentially sired the littlest daughter both try to distance themselves from any sense of responsibility.

If you read between the lines at some of the critics' reviews (""unfolds with leisurely beauty"") of ""Nobody Knows,"" what you'll divine is that the film is overly long by about 20 - 30 minutes.  It could have used a good editor.  And, this is one of those movies where you watch and say to each other ""okay, good rental, but I'd be perturbed if I paid $8.50 a ticket at the theater.""

That aside, the acting by the four child protagonists is at a very high level, especially that Yya Yagira, who portrays the eldest son; you can literally see the wight of responsibility eating away at this kid as the movie progresses.  It's a fairly astounding acting job.",1128988800,3,1206,4.7548076923076925
2363206,5,B000A5044C,"Brillant, poignant, a must see!!!  Rarely does a movie move me emotionally and visually to the point where pictures of it linger in my head for many days after.  The perfomances of the actors are amazing.  I felt as I was a fly on the wall watching actual  moments in these characters lives instead of watching a film.  Totally entrancing.  Brillantly filmed, acted and directed.",1128556800,5,379,4.753846153846154
2363207,2,B000A5044C,"Supposedly based on fact, we have a irresponsible mother who has four children all from different fathers, and abandons their kids to persue another relationship (the mom even tells the eldest son she never mentioned her kids to him, and tells him he is being selfish not thinking of her happiness). She eventually never returns, and the four children are left to their own devices to stay alive. The eldest son visits his irresponsible dad needing money but explains he has none having to spend lots on his present girlfriend. Nice guy...

The only problem with this film is not once have the children cried or showed much emotions. You would think-even small kids, would miss their only parent. There are many times I thought the film dragged. None of the neighbors in the apartment noticed something funny going on--where's the mother? (in Japan living quarters are cramped and neighbors are very close by). The water and electricity was cut off. With four children in the apartment, wouldn't they notice the smell (none of the kids kept house clean-it was a pig sty in there).

Even when one of the children had an accident, fell off a chair, and eventually died-not one sibling cried or even thought about getting help, which would be a natural reaction. They just sat around and watched her die. The eldest son put her body in a suitcase and buried it at some airport. mmmm this girl shows up near the end of the show--supposedly becomes friends with the eldest son, and she helps do the deed of burying sister's corpse. Personally I think this lack of emotion is appalling. Why didn't she tell the authorities when she seen how they lived?

An employee at a grocer asked the eldest son...""why haven't you called the authorities."" Eldest son replied he didn't want the family to be separated. I guess he preferred to watch his siblings live in dirt and filth, slowly starve to death, not get an education, and die off. ANd with the lack of emotion with all chidren when their sister died, it made me wonder how on earth this film won the 2004 Cannes International Film Festival award.

Also unrealistic is how did the eldest son pay rent-sure the mother sometimes (extremely rarely) sent money, and it goes fast with four kids. During one scene the landlord's (or his daughter, i forgot which) was asking for rent money. Then all of the sudden rent was no longer an issue. I don't care where you live--RENT IS NOT CHEAP. In real life the landlord would have started eviction procedures. Also the landlord said nothing of the trash and filth all over the apartment when she came to visit, and she CLEARLY seen how the apartment looks like.  A REAL landlord would have been livid. Eviction process.

I know all the critics gave it rave reviews, but I'm telling you my honest opinion of the movie--it was slow, and far from realistic in the midst of child abandonment and how the children would react to that, and the general lack of pure emotion (nobody cried) impossible to grasp.

This is NOT a movie I would want to see twice, but okay to rent. It was, to me, a so-so movie.",1127865600,10,3081,4.631868131868132
2363208,5,B000A5044C,"Casual human indifference to the plight of others is one of the horror stories in modern urban life. Witness the now nearly mythic knife stabbing murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City, the multiple stories of parental neglect and social services failures in every major city, and most recently, the left behind victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. In NOBODY KNOWS, Hirokazu Kore-Eda presents a brilliantly understated but chilling tale of a society's indifference to its children.

After an opening scene whose significance can only be understood at the movie's end, NOBODY KNOWS begins with the happy scene of a 12-year-old boy (Akiro) and his mother presenting a thank you gift to their new landlord, his wife, and their doe-eyed little dog. The landlord rather untactfully asks for Akiro's age and then comments that he doesn't rent to families with smaller children because they are too noisy. By the next scene, we are watching two small children, Shigeru and Yuki, tumble out of the suitcases in which their mother has smuggled them into the apartment. Still another daughter appears momentarily, and mom is soon surrounded by four children, all of whom we learn have different fathers, all absent. Mother appears to have both the voice and mental capacity of a ten-year-old, and after her first, one-month disappearance, she leaves a second time and never returns.

Not surprisingly, the movie's central drama concerns the four children's ability to survive sans parents. They live first on money left for them by their mother, then from small offerings from two of their fathers, and then by Akira's wits. Oldest daughter Kyoko dreams of going to school and buying herself a piano, younger son Shigeru longs to play outdoors, and the youngest, Yuki, draws pictures until her crayons are mere nubs. At first, the children keep the apartment and themselves clean, but as time passes, everything deteriorates, including their health and their clothing. The four children's slow but steady decline into a state of near wildness is reminiscent of LORD OF THE FLIES, but without the internecine conflicts and war gaming. Even when an older girl, Saki, befriends Akira and his siblings, nothing seems to prevent their inevitable slide into a sort of urban savagery. Kore-Eda evokes palpable feelings of revulsion mixed with pity for the children and anger at every adult with whom they come into contact. We can only watch, horrified, as the children regress into mere shadows of their former selves, penniless, malnourished, and barely able to lift themselves from their mats on the floor until, finally, tragedy strikes.

It is impossible not to see NOBODY KNOWS as an indictment of Japanese society as cold, self-centered, and uncaring. Kore-Eda's responsible adults take no notice of the children, even when they are brushing their teeth and washing their clothes in the faucet of a local public park. The only substantive assistance the kids receive comes from Saki and two young workers at a local food store, as if the older generations (the mother, the fathers, the landlord's wife, and even the electric company) are complete bereft of care or human decency. Curiously, somewhat the same critique of Japanese society emerges out of Haruki Murakami's documentary novel UNDERGROUND, which describes the serin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system.

Fans of Kore-Eda's wonderful earlier movie, AFTER LIFE, will find NOBODY KNOWS to be a bleak but powerful tale of modern urban life. This is a gritty and edgy movie that slowly gets inside your skin and lodges under your fingernails until you feel as dirtied and desperate as those four children. For those viewing Kore-Eda for the first time with NOBODY KNOWS, follow this movie up with AFTER LIFE and be introduced to a master cinematic storyteller whose movies will leave you thinking. In today's movie world, that is an exception, and a real treat.",1127606400,5,3921,5.083850931677019
