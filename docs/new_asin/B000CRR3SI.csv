2471986,5,B000CRR3SI,"I am very excited that Universal has stepped up its releases for Murder, She Wrote. I have just finished watching the first and second season in chronology and can not wait for season 3. The series just keeps getting better. Death Stalks the Big Top is a particular favorite as Jackie Cooper plays her long lost brother in law. Ever the Fletcherfan, I recommend this series  if you enjoy mysteries. Angela Lansbury is delightful as are her guests.",1135987200,29,447,4.730769230769231
2471987,5,B000CRR3SI,"I'm so glad to see Universal is releasing Murder She Wrote Season Three on March 14, 2006 ..looking forward getting this season...this is the best season.  I enjoyed some of the episodes such as: Stage Struck (seeing my favorite Eleanor Parker), Magnum on Ice, The Corpse Flew First Class, Deadline for Murder, The Bottom Line is Murder and Death Stalks the Big Top.  I will be watching this wonderful season when its released.  Murder She Wrote is my favorite television show...have first and second seasons - will be getting third and other seasons as well.",1134518400,10,559,4.863157894736842

2471991,5,B000CRR3SI,"The best enduring reason to keep watching this series is Angela Lansbury.  I know of no other actress who has had such an accomplished career in theater, film, and television.  Although the television industry has been especially remiss in not awarding her a much-deserved Emmy.  Shes due an honorary one if nothing else, for all the great work she did as Jessica Fletcher.",1500422400,,373,4.888888888888889

2472034,4,B000CRR3SI,"This 1986-87 Season mystery series that ran on CBS from 1984-96 about this QUINCY like popular novelist, Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) who was always snooped around crime scenes and frequently ended up solving homicide investigations before the cops did just like Dr. Quincy (Jack Klugman) on QUINCY, M.E.

This 1986-1987 Season was also the season when Jessica meets the 1980's sexiest private investigator, Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck) in MURDER SHE WROTE's crossover episode ""Magnum On Ice"" when Jessica travels to Hawaii teaming up with Magnum on a murder investigation in Honolulu, which results in Magnum getting falsely arrested when a nemesis is found killed in cold blood.

This 1984-96 series takes me back to memory lane to when MURDER SHE WROTE was on CBS every Sunday night at 8PM following 60 MINUTES and when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade.

MURDER SHE WROTE's 3rd Season also takes me back to memory lane to when CBS's motto was ""Share The Spirit"" , from the Fall of 1986 thru the Summer of 1987.",1422748800,,1021,4.85632183908046

2472089,4,B000CRR3SI,"Overall we have enjoyed the complete 12 years. First of all, the picture guality is excellent thruout the whole ser ies. But the first (3)
seasons are on DBL sided disc, and there were a lot of hangups (freezes) thru all (3) seasons.(more of a nuisance than a problem).
There were no more problems after they went to a regular disc. The worse problem to me and my wife is the sound! The background music is much louder than the dialog (voices),so at times it almost drowns out what they are saying. But it was still worth what we paid, and overall we were pretty happy with the series. Absolutely no problem with AMAZON they are great. We have ordered from them many times and everything we have ordered has come quickly and packaged very well. We have not had
any problems with them at all.  Robert and Anita Buckley----NC",1372896000,,823,4.486666666666666

2472091,5,B000CRR3SI,"II've enjoyed Murder, She Wrote for years, now I'm finally buying it.  The DVD and quality is excellent.  I can use closed captions.  The people I bought it from were prompt in their delivery, and it was well packaged.  No dispute on billing.  Almost everything was great, but navigating on the DVD is a little unusual, trying to use the closed captions.  Also, they put  the show on BOTH sides of the DVD.  That makes it so much easier to scratch and mar.  I don't like that at all.",1371686400,,483,4.337078651685394

2472131,5,B000CRR3SI,"My wife and I had been watching ""Murder, She Wrote"" as late-night programming and we  enjoyed it very much through the first and second season. Then we took a break. Later we came back and resumed Season Three.

It's a good series. It's easy and enjoyable watching and the plots take twists and turns that are sometimes hard to follow. Now and then we have it figured out before the end of the program. In any case, it's a good thing to watch late at night. It's light entertainment and is not too thought provoking. It's very interesting to look back on the 80s, almost like a period movie. In this particular season, it's been enjoyable to spot all the actors we know from other places, and it's interesting to see them in their youth. My wife has spotted four ""Star Trek"" (various series) actors and a couple from ""Big Love."" I've spotted a couple more known actors. It adds enjoyment to the viewing.

It was our impression that Season One was somewhat better than Season Two, and it's now our impression that Season Three is back to Season One in quality and enjoyment. I'd say the violence, never very high, has been upped a bit in Season Three, but it falls  totally within acceptable limits, especially for a series that focuses on murder mysteries.

Some people have complained about the recording of the DVD on both sides. It's a bit unusual, but we've had no problems with it. Also, there are complaints about the DVD quality. We have had no problems here either. The three complete seasons we have now watched on DVD have all functioned perfectly.

In the better episodes, you are not told ""who-dun-it"" till near the end.  We did not get to see these on TV, and we prefer them over other similar shows for their style.  Angela Lansbury plays a friendly, caring, down-home person who seems to have a knack for ending up in the middle of a murder case, that's all.",1207008000,,487,4.4772727272727275
2472147,4,B000CRR3SI,"Anyone who is considering buying Season three of ""Murder She Wrote"" has probably already seen Seasons one and two of this series, so should already be familiar with the basic plot line of this series - mystery writer, Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) travels around the world, solving a murder at each stop (considering the fact that a murder occurs everywhere she goes, you'd think the police would arrest her on suspicion - the circumstantial evidence is staggering). There are no big surprises in Season three of ""Murder She Wrote"", Jessica Fletcher continues doing what she does best and she does it well.

There is the usual abundance of guest stars: highlights include George Clooney, Courtney Cox and Leslie Nielsen, as well as Tom Bosley and William Windom, reprising their roles as Sheriff Tupper and Doc Haslett, respectively. This season also includes the two ""Magnum P.I.""/ ""Murder She Wrote"" cross-over episodes (the first half of this double-episode was an episode of ""Magnum P.I."", which is included in this set as a special feature). Personally, I found the cross-over episodes to be some of the weakest of this season, but, nevertheless, this is still a solid season that will not disappoint fans.",1206230400,,1216,5.08

I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Three [1986-87] is as entertaining as ever. I have to say that though I love all the locations for the stories, my favorite is Cabot Cove, Maine and I just adore the quirky townspeople and the scandals around them!

In Season Three, we have some noted guest-stars such as Leslie Nielsen, Hayley Mills, Tom Selleck of Magnum P.I. fame, Bob Hastings, Eleanor Parker, Fritz Weaver, Shaun Cassidy, Ernest Borgnine, Tess Harper, a much younger George Clooney etc. With such talents abounding in each episode, its no wonder that watching this series is such a pleasure! The stories are creative and well-written, with a cohesive plotline and of course, stellar acting.

Angela Lansbury s such a talented actress and continues to amaze till today [at 82!]. What I love most about her portrayal of J.B. Fletcher is that she plays a strong, intelligent, and attractive middle-aged lady [such roles are so scarce in Hollywood], and managed to entertain audiences for 12 years in her most-famous screen role!

This season MS  Lansbury seems to be getting more comfortable with the character of JB Fletcher as she always does with the every character she plays.

In this season you will see Guest stars like Courtney Cox, before she became a friend and an Arquette in the season opener and the first two parter for the series where she plays a niece of Jesica's who'se about to get married.  Other guest stars are George Clooney, before he became Dr Ross on ER and there is a crossover episode of Magnum PI and you get both episodes of that the Magnum episode is the special features on side B of Disc 3.

2472163,5,B000CRR3SI,"It took me only two weeks to watch all 22 episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote"" - The Complete Third Season. And my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two: just more mystery fun with Angela Lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver Jessica Fletcher.

Familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three, including recent ""Syriana"" Oscar winner George Clooney, past Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine (""The Poseidon Adventure"") and Martin Balsam (""Psycho""), ""Friends"" alum Courtney Cox Arquette, ""Brady Bunch"" veterans Florence Henderson and Barry Williams, veteran comic Buddy Hackett, and ""Naked Gun"" star Leslie Nielsen. Other guest stars include: Gloria Stuart (""Titanic""), G.W. Bailey (""Police Academy""), Tess Harper (""Tender Mercies""), Jessica Walter (""Arrested Development""), Hayley Mills (""The Parent Trap""), Bill Macy (""Maude""), Genie Francis (""General Hospital""), Dinah Manoff (""Empty Nest""), and Harry Morgan (""M*A*S*H""). Three stars from the ""Star Trek"" TV shows turned up for guest appearences: George Takei (the original ""Star Trek"" series), LeVar Burton (""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), and Kate Mulgrew (""Star Trek: Voyager""). Erin Moran, best known for playing Joannie on the popular '70s sitcom ""Happy Days"", guest starred in the third episode of season three titled ""Unfinished Business"", which reunited her with ""Happy Days"" co-star Tom Bosley, who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of ""Murder, She Wrote"" as Amos Tupper, the sheriff of Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine (I've very much enjoyed Bosley's appearences on ""Murder, She Wrote"" as well as William Windom's reoccuring appearences as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt). And in an interesting scenario, Tom Selleck and John Hillerman turn up in their ""Magnum P.I."" roles as part of a cross-over episode, with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of ""Magnum P.I."" (which was in its seventh season) and concluding with an episode of ""Murder, She Wrote"" (episode #8 to be exact). That episode of ""Magnum P.I."" is featured as a bonus on season three of ""Murder, She Wrote"".

The ""Magnum P.I.""/""Murder, She Wrote"" cross-over episodes (titled ""Novel Connection"" and ""Magnum on Ice"") were a favorite of mine. Other great episodes from season three include: ""Death Stalks the Big Top"" parts 1 and 2, ""Unfinished Business"", ""Obituary For A Dead Anchor"", ""The Corpse Flew First Class"", ""Crossed Up"", ""Simon Says, Color Me Dead"", ""No Laughing Murder"", ""No Accounting For Murder"", and ""Murder, She Spoke"".

""Murder, She Wrote"" season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime, and Lansbury is wonderful as usual. I'm sure the fun will continue with season four!",1143590400,57,2762,5.344827586206897

2472165,5,B000CRR3SI,"Hello everyone, I am a avid fan of Murder She Wrote and I love that they came out on DVD.  I can't wait to recieve the latest season.

Now about the previous comments about the last season DVDs.  Now on the first set I watch all the episodes without no problem.  When it came to Season 2, I had pixelization on one episode on the second DVD and a pause and going no further on at least two episodes on the last DVD.

Now let me tell you a solution and how wonderful amazon.com is.  I sent an email to customer service about my problem.  They replied saying that they will send me a new set, at no charge to me.  They told to watch the new set and see if the same things would occur and if not to send the defective set back to them, and they will pay postage.

I said to myself, YEAH!, I don't have to pay for them to ship me one or for me to ship it back to them.  Now with the second set, the things did not occurred that happened with the first set.  If you are having trouble, email Amazon and they will help you.  They did it for me.

Thanks for reading. :)",1142208000,70,1062,3.9065420560747666
2472166,1,B000CRR3SI,"I had the same problem with the episodes freezing on both Season One and Season Two.  I've also had the same problem on Season Two of Columbo and Season One of McMillan and Wife.  All the series are from Universal.  I assume they are trying to cram the most content onto the fewest discs, and taking shortcuts to get there.  I will NOT be buying anymore series from them until I read that the problem is fixed.",1141257600,14,410,4.285714285714286
2472167,1,B000CRR3SI,"I have had the same problem as most of the other reviewers - DVDs that stick at a certain point and won't budge.

In addition, I was excited about this set because, as someone who knows the episodes nearly by heart and who is also learning French, I was looking forward to using it as a great teaching tool. Stupidly, the second season has only Spanish captions and the third season none at all in a foreign language.

How utterly ignorant is this? Obviously if someone bought the first season for its French captions they would expect to have them throughout the series. What a dreadful disappointment, I can tell you.

I won't buy again until the complete series (all 12 seasons) provides great viewing and identical caption choices. I called Universal, who promised to get back to me but never did.

Ms. Lansbury, perhaps you can help us?! We're all more than willing to spend our money - but not on what's being provided now.",1140739200,17,929,4.578313253012048
2472168,5,B000CRR3SI,"I own both seasons 1 & 2 and it is a complete delight. I remember sitting with my Mom and watching them on CBS, and owning them just brings back the fond memories of family time. Angela Lansbury was perfect for this role (as she was in all her roles in film and on stage). The guest stars chosen in each episode create a fun, gentle believability in their roles. Great gift for young, old and in-between.",1140739200,6,404,4.259740259740259
2472169,1,B000CRR3SI,I have the first season box set which I love but when ordering season two there are at least 2 episodes I can't even watch because it is so distorted and it pauses and will go no further. I am so disappointed.  As much as I would love to get the 3rd season I am not willing to pay the price for a dvd that may or maynot work.,1137974400,20,325,3.710144927536232
2472170,5,B000CRR3SI,"As far as i know the reviews are to be done on the show not the quality of discs. No problems here with any discs. Thats an issue to take outside this site. Now on the show: Funny i hardly watched this show when it first came out and now ive become addicted to it. Theres just no mystery/suspense show like this on tv anymore.  Its suspenseful, tasteful and with some twists of humor as well. Definately a collection to own you can watch over and over again.",1137110400,5,458,4.204545454545454
2472171,1,B000CRR3SI,"I love this show and had been looking forward to the dvd release of the show. But after the reviews and the problems i've personally experienced i'm ready to give up. My first season was a birthday gift and surprise of surprises all discs ran the first time watched. So I asked for the second season for Christmas and i was so looking forward to it- I've had to return it twice because of the glitches and distortion and stopping and not being able to continue the ep. I'm at my wits end. Here is the email for Universal-USHE.ConsumerRelations@worldmarkinc.com

everyone please email and make them rerelease these as single sided better quality discs. and make them exchange our potentially problematic ones for free. We own another series that's on two sided discs- played fine the first time but after additional viewings it's had these problems so even if my first season hasn't had a problem the first run- i know that can change. I'm afraid to watch it again- which is not why we collect these shows! Maybe if we all boycott Universal products and overwhelm them with emails it will help. They've ruined a great show! and i was so looking forward to the third season too but i can't keep going thru this!!  NOT WORTH IT!!",1137110400,30,1226,4.6192660550458715
