8483848,4,B005QW0I3Q,Good thing about the DVD is that there is plenty of Chinese dialogue. However the quality of the animation isn't the best. This doesn't make it any less appealing to a 2 yr old though! It would have been nice if they included some chinese songs. However I will be getting the other DVDs in the series once we have this one mastered!,1367539200,,332,4.285714285714286
8483849,5,B005QW0I3Q,I like the rate of how this product teaches Chinese. Not too fast but not too slow either. It teaches colors and a few phrases.,1353715200,4,127,4.12
