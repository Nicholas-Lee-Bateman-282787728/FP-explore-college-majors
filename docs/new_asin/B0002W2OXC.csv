Scheider, the only real star in this one, was subsequently type-cast, (especially by ""Jaws""), and here, in what was surely a very early career entry, he plays a divergent role as the family drunk and weakling.

The story, which takes place in 1898, is about a rotten and rich old patriarch who suffers from catylepsy and, following the pronouncement of his death by the oldest son who is a very cheesy and unethical doctor, the family hurriedly secures his casket in a masauleum. They quickly want RID of all traces of the old scoundrel as he has tormented each of them unmercifully over the years. Since the old bugger was always terrified of being buried alive, in his will he had assigned each and every family member, as well as a trusted servant, a little task which would allow him to escape his tomb in case he might not really have died. The family, for the most part, is as rotten as was the old man and they promptly ignore his testamentary directives, much to the consternation of the family lawyer, the controller of the family money, and who hangs around the mansion all the time.

Stated in the old man's will was also a direct threat against each family member who failed to carry out his assigned task, (e.g., ""Don't lock the masauleum door!""), in addition to their being financially cut out of the will: the daughter fears water, the widow fears fire, the doctor-son fears disfigurement, etc. So, you pretty much KNOW, right off the bat, what's going to happen to these folks.

About halfway through the film, a buffoon of a police inspector is called in to investigate the deaths that have transpired so far, and he's assisted by his equally inept constable. These two also hang around the old mansion to make sure that there are no more murders, albeit they are not very successful in this endeavor.

About the only bright figures among the family spore are a nephew and his pretty wife, both of whom the old man apparently liked somewhat -- but even these two are still under the testamentary threat just like the rest of the clan. Still, the viewing audience at least has a couple of characters who are sympathetic to root for, which generates some additional subtle level of suspense.

The murder-fare includes a chopped off head, some very nasty quicksand, and various other vehicles of horrific death. We're also treated to the old secret panel in the library and, the eyes peeping from behind the portrait routines. The `Living Corpse' slinks around in a long cape and his face is covered by a black scarf, revealing only his eyes... sort of a Bela Lugosi `Plan 9' look.

The biggest actual problem with this film is that the director chose to make the horror/mystery facet serious, and the police activities as a tongue-in-cheek operation -- in this movie, the two concepts fail to mesh. Beyond that, the cinematography is pretty darn good, and the sets are really tops, all of which helps to save the film. Also, Scheider is pretty convincing in his role which also aids in carrying the film.

Finally, this flick really doesn't drag at any point which is an unexpected, but pleasant, surprise. This movie's not as good as an early Roger Corman film (e.g., ""Dementia 13""), but it's okay.

If you're not into horror/mystery cult films, skip this one. If you're a fan of such productions then you'll probably enjoy it as I did.",1193011200,5,3525,4.681744749596123
