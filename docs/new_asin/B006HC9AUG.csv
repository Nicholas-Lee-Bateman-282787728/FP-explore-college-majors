8498304,4,B006HC9AUG,"My past experience with this opera has been somewhat mixed.  I usually come away feeling as if it is somewhat disjointed, although I love the music very much.  This particular production, however, sits very well with me.  From the opening, there is a visual metaphor of the film negative, and the feeling that the operatic action is being viewed inside a camera.  This interesting idea is leveraged by animations that show the characters actions and thoughts, and provide graphical referents that help tie the various loose strands of the operatic action together.

As for the music, it is performed extremely well by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala.  It is delightful, lively, and very complimentary to the vocal talents (which are exceptional) of the principal characters.  Albina Shagimuratova's Queen of the Night is just excellent, and Papageno (played by Alex Esposito) is a delight to watch.  And Genia Kuhmeier's (Pamina) performance of ""Ach, ich fuhl's"" is just wonderful.

I can honestly say that this is the first production of this opera that I have enjoyed from beginning to end.  This was a wonderful addition to my collection, and I am glad I have this particular production. I enjoyed this production very much, and it will certainly be viewed on more than one occasion.  Recommended!",1344124800,6,1318,5.027649769585254
8498305,4,B006HC9AUG,"I found the camera idea a bit too clever and it made the production too dark. Yes it is well sung and acted but the Flute is an opera that thrives on magic, colour and costume. There are other productions about, notably by Opera Australia, that bring this most wonderful of operas to life even better and I hope they will soon get a Blu-ray recording. In the meantime I found this better than the Covent Garden production but not by a lot and neither quite meet my aspirations.",1331769600,2,477,4.370786516853933
8498306,4,B006HC9AUG,"Die Zauberflte still represents a challenge that has perhaps been neglected in recent times by the major modern revisionist directors in favour of finding new ways to explore the Mozart/Da Ponte trilogy of works - The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cos Fan Tutte - so a fresh approach is always welcome. William Kentridge, the stage director for this production of Die Zauberflte at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan may not have any new ideas about the opera's central theme of light versus darkness being that of man seeking to rise above their baser natures and impulses, seeking enlightenment over obscurantism, or rationalism over superstition, but as an artist, illustrator and animator the South African director does at least approach these themes with a very distinct style of his own.

The period setting chosen appears to be late 19th century, the beginning of the age of technological advancement, the characters dressed to looking like figures from a Jules Verne or a H.G Wells novel. At the centre of these scientific advances in this production is the camera, a box that in itself represents the use of light - the ingenuity of man - to forge something out of the darkness, much as Mozart uses the music of the magic flute for the same purpose. Within the box of the stage, Kentridge uses shadows and light in a variety of ways that fits in well with this theme, as well as often being visually very striking. Thus, in the opening of Act 1, Tamino battles with a snake that is a projection created by the three ladies of the Queen of the Night, who form it out of the shadowplay of their arms. So right from the outset, Tamino literally defeats a shadow of the forces of darkness, working effectively and in keeping with a meaningful overall concept. Elsewhere, through black-and-white reversal charcoal designs, animation and even some silent movie footage Kentridge finds a variety of means to illustrate the journey and trials of the protagonists, their acquisition of wisdom and knowledge, as well as reflect the symbolism, numerology and the Masonic imagery that is associated with the themes of the opera.

The orchestration here sounds somewhat lifeless, and no-one on the stage - with the exception of Alex Exposito's Papageno, looks like they are having much fun with what should be a delightfully invigorating work. I'm presuming that the arrangement used here by Ronald Ber is period - or more likely semi-period for La Scala - but it feels like there is a distinct lack of verve in the playing and the performances. In a good interview in the extra features, Ber recognises that Die Zauberflte contains all the different facets of Mozart's work, but the complex personality of Mozart himself is in there too, reflected in each of the characters, and that doesn't always come across here. Tamino can be a difficult role to breathe any personality into, but you don't necessarily need to - the character's (and Mozart's) purity, youthful idealism and single-minded determination (yet one that is open to new ideas and a sense of betterment) is all there in the music and Saimir Pirgu sings it beautifully. So too does Genia Khmeier's Pamina represent the other side of that nature with a similar clear purity of voice - her 'Ach, ich fhl's' is one of the loveliest I've heard. Alex Exposito is the only figure who demonstrates any kind of life and personality, and he sings Papageno well with clear diction. Where Die Zauberflte really needs character however, a sense of grandness and imperiousness to give depth and gravity to the work, is in the opposing forces of Sarastro and the Queen of the Night, and unfortunately, neither Albina Shagimuratova nor Gnther Groissbck are entirely up to the task.

All in all however, if it's a little dryly performed and lacking a little bit of spark, this is nonetheless a strong performance of Die Zauberflte that manages to take a fresh approach to the score and the themes of the work. It's certainly worthwhile for William Kentridge's unique approach to production design that makes this never anything less than a rich and imaginative spectacle. The Blu-ray is of the usual high video and audio standards, with extra features consisting of a Cast Gallery and a very interesting twelve-minute Interview with the director and conductor.
