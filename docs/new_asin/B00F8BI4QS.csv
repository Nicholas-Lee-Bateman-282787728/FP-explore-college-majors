5970230,5,B00F8BI4QS,The game is a show that has a inside fun view of the game of football  and there lives. It is fun and entertaining and some insight into the black cultures.,1389657600,,156,4.032258064516129
5970231,5,B00F8BI4QS,"Can't wait for more.  I love to binge watch, wish it was available to stream and download all at one.  Now I have to wait for the next season before I can get my next fix.",1389571200,,171,3.7222222222222223
5970232,4,B00F8BI4QS,"The show is still not as good as it was when Melanie and Derwin were on the show, but the addition of Lauren London and the new football dude brought some cool drama to the set. I am still loyally watching - this was much better than season 5!",1389484800,,243,3.979591836734694
5970233,5,B00F8BI4QS,"This was a really good season. I would recommend anyone to watch it, I can hardly wait for the next season",1389484800,,106,4.095238095238095
5970234,2,B00F8BI4QS,don't like blue print or keira just doesn't seem the same..hope season 7 is better.i hear its suppose 2 be/ and I wrote in cause season 6 was blurry 2 watch and I haven't ever had that before......so I won't be getting anymore seasons of anything here.,1389398400,5,252,4.382978723404255
5970235,4,B00F8BI4QS,"In my opinion this season was much better than the previous season. The story line between Keira and Blue, Malik's somewhat maturity, and Jason's marriage to Chardonnay were all better than the previous season.",1389139200,,210,5.205882352941177
5970236,5,B00F8BI4QS,I got it late by two days smaxon returned my shipping fee two days it was due to arrive... Anyway I just wanted to look wt a fee episodes and ending up watching the whole season..It was awesome. .csnt wait for next season.,1388448000,,222,4.186046511627907
5970237,5,B00F8BI4QS,"Shortly before the start of The Game Sixth Season Mara Brock Akil (the series creator/executive producer) tweeted me back and said this season will have 20 blazin episodes I was a little skeptical because I didn't if she was overhyping, because as many of you all know the series leads Melanie and Derwin played by Tia Mowry and Pooch Hall bowed out of the series at the end of season 5, although Pooch gives his best performance of the whole series with his memorable farewell at the top of the season with his trade. But, let me tell you this whole season was on fiyaaaaaa *Alicia Keys voice*.  The way the show is shot has changed, the laugh track is gone, and has resulted in a very fresh show! Everyone and everything looks fresh. Blue (Jay Ellis) and Keira (Lauren London) were a great addition with their organic chemistry and realistic storyline. Jason is back playing for the Sabers but will it cause problems for his new wife Chardonnay (Brandy)? Malik comes at a crossroad in his life this season and tries to prep for his life after football in the business world, but will his old ways while trying to move forward with his life cost him the ultimate price? Tasha finally had that man she had been praying forever for at the end of season 5 with longtime friend Pookie, but her boyfriend Rick Fox has returned which leads to a love triangle and a huge personal growth for her.  All episodes appear to be unedited; in fact some scenes look like they have been slightly extended while all music is intact. A gag reel and deleted scenes on almost half the episodes make this set a touchdown!
By me a football fan I wanted to see more of why THE BLUEPRINT was this legend/media hype. But, overall I am thoroughly satisfied with the storyline this season. Great storytelling on the writers part! I can tell this season was well thought out. Only disappointing thing about the DVD is there is bonus feature or mention about the season opener being the 100th episode. However, this is a must buy!!!!

Favorite episodes
*The Blueprint part 1 and 2-S/O to that hot ass intro!!
*Guess whos Bizzack and Welcome to the Jungle (these are two hell of an episodes that bring back S1 rookie/sunbeam angle of The Game)
*Pssh Im Good!!
*In Treatment- This episode is for all the Tasha and Malik relationships out there. This is Tashas breakthrough episode she goes to therapy to peel back the many layers of Tasha Miggity Mack. We learn a lot about her background complete with herself at different stages in her life and also a younger version of Malik. Very powerful and relatable episode.",1387756800,,2586,4.593073593073593
5970238,5,B00F8BI4QS,"Season 6 proved to be very entertaining television. The reason being that The Game did a solid job of re-inventing itself. It was a very bold move to replace the leads (Melanie & Derwin) with 2 new characters (Kiera & Blue). At first I was skeptical about whether this was the right decision. But without even realizing, it was a change that the show truly needed (The angles of Melanie & Derwin had run their course at least 2 seasons ago). Though Kiera & Blue do present the typical problems of a new couple, their back stories are very fresh and provide new ground to tap into. This season also enabled viewers to better understand Jason as a ""significant other"" for the honeymoon phase of his new marriage to Chardonnay has ended, leaving the married couple to handle real business at hand. The character of Tasha comes across as much more annoying this season, but this provides the lead-in to her entangled life's breaking point (which made for interesting revelations). Malik continues to be Malik, though in new situations to challenge him (truly for the worst), as well as others around the troubled star. The show is strong once again. Due to return March 2014, we can expect the return of Kelly (Jason's ex-wife), solidifying the fact that The Game is no longer limited to a ""game"" as it continues to kick the door open on the trials and tribulations of everyday life.",1386115200,7,1379,4.679012345679013

5970274,5,B00F8BI4QS,"Season 6 of ""The Game"" saw us saying goodbye to the lead characters Derwin and Melanie Davis, and welcoming two new characters, new football recruit Bryce ""Blueprint (Blue)"" Westbrook and former child actress Keira Whitaker. It was tough to see The Davis' go. They were the glue that held the show together. I was happy that Pooch Hall (Derwin) returned in the season premiere to give his character a proper send off. Pooch gave his BEST performance ever on the season premiere, making it even harder to see Derwin go. Blue and Keira were nice additions to the show. Their hot and cold relationship reminded us of Derwin and Melanie before marriage. Malik was still being his arrogant self, Jason was still being a cheap a**, but it was good to see his new sharp tongued wife Chardonnay (Brandy) keep him in check. Tasha was still her lovable ghetto self, trying to maintain two romantic relationships (Pookie and Rick Fox). This season was a step up from Season 5. The shows were more concise and enjoyable. One of the best TV shows in the TV game.",1403827200,2,1049,4.645161290322581
5970275,5,B00F8BI4QS,I hope The Game comes back with a season 8. I want Derwin and Melinie to come back. I do love Lauren London and Jay Ellis though. I wonder will Jason (Cobey Bell) rekindle his relationship with Kelly ( Britney Daniel ) in season 8.  Will they get married again?  Will Tasha (Wendy Raquel Robinson) & pookie get back together now that they have a daughter together.? Will Maliek  (Hosea Chanez) settle down with one woman and have a family of his own?,1402185600,,450,4.397590361445783
5970276,5,B00F8BI4QS,I'm a big fan of this show! I've always been a fan since the first season. I hope they keep them coming!,1395705600,,104,3.772727272727273
5970277,1,B00F8BI4QS,I miss the old cast. Bring back Melony and Derwin !!!!! They are definitely missed. They made the show what it is!!!!!,1395187200,7,118,4.409090909090909
5970278,2,B00F8BI4QS,"I didn't think the show would be the same, and it's not. It definitely is different. I didn't think I would like it, but it was actually quite good. Tension, drama, comedy - it all makes for a good season. This season we see Malik evolving, get introduced to Blue and Kiera, and see how Jason develops as a husband",1394064000,2,314,4.25
5970279,4,B00F8BI4QS,"Best show ever! Season 6 is filled with unexpected events and great twists, love scenes. Although the cast is different I've really enjoyed watching it",1393632000,,151,5.08

5970282,5,B00F8BI4QS,"But I am getting used to Blu, And Keira. They are cute together. But the back and fourth gets a little old. Please give Tasha a man she can keep.",1392076800,,145,3.8666666666666667
5970283,5,B00F8BI4QS,"I felt like Season 6 of ""The Game"" is the best season of the show, and glad that they change the storyline to keep the show more interesting! People may not understand it, but it fits perfectly with what's going on!! Brandy Norwood as Chardonnay Pitts brings a whole new aspect for the show as classy & comedic timing!!",1391904000,,319,4.423728813559322
5970284,5,B00F8BI4QS,This series is awesome the and I was very happy with purchasing it on Amazon. I look forward to purchasing my next series.,1391126400,,122,4.3478260869565215
5970285,4,B00F8BI4QS,I really wish Derwin & Melanie were still on the show. And that there were more exciting story lines. Blu and Keira aren't that exciting.,1390867200,,137,4.52
5970286,2,B00F8BI4QS,"I liked Vanessa, Derwin, and Kelly better as co-stars than the other new losers with the exception of Brandi.  That girl can act and plays her role well! I hope Season 7 and 8 will bring some of the old stars back. :(",1390780800,5,217,4.046511627906977
5970287,4,B00F8BI4QS,"Overall, the ""Game: The Sixth Season"" was entertaining and I enjoyed the new story lines.  However, after developing a connection with Melanie (Tia Mowry) and Derwin's (Pooch Hall) character's over 5 seasons, it was a bit of a shock to have the show's main focal points absent from the cast.  (***Spoiler Alert***) Hall only makes a cameo appearance in the first episode, and Mowry's character is reduced to a series of phone calls on Derwin's cell. This was a major let down.  And though Blue and Kiera try to pick up the slack, the void left behind by the Game's flagship couple is simply too wide for these greenhorns to fill. Kelly Pitts' previous departure only adds to this major crack in the show's foundation.

Although I'm not trying to see anyone lose their acting gig, it's hard to incorporate new leads into an established show.  ""Good Times"" tried to do so, when Esther Rolle and John Amos departed the show, only to see Rolle return at a later time to try to buoy a sinking sitcom.  The show was not the same without her.  Ditto for the show ""Girlfriends"" when it parted ways with Jill Marie Jones (Toni Childs) in its later years. Her departure was accompanied by a downward trend in viewership over the following years. I believe the show ""Law & Order SVU"" is suffering from the same type of lead character departures and rapidly approaching the point of ""jumping the shark.""

In short, though I wouldn't dissuade a die hard ""The Game"" lover from buying this dvd set, I hope that a sincere effort is made on the part of the show's producers to reunite the original cast.  This show had a magical synergy that even led to an unprecedented revival of the show (on BET) after it was canned.  That push from viewers had a lot to do with their attachment to the relationship between Pooch Hall and Tia Mowry.  Without it, the Game continues to feel more like an exhibition.",1390608000,10,1884,4.5773809523809526
