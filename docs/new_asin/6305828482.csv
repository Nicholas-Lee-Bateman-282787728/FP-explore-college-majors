7896563,4,6305828482,"REACHING FOR THE MOON (UA, 1931) is a very good pre-code comedy/drama about a millionaire stockholder (Douglas Fairbanks) romancing an aviatrix (Bebe Daniels) aboard an ocean liner bound from New York to Southampton, who learns en-route that he's been ruined when the market crashes.

Written and directed by Edmund Goulding from a story by Irving Berlin, REACHING FOR THE MOON is a disarmingly interesting early talkie for several reasons. The great silent screen idol Douglas Fairbanks is charming and energetic playing a character who's essentially himself, right down to being a teetotaler. He's funny when disrupting a stuffy board meeting as well as quite touching in his more intimate scenes with the beautiful and chic Bebe Daniels. This is also one of the earliest screen appearances of Bing Crosby, who sings Irving Berlin's snappy ""The Mean Lowdown"" in the film's big showcase scene. The stylish, art-deco sets are by one of Hollywood's top designers, William Cameron Menzies. Any film, no matter how mundane, is automatically made worthwhile by Menzies' skillful contribution, and the impressive opening sequence of REACHING FOR THE MOON is a camera dolly into an elaborate miniature set of skyscrapers.

I first saw this movie on TV one New Year's Eve many years ago, and I was immediately sucked into its authentic depiction of how the Crash of '29 caught a lot of people off guard, changing their lives in an instant. Fairbanks gets the news of his sudden bankruptcy while he's living it up on a cruise ship. His declaration of love for Bebe Daniels is played out with genuine sincerity, as is the later scene when, learning that he's broke, Fairbanks tells her that their brief encounter was just ""reaching for the moon.""

Synergy Entertainment's DVD-R is the best version available on REACHING FOR THE MOON; it's sharp, with good contrast and clear audio. Anyone who enjoys jazzy, pre-code early talkies will want this one in their collection. Reach for it.

7896564,3,6305828482,"Reaching for the Moon is a good movie, but it could have been better with some changes. Bebe Daniels does a great job in this film; but poor Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. just doesn't cut it--his higher-pitched voice simply doesn't match my expectations for a tough guy who could still do remarkable acrobatics at the age of 47! His character, a wealthy businessman, seems rather manic at times, too. The plot, however, moves along at a rather good pace and I was never bored. There's also a great performance by Edward Everett Horton as Roger, the valet to the wealthy businessman in this story.

When the action begins, we quickly meet wealthy aviatrix Vivian Benton (Bebe Daniels) who is engaged to the somewhat stuffy Sir Horace Partington Chelmsford (Claud Allister); she's having a farewell sailing party with her female friends at a fancy hotel in New York. When she lays eyes on Wall Street tycoon Larry Day (Douglas Fairbanks) who is also at that same hotel for a dinner in his honor, Vivian wants to capture Larry and maybe even make him her own despite her engagement to Sir Horace. The next day she sails into Larry's office and although she doesn't make it too far initially, things do start to happen.

Larry, for all his financial success, knows next to nothing about women so his valet Roger (Edward Everett Horton) coaches him in some very funny scenes.
Eventually Larry is so interested in running after Vivian that he hops the ship to England she's taking with her father and friends in an attempt to woo her.

The plot can go anywhere from here. No spoilers--watch and find out!

There are, however, a few things that I do want to point out to you--Bing Crosby makes his earliest released film appearance in Reaching for the Moon although he only sings one quick song about 46 minutes into the picture. This film was also one of the very last film performances for Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.; he didn't a smooth transfer from silent movies to ""talkies"" probably because of his voice and his age limiting him to fewer and fewer acrobatic stunts. In addition, it's interesting to see how the stock market crash of 1929 is initially referred to as a ""panic;"" it's only later in the film that we see just how bad the market crash really was.

Reaching for the Moon is not bad; it's entertaining yet the plot is somewhat thin. At least the picture and sound quality are a bit better here than in the Passport DVD release of this film. I hope they find the missing footage! That would be an improvement. Despite its shortcomings, I recommend this movie for fans of the actors in it; musicals and people who enjoy early ""talkies.""",1370563200,2,2632,4.651612903225806
7896565,3,6305828482,"Douglas Fairbanks' second talkie (and first commercial failure) was this Depression-era romantic comedy. Seen today, ""Reaching for the Moon"" (1931) benefits from a lively cast, Doug's occasional acrobatics and William Cameron Menzies' stunning Art Deco sets. In his second film appearance, Bing Crosby croons Irving Berlin's ""When the Folks High-Up Do That Mean Low-Down."" An intriguing pre-Code curio. Unfortunately, the original 91-minute version has yet to resurface, with edited prints ranging from 62 to 74 minutes.",1346112000,,520,5.855263157894737
7896566,5,6305828482,"Reaching for the Moon has a touch of glamour and polish missing from many films made during the early days of talking pictures. While it seems slight compared to films made only a couple of years later, viewed within its time frame in film history, it is a quite enjoyable romantic comedy. Douglas Fairbanks may have been approaching fifty, but brings the same energy and panache he had displayed in his swashbuckling silent films.

Larry Day (Fairbanks) is a voracious tycoon stopped dead in his tracks by lovely Vivian Benton. Silent star Bebe Daniels stars as the already spoken for rich society girl taken with Larry. Edward Everett Horton is splendid as Larry's valet, coaching Larry on how to win her over when he's not checking out the honeys through his binoculars and studying how to get them. Horton would make a career out of roles similar to this one, most notably in the romantic musical comedies of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

Larry chases Vivian onboard the S.S. Lamerique ocean liner where a youthful Bing Crosby gets to croon a song by Irving Berlin, who wrote the original story. Director Edmund Goulding wrote the screenplay but it is the fabulous Art Deco sets of William Cameron Menzies and the photography of Ray June and Robert Planck which help this early talkie play better onscreen than it does on paper. Fairbanks shows his athletic prowess still remained even late in his career in a scene after drinking Horton's concoction meant to give him courage for romancing Vivian.

Some humorous moments and a nice ending will please fans of early talkies. Fans of Fairbanks and Daniels will probably enjoy this a great deal. Others may find Fairbanks a bit over the top, and his voice a bit tinny. This video print is very watchable, if unspectacular. Originally 91 minutes in length, available prints run just over an hour. It is not noticed but seems a shame as this is a charming little early sound film. Hopefully one day we will be able to see what has been lost, which might perhaps include another song from Bing.",1226361600,,2046,4.75774647887324
7896567,4,6305828482,"The end of the silent film era in 1929 ushered in a brand new style of motion picture along with rising new stars of the early sound era, and this 1931 production has the best of both worlds.  The story and music are by Irving Berlin, with a toe-tapping tune sung by a young and upcoming Bing Crosby, and direction is by Edmund Goulding who wrote and directed many films in the `30s and `40s.  The Art Deco sets are by William Cameron Menzies who already made a name for himself in the silent era, and the two lead parts are played by Douglas Fairbanks, Sr and Bebe Daniels, who had both been very popular stars since the mid-1910s.  All together, the mix is a charming, pleasant and enjoyable light romantic comedy which has all the flavours of its time, the early 1930s.  In fact, the story is set a year or two earlier, at the time of the 1929 Wall Street Crash, in which Fairbanks plays an exuberant `modern financial wizard' called Larry Day, and the equally charming Bebe Daniels is his hard-to-catch love interest.  Best remembered for his action-adventure box office hits such as Zorro, Robin Hood and The Three Musketeers in the 1920s, Fairbanks displays much the same dynamic persona and athleticism in ""Reaching for the Moon"", with his flair for drama carried over into his voice and speech for this, his second `talkie'.  Bebe also makes the transition to sound seamlessly with her natural, unaffected personality, while other talented actors like Edward Everett Horton, who plays Fairbanks' valet, add further spice to the mix and balance the variety of characters in this film.

Too busy making his millions on the share market, Larry Day had never been in love until he met Vivian, an accomplished aviatrix and independent woman of her time, who, despite being secretly engaged to a stuffy Englishman, decides to have some fun with Larry, betting with her friends that she could score a date with him.  But when she stands him up and leaves for England by ship that same evening, Larry follows her on impulse and tries to win her heart during the Atlantic cruise.  There are many light-hearted moments, especially when Larry's valet concocts an exotic cocktail which frees everyone of their inhibitions, but also some reminders of reality when the Wall Street Crash leaves Larry broke; as well as heartbroken.  ""Reaching for the Moon"" should find a place in the collection of early cinema enthusiasts, and it is also a lovely 1-hour escape from the modern world - even if the Wall Street events sound ominously familiar in current times.  This particular DVD by Synergy Entertainment has no bonus features, nor any scene selection, but the picture and sound quality are of quite a good standard, particularly considering the age of this film.",1225065600,7,2757,4.79535864978903
7896568,4,6305828482,"This is a charming and delightful comedy with flavours of early 1930s flair and Art Deco styles, Irving Berlin Jazz and echoes of the Wall Street Crash to add some solemn notes and depth.  It is a simple story about two successful and wealthy people who have given up on finding love, but a playful bet by one of them brings them together, though not without a few hiccups at first.
I bought this video mainly because I wanted to hear Douglas Fairbanks Sr in a ""talkie"", after having enjoyed his more famous swashbuckling films of the 1920s, and I was not at all disappointed.  He successfully transferred his silent charisma to speech, making his character, Larry Day, stand out from the crowd, and especially so when he executes his trademark acrobatics with grace and agility.
The leading lady, Bebe Daniels, is also a pleasure to watch, especially in a short duel with a young-looking Bing Crosby!
I'm sure this film would be a treat for anyone who enjoys 1930s films, or who always finds Douglas Fairbanks thoroughly entertaining, no matter which role or era.",1081555200,3,1064,4.745945945945946
