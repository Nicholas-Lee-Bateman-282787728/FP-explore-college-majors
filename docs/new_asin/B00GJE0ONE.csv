8623767,1,B00GJE0ONE,"After waiting over a month for the movie,I was very disappointed that it was even English language.. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone..I really like the movie but it's not in English.",1395705600,,186,4.84375
8623768,4,B00GJE0ONE,"A very campy movie, although I enjoyed it more that a number of others of the same ilk. Perhaps the Abominable Snowman genre is overpopulated, but I had fun this this (and conversely, it had fun with me).",1394582400,,204,4.394736842105263
8623769,3,B00GJE0ONE,"ANSWER: None. Formula from scene 1 through The End.  Once more SyFy goes through its checklist of A Movie Plot and doesn't miss a cliche. Even the summing-up speech of the heroine at the end is straight out of Movie Dialogue to Be Used in Monster Movies.  Why did I watch this?  Because Adrian Paul was in it, though he was wasted (no pun intended) as a helicopter pilot in disgrace because of a drunken accident.  He was barely in any scenes except for getting the ""rescue unit"" to and from the mountain.  As films go, I preferred him in The Fantastic Voyages of Sir Francis Drake (or whatever it was called) also done for SyFy but that's another movie, so...

The monsters are vague, barely distinguishable shapes in the snow, deliberately so I imagine, but deadly enough. One by one the rescue squad is picked off. At least there's a bit of emotion for one of the deceased.  It never amazes me how their companions can get killed off and no one ever shows any grief. Granted they're feeling for their lives but even in those little respites between mad sprints there's no mention of bereavement or regret.  Whatever...if I didn't have near-insomnia on some nights I'd miss all these SyFy gems. Aren't I the lucky one?",1391126400,,1220,4.564220183486238
8623770,2,B00GJE0ONE,"Pete gets killed in the first scene by a CG Abominable Snowman (AS). Brian (Chuck Campbell) who was out with him vows revenge as the AS also killed his father 25 years ago. Brian goes back up the mountain and never contacts anyone. His sister Nina (Lauren O'Neil) forms a rescue party of friends who are all either ex-military, current military who have a lot of time on their hands, and wannabe military. Mark (Adrian Paul) the finest drunk CG helicopter pilot, takes them on top of the mountain so we watch them ski and snow board where they need to go...over pristine mountain that already has tracks, go figure.

In wouldn't be much of a film if they didn't encounter a mess-o-Yeti.

This production takes place in Washington State, but filmed in Bulgaria. This SyFy production is well a SyFy production, so our monster lacks some credibility. The soundtrack is TV lame. One for the kids.

Fun Fact: They have done DNA testing on what people claim is Yeti hair from two separate sources. The DNA is that of a bear of an unknown species that could be a hybrid of the Grizzly and Polar Bear, or perhaps an ancient common ancestor not yet discovered.",1390003200,,1151,4.577669902912621
