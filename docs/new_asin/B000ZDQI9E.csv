3039220,5,B000ZDQI9E,"If you want to meet the real Charlie Wilson and the real exchanges that took place as he forstered the Afgan effort to drive the Russians out of of Afganistan, then you'll want to see the History Channels ""True Story"". It involves so much detail about how things get done in Washington and in Congress that if your like me you'll watch it over and over. This is no movie made up by Hollywood, but, except for some parts, it puts together documentary scenes with the protagonist himself, Congressman Charlie Wilson, telling story, how he got Congress to fund the weapons and supplies to the Afgans, how he made visits to the right world leaders to help instigate it, and without a lot of publicity.

One scene that the History Channel had that unfortunately did not get onto the DVD is the finale of the Russians, as they were leaving Afghanistan across freedom bridge, requested that Charlie show up in military uniform. Charlie thought the Russians were going to shoot him since he was not at that moment a civilian, but they wanted to salute the man who pulled off uniting a people who drove them out.

Unfortunately also, we never got hear Charlies views and efforts to overcome the Pakistani's who never could be trusted in the beginning and are doing everything they can today to support the middle-east terrorists following the Bin Laden cult, and of course to continue to be one of the 80 or so despot governments that now run the UN.",1211673600,21,1441,4.625

3039253,4,B000ZDQI9E,This is a great video that clarifies the role of Charlie Wilson and the years of combat between the Afghan people and the Soviets.  The repurcussions of that still reverberates in that part of the world.  Wilson was a maverick and championed the downtrodden but the US failed to follow up with aid to that part of the world once the Soviets left although Wilson attempted to orient congress in that direction.  Another case of too little and too late and soon we were involved in that area ourselves as a nation.  Truly a case of irony in action.,1306713600,,546,4.484848484848484
3039254,1,B000ZDQI9E,"This felt more like a propaganda piece or a political ad for Charlie Wilson than a decent documentary.

Joanne Herring, a described fervent anti-communist, was portraying facts of the war without any qualification. Charlie Wilson's entry into politics via emotional appeal and his social behavior while in office seemed to be portrayed more as a prank than as actual issues, even if irrelevant to the Afghan war.

Unfortunately, I can't give a complete review of the film, as I turned it off 30 minutes in.",1305331200,,506,4.9411764705882355
3039255,4,B000ZDQI9E,"When Henry Kissinger joined the Nixon administration, Daniel Ellsberg had a conversation with him about government secrets.

""Henry, you're about to get a lot of clearances higher than top secret that you did not know existed,"" said Daniel Ellsberg. ""That's going to have a sequence of effects on you. First, a great exhilaration, you're getting all this great information that you didn't know even existed. And then you feel like a fool for not having known any of this. But that won't last long. Very soon, you'll come to think that everyone else is foolish. What would this expert be telling me if he knew what I knew? So in the end you stop listening to them.""

I do not have access to the secret information that Ellsberg referred to, but I think I know why he felt foolish for not knowing the truth. Anyone who takes the story of Charlie Wilson at face value would probably feel extremely foolish after learning the truth. Again, I don't know the whole truth myself, but I can make a few guesses.

This documentary makes it seem like a boozing, womanizing congressman through sheer determination forced the U.S. government to help the Afghans defeat the Soviets. It makes it seem like, had Charlie Wilson not been there, we wouldn't have supported the Afghans properly and they would have lost. I can guarantee you that is not what happened.

Instead, the story of Charlie Wilson is what's called diplomatic kabuki. It's a form of theater. It's an elaborate negotiating strategy. To see this strategy in action, let's examine what happened when Charlie Wilson rear ended another car.

According to the documentary, Charlie Wilson needed to convince Clarence Long of the need to increase the funding for the Afghans. To do that, Wilson planned to take Representative Long to Paris on August 11, 1983. The night before, Wilson had nine Manhattans, got drunk, and hit another car on his way home. To avoid a DUI, he fled the scene. Once he got home, he telephoned his associates in Paris and told them what happened. That night, the police waited outside his apartment to arrest him. Eventually, his staff convinced the police to let him leave the country. Wilson went to Paris, Clarence Long decided to support the war, and Congress increased the assistance package by ten fold to $1 billion.

The documentary fails to mention what was going on in the rest of the world at that time. In Chad, a group of rebels backed by Libya were threatening to overthrow the current government, which America supported. Both the government of Chad and the U.S. government wanted France to send soldiers and aircraft to Chad to fight against the rebels. On August 7, France said it would not send soldiers or aircraft. Two days later, France reversed itself and said it would send 180 soldiers. Throughout the rest of the month, the French commitment to Chad continued to escalate until it committed 3,000 soldiers and 10 warplanes.

Two thousand miles to the northeast, in Lebanon, on August 10, the Druze started firing their artillery at the Lebanese army. The Lebanese Army returned fire. Some of the shelling hit the U.S. Marine peacekeeping force. A piece of shrapnel slightly wounded one Marine, Ailneal Morris. Robert C. McFarlane was visiting the Marine headquarters during the fighting. A rocket came within 500 yards of him. McFarlane promptly ended his visit. Lebanon has a long history with France. In the wake of World War I, France gained control of Lebanon as part of the French Mandate for Syria.

Of course, there may have been other issues that I'm not aware of, but let's examine these two issues and how they relate to Charlie Wilson. Here's my best guess as to what happened. America had been pressuring France to send more aid to Chad. France had been resisting. In an effort to fight back, France had either the Lebanese Army or the Druze fire a couple rounds at Robert C. McFarlane. This made America mad. America threatened to cancel the trip to Paris. Had America canceled the trip, the Afghans would not have gotten the aid. Presumably, France wanted America to give the Afghans that aid. In a series of last minute negotiations, France agreed to provide more help to Chad and America agreed to provide aid to the Afghans. The congressional delegation made its trip to France.

Again, what I've just outlined may not be right, but if it's not, something like that probably happened. Let's assume for the sake of argument that I'm right and let's examine the way in which France and America put pressure on each other. To put pressure on America, France had the Lebanese fire their artillery at the American military. Of course, France can't say, ""Hey, I'm pissed that you want us to send soldiers to Chad so I'm going to shoot a couple of rounds at you and injure one of your soldiers."" That could mean war. Instead, it had Lebanon fire those rounds while France could deny any involvement. Nevertheless, given the situation, America probably blamed France for what happened. But it couldn't prove anything. But it needed to respond. It responded by threatening to cancel the congressional trip to Paris. Of course, America could not say, ""You guys just fired artillery at our soldiers and wounded one of them. We're going to retaliate by not sending aid to the Afghans."" America couldn't say this because it had no proof. What it could do, though, was to have Charlie Wilson rear end another car on the Key Bridge. Then, it could have Wilson telephone Paris and say that the trip might not happen, not because of what happened in Lebanon, but because of a traffic accident. Now France had a choice. To save the trip, it would have to offer something to America. I imagine that France called the American government and told it that France would offer more support to the government of Chad. That probably satiated the American government. Upon hearing that, America probably informed the French government that the police would not arrest Charlie Wilson.",1292371200,3,5972,4.807205452775073
3039256,4,B000ZDQI9E,"The True Story of Charlie Wilson, 2007 film

""This program contains scenes that have been dramatized with special attention given to historical accuracy."" Drama is ordinary life with the dull parts edited out. The biggest operation in CIA history. ""Charlie Did It"". On July 27, 1980 Congressman Charlie Wilson saw ""60 Minutes"" about the Afghan war. He doubled their $5 million appropriation for Afghan rebels. The Soviet Army only intended to stay 5 or 6 months. [Really?] The people of Afghan resisted for their freedom (growing opium poppies). The CIA only supplied weapons that couldn't be traced back to the supplier. Their intent was to use the Afghans as an expendable annoyance. Teenager Charlie Wilson shuttled voters to the polls to defeat a neighbor in East Texas. [In 1945?] After serving in the Navy, he was elected to the state legislature. Then he ran for Congress as a selfless patriot. Elected, he hired ""Charlie's Angels"". Charlie supported the underdog. Charlie could increase appropriations without any vote!

The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan generated refugees who fled to Pakistan. [No mention of land reform.] Charlie met Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite with powerful connections. [Oil?] Charlie and others supported the Mujahadeen. The Russian soldiers were barbaric against the Afghan people. Small toys were mined as booby traps. The MI-24 `Hind' helicopter had no opposition. The Afghan leaders wanted better weapons. The CIA didn't want to escalate the war. An operations officer was assigned to Charlie. Support for the Afghans was aimed as payback for the Soviet support for the Vietnamese. In 1983 there was a report on Charlie's drug use. ""Cocaine Charlie."" Charlie went to Egypt, they had warehouses of Soviet-made arms. Could a modern-day belly dancer be as effective as `Mata Hari'? Excitement? Note the differences in culture between Egypt and Pakistan. The Khyber Pass links Pakistan to Afghanistan, it was used by refugees and for arms transportation.

Could Charlie escape a criminal investigation? Yes, a Playboy model testified to clear him in an adroit fashion. [Was a deal made?] They needed another Congressman to help with the funding. The film explains how this was engineered. A DUI and hit-and-run wasn't a problem for Charlie. They gave Doc Long special treatment in Paris, and a show in Pakistan. It worked! The CIA became more involved in supplying arms like anti-tank weapons and mines. A terrorist attack on a gas station in Washington? But what if he lost the election? How did he win against the odds? The Afghans needed a weapon against the MI-24 helicopter, a ""flying tank"", like the `Stinger' SAM missile. In 1985 Charlie developed heart problems. [Whiskey?] Then President Reagan chose to overrule everyone's advice and supply `Stingers' to the Afghan rebels. These missiles worked as designed. This changed the war. The new leader Gorbachev set a time limit to win or withdraw' they did the latter.

This was followed by the end of the Cold War and great political changes. Charlie Wilson was given an award. Was the 9/11/2001 attack an unforeseen consequence of the rebel triumph in Afghanistan? The Taliban and Al Qaida came to power there. How was the powerful Soviet Army defeated? ""Charlie did it."" But this simple answer overlooks a lot of other events that were going on at the same time. Machiavelli wrote about the politics where an ally is built up to oppose a common enemy. The end of the alliance can lead to diverging interests. The British fought two wars around 1877-1880 to gain control of the opium trade and its profits. Will another country waste men and money to try to conquer Afghanistan? Was there an increase in opium and heroin since 1990? Who benefits?",1290470400,,3753,5.077795786061588

But then the presentation doesn't really need it.  The real life Charlie Wilson's Afghanistan adventure makes for a wild story, complete with high class 'socialites' determining the fate of nations, party-boy politicians, drug use scandals, illegal arms smuggling operations, and the lives of millions on the line - at least the Afghans wanted Wilson's help (and that makes a big difference for me), and whatever has followed since, he definitely delivered, in his own unique way.

3273750,4,B000ZDQI9E,This is a great video that clarifies the role of Charlie Wilson and the years of combat between the Afghan people and the Soviets.  The repurcussions of that still reverberates in that part of the world.  Wilson was a maverick and championed the downtrodden but the US failed to follow up with aid to that part of the world once the Soviets left although Wilson attempted to orient congress in that direction.  Another case of too little and too late and soon we were involved in that area ourselves as a nation.  Truly a case of irony in action.,1306713600,,546,4.484848484848484
3273751,1,B000ZDQI9E,"This felt more like a propaganda piece or a political ad for Charlie Wilson than a decent documentary.

Joanne Herring, a described fervent anti-communist, was portraying facts of the war without any qualification. Charlie Wilson's entry into politics via emotional appeal and his social behavior while in office seemed to be portrayed more as a prank than as actual issues, even if irrelevant to the Afghan war.

Unfortunately, I can't give a complete review of the film, as I turned it off 30 minutes in.",1305331200,,506,4.9411764705882355
3273752,4,B000ZDQI9E,"When Henry Kissinger joined the Nixon administration, Daniel Ellsberg had a conversation with him about government secrets.

""Henry, you're about to get a lot of clearances higher than top secret that you did not know existed,"" said Daniel Ellsberg. ""That's going to have a sequence of effects on you. First, a great exhilaration, you're getting all this great information that you didn't know even existed. And then you feel like a fool for not having known any of this. But that won't last long. Very soon, you'll come to think that everyone else is foolish. What would this expert be telling me if he knew what I knew? So in the end you stop listening to them.""

I do not have access to the secret information that Ellsberg referred to, but I think I know why he felt foolish for not knowing the truth. Anyone who takes the story of Charlie Wilson at face value would probably feel extremely foolish after learning the truth. Again, I don't know the whole truth myself, but I can make a few guesses.

This documentary makes it seem like a boozing, womanizing congressman through sheer determination forced the U.S. government to help the Afghans defeat the Soviets. It makes it seem like, had Charlie Wilson not been there, we wouldn't have supported the Afghans properly and they would have lost. I can guarantee you that is not what happened.

Instead, the story of Charlie Wilson is what's called diplomatic kabuki. It's a form of theater. It's an elaborate negotiating strategy. To see this strategy in action, let's examine what happened when Charlie Wilson rear ended another car.

According to the documentary, Charlie Wilson needed to convince Clarence Long of the need to increase the funding for the Afghans. To do that, Wilson planned to take Representative Long to Paris on August 11, 1983. The night before, Wilson had nine Manhattans, got drunk, and hit another car on his way home. To avoid a DUI, he fled the scene. Once he got home, he telephoned his associates in Paris and told them what happened. That night, the police waited outside his apartment to arrest him. Eventually, his staff convinced the police to let him leave the country. Wilson went to Paris, Clarence Long decided to support the war, and Congress increased the assistance package by ten fold to $1 billion.

The documentary fails to mention what was going on in the rest of the world at that time. In Chad, a group of rebels backed by Libya were threatening to overthrow the current government, which America supported. Both the government of Chad and the U.S. government wanted France to send soldiers and aircraft to Chad to fight against the rebels. On August 7, France said it would not send soldiers or aircraft. Two days later, France reversed itself and said it would send 180 soldiers. Throughout the rest of the month, the French commitment to Chad continued to escalate until it committed 3,000 soldiers and 10 warplanes.

Two thousand miles to the northeast, in Lebanon, on August 10, the Druze started firing their artillery at the Lebanese army. The Lebanese Army returned fire. Some of the shelling hit the U.S. Marine peacekeeping force. A piece of shrapnel slightly wounded one Marine, Ailneal Morris. Robert C. McFarlane was visiting the Marine headquarters during the fighting. A rocket came within 500 yards of him. McFarlane promptly ended his visit. Lebanon has a long history with France. In the wake of World War I, France gained control of Lebanon as part of the French Mandate for Syria.

Of course, there may have been other issues that I'm not aware of, but let's examine these two issues and how they relate to Charlie Wilson. Here's my best guess as to what happened. America had been pressuring France to send more aid to Chad. France had been resisting. In an effort to fight back, France had either the Lebanese Army or the Druze fire a couple rounds at Robert C. McFarlane. This made America mad. America threatened to cancel the trip to Paris. Had America canceled the trip, the Afghans would not have gotten the aid. Presumably, France wanted America to give the Afghans that aid. In a series of last minute negotiations, France agreed to provide more help to Chad and America agreed to provide aid to the Afghans. The congressional delegation made its trip to France.

Again, what I've just outlined may not be right, but if it's not, something like that probably happened. Let's assume for the sake of argument that I'm right and let's examine the way in which France and America put pressure on each other. To put pressure on America, France had the Lebanese fire their artillery at the American military. Of course, France can't say, ""Hey, I'm pissed that you want us to send soldiers to Chad so I'm going to shoot a couple of rounds at you and injure one of your soldiers."" That could mean war. Instead, it had Lebanon fire those rounds while France could deny any involvement. Nevertheless, given the situation, America probably blamed France for what happened. But it couldn't prove anything. But it needed to respond. It responded by threatening to cancel the congressional trip to Paris. Of course, America could not say, ""You guys just fired artillery at our soldiers and wounded one of them. We're going to retaliate by not sending aid to the Afghans."" America couldn't say this because it had no proof. What it could do, though, was to have Charlie Wilson rear end another car on the Key Bridge. Then, it could have Wilson telephone Paris and say that the trip might not happen, not because of what happened in Lebanon, but because of a traffic accident. Now France had a choice. To save the trip, it would have to offer something to America. I imagine that France called the American government and told it that France would offer more support to the government of Chad. That probably satiated the American government. Upon hearing that, America probably informed the French government that the police would not arrest Charlie Wilson.",1292371200,3,5972,4.807205452775073
3273753,4,B000ZDQI9E,"The True Story of Charlie Wilson, 2007 film

""This program contains scenes that have been dramatized with special attention given to historical accuracy."" Drama is ordinary life with the dull parts edited out. The biggest operation in CIA history. ""Charlie Did It"". On July 27, 1980 Congressman Charlie Wilson saw ""60 Minutes"" about the Afghan war. He doubled their $5 million appropriation for Afghan rebels. The Soviet Army only intended to stay 5 or 6 months. [Really?] The people of Afghan resisted for their freedom (growing opium poppies). The CIA only supplied weapons that couldn't be traced back to the supplier. Their intent was to use the Afghans as an expendable annoyance. Teenager Charlie Wilson shuttled voters to the polls to defeat a neighbor in East Texas. [In 1945?] After serving in the Navy, he was elected to the state legislature. Then he ran for Congress as a selfless patriot. Elected, he hired ""Charlie's Angels"". Charlie supported the underdog. Charlie could increase appropriations without any vote!

The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan generated refugees who fled to Pakistan. [No mention of land reform.] Charlie met Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite with powerful connections. [Oil?] Charlie and others supported the Mujahadeen. The Russian soldiers were barbaric against the Afghan people. Small toys were mined as booby traps. The MI-24 `Hind' helicopter had no opposition. The Afghan leaders wanted better weapons. The CIA didn't want to escalate the war. An operations officer was assigned to Charlie. Support for the Afghans was aimed as payback for the Soviet support for the Vietnamese. In 1983 there was a report on Charlie's drug use. ""Cocaine Charlie."" Charlie went to Egypt, they had warehouses of Soviet-made arms. Could a modern-day belly dancer be as effective as `Mata Hari'? Excitement? Note the differences in culture between Egypt and Pakistan. The Khyber Pass links Pakistan to Afghanistan, it was used by refugees and for arms transportation.

Could Charlie escape a criminal investigation? Yes, a Playboy model testified to clear him in an adroit fashion. [Was a deal made?] They needed another Congressman to help with the funding. The film explains how this was engineered. A DUI and hit-and-run wasn't a problem for Charlie. They gave Doc Long special treatment in Paris, and a show in Pakistan. It worked! The CIA became more involved in supplying arms like anti-tank weapons and mines. A terrorist attack on a gas station in Washington? But what if he lost the election? How did he win against the odds? The Afghans needed a weapon against the MI-24 helicopter, a ""flying tank"", like the `Stinger' SAM missile. In 1985 Charlie developed heart problems. [Whiskey?] Then President Reagan chose to overrule everyone's advice and supply `Stingers' to the Afghan rebels. These missiles worked as designed. This changed the war. The new leader Gorbachev set a time limit to win or withdraw' they did the latter.

This was followed by the end of the Cold War and great political changes. Charlie Wilson was given an award. Was the 9/11/2001 attack an unforeseen consequence of the rebel triumph in Afghanistan? The Taliban and Al Qaida came to power there. How was the powerful Soviet Army defeated? ""Charlie did it."" But this simple answer overlooks a lot of other events that were going on at the same time. Machiavelli wrote about the politics where an ally is built up to oppose a common enemy. The end of the alliance can lead to diverging interests. The British fought two wars around 1877-1880 to gain control of the opium trade and its profits. Will another country waste men and money to try to conquer Afghanistan? Was there an increase in opium and heroin since 1990? Who benefits?",1290470400,,3753,5.077795786061588

It is only after about the half way point that it goes into greater detail about what really happened, and even still it offers only a bare bones sketch compared to the book.  While I do think the documentary is interesting and worthwhile, I would recommend it as a companion to the movie and book, as I do not think it is strong enough on its own merits.",1246665600,11,629,4.589285714285714

The real life Charlie Wilson's Afghanistan adventure makes for a wild story, complete with high class 'socialites' determining the fate of nations, party-boy politicians, drug use scandals, illegal arms smuggling operations, and the lives of millions on the line - at least the Afghans wanted Wilson's help (and that makes a big difference for me), and whatever has followed since, he definitely delivered, in his own unique way.
