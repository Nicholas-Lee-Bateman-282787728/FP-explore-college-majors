7970879,1,B00006JU6X,"Not even a grade ""C"" movie... Bad acting, filmography ok, plot ok, but very early Sharon stone... Limited range. Poor male acting",1368835200,,129,4.909090909090909
7970880,1,B00006JU6X,"The only reason to watch this low budget action flick is to see a young Sharon Stone, the movie itself is so pathetically inept I'm sure Sharon would like to delete this clunker from her resume, the screenplay and dialogue are so bad as to make one think a teenager made it up and the action scenes are mediocre too. If you want to see Sharon looking her best then give this one a look otherwise your 90 minutes can surely be put to better use.",1328486400,,444,4.174418604651163
7970881,3,B00006JU6X,"On Christmas Eve, Los Angeles police officer Johnny Modine's (The late Brad Davis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Express/dp/B000ZM1MGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Express</a>) father is brutally killed by ruthless cutthroat (Jonathan Banks,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pin/dp/B000059PP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pin</a>) and his two goons, played by Adam Ant (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slam-Dance/dp/B00008R9KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slam Dance</a>) and Sy Richardson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tripwire/dp/6301606906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tripwire</a>). As it turns out, the murder of Modine's father was part of a plan of revenge towards Modine for causing the killer to lose his voice and having to use an electronic talk box. On behalf of this, Modine is willing to risk his career and sanity to bring the killer down and avenge his father's death. Along the way, Modine is eventually taken off the case by his captain and meets the luring Kathy Connors (Sharon Stone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall/dp/B00070FX5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall</a>), who hides a secret connection of her own to both the killer and Modine.

I first saw the film on television when I was 14. I felt the exact way about the film then, and I sure as heck feel the same way about it now having watched it on DVD at the age of 21.

Recommended.

7970882,4,B00006JU6X,"I bought this becuase it was cheap and was an Adam Any movie. While not the main character, he plays his part as bad guy extrordinaire. Sharon Stone is also very good in this early role for her and looks hot... Not the greatest story line but like I said, it was bought becuase I'm his biggest fan.",1022544000,,298,4.155172413793103

He made a wonderful bad guy, but if you like the average cop movie, here ya go!",1010793600,,208,3.9761904761904763
