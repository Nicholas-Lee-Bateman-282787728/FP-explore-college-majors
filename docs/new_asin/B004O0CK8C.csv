8436920,5,B004O0CK8C,"I've watched this documentary program four times already over the past 6 years, always as an item from Inter-Library Loan.  It's one of the best science documentaries of all time, from any culture, globally.  I also listen regularly to British science radio-program podcasts by many of these same scientists/broadcasters (BBC Radio 4 -- visit their podcasts portal page).  Some of these BBC Radio 4 scientists/broadcasters I first encountered in this DVD set, 6 years ago, have become beloved 'podcast teachers' for me, increasing my quality-of-life.  This documentary is a ""must-see"" if you love learning both the history of science AND about many different fields of scientific discovery and invention.  Check it out from your library, or purchase it, and you'll be glad you did!  There's a ""completely separate & unrelated"" bonus disk also in this set, which features Stephen Hawking!",1465344000,,887,5.3
8436921,5,B004O0CK8C,"A group of current science leaders of the UK take a look at some of their favorite past scientists and their achievements in ""Genius of Britain."" Some were so surprising that I had to do an internet search to verify that the beginning was indeed from the UK. All I check proved true. This was a fascinating trip through 4 centuries of science. Well presented with plenty of old and new footage, stills, drawings, and computer enhancements. Not just lecture, but an engaging documentary of historical facts that surprise and educate. What a fun way to visit highlights of science and history at the same time.

SUBTITLES available for all episodes, each about 50 minutes.
1 THE FIRST FIVE
17th century London begins with the varied interests of London architect/rebuilder Christopher Wren, the 1664 comet, war corpses dissected and parts drawn in detail. Nest is Robert Hooke's microscopic world of the compound microscope, followed by Robert Boyle's air pump (with Hooke's help) and observed vacuum. Moving on we see Isaac Newton, his math and gravity; ending with Edmond Halley's adventures on the sea and S. Hem. star map.

2 ROOMFUL OF BRILLIANT MINDS
Each presenter picked an 18th century scientist from a Victorian group picture. Sir Joseph Banks, botanist, traveled with Capt. Cook to Tahiti in 1768-71 & largely was responsible for Kew Gardens. James Watt, perfected the steam power igniting the British Industrial Revolution. Surgeon John Hunter was the father of modern surgery and Edward Jenner provided smallpox immunity from cowpox. Smallpox is now extinct. Henry Cavendish found hydrogen in 1766, a lead-in to flight, and clergyman Joseph Priestley, Cavendish's friend, was responsible for carbon dioxide which led to soda pop and oxygen.

3 THE LIGHTS COME ON
A 19TH century look begins with an apprentice bookbinder, Michael Faraday, and his electric study which included the 1st electric lighthouse, an elec. Mother and a dynamo. Alfred Russel Wallace, paralleled Darwin in the theory of evolution, but much of Wallace's study in the Amazon was lost by a ship fire/sinking, otherwise he might have beat Darwin for the claim to fame. Isambard Kingdom Brunel built bridges, railroading, and ships-bigger is better. His largest would lay the transatlantic telegraph cable, which was helped into the world through thermodynamic studies of Wm. Thompson (Lord Kelvin). James Cleck Maxwell gave us electromagnetic theory equations and the speed of light.

4 OUT OF THE DARKNESS
Wars gave the 20th century new science for the future. Robert Watson-Watt's advance was radar; Alan Turning, a war code breaker lead to computer science; and Frank Whittle surprised everyone with the jet engine. All good peaceful items as well as war tools. Also presented are Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin discovery; and Paul Dirac combining relativity with quantum mechanics, which to laymen means electronics of the future.

5 ASKING BIG QUESTIONS
Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins all had their hand in the double-helix structure of DNA (attributed to Watson-Crick). Fred Hoyle coined ""Big Bang"" and continuous creation. Carbon nanotubes may be today's sci-fi turned reality, and the scientific world continues to ask question, today unanswerable, but maybe solved in an inspirational moment at any time.

Excellent for any science shelf, be it at home or in an educational setting.
This includes a variety of BONUS extras, not the least of which is an entire 90 minute DVD, ""STEPHEN HAWKING AND THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING"". Hawking was one of the presenters in 'Genius of Britain'; and is world renown for his science search for creation's beginning. This DVDs 2-parts provide an amazing look at what is known and questions that remain unanswered. You'll not find the answer to creation. But you will hear about theories, what seems probable, and what is simply unknown. Very interesting, but as it is for all physicists, it's inconclusive--as yet!

A DVD set packed with science, historical information, and eye-appealing education.
An enjoyable way to learn. Truly worthy for middle elementary age to the scientifically elite. I'm near the beginning, at age 63, but found it compelling.",1302134400,12,4225,5.231905465288035
