8182247,3,B000NWQYYQ,"This is a performance magician's instructional video teaching the  levitaion illusion.  Basically how to hide the ball of one foot so it

appears you are levitating from a particular angle, with a few other psychological gimmics thrown in to aid in the illusion.  Nothing mystical,

just a ""How to Perform a Levitation Trick"" for an aspiring stage magician.  3 stars because I'm not a student, magician.  One viewing was sufficient for the merely curious.",1179705600,,455,5.0675675675675675
