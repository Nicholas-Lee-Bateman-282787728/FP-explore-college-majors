209346,2,6300147789,"This movie ranks at the top of my Golden Turkey list, right along with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". It is so-o-o bad it is actually good. Like many other bad movies, it was mocked and scorned by the guys on  Mystery Science Theater 3000, and is still being watched and traded by the  diehard fans. If you were to (purposely) get one bad movie this year, make  it Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. It's a laugh a minute.",930009600,3,418,4.265822784810126

This holiday turkey is unintentionally  entertaining, and features the yuletide favorite ""Hooray for Santy  Claus"" -- twice!  Plot line: Martian kids watch too much Earth T.V.  and are turned into emotionless zombies (No kidding!) The Martians shanghai  Saint Nick and two kids from New Jersey.  The kids want to back to earth  (but not to New Jersey) and Santa needs to get home, too.  Things seem to  go downhill for the aliens after Jamie Farr slobbers like a hammy doberman,  but Droppo saves the day!  See it, sez Garg!",916617600,3,697,5.070796460176991

209423,4,6300147789,"Takes me back to my childhood when I watched every sci fi, fantasy, and horror film I could find on TV (especially those shown on late night, which my mother said was ok as long as my grades didn't slip LOL).  A number of those films were great, well done movies and others were low budget but great fun to watch.  This one is one of the hilariously fun low budget films. Watch it to learn about early 60s ideas about everything from the proper behavior of girls and boys to responses to UFOs.  Watch this, then go see some of the original Star Trek series episodes for a good comparison between the usual attitudes and how progressive Roddenberry's ideas actually were in context. Watch this for a funny departure from the usual Christmas romance movie or more serious Christmas films.

209458,5,6300147789,"To begin with, this is not the worse movie ever made. It's not even the worse movie ever made about Santa Claus. Remember ""Santa Claus and the Ice Cream Bunny?"" The entire film was shot inside an aircraft hangar in Long Island, giving it a studio feel. It resembles nothing much as a Christmas play caught on film. The production values are roughly on the level of an early ""Doctor Who"" episode. The cast was drawn largely from Broadway. Aside from Bill McCutcheon as the supposedly lovable Martian Dropo (I want to punch him in the face so bad!) the acting is for the most part professional. John Call is a great Santa Claus, and I didn't find his laugh disturbing (if you want creepy laughter, check out the new Colonel Sanders!) Leonard Hick plays the Martian leader like a low-rent Charlton Heston, and Leila Martin is sexy as his wife (check out that Martian miniskirt!) Victor Stiles and Donna Conforti are appealing as the two earth children kidnapped by the Martians. Last but not least is Milton DeLugg's irresistible theme song ""Hooray for Santa Claus""--annoying but undeniably catchy, with a really cool trumpet solo. At least this movie won't teach your kids to smoke (though Santa does smoke a pipe in one scene), encourage them to experiment with drugs or sex, or turn them into serial killers.",1482451200,,1308,4.741228070175438
209459,5,6300147789,"Have to admit this is a guilty favorite of mine. I saw this when I was probably 7 or 8 years old on TV. The wackiest Christmas movie you will ever watch. It probably originated as a matinee movie for kids in the 60's or early 70's. Don't know if you'd call it a B movie or maybe even a C or D. I see one person wrote a review that the Santa was weird. I actually think he is the closest version of a Santa ever, that would match the jovial personality and demeanor of the real Santa. At least in my warped mind. Get ready for spine tingling special effects. (That's a joke) but the plot itself isn't all that bad. The Martians have no Santa and the Martian children are monitoring earth TV transmissions about Santa, wishing he would come there. So some Martians travel to Earth to kidnap Santa and bring him back to Mars to serve their children. Some humorous moments in the film that adults may appreciate. Like what happens when they send a Martian robot to get Santa and the Martians preferred food supply. I like how the Martians solve their Santa problem on Mars at the end by recruiting a nutty misfit Martian to become the Martian Santa. I don't know how kids today would respond to this movie. Back in the 60's they probably loved it. Anyway, if you get a kick out of watching old B movies, this might be entertaining for you and maybe your younger children.",1481500800,,1367,4.3023255813953485

209508,5,6300147789,"If you have never seen this film and have no idea about the story-line, but are intrigued by the title, it's easy enough to get some background from the film with a web search. If you *have* seen 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians' (SCCM) then there is a fair chance the you remember, at the very least, fragmented images of the Jolly One interacting with green-skinned people with 1960's 'futuristics' sets, props and costumes. If you have not seen the film and do a search, be advised that there are lots of harsh reviews of this film on the internet. Take these with a grain of salt. They seem to be written by individuals who do not seem to understand that -- however goofy the premise, acting, props, etc might seem to us now -- SCCM is a fairly typical science-fiction-themed novelty film of the early 1960's. (If you want to get a sense of what flim-making this era was like, watch 'Matinee' (1993) with John Goodman.) 'Exploitation' films in general are conceived and executed with virtually no concern for their 'shelf life'. Consequently, time is seldom kind. What sets SCCM apart from its many peers that have settled into comfortable (and sometimes justifiable) obscurity is the presence of The Big Man, making SCCM a 'holiday' film. Holiday movies have a life of their own. Many of the most notable contributions to the holiday film genre -- 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'A Christmas Story' -- have been low-budget affairs that, *because* they were holiday films have exhibited exceptional longevity for what are, in the parlance, 'B' movies. While not nearly as clever or artistic as the films mentioned, the fact that SCCM is one a very small number of 'sci fi holiday' films has allowed it to live on and, amazingly, receive a digital remastering. SCCM has it's own special charms, which are, admittedly, not for everyone, but if you are a fan of the Jolly One, 60's sci-fi, or just looking to add an obscure 'holiday' film to your collection, SCCM might just be worth the price of admission.",1460764800,2,2004,4.728571428571429

209511,1,6300147789,"Tl;dr review: Is it ""so bad, it's good""? No, it's just bad.

Full review: First off, I need to point out that I'm reviewing the movie and not the DVD, since I don't own it. I have this instead:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sci-Fi-Classics-50-Movie-Pack/dp/B0001HAGU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack</a>

This 50 movie megaset put no effort into cleaning up the sound and picture quality of the decayed versions of the movies they acquired, so this could be playing a factor in my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of the movie. The set does contain the full 81 minute version of the film, though.

The acting is not quite horrible - I've actually seen worse. The only name I recognize is Pia Zadora. In this film, she's 8, and not a reason to watch the movie. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about - for me, John Call's portrayal of Santa isn't that weird; he's the most believable character in the movie. He acts more or less the way you'd expect Santa to act in a children's movie.

Whether or not a movie qualifies for the ""so bad, it's good"" category is of course subjective. In my opinion, Ed Wood's ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" fit this category, but his ""Night of the Ghouls"" doesn't. ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is simply bad.

It is possible to create a children's movie that even adults can enjoy. This movie is not such a movie. Can even a single modern 5-year-old be found that would enjoy this? This movie frequently occurs on ""worst movie ever made"" lists, and it's easy to see why.
The theme song ""Hooray for Santy Claus"" - was apparently sang by Pia Zadora. (Very annoying song.) (Later as an adult, she did get nominated for a Grammy.)
There are people who enjoy watching bad movies. For you folks, I give this movie my strongest recommendation.

Now I suppose I should get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, after I
take a couple of months to recover:

Yes, its from a 16mm print and not in the best shape for a Public Domain film, but looks pretty good for what it is and thankfully not DNR'd like the 1st 1939 Gulliver's Travels Blu-ray. I am aware there was an earlier version of this release (the one without a Horizon Movies logo on the cover) that was recalled because it used a shorter 69min version, as opposed the 81 min runtime presented here. That version seems to be discontinued and asks 6x higher prices than the current pressings, but its said the current Horizon DVD uses the recalled shorter version because everyone bought the BD and noticed, but not the DVD released around the same time in 2012.

Another reviewer said that he loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Santa-Claus-Conquers-The-Martians/dp/B009510BMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Santa Claus Conquers The Martians</a>&nbsp;but also called it a a ""deservedly one-star movie."" I disagree with his reasoning. If you love a movie, you should give it 3, 4 or 5 stars depending on how much YOU love it. You should not look at what you think the average person would say it deserves.

When I watch a movie and decide how to rate it, I don't look at what I think other reviewers would say it deserves, but on my own attitude toward it. If I enjoy a movie so much that I know that I'll watch it again, and again, and maybe even again and again, then I'm going to give it five stars. If I know that I'll watch it again, but don't know if I'll watch it a third or fourth time, I'll give it either four or five stars, sometimes three, depending on my emotions.

If I can't even finish a movie, quit watching it in the middle, and know that I'll never watch it again, then I give it one star. If I finish a movie, but wish that I had not wasted two hours of my life on the movie, I'll also give it one star.

If I finish a movie, and got at least some enjoyment out of it, then I decide between two-to-four stars, and sometimes five, for it, depending on my feelings for the movie, and for how much I'd want to recommend the movie to my friends and family.

IMHO, our ratings are supposed to be our opinions, based on how we feel about a movie, not about how we think other people feel about a movie, so though I know that some people say that a movie is deservedly or obviously a particular rating, I will make my own opinion based on how I feel after watching it.

======================================
NOW FOR MY REVIEW BASED ON MY FEELINGS
======================================

This movie came out when I was 13 years old, but I had to wait a few years to see it because by the time we got to the theater, they'd substituted a different movie. Even though I was 13, I remember crying in disappointment.

The special effects are terrible, but the story is great. The martian makeup is equally terrible, but the motivations of the characters are clear. Remember, this is a low-budget movie of the 1960's. You cannot expect the special effects and makeup to match the high-budget movies of the 1990's and later.

If you can look beyond the special effects and the makeup, and just watch the movie, and imagine it as you'd film it, you'll enjoy this film. Put it on your list for next Christmas.

I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Christmas movies, especially if you can get it for not extra charge as part of you Amazon Prime membership, or a similar membership in another video service.",1393459200,2,2822,4.637274549098197

209762,3,6300147789,"It's a film that has been voted as ""one of the worst films ever made"" and it's also a film that has its fans because of its unusual sci-fi nature and that film is ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".

Released back in 1964, the film is based on a story written by Paul L. Jacobson and is directed by Nicholas Webster (""Gone are the Days!"", ""Mission Mars"") and a screenplay by Glenville Mareth.

The film would star John Call (""The Anderson Tapes"", ""Hangman's Knot"", ""Fearless Fagan""), Leonard Hicks (""Route 66), Vincent Beck (""Vigilante"", ""...And Justice For All"") and would be the film debut for actress Pia Zadora (""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult"", ""Hairspray"", ""The Lonely Lady"").

While the film was lauded for just being bad, it would gain in popularity after being featured in an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the '90s and since then, the film would be shown on Comedy Central since 1991 and also featured on ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"".

And now, the film has been remastered for a Blu-ray release courtesy of Horizon Movies and was released in December 2012.

VIDEO:

""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is presented in 1:33:1 and while the film probably looks its best on Blu-ray, one should not think of this film to be pristine.  The intro has some flickering and it's important to note that on the rear of the package, the following message is featured:  Due to teh rarity of materials available, the master for this film was created from a 16 mm European print secured by Holland Releasing with the HD telecine and color correction completed by Fotokem/Burbank.  Since this print was originally created for television, it is presented in a 1:33:1 aspect ratio.  The original theatrical release of this film was projected in a matted 1:85:1 with a safe top and bottom.  As a result of the master having ""removed the matte"", this presentation of the film actually reveals additional information on the top and bottom of the frame.

The film somewhat shows its age and is a bit soft, but it actually looks very good thanks to it being remastered in HD.  I didn't notice any compression problems at all.  But picture quality does show the unbalance of makeup during that time (which was evident in the HD releases of the ""Star Trek"" television series on Blu-ray) but while not pristine, its the best that ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" will probably ever look.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""is presented in DTS-HD monaural.  It does have its issues with it not being cleaned up but for those who love listening to ""Hooray for Santy Claus"" (sung by Pia Zadorra and other children) during the intro, this is the best you'll hear of this song.  Also, dialogue is understandable.  Just don't expect a clean lossless audio track as you will hear a bit of hiss and crackle.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" come with the following special features:

  Santa's Cool Holiday Film Festival - (46:17) Featuring many Christmas clips, animated shorts, commercials from the 1950s-1960s featuring the Nelsons, Shari Lewis and Lambchop and more.  These are not separate and must be watched as a full featurette.
  Trailer - (1:57) A newer trailer for ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".
  Stills Gallery - Featuring eight stills that can be viewed via your Blu-ray remote (or mouse/keyboard).

JUDGMENT CALL:

While ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" will be seen as one of the worst films of all time, for science fiction fans, it's one of those films that people who believe in ""it's so bad, it's good"" will probably enjoy this film.

The whole premise of martians going to Earth to kidnap Santa Claus and bring him to Mars is really far out and makes you wonder if the writer was on some drug, but watching it today, you can't help but enjoy it because it's so bad.

You have a martian race who all wear these ugly green outfits, children on Mars who watch American television and martians who speak English.  You have your idiot martian and as for Santa Claus, I don't know about how others have felt over the years, but when I first watched this film, I felt Santa was a bit creepy.

And this film's not going to win over sci-fans because costume design is terrible, makeup is not applied all that well (and the Blu-ray release makes these problems even more visible), special effects and set design is not all that great.  But once again, this film has earned its reputation for being bad, but yet there are a legion of fans who need their fix on ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" because its bad.  People who grew up with this film as they have grown up with other annual Christmas favorites such as ""A Christmas Story"", ""Home Alone"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but instead of being a really good film, it's more of watching this film because it's so kitschy but so far out, that it makes you think if Glenville Mareth or Paul L. Jacobson were on drugs while creating this film.

But to this day, I still watch this film when it airs on television and now watching on Blu-ray, this time watching it with my 9-year-old and he found it to be amusing and entertaining.

As for the Blu-ray release, this is probably the best one is going to see of this film.  While the picture quality and lossless track is not pristine, it still benefits from its remastering.  So, for those hanging on to those old VHS tapes recorded from TV, go ahead and throw those away and get this Blu-ray instead.  Also, for those who are nostalgic or are curious of older Christmas commercials or shorts, you get 46 minutes of classic Christmas clips from the '50s and '60s also included on this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is known to be a bad film but I have seen way worse films than this and dare I say, I'm always entertained by this film because of its far-out nature.  But for parents, this is probably a holiday film that you want to show your young children as they won't question the low production values or its crazy storyline.

And the film is enjoyed  by its fans because it has become this annual Christmas favorite for some because of its Christmas sci-fi nature and uber-kitschiness.  So, for those who grew up watching this film will probably want to own it on Blu-ray.  If you are a fan of the film, this Blu-ray is for you!",1364601600,3,6321,4.672694394213382

I wish i was a more technical person so i could give a more in-depth review of this disc, but believe me when i say not to wast your $20 buying this Blu-ray release, instead go and buy another Christmas movie called ""Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale"" 2 disc version on Blu-ray.

209794,3,6300147789,"The man in the red suit doesn't even spout a single ""Ho, ho, ho.""  The actors act like they'd rather be doing anything but this movie.

(And none of those guys saw one red cent of royalties, I'm guessing, but since the movie probably only broke even sometime last week, who's complaining...)  There's virtually no difference between the sound stage  backdrops for the North Pole and the sound stage backdrops for the caves of Mars. And to top it off, the movie ends with one of the most blatant Three Stooges ripoff sequence ever committed on film. This is one of the cheesiest movies ever made and well deserving of it's ranking on the list of the worst movies ever made.

But still, it's a lot of fun to watch.  If you can enjoy laughing at the ridiculousness of a movie like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", you will like this one too.  Most of these people never acted in another feature film again and that goes for Pia Zadora, too, unless you call what she does on screen ""acting"".)

209800,5,6300147789,"SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS, a 1964 low-budget Christmas movie, is a lot of fun to watch! The plot is simple: Martian leader Kimar spearheads a mission to bring Santa Claus to Mars in order to cheer up the Martian children. Santa, along with two Earth children, arrive and bring a sense of fun to the Martians, both adult and children, much to the consternation of Voldar (a Martian fundamentalist who thinks the Martians will become idiots), who tries to sabotage the fun. And then there's Dropo, the comic relief Martian who somehow makes things work out in the end.

Like quite a few people of my generation, my first exposure to SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS was courtesy of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. But to see this movie on its own is the way to go, especially around Christmas! Despite the low-budget (I would go as far as to say because of it), the movie is fun in the way every Christmas movie should be. You gotta love Torg, the big robot that helps the Martians get Santa, and the climax involving lots of toys! And like many low-budget movies, this one had two future stars: Pia Zadora (Girmar), who won a Golden Globe in 1982 and two back-to-back Razzies in 1982 and 1983, and Bill McCutcheon (Dropo), who became best known as Uncle Wally on SESAME STREET! And the theme song ""Hooray For Santa Claus"" is one that gets stuck in your head for days on end!

Kino Lorber's Blu-Ray of SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS (also on DVD) is a must-own for your Holiday parties.

SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS (1964) just may be the biggest holiday turkey in cinematic history!

It's a kiddie adventure story that's remembered (if at all) as the screen debut of Pia Zadora. Shot on a ten-cent budget in an abandoned aircraft hanger on Long Island, Santa and the Martians is a perennial favorite on almost every Worst Movie list.

Is this picture as bad as its hype? Absolutely! Would I suggest you see for yourself how awful the film really is? Hey, why not? It's good for a few laughs, some unintended of course.

SCCTM's memorably terrible melody, ""Hooray For Santy Claus"" was written by accordionist Milton DeLugg. His polka ""Hoop Dee Doo"" was popular on TV game shows. DeLugg is most famous for producing Buddy Holly's ""Rave On"" and most infamous for the song in this movie. He wrote the original theme to THE NEWLYWED GAME and was musical director of Chuck Barris' GONG SHOW (whenever a contestant won on this program, DeLugg's ""Hoop Dee Doo"" was played).

But back to the turkey on our plates. Here's my favorite bit of dialogue from SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS:

Hargo: What's soft and round and you put it on a stick and you toast it in a fire, and it's green?
Kimar: I don't know what?
Hargo: A Martian mellow.

Martians want to bring Santa to Mars to teach Martian kids how to have fun. They journey to Earth, at Christmas Time, intent on kidnapping Santa. They don't know how to find the real Santa so they make two Earth kids show them where the real one is. They bring Santa and the two kids back to Mars.

A toy factory is set up on Mars for Santa to make toys for the Martian children. The adult Martians believe toys are a way to teach Martian children about fun.

One Martian objects to the idea of Martian kids having any fun so he tries to kill Santa.

Santa must find a way to stay alive plus get back to Earth in time to deliver Christmas presents to the Earth children.

Pia Zadora plays one of the Martian children.

There's a cheesy song, bad acting, bad costumes, silly situations and a low budget that's obvious. It all adds up to a movie so bad that it's good.

The children of Mars (all two of them) are becoming withdrawn and depressed, which a crazy old hermit declares to be a sign that MARS NEEDS... SANTA CLAUS! So  the Martians to go Earth to kidnap Santa Claus, so he can spread holiday joy. With the help of two idiotic human kids, they get to the North Pole and capture Santa Claus (John Call), who seems to be just fine about being abducted to another planet.

 The title ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" actually sounds kind of cool -- like it might contain Santa and an elf army waging interstellar war. Unfortunately, instead we get an amalgam of every Christmas cliche and poorly-imagined Z-movie scifi trope, in one sloppy sopping treacly mess.

The dialogue is about as entertaining as a railroad spike in the eye (""What's soft and round and you put it on a stick and you toast it in a fire, and it's green? A Martian mallow!""), the sets are painfully cheap (IS THERE MORE THAN ONE MARTIAN HOUSE?), and there's not really any plot. Santa and the kids sort of saunter around being annoyingly cheery, and Voldar periodically tries to kidnap and/or kill them.

It also has one of the most chaotic, ridiculous climaxes ever inflicted on an audience, involving one of the bad guys being beaten up with TOYS. It's even stupider than it sounds.

As for the acting, it's horrendous. The children manage to be wooden, twee and affected all at the same time, and Santa is obviously high as a kite (attempted murder? HOHOHOHO!). And the Martians are inept bumblers who couldn't find their feet with a telescope, including a subplot where Voldar and his goons can't tell that A MARTIAN IN A SANTA SUIT isn't the real Santa.

As the icing, we also have Bill McCutcheon as Dropo, a blithering drooling dolt of a Martian who is meant to be charming comic relief, but who is about as funny as licking the third rail.

209901,2,6300147789,"This special season is an ideal time to contemplate what may be the biggest holiday bomb in cinematic history, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS (1964).

It's a kiddie adventure story that's remembered (if at all) as the screen debut of Pia Zadora. Shot on a ten-cent budget in abandoned aircraft hanger on Long Island, Santa and the Martians is a perennial favorite on almost every Worst Movie list.

Is it as bad as its hype? Absolutely! Would I suggest you check it out to see for yourself if this one's as awful as they say?  Hey, why not? It's good for a few laughs, some unintended of course.

The film's memorably terrible chorus number, ""Hooray For Santy Claus"" was written by accordionist Milton DeLugg. His polka ""Hoop Dee Doo"" was popular on TV game shows. DeLugg is most famous for producing Buddy Holly's ""Rave On"" and most infamous for the song in this movie. He wrote the original theme to THE NEWLYWED GAME and was musical director of Chuck Barris' legendary Gong Show (whenever a contestant won on this program, DeLugg's ""Hoop Dee Doo"" was played).

But back to the film in question. Here's my favorite bit of dialogue from SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS:

Hargo: What's soft and round and you put it on a stick and you toast it in a fire, and it's green?
Kimar: I don't know what?

Instead of a totally bad and idiotic film, this one really isn't over-the-top stupid, it is pretty fun.  There are two levels:  little kids can watch this and believe it, the adults can laugh along with the directors.

I remember seeing this as a kid, indeed the images and props are what I see clearest in the mind's eye, particularly the clunky disintegration guns.  Indeed, the scenes resemble the environment in the 64-65 World's Fair in Queens, or so I imagine.  As I'd hoped, it brought back lots of scenes and feelings about the images I grew up with on TV and at constructed theme parks.  FOr that, I would recommend the film.

OK, the story if really weird and the acting certainly isn't great.  But there is something that worked for me, to be sure perhaps only personally.

Recommended for nostalgia.  ALas, I did not get it when my kids might have believed it.",1289692800,,994,4.522471910112359
209957,3,6300147789,"Presumably the creators of SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS intended to make a viable children's holiday movie.  What they actually accomplished was something that looked like a collison between The Three Stooges and The Patty Duke Show with excruciatingly bad production values.  But while most bad movies are simply bad, this one is bad in an amusing way.

The cast has a surprising range of talent.  The movie was filmed near New York--sets were actually built in an abandoned airplane hanger--and the cast consisted of stage actors the producers could pick up cheap between shows.  John Call (Santa), Leonard Hicks (Kimar), and Vincent Beck (Voldar) were all well-known stage actors, but the most famous player is probably Bill McCutcheon (Dropo), who would go on to appear in such films as STEEL MAGNOLIAS and win a Tony Award for the 1988 revival of ANYTHING GOES.  And then, of course, there is Pia Zadora.  About eight years old at the time of filming, Zadora sang appeared as the Martian child Girmar.  Born in 1954, Zadora was actually a competent juvenile actress on the stage, appearing with no less than Tallulah Bankhead in 1961 and later having successful runs in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF and a road company of APPLAUSE.  She was also mildly successful as a 1980s-era singer, more so in Europe than in the United States.  What she wasn't, by any stretch of the imagination, was a movie star.  She was an atrocious film actress, and she is as bad here as she would be in such films as BUTTERFLY and LONELY LADY some twenty years later.

The story is ridiculous and the dialogue more so.  Martian children have become depressed; their parents kidnap Santa Claus in an effort to bring Christmas-like merriment to Mars.  The plan is complicated by a Martian who wants to destroy Santa (Vincent Beck as Voldar) and a sappy Martian who is forever getting into trouble (Bill McCutcheon as Dropo.)  Fortunately for all, Santa survives both the kidnapping and the naughty Martians, does indeed bring Christmas merriment to the planet, and then returns to earth.  Well, okay, and ho-hum.  The performances are uniformly terrible, and John Call particularly so as Santa, but the real shiners here are the production values.  The sets look very much like construction paper and poster board applied to wooden frameworks.  The make-up is chiefly notable for a visibly greasy quality.  The costumes... apparently the Martians have no fashion sense.  They dress in olive drap tights and wear copper tubing on their heads.  As if this were not enough, the color balance is absolutely horrific, and dare we even mention ""Hurray for Santa Claus?""  Recorded by Pia Zadora, the song plays out over the opening titles (which contain a typo: instead of ""costumes"" they have ""custumes"") and again over the end titles.  It is dreadful.  It is also, perversely, very catchy.  Like it or not, you'll be stuck with it in your head for days afterward.

There's bad and there's bad, and in truth SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS isn't gouge-your-eyes-out bad in the same sense as, say, MANOS, HANDS OF FATE; it's more akin to the dopey bad one encounters in PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.  Whatever the case, the movie has fallen into public domain and is widely available on the internet, in a host of DVD releases, and perhaps most ridiculously in a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 episode in which it is soundly ridiculed by Joel and his 'bots.  In whatever form, recommended to bad film lovers everywhere.

210001,4,6300147789,"When a group of Martian space travelers realize their children are discontented and becoming too involved with watching Earth television programs, a mystical Martian elder sends them on a mission to kidnap Santa Claus in the hopes that he will bring them the seasonal cheer they are lacking. However, villainous Voldar doesn't want the mature Martian children to be affected by such weakening and silly Earth customs. Santa and two Earth children are soon in Martian hands and in grave danger from Voldar and his cronies. Can Santa and the spirit of the season put things right before it is too late?

""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is widely considered one of the worst films ever, despite its scores of fans. Of course, that ""so bad it's good"" quality is the very reason it has such a cult following. This 1964 camp classic is pretty awful and loaded with bad movie cliches, from bad costumes to bad sets, to bad lines and everything else! It all adds up to some awfully good fun!

The PC Treasures DVD is probably not the best way to own this movie, but it's definitely one of the cheapest (and I'm really not sure if a definitive DVD of this one has even been released). Adding to it are a fine pair of animated holiday offerings, though not in outstanding quality. However, everything is watchable and the main feature is of the same quality I am used to seeing on such DVDs and online. The two animated programs are a classic Fleischer cartoon called ""Somewhere in Dreamland"", in which two very poor children dream of having the time of their lives in a magical land on Christmas Eve, and ""The Night Before Christmas,"" a touching animated classic about how Dr. Clement Moore wrote ""A Visit from Saint Nicholas"" for his ailing daughter. I'm sure that, to many, this DVD is worth purchasing just for the rare and highly enjoyable ""The Night Before Christmas"" half-hour program.

Incidentally, if you enjoy ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" look for a similarly fascinating film: ""Santa Claus"". It's a Mexican children's film, dubbed in English, in which a bizarre Santa is constantly being thwarted by a devil named Pitch! That one will give you nightmares!",1199318400,4,2169,4.778666666666667

210056,4,6300147789,"If you say ""Santa Clause Conquers Martians"" is the worst film ever made, I won't disagree. I think I have recently seen much worse (and more costly) films coming from Hollywood (how about ""Son of the Mask""?), but I am sure that even kids would find ""SCCM"" stunningly terrible with its wooden acting, impossible plot and incredible dialogues (a girl says to a Martian with antennae in his head: ""Are you a television set?"") and the cheaply set obviously made from cardboard.

For some die-hard filmgoers, certain ""bad"" films become good because of their badness, but I seriously doubt ""Santa"" would be one of them. I enjoyed watching it - its robot, miniature spaceship and fearful ""Polar bear"" - they all look cheap, and kind of fun to be sure, but the film's pace is very slack. The ""joy"" of watching silly things like a bargain-basement robot moving awkwardly (and suddenly forgotten in the middle of the plot) soon evaporates because of the poor, really poor direction.

[PIA ZADRA] But I couldn't hate the film for ... how can I? Pia Zadra (her debut, with her face painted green) appears as ""Girmar"" (""Girl"" + ""Martian""), who keeps watching television (or intergalactic TV from Earth). Concerned daddy Kimar insists that kids on the Mars needs Santa Claus, travels to the Earth and kidnaps him from his workshop. It's family and love!

Oh, and the story. ""Santa Clause Conquers Martians"" - this silly title tells you all, you may think. Well, it surely conveys to us the film's utter silliness, but not exactly the content. Actually, in this film Santa (or Santy Claus as the film calls him) does not ""conquer"" the Mars and its green-faced residents. As I said, he is only abducted by them (together with two earthling kids Billy and Betty); Santa in fact ""conquers"" the Martians with toys, humor and his routine Ho-ho-ho! Here is a film waiting to be remade by Tim Burton.

But seriously, the most charming part is that Martians here are mostly kind and gentle, not ferocious, brutal and ruthless killers of H. G. Wells. The leader Kimar strictly forbids destroying anything and anybody and sticks to his principle to the end. Considering the time it was made (it was 1964), maybe we shouldn't make fun of its apparently silly story about the benevolent aliens ""conquered"" by Santa Claus and his toys.

Well, anyway, sit back and enjoy yourself. This is a ""family picture"" Ed Wood might have done.",1187654400,2,2403,4.780722891566265

In the theater, I remember having a great time with all the other kids in the audience: this movie had it all, as far as we were concerned - Santa Claus, Martians, a robot, toys, comic relief, spaceships - perfect for the children of the mid-1960s. It wasn't until many years later that I came to appreciate what I call ""The Cheese Factor"", i.e.: a movie made with minimal budget but with heart, something that kids will love and adults will roll their eyes. Today's children probably wouldn't give this move the time of day, which is a shame because they need an alternative to violent Anime-inspired cartoons and video games, and appreciate an effort that - while it has the look and feel of a glorified school play - is aimed for children of all ages who just want to have some fun and enjoy some silliness without worrying about whether ""it's the bomb"". This DVD preserves the ""public domain"" look; you feel like you are watching a FILM, complete with grain and scratches, as it should. Turn off the lights and transport yourself back to the big movie theater full of other kids, singing along to the title music (the lyrics, after all, are provided right there on the screen). The additions of the seasonal cartoon and Sherlock Holmes piece make it feel like the old ""double feature and a cartoon"" from days gone by. This DVD is a welcome respite from all the glossy high-tech films being cranked out today.

Go kidnap Santa Claus to make the children happy.

One of the Martians, a friendly sort named Voldar (Vincent Beck), thinks they should be tougher on the children and he also has a propensity for wanting to kill just about everything in sight.

The heroes of the story are Billy (Victor Stiles) and Betty (Donna Conforti), who manage to keep one step ahead of Voldar, and are ultimately instrumental in saving Santa Claus.

The special effects are cheap and cheesy.  The acting is generally awful.  The dialogue sounds like something from a bad 50s television show.

Here it is in the nutshell...The Martians nab Santa & two Earth children. The Martian leader forces Santa & the children to run their toy fabricator. Everyone is Prozac-happy, except for one Martian who decides he must have Santa for himself. Santa has the kids & the Martian kids toss toys at the evil Martians. Good prevails & Santa returns to Earth, letting the dim-witted-side-kick Martian CEO the Martian Toy Monopoly.

210096,4,6300147789,"It's the kookiest Christmas ever when Santa Claus is kidnapped by Martians in this ""you have to see it to believe it"" Christmas ""classic."" Maybe you've seen this movie hilariously skewered on Mystery Science Theater 3000, but you have to watch it on its own to truly appreciate it. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is just so bad that I can't help but love it, and that explains why I am giving this deservedly one-star movie four stars. The Martian get-ups are more ridiculous than Marvin the Martian's normal attire, the sets redefine the very definition of cheap, the acting is over-the-top and generally horrible, and Santa is - well, he's just a little bit weird, if you ask me. Every time the guy starts in with his distinctive laughing (usually for no apparent reason), I am reminded of the fact that Satan is spelled with the same letters as Santa.

Things aren't going so well on Mars. It's bad enough that the Martians are all colored a ridiculous shade of green, dress like rejected superheroes, and wear ridiculous antenna-spouting helmets on their heads at all times, but now the children of Mars are all acting depressed and withdrawn; all they want to do is sit and watch Earth TV. Kimar (Leonard Hicks), the leader of Mars, seeks the advice of the planet's 800-year old wise man and is told that he must bring Santa Claus to Mars so that the children can actually have fun and be children for a little while. Voldar (Vincent Beck) opposes the plan every step of the way, arguing that Kimar's plan will soon result in a whole planet full of lily-livered, mush-brained nincompoops. Kimar wins out and sets off for Earth in the most pathetic spaceship of all time to catch Santa and bring him back to Mars - along with two Earthling children. Well, Santa starts up a new workshop on Mars, hoping he'll be allowed to return home in time for Christmas, but Voldar is as tenacious as he is ridiculous-looking and is determined to kill Santa and stomp out all signs of Christmas spirit on the red planet.

Santa Claus Conquers the Martians features a young Pia Zadora as a little Martian girl, but perhaps the movie's most unforgettable feature is the swinging theme song, Hooray for Santa Claus. If you watch the movie, you'll have this silly song in your head for days. Dropo (Bill McCutcheon) gives a memorable performance as Mars' resident screw-up with a heart of gold, but my thoughts always remain with John Call and his disturbingly weird portrayal of Santa Claus. I can pretty much guarantee that this movie will make you laugh with its unashamed ineptness, and bad movie lovers are ineligible for their very first merit badge until they have watched Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and lived to tell about it.",1127606400,7,2731,4.69937369519833

Once there, he ""conquers"" his green-tinted captors with his rather bizarre charm and silly wit. Lots of flashing lights, a spaceship that looks like a flying bundle of toilet paper rolls, Torg the robot, and ""freeze-ray"" guns are just some of the highlights! This is totally harmless holiday fluff. Of course, you parents may want to duck out while the kids enjoy it, as watching it may induce a state not unlike suffering a stroke while sleeping with your head in a vice!

210098,5,6300147789,"Yeah, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a pretty good movie. However, the movie I joyfully watch every Christmas is about martians who, lacking a Santa Claus to bring joy to martian kids, kidnap Santa from Earth, along with two children. ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is almost sublime in its badness, and with painted-green martials in skintight suits, a Santa with a lewd chuckle instead of a ""Ho Ho Ho,"" incredible wooden acting by the cast (one of whom is Pia Zadora), unspeakable special effects, and a horrible theme song, it is a masterpiece of the so-bad-it's-good school of film. Just TRY getting the theme song out of your head.
The DVD from Laserlight looks exactly as one would expect it - awful. The supersaturated colour scheme has not aged well, and looks very grainy.

210133,1,6300147789,"If you have ever wondered whether there are any truly awful Christmas-themed films, there are.  In all likelihood, the worst Christmas-themed film of all time (and one of the worst films of any genre of all time) is the 1964 flop ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".  Picture (if you dare) the unhappy and non-playful children of Mars, with one of them, named Girmar, played by the not-particularly-talented actress Pia Zadora.  Her brother, Bomar, was played by Chris Month, whose only other acting role was an appearance in a single episode of a long-forgotten 1964 TV show.  Their father, Kimar (Leonard Hicks, 1918-1971, whose only other acting role in the 1964 film ""Guns of the Trees"" is uncredited), decides, after consulting with an 800-year old Martian in a cave, that the best way to help the sad and non-playful children of Mars is to kidnap Santa Claus (John Call, 1915-1973) from Earth's North Pole and bring him to Mars so that he can make toys for Martian children.  Kidnapped along with Santa Claus are two annoying Earthling children: Billy (Victor Stiles) and Betty (Donna Conforti).  Can you think of any two names more precious than Billy & Betty? (Gag!)  One Martian, Voldar (Vincent Beck, 1924-1984, one of the few 'stars' of this flop that actually had an acting career), is opposed to Santa Claus; but Kimar overrules him.  However, the completely annoying (am I being redundant?) Martian named Dropo (Bill McCutcheon, 1924-2002, who played Owen Jenkins in the wonderful 1989 ""Steel Magnolias"" and also had a real acting career) becomes Santa Claus' best Martian assistant.

Now, if this flop of a film's plot hasn't been bad enough, just wait: it gets worse! You also get to hear the delightful (correction: insidious!) song ""Hooray for Santa Claus"" (written by Roy Alfred & Milton Delugg), not just once, but twice during this film's miserable 81 minutes.  Further, to give you an idea of just how 'well-written' this film's script is, my favorite quote comes from the TV interviewer (Don Blair) when he says, ""Wow-wee-wow!""  Of course, what can you expect from a film whose estimated budget was $200,000?  Who, then, you may ask, was the 'creative genius' behind ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""?  It was none-other-than Paul L. Jacobson, who both produced it and wrote its ridiculous story.  Not surprisingly, Paul L. Jacobson was never involved in any other film or TV show at all!  In other words, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is his legacy to mankind.  Rather than name those other 'actors' who also appeared in this film, I will spare them the obvious embarrassment that they would probably prefer to forget.

With absolutely no hesitation whatsoever, I wholeheartedly rate ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" with a well-deserved & lowest-ranking 1 out of 5 stars.  Please, I beg of you, don't subject any child or adult to this 1964 celluloid disaster.  (As a side note, Victor Stiles & Donna Conforti never acted in anything ever again either!)",1101254400,5,2989,4.98991935483871

210137,4,6300147789,"It's the kookiest Christmas ever when Santa Claus is kidnapped by Martians in this ""you have to see it to believe it"" Christmas ""classic.""  Maybe you've seen this movie hilariously skewered on Mystery Science Theater 3000, but you have to watch it on its own to truly appreciate it.  Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is just so bad that I can't help but love it, and that explains why I am giving this deservedly one-star movie four stars.  The Martian get-ups are more ridiculous than Marvin the Martian's normal attire, the sets redefine the very definition of cheap, the acting is over-the-top and generally horrible, and Santa is - well, he's just a little bit weird, if you ask me.  Every time the guy starts in with his distinctive laughing (usually for no apparent reason), I am reminded of the fact that Satan is spelled with the same letters as Santa.
Things aren't going so well on Mars.  It's bad enough that the Martians are all colored a ridiculous shade of green, dress like rejected superheroes, and wear ridiculous antenna-spouting helmets on their heads at all times, but now the children of Mars are all acting depressed and withdrawn; all they want to do is sit and watch Earth TV.  Kimar (Leonard Hicks), the leader of Mars, seeks the advice of the planet's 800-year old wise man and is told that he must bring Santa Claus to Mars so that the children can actually have fun and be children for a little while.  Voldar (Vincent Beck) opposes the plan every step of the way, arguing that Kimar's plan will soon result in a whole planet full of lily-livered, mush-brained nincompoops.  Kimar wins out and sets off for Earth in the most pathetic spaceship of all time to catch Santa and bring him back to Mars - along with two Earthling children.  Well, Santa starts up a new workshop on Mars, hoping he'll be allowed to return home in time for Christmas, but Voldar is as tenacious as he is ridiculous-looking and is determined to kill Santa and stomp out all signs of Christmas spirit on the red planet.
Santa Claus Conquers the Martians features a young Pia Zadora as a little Martian girl, but perhaps the movie's most unforgettable feature is the swinging theme song, Hooray for Santa Claus.  If you watch the movie, you'll have this silly song in your head for days.  Dropo (Bill McCutcheon) gives a memorable performance as Mars' resident screw-up with a heart of gold, but my thoughts always remain with John Call and his disturbingly weird portrayal of Santa Claus.  I can pretty much guarantee that this movie will make you laugh with its unashamed ineptness, and bad movie lovers are ineligible for their very first merit badge until they have watched Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and lived to tell about it.",1071792000,53,2741,4.69937369519833

It seems odd that such a poor release gets a full two stars, but I am taking into account the lack of availability of any other version, as well as the clunky extras. The bonus features on this release are varied: an alleged trailer for some old film (it's not a trailer at all, just a random clip), some holiday-themed cartoons (sources are scratchy, color-turned prints that were probably dug out of an attic trash bin of some old drive-in...), and some new ersatz segue sequences that are supposed to mirror the old bits that were popular in theatres before the age of the multiplex (shown in between trailers and cartoons). Here, they are worthless. By design, their only appeal is to film buffs, but film buffs will have no interest in modern reproductions. With all that thrashed film from the attic, surely the real thing was there, as well. Oh, and there's a B&W John Wayne spot for Christmas Seals from the 50's, which is a nice touch.
The print for SCCTM is so [bad], it doesn't even contain the actual title from the opening credits. Catcom (the publisher of the DVD) must have sought long and hard to find a copy of this flick in such wretched shape. There's nothing retro about a print that looks like it (barely) survived an explosion.
I'll keep my copy just as a memento of how [bad] a DVD release can actually be. The rest of you will probably want to wait for a version with the title screen...",1060905600,3,1683,4.432258064516129

This film should have been forgotten.  The title says it all.  In fact, Santa Clause doesn't fight the Martians; the little children do.

210171,2,6300147789,"If Ed Wood would have ever made a Christmas movie, this would have been it. There are a lot of bad Christmas movies out there. There are also a lot of cheesy Christmas movies. Heck, there's a few bad, cheesy Christmas movies. But, this has got to be the best (or worst, however you want to look at it) of bad, cheesy Christmas movies.

The plot runs something like this. The children of Mars are all depressed and the leader of the planet thinks it has something to do with all the ""Earth programs"" the young fries are watching on the ""video"". ""Something is happening to the children of Mars."", he says. He and the Martian Council seek this 800 year old Martian who lives in the woods for advice. He tells them it's because the Martian kids are no longer able to be children; they have no games, toys, and can no longer laugh. They are seeing how happy the Earth children are because of Santa Claus and Christmas and it makes it worse. So, the Martians decide to go to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus. That's right, kidnap Santa Claus. Of course, they have to steal a couple of Earth kids who give them directions, too. But that's beside the point (or is it?).

Anyway, the sets on the film look like something constructed by an elementary school class and the makeup is horrible (they must have used the worst possible green makeup around). The script is horrible and the dialogue is filled with bad jokes (what's round, plump, green, and you roast in a fire? Answer: a Martianmellow) and even a few sexist remarks.

But it gets even better than that. When the U.S. Air Strategic Command responds to the initial sighting of the Martian ship (that looks like a reconstructed eggbeater), some of the planes taking off are PASSENGER JETS! Later on when the kidnapped kids run away from the Martian ship and try to find Santa's workshop, a man in a polar bear suit chases them. Actually, it's more like a man in white tights with a polar bear head and claws.

The movie was the only major achievement for many of its actors, but it does include a young Pia Zadora as a Martian child and it has the catchy 60's Christmas song ""Hooray for Santy Claus"". So, basically this movie has just about everything you could expect out of a bad, cheesy, Christmas movie and a few things you can't (like the polar bear).",1019347200,,2300,4.4560570071258905

Be inspired as Carl Don's character, the 800+ year old Martian wiseman, proclaims, ""We Need A Santa Claus on Mars!"" Get downright geocentric as the Earth's Christmas Holiday spirit prevails over the Red Planet's system of overbearing logic and Grinch-esque gloom.

The wonderful cast of Martians consisted of nobody actors (including a young Pia Zadora) in green makeup, green body suits, and antennae on their head!  Oh yeah!  There was also a goofy (and incredibly annoying) Martian who looked like he was the product of an affair between Jamie Farr and Imogene Coca.

It's hard to believe grown adults would wear those goofy martian helmets(they had to starving).  But this is a fun movie.  That bouncy theme song; Voldar the nasty martian; and, if I'm not mistaken, Stobo the martian has a striking resemblence to Jamie Farr.  The final credits say Al Nesor, but I believe that was an alias acting name for Mr. Farr back then.  No wonder he changed his name for the movie.

And there are a lot of people who have dubbed it The Worst Christmas Movie ever made; I personally find this to be really unfair.

This movie is fun and entertaining in a very childish and naive way that simply cant be found anymore. I hear it actually did respectable business upon its original release, and I can see why. Its fun, funny, it makes you laugh, and its innocence adds to the appeal. I always thought the main reason people attack it simply because its such a broad target. And I cant help feeling genuinely sorry for the little Martian girl who innocently asks her brother, What is a doll?

In other words, I completely disagree with the idea that the is supposedly the worst Christmas movie ever made; Ive seen many Ive hated despite being a big Christmas buff who cant wait to watch Christmas movies. For example, I personally find the sets and costumes (and everything else, frankly) of the original Tim Allen film The Santa Clause FAR worse that whats here. But the WORST? So far, for my money, A Christmas Story gets THAT prize.

Proof that drugs & alcohol are often used on motion picture sets, (and strongly recommended for those of you at home contemplating watching this of your own free will). Let the tinsel-trimmed torture begin! 5 STARS

THE STORY: The listless children of Mars just sit and sulk, much to the confusion & consternation of their parents. Consulting with their high priest, the Red Planet's leaders are informed that their computer-taught & chemically-controlled children are essentially being denied their childhood. If such a joyless existence is allowed to continue, in another generation or two the entire Martian race faces extinction! Simply put: the depressed tots are in desperate need of fun & happiness! What to do? Why... kidnap Santa Claus, of course! (?) To accomplish this task, a rocketship of stealthy Martian commandos is sent to Earth. Once there, the Martian meanies strongarm a couple of precocious Earth children into pointing the way to Santa's Workshop. After some not too perilous peril, involving a rabid polar bear attack & the mechanical menace of the Martians' robotic enforcer, Torg, the two kids & jolly old Saint Nick are whisked away to the Red Planet, instructed to cheer up the mundane lives of all the sad Martian kiddies.... or else!

THOUGHTS: As mainstream moves go, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS surely must rank as one of the oddest ever made. The entire cast is made up of unknowns, except for a young pre-celebrity Pia Zadora, as Martian tyke, Girmar, and Ned Wertimer, as KID-TV reporter Andy Henderson. (Wertimer's main claim to fame was portraying Ralph, the eternally-shafted doorman on The Jeffersons). All of the actors play the film completely straight-faced, with nary an eye-roll nor stifled giggle to be found. Astonishing, considering the ridiculous costumes, totally unconvincing make-ups and thoroughly atrocious ""special effects"" the film contains. (All of which would be right at home in a typical third grade Christmas play.) Seriously, one need only look as far as the 'terrifying' polar bear and ""Torg"" the Martian robot henchman, to see that the film's total F/X budget couldn't have exceeded $125, tops. Still, the movie somehow manages to be entertaining, in a twisted sort of fever dream/train wreck way. It's better viewed in the terrific Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, which is perhaps their best holiday effort. (Although it's a close tie with their lampooning of the Mexican-lensed Christmas catastrophe, ""Santa Claus."") Viewed as-is, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS takes a strong will (or some strong drink) to make it through in one setting. Very young children, undoubtedly the target audience of this film, may well enjoy it. Anyone over the age of six or seven will likely be reaching for the remote or an air sick bag (or both).

THE BLU-RAY: While not an ultra-sharp frame-by-frame restoration, this film, (up until now consigned to faded, washed out, jittery junk quality Public Domain copies), looks better than it has in years, perhaps since its theatrical debut. It's not as good as it could look, but it's likely due to the condition of whatever source materials Horizon/Kino Lorber had to work with. The video still contains a fair amount of debris and grit, but far less than I've seen in previous PD releases. Thankfully the color palette here is quite strong in comparison to the wretched PD stuff. Audio is a mostly clear & level mono. An eclectic assortment of bonus goodies round out this Blu-ray release. Best of the bunch is the compilation of theatrical bumpers, shorts and holiday-related bits touted as ""The Retro Holiday Film Festival."" There's also a cute Fleisher Christmas cartoon, some old commercials and a short Howdy Doody clip. Pretty neat stuff.",1486771200,5,3910,5.135007849293563
