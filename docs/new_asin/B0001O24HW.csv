2794804,2,B0001O24HW,"Nice story best read rather than watched. The movie was mediocre at best. Acting, script and filming all failed to present the potential of the story.",1453161600,,150,4.8076923076923075
2794805,3,B0001O24HW,"It was a decent film.  The little girl has acted really good.  The wisest saying in the whole movie is that by the old man in the train who says ""knowledge is easy, it the understanding that is difficult.""  A guru can impart knowledge, but the understanding has to come from within, there is no teacher or guru for this.",1448236800,,320,4.3

2794814,4,B0001O24HW,"Brings back memories...I really enjoyed this as a kid. However, when I think about the frenetic pace of most kid's movies today, I'm not sure if it will keep their attention like it did ours when we were children. Still a beautiful story, though.",1427155200,,246,4.613636363636363

2794816,5,B0001O24HW,I sat and watched this yesterday because it was a favorite of my children years ago. I still enjoyed the story line and the movie!,1424563200,3,130,4.24
2794817,5,B0001O24HW,I had been looking for this movie for a long time. My girl's loved it when they were younger and wanted to share it with their daughters so I was great full to find a copy of it. Thank you,1424390400,,188,3.725
2794818,2,B0001O24HW,"If you are easily entertained by fantasy, you may find this one ok. It wasn't my cup of tea though and would not watch it again. The movie does kind of hold your interest and the acting was ok.",1422230400,,193,3.9743589743589745
2794819,3,B0001O24HW,Simply fun to watch. And I did not realize that Milla had done movies so young.,1419897600,,79,4.0
2794820,5,B0001O24HW,"I'm a little biased because I was friends with Eddie Castrodad during the period when this film was made, but even if I hadn't known him I'm sure I'd at least give this movie 4 stars.  I purchased a copy on VHS in 1992, before realizing that Eddie was in this movie.  I've since watched it at least half a dozen times.  I keep hoping they will release it on DVD, because I don't expect my VHS copy to last much longer.

This was a made for TV movie with a low budget.  At the time, the only well known cast member was Pernell Roberts (Bonanza / Trapper John MD), and his role in this movie is pretty minimal since the story revolves around Milla Jovovich and Eddie Castrodad's characters. They were both teenagers with limited acting experience, but the director did a fantastic job with them and they both pulled off their roles with perfect believability.  To be critical, The plot is fairly simple and almost predictable.  The peril is low key.  That said, the peril is tangible enough to keep your attention, and the plot is unique and interesting.  This movie is a good clean adventure with an original storyline, good characters, good acting, great scenery, and good cinematography.  It certainly exceeds the expectations of a made for TV movie in the eighties.  You won't find million dollar special effects or convoluted plot twists.  This is the kind of film you can enjoy on a Sunday afternoon with your family - including grandma. without having to worry about foul language, violence, or ""mature"" scenes.",1419033600,4,1516,4.657894736842105

2794822,5,B0001O24HW,I keep watching this movie again and again.  It is enjoyable story of trip to Kathmandu. I hope to see this in DVD format since it is only in VHS made in 1988,1402444800,2,158,3.787878787878788
2794823,4,B0001O24HW,"I have been looking everywhere for a copy of this movie. Not only was I finally able to get a VHS copy, but it was still the movie I remembered. I am very happy.",1388016000,,161,3.764705882352941

8184879,5,B0001O24HW,"This turned out to be a very nice watch. I do say that my wife and I enjoy movies like this, one about a Nepalese city that is usually invisible and appears rarely. When the city appears, its prince can enter the visible world until the month ends. This story happens to a girl from an American academic family in Nepal for a teaching engagement. Pernell Roberts of Bonanza appears in this. I never cared for Roberts but he plays a villain, sort of, he's a bit greedy and grubby when confronted with a miracle such as a city that can appear and disappear.

This movie was a delight to find. I hope Mr Roberts had a good time making this movie. The girl and her little brother were good. The parents played roles of self-interested parents well; so well that I failed to find them sympathetic. Another role, a (Nepalese) professor, was good.",1465776000,,840,4.454545454545454

8184881,1,B0001O24HW,80's oriental magical realism. Why did I watch it? I have not excuse. It was filmed in Nepal and it made me want to go back.,1458000000,,124,3.8076923076923075

8184887,2,B0001O24HW,A good movie...if you're a silly 13-year old girl.  Corny beyond belief.  If you're a teenage girl or an addicted soap opera watcher this is your movie...enjoy.  For the rest of us it's a great natural way to induce vomiting....,1454284800,,228,4.65
