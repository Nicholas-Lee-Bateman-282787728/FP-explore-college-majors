4073307,5,B00366E1CS,"I just took a Burlesque Beat Class from director and choreographer Rodney James in California and purchased his Burlesque Beat:  Sexy Fitness Dance Workout.  I really appreciated how Rodney showed step by step how to gracefully perform dance moves.  He has helped me improve my posture awareness and strengthen my core stability.  Not only has Burlesque Beat made my body stronger, it has made me more confident in my sexuality.  I would highly recommend his Burlesque Beat:  Sexy Fitness Dance Workout to anyone.

4073308,5,B00366E1CS,"Think Gay-Club meets Housewife! This is a beginner/intermediate burlesque routine. If you are a hardcore dancer, this will be too slow. If you're an average person, this is perfect for pretending you're performing on the stage. There's a longer final-dance routine and more detailed instruction than the scant PussyCat Dolls workout or Carmen Electra's DVDS. I love PCD and Carmen, but Rodney James did such a great job on this one. It walks the fine-line between dance/fun/fitness. Hard to get all three of those even in a work-out, but he does.

The all-important final dance is 3.5 minutes of a cabaret act of medium careful-moves intensity. It is NOT a super-fast routine you can't keep up with. What it does have is quick full-body moves that look very vampy and condition your arms, legs, back, etc. This is not a heavy-foot chorography routine where you won't be able to get fast enough to the next place; it's very natural and flows but is in time with the energizing dance beat.

The main final routine is dressed-up! Part chair-dance with sassy-ness and cheek and part floor-work, rolling around down there, half pushups, twisting at times to get up, etc. Lots of sexy walking around chairs, draping yourself and your legs overtop them and around them. The music is great:--it's a fast 80's dance-club beat that's not annoying; the songs are catchy and fun. This is burlesque 101.

Rodney himself is pure flamboyance in his black, patent-leather high-heeled boots and sexy mini-shorts. He's so caring and encouraging to his audience. There's an ending low-intensity chorography and final dance, as well, for a group of girlfriends to learn, very simple, less complex than the main dance. It could be used almost as a cool down. It's clear from Rodney's warm Austrailian accent that he has a great attitude and wants you to dance, be fabulous, and celebrate yourself. I do feel like a REAL dancer in this routine because I learned one! - and if you do it in heels, it's an extra-sexy challange for the legs. Rodney, you did a great job, hope you're working on part two.",1277942400,47,2078,4.831460674157303
4073309,5,B00366E1CS,"I disagree with the other review.  I received a screener copy of this and found it to be a very fun workout. Rodney James is completely over the top, he should have his own show.  The dance moves and attitude are similar to Broadway shows like 'Chicago' and 'Cabaret.'  I wouldn't say the moves were mannish at all.

4073336,3,B00366E1CS,The guy who teaches this is great. He brings a lot of energy and gets you motivated. He works at a pace that anyone can work to. The only problem is I didn't feel any pain or tightness in my abs....maybe doing it one time doesn't make a different. Idk its really just stripper dancing so I'm not sure how that would help me.,1370995200,,324,4.078125

It seriously feels sleazy not sexy.

4073340,5,B00366E1CS,"Loved the DVD. It was fun. How often do you get to work out with a fun man in sparkles?

I do not use the DVD too often because I am busy, not the greatest housekeeper, and have a couple of cats.  To do this exercise routine comfortably, you need a somewhat large expanse of floor that is free of debris-- you need to get on the floor.  I love the idea, and I love the moves, but I cannot always bring myself to roll around on my floor.",1332460800,4,436,3.8764044943820224
4073351,5,B00366E1CS,"Rodney James IS ""Mr. Burlesque"" and if you haven't been lucky enough to catch him when he's on tour, this DVD provides the basics of the amazing program he's created! His energy is contagious and his un-biased and un-censored ability to bring out the showgirl in anyone is evident when he explains and teaches!
Add this DVD to your collection,you'll learn a lot about dance based movement while having a great time! Rodney is fabulous!",1326499200,3,435,4.8133333333333335
4073352,2,B00366E1CS,"I tried to do the routine, but this may be for dancers. I had a difficult time keeping up with this routine. It was fast paced and have only tried it once. I am back to doing my Zumba.",1317600000,,184,3.7435897435897436
4073353,5,B00366E1CS,"This is a great video. Be warned that Rodney James may seem outrageous to some, yet it is his extravagancy that makes this instructional video fun to follow and watch. He is more in tune with being feminine many women I know - from the eye-battin' to the struttin'. The video is neither too easy nor too difficult and did I mention that it's fun? I wish it were longer. I want more Rodney James!",1315612800,2,395,4.28
4073354,2,B00366E1CS,"This DVD was okay. Not a big fan. I am really into burlesque and striptease style dance. This video was mostly just a Rodney James sales pitch. He is not sexy in any way, shape, or form. Just plain nasty lol. Like the other review said it's not very feminine but more burly movements. Burlesque is graceful and a art. This was anything but... The man can dance and he can move I just think the DVD would have been alot better if it was a sexy female dancer showing us these moves. He does do counts for you which is nice. You can mix and match routines. Maybe good for a straight beginner but I still see error even it that. Kinda feel like I wasted my $$$ Hopefully there is truly a Burlesque DVD out there we can learn/benefit from dance and work our physique.",1315008000,4,762,4.190476190476191

4073356,3,B00366E1CS,"If you are looking for a low-intensity workout, step right up. There is no fancy footwork, complicated moves or strenuous activity on this DVD. The warm up/stretching portion could be a dance routine by itself. If you are bothered by men in high heeled shoes, move along.",1304208000,,271,4.787234042553192

4073359,5,B00366E1CS,I really liked this dvd. The instruction was very good and not to complex if you are new to this type of dance. It is a bit weird to see a guy performing these moves but he was a great instructor. I do recommend this one.,1288137600,6,221,3.8260869565217392
4073360,5,B00366E1CS,"I purchased this DVD in the hopes of losing weight in time for my wedding. I have not been disappointed yet. Its a fun, sexy workout that is made even more fun by Rodney's bubbly attitude. This DVD really makes burlesque accessible and fun for women of all body types. The warm up alone will make you sweat, though most people will have to repeat the instructional dance sequence a few times to get it down. Its a good thing though, because its a great workout that revs up your cardio and gets you sweating. I would recommend this DVD to anyone.",1287014400,18,546,4.362745098039215
8389563,5,B00366E1CS,"WOW! Received ""Burlesque Beat"" along with ""RAWR with Rodney"" and all I can say is. ""GOD, I LOVE IT!"".

A great fitness DVD for anyone who has been curious to try a chair class (but perhaps too shy to try an in-person class).

Beautiful choreography taught by the SPECTACULAR Rodney James -- Seriously, this guy is a SCREAM!

8389566,3,B00366E1CS,"I want so much to love this DVD just because the instructor is so much fun.  But it has MAJOR flaws.

First of all, I don't know how many times people have to say this, but DO NOT TEACH FACING YOUR AUDIENCE AND SAY ""Go Right"" and MOVE TO YOUR RIGHT!  That's your viewer's left, and most people find it very frustrating to try to process that what they are seeing (instructor moving to the left) with what they are hearing (instructor saying step/move/use  the right) and it makes the learning experience very frustrating.  I'm sorry, but there are SO many reviews on so many DVDs that make this mistake that there is no excuse anymore for this kind of shoddy teaching.  If he can't reverse what he says/does, he shold have been filmed in front of a mirror with his back to the viewer, which is also beneficial because you can see what the person is doing with their body from 2 perspectives AND the instructor doesn't have to remember to reverse (or simply say ""go this way"" and point) verbal instructions with what they are actually doing.

I also thought there would be more workout in this workout.  I have taken chair/floor dance classes and a lot of it was doing moves and perfecting them which was a great workout.  This is more a really brief tutorial masquerading as a workout, and then a lot of learning choreography.  There are NO modifiers for those with knee or back issues, or who just don't have the muscle control about how to get around some of these things, so trying to do the choroeography as a way of extending the ""workout"" is asking for some people to just get hurt.

This DVD is great for someone who wants to learn 2 fairly easy choreographied routines, just as long as you are the kind of learner who can either blot out the verbal instruction or ignore the visual (I am not one of those people and if you tell me to cross my right foot over the left and you don't mirror me, I will trip over my own 2 feet, as will a lot of people, so please, know what kind of learner you are) you might have fun with this video.  The choreographies are cute, but they're more what I think of as strip joint dance than burlesque.  In my mind, burlesque is sexier, has some sort of story (or gimmick) and the tease part is slower.

And Rodney James is just so much fun.  Even though I found myself getting very frustrated with this DVD I found myself wishing I could be one of the women who are behind him on the stage because they would be learning from behind him and getting proper direction.  I liked his personality and admire the fact that he can work the high heels better than most women.  I hope that he gets some good constructive feedback either from Amazon or elsewhere and comes back with a DVD that is easier to follow.",1444953600,,2742,4.334637964774951
