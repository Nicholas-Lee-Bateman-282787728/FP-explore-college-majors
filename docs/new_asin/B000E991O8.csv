8107727,5,B000E991O8,"The Biblical Collector's Series: Biblical Prophecies was very interesting. It gave information about events that are to take place during this time and the times to come. For those that know the bible and want more insight, this series would be good to purchase. For those who are not sure about God's word, this will help you to understand that God do exist and his word is true at all times. View for yourself.",1355875200,5,412,4.581081081081081
