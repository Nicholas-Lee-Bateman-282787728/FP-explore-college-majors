4091925,5,B0038Q9QB2,"In the far future, people have left earth to colonize other planets.  And on two planets, men and women not only live on different worlds, but they also are mortal enemies.  On the eve of the launch of a new mens battleship, a lowly worker sneaks aboard on a dare.  And while he does that, pirates from the female planet board and steal the ship.  And while they are doing that, our hapless worker meets Dita a journeyman pirate pilot who is excited about meeting her first ""alien"".  as she chases him around, a new enemy appears and attacks both sides and the ship decides to warp them to saftey.  when that happens three of the female fighters and one of the mens mechs are transformed into new fighting machines able to merge into new combinations of destruction.  of course now the fun part is how a ship of women and a few guys are going to get back to their homeworlds, without killing each other or having the enemy do it for them.

the animation was sharp, especially  during the combat sequences.  the characters are full of life and the story moves at a good pace, the interaction of the men and women start out as bitter enemies to working as a group and possibly more.  the story was well developed and the history develops at a good pace (the reason why the men and women are on different planets is hilarious, and the true id of the enemy is a real eye opener).  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with action and a bit of romance.  Enjoy.",1304467200,2,1473,4.3321167883211675

4091929,4,B0038Q9QB2,"Just finished watching this all the way through. I enjoyed it and the ending was just the right touch.
 The only thing I didn't like was the OVA disk. Having to read subtitles for me takes me away from working on other things I do while watching a DVD. Since my players are in the Living Room, I feed the output from them to both the TV and computer in the front computer room so I can watch movies there too. This allows me to watch a good movie, etc. and work on computer related items at the same time. With a subtitled DVD, I have to ""glue"" to the monitor and that sort of takes away from other things I've doing. (Besides good titles SHOULD be watched more than once anyway.) That's my only complain re this DVD set. This OVA would have made an excellent way to watch a summary of the series if time was a consideration except for the subtitles.
 Well worth the money otherwise.",1273017600,2,883,4.218934911242603

4091942,5,B0038Q9QB2,"I've been a fan of GONZO's work for some time now, ever since watching their first show Blue Submarine No. 6. They have released many popular anime over the years, but it seems like for some people this one slipped through the cracks. The premise is...unique, to say the lease (two planets at war, each populated only by a single sex), and things just get more bonkers from there. If you look closely, however, beyond the silliness and strangeness there is a shockingly good show to be found.

I hear voices

First of all, if you like your shows in English this show is absolutely incredible in the voice acting department. It's a shining reminder of just how good English dubs got for a while as we have main characters voiced by the people who played:The Major (Ghost in the Shell), Tanya (Battle Athletes Victory), Spike (Cowboy Bebop),  Milly (Trigun), Count Cagliostro (Lupin III:Castle of Cagliostro), Toph (Legend of Korra)....and last but not least...

Rick Hunter from the Robotech Macross Saga!!!!!!!!

I mean seriously, GOOD GRIEF!!!! This HAS to be the greatest voice cast ever assembled!!!!! Er..umm...moving right along...

The characters

Voice actors smoishactors you say? Well these awesome voice actors who could make the stupidest, most shallow character even sound like Shakespeare or Star Wars have some GREAT material to work with. This show has character development for EVERYONE. There are no minor characters here. Absolutely ever character (though some might call them stereotypes) is positively dripping with personality, to the point where it's darn hard not to love absolutely everyone in this show. For the first half of the show, there isn't really much of a plot, but there doesn't need to be one because the English voiced characters just so dang entertaining!

The Story

There actually IS a great story to be found, it's just very convoluted and confusing, and a lot of things aren't really explained at all until halfway through the show. Be patient grasshopper. DO NOT judge this show by the first ""season"" because the story improves drastically, along with everything else once you are into the second half. The characters get more depth, the story gets more fleshed out, and oh yeah...

The Animation

No bones about it, the first half of this show has HORRIBLE CGI that makes it look very low budget. the animation itself is fine (if very computer-assisted looking) but the cell animation and pure CGI blend about as well as oil and water (on Earth). Fortunately, the show seems to get a HUGE animation bump in the second season, to the point where it's almost like watching a different show. And that's really great because...

A Really Great Story

You might have a hard time believing it from the start, but this is a really great story. You have genuinely inspiring speeches, compelling examples of understanding and tolerance (I try to be as patient and understanding as the Doctor), heart-warming devotion, and heart-breaking loss. There is one episode in particular that has a newly introduced character die...that honestly made me cry. Because a character underwent a drastic change as a result of that loss, even though he very briefly knew the character introduced. And if there is one way to describe the style of this show, that would be it. Despite throwing things out you suddenly and between comic silliness, it still makes you CARE.

This show's style is very hyper-active and disjointed. It rapidly cuts between people and locations and everything happens very quickly. There's a lot of planet hopping, fast action, and people talk fast. If you don't like that sort of things and like your anime slow and ponderous this is not the show for you. If you don't mind watching a show where you can just kind of hang on for the ride and have a wild time this is probably more your speed.

Flaws

Needless to say, if you are ultra-conservative this show is going to be all kinds of offensive to you. It doesn't force you to watch anything graphic (heck I think there's like one kiss in the entire series) but there's plenty of innuendo and references to everything from mono-gendered societies (duh!) to religious fanaticism and body-part harvesting. There's also of course tons of fan-service as just about every woman is dressed in a provocative way (which absolutely makes sense if you consider the fact that they were raised on a world with no men to leer at them).

Al that is arguably not a real flaw though. The REAL flaw is that this show is letterboxed, not presented in animorphic widescreen. That means that even if you have a widescreen television like mine, there are still black bars on the top and bottom. Yuck! The show badly needs an animorphic transfer/remaster for that reason alone!

In the End

If you love the great dubs of the 90's on shows like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Battle Athletes Victory, Giant Robo, and the Big O, there is absolutely no excuse not to pick up this show. It is superbly voiced and hilariously entertaining. Highly recommended to fans of 90's anime.",1421712000,2,5042,4.855477855477855

4091960,5,B0038Q9QB2,"Vandread is futuristic sci-fi anime set in a future where men and women are divided between planets in known human-space.  The story follows with the cliche of a boy trying to prove himself before being captured by pirates (which are all women) before being forced to join forces in order to stop an inevitable harvest of all humans within space.
The plot I think is quite good, with those of Earth attempting to sustain themselves by harvesting the bodies of other humans. But, the drawback is that of the hero himself, as his overall relationship with his ""vanguard"" and that of the women of the series is all too cliched and really drowns out much needed drama.  As well, this anime was made well back when computer graphics were in the infancy for anime, so battles and the units themselves look a little outdated compared to now.
But, in all honesty, I enjoyed the series with all its problems and found the final three episodes to really draw the series to a very good conclusion.
Not so much a MUST BUY, but it is entertaining to watch...",1352246400,,1045,4.5828877005347595
4091961,5,B0038Q9QB2,I LOVE Vandread! When I saw it on Hulu I had to buy it and I've never regretted it!

4091962,4,B0038Q9QB2,"This anime isn't much different than some of the other space/harem/comedy stories out there. It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start.",1350777600,2,848,4.66

4091965,4,B0038Q9QB2,"This show surprised me a little because I had zero expectations, but cam away impressed. Story is as presposterous as any sci fi anime, but charatcers are very likable & that's really what kept me watching. This is mostly campy fun with some moments of drama added in (they are in a war after all). The basic premise is men & women have split completely to live on different planets, and are at war with each other. A group of men are captured by a women's warship. After showing some usefulness, they end up working for the women, but are still prisoners to them.

The character Dita stands out as most endearing to me. She has a naive childlike innocence, but more open to her feelings than the rest of the characters. This makes for some great interaction between her & clueless male character Hibiki, who is quite rude to her & doesn't get this male-female relationship thing. The only thing he has been taught about women is they are men's sworn enemy. It is touching and sweet to see Dita trying to win over Hibiki by making little gifts for him, only to get her feelings hurt when our clueless dude doesn't show any appreciation...but we later see how one of these silly little presents seems to have some importance to him. Will Hibiki come around and realize what a precious person Dita is to him, or will he remain a women hating warrior? I'll stop here, and let the viewers find out for themselves.",1332806400,,1409,4.50390625
4091966,4,B0038Q9QB2,"As an anime fan since the mid-90s, I grew to love typical genres - harem, mecha, comedy, romance and first-love stories, mystery, drama and sci-fi - thanks to the amount of anime being shown on TV. Luckily for me, I ended up finding this little gem of a series called ""Vandread"". Even now, this is still one of my all-time favorite series compared to today's current choices of shows.

This series, in my eyes, is one that mixes all of the popular genres into a two-season anime that easily shows many of the popular themes right off the bat. Men and women are on different planets in the near [or is it far?] future, and after a long time apart, a small trio of men end up as the captives of a pirate spaceship filled with women... and hilarity definitely ensues. Okay, so the main situation may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm sure that you'll find one or two characters within the large cast [of mostly women] to personally grow fond of. Many of the major characters are given some good character development with some backstory, and some even manage to take me by surprise once the series dove into Second Stage. I'll admit that I ended up admiring once-annoying characters by the end of the series. There are moments of funny, heartwarming, and maybe even some tearjerker moments too - something that any fan will love.

This complete set is absolutely a great deal for both the first season and Second Stage, as well as for the two never-before-released OVAs. I was disappointed to see that the OVAs were nothing but condensed recaps of each season, but I did like the little additional scenes of filler that didn't make it into the series. The fact that the OVAs only had subtitles was also disappointing, but I didn't mind it much; I enjoyed both the English dub and the subbed versions of the series.

In the end and overall, ""Vandread"" is definitely worth many more viewings and a permanent spot in one's anime collection with this set!",1325548800,13,1952,4.571428571428571
4091967,5,B0038Q9QB2,Loved this show since I first saw it on television. When I found out the entire series was on dvd I almost flipped. The show really details Life how it would be if men and women lived separately then got thrown into doing so. Certainly a must watch!,1318464000,,249,4.208333333333333
4091968,5,B0038Q9QB2,"Vandread is just one of those shows. If you read the manga, it is at times a bit sloppy and it doesn't really fill in much more than the show. The characters cut from that for the show are not missed and the execution is much better in the anime. The show itself fixes a lot of problems from the manga and generally makes you want to watch it again from time to time.

This series gets classified as a harem comedy at times but after watching it, I wouldn't quite classify it as that. There is a harem concept but it is not exploited in Vandread to the fullest. Very much unlike shows like Love Hina where it is clear there is a mass of women all fawning after 1 guy. That said, the characters and setting are quite enjoyable in a Disneyized version of two same sex societies. If you are expecting a fanservice feast, you won't be totally thrilled with Vandread. There is fanservice for sure but it is rather mild compared to other shows.

If a 4.5 star rating could be given, I would. Because it is not perfect. The aspects not quite perfect are simple. It gets a little heavy on psychology aspects later in the show. ""Proving one's existence"" and such. Thankfully it won't leave a horrible sour taste in your mouth but at times you will wish it would just move the story along. Then the second aspect one would complain about kinda ties in with the aforementioned. That is the main protagonist. Hibiki is quite a weak character throughout much of the story. He has his moments but, there just isn't a whole lot to like about him. He is an echo of the Tarak male society but also one which opposes it. These two factors constantly clash, sometimes for the better but often as a jerk. This does affect the harem concept because he is just not a character all women would be drawn to.

In the end, despite it's issues, Vandread is a show you can watch more than once and enjoy. There is some decent CG work done and you can really see a far deeper storyline set in the Vandread universe. The potential is there and it is a shame the storyline was not continued further. When the story ends, it provides very good closure but also shows this potential. Always a good sign. Whether the show gets revisited again or not, who knows. For now, enjoy it for what it is. A fun romp through space with great characters and super Vandread Pyoro!",1311033600,7,2334,4.348623853211009
4091969,3,B0038Q9QB2,"You get both seasons, plus the two specials which are essentially recaps. There's English, Japanese, and subs. I think it's a good series, but people's taste vary. When I bought it on sale for $23 which isn't bad even for a blind buy.

Pretty much my only complaint is that the discs are difficult to remove. Normally to remove discs, you would push down where the hole is, and the disc will pop out. This one was different. It felt like I had to just pull hard and I was actually afraid the disc would snap. It does get better with time, but it shouldn't have to. Other than that, it's a good buy.

3/5 because taking the disc out should be simple. I don't want to be scared of snapping the disc when I feel like watching it.",1305072000,2,726,4.215827338129497

8391679,4,B0038Q9QB2,"Maybe it is the result of the all but incomprehensible anime studio Gonzo, but no matter what you are expecting this series will surprise you.  To begin with it most closely resembles (of all things!)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Voyager/dp/B01NAJ4HMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Voyager</a>: a band of incompatibles are forced together as a single crew in order to successfully journey a long way to their home planets.  The twist is that these human men and women have grown up separately through cloning and initially regard each other as enemies!  (Boy, are they in for a surprise!)

The story begins with the launch of a Taraak (male) converted battleship running into a Mejere (female) pirate ship; in the confusion the oldest part of the Taraak ship is abandoned, but its attempted destruction by the men results in a whole series of Paxsis Pragma controlled incidents: three men are left behind, the pirate ship and the old core are fused together, one Taraak mecha and three Mejere fighters are ""modified"", and the lot of them are wormholed far enough away from home to face a long journey back.  In the process the three men: a skilled doctor and engineer, a cowardly helmsman and navigator, and a heroic idiot of a mecha pilot are gradually worked into the crew by Mejerens out of necessity and with reason enough to doubt the lies taught them by a government they do not trust, having become criminals in the first place in order to survive their own government's stupidity.  What follows are bizarrely alternating scenes of wacky comedy and deadly seriousness.  It is kind of like every anime you've ever seen: lots of drama and stress over having no sex with each other; the difference is that these characters don't know why there is all that drama and stress in the first place!

Defects?  Well, the regular animation is nothing to write home about, and the computer animation is blatantly obvious, both signs of its age.  In addition while the motivations of the central villains make a certain kind of sense, the motivations of many of the lesser, unintentional villains who did so much to create the situation make no sense at all.  In addition the main hero is something of a blithering idiot, faithfully supported by the long-suffering ditz of a main heroine, who take up too much attention in contrast to far more interesting secondary characters.

Finally, while the inclusion of the two season summarizing OVA's, but subtitled only, on disc 5 might seem a useless excess, there is method to the madness because the extra effort to explain the main plot in the much shorter OVA's clears away much (though not all) of the confusion left from watching the TV series.  For once at least it is definitely worth watching both.
