2875824,5,B000RW3YZO,Great stuff!  really enjoyed the 'never b4 seen' material. Definitely a 'must have' for any who considers themselves a 49er Faithful! Only wish each dvd was more than a hr. long.  But will be sure to watch these over & over; so glad NFL put this pkg. together.  Only other dislike: WHY wasn't Joe narrating/interviewed???,1194134400,,321,4.8
2875825,3,B000RW3YZO,"This was a great set for Niners fans looking to catch up on a little niners history. Each DVD flowed well and had some great commentary by some of the great niners. Only problems I saw was that some of the same footage was used in each of the DVD's. It only happend a couple of times but it made the DVD's seem rushed through production. My wife and I loved this set. It was like watching Rocky 1-5.

Amazon says it's widescreen but my set came standard.",1192320000,7,454,4.159090909090909
2875826,5,B000RW3YZO,"I bought this set for my father, a long-time 49er fan like myself.  However, I ended up liking the programs much more than he did.  Dad is more interested in WHAT happened (games, plays, stats), but I am more drawn to the overall story of WHY those things happened, and how one thing led to another with each of these championship teams.  That is the strength of these programs:  Steve Sabol's genius was his ability to wrap all of the events into an overall narrative that is truly compelling for someone who loves both the game and the story.",1390521600,,544,4.4646464646464645
2875827,5,B000RW3YZO,My son in law is a huge 49ers fan. He was thrilled to get this for Christmas! He's watching it right now!,1388361600,,105,3.8181818181818183
2875828,5,B000RW3YZO,Simply put.  This is a must have for any 49ers fan from any generation.  Can't wait til the next comes out.,1378771200,,107,4.0476190476190474
2875829,5,B000RW3YZO,this brought back great memories of a great football team who won five super bowls a must for any 49ers fan,1374883200,,107,4.142857142857143
2875830,5,B000RW3YZO,Can you ever have too many 49er dvd's?  No.  This is a nice addition to a big collection of 49er videos.,1370390400,,104,3.9047619047619047
2875831,5,B000RW3YZO,"I am not a rabid 49er fan (don't shoot me) but I do like them and I did find them entertaining.  I liked George Siefert, Bill Walsh, Joe Montana, Steve Young, and the rest of the team.  I wanted a little entertainment and back story on the team from the good ol' days.  This DVD did not disappoint me.  If you want to rewatch the games, then this DVD is not what you want.  The DVD provides interesting commentary from the players and coaches and a surprising amount of video from team meetings. It is totally worth the cost.",1368748800,,525,4.262626262626263
2875832,5,B000RW3YZO,I bought these just in case my team didn't get to the dance! now I'll need to purchase the 6 ring set. I did watch one disc so far so good!,1358726400,,139,3.5161290322580645
2875833,5,B000RW3YZO,"The product arrived fast and was of great quality, no complaints here.  I have nothing else to say, it was perfect.",1340928000,,115,4.476190476190476
2875834,5,B000RW3YZO,"Having lived with a life-long Niner fan I wasn't sure if this would be enough for him, but he is so pleased that I am sure I have won 'wife of the year'.  He loves the whole collection of games on this video and the clips; excellent interviews and old school footage.  He is a happy camper, and I thank you all for your previous reviews for helping me decide to purchase this. Winning!!!",1331510400,,387,4.216216216216216
2875835,5,B000RW3YZO,"All of these ""America's Game"" series are absolutely spectacular.  I've purchased several sets (Giants, Cowboys, Broncos, etc) and every single one has been simply outstanding.  NFL Network does a great job with all their stuff, but this series definitely tops the cake!",1325289600,,269,5.380952380952381
2875836,5,B000RW3YZO,"My boyfriend is a 49er fan and thanks to him i'm a fan now too, I was hoping this would be a good Chrismast present & it turned out to be the BEST present for him (and myself too LOL). He loved this dvd collection & one of the things that he mention was, ""this is what I always wanted & I didn't even know it"" We enjoyed all of the dvds and we think that this was made with passion and it really showed how grate the 49ers were. On a funny note, one of the other reviews by a guy said something like, ""it would have you in man tears"" at 1st my boyfriend laughed at this reivew but when we watched it, he did have some man tears in his eyes & said that the guy was right about the tear thing LOL.",1293753600,,695,3.767123287671233
2875837,5,B000RW3YZO,The inside stories of one of the best dynasties ever.  Watch over and over again.,1282521600,,81,4.4
2875838,5,B000RW3YZO,Great Videos! NFL Films best ever production: America's Game.  The 49ers videos are awesome and worth every penny.  Incredible if you love the 49ers! It is a must have for all 49er fans.,1280448000,7,186,4.606060606060606
2875839,5,B000RW3YZO,"The first disc documenting the first super bowl team is worth the
entire set. The commentators are Ronnie Lott, Randy Cross, and
Dwight Clark. They give a review of the entire season as
to how the team developed during the season to the final goal
of winning the championship.",1274572800,5,276,4.653061224489796
2875840,5,B000RW3YZO,"These DVD's were great.  Love the narration and the former player interviews as they gave their own story, reminded me of current events and what they were feeling at the time.  My 8 year old son watches these DVD's all the time, and now knows how great Joe Montana, Dwight Clark, Ronnie Lott, Roger Craig, Randy Cross etc were.",1269561600,,328,4.5423728813559325
2875841,5,B000RW3YZO,"The ""America's Game"" series are quite possibly the best work from NFL Films and that would really be saying something.
This particular DVD set features the greatest Super Bowl franchise ever and football's winningest team the last 25 years,the 49ers.
Chances are you have seen these on the NFL network and may have recorded them like I did,but there are two reasons to purchase the DVDs anyway. Besides the obvious reason that the DVDs are going to look sharper,there is bonus material on these that isn't shown on the NFL Network.
Each DVD contains relevant segments in accordance to the seasons which is always a nice treat to see.",1263945600,,633,4.81651376146789
2875842,5,B000RW3YZO,"This series is awesome!
Love your team?
Know your team?
Watch this!

The only downside is no new championships to talk about!",1228780800,,125,4.681818181818182
2875843,4,B000RW3YZO,"I grew up watching the 49ers and I remember them getting creamed by the Vikings - I wasn't old enough to really know about their first 2 titles.  It was very nostalgic but a bit short.  One thing that I did like were some of the behind the scenes perspectives.  Although I do agree with some others, I have 49er highlight tapes - the ones that are the review of the season and I'm dying to get DVD copies.",1212969600,,405,4.10126582278481
2875844,4,B000RW3YZO,"If you've never seen any of the America's Game episodes then you are missing out.  This is by far a very different NFL films product - much less of the frustrating super slow motion footage and more about the actual games themselves.

This particular product is a must-have for any 49ers fan.  The 1981 DVD in particular is outstanding, but all 5 DVDs are of very high quality.  One of the unique aspects of this set of DVDs is how they each compliment each other, and basically recap the franchise between the years 1979-1994.  For example, the 1984 DVD picks up where the 1981 DVD left off, and talks about how the 49ers didn't make the playoffs in 1982 and lost in the NFC Championship game in '83.

The DVD also faithfully re-caps the Quarterback controversy of 1988, which brings me to the only bad thing I can say about this collection; the absence of Joe Montana.  NFL films uses enough stock footage of previous Montana interviews to keep fans satisfied, but much like the fantastic Dennis Georgatos book Game Of My Life, Montana's absence is the only noticeable flaw, but a glaring one at that.

Is this enough to recommend against purchase?  Of course not!!  Even die-hard 49er (and NFL) fans will be reminded of some awesome highs and a few of the lows which they may have forgotten about.

My final example illustrates the in-depth nature of the DVDs:  during the 1984 season San Fransisco went 18-1.  Their one loss during the season?  Week 7 against the Steelers.  At the end of the game Pittsburgh was driving for the win, but San Fransisco was able to stop them on downs at the goaline, but on the 4th down play, Ronnie Lott was called for a penalty which, although later shown to be a bad call, gave Pittsburgh a fresh set of downs and helped them win the game.  The DVD includes all of this footage, from the actual broadcast, but it doesn't unnecessarily dwell on mundane details.  My point is that each DVD is packed with information, but they keep up a good pace to keep the audience entertained.",1207785600,32,2017,4.542936288088643
2875845,5,B000RW3YZO,If your a San Francisco 49er fan then you will love this dvd set! It takes you back to those great years with interviews from some of the players of those Super Bowl teams and video highlights of the season all the way into the Super Bowl.

8202712,1,B000RW3YZO,"Horrible, I got a completely different dvd then this one. It was still 49ers superbowl but a completely different dvd. I saw it as false advertisement. There not worthy of one star. I'll never buy from them again and they never answered me back from my complaint.",1483056000,,263,4.617021276595745
8202713,5,B000RW3YZO,"The same review I submitted for the ""Steelers"" DVD applies to the DVD for the ""49ers.""  Actually, regarding sports DVDs, I find them all fascinating; interesting; informative & very entertaining because I love history & I love hearing the commentary from the people who are enduring all of these different experiences. The DVD's are allowing fans to be a part of something great; facts & footage straight from the players & coaches mouths; what's better than that?  I'm happy somebody came up with the idea to offer these DVDs to the public for sale because I love them!",1458086400,,570,4.8061224489795915
