8225939,4,B000WWCV30,"If you want a character study of people in war, this is a good one.  The Germans have occupied a village in Belarus,  mingling some with the townfolk.  A young SS officer, Franz, is under the thumb of a cold commander, whose savagery is just beneath the surface.  Franz meets a startlingly beautiful peasant, Polina, with whom he has a flirtatious and rather innocent relationship.  Though the commander implies he can rape the girl if he wants, Franz courts her gently even though they do not share a language.  When an unexplained military operation begins - the massacre of the entire village - Franz is forced to choose, deserting his unit to flee with Polina.  Suddenly, their roles are reversed:  he is the vulnerable one, she the protector.  This is where their love blooms briefly as they are threatened by bitterly angry partisans, join a group of refugees in great danger during the volatile operations about them, and finally Franz meets an implacable enemy as he struggles to save his wounded lover.

I found the film quite powerful.  The war is a backdrop, the immediate situation largely unexplained.  Slowly, the characters of the protagonists are revealed, leading to a frightening climax.  I would recommend this for a portrayal of man in extreme circumstances that is well acted and vivid.",1453075200,,1307,4.9132420091324205
8225940,5,B000WWCV30,"Bjelorussia 1943, A German SS unit is billeted in a small village. Frantz stays together with an older Sergeant in the home of Paulina's mother. Besides the Paulina, the mother and the 2 German soldiers there is nobody else living in the building. Paulina's father and brother are with the partisans in the surrounding forests. Paulina's mother takes good care of all inhabitants like mothers do with love and compassion. Good that she can't understand the older sergeant's prejudices. Hitlers propanganda maschine instructed the German soldiers to treat Russian peasants like untermenschen (subhumans). Not all German soldiers bought those lies, and Frantz is one of them. The sergeant clearly displays some insecurities regarding this policy. Those insults are merely lost, because there is a language barrier. Frantz seems to ignore his sergeants opinions, and starts to flirt with Paulina. The sergeant is not a brute or brawler, more a prisoner of the time. He has a good site, shown when he fixes mechanical devices in the house, like an old defective watch. Everything seems very peaceful at first, until the order arrives, that the village has to fall victim to the ""burnt earth"" strategy of the retreating Wehrmacht. What happens now, would be a spoiler to tell. I just covered the first 10 minutes of the movie above, what's gonna unfold is a heartwrenching , very suspenseful, and actionpacked development. Americans would probably describe it as COME AND SEE (idi i smotry) meets ROMEO & JULIET. That's all I want to give away about this incredible story. The photography is very beautiful, viewers will be surprised, how beautiful the location is, where the movie was being made. As a Canadian, almost all of the actors where unknown to me, but they did a superb job. Specially the mother impressed me the most. I do not think that Hollywood could have pulled out a story like this with this much decency and true to life performances. No formula's , not the run of the mill yarn, just a very good story. I was captivated and glued to this film. Russia new wave cinema is the future !",1322870400,,2097,4.893258426966292
8225941,3,B000WWCV30,"Do not see this film if you are looking for a serious film about the German invasion of Russia. At times,  this is a somewhat lighthearted film about a young SS soldier who loves a young Belarus girl. At the beginning of the film, he and other SS soldiers are living among the Russians, waiting for the order to burn down the village and to kill all the villagers. When the killing starts, the young soldier kills his superior officer to save the life of his girlfriend's mother. Afterwards, he gets rid of his uniform and wears the clothing of his girlfriend's brother, who is now a partisan. There is a lot more to the film, of course,  but I wish it had been addressed the more serious aspects of the German invasion, instead of just using it as a backdrop for a ""Romeo and Juliet"" story.",1253491200,,791,4.374149659863946
