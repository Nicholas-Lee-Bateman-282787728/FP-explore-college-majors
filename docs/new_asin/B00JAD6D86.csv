8649359,5,B00JAD6D86,"MILL CREEK has made available thousands of vintage tv programs that are now in the public domain. This is how they're able to sell these sets at such low prices. It also means that we can once again see programs unaired for decades. If you're looking for any sort of ""HI DEF' restoration, you won't find it on any of these sets. It would make these wonderful collections impossible to assemble at prices easily affordable. My only problem with MILL CREEK that they repackage the collections and pass them off as new when they have been previously included in other format packaging. This could make for duplications of a lot of material you may already have. Read the blurbs carefully.",1480896000,4,685,4.716666666666667
