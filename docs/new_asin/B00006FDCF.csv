1750430,4,B00006FDCF,"I feel that the keys to success in this film are the acting and script. It is one hell of an accomplishment on both areas. The film serves as a black comedy, an exciting action flick, and a thrilling crime caper. It has some great singular roles as well. Brad Pitt is hilarious as stoner Floyd, Christopher Walken is wonderful as the anti-christ, and you can't forget Gary Oldman as wanna-be-black- pimp Drexle.
The writing is hilarious and rich with thoughtful dialogue. It is one hell of a twist at the end. Make dibs on who gets out of the shoot out alive!!!!
Great flick, and fun for a Saturday afternoon. the DVD is fabulously souped-up and impressive. It is definitely worth the money.",1037145600,,691,4.580645161290323

1750432,5,B00006FDCF,"'True Romance' was written by one of the best writer/director's of all time...Quentin Tarantino. He did a very nice job with the writing. The casters put a pretty good cast in it, too. Especially with Patricia Arquette. She was good as Christian Slater's love interest. Christian Slater was good, too. He was also good in 'Interview With The Vampire' (Also with Brad Pitt).
Well, the story is about a man named Clarence (Christian Slater) who falls in love with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). Alabama tells Clarence that she wants to go away somewhere and that all of her stuff is at her Pimp (Gary Oldman)'s place. He goes there and he kills him. He asks another hooker to get Alabama's stuff, and she does. But when Clarence brings it to Alabama she opens it, but it's not her stuff. It's a suitcase full of coke! So they go across country to get help from Clarence's friend Dick to hide from the mob. Then, the mob comes, and it's a whole mess! And the rest, well, you have to go go and see it...",1027123200,,1015,4.462365591397849

1750479,3,B00006FDCF,"I don't like movies that make me feel, half-an-hour in, that I might like this -- if I were a different kind of person.  I was muttering that after seeing ""True Romance"" recently, and a Tarantino fan overheard me.  This is what followed:

TF:  What d'you mean ""different'? How ""different""?

ME: Um . . . younger?

TF:  Oh, you mean like ""immature""?

ME: Your word, not mine.

TF:  And what's with that 3-star OR 5-star rating?  You can't do that, dude!  It's like . . . messin' with Amazon's head.

ME:  All I meant was that I think the movie is exactly what Tarantino and Tony Scott set out to make.  On its own terms, it totally works, man. Kinetic, frenetic -- but I just don't like its terms?

TF: Why the [heck] not!!

ME:  These were cartoon characters!  I like human beings in my movies -- and Tarantino can write them if he wants to.  Look at ""Jackie Brown.""

TF:  Dude, that's so NOT a real Tarantino movie.

ME: If you say so.  Quentin might disagree.

TF: Was there nothin' that you LIKED about it?

ME:  There were some things.  The best scene was the Dennis Hopper-Christopher Walken conversation -- people actually talking to one another, and it made a nice change of pace. Also, two old pros (though not too old in 1993) obviously having fun.  And two briefer things -- Brad Pitt's turn as Floyd, the stoner room-mate, and the very brief scene of Michael Rapaport's audition for a small part in ""T. J. Hooker.""  And it was touching, though irrelevant to the movie, to see James Gandolfini looking fit and good.  Tarantino's writing in ""Jackie Brown"" was superb, but here, apart from the Walken-Hopper scene, the emphasis was on pace and visual glitz, not on dialogue.  And it didn't help that I saw ""Pather Panchali"" last night.

TF:  You're weirdin' me out, man.

ME: Gettin' old.",1454371200,,1796,4.50625

My Man, Christain Slater was right on as was Val Kilmer.  Brad Pitt was never better!",1376956800,,421,4.148148148148148
1750589,5,B00006FDCF,"One of Tarantino's early scripts, 'True Romance' was further enhanced by Director Tony Scott's artistic touch. This film contains a who's-who cast that includes: Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldham, James Gandolfino, Samuel L. Jackson, Christian Slater, Rosanna Arquette, Bronson Pinochet, Tom Sizemore, Christopher Penn, Brad Pitt, and Val Kilmer. When Slater's boss hires a call-girl (Arquette) named Alabama to 'pick up' his employee and ask him on date as a birthday present, the two fall madly in love. Discovering the truth, Slater's character, Clarence, decides to extricate her from the clutches of her pimp (one very scary looking Gary Oldham). When Slater shoots his way out of that situation, he and Alabama discover that he inadvertently picked up a suitcase full of cocaine. They plan to leave the area and turn the drugs into a cash nest-egg for themselves. Unbeknownst to them, the drugs really belong to a local, but powerful mob boss and the mayhem continues to build from there.

The film is quite notable for two integral scenes, the first being known as the 'Sicilian Scene', where Christopher Walken's character confronts Clarence's estranged Dad (Dennis Hopper) over the couple's whereabouts; and the hotel scene where hit-man, Gandolfini, encounters a not-so-meek Alabama. Other endearing quirks in this film include Clarence's random conversations with Elvis (Val Kilmer); and  Brad Pitt's performance as a stoned out roommate.

While not an Oscar winner, this film has gained a bit of a cult status and is also notable for furthering the careers of many of the cast members. Watching Gandolfini's character in this, it is easy to spot the beginnings of what would become his Tony Soprano character in HBO's 'The Sopranos' Gary Oldman's rendition of the wild drug dealing pimp, Drexel, is also remarkable. Christopher Walken is always a joy to watch, and he delivers a menacing performance here as a restrained, but ill tempered mob enforcer. All-in-all, 'True Romance' is not your average love film, nor is it your average crime drama, but it manages to mix both of those with just the right amount of levity to make this worth watching if you want something other than the standard Hollywood fare.

The Special Edition includes a second disc with many extras, including deleted scenes and an alternate ending - all worth checking out if you enjoyed the movie.",1374537600,5,2396,5.151670951156812

The first set I recieved had 2 discs:
Disc one (which was clearly marked ""Disc 1"") with the movie and commentaries on it

and

Disc two (which was clearly marked ""Disc 2"")that was supposed to contain the bulk of the extra features - you know the reason you would would buy this set to start with.

Here in lies the rub: Disc 2 is identical to disc 1 - except for its label.  Okay so mistakes can happen. I sent it back the defective setand was sent a replacement set with no problem

EXCEPT,

Same thing, the replacement set I recieved had two discs, disc one and disc two with identical content, NO extra features.

Simple logic would suggest that there are probably hundreds maybe thousands of these bogus sets out there.

Since most everyone knows the story and has probably heard that it's a great film in all ways, the only thing I can add is that if you purchase the Two-disc special edition, it comes in a nice Collector's type package which looks good and is practical in size. I can't say the Second Disc has anything special on it, but is interesting enough if you want to know a little more about certain actors and hear their thoughts and memories. I purchased this for the movie alone and was pleasantly surprised to find the extra disc for what I paid and the nice package, even though I don't leave my DVDs in their original case unless it's something like this set.

1750751,4,B00006FDCF,"Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" (1994) is a cocktail mixture of action, drugs, sex and violence rollicking with the heedless enthusiasm of a newborn puppy in a Christmas box. The plot is a miasma of over-the-top situations centering on a comic store clerk and a call girl who fall in love and set about making their mark in the world. The murder of the call girl's pimp and the re-appropriation of his drug stash allow this dynamic duo to attain their dreams, but not without some bumps along the way.

Scripted by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary, the film exists in a high-octane and bullet-riddled universe where paper-thin characters thrive with no sense of nagging morality or long term purpose. The viewer never knows what Clarence (Slater) or Alabama (Arquette) want to be, other than a mad dog killer and a gorgeous hooker, or even what they want to do, other than have sex in phone booths and watch Kung Fu movies. In fact, their long-term goal of ""getting far, far away"" throughout the film is revealed as spending money, making love and lying around on tropical beaches. Does this make the film not worth seeing? No: Quite the opposite.

Once the viewer realizes he is not watching a realistic film but instead a film written for twenty-something college dorm inhabitants, the film can be enjoyed for what it is: an entertaining action movie with lots of crazy dialog, fast-paced antics and bloody situations.

The two stars, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, are ideally cast for their roles. Slater effortlessly conveys the bored-out-of-his-mind young man who hasn't grown up and spends his time clerking at a comic book store. As the peppy hooker, Arquette's performance encapsulates the Playboy nymph of a male teendom's dreams: the breezy gal you hope would crash at your pad for a week in Daisy Duke Shorts and halter tops.

The best performances in the film are by Val Kilmer, unrecognizable as the imaginary Elvis, and Brad Pitt, who bumbles along as the stoned-beyond-all-reason roommate that is all too eager to give directions. Dennis Hopper gives a mostly by-the-numbers performance with the exception of a tense yet hilarious speech delivery on Sicilian genetics. Christopher Walken instantly tops the speech and calmly egresses with his usual cool. The icing on the cake is the talented Gary Oldman as a psychotic drug-dealing wacko-path who rants about White Boy Day and is the epitome of urban mayhem.

If you are bored on a Saturday night then I suggest you rent ""True Romance"" and let the chaotic genius of Tarantino Land wash over you.

1750763,5,B00006FDCF,"It had been quite a while since I had seen True Romance - my VHS tape warped - and I had forgotten just how good it is.
That said, those who have never seen it should be warned that the film is what a friend of mine calls ""HARD R-rated"". In other words, it is explicit in every sense of an R-rated movie.
The director's cut has few changes that I noticed from the VHS edition I had, with one very noticeable and effective change in the final shootout scene. It is a decided improvement,
The best thing about the two-disk set is all the special features. Those who do not enjoy commentary won't have a lot to cheer about but those who do will be ecstatic. After watching the movie straight through the night the package came in the mail, I went back and watched the individual commentaries on specific scenes by some of the stars-in-smaller-roles such as Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt. Then I watched the deleted or altered scenes with commentary by director Tony Scott. That was terrific. I loved hearing him say things such as, ""I wish I'd left that in."" A couple of times I wished he had, too.
Then I went back and picked scenes to re-watch with commentary by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. Every minute of sleep lost to this marathon was worth it.
Once again, this is not a film for anyone who is offended by four-letters words, graphic violence or blatant sex. I wish that it were less in-your-face R so that I could recommend it to a wider audience. Nevertheless, the acting is flawless, direction on target and some scenes are absolutely brilliant.

I have 3 favorite movies because they are movies with a spirit that refuses to die.  I won't go into the details with my top 2 but True Romance PACKS A PUNCH.  I think most men have at least one time fallen in love with a girl stuck in some real messes that we never freed them from.  Clarence (the main character) had such a good time with this call girl that he didn't care about her profession.  They had a true connection.  And when she says ""from this moment forth I promise I will never lie to you again"", that is the turning point for him.  He has to free her from her fears to let her realize he'll protect her from anything.  ""You don't know me.  Not when it comes to $#it like this.""

1750802,5,B00006FDCF,You must know what this movie is about from all the other reviewers so i'll just coment on this dvd.  The quality of this dvd is excellent.  Great sound and visual.  Many extras.  It's very much worth the price.  Quentin Tarantino wrote the script and Tony Scott directed it.  Do I dare say it is a masterpiece?  It is to me.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give oscar worthy performances.  I love it!!,1175126400,,410,4.506849315068493
1750803,5,B00006FDCF,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and in my opinion Quentin Tarantino's best. There are so many reasons why this is an excellent movie, but I don't want to rave on so I will try to summarize.

Patricia Arquette's performance in this movie is so amazing, very visceral and primal, as well as funny. I believe that this movie was her swan song, the best performance she has ever done. The same applies to Gary Oldman's performance. His characterization of Drexyl the wannabee black man is mesmerizing and primal. Then there is Brad Pitt's superb cameo as a pot head roomate, which is just hilarious.

These are just the highlights, there are many, many more astounding performances and characters in this movie. Hugely entertaining roller-coaster ride with real substance!",1172275200,5,780,4.9465648854961835
1750804,4,B00006FDCF,"As Quentin Tarantino mentions in his commentary, True Romance was a script he wrote that he tried to get made for a long time. Desperate, he sold it and used the money to make Reservoir Dogs, his first film. Director Tony Scott, known for Top Gun, Days of Thunder and Enemy of the State directed it instead and in a weird way i's like a Tarantino film he didn't make. It may not be everyone's cup of tea and diehard fans of Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction probably won't be replaying this over and over but it did have its fans and it's thankfully a cult film that's worth watching.

Clarence is a Elvis loving, Sonny Chiba movie-watching comic book store employee who meets Alabama and very quickly falls in love. However, Alabama is a call girl with a crazy pimp named Drexl. Clarence hates the idea and goes over and causes some ruckus and leaves with a random suitcase, thinking it's Alabama's things. Only opening it, they find 200,000$ worth of uncut cocaine and decide to go to California to find a buyer. Problem is mobsters want that suitcase and cops will also stumble on it and Clarence and Alabama are caught right in the middle.

While originally having Tarantino's trademark non-linear structure, the film undeniably feels like a Quentin movie but oddly it's almost a more subdued movie. Instead of Pulp Fiction where everything is big one-liners and witty dialogue one right after another, it's more humanistic and honest with some funny quips thrown in. It's one of my favorite things about the film in that it's not some big witty line extravaganza which something like From Dusk Till Dawn became. It's more character driven much like Jackie Brown and it's all the better for it.

Casting is quite spot-on and pretty impressive too with Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman in a funny performance, Val Kilmer as Elvis, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. If there is a flaw to the film is that at the halfway mark the film still maintains interest but not at the level the first half did. That's all remedied with probably one of my favorite Mexican standoff/shootout scenes I've seen with a whole ****load of feathers flying around. Also, it's almost as if some of the focus is away from Clarence and Alabama for awhile but the film still maintains an interest, just not on a bigger caliber.

Will you like it? Hard to say, many people love it while others didn't so best advice is to just try it out.",1169942400,4,2443,4.661252900232019
1750805,5,B00006FDCF,"Christian Slater stars as a lovable loser named Clarence.  He works in a comic book shop.  When goes to see his traditional birthday feature by himself, his boss secretly hires a call girl to meet up with him.  She a beautiful blond named Alabama (Patricia Arquette), and Clarence can hardly believe it when she stumbles (literally actually) into his life.  Alabama soon admits that while she was paid initially, she's since fallen for him.  Clarence proffesses his love back, and they set out to start a new life together.  But this leads to the real issue of dealing with Alabama's brutal pimp.  When Clarence kills him, it sets off a cross country chase involving drugs, gangsters and the inevitable mayhem.

Now, the first thing I'd like to say is I think that Quentin tarantino is the real star of this film.  He wrote the script, and it's got his trademark mix of violence, humour and references to ""junk"" culture.  He only sold the screenplay in order to finance ""Reservoir Dogs"".

Personally, I enjoyed ""True Romance"" alot.  But it's got some flaws one has to fess up to.  It's filled with a number of cliches, stock characters, and plot twists that if you think too much about...don't reall hold water.  That said, if you're able to suspend your disbelief a bit, it's a very fun movie.  It has a great fairy tale typle feel.  It has an AMAZING ensemble cast....You'll see Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Val Kilmer, brad Pitt and more.  Many of them before they broke it big career wise.
Anyway...to wrap this up, I'll recommend it you in this way:  If you liked Quentin Tarantino's other films--such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'--and if you're willing to suspend your disbelief a bit...You should definitely see it.",1168905600,3,1788,4.8256578947368425

It's got Patricia Arquette at her sexiest. It's got a tour de force confrontation between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, all venom and sarcasm, all played to the tune of The Flower Duet. It's got great dialogue. It's got movie geekiness. It's got slam bang violence. And it's written by Quentin Tarantino. If you haven't seen this, it's your loss. For my money, this is the most romantic film ever. What he does for her... and what she does for him in return... that's true love. No sugar-coated stuff. Hard edged, gritty reality where romance and sweetness are highly unlikely to surface and thrive. But they do. In a way only the genius of Tarantino can get away with.

1750808,4,B00006FDCF,"This is a prime time Tarantino story with a superb cast and great music. I have no idea why I came across this fun movie only now, it seems to have been overlooked and underrated when it came out in 93. Obviously it is much too violent and the language is definitely obscene. As I said, that's entertainment. Very entertaining.

Slater and Arquette as a very romantic and very naive couple getting dragged into gang trouble over stolen drugs, that they try to sell, are entirely plausible in their wide eyed romance. My favorite among the smaller parts is Walken, who is, as usual, a very very bad guy, but so elegantly and charmingly here. Hopper for once is a nice person, which does not get him very far in the story. Oldman and Pitt have small freak parts, which they fill in nicely.

One question comes up: there are half a dozen great male roles here, but practically only one woman, other than extras. Must mean something, but what?

1750809,5,B00006FDCF,"I never watched this film until it was released on video. And I was greatly impressed, not only with the acting, but the writing as well. This is an excellent and very underrated film. This is the first film that I saw the adult Christian Slater in [The exception being ""The Name Of The Rose""]. I was totally impressed with his character and acting. But not just him, everybody was good in this film. Even some of the character actor's I usually don't like were outstanding. The film's narrative follows the life of Clarence (Christian Slater) and his recent girlfriend Alabama (Patricia Arquette). Alabama is a prostitute who works for a very mean SOB.

Moreover, Clarence decides to buy her freedom [very funny and violent part] which I will leave for you to watch. (Gary Oldman) portrays her pimp, and his encounter with Clarence is where the film takes off. When getting Alabama, he takes a suitcase filled with cocaine. However, this cocaine belongs to the mob. Enter (Christopher Walken), a former mob hitman, and presently well-known mob gangster. He is tough, as are his acquaintances. They are after Clarence [he is unaware of this]. Clarence decides to go to California, but first talks to his father (Dennis Hopper). Hopper's interaction with Walken is great, and to divulge it would ruin it for those of you who have not seen the film. Let's just say events don't work out between the two of them.

Therefore, with the mob hot on his trail, Clarence and Alabama head to California, where a friend of Clarence is going to try and hook him up with a buyer. This plot thickens as drug enforcement agents bust a friend of Clarence's friend. Deciding to avoid a long jail term, this friend of his friend (Bronson Pinchot) turns informents. (Christopher Penn) plays one of the drug agents, and he plays the role great. Also, (Saul Rubinek) is the hollywood director, who is also the purchaser of the drugs. He is fantastic in his role. [And funny too!] (Tom Sizemore) is Penn's partner and he is really great in his role too. What you eventually have is a meeting of all the concerned parties in one hell of a convergence. This film is highly recommended. Very suspenseful, and wonderfully written plot make this a 5 star film! Highly Recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1160611200,5,2265,4.746192893401015

Christian Slater playing Clarence Worley, a comic book store employee is set up with a new to the profession call girl Alabama played by a very sexy Patricia Arquette as a birthday present.  They quickly get married and Slater wants to sever her ties with her scarfaced and dreadlocked pimp Drexl Spivey played by Gary Oldman.

Amazed at his good fortune they plan to go to L.A. to sell the coke and live happily ever after.  Unfortunately the organized crime owners of the drugs led by Mafia don Vincenzo Coccotti played by the always peculiar Christopher Walken have other plans.

The film with a terrific cast including Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Samuel L.

""True Romance"" may very well be in the top ten of greatest action films of all time ranging in the same category as such classics as ""Leon: The Professional, John Woo's The Killer, The Matrix"" and so on.

Christian Slater plays his role of a down and out comic book salesman and kung fu movie lover fantastically as he celebrates his birthday alone by getting a beer and going to the movies.

In walks Patricia Arquette who instantly ignites passion and clicks through to Christian's true character. They experience their first night together and are immediately in love - hense True Romance.

Before the mobster storyline takes place, you really appreciate these two people who in the whole mess of life and experiences, find true romance between each other and make anyone who watches this wish they could have such a love in their life.

From beginning to end you are entranced in first the wonderful dialogue that Christian and Patricia exchange and follow up with hitting the road, then as you are beginning to settle in the love story, in crashes Christopher Walken as a head mobster and rolls out with co-star Dennis Hopper once the most brutal but spectacular scenes in film history (you will know when you see it).

The performances are splendid by all, and the extreme violence make this Bonnie and Clyde type of movie all the more enjoyable.

The only thing I did not like about this director's cut, but can still be seen elsewhere in the disc set, are the deleted scenes. This is the rare movie in which all the scenes that were deleted, should have actually remained in the movie.

And the scene with Virgil (James Gandolfini, ever the perfect mobster, even before Sopranos), the henchman, & Alabama -- I could watch this movie over & over again just for those 2 scenes alone.  Alabama is, by no means, the meek damsel in distress waiting for her hero to ride in for the rescue -- to protect her man, there are no holds barred!

1750882,4,B00006FDCF,"""True Romance"" is a very good film, but it did not recieve the acclaim it should have (and eventually did) when it premiered in 1993. Only on video (and now on dvd) did ""True Romance"" really find it's audience and especially after the world wide acclaim of the now classic ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 did many people discover this gem of a script by Quentin Tarantino [which was Tarantino's first completed script]. Tony Scott (Top Gun, Revenge) directs this film, as mostly all of his films, with a lot of face-paced, colorful style. But here he shows his passion for it's story and especially the main characters of Clarence and Alabama as he follows them on their romantic and dangerous journey together.

Clarence and Alabama are portrayed by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, who make an excellent couple in this film. Clarence is a lonely comic book store clerk who meets Alabama, a free-spirited call girl. They fall in love and get married, however, thoughts of Alabama's now ex-pimp, Drexyl (Gary Oldman) is nawing at Clarence's conscience deciding whether or not he should kill him. Indeed, he does kill Drexyl, and in the process, unknowingly takes the wrong suitcase which turns out to be filled with cocaine. Clarence and Alabama plan to sell the cocaine, take the money and run, but little do they know that the mobsters who that suitcase of cocaine belongs to and the cops desperate for a bust are after them.

Along the way are a suitcase full of supporting actors including Dennis Hopper as Clarence's father, Christopher Walken as the mob boss and James Gandolfini as his brutal henchman, Michael Rappaport as Clarence's best friend Dick Ritchie, Brad Pitt as Dick's very laid back roommate, Val Kilmer as Clarence's mentor (Elvis), Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as the vice cops, Bronson Pinchott as an actor and middle man for a Hollywood producer (Saul Rubinek) interested in buying Clarence and Alabama's cocaine. All of these supporting performances are great and work very well with Tarantino's unique dialogue with the exception of Brad Pitt as Floyd, Dick's stoner roommate. Pitt (early in his career) adds a lot more to this 'cameo' character than Tarantino's script, and he does it very well.

This film is romantic and violent at the same time contrasting ""Bonnie and Clyde"" which was violent but not romantic. Clarence and Alabama are two people deeply in love who walk into a dangerous oppportunity and they take it together. ""True Romance"" is funny, dark, intense, romantic, and it's done well.

Two-Disc Special Edition dvd: 5 stars / I really enjoyed the special features on this dvd especially the writer's commentary by Quentin Tarantino which offers a lot of insight and background information about the writing and selling of the script. Unlike many director and writer commentaries, Tarantino's commentary is interesting and entertaining making you feel like he is your friend watching the film with you. On the second disc is an enjoyable selected commentary given by actor Michael Rappaport who offers a lot of behind-the-scenes info on his scenes, and he is genuinely funny on this commentary too. Also included on the second disc is the original ending from Tarantino's script. I have mixed feelings about the original ending, but I love that director Tony Scott shot it, and it is included on this dvd along with several deleted and extended scenes.

And man, is it awesome. The deleted material is excellent. The first feature I watched (well, listened to) was the audio commentary by the film's stars, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. It was insightful, informative and often hilarious, and I liked how they stayed in character for the better half of the commentary. There's also insight from Scott and Tarrentino. Co-stars Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt and Michael Rapaport go over their respective scenes (admittedly, Rapaport's went on a little long, and I wish Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Brosnon Pinchott, James Gandolfini and many of the film's other great actors contributed as well).

1750884,4,B00006FDCF,"True Romance has Quentin Tarantino's fingerprints all over it, although it was actually directed by Tony Scott.  It has everything, from a Mexican standoff, to the rat-a-tat dialogue, to the same obsession with 70s flicks that are common in many of Tarantino's films.  The only thing it's missing is Uma Thurman.

The story is almost beside the point: a comic book nerd named Clarence Worley (Christian Slater, were we all to suffer his lot in life!) hooks up with a prostitute, Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) with a heart of gold.  What could have been a traumatic experience for the both of them blossoms into a passionate romance. It's not long before the two get married.

Unlike say, Pretty Woman, True Romance reminds us that being a prostitute is not fun.  Part of the unglamorous side of Alabama's life is her abusive pimp, Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman, fantastic as always).  Clarence decides to get Alabama's possessions back from the pimp and settle the score. The plot spirals from there, but it involves a huge amount of cocaine that's so expensive, just possessing it is a liability.

On Clarence's side is his big doofus of a friend, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), an aspiring actor that's particularly Joey-esque.  For some reason, Brad Pitt plays Floyd, Dick's stoner roommate. Clarence also looks for help from his dad, Clifford (the always amusing Dennis Hopper).  Guiding (if you can call it that) Clarence through life is his illusionary mentor, Elvis (wouldja believe, Val Kilmer?). No, seriously. It doesn't take long before Dick hooks Clarence up with a buyer.  That buyer is Eliot Blitzer, representing the famous Hollywood director Lee Donowitz (played by Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek respectively).

The cocaine belongs to the Mob, of course, led by Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) and his thug Virgil (James Gandolfini), two of the most philosophical Mobsters you'll ever meet.  The dialogue between Walken and Hopper is worth the price of admission alone. Also on the trail of the coke are the police, led by Cody Nicholson (Tom Sizemore) and his partner Nicky Dimes (Chris Penn).  They almost sound more like the Mob than the Mob does. Which is perhaps the point.

True Romance isn't just about romance.  It's about passion, the kind of passion that binds people together in ways they can't even understand: lovers (Clarence and Alabama), fandom (Clarence and Elvis), and even murder (Vincenzo and Clifford).  Our hero perseveres because he believes in the power of love and, once he finds it, will do anything to keep it alive.  It's that passion that propels the plot forward, such that even those who only peripherally experience the romance between Clarence and Alabama are willing to sacrifice everything for them.  But True Romance reserves its passion most for the love between father and son. It can be a love worth dying for (Clarence and Clifford), or a hatred so intense that it's self destructive (Lee and Eliot).

This is one star-studded cast that actually lives up to expectations.  Don't be fooled: True Romance is as passionate and foul-mouthed as anything Tarantino has written.  But it's a love letter to lovers, celebrating what brings out the best and worst in humanity.

Watch it, if only to see two pros (Hopper and Walken) at the top of their game.  Trust me, I should know...I'm part Sicilian.",1127001600,44,3363,5.0071942446043165

1750887,3,B00006FDCF,"I rented True Romance expecting great things. Many people had it on their top 20 lists. So I watched the film, and was amused by the duality of the story.

It starts off very interestingly. The main character meets a beautiful woman, falls in love, they have sex, turns out she is a call girl, etc. This is all executed with classical, Tarantino style dialogue. The characters are funny, interesting, and most importantly, likeable.

Then everything goes to hell. A pimp is involved, along with a suitcase full of cocaine. The two lovers plan to sell the drugs in Hollywood. Along the way, there are a few interesting cameos: Cristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper share the best scene of the movie. Val Kilmer is very good as Elvis. However, for the most part, the bulk of this movie strays from the great first 20 minutes. There is violence, that, while not extreme, made me feel disgusted. The presentation of deeper themes is ruined by director Tony Scott.

Then there is the end. For some reason, the ending gels. Yes, it's Tarantino's favorite: A Mexican Standoff. The presentation of violence would have made for a perfect ending. However, there is at the end a tacked on happy ending. Too bad.

Now, on to the DVD. I would have been happy to let this sleeping dog lie, but I noticed a commentary track with Tarantino. That track is classic and hilarious. I explored the rest of the special features, and found that they were all very good. So good, in fact, that I went out and bought this DVD. No, I can't say I like this movie very much, but this is one of the best DVD packages I've ever seen. Rent it, not any other version.",1124496000,4,1633,4.52542372881356

One of my greatest regrets is that I can never again see this movie for the first time. It is electrifying, hysterically funny, intense, gory, and above all entertaining from start to finish. I defy anyone to find two consecutive minutes that do not make you wince or laugh...or both, and the final shootout ranks among the greatest of all time.

The screenplay was written by a 24-year-old Quentin Tarantino (with co-worker Roger Avary) while they were clerks at the Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, CA. and sold because neither had the money to produce the film. It is not nearly as famous as Pulp Fiction, but I think it is as good in many ways, and is an absolute must-see for all Tarantino fans.

Patricia Arquette epitomizes every guy's dream girl....hot, nasty, shrewd, tough as nails, and (most importantly) absolutely loyal to her man.

Clarence (Christian Slater) proves to be a quick study when it comes to mayhem and revenge....from comicbook store geek to crotch-blasting madman in very few scenes.

The rest of the stars, from Christopher Walken to Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt to Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore to Val Kilmer, etc. etc. all give wonderful performances because they have the benefit of some of the greatest situations and scintillating dialog in their careers.

1750910,4,B00006FDCF,"Say what you will about Quentin Tarantino, he deserves credit for one thing: his work has consistently managed to illuminate a side of American life that most of us can scarcely imagine.  For those us living in the world of sensible import cars, white-collar jobs, and quiet suburban dwellings, Tarantino gives us a glimpse of another, darker world, one populated by drug dealers, gangsters, cops on the edge, and assorted other colorful characters.  Watching Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill for some is sort of like entering a parallel universe, and while I can't be sure how true-to-life Tarantino's depiction of life on the other side of the law is, it always makes for some thrilling viewing.

Which brings us to the less-ironically-titled-than-you-might-think True Romance, written by Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott, a romantic movie for guys who don't like romantic movies.  Sure, it's based on a premise you won't find in any Jennifer Lopez movie--poor comic-store clerk falls for and marries the call girl hired by his boss to show him a good time on his birthday--and it takes place against the backdrop of Detroit's post-industrial decay before moving on to the morally decayed world of Hollywood.  That said, at bottom True Romance is about love, and the wild-eyed idealism, Devil-may-care recklessness, and irrational devotion that go with it.
Sure, this is a bizarre, unconventional, and subversive love story, but it's a love story just the same, which is a large part of the movie's enduring appeal.

Of course, this is also a love story written by Quentin Tarantino, so you can expect to see plenty of wacky characters and twisted happenings, and True Romance doesn't disappoint in this regard.  While it was written before the release of Pulp Fiction made him American cinema's unofficial arbiter of cool, this movie showcases his signature style in all its fast-paced, hyper-violent, pop culture-referencing glory.  Fittingly, Scott directs with a manic intensity and efficiency that keeps things moving along briskly, and with this unrated director's cut (perhaps the best three words in the English language), you get to see the film's ample bloodshed in even more unflinching brutality.

It all starts with the meeting of the aforementioned comic-store clerk and call girl, Clarence (Christian Slater, actually showing a modicum of acting ability) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette, who's never looked better), in a run-down movie theater during a Sonny Chiba triple-header.  From there, things progress quickly: the pair get married; Clarence decides to dispatch Alabama's ex-pimp (played in hilariously over-the-top fashion by a dreadlocked, ebonics-spouting Gary Oldman) and accidentally gets away with a suitcase full of cocaine; he and Alabama flee to L.A. with mobsters in pursuit and decide to sell the coke to an imperious movie producer.  Of course, things go wrong somewhere along the line, leading to one of history's great climatic shootouts, rivalling even the mother of them all, the concluding church standoff from John Woo's The Killer.  Througout the movie, blood flows liberally, the best and worst elements of human nature are put on sharp display, and tons of whip-smart dialogue is exchanged.  Even Elvis himself, looking and sounding a lot like Val Kilmer, makes a couple of appearances.

Hmmmm, what else is there?  Well, there's Dennis Hopper as Clarence's doomed ex-cop of a father, delivering one of movie history's greatest monologues to a group of assembled mobsters as he reveals his extensive knowledge of Sicilian history and genealogy.  There's Christopher Walken, playing Christopher Walken in a the role of an intense, steely-eyed mob counsel, and James Gandolfini as--what else?--a vicious gangster who likes his job a bit too much.  There's also Brad Pitt as Clarence's friend's roommate Floyd, an unmotivated stoner who provides a measure of comic relief amid the often-dour proceedings.  But through it all, the love between Clarence and Alabama is at the film's center, giving heart to what would otherwise be an exciting but fairly conventional cops-and-robbers story.  And that, more than anything, is what elevates this movie above the plain: its creators' willingness to combine disparate elements and genres and come out with something legitimately unique in the process.  Even now, more than a decade after its release, True Romance can easily be proclaimed one of the finest entries in the action-romance-gangster subgenre.",1120867200,4,4504,5.30801687763713

Which, for a budding writer like myself, is gold dust.
The extras are pretty good, too. Especially when you find out  that the '[...] eatin' scene is actually about 3mins longer, and was more of an issue for the censors than Alabama's whippin,' courtesy of Tony Soprano. As Chris Walken so cleverly points out in his interview clip on the extras; 'Quentin write these Elizabethen style, intricate pieces of dialogue that you just cant help but be absorbed into.' It's true, if Shakespeare were around today, these are the kinds of scenarios and people he'd be accomadating.",1104883200,,838,4.739726027397261
1750916,5,B00006FDCF,"One of the more scholarship-worthy films of the past ten years is A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.  The merits of the film do not lie in the plot, crafting or acting, but rather the happy dance of compromise by the two architects of the film, Steven Speilberg (director) and Stanley Kubrick (writer/developer).  With radically different ideas about drama, ambiguity and continuity, the marriage of these two artists seemed impossible.  But after Speilberg took over for the late Kubrick and picked up the film, A.I. became the most interesting collaboration in recent history, and to date is the most unconventional film of Speilberg and the most populist of Kubrick.

The same type of compromise is at work in True Romance, a film directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun) and written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction).  Without getting into filmmakers on the margins of Hollywood, no two creators are more different.  Disagree?  Try to find commonalities in Pulp Fiction and Top Gun.  And so, like A.I., True Romance becomes a child whose very existence speaks to the differences in the aesthetics placed on the craft of filmmaking by its two fathers.

True Romance follows Clarence, a comic book store employee with a fascination for Elvis and Kung Fu, and his new bride Alabama, a former call girl who takes pride in only turning three tricks.  After they are married, Clarence goes after his wife's former pimp and comes away with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Unsure of how to unload their new score, the self proclaimed ""minimum wage kids"" head off to California to try to sell their product in one big transaction to a movie producer who is a friend of a friend of Clarence.  With mafiosos on their tall and the police closing in on them, the film climaxes with Taratino's favorite device, the Mexican Stand-off, with bodyguards, cops and mobsters all pointing guns at each other.

A better cast has never been put together, but much of that is owed to luck, as future superstars litter the scenes in extra roles.  Made in 1993, the film features performances by Brad Pitt, Sam Jackson and James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) all before they became Hollywood power-players.  In addition, the principle cast features solid stars like Christian Slater, Rosanna Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Michael Rappaport and Christopher Walken doing what Christopher Walken does: walk into a movie, spend five minutes on screen and create a moment that no viewer will forget.

The earmarkings of Tarantino are everywhere: the long monologues, the super cool criminals and the references to Kung Fu, Elvis and comic books.  But Tony Scott creates a film from the original script that will be enjoyed by many folks turned off by Tarantino's avaunt gaurde form of directing.  The film does not contain a confusing narrative and does not end with ambiguous questions.  Rather, Scott does with this script what he does with most of his films: he makes a conventional film with a happy ending that most people will understand.  At the very least, this is a lesson in collaboration.",1101081600,,3075,4.96875

1750939,5,B00006FDCF,"After the first three scripts (this, Reservoir dogs, and Pulp Fiction) Tarantino is sometimes entertaining, always clever, duff, but this film is high art.

Some people say that ""True Romance"" takes a while to warm up, but I prefer the beginning. After it arrives in Hollywood and becomes an action film, it is still excellent, but in inception it is perfection.

""True Romance,"" refers I believe, like ""Pulp Fiction,"" to a genre of novels that cater to the dreams of the unfulfilled. And this film shows use the sort of dream that might-satisfy. But, the tragic beauty of ""True Romance"" is that, unlike the genre it parodies, it is self-aware. Wow.

The emphasis is on dream. Despite what big-richard-critic below says, super-nerds know, that there is no fullfilment in this world. Like J. Alfred Purfrock, they have been through it all in their heads.

The opening soundtrack by Zimmer, complete with whistling wind, sirens, and a background of Detroit down-and-outs, hangs in my mind as theme for this movie: unfulfillable hope.

The music, and this film, crystalise the unearthly hope of those out in the cold, comic-book (or video rental) shop of despair. It nerds like this that show us the way things might have been. Think Wuthering Height's Emily Bronte, who never got to know anyone, let alone a guy, outside her immediate family circle. Tarantino was on acid, strung-out, speaking in tongues. He must have been delisciously insane. That lone super-nerd dreamt up paradise and then some, in spades.

Other reviewers have noted the fourtuitousness with which Clarence finds a girl that likes comic books and Kung Fu movies, but does she? She is a call girl that is paid to be there. All the same, even in the face of that -- the scene on the roof does it for me -- they hold on to the dream.

(Admitedly there are no women in this film. The only woman is the Super-nerd's anima. )

The rest of the movie is a collection of dream sequences, all driven by a refrain of ""wouldn't it be really cool if.."" the males could incarnate machismo, 'sell the contradiction'. And the scenes are very, very cool.

""True Romance"" is full of monologues. The characters, walking through dreams on their own, rarely really interact. But the monologues by Hopper, Walkren, and Gandolfini rank with Shakespeare.

Even Christian Slater's phone call, ""If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire,"" or the hard boiled cop duo Nickolson and Dime's monologue a deux -- ""somthing's rotten in Denmark,"" -- are redefining cool all the way.

But, just as Cathy and Heathcliff's fantasy on the moor -- they are prince and princess -- is just that, Clarence and Alabama's  fantastic journey from Detroit to Hollywood never touches down. People complain about the unreality of this film, but ""True Romance"" is meant to be that way, at least until what should have been the end.

I think that Tony Scott did a good job (even outdoing his brother's genuius) but I wish that he had stayed with the original script's ending. At the same time, I think we know how the film should have ended.

I have been reading the other reviews. I agree with those that say that it is *one of the best movies ever made*.

 El Satanico says:
""When people say that stories like Romeo and Juliet, Gone With the Wind and Sleepless in Seattle are the greatest love stories ever told then those people obviously haven't seen TRUE ROMANCE yet.""

not telling says:
"" I don't remember hearing much press about it when it was released, but I rented it when it first hit the shelves and I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. This is such a great movie.""

kubrik2899 says
""Quentin Tarantio struck all the right notes when he wrote this fantastic motion picture, which, in my opinion, is the greatest motion picture of all time.""

There are lots more, please read the reviews.

People who do not like the truth will not like this movie. This movie shows us what we want, and that it is unatainable. But at the same time, this movie tells shows us that the dream is bigger and more powerful than the truth. The truth is a lie. This IS true romance.

1750940,5,B00006FDCF,"Wow.  This is the screenplay that got hopeless geek Quentin Tarantino out from behind the video store counter and into the consciousness of a filmgoing public that now has him firmly entrenched within all-that-is-cool from the early 1990's to the present day.

For starters, check the talent:  Christian Slater (hey, he was BIG back then), Patricia Arquette, some goombah-wannabe named James Gandolphini, Samuel L. Jackson (of course you've got to have HIM), Bronson Pinchot (was he still doing that horrible TV show then?), Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore, ""Psychos-R-Us"" character actor gods Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken (the confrontation between Walken and Dennis Hopper is one of the most brilliant scenes ever written AND filmed), Val Kilmer (always shot out-of-focus, the voice BARELY gives him away), and Brad Pitt before he emerged as a solid leading actor for mainstream Hollywood displaying a talent for stealing every scene he's in without ever getting up from a sofa.  Sheer brilliance.

This is an ensemble-cast movie that really works...everyone feeds off each other's abilities, and no one gets stepped on in a fit a primadonnery.  The story itself is pure dime-store fiction designed to appeal to escapists who may have spent too much time behind the counter of video rental shops...but like most successful art, it succeeds because its creator was inspired and working from his own heart.  Tarantino generally writes screenplays for the type of movie he likes; as such, when he is inspired as he was in the lead-up to ""Pulp Fiction"" there wasn't anyone who could match him.  Judging by the caliber of big-name actors who agreed to lend their talents and curb their egos to bring this movie to fruition, this is a sentiment that many in the business shared even early on in QT's career.

Terrific, outstanding movie...extremely violent, sexy and innocent at the same time, very funny, and still hip after all these years.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing something special.",1096329600,3,2019,5.109422492401216

I remember seeing this in the movie theaters and walking out of there blown away.  Then when it came to cable, I watched it every time I caught it.  This is truly a guy's fantasy love story.  Think about it, a chick that's into a guy that loves comics and kung fu flicks.

The acting is superb... especially the scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.  A testament to Tarantino's writing, the direction and the acting: I'm a black guy and I think it's probably one of the most classic scenes I have EVER seen in a movie.  For those of you that have seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about.

The other actors were great as well.  In terms of casting, this movie was sheer perfection.

Now let me get on to the DVD extras.  One of the main reason I love DVDs are the extras.  I am so angry whenever a studio skimps out on the extras.  Especially when DVDs have so much space and the footage is available.  You can slap on some uncut footage on a DVD and I'd be happy.

This DVD FAR EXCEEDS any expectation I would have had for a DVD package.  Quentin's live commentary on this DVD (as opposed to the chopped up edited one on Reservoir Dogs) is priceless.  There's also a live storyboard display that you can look at while watching the movie.  Awesome.  I also love the longer beatup scenes with James Gandolfini.

1750944,5,B00006FDCF,"I recently read Tarantino's original screenplay to ""True Romance"". Apart from the change in narrative structure (non-chronological), it hints to a bleaker, grittier urban drama, with a tragic ending. It would have been very interesting to see the final film in Tarantino's vision.
Tony Scott's sugar-coated adaptation works wonders though. It was made very clear in the script that the relationship between the two leads was very strong. Scott took this unison and gave the film a fairy-tale tone. The villains in the film are very colourful, contributing to the feel that Scott has established. Hans Zimmer's score does nothing better, than to enforce this vision.
The cast is one of the most impressive line-ups I've ever seen. Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both characters come off very likable with clear, clean, simple motives. These are career performances. Dennis Hopper gives good in his limited screen-time as Christian's ex-cop, ex-alcoholic father. It is in his time shared with Christopher Walken (being a one-scene wonder, like in ""Pulp Fiction""), that he comes off at his best. The Sicilian scene is Walken's most intense since ""Deer Hunter"". Gary Oldman also gives another deliciously evil and memorable performance, the man is a chameleon, he is yet to unimpress me.
But one of my favourite things about the cast is seeing then-relative-unknowns Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini in small, but memorable roles. A real shame that Jackson's performance was cut down heavily from the script, some of the dialogue in his one scene was very amusing, if maybe a little offensive to some.
""True Romance"" is a brilliant crime drama, and a perfect (if phased) introduction to Tarantino's work, it is probably the most accessible film he's penned. People will always ponder over whether or not Tarantino's directorial version would have been better, but they can always rest-assure that Scott has given a wonderful adaptation, supported by a very strong cast.

1750946,5,B00006FDCF,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time!!!! I can watch certain scenes over and over. The chemistry between Patricia and Christian is some of the best chemistry between two actors I've seen on the big screen  (as it always is when two stars actually date. Check out Christian and Samantha Mathis' chemistry in Pump up the Volume) All the other characters are insane as well. One of the best cast films of all time. The scene between Christopher Walken and Hopper is true genius, (although I was kind of wondering why Christian or Patricia during the commentary don't mention that fact that it is racist [i guess we are just supposed to assume that just because it is Quentin Tarantino, race comments shouldn't be taken seriously? Hmmmm I haven't read Quentin's commentary yet.]) And that brown spot on Michael Rapaport's shirt after Brad Pitt (Floyd) doesn't get him toilet paper is hysterical. Maybe there is a link between those scenes or maybe not, but Tony directs the crap out of these actors and I catch something new each time I watch it. This special rated version is dope. Christian and Patricia's commentary is funny as hell. It must be weird watching a sex scene with a former lover on screen ten years later!!! And there are A LOT of great other special features. We get to see Tony Scott's storyboards. He made about 900 drawn frames, shot to shot of the movie. I learned a lot about the movie and filmmaking in general. I just hope that Christian and Tarantino can work together again. Christian's career needs just a little more twang thang shabang, and I know he can do it. He's got his kids and wife to make it happen. Christian Slater is one of the sexiest men on the screen of all time. The man literally takes my breath away everytime he is on screen. That voice? Those mannerisms? That laugh that is only one ""Heh"", and that crotch? GOOD GOD. Much love in your direction man, life is hard what can I say? Oh, and Patricia is a kick ass little adorable thang too.",1085788800,,1989,4.525

1750948,4,B00006FDCF,"Subtley was never Tarantino's strong suit, but in this, his earliest effort, there isn't even a touch of it in evidence. True Romance is completley over-the-top. What hinders it most is first the self-indulgence in the screen play. The main character, a comic book shop clerk, Kung Fu and Sonny Chiba enthusiast and lover of movies 'with balls,' could literally be Tarantino himself, and when he falls in love with a beautiful girl who reciprocates fully and shares his interests, it makes you kind of suspicious. The other occasional hinderance is the overwhelming star power in the movie. Rarely do you see so many big-name actors competing for screen space, and it's downright surreal if you've seen some of their other famous performances. Take a secne where Christopher Walken, improbably playing a Sicilian Mafia Don, threatens a nice-guy ex-cop played by - Dennis Hopper. It doesn't seem so much like mobster vs. cop as Christopher Walken vs. Dennis Hopper, and you can't help but think that if Dennis Hopper were in his Frank Booth persona, boy, would things be different. Meanwhile, the guy who plays Tony Soprano is standing in background, attendant to Walken. Then you have Samuel L. Jackson and the guy who plays 'Nice Guy' Eddie in Reservoir Dogs in walk-on roles, Val Kilmer is in there somewhere and Brad Pitt has ten minutes as the immobile stoner roomate who spoils everything. Granted, it's only retrospectively that some of these people are famous, but it's still distracting.
These and other factors make it impossible to take True Romance seriously, but it's still extremely entertaining. It's more violent than Kill Bill pt. 1 and more shamelessly comic than Reservoir Dogs - if you thought the climax of Reservoir Dogs was violent, watch about three times as many people die in a scene worthy of a Shakespearian tragedy. Gary Oldman provides some of the funniest moments as the pimp who 'only wishes' he were black (""He musta thought it was white boy day!...It aint white boy day, is it?""), and the romance between the two main characters, while not entirely believable, is pretty hot.
Direction by veteran Tony Scott doesn't seem to help the movie particularly; I get the feeling it might have worked better if Tarantino had directed it himself, novice though he was.
A lot of this serves to fuel the charge that Tarantino is hopelessly immature, but all aesthetic ethics aside, it really shouldn't be missed.",1082851200,2,2433,4.951100244498778
1750978,5,B00006FDCF,"""True Romance"" is a personal favorite. Watching it for the first time a decade ago, was mind-blowing. Not since I was young and saw ""Star Wars"", has a movie so completely transported me, and given me such an overwhelming experience. The movie was my introduction to Quentin Tarantino's world, it's an amalgam of everything I love about his work. This is a touchstone of 90's cinema, a film geek essential. This movie contains classic scene after classic scene. The awesome grand finale is the best mexican standoff since ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"". I love this movie! Revisiting ""True Romance"" is like seeing old friends again. While the film itself is the usual Quentin Tarantino goofiness, the pace and the acting makes this film a must see. And the acting is incredible--most especially Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Their final confrontation scene may be one of the most amazing dialogs between two great actors ever filmed. How the director gets performances like this out of all his actors amazes me. From James Gandolfini to Tom Sizemore to Brad Pitt to Hopper and Walken, and especially Gary Olman as Drexel, well they all deliver.  Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper share a brief moment in this movie, and it is, without a doubt, the best display of passive aggressive behaviour in any movie, ever. To be honest, I never liked Christian Slater, but he is okay in this movie. The Last scene in the Producer's Hotel Suite is also fantastic. How the hell does Tarantino write such masterpieces? Simply Superb Movie.",1082505600,,1537,4.888888888888889
1750979,5,B00006FDCF,"When people say that stories like Romeo and Juliet, Gone With the Wind and Sleepless in Seattle are the greatest love stories ever told then those people obviously haven't seen TRUE ROMANCE yet. While I don't own the unrated DVD, I have seen this film and can obviously say that TRUE ROMANCE is one of the best and most underrated films ever made.
The story involves two people who come together and fall in love instantly, the two in question are Clarence, a comic book store clerk, and Alabama, a first time prostitute. Unfortuneatly for them they get involved in a series of nasty and complicated circumstances involving everyone from the Mafia to movie producers. To say that this film is multi layered is an understatement.
But at the heart of this film is just a simple heart warming love story between two social outcasts and their quest for happiness.
This film was always going to be good, but thanks to everyone involved in the making of this film it is awesome. Tony Scott does a fantastic job of bringing Quentin Tarantino's brilliant script to life. And the performances from the large ensemble cast is inspiring. While the film belongs to Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette special mention should also go to everyone involved for giving their all.
Put simply this film is essential if you like be immersed in your films you will like this. Buy it and cherish it.",1079568000,,1380,4.730290456431535
1750980,3,B00006FDCF,"This is Tarantino and you know it about 40 minutes into the movie. Which is not as quick as one would want, the movie begins with a really drippy ""romance"" between a floozie and a (pathetically mis-cast) Christian Slater. Based on the idea of the underclass conquering the powerful bigshots the film sees two nobodies dice with death, to find their dream in paradise. Fair enough theme.
But trust QT and Tony Scott to make a wannabe mess of that theme, just in the interests of making a doozie. The movie has moments that feel like you are watching Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, which thus give you a glimmer of hope for something worthwhile to come, but that bit comes in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie when the plot finally begins -- drugs, shootouts, a zonked out Brad Pitt  etc, with about 60% of the F-words completely unnecessary.
Then there are gaping WTFs. Christopher Walkern, a Sicillian honcho simply vanishes after a cooldude scene with Dennis Hopper. Difficult to see how that fit into the scheme of things other than some pseudo-cool dialogue that carries the sophistication of ""your mama"" jibes (literally.)
Towards the end, we are supposedly meant to enjoy the vicious beating up of Patricia Arquette at the hands of Gondolfini, much in keeping with the gore fest that Tarantino is associated with. Thank you, have a nice day. Next.
There's so much insufferably maudlin stuff about Elvis, it made the movie come perilously close to a run-of-the-mill chickflick.
Finally, Tony Scott has his photographer shoot with the usual irritating filters, back lighting and blacked out faces presumably because Jeffrey Kimball felt that if you have one photographic idea in fifteen years it's got to be worth repeating.
The point is, as it usually is in a typical QT self-contradiction, that you wouldn't want to meet these characters on the street, but these are simply created for online entertainment in our little bizarre modern fairytale. Yawn.",1073865600,11,1963,4.894894894894895
1750981,3,B00006FDCF,"Quentin Tarantino wrote the ultimate guy flick in the form of a romance movie, and then let Tony Scott polish it off with a bit of Hollywood sparkle. The resulting kitschy film comes off not so much a blockbuster epic, nor does it resemble a Tarantino-like piece of art. It just represents a sort of middle of the road movie that really could have been so much more, but still satisfies..
Clarence is a loser, until he meets Alabama, a young prostitute hired to show him a good time for his birthday. The two fall in love, and what starts with Clarence killing her pimp to take back her stuff, results in a cross country chase with Clarence and Alabama toting half a million dollars of cocaine in a suitcase, with the mob and the police on their tail.
The biggest draw of the movie is the star power, and more so the chemistry between certain actors and actresses in the many key scenes of the movie. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken play their cameos to the hilt, while Gary Oldman's performance as an urbanized white pimp absolutely steals the show in the first half of the movie. Up until Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette reach California, the movie remains dark, gritty, violent, and irreverent. But once the sunshine state hits, the slapstick-like comedy takes over, resulting in a shootout ending that doesn't so much make sense as it does distort the overall tone of the movie.
You get the sense that no one really knows what the hell is going on, so each character acts their own way. This results in a strangely mesmerizing but disjointed movie experience, as the movie definitely shines and lulls in its given moments.
But still, this movie is way smarter and more enjoyable than many other summer blockbusters that get tossed out there and deserved more acclaim in its 1993 debut than it originally received.",1071100800,2,1829,4.683229813664596
1750982,5,B00006FDCF,"Quentin Tarintino was a no-name when this movie hit the theaters. I don't remember hearing much press about it when it was released, but I rented it when it first hit the shelves and I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. This is such a great movie.
The story starts off when Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette) meet at a movie theater showing a kung-fu marathon. They spend the night together *nudge, nudge* wink, wink* and realize that they are in love with eachother and have been brought together by fate. Not a pair to let this moment pass, they get married less than 12 hours later. But, it's not quite happily ever after just yet. Alabama was a hooker (employeed for three days)and when Clarence goes to pick up some of her clothes, he gets into a fight with her pimp (Gary Oldman) and ends up killing him. He takes off (accidently leaving his drivers license behind) with a suitcase of Alabama's clothes. When he gets back to his wife - surprise! - it's not a suitcase full of clothes, it's a suitcase filled to the brim with cocaine. They decide to take advantage of the situation and drive out to LA to see Clarence's friend, Dick Richie (Micheal Rappaport)to see if he has any Hollywood connections who would buy half a million dollars worth of cocaine. Of course he does. But the plot gets more tangled as rightful owners of the cocaine (Tony Soprano, Christopher Walken, and others) want their drugs back and try to track them down & the cops are suddenly involved.
This movie is full of everything - romance, humor, action, drugs, rock-n-roll, sex. It doesn't get much better than this. Christian Slater is great & Patricia Arquette is the cutest thing ever. The movie is FULL of famous actors (those listed above plus Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer - who plays the voice of Clarence's alter-Elvis-ego, Brad Pitt)
The unrated directors cut is great because there are scenes added to the movie that weren't in the orginal - more graphic violence, drug use, language, and sex.
You will not be disappointed by this movie. It's a must-see and a must-own!",1068595200,2,2073,4.682191780821918

If, on the other hand, you want comedy, drama, romance, and a good moral, this film has it, too.  One feels every emotion possible simply in the ending of this film.  It even ends with a photo finish of the sun setting over the ocean.  One thing I must say is that I am glad that Quentin Tarantino did not direct this film.  I have read the original screenplay, and on the marvelous two-disc DVD, there is a recreated alternate ending.  This ending is terrible.  Through the whole film, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) is all like, ""I love you, Clarence.  I love you, I love you, I love you.""  Then, all of a sudden, she hates his guts.

Clarence wants Alabama to leave Drexl behind, and goes to see him. When he does, all hell breaks loose, and Clarence is forced to kill him. Clarence accidentally mistakes Alabama's belongings for a suitcase full of narcotics that was meant for Drexl's boss Vincenzo Coccotti(Christopher Walken). Thinking that everything is fine, Alabama and Clarence get married and go out to Hollywood where they will attempt to sell the narcotics and start a new life with the money. The only probelm is that Coccotti dispatches his right hand man Virgil (James Gandolfini) and the rest of his gang to track Alabama and Clarence down. So now the two have to avoid Coccotti's men, as well the cops that are hot on their tails.
""True Romance"" became an instant favorite of mine after the first time that I saw it back in 1993. I have seen it many times since, and still consider it one of the best films to come out of the 90's. Quentin Tarantino was the man behind the brilliant script that offers a classic tale of love and revenge. The ending is absolutely outstanding, and provides for an overall enjoyable experience. The film could be described as a modern version of Bonnie and Clyde. However, Tarantino's trademark dialogue, and the outstanding cast make ""True Romance"" a much better film in my opinion. The cast is filled with outstanding actors that includes - Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, James Gandolfini, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchott, Chris Penn, Michael Rapaport, and Tom Sizemore. Every single one of them turns in a top notch performance.
""True Romance"" offers a well rounded cast, and an outstanding love story filled with action, revenge, classic dialogue, and a great ending. The DVD is great. The film was re-released with the Unrated Director's Cut 2 Disc Special Edition. The extras are wonderful. You get an interactive behind the scenes featurette, selective commentaries from Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rappaport, and Val Kilmer. There is also over 30 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, and an alternate ending to the film. Do yourself a favor and pick this up as soon as you can.",1064275200,3,2542,4.927738927738928

Here we meet Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette); two star crossed lovers who embark on a cross country road trip with a very large amount of stolen mafia cocaine.  What results is the two running and gunning their way culminating in a Mexican standoff with cops, crooks, and the mob.  Did I mention that Clarence also talks to the ghost of Elvis (Val Kilmer) whenever he goes to the bathroom?  Tarantino's penchant for witty, pulpy dialog seems a bit underused here in comparison with his other projects (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown), but Scott's frantic bloody direction makes True Romance stand on it's own.  The rest of the great cast includes Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot (who steals many a scene), Samuel L.

1751018,4,B00006FDCF,"Tony Scott's True Romance has become something of a minor classic in the years since its original 1993 release. It's a great, often overlooked film and I recommend it regularly to people who like Tarantino. True Romance was one of Tarantino's first screenplays and the sale of the script allowed him to make Reservoir Dogs. It's a story full of Tarantino's trademarks: graphic violence, movie references, great dialogue, quirky characters, shootouts, etc. I don't doubt that the film would have been a masterpiece if Tarantino had directed, but Tony Scott does a admirable job. His direction is straightforward and non-extravagant. He just stands back and lets Tarantino's characters and dialogue run wild.
At heart, True Romance is little more than a conventional lovers-on-the-lam crime adventure. A guy and a girl, madly in love, come across a suitcase full of cocaine and are out to get rid of it while avoiding the gangsters that are on their tails. However, what elevates the film above the conventions of its genre are the quirky characters, juicy Tarantino dialogue and a good sense of humor. The exceptional cast doesn't hurt either. The movie is jam-packed full of great actors: Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, James Gandolfini, Saul Rubinek, and Samuel L. Jackson (briefly). The cast is great, and the two leads Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both very good and believable as a young couple. Despite the seemingly ironic title, it actually is a romance at heart. Clarence and Alabama could be the Bonnie and Clyde of the '90s.
The 2-disc special edition is the one to own. It has a lovely widescreen transfer in the proper 2.35:1 aspect ratio, your choice of Dolby Digital or DTS soundtracks, three audio commentaries, deleted scenes and an alternate ending. A pretty packed DVD of a fine movie. The film itself is the unrated version which actually differs little from the R-rated version except that there's more violence.
It's a very enjoyable movie that fans of the crime/gangster/action genre are sure to like and fans of Quentin Tarantino will certainly enjoy.",1053820800,,2142,5.088068181818182
1751019,5,B00006FDCF,"I don't remember when this originally came out but I missed it and it was recommended to me at the Video Store.  I was completely surprised how good of a movie this was.
From the start to finish the movie just goes.  There are so many good acters playing minor charater roles and they do them each so well.  First is Drexel the white pimp who thinks he's a black guy played by Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson has a minor role in this film with Drexel so you have to watch to catch him.  Dennis Hopper is great as Clearence's dad. The best part is when he tells the history of Sicily to bad guy mafiosa Vincenzo Cocotti played by Chistopher Walken.
As one of of Walken's henchmen is James Gandolfini who gets in a great fight with Alabama played by Patrica Arquette and they rip each other apart.  It pretty violent but it's kinda funny too watching this little girl take on this huge guy.
I didn't know until I got the DVD that the Elvis guy was played by Val Kilmer because you never see his face.  Brad Pitt is great as Floyd the stoner who only leaves the couch once during the whole movie. Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore are great as the cops thinking they are going to get in on the best bust of their lives.
All the characters come together in as the movie flows.  The love story part is good too because it is not overdone.  Some of the things that Patrica Arquette wears are pretty weird.
As for the extras on the film the commentaries are pretty good but there are some dead spots when the actor are just watching the movie and enjoying it.  They have some pretty good stories.
The extra film clips and the featurette on the making of the movie are pretty good.  The deleted scenes are pretty much an extension of the regular scenes but you do get to see Jack Black.
The thing that blows you away is the alternative ending that they have.  There would be no way, I would have liked this movie as much if they used that ending.  It would not be as they say a fairy tale.",1050278400,5,1971,4.212765957446808
1751020,5,B00006FDCF,"Yes, I like this film much better than ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" and I like those films very well.  This one has it all though.  Perhaps having Tony Scott direct it instead of Tarantino is what made it because somehow ""True Romance"" doesn't feel like it is trying so hard to be a great film and thus becomes one.  There is also the fact that there were career defining performances in this film, some never to be equalled by those actors again.  Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater, in the lead romantic roles, are their best ever as two semi-losers who are in love and on the run.  James Gandolfini virtually gives an audition for his later Tony Soprano role as a mobster trying to break Arquette down through brutality.

Brad Pitt is absolutely marvelous in a totally comic role as Floyd, the spaced out, laid back, stunted IQ marvel who befuddles the bad guys.  You would be hard pressed to believe Pitt would be the one to become a major leading man!  There's also Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, mobster and retired cop, plus Gary Oldman, pimp and villain. All three are perfect in these supporting roles.  The plot itself is a very violent run from confrontation. Slater and Arquette are carrying wads of drug money, being the couple on the run from all these assorted villains. This film also contains probably the best shoot-out scene ever put on film because although it is violent it is also highly satiric. I bought this the instant it came on the market to replace my VHS version.

Bonus commentary (from the director,the screenwriter, and actors), alternate ending, and the deleted scenes are the reasons that I found myself purchasing this particular dvd twice. I originally bought the director's edition , not knowing that there was this special two disc version. but it was well worth the investment. If you're a true Tarrentino fan, you know what it means to have the extra stuff that was edited out, and there's several interesting scenes...expecially, the first appearance of Drexel ( Gary Oldman), in the apartment. As for the film quality , great !! I love it when you can pick a scene , and while you choose , the pictures are moving in the little boxes. It lets me know that the people who made the dvd are saying to me..""hey , thanks for buying this old movie. here's a little something for you"". It sounds corny , but hey. The movie itself , is spellbinding. Tarrentino's script plays out like a stage production on film , and the casted actor's bring life to an already imaginative and dramatized characters. Plot : A nobody named Clarence falls for a (lonely ,but spirited)prostitute. Dissatisfied with their existance and becoming exuberated with one another, they begin a quest for ""a better tommorrow"". But it's what happens in the middle of that basic plotline, that the excitement lies. This film exemplifies why Tarrentino became one of the hottest directors and screenwriters of the nineties. Excellent dialog , creative action sequences, fantastic actors, nice budget , and enough directorial insight..to allow Brad Pitt the freedom,to steal his scenes , as Floyd, are the reasons why I love this movie. It's definately worth the money. So don't cheat yourself and treat yourself to a little romance....Tarrentino style.",1045008000,,1886,4.9715189873417724

He's obviously prejudiced(your Sicilian slept around, The Compton schmeel in Res. Dogs), ect. The close-ups of the actors, again and again. Yes, I know they are pretty/cute/important, but just because the director says someone is outta sight, doesn't make it so. Oh, and how can I forget the rambling. On and on about whatever just as long as it doesn't make sense. Like discussing a drug deal on a roller coaster. This is supposed to make Christian Slater hiper than hip, but let's face it. Anyone buying 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine should be able to handle a roller coaster, right? I'm glad he hasen't put out any movies recently so people can get back to what a good movie should be like, such as ""Trees Lounge"" or ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""",1037577600,4,905,4.627329192546584
