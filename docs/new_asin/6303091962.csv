556760,3,6303091962,"In 1940 Germany's submarine forces are winning the war in the Atlantic, and massive tonnage of allied shipping, including shipments of military aircraft, make it only to the bottom of the sea.  This Canadian made-for-TV mini-series uses this dire situation as a backdrop.

Since submarine warfare is slowly strangling Britain's ability to defend herself something has to be done to get materials across the Atlantic.  A bold military officer and his capable female assistant take on the responsibility of setting up a risky yet vital plan to fly planes across the north Altantic from Newfoundland to Britain.

When the officer and his assistant arrive at a small Newfoundland airfield, they face the challenges of recruiting and retaining pilots, and training them to fly across the north Altantic (a risky venture at best), and dealing with the local townsfolk.

We soon learn that the assistant has a history with the local airfield operator, and their past catches up to them as men and machines face perilous odds as they prepare to fly.

I found this show to depict an interesting and generally overlooked aspect of early WWII.  It therefore deserves recognition.  At the same time I found the acting and overall quality of the production to be only good, not great.

History buffs should enjoy this show, but the average viewer would probably find it to be rather tedious, since it is generally lacking in high-cost digital candy that flavors most movies these days.

I'd rate this 4-stars for the history buff/romance crowd, and perhaps 2- stars for the general audience.  I guess I'll split that difference and award this a solid 3-stars.

I hope this is helpful.  Have fun and fly safely!",1224979200,197,1697,4.975177304964539
556761,4,6303091962,"If you buy this because you see Jason Priestley's name in the cast list, you may be both sadly disappointed (his part is very small) and pleasantly surprised. This two-part Canadian Miniseries tells how a place most residents of the USA (and Canada and England, for that matter) had never heard of in 1939 became the primary embarkation point for thousands of US and Canadian built fighters and bombers flown to England to help turn the tide of the Second World War.  It's an interesting story, with a little human conflict, a little star-crossed love, and a lot of pride in what the human race can do when the chips are down.",1220572800,66,626,4.589285714285714
556762,5,6303091962,"Above and Beyond is about the critical period in World War II before the United States entered the war.  Germany had just taken France.  The U-boats were dominating shipping across the North Atlantic.  The air war over Britain was pressing the British to the edge.  Against this backdrop, a few brave souls in Canada and Britain work to fly planes across the Atlantic to avoid the U-Boats--something never previously attempted.  This is their story.

What is different about this film is the focus on character development along with a simple plot.  The primary location is a remote airport in Newfoundland where everyone knows everyone and displays a small-town ownership of problems and life in general.  The key participants in this drama are special only in their willingness to rise to the improbably difficult task in front of them.  The matter-of-fact sensibilities of the people as they confront serious logistical challenges reminds me of The Grey Fox (1982)--another really fine Canadian film.

I loved the film.  I hope that you will too.

556763,5,6303091962,"We caught only a part of this movie on TV, so my husband asked if I could find it on DVD.  This is a story of WWII that many of us in the States have never heard before.  It is so refreshing to get a good movie without the historical aspect being terribly skewed to fit the hunger for ""action"" films.  I enjoyed watching it, but my husband is the one who will not part with it, and says he will keep it for his library. His comment was that he wishes there were more films along the same lines. History, personal emotional upheavals, and last, but not least, some wonderful scenes of airplanes you now go to museums to see.",1186358400,22,623,4.132231404958677
556764,5,6303091962,"What a wonderful delight. I am an avid history buff and was very surprised to find a huge story of WW2 that I knew nothing about. This movie details, with great charm, the perilous mission of flying new American made planes from Newfoundland to Ireland - a risky move that shortened the delivery time from 10 days to 10 hours. The venture was responsible for turning the tide of the war. The acting is first class and includes stellar performances by Kenneth Walsh, Richard E. Grant and the inimitable Joss Ackland as Churchill. Sluggish at times and with poor digital animation of the planes (they only found one Hudson plane so had to computer generate the rest). Aviation buffs may notice some errors, but it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the film. It will take two nights to watch, so be prepared with lots of popcorn. Truly one of the more interesting films I have ever watched and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Definitely a must for getting teens hooked on history - includes a love story for the girls and lots of macho danger and adventure for the boys.",1181001600,138,1084,4.592783505154639
556765,4,6303091962,"Paul Tibbets-Enola Gay both names that mean part of the history. This is an absorbing subject, carefully handled about the officer who piloted and drooped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

Even I think Taylor wasn't the most appropriate actor for this role, ( I just can think in three names for that moment: Robert Donat, Fredric March and Michael Redgrave) and the film surely would have elevated to a major status.

The only default to my mind is the real nightmare derived from this action; the awful sequels that surrounded the mind and personality of Tibbets are simply absent. There was a very long introduction showing the backgrounds.

A well supporting cast accompanied him. Good point for Melvin Frank.

Two years later after this film was released,  the American journalist William Bradford Huie wrote the most documented text about this subject. Try to get this important historic testimony.",1123459200,4,901,5.0608108108108105
556766,5,6303091962,"Though I could have seen this movie as a 10 year old when it first came out, I didn't, and was even unaware of its existence.  But by chance I caught it yesterday on a cable movie channel.  I was stunned by its power.  The final scenes of Hiroshima on fire were especially powerful.  (Even though I knew the Enola Gay didn't actually hang around to observe, I accepted the artistic license, as the scene ""felt"" right.)  Since I grew up in the 1950s, I wasn't troubled by the acting or by the movie being in black and white.  And if you want to see scenes involving B-29s, there sure are lots of those here.  This movie should be more widely known.",1118620800,36,647,4.254098360655738
556767,2,6303091962,"I wouldn't have bought this movie for myself, but got it for my Dad's 75th birthday. Dad had fond memories of it from seeing it on the big screen in 1952.

It seems to me that the movie was designed (maybe inadvertently) to appeal to men AND women. The primary emphasis is how Tibbetts' job of getting a squadron ready to drop the first atomic bombs affected his marriage. That looks pretty dumb in print, but it's true.

Much is made of how long the Tibbetts were separated during the war and how the stress of Paul's job and the need for secrecy (even where his wife was concerned) almost caused their marriage to fail.

The acting is typical for the era: melodramatic. This aspect of old movies probably turns off more people than black and white does. The characters don't seem real. I don't think anyone talked that way even in World War II.

The only actor who seemed the least bit natural was the infant playing the Tibbetts youngest son.

This last bit is minor compared to my major gripes, but no other reviewer mentioned it so here goes:

After the bomb has exploded the crew of the Enola Gay use binoculars in the cockpit to see fires burning on the ground in Hiroshima. This would have been impossible as the bomber was speeding AWAY from the city.",1113177600,7,1260,4.456521739130435

556849,5,6303091962,"Its a very interesting and, mostly, well done explanation of the way the US started flying, rather than shipping, war planes, to Britain, during WW2.

 The video ends, just about the point when the RAF takes over the operation and, therefore, leaves out many of the details, which occurred after that, such as most flights were piloted by women, once the US entered WW2.

557041,5,6303091962,"This one of only three times in his film career that Robert Taylor played an actual person that existed in the world.  Paul Tibbets was on the set as his story was told and he resembled Taylor and even had a widow's peak just like Taylor. In playing Paul Tibbets, Taylor dispensed with all of his famous personality star traits and played a very serious and courageous Colonel Tibbets who would not compromise his values. Taylor received the best reviews of his career for this role. It is exciting and moving to see the extreme attention to detail which the American military gave to pulling off the creation and the dropping of the bomb on Japan. When one witnesses in this film how far the military went to keep this operation secret and to protect the project, one gains a new appreciation of how easily things could have gone differently at the end of WWII.  The stress and conflict of this project were acted out with realism.  The actual footage of the dropping of the bomb in this film will be sobering to anyone who sees it. A love story was worked in to keep things interesting for all and a great military film was the result.",1436745600,,1137,4.483091787439614

557217,5,6303091962,"This is the classic 1952 docudrama that everyone should see, for the true story about the development and absolutely necessary use of the atomic bomb, for one purpose:  To end World War II as soon as possible and without the sacrifice of one million American lives that would have been the price of invading Japan and clearing out all resistance.

  Many efforts had been made to negotiate a surrender.  As noted by many who lived through those times:  ""The Japanese would just not stop.""  As said often by American servicemen:  ""It wasn't the Japanese people.  It was their leaders.""  The Japanese population was being trained to defend the homeland with everything, even kitchen knives if needed, to the last man, woman, and child.

  An armada of American ships and thousands of Marines, soldiers, and sailors were already on their way to Japan, and the men were ready to lay down their lives in the invasion, to end the war.  When news came that the bomb had been dropped, they (and all Americans) broke out in celebration.  All knew then that the war would be over.  As people who worked on the atomic project said:  ""It was a race, just a race.  The first nation to get that bomb would win the war.""

  The Japanese peace faction saw the bomb as a route to ending the war as well.  Navy Minister Yonai called it ""a gift from heaven.""  Japanese scientists had been working on an atomic bomb themselves, and they determined that the bomb at Hiroshima (an industrial war products city) was a uranium bomb requiring a long time to make.  They gambled that it was the only one.  Without surrender, three days later the plutonium bomb (fast to make) was dropped on Nagasaki, and the Japanese scientists saw that now the Americans could bring many more (seven more were on the way).

  The Japanese leaders took a vote on whether to end the war and surrender, and it was a tie.  War Minister Anami proposed national suicide, suggesting that the entire nation could be destroyed like a beautiful flower.  Emperor Hirohito broke the tie and ordered surrender.  These facts are from historians, many expertly-researched news articles, and from people who lived through those times, were on the scene, and experienced it all.

  Col. Paul Tibbets, an expert aviator and survivor of 25 harrowing bombing missions over Germany, was selected to lead the atomic effort to end the war as soon as possible without sacrificing more American lives.  He said, ""When you're fighting a war to win, you use every means at your disposal to do it.  Most writers have tried to find answers for the use of these atomic weapons.  The real answers lay in the thousands of graves from Pearl Harbor around the world to Normandy and back again.""

  Many hard decisions had to be made, as always when a nation is pulled into a war it had hoped to avoid.  Even Japanese admiral Yamamoto, who was ordered to plan the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, saw the futility of it, seeing America as ""a sleeping giant"" that could eventually outpace Japan in production of war weaponry and forces.  As those in the defense industry know, when in a war, a nation is forced to either 1) kill the enemy or 2) break his will to fight.  In reality, both are done as much as much as possible and as fast as possible.

  The development of a weapon so awesome was necessary to END THE WAR by breaking the will of the enemy to fight, in a war that had cost an estimated 900,000 American lives up to that time, and Japan was still fiercely fighting with many powerful methods of its own, including suicide pilots who inflicted terrible sinkings of American ships and loss of many American lives.  Let us remember that both Japan and Germany were also working on atomic bomb programs of their own, and this was a war that America had to win.",1409702400,3,3813,4.605654761904762

Outstanding performances by Robert Taylor as Paul Tibbets and Eleanor Parker.as his wife, Lucey. Tibbets was chosen to command a tight operational training base where everyone was sworn to secrecy regarding the nature of the operation, ie the use of a new bomb. The air crews were only informed of the target when in the air on the way to the drop zone. This secrecy and hard-line discipline required caused friction and uncertainty within the Tibbets's relationship. The stunning and under-rated Eleanor Parker is magnificent as she tries to be the supportive and loyal wife while she knows nothing of her husband's need to enforce harsh discipline. Robert Taylor portrays the grim determination of Tibbets to see the operation succeed from the start. His acting is magnificent, particularly in the cockpit scenes during the flight to the drop zone and culminating in the unbelievable comprehension as he watches the resultant mushroom cloud, This is truly a great picture with wonderful performances, well worth watching several times to catch nuances throughout the story.",1396224000,,1242,5.1840796019900495

557335,4,6303091962,"This pretty good movie tells the tale of the former country of Newfoundland and how some of its people participated in World War II. After the war Newfoundland became a province of Canada. But it was an independent dominion during the greatest conflict humanity has known. And it had strategic importance because it was about the closest part of North America to Europe. It was the jumping-off point for aircraft flying to the British Isles. Some of the first aircraft to fly to the battle theater instead of going by ship were Lockheed Hudsons. These were militarized Electra, 14-seat passenger planes. They were about as bad a warplane as you would expect from a non-purpose-built plane. But they could out-fly a submarine so they were vital to RAF Coastal Command in the Battle of the Atlantic. This film shows how they were hurried across in the winter season against all odds of success and how a number of individuals' lives were effected. The title is a bit grandiose but the rest of the film is typically Canadian in its understated characters, story and production.

I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was longer than it had to be to tell the story.
I noticed one glaring error (but did not let it affect my rating) and that was
the scene in which the airfield operator was repairing a piece of electronic equipment.
The board that he was working on showed a series of power transistors but the most
rudimentary transistor was not invented until after the war in 1947.

This movie did make me wish that some Hollywood producer would have the foresight
to make a Doc-u Drama on the Woman's Air Service Pilots  (WASP). There is a story that
is dieing to be told in a movie format. I only wish that I had the money to do it. :-)

This unintended picture of the difference between how men and women see marriage is the film's greater strength. The military aspect of the film is fascinating; the familial aspect is compelling.

The backdrop is WW2 and the devastation created by the U boats, the need for aircraft in wartime Europe and the losses incurred at the time.

So a true and reasonably accurate historical depiction, but what really brings this movie to life are the human stories that are expertly interwoven, how a simple stenographer is catapulted by the dictates of war into a position she did not choose and decidedly did not want, how the pilots were recruited and how their personal lives and trials are intertwined is not gimmicky for once, but well told, beleivably filmed and as a package draws the viewer completely into the period.

The politics of a remote civilian airfield being inundated by the powers that be, dictated by the US and potentially subsumed into the RAF while being in what is to become Canada form one of several subplots that are expertly woven into the film, in such a way that the viewer doesn't even realize until later how much they actually learned while being thoroughly entertained.

The only aspect I'd deduct for was the flying sequences, of which there weren't many shots taken of the outside of the aeroplanes, as the views when the aircraft were shown were obviously computer generated - not too tackily, but still obvious.

One of the unusual aspects for a modern war movie was the lack of blood and gore, though certainly referenced, it was as a backdrop, so there's absolutely no issue in this being a general family film.

As with any movie - it's very much about individual tastes, but in my opinion this ranks right beside ""until we meet again"" as an educational backdrop to a little know aspect of one of the greatest conflicts the world has ever known.",1290384000,9,1920,4.648967551622419

This is splendidly accomplished in this movie. Robert Taylor does a fine job as the colonel who cannot reveal his secret training to his wife which causes tensions to rise between them. Duty rises above family in this case and even though it does there is always questioning about how terrible war is. These questions are presented throughout the movie. A very dramatic and moving scene is the actual bombing of Hiroshima and the various reactions of the crew members to the carnage the have inflicted. There are no words just expressions which indicate what a terrible deed they did but in the context of a  World War also the necessity of what they did. Robert Taylor later utters a laconic ""God"" at witnessing what the crew has done and the power, destruction, suffering and  death they have caused. The ambiguity and dichotomy of that moment is later perfectly captured when he gives an official report saying ""results good"" and then somberly and reflectively repeats those words while pensively and mournfully watching the city burn to a crisp. A very powerful moment in an excellent movie.",1274659200,3,1256,4.919811320754717

Definitely a plus for history buffs.  Not much there for chick flick fans.  It was made close enough to the war to have some real interesting insights into the secrecy of the bomb project including the training of the crews in Silver Plate.

557526,3,6303091962,"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen.",1251849600,2,1825,4.603715170278638
557527,4,6303091962,"this movie did a great job of tieing in real life facts but it needed more of a plot. i could tell half way through how it was going to turn out but i had to rate it four stars because it just was fun to watch. but be ready for a long moive if you buy this one.

i also would have liked to see more of the germans view on things, it would have helped the plot and given it more of a well rounded point of view of the war.",1246147200,4,421,3.5268817204301075

We have to watch each and every supposed detail. It may not be accurate but it is watchable. By the way every occasionally the bomb shows up.

Warning this can be a tearjerker for people that are prone toward domestic bliss.

557529,4,6303091962,"This is an interesting depiction of Atlantic Ferry Operations out of Newfoundland in WWII and the creation of Ferry Command.  It is a two-part miniseries, with a run-time of 3 hours, but probably could have been edited to a good two-hour movie. It's a little slow at times and the editing is a little choppy.

The sub-plot love triangle between the main character Shelagh, her ex-boyfriend Airport Manager, and new boyfriend devil-may-care pilot sort of gets reduced to a workaholic woman trying to decide which one she has time for.

There are some historical inaccuracies which only a true aviation buff would notice (the DC-3 modified with turboprop engines made me cringe, and I'm also not sure why US Army Air Corps officers would show up in an AVRO Lancaster), and some modern-day expressions creep into the dialogue (did they really say ""We're screwed"" in WWII?).  The CGI special effects were mostly okay, but a couple of scenes where they pan into a wide shot of the airport looked just like a flight simulator video game.  If they couldn't get in a helicopter and film a real airport, they should have just chosen something else to do.

The show-case aircraft in the movie is the Lockheed Hudson, which is touted as a great airplane, but so many things go wrong with these brand new planes in the first ferry flight, that you have to wonder!  I don't know for sure, but it seems to me that they would have had oxygen masks for the crew rather than just a rubber hose to stick in their mouths. It's hard to tell if that's a point of historical accuracy or they were just doing it on the cheap! (a walk-around oxygen bottle would have made sense as well)

The cast is first-rate with Liane Balaban, Allan Hawco, and Richard E. Grant standing out. Joss Ackland does a convincing Churchill, and Kenneth Welsh interestingly portrays Lord Beaverbrook.

The DVD has only Night one and Night two, so you have to fast forward to view an individual scene, which is a little annoying.  All in all, above average for a TV miniseries (or two-night movie). Not a rollercoaster ride action-wise (the movie mostly gets off the ground only when the planes do), but history buffs will appreciate the telling of a little-known story.",1235088000,8,2224,4.694087403598972
557530,3,6303091962,"This Canadian mini-series centers around a little-remembered aspect of World War II. The British face a Nazi onslaught and are desperately short of planes. Canadian newspaper magnate turned cabinet member Lord Beaverbrook conceives a bold plan to fly them across the Atlantic from Newfoundland to Ireland. ""But that's impossible,"" everyone exclaims. Not so. With a motely crew of civilian volunteers including Americans, it can and will be done.
The first half of this mini-series moved along briskly. We're introduced to some of the flyers and their intrepid commander and the girl who will organize the operation and provide the love interest. Joss Ackland provides the Chrchill impersonation, complete with growling voice and huge cigar.
Unfortunately, the dramatic tension is not sustained in Part II. Once the pilots show they can indeed cross the Atlantic, the plot veers to infighting over who will control the operation and a poorly conceived love triangle that totally lacks any snap, crackle or pop.",1234224000,8,1009,5.352201257861635
