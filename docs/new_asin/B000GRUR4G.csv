2616592,5,B000GRUR4G,This product is a gift for a family memeber that loves this show. they will be very happy with this movie set. It is the best gift i could buy for this person. It is great. It is boxed in a collector tin and it is in excellent condition.,1174262400,,237,3.857142857142857
2616593,4,B000GRUR4G,"Well, it's been a long time coming, but Ralph and the red jammies have finally gotten the deluxe treatment! Every episode from its three-season run have made it into this little black box, complete with a replica of the instruction book for the suit's powers, a full-length cape, and the pilot episode for the Greatest American Heroine!

This show had a great little message - It's important to keep trying, even if we don't always know what we're doing.

And what better way to illustrate this than a high-school teacher who gets a suit with special powers from a group of intergalactic green guys? Nothing else even comes close!

Now I will admit, I wasn't expecting a lot from the instruction manual - much like on the tv show, there are no actual instructions. We get a page with ""Instructions"" on it, and on the next page there is a hologram cover that flips from English to the ""alien language"". The last part of the instruction book has the 6 paneled lights on it, and the book lights up with a flip of a switch on the back that illuminates the inner page, the tabs and the spine, which is pretty nifty. The packagers even put the batteries in the book for us - mighty nice of them! I would have preferred a replica of the instruction book from the second season, but that would skyrocket the price of this box set another $50.00 at least.

The cape is really for cosmetic admiring because the material is very thin...but it's a nice little extra.

As for the iron-on transfer, it's the exact same size as the emblem on the black box, roughly the size of your palm...not a big emblem which we were all hoping for.

One other feature that hasn't been mentioned is the marking ribbon inside the box. While it's not a huge extra, it can keep your place while watching each disc set - for the unorganized or forgetful watchers, this will help to keep track of which episode you're on.

The individual sleeves for the discs are slender, much like the box sets for Charlie's Angels or 7th Heaven - so if you were to break up the box and put these sleeves on a shelf, it's a space saver's dream.

Now on to the episodes themselves. Let's face the facts, like most of the tv shows of the 1980's, there is a lot of stock and reused footage from earlier shows that get spliced into other episodes - one of them had Ralph's schoolkids playing a concert clearly spliced over with footage from Woodstock. But does that stop me from watching these episodes over and over again? Absolutely not, it adds to the nostalgia!

However, there are a few glaring issues in a few episodes that haven't been brought up yet:

(1) Not all of the music from the original episodes was brought over into the DVD transfer. For example, during the episode ""Operation Spoilsport"", Ralph was sitting in a car and the aliens make a ""special dedication"" to Ralph over the radio - the song was ""Eve of Destruction"".

At the end of the episode, the aliens send another special song, ""It's a Beautiful Morning"". However, in the DVD treatment of this episode, other songs are used instead.

Also, in the episode ""The Shock Will Kill You"", when Ralph was magnetized and setting off Bill's car horn, he originally honked out the tune ""Shave and a Haircut"" - but the sound was removed altogether and it ruined the humor of that scene.

(2) The use of the name ""Hinkley"" from the first season was not put back into the first season episodes. It's common knowledge that this show debuted a mere 12 days before the assassination attempt on Former President Ronald Reagan, and as a result, Ralph's last name was either dubbed out, dubbed over, or changed completely (In one episode they call him Mr. Hanley). I would have expected these to be put back in, but probably for posterity's sake they were left as is.

Now for the last episode on the first season of the boxed set:

The Greatest American Heroine.

It was a cute idea, to have the powers of the suit transferred to a female character. Keep in mind, this was more of a reunion episode/pilot pitch for a new series; set 3 years after the last episode aired in 1983.

Out of every episode in the series, this is the hardest episode to watch because it is simply not entertaining. I'm positive that upon seeing this episode, no network wanted to pick up ""The Greatest American Heroine"", and the pilot never saw the light of day until now.

So what's the final verdict?

For any fan of the 1980's, this box set is worth the price...even with the shortcomings that have been mentioned.

Now a whole new generation of kids and adults can watch the antics of Bill Maxwell trying to keep Ralph from ruining yet another government issued vehicle with their trial-and-error experiments using the red jammies!

ENJOY!",1169683200,121,4725,4.535294117647059
2616594,4,B000GRUR4G,"Ralph Hinckley is definitely back in the house. I love the extras; the cape and the book-though I was a little disappointed in the book which many of my ""nerds"" out there would agree. I thought it was a full list of powers and abilities that even he never knew about. Kinda special, privy information the even they didn't get to do in the show. But it's not though it is an actual replica of the show prop (it does light up for real)so that's cool too. It has three ""pamphlets""-one talks about episodic content- that give accounts of like the ""behind the scenes"" people. I was put off alittle by the amount of dvd's (seven in all)to shuffle through-everything's marked, mind you. I just didn't think i'd be so many. There's like three one hour long shows per. I wish they had dvd's with more space. The packaging gives you a full detail of the episodes in each ""chapter"". I confess due to my busy schedule,I haven't had a chance to watch everything,like documentaries,(NOT THAT I CARE I JUST WANT TO SEE THE SHOW,LOL)well one and it was cool. The quality is really good. Though the added amusement factor is how ""cheesy"" the special effects look compared to ""SMALLVILLE"", ""X-MEN"",""HEROES"" and the like with more on the way. It's still hasn't lost it's luster though. The story dynamics are still great, funny,well-fleshed out, he presents realistic problems single parent with fiancee', teacher to highly dysfunctional kids then fact he's doesn't want or like the suit-I wouldn't either,you've seen him fly-that's just icing on the cake. He's like ""SUPERMAN"" with a ""SPIDER-MAN"" problems. ""THE GREATEST AMERICAN HEROINE"" STILL SUCKS. She's sexy but she makes you wanna just slap fire from her. I honestly think they should re-do or renew the show. We're a more sophisticated audience with superheroes coming out of the woodwork. It's the perfect time for a resurrection but in the interrim. ""Just take three steps and jump like you're jumpin' offa diving' board and hold your hands in front of you"" cause believe or not, he's back. You won't be disappointed-book aside and everything.",1168473600,3,2084,4.840336134453781
2616595,5,B000GRUR4G,"It is a wonderful set.

I enjoyed the show when it was on TV.

Now I can enjoy it one again.

The cape is great fun.",1168300800,,116,3.3846153846153846
2616596,4,B000GRUR4G,"The cape is very nice, but much skinnier than the one in the show. The iron on decal is very small, about 3 inches. The DVD transfer was not enhanced at all. The quality of the DVD recordings is about what you would expect from a top of the line VHS tape. It is in the 4:3 TV format with 2 channel stereo sound. The alien instruction manual was a nice idea, but you probably could not sell it for 50 cents at a yard sale. Is the collectors set worth getting, yes.  If you liked the show, this will really give you the feeling of sitting in front of the old TV like you did 25 years ago.",1167177600,43,586,3.9243697478991595
2616597,4,B000GRUR4G,"How excited I was to finally find in the mail the Greatest American Hero collectors set. I opened the box with trembling fingers in hope and anticapation.

 The first thing I looked at once I dumped the contents on my bed was the T-shirt decal.  Yikes.  Barely 3 inches across. Ok.  Let's move on.

 Next was a white box containing what I hoped was the instruction manual.  Sure enough...there it was.....at last. Cool lights!!  But wait!!!  It only had a couple pages to it and I couldn't read some of the text.  Yet another disapointment.  Plus only one page of a table of contents!!!!  Now I truly new what Ralph was going through!!!!  Well,  time to move on to the next item in the box.

 The Cape!!!!  Wow!!!!  It's a very nice piece of clothing!  Strings tie together in a knot around my neck and it fell almost to my knees.  Beautiful.  ""But does it work?"" I ask myself.  The instruction manual is hopeless, but might as well give this thing a try.

 So I went outside of my two story house and got my ladder out.  I climbed up to the roof and readied myself for a dream come true.  Took several deep breaths.  Closed my eyes......ummmmm....that's not going to work very well...I decided to keep my eyes open. I took three long steps like the kid showed Ralph in the first episode of the film footage and leaped off the building into the air...I was flying!!!!!!....NOT.  I fell the two stories into a big pile of leaves.  The cape didn't work!!!!  The instruction manual might have had working instructions in it but it appeared to be broken, so no help there. I guess I'll have to wait for the aliens to come along and give me one themselves.  Oh, well....some day.

 I now have plenty of time to review the DVD's from the entire season as I sit and recover from my injuries from my plunge.

 So, in conclusion I have to say that this collectors pack is great to add to your collection, but the contents don't work as well as Ralphs suit did.

The DVD Film footage of Ralph is incredible!!!

Great value,  Great nostalgia,  Great fun.

Buy it.  But don't try it.",1164931200,133,2071,4.384615384615385

2616622,4,B000GRUR4G,"When I first watched this series as a child in the early eighties, I highly enjoyed partly from the catchy theme song and the cast especially William Katt (Ralph Hinkley, a special education high school teacher); Colleen Sellecca (Pam, his lawyer girlfriend, fianc and wife) and of course Robert Culp (Bill Maxwell F.B.I. agent). The series was created by the late Stephen Cannell who wrote many great television drama series beside this one. Supporting cast included Michael Pare and Faye Grant as his students.

The first season was set about at his high school who takes a fateful trip to desert. The premise of a spaceship which delivers a special red suit nicknamed the magic pajamas to Ralph Hinkley is a hard premise to swallow at first. Katt, Sellecca and Culp play believable and likable characters who get mixed in with it. The first two seasons were strong but the last one wasn't as much.

The set comes with 9 DVDs and includes a special by Stephen Cannell about the series. The series would have ended later if they had followed Cannell's advice and consultation. Still I enjoyed watching the series again on my laptop with guest appearances by June Lockhart (Lassie); Robert Hastings; Bob Saget (Full House); Christine Belford; Sandra Kerns; Clayton Moore; David Paymer; Terrence McNally; Elizabeth Hoffman; Joe Mantegna; Michael O'Leary; and more.",1470528000,,1363,5.0265486725663715

2616673,5,B000GRUR4G,"I had been looking for this series for some time, and found it at Amazon. Com.  The delivery time was as I have grown to expect, 2 or more days prior to the date set for delivery.
  As far as the Greatest American Hero Series.  It's a BUY!!  When it ran in prime time, I never got to see an episode.  Sound like an untruth?  NOT!  Due to work schedules and family time schedules, a lot of TV wasn't an option.  My only exposure to the series was the Theme Song, which stuck in my mind each time I heard it on the radio.  We have only viewed about 1/2 of the episodes, and they are ""to live for""!
  The special effects aren't 3rd Millennia, but then they were made in the early 1980's.  The effects are good, not quite like today's computer generated live-animation.  The story lines are believable, and for us, are able to bring us into the story lines as near participants rather than observers.  I enjoy watching movies, TV programs and the like where I don't have to think about the plot and story line to follow it.  This series has the ability to entertain without what is prevalent in most of today's movies and television, extreme violence, sexual situations and profanity.  The series has the ability to bring a story line across without using those elements because of the lack of talent of the writers and producers, and probably most of the actors.
  If you enjoy TV the way it was or want to see what good family entertainment was in the last millennia, then this is the one for you.

2616749,4,B000GRUR4G,"This amusing drama that debuted in the Spring of 1981 and ran on ABC from 1981 to 1983 about an ordinary school teacher, Ralph Hinkley(William Katt) who becomes extraordinary after an encounter with extraterrestrials which leaves him with a red power suit that transforms him into a superhero!

Unfortunately, when Ralph loses the suit's instruction manual, Ralph must learn by trial and error to control the capabilities and powers of his magic suit to fight the battle against injustice and crime. With the help of his attorney girlfriend Pam Davidson (Connie Sellecca) and FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp), the world's most unlikely flying crime fighter gets tangled in 1 outrageous adventure after another!

THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it every Wednesday at 8PM just before watching THE FALL GUY at 9PM and then DYNASTY at 10PM when they were all part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up, but then the ratings on this show took a turn for the worse in the Fall of 1982 when THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was moved to Fridays which resulted in THE FALL GUY being moved to 8PM and DYNASTY moving to 9PM on Wednesdays which was kind of like THE FALL GUY taking over the 8PM time slot from THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO and DYNASTY taking over the 9PM time slot from THE FALL GUY just like when THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was moved from 9PM to 8PM while DALLAS was moved to 10PM to 9PM every Friday night on CBS when THE INCREDIBLE HULK abruptly in mid season back in the mid Fall of 1981, due to budget cuts & a change in management at CBS since THE INCREDIBLE HULK had originally been the 8PM time slot as part of CBS's Friday night line up.

Therefore, the Dukes took over the 8PM time slot from the Hulk and DALLAS took over the 9PM time slot from the Dukes, but at one time THE INCREDIBLE HULK was shown at the same time slot as THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO back in the Spring of 1982 when CBS had brought THE INCREDIBLE HULK back on the air temporarily in May of 1982 to finish off the Hulk's remaining 2 episodes, which were ""Slaves"" and ""A Minor Problem"", but the Hulk was overshadowed quite a bit by Ralph since THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 8PM time slot on CBS conflicted with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's 8PM time slot on ABC on Wednesday nights along with the fact that THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was still in its honeymoon phase of the show while THE INCREDIBLE HULK's honeymoon phase was pretty much gone along with the fact that THE INCREDIBLE HULK had the most expensive special-effects on TV at the time which also got too expensive to keep running the show, due to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was President.

I also used to watch GREATEST AMERICAN HERO every morning on FX until they took it off the air back in the Summer of 1996.",1400630400,,2816,4.494140625

2616762,1,B000GRUR4G,"The Greatest American Hero is a charming and unlikely prospect for a successful TV series. And yet, it works spectacularly well, thanks to William Katt, Robert Culp and Connie Sellecca's believable performances; proof positive that when the ideal cast is in place anything is possible. Believe it or not - the series still holds up remarkably well.

This box set does not. The Greatest American Hero was previously released by Starz/Anchor Bay on home video in individual seasons. This set comes to us via Mill Creek - a company with a notorious reputation for shoddy DVD authoring. I have the Anchor Bay editions. They're not perfect, but they lack the incredible amount of edge enhancement and troublesome compression issues of this set. Anchor Bay's editions have eye-popping color and a good solid amount of fine detail present. This release lacks virtually all of those virtues. Colors are faded - badly. The compression issues are a disaster - blotchy color, video noise, tiling, background distortions, edge enhancement - virtually any anomaly you can think of is present. A colossal waste of time and money. These discs are a Frisbee. Fling!

Again, Anchor Bay's individual seasons are far from perfect. But they are light-years ahead of this pointless repackaged/reissued set. DO NOT BUY THIS!",1398556800,22,1302,5.136792452830188

So this complete set is on 9 disks and contains all 43 episodes including the un-aired ones.  However it does not include the Greatest American Heroine.

Anchor Bay Entertainment company released the complete series in DVD format in Region 1 for the first time during 2005. Additionally, on October 3, 2006, they released a special 13-disc boxed set that includes all 43 episodes of the series as well as other bonus material. However, both the individual DVD sets and the complete boxed set are missing original performances by Mike Post and Joey Scarbury whenever the song concerned originated by another artist. As of 2009, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

On October 14, 2009, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment company had acquired the rights to several Stephen J. Cannell series including The Greatest American Hero. They subsequently re-released the first season as well as a complete series box set on May 18, 2010. Season 2 was re-released on October 12, 2010.

On November 10, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment released The Greatest American Heroine TV movie on DVD.

The Greatest American Heroine

During 1986, the original principal cast reunited for a pilot movie for a new NBC series to be named The Greatest American Heroine, which did not result in a new series, and the pilot was never broadcast by NBC. Ultimately, the pilot was reedited as an episode of the original series (complete with original opening credits and theme), and added to syndication sets of the original series, for which it is the final episode. Immediately after the beginning credits, the episode's title card is superimposed over a nighttime view of the Los Angeles skyline, reading ""The Greatest American Hero"" before appending the letters ""i n e"" individually to the sound of the NBC chimes. Once famous, Ralph hosted Saturday Night Live and became a regular guest of The Tonight Show both of which are NBC series.

The pilot movie reveals that several years after the final episode, Ralph's secret identity was finally revealed to the public, resulting in his becoming a celebrity. This angers the aliens who gave him the suit, and they charge him with finding a new hero to wear the costume and use its powers for fighting evil. Once the transfer is made, they explain, all memory of Ralph's exploits will be purged from the world's memory and only to be remembered only by Ralph, Pam, and Bill.

Bill begins their search by researching people with desired hero qualities, but Ralph finds a young woman named Holly Hathaway (Mary Ellen Stuart), an elementary school teacher who spends her off-hours time looking for lost kittens, raising environmental awareness, and serving as a foster mother. The rest of the episode deals with her learning how to use the suit with Bill Maxwell's guidance, and the pair trying to develop a working relationship

Yes, the awkwardness around Ralph Hinkley's last name right around the Reagan assassination attempt by a guy with the same, unusual last name is quirky.

Now, keep in mind that I don't have any kind of hearing problems.  That being said, I am latin american and spanish is my natural language.  I understand english perfectly when written, but I still have some issues when hearing it, since I'm more used to hearing spanish than anything else.  That's why I watch movies in english with subtitles also in english.  The lack of subtitles in spanish doesn't matter much to me, although it means I can't lend it to any of my spanish-speaking friends, who are less fluid in english than I am.  But they could have easily included english subtitles.

2616854,5,B000GRUR4G,"This is just a review of the series, not the collectable packaging.

The series was created to ride the wave of popularity (and in some ways spoof) the original Superman movie, which came out a few years before this aired.  The premise was a regular guy is given a suit that gives him super powers (by aliens)but he loses the instructions so he has no idea how it really works.  He teams up with an FBI agent and his attorney girlfriend to fight crime.  So, it is really part superhero, part buddy cop, and part comedy.

The show aired in the very early 1980s.  As such the special effects were pretty cheesy, and the writing in some areas are hilarious today for different reasons.  For example the kids they were trying to portray as tough or bad were far different then than would be done now.  Also, many of the story lines were cold war themed given the era.  Because of that if you did not at least grow up around that time you probably will not get all of the references.  That said the show was very good, and is one that really stands the test of time.

What I personally liked about the show is that it really never tried to take itself too seriously.  And while it did go off on some strange tangents (like the electricity monster episode) it managed to stay entertaining throughout its run.  I think all three of the main actors did great jobs with their characters.  William Katt really did feel ridiculous in the suit, and that came across in his performance.  Robert Culp was great as the chauvinistic my way or the highway FBI agent, and Connie Sellica was more than just eye candy on the show, many times playing the ""straight man"" role.  As different as the characters were, it seemed all the actors had very good chemistry which came across in the performances, and you bought that the characters really cared about each other.  And the relationship between the characters was really what made the series work.

Some reviews mention that the music was not the same as when originally aired.  I was too young when the show was actually on TV to remember any of the music other than the main theme, however as is the case with many older shows it likely ran into copyright issues and had to change some of the songs that were played.  Chances are it will not be an issue for a lot of people, but it may be for some.  Personally I would rather have the series available on DVD without the original music than not have it at all.  The only unfortunate thing about the series is that it never had a proper ending.  It only had a 13 episode final season, and the way it ended seems like it was cancelled abruptly halfway through season three.  So the final episode of the series really feels just like any other.",1361664000,3,2725,4.404

Anyway, with the Orignal Set that I have, has the Finial Eposide of the Series Titled "" The Greatest American Heroine "".  This is the Eposoide to where the little Green Guy's tell Ralph & Pam that now that everyone knows about Ralph and the Super Suit, Ralph MUST give Up the Super Suit by giving it to someone else. Once Ralph gives up the Super Suit, then where Ralph and the Super Suit is concerned, ALL will be Forgotten, except for Pam & Ralph Hinkley!  I wish that this Eposoide was included with this Boxed Set, because I really like that Eposiode.

This was truly an enjoyable and very curious experience.

However, the pack itself has some shortcomings. First, the box is just a housing for the individual DVD's, which are themselves accommodated in individual paper sleeves.

The first thing I noticed was that a one-inch chunk and a smaller piece of the cheap plastic DVD box had broken off top, near the binding. I opened it up and checked out the disks - which, I'm happy to say, were all in ""new"" condition - not a scratch! That's primarily what I was concerned about - I didn't care much if there was some minor damage to the packaging, as long as the disks play well.
As for the show itself, it's awesome! I was a huge fan of this show when I was 13. I recently went back and watched the whole series on Netflix (but the buffering was a pain in the rear), and I wasn't disappointed. At first I thought maybe the show would be too campy or make me want to weep with embarrassment, but upon watching it, I was pleasantly surprised! The show was entertaining, funny, had a clever script, and some poignant moments as well. They just don't make quality family shows like that anymore.

This DVD was a disappointmend as they were many ""freezes"" in both the audio and video, not only in the pilot but also the second episode. Never watched the rest but returned it to Amazon for an exchange, which I received promptly. The pilot played a little better this time, but the second show was again almost impossible to watch because of constant freezes. At one point, it froze all together. That's when I decided to buy the COMPLETE SERIES and to my surprise, it not only contained the pilot but the picture and audio played beautifully and seemed of a much better quality than the DVDs of the 1st season.

2616920,2,B000GRUR4G,"This review is for the packaging and not the actual show.

I guess one should always remember that you get what you pay for and with this Mill Creek Entertainment version that couldn't be anymore truthful.

Amazon did a great job in getting this here in one day. Opened up the shipping box and proceeded to open up the box set. First thing a little piece of black plastic pops out. This was part of the plastic box that had broke off. Next I spot the discs sitting in their paper sleeves. That immediately didn't sit well as they are in my opinion horrible for protecting discs and I found that out immediately upon inspecting the discs. Out of the 9 discs, 5 are damaged with scratches. 2 are lightly scratched with them getting progressively worse looking with the final 2 looking like something had been rubbing against them causing fairly severe damage.

Will they play? Well at this point I'm not willing to even try because when I purchase new I expect new. Now I do place some of the blame on myself in that I should have read which company had made this box set and if I had I would know from past experience of purchasing Mill Creek Entertainment sets that they really skimp on the protection/packaging and I would not have purchased this particular set.

Edited to add:

Amazon quickly sent a replacement and surprise, the replacement also is damaged. This time not as bad as the scratches are light (they should play) but never will I purchase Mill Creek Entertainment sets again.

Otherwise the product was as advertised and the episodes are as nostalgically great as I remember. The second disk explores the double edged sword of a dilemma that faces the hero, is the fight worth the risk and danger to others? Is the battle against evil corny or courageous? Why not ask a hero of old, The 1952-1954 Lone Ranger. John Hart, provides a gentlemanly foil for Ralph's (William Katt) mental cuts and parries. And a few tears for those of us who grew up, as Ralph did, with The Lone Ranger, Tonto, and Silver righting wrongs without reward. Robert Culp's protrayal of Bill Maxwell is a delight throughout the series. His craftsmanship produces a curmudgeon with a heart of gold and some powerful action and narrative moments. The aliens are way behind modern visual art, but back then it was amazing that Ralph even flew. Don't watch too closely, the flying sequences are reused more than a few times with different blue screen shots and with same landing sequences. Still, setting that aside, the moral issues the series tackled, along with the humor and adventure, make this one of those classics that it is great to come back to.

If not for the surround sound unit my son installed I would not have heard it very well.  Picture quality was good and sound quality was good though.

Overall I gave it 5 stars for the hard to find content and not the extra stuff.  (we did not even watch the bonus interviews.)

There are episodes in season 2 where Pam and Ralph are already married and also in season 3 before the episodes where they get engaged and then married. Were they originally aired that way or did the dvd manufacturers get them out of order? Are they possibly in production order rather than the order they were aired? Wondered if anyone else noticed or has an explanation.

2617022,5,B000GRUR4G,Thank you so much for this box set.  Never realized that it would include the original alien book that he was supposed to follow as well as a cape.. Too funny. Awesome box too... Was Overly impressed with this purchase and product and the price was GREAT too!,1265587200,,259,4.395833333333333
2617023,3,B000GRUR4G,"This is such a fun show and the packaging is very cute...but...beware of the batteries.
Why the manufacturers thought it wise to install the batteries is a mystery. I had to return two purchases because the batteries in the notebook were so badly corroded that the entire box smelled awful. Your best bet? Order it used. Hopefully some previous owner will be smart enough to clean it up and remove the nasty batteries.",1263859200,8,418,4.739726027397261

The DVDs are in order, but the covers don't list which series they belong to, so that you have to double check you're watching them in the right order. Crack up on the cape.

2617027,5,B000GRUR4G,"Even though I was born by December of 1981, I had the chance the watch most of the re-run for this great TV show.

Since I'm now a teacher and also a sci-fi lover I truly think this series represent most of my own personality, starting by Scarbury's ""Believe or Not"" which I guess it deals with imagination, innocence, love and dreams (my favorite topics in a way)

However I have to talk about the DVD box set, not about my personal feelings and the way it deeply affects me as a grown up child.

The box is simply awesome, made of some metal material it gives the entire show (3 seasons) plus a manual for your super alien suit (ha ha) and it also comes with a reproduction of the greatest american hero's cape and a sticker featuring the suit logo.

What else can  I say? believe or not it's simply the best TV show that portraits naivity along with values and hero type adventures.",1242000000,,885,4.307228915662651
2617028,1,B000GRUR4G,"Anchor Bay Entertainment has released the complete series on DVD for Region 1.  In addition, on October 3, 2006, they released a special 13-disc boxset that contains all 43 episodes of the series as well as other bonus collectors items.

NOTE: Both the individual DVD sets and the complete Box Set are missing original performances by Mike Post and Joey Scarbury whenever the song originated by another artist.  (It's likely Stephen J. Cannell productions either failed to obtain the copyrights to release these songs with the soundtrack, or the same company did not wish to bother paying the original artists their royalties to keep the show intact.)

Case in point: in the Pilot episode, in the Bus scene when the class is headed for a field trip, Joey Scarbury sang a version of ""Help me Rhonda"" by the Beach Boys.  Later in the same episode he sang ""Rocket Man"" by Elton John.  Both these and others like them are completely missing from the entire series, and for why?  Because Stephen J. Cannell productions would rather make money than actually keep the show as it was.

Thank you, but no thank you.",1241740800,28,1106,4.7539267015706805

The characters and story lines are very memerable and make you feel part of each epesode. Both series have action, comedy, romance and hidden mystery which you can not help but be intrieged by and want to learn more and more from the adventure of each  piece of the puzzel.

Re-watching Greatest American Hero as an adult, I realize my perception as a child was correct. It is CHEESY... but ya know, sometimes I just wish we could turn back the clock a little and have Maxwell Smart, Steve Austin and Ralph Hinkley over for borad games in the wood panel den.",1202428800,2,535,4.254901960784314
2617059,5,B000GRUR4G,"I originally heard about the Greatest American Hero DVD series set from a friend who showed me the one that he had purchased. The attention to detail and the fact that it included so many extra items made me go and get one for myself.

First of all, this is a numbered boxed set. There are only 20,000 made total. That right there makes it a collectible. Second, it was amazing what they decided to include in the set. You get a cape, which is acceptable looking (mine is still sealed in the plastic bag). You get an iron-on transfer. It's kind of cool, but I would never apply it to anything (partially for fear of looking like the biggest geek ever). Lastly, and arguably the coolest part of the set, besides the DVD's themselves!) would be the battery-powered instruction manual with details that are exactly like the one seen in the pilot episode of the series itself. All of this comes in a nice metal tin too. Wow!

As far as the actual episodes are concerned, it is great to be able to see all of the original episodes (in order) of this awesome series that has been taken off the air long, long ago.

I highly recommend purchasing this DVD box set. It is: collectible, cool, and hours of enjoyment.",1201219200,4,1206,4.423423423423423

Some folks expect too much :)  Nice metal box to hold all of the discs, the cape, the instruction book, and even a few extras that we want to add :) Thanks Amazon - Greatest Gift Set of the Greatest American Hero.

8134129,2,B000GRUR4G,"The rating for the entire series is 4 or 5 stars, but recent production DVD quality is very poor. The original DVDs have much better video quality and packaging.  Ive noticed that recent syndicated reuns are using the highly compressed videos which are almost unwatchable.  Have not watched Primes videos, which may be better, even though the pilot is missing. NONE of the DVDs or VCRs are licensed with the incidental  music as originally broadcast, such as Eve of Destruction .

This complete series set is a recent production, although the packaging looks very similar to the original sets. The single or two season sets of recent manufacture have packaging that looks different. The originals never had an all in one set, and there was no blue design at the top which looks like the blu-ray logo.  The original DVDs by Ancor Bay do have the asian looking symbol in the center, as on the complete series set.  They were made about 2006 or earlier, so they are not current production, although you can still find them readily available as new, old stock. Their video quality is about the same as originally broadcast, and better than most old shows on DVD.

If it turns out that you like most of the episodes, as I do, Im warning you that your Jones will make you purchase them again as the Ancor sets and you will throw out the recently made set(s).  So I paid twice. This complete series set would be well worth the fifty bucks if the production problems were fixed.",1525478400,,1470,4.605363984674329
