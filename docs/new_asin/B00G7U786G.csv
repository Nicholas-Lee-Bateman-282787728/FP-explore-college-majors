The extras on the DVD also include one additional short riffed by another artist, which is a nice bonus.",1471392000,,279,4.490196078431373

I'm a very busy executive in door to door fishing bait sales so I don't have a lot of time to spend here, check this out.

8621348,5,B00G7U786G,"Look. I love MST3k, probably more than you do, but it's lost it's luster a bit over the years. After you've seen every episode more than 20 times, you can't help but wish that someone was making more of them. These guys are doing exactly that. If you watch this, you will love it.",1383264000,7,280,4.203703703703703
8621349,5,B00G7U786G,"It's rare that you can so perfectly pinpoint the moment a creative enterprise breaks free of it's inspirations and comes into it's own.  For the team behind fan-favorite riffers Incognito Cinema Warriors, that moment is now.  Whether you're a long-time fan of riffing shows like ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" or a new-comer to the art of mockery, you'll know that the focus is always on the film riffing itself.  Sure, everyone loves the laughs from the host-segments or interesting live-action arcs, but the main even always takes place in the theater.  As of episode 204, this is no longer the case.

In this feature-length release, the framing device the creators have crafted leaps to the forefront with increasingly impressive production value, writing, and action.  The gold is truly to be found in the original content on this release.  A new antagonist group is revealed as the series rushes towards it's final episodes of the season.  Highlights include a dialog on the social ramifications of the zombie uprising, and an interrogation sequence that must be seen to be believed.  While the film riffing scenes continue to be top-notch, it's great to see Rikk and the bots really flex their comedic muscle in front of the cameras this round.

There's a popular concept that states an artist or group thereof can survive and even thrive with 1000 die-hard fans, who will consistently support and buy whatever they offer.  This most recent release only further solidifies my spot among the ranks of the ICWXP 1000, and I'd encourage anyone reading this to take the plunge and join us.",1383264000,7,1591,4.966037735849056
8621350,4,B00G7U786G,"It's been nearly a year since we last heard from our heroes known as Incognito Cinema Warriors XP, otherwise known as life in the zombie apocalypse that's not in The Walking Dead.

While Rifftrax just mocks bad movies, and Cinematic Titanic heads towards the sunset, ICWXP reminds us that the host segments, the comedy in between the movies, are very important. That's how we see Rick Wolf, TopsyBot 5000, Johnny Cylon, and Flux Namtari deal with being trapped in a movie theater in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.

The episodes are becoming more ambitious, too. When season 2 started, the DVDs ran only 45 minutes. This new DVD runs a whopping 90 minutes, not including extras.
 In ""Fahrenheit Cine-A-Sorrow"", there's some changes, like TopsyBot getting a new head and the lobby getting a new candy counter. The zombies seem to communicate through long moans that are actually profound discussions about existence...or World War Z. However, there's also a new group of villains with their own agenda

The new DVD also takes on two shorts. The first, ""The Haunted Mouth"" features Cesar Romero as B. Plaque daring kids to take care of their teeth. Rick and his bots get in some good riffs, even adding a few obscure references. The other short, ""Power to Serve"" talks about how great coal-fired power plants are.

The show also preserves MST3K's old tradition of funny host segments. Seeing Cylon interrogate one of the Ludovico lackeys is hilarious. This new DVD is worth the wait, and will likely get fans waiting when the next installment will arrive.

The extras include how fans paid for the new candy counter and Topsybot's new head, plus how Zed was brought back. Rikk's audio commentary should also be heard, as he explains the long process of putting this DVD together",1383264000,6,1779,4.874172185430464
