8393588,4,B003BGXH9G,"This was an excellent card. Everything was very balanced. The opening match was a good start for the night. Everything was really good and sold. Not a bad match on the card. The only reason this gets four stars from me. Is that I felt like Daniels and Castagnoli should have been allowed to do more. They should have been allowed to get the crowd more excited. The crowd was very jacked to see both men. It would have been nice to see both men. Get in some more stuff, and leave the crowd chanting for them like a cult. Granted the main a event is what thats normal for. But I think it would have been a good lead in. Get the crowd just a bit hotter. Main event was breath taking and really just epic. Nigel and Danielson can really work like few others can. They left it all in the ring. Excellent match. The crowd for the record is general a bit quite. Because thats how we are in MN. It takes a bit to shake us out of what I like to call. Japanize crowd state of mind. Over all buy this dvd. Its an excellent dvd to have in your collection.",1345248000,,1043,4.067961165048544
