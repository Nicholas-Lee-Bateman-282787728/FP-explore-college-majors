1569815,2,B00005JPI6,"A former employer once rejected a recommendation stating ""if those changes are necessary, there are better businesses to be in."" Such is the philosophy of Mr. Sorkin, the creative half of Team '69. He just can't resist the compulsion to show everyone he is the smartest man in ""the room"" and still owns the patent on glib.  He and Mr. Schlamme were given the opportunity to present real insight and courage (e.g., a Jeopardy parody with Jesus, Mohammed and Moses). Instead they gave NBC nothing more than a Public Service Announcement with commensurate ratings.

Nevertheless the effort is not totally without merit. I believe one actor will rise to ""A List"" heights from the long forgotten ashes of Studio 60. Sarah Paulson where have you been? You deserve better, don't be afraid to ask for it!",1161043200,5,796,4.845588235294118

1569932,4,B00005JPI6,"Some of Aaron Sorkin's shows are not as good as others. Studio 60 is not as good as West Wing, for instance. However, it's still a show worth watching, if only to play ""What other Aaron Sorkin shows was this actor in?"" One of the reasons this fails to be as good is because it got bogged down in the preachy and wordy elements without allowing more of the plot to develop. Certainly Sorkin shows have a dialogue rich backdrop at all times, but in WW, for instance, the plot was moving somewhere (in different arcs) but in Studio 60, things took too long to truly develop and thus suffered a bit. However, there are many interesting people within and a number of great sight gags. The Nevada two parter is also particularly interesting.",1484092800,2,735,4.492537313432836

Unfortunately, these shows take time to gather a committed following and Studio 60 is one of those great shows that just didn't acquire enough viewers quickly enough to keep it on the air and it was gone to soon.

1570254,4,B00005JPI6,"I was going to give it a three, but as a Sorkin show.  It's still better than most shows out there.  It's the bottom rung of Sorkin's stuff, though.

The writing isn't as smart as West Wing, Sports Night or Broadcast News, and the cast is pretty uneven.  Oddly, I don't mind Sorkin's vendetta against Christians as much as the tokens he throws in to mollify we Christians. Harriet in this and BN's girl don't live it, so better not to have them. Ainsley in WW was terrific, though more the right token than a Christian one.

The top billing actors were great; the bottom billing were just ""eh.""  For a cast of comedians, they weren't. And Ron and his sidekick, for comedy writers, weren't remotely funny.

Again, better than 90% of shows out there, this one seemed half-baked. Normally, Sorkin's choices are smart and snappy. Here you're thinking, ""eh, could have been better.""

This sounds like a negative view, but I watched the whole thing and would have enjoyed it immensely if it had been anyone other than Sorkin, but he's raised the bar too high for himself to clear with this one.",1463529600,,1088,4.572164948453608

Many of the issues that the series did have I think would have been worked out if it had another season, such as a more even amount of time spent on various themes.

I did not regret spending the money even though it ends after the first season.  It ends at a spot that while I wish there was more, I don't feel like I'm cheated out of a ending either.",1442880000,,719,4.151079136690647

This show had everything, two superb leads with amazing chemistry, a strong supporting cast and excellent writing.  I missed Sports Night but wished I hadn't.  I guess I blinked?!?!?!?!?  The wife and I got heavily invested in Sorkin's Newsroom, I guess we are doomed to invest in shows like this.  Looking at Sorkin's batting average, I amazed The West Wing was a hit.

1570623,5,B00005JPI6,"Aaron Sorkin is a Television God....and although his incredibly well done program in EVERY WAY, 'Studio 60', lasted only one season, due to ""ratings"" (the Nielsen ratings are an indicator of the viewing habits of a largely ill-informed American public, and NOT a barometer for the quality of programming!), I bought this for my own personal selection and enjoyment, whenever television lacks good programs to view ~ which, as it turns out these days, especially with ""reality shows"", is complete rubbish nearly every evening! The scripts, the dialogue (a Sorkin specialty!), the lavish sets, the incredible realism of the production, timing, and people required for excellent Prime Time television, the AMAZING acting/actors, and the famous ""Quixotic"" storylines of Aaron Sorkin ~ it's all here in 'Studio 60 from the Sunset Strip', whenever I (or you!) want it! I am personally in mourning, because after HBO's three-season run of Sorkin's 'The Newsroom' (the VERY BEST that I have ever seen on television) that just ended, Sorkin has said that he prefers not to write for the demands of the television medium now!

1570686,4,B00005JPI6,"Wow, Mr. Sorkin is brilliant, albeit dense with information and story plots. This series covers the amazing spectrum of drug addiction, race and sexual politics in the workplace, studio politics,the steamy Hollywood environment, quick talking, deep thinking studio executives, celebrity hook-ups, charity work, religious influence, Nevada's unique values that allow gaming and prostitution but not pot, animal cruelty, single parent child birth, developing revenue streams in Macau with Chinese business consortium's, gossip columnists influence, the relentless press, Vanity Fair's access and influence, the jargon of a hot set doing comedy sketches, not skits, sketches, cold opens, Saturday Night Live-like productions, the 40 second page, ratings, marketing, sales, the use of big or unfamiliar words by ivy league grads who run this uber fast environment of 14 hour work days, celebrities and wrap parties.
Sorkin had to actually have lived in this ratified environment to write, direct and produce this speeding freight train of a series. Guest appearances by celebrity heavyweights are fun. The series bogs down a few times but hey, dying is easy, comedy is hard! Unfortunately, the network pulls the rug out from underneath the show and it belly flops at the end with a bunch of unresolved story threads dangling and leaves the viewer with an unsatisfied take-away after being hurled through space, time and emotional swings thanks to crisp writing, acting and production. I suppose I can always binge watch News Room which also abruptly ends. I suppose buying into a Sorkin production is like trying to quickly start and stop a nuclear reactor. It can be done, but it doesn't always end gracefully. Good show, wish there was more...",1425081600,,1741,5.357664233576642

I was confused at why this was cancelled after one season.  Coming off the success of the iconic West Wing, with the expected large cast of great actors and  interesting starting point of the back story of an SNL type show. While the plotting got a bit hinky towards the end, everything else remained top notch.  If you want to, give it shot now. As a real plus, check for the multitude of great guest stars.

Why didn't it succeed when it was first aired?  Even with all that was wonderful about it? With many of the same things that made West Wing such a delight, why didn''t Studio 60 succeed?

You cared about the people in West Wing and watching it made it us all hopeful that the people that populate the Whitehouse really do care that much, that they are that much smarter than the rest of us.  That the country is in good hands.

Now Studio 60, with all it has going for it, is about really pretty, rich, people who whine.  Nothing that makes you feel good about yourself or them.  And it suffered from conparison with West Wing.  Time has created distance and it is well worth a second look.",1408752000,,1245,4.360869565217391

Aaron Sorkin is the closet thing my generation will get to Shakespeare. The guy is brilliant.

Where West Wing studied how two extremes (right and left) can work together to govern the American People, Studio 60 studies pretty much the same relationship but this time Sorkin through in God and atheists and put it Behind the scenes of Studio 60""... a Friday Night, West Coast, Saturday Night Live.

The only problem with this show is that we only got one season... I would have loved to get another 3 or 4 seasons, but it was canceled.  On one hand, I know that it was just too smart. And on the other hand I have to admit, the first half of the season went all the right places with purpose and direction, and the 2nd half of the season didn't seem to have a clear vision of where it wanted to land. It still excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.",1402099200,,1028,4.394736842105263

1571074,2,B00005JPI6,"Please note that I have not yet watched the episodes or extras; this comment is on the packaging only. Apologies for my ignorance of proper packaging terminology.

It looks like this was maybe a remaindered item: There's a cut about an inch long through the bar code on the back of the cardboard outer sleeve that holds the discs, which extends through the front side of the plastic case/sleeve/box of discs 5 and 6. The cut's about 3/4"" long on the case, and runs through the 6 of Studio 60, but isn't anywhere near the disc itself.

Also, three of the hubs?/spindles?/thingies? that hold the discs in place within the cases are missing enough petals?/arms?/leaves? that they no longer hold the discs at all -- if you're not careful when you open the cases, the discs go flying.

As long as the playing quality is okay (and I assume it won't, now that I know to be careful when opening) that won't bother me overmuch; it was a very good price for a six-disc set. But if you were thinking of giving it for a gift, be aware that if the copy you receive is like the one I did, it won't have the appearance of a new item.

As for the series itself, I liked it a lot when it was on the air and was sad when it wasn't picked up.",1402012800,,1223,4.236051502145923

It's also good as a reminder of the near insanity that overtook the US in the wake of the Iraq War, and speaks with prescience about the Left/Right schism that divides it now. And all of this mingled into a frantic, seat of the pants ride through the 'show must go on' ethos of Live weekly TV - as it might have been rendered by Classic Hollywood Master Director - Howard Hawks. I loved the feeling of being on the inside of the Kitchen as they cooked up the comedy in the writer's room and the authentic feel of Hollywood politics. I found it enjoyable and engrossing, and was particularly riveted by the last three episodes which kept me coming back, despite it's near soap opera crises and Happy Hollywood Ending. The older I get, the more I love the whole idea of 'happy endings' - and this one did the trick. It has really enjoyable acting, fantastically  skillful writing, memorable characters, great 'Hawksian' dialogue' delivered at a clip and some nicely surprising plots -- but somehow, for me, it still just misses the mark. I'd give it an 'A+' for effort and intention, but in the end it falls into my 'really good but not great' pile - and still don't quite know why.

And despite pleas to the contrary, the network decided it would not continue the show, opting instead for yet another idiot reality show.  'Studio 60' was one of those rare shows that, like 'West Wing', could have been television greatness.  It took 'West Wing' a season and a half to catch on; the pinhead execs at NBC could not see the same happening for 'Studio 60' because it was showing them -- the execs -- to be who they were in real life.

Also, I think if Peet hadn't become pregnant and forced the storyline to veer then the writing wouldn't have felt a little forced at that point.  And that three-story arc with the kidnapped brother was a bit much.  What can I say, Sorkin likes long kidnapping arcs -- look at West Wing.

Bradly Whitford continues his West Wing charm. And DL Hughley and Columbus Short prove just how difficult it is to be a POC on tv. (My only complaint?

I love Matthew Perry and I loved Bradley Whitford in The West Wing. I also loved The West Wing. I feel that we were forced into some of the character's personal lives before we could get to know them. They should have shown us more about the inner workings of sketch comedy television before introducing us to them. Cheesy love stories spring out of nowhere with this regurgitated dialogue that makes you cringe. Poor Matthew Perry. He's a great actor and I loved him in Friends but he gets put in lousy shows like this one. For some reason this was put on the same network at the same time as 30 Rock, a show about the exact same thing. Obviously one of them faired better.

Very talented actors, great writing.  I'm not all the way through the season yet and I can't figure out why it wasn't picked up for another season.
Matthew has so much talent I've never understood why that hasn't been recognized. This was a great vehicle for him. Maybe this came too quickly after Friends and West Wing that the views couldn't handle the new characters.....I  LOVE them!",1394064000,,553,4.612244897959184

If you give this show time the last five episodes will persuade you of his skill.  He sticks to his West Wing themes here but the show is heavily about the political divide in America between Christians and the Liberals who mock them (i. e. the SNL type comedy show that is the back drop for all the action). He wants to find common ground and he gets there, finally, in the traumas of the last several episodes.

Plus the principal actors are very good here and very good together, especially Matthew Perry, Steven Weber and Timothy Busfield. Weber was a real surprise for me having only known him from Wings.

Give it a chance. Get mad at much of what his characters are saying, but watch them trying to work out the ways they can say things together to each other, all friends, to find a truth that will cohere.",1393632000,,912,4.384615384615385

I could care less about NBS and if the ratings fall for Studio 60. I think it only got one season because a lot of people felt the way I do. It looks and feels like West Wing but it's not. It makes me think I'm watching something awesome and then it pulls this boring conversation about the networks and censoring. The characters are great and the stories between them are good but I still feel like it's trying to be West Wing with everything else.

1572281,5,B00005JPI6,I love this show.  To bad it's not on anymore.  Matthew Perry did a great job!  I would recommend this to anyone.,1392422400,,113,4.045454545454546
1572282,4,B00005JPI6,It was a very fast paced good program.  I enjoyed the story line and the cast was great.  I wasn't ready for it to end after one season.,1392422400,,136,3.8214285714285716
1572370,3,B00005JPI6,The first couple of episodes were fun but then the plot changed to include more drama among cast members and the network.  I looked ahead to the remaining episodes and this trend continued and increased.  I guess this explains why the show did not last long on network TV.  I have witnessed this before on show and in movies.  The plots starts good and then for some reason (executive interference) the plot has to include high school drama.,1392422400,,441,4.615384615384615
1572371,5,B00005JPI6,"It was only on for 1 season but it was gold. If you liked Matthew Perry on Friends (Chandler Bing) and you liked Bradley Whitford on The West Wing (Josh Lyman), and you like SNL, you will love this.

1572377,5,B00005JPI6,Watch it from start to finish about every year or so... Sorkin is a man who can not possibly work enough for my taste... The same can be said for much of this cast...,1392163200,,166,3.911764705882353
1572378,5,B00005JPI6,"I purchased Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip because I really enjoy Arrron Sorkin. He did not disappoint! I also just love Matthew Perry, Bradley Whitford and Amanda Peet...they do not disappoint! But after watching the first episode, I was already filled with a sad feeling...knowing there was only one season to watch! The characters are easy to love (or hate), and the writing is so crisp. It is a show within a show, I was amazed with all the sketches and the fact that they were just a backdrop for the show! You have to love Harriet and the chemistry she has with everyone but especially with Mathew Perry's character.
There is a certain quality in each and every series that Arron Sorkin creates. I look forward to the two seasons of Sports Night, and lovingly anticipate the return of The Newsroom!",1392163200,,803,4.6223776223776225

1572460,5,B00005JPI6,I remember when this series started that I was impressed by the quality of the writing on this show and excellent acting by the cast.  It was a fresh premise for a TV show and unlike anything I had seen before or since.  It was too bad that the network didn't give it more time to get an audience because the characters were interesting and likeable. The casting was spot on and the actors meshed well together.  I still enjoy going back to watch it even now.,1391990400,,459,4.252873563218391

1572465,5,B00005JPI6,Such a good show. Too bad people would rather watch trash on tv than see something that is well written like this. It had a great storyline and a really great direction right up to the point it was canceled.,1391904000,,207,4.2
1572466,5,B00005JPI6,"Very clever and entertaining. Good characterizations, great acting, interesting situations. The episodes 'Nevada Day' part 1 & 2 were terrific.
Likening Studio 60 to 30 Rock isn't possible. Yes, they are both about behind the scenes of a tv comedy show but there the similarity ends. It would be like comparing Seinfeld to Friends... Yes they were both sitcoms about a group of pals, but Seinfeld was so much more. IMHO obviously.",1391904000,,430,4.986111111111111
1572467,5,B00005JPI6,I loved this show when it was first on TV in 2006/2007.  Recently re-watched all episodes. Really good mix of drama with some comedy. The smart dialogue and on-set movement (I.e. Walking and talking) remind me a lot of the show The West Wing. ( also Aaron Sorkin) Thought the cast was super!  Just wish there were additional seasons to watch!!!,1391904000,,344,4.622950819672131

Well, I am staying on the treadmill longer because I can't bear to pause the show.  The cast is so incredible and the writing so smart.  And, I'm burning calories!",1391731200,,326,3.9692307692307693
1572548,4,B00005JPI6,"...I was very sad when NBC cancelled it. I recently re-watched all 22 episodes, and found the majority of them still likeable. It is Aaron Sorkin, so there's plenty of soliloquies regarding censorship, fundementalists, conservatives, et al, but the characters are likeable and the jokes are good. The casting was also fairly inspired, and I'm sorry I don't see D.L Hughely more these days.",1391644800,,389,5.09375

1572553,4,B00005JPI6,"This series started out great, but dimmed a little at the end as per usual with Sorkin. The last few episodes especially seemed rushed and the plot got too fairytale-esque for me. Overall, it was a decent series and something to watch when you don't know what else to see",1391385600,,271,4.44

1572668,5,B00005JPI6,....I'm at a genuine loss that such a superb series was discontinued...obviously the CEO's of television have no feel for the craft.  This show works a every level....makes the concept of television authentic entertainment.....yet now it is just another vanishing act!!  America is sinking into P&L Hell...!!!  The networks ....DON'T work.....!!!  Once again an invested audience is left with symptoms of withdrawal...!!!  I must say if the last episode was a known finale.....that I appreciated that none of the fantastic actors were mortally sacrificed...!!!  This show raised the bar for viewers....genuinely a tough act to follow!!,1391212800,,635,5.5625

I cannot believe that this show was cancelled when there's so much garbage programming that makes it...  I mean - the Kardashians are still on the air but an intelligent drama/comedy like this isn't???  En serio... Gente, que nos pasa?  No tiene sentido!  Que verguenza.  (This insanity just makes me want to rant in Spanish).  I just watched it on my Kindle with Amazon Prime but I'm buying the season because it's that good.",1390953600,,541,4.680851063829787

1572757,4,B00005JPI6,"Studio 60 started strong, up to what I normally expect from Aaron Sorkin.  In my opinion, the plot lines and interpersonal relationships moved to fast and got to complex.  It was hard to believe that the Jordan McDeere (sp?) character would have not terminated the pregnancy given her profile of an atheistic, high powered, fast rising exec and not married to or even in a relationship with the father.  I would have liked for the show to go multiple seasons, but enjoyed the 20+ episodes.  I will watch virtually anything from Aaron Sorkin (American President, West Wing, My Favorite Year, etc.) and Studio 60 did not disappoint me.",1390867200,,633,4.833333333333333

I really appreciated the honest look at how Hollywood views Christianity as two of the main characters struggled with her ""religion"" vs his belief system.  The focus wasn't on Christianity - it's about the production of a weekly LIVE show ala' Saturday night live. The behind the scenes story showed what goes into creating a weekly live broadcast and the real life challenges, successes and joy of the the people behind the stories, the challenges they face, the calm under pressure demeanor and the intricately interwoven lives of the people behind the characters they play on TV.

Its really a shame they only made one season as it couldhave been a big hit, honestly I never heard of it when it was released but found it on here and think lack of promoting and possibly airing at wrong times or on wrong network may be why it didn't last as if I had known about it I would have watched it.

I just can't understand why Studio 60 was cancelled after one season.  I've heard production cost was a factor, and so were ratings.

Both shows are different, 30 Rock goes for the quick laugh while Studio 60 is more of a drama with very funny lines and story lines.
I never was able to see every episode during its first and only season. I did watch every show and there are stories that run the entire season. There us no cliff hanger for the nonexistent season 2, so you won't be disappointed watching.
Maybe it showed to much of the behind the scenes that the network didn't like it and pulled the plug.

1572970,4,B00005JPI6,"I haven't watched anything from Aaron Sorkin that I didn't like. Now it makes me wonder if it's because I agree with his politics or if it's because he has influenced my political views.
Like all his classic hits, American President, The West Wing, The Newsroom he manages to make a political statement carefully weaving it into the story.
The same is true with Studio 60, although I'm not sure the world was ready for it at the time. That may explain its short life. I enjoyed watching the program back when it was originally on and its been a nostalgic look back at the events occurring at the time. One thing for sure, whoever does casting for Aaron Sorkin can't be beat. He's able to attract some of the best talent and even though  it's just a TV show we're treated to performances worthy of Oscar.",1389657600,,803,4.462585034013605

We've watched all of this show, twice now, although it was cut short largely due to the writer's strike...we're currently on our second run through of West Wing, and are anxiously awaiting the third season of Newsroom.  Aaron's writing is sharp, witty, funny and thought provoking. All of his shows move at a quick pace, which we enjoy, and I love the subtle (sometimes not so subtle) ways he hints to his other works.",1389139200,,460,4.666666666666667

I enjoyed the chemistry between Matt (Matthew Perry) and Danny (Bradley Whirford), and found their flawed characters highly likeable. I assume that the neat ending of the final episode came about because the producers knew the show was ending... maybe it was too neatly tied up for some, but I like a bit of closure.

If you enjoy the pace of a Sorkin vehicle- that is to say intelligent, snappy banter that can make your head spin, coupled with likeable, honorable, flawed and surprising characters, you must watch this series!",1389052800,,698,4.816666666666666

1573193,5,B00005JPI6,"My only 2 problems with this series were 1) it was canceled way too soon, and 2) the streaming by Amazon is annoying:  it catches, sometimes once or twice a sentence, for several minutes, or the video will freeze while the audio continues.  I've tried emptying the cache and this does nothing.  This is an Amazon problem that I've encountered on several of their instant videos, so it's not a problem with this series, but it's particularly annoying as this series showcases Aaron Sorkin at his word-drunk best.  I think the reason this series, which Mr. Sorkin created after the West Wing, didn't catch on was that, compared to the sweeping issues raised by a show set in the White House, the problems of a group of comics putting on a sketch comedy show didn't have the same sense of urgency.  Watching it again, though, I'm really impressed both by the casting and the acting choices--Ed Asner has a very assured turn as an urbane media mogul, whose multiple companies INCLUDE a network; Steven Webber really struck me as the head of the network--he doesn't try to make his character likable at all, so when the plot shows him to have his own sense of integrity and commitment to both the people working for him and those he works for, it's completely disarming. Finally, Mark McKinney, of Kids in the Hall fame, who also served this series as Story Editor and wrote 3 episodes, really startled me in a three episode arc as a comedy writer with a personal tragedy in his background-- an almost affect-less performance of a good guy who's emotionally burned out.  Nothing from KITH prepares you for this beautiful pencil sketch of a role.  I could go on about the leads, but then I'd just be gushing.  The major star of the show is Sorkin's writing:  Sure, everybody sounds like they went to the same ivy league school, but what dialogue!",1388966400,,1840,4.636923076923077

1573567,5,B00005JPI6,Great show.  Unfortunately the writing was too smart for the masses so it only lasted one season.  Episodes 1 through 10 were perfect.  At that point (I'm guessing) they were told they wouldn't be picked up for a second season and they spent the remaining episodes trying to cram in 3 seasons worth of story lines.,1387497600,,314,4.571428571428571

1573571,4,B00005JPI6,"Network TV's short attention span never allowed this show to generate an audience. Aaron  Sorkin's first show after the West Wing deserved more time to find its legs.

1573627,3,B00005JPI6,"Every positive comment about the smart witty writing is right on and as a huge fan of West Wing and Sports Night I appreciate Aaron Sorkin's writing.  That said, his writing here reflects an animosity toward Christianity that comes through in practically every episode.  He uses this platform to advance his beliefs on gay life/gay marriage and effectively insults anyone who has a different idea.  With such a singular focus it's no wonder that this show lasted only one season. In this show Mr. Sorkin writes over and over  that broadcast TV needs more courage but in the process becomes so preachy that he loses the fundamental idea that it must also be entertaining and interesting.",1386720000,,686,4.887931034482759
1573628,5,B00005JPI6,"Studio 60 choose the wrong season. It went against another freshman show (can you believe?) on the same network NBC -- 30 Rock.  I believe we all know the outcome.

The biggest problem was that they were two completely different shows with the same premise. 30 Rock was an out and out comedy while Studio 60 was a mix-up/sometimes funny sitcom. The general taste of the moment was for comedy so Studio 60 got confused by the public and lost out.

This is a real quality show. The cast is dynamite. The stories are witty, wry and wonderful. They remained dead-on and this should have worked for it's own 20 year run. The producers tried everything to keep it going to even cutting cost by filming in 16mm while keeping production values and guest slots high. No matter, this was still an expensive show and the ratings were taking a hit from the confusion.

Matthew Perry carries the show effortlessly. Bradley Whitford is the perfect producer/friend/mentor. Amanda Peet is just superb as a constantly challenged but gutsy and game new network boss with her own ideas while Stephen Weber is the perfect foil as network chairman. Add a cast of winners: Timothy Busfield as the director who also did actually direct a number of episodes, Sarah Paulson as the quirky and yet centered central talent of the late-nite show, D. L. Hughley and Nate Corddry and the occasional appearance of Ed Asner as well as a deep list of supporting players and guest stars make this simply a delight to watch.",1386374400,,1488,4.689655172413793

1573632,5,B00005JPI6,"Extraordinarily underrated, Aaron Sorkin is as great as ever.  The show is witty, fast paced, and reliably funny.  The main criticisms you'll read are about the un-realism of the plot.... as thought most of TV is otherwise completely realistic and viable!

People forget that like good literature, a television show can be a narrative plot device, a forum for telling jokes, making a political point, or just exhibiting great characters.  Studio 60 does all of that and more!

You'll laugh, you'll tear up, and you'll end up wishing this show had gone on for another season or two or three.",1385942400,,590,4.86

It captures the feeling of the American political climate in the 2000s in a smart and personal way. And I forgot how many great actors were in this show!

1573675,3,B00005JPI6,"Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet and Steven Weber were extraordinary. There were two big problems. The writing was so hot and cold that it made the show a target. The biggest issue was Sarah Paulson. I'm sure she is talented, but they needed someone with so much charisma in that role. I never believed she was funny, I never believed her Christianity, and I just became aware of a gaping hole whenever she was on the screen.

I put on the first episode just curious what it was about since Matthew Perry starred in it, and by the end of the season (which I got through in only about 3 days) I was telling my friends all about the show and lamenting NBC's choice to pit it directly against 30 Rock.

1573745,5,B00005JPI6,"As in The West Wing, Sorkin creates a high-pressure world inhabited by tangible, textured, interesting people who are believably flawed and believably gifted. The conflicts between them are often set between inspired idealism and a brutal practicality born of sometimes bitter experience and the battles are passionately, and above all, intelligently fought. And when Sorkin brings these two points of view together, when the ball-busting SOB you hated all season comes around, finds his way to a practical and inspired idealism, grabs the flag and carries it on to the ramparts.... it never fails to choke me up.",1384214400,,613,5.26530612244898
1573746,5,B00005JPI6,"I devoured this series on Netflix and fell in love with the main characters (Matthew Perry pulled me in as a former Friends addict, and Bradley Whitford was outstanding as his best friend).  As the show went along, I just couldn't help but becoming invested in these characters.  It wasn't until a year or two later that I learned that this was a show by the guy who did The West Wing, which I had never watched but which my wife swore by.  So I bought the West Wing boxed set, devoured that, and bought whatever other Sorkin shows I could get my hands on, including this set on DVD.  My wife hadn't seen it, so I told her she should check it out.  After the first two episodes, she wasn't super-into it; after the first four episodes, she couldn't turn it off; and she was with me after the final episode in thinking that this was a show that was cancelled too soon.  I had never seen D.L. Hughley in such a dynamic role before, and I have to say, I was impressed.  Ditto for Amanda Peet, Sarah Paulson, and pretty much everyone in the cast.  Definitely worth you time if you like to see good people interact in complex moral situations.

1573748,5,B00005JPI6,"It tries to open up what I feel are important issues on television and its roll in society, including a sub-discussion of how divided America is and making some attempt at bringing the two sides together. As others have stated, in can be heavy handed and condescending, and it also suffered from trying to include 4 years of material into a single season. They knew about halfway through production that they would only have one season, and so Sorkin tried to wrap up the series by the end of the season (and largely succeeded).

You can tell there was more in the future for these characters but things had to be wrapped up quickly when NBC didn't pick up the series for a second season. It is the type of show that you can completely lose yourself in- all of the sudden you're 5 episodes in and completely hooked! The Christmas episode has some of the most beautiful scenes in it.

1574066,4,B00005JPI6,"Not Sorkin's best, but definitely not his worst, Studio 60 was a victim of 2 things: unfortunate timing and not being ""haha"" funny.  With 30 Rock out the same year, it drew comparisons to that great sitcom (unfairly or not).  And unlike SportsNite, Sorkin needed to write actual comedy sketches that went beyond the humor of his dialogue (which he excels at).

He failed.

The sketches that turn the fake Studio 60 back into a cultural powerhouse never quite work.  The cast that could do impressions weren't really doing topical ones (it's a great Juliette Lewis impression, but how relevant was she in 2006, let alone now?).

The scene stealer turned out to be Steven Weber as the network chairman.  He's the only one who seems good at his job.

Overall, I enjoy Studio 60 (this is my third time watching it), and it ends after one season on a fairly satisfying note, which helps make it worth the time.

The characters are well portrayed and very funny.  The cast is excellent at playing off each other.  So sad this show ended.  Should have gone on for at least a decade.  The season finale is actually the last 4 episodes, so it just continues to build and then they fix everything neatly in the very last one.  But the show inside the show is meant to continue indefinitely so I was saddened that I couldn't have that peek any more.  I loved all the drama and comedy.

Matthew Perry, DL Hughley, Sarah Paulson, Amanda Peet are just fabulous as is the supporting cast.

The series was great for the first third of the episodes, then lost steam, whether that was when the plug was pulled or not... who knows....

I am not a fan of the Newsroom, there are no characters I like, or can identify with...

Sports Night was more upbeat and it was nice that Malina's character ""gets the girl"" it may not be fair but everything  Sorkin does will be compared to the West Wing which I usually in my head think of as the real WW or the sub par second half WW with the Smitts and Alda story arc

I can tolerate the  Sorkin rants which are in all the shows, but for me whichever of his shows that  I am watching
there has to be a balance of humor/entertainment to rant ratio and this show had it for about half its run

for a series with only 22 episodes there were a few classic bits:

Allison Janney's episode
scenes with Timothy Busfield

1574459,4,B00005JPI6,"I had heard good things about this show, and generally like Aaron Sorkin's style of writing, so I decided to give it a try. The plot and acting were much more engaging than I expected. The control room antics and in-show production issues were pretty exciting.

But...
Midway through the season, the plot focus seemed to change from producing the comedy to the character interactions and plights. The romance and drama between Harriet and Matt sort of took over the show, paralleling what happens in the plot. It was still fun to watch, but felt drawn out. The last episode was very different from the feel of the pilot - I prefer a show that comes full circle in the first season, perhaps drawing on some inside jokes and fully engaging the audience. If it wasn't for the great acting, I probably wouldn't have watched the whole first season.",1375056000,,843,4.657718120805369

This comes from someone that is a polar opposite from Sorkin in political views (he is left while I am right) which is apparent in all of his shows (West Wing, Sports Night, Studio 60, and The Newsroom), however, that does not stop me from enjoying his writing nor the excellent acting that is in this show",1372982400,,514,4.711111111111111

I also like the fact that DL Hugley is able to be in a less comedic role and still be great as an actor.  Overall, the show is good and I'd recommend it.",1372982400,,446,4.0227272727272725
1574721,4,B00005JPI6,"First off, perspective, I'm a died in the wool cord cutter.

Not desperate to find material to watch, but anytime I can get a major ""chunk o time"" to watch something without putting a lot of thought into it.  (bad thing about cable cutting, you're stuck being your own ""video jockey"", so a good series is a good thing.).

That said, this was apparently put together by Aaron Sorkin (American President, West Wing, Newsroom (ongoing series, well worth watching).  Like Kevin Smith, it would seem there's a cadre of actors that follow along for a lot of his efforts.  It helps that they are an enjoyable crew and can execute dialogue well.

In this case, think a backstage look at ""Saturday Night Live"", which they give a respectful to several times over the course of the series. Also, a nod given to the old movie ""Network"", which is used as another part of the basic premise.

Premise?  Well, for reasons that would act as a spoiler, Matt and Danny, walk off / get fired from a Saturday Night Live type show.  Years later, it's falling apart and Judd Hirsch as Wes gets ""Mad as h*ll and won't take it anymore"", from there Matt and Danny come on board to try and right the sinking ship.

There are a lot of themes that are similar across all of Mr. Sorkin's offerings.

-  A small enclosed society, being assaulted by a highly sensitive outside world (one of the big plot things in all of these is characters doing something inappropriate and having to fight the battle on whether to apologize or not.).
-  Comedy, goodly amounts of that, a lot of it works (between the different cast members)
-  Ties into events of the world current to the show itself;  Iraq War, Flooding of New Orleans, kidnapped soldiers.  They work, but I can see an issue with this whole thing down the road.  Who's going to remember the tie-in?  The cast, nod accordingly, and the writers for the most part assume that the viewer is going to figure it out.
-  Uses industry insider knowledge, terms, processes, things that people as part of the show know what is going on, in many cases it isn't explained to the viewer (dropped .2 points for that)
-  Comedy, bearable amounts, that don't really work all that well (thus the dropping of .5 stars), which is the actual comedy routines of the show itself.
-  All of the characters are damaged goods, and a few of them have alcohol and drug issues.  (works pretty well)
-  Character relationships, A man driven by his love for a woman to succeed, but so confused by her that one day they're together and the next not? (how unrealistic is that (sarcasm))

Final .3 points deduction, the main female lead is a devout Christian, but tolerates all sorts of sniping at her religious beliefs in skits and such.  Matt, one of the main male leads, doesn't ""get"" the whole faith thing, their interaction detracts from the overall flow of the series.  BUT, is extremely critical to the plot progression.

One thing I have heard is that the humor is extremely sharp, snide and critical...

Well, that is true for some of the characters, but really that's a starting place, as the series progresses and you get under the skin of the characters and what drives them and how they develop, it seems to me that they mellow out fairly well.

Of course, I have been criticized for being overly cynical and sarcastic, so there's that.

End of the day, it's a complete package including an almost satisfying ending.  To me extremely watchable / rewatchable.

If you've seen West Wing, you'll see a couple of episodes that are like ""I'll take that idea and respin it for TV"", but they work.

Highly recommended and if you get a chance check out Newsroom, another good series.",1372982400,,3676,4.563358778625954

1574725,4,B00005JPI6,"The 60-30 War (Studio 60 vs 30 Rock) marked the beginning of a decline into goofy comedy's dominance in everything we see now. More and more shows follow the Emmy - winning shows formula and thus we have what we have. However, Studio 60 fought a different way.

Bringing his award-winning writing skills to comedy, Aaron Sorkin wrote dramatic stories that put the characters in awkward situations time and time again to show the stresses of trying to always be funny. We see pregnancy, death, anger, racism, sexism, religious differences, and more throughout the season.

No show is perfect. Sorkin's narrow interpretation of religion (Christians specifically) grows tiresome, but that does not take away from the strength of his writing and provides an interesting view of the characters.

I recently ran through this season on AzPrime and was reminded how wonderful this show was.  It gave us a glimpse into a world most will never see or understand.  Whats better, they found a way to intertwine drama and comedy without being goofy.  The show, at its core, was a Drama.  They interject comedy not with slapstick stupidity (by now you know what I mean), but instead through the fictional variety show itself, allowing them to have comedy not interfere with the world we were drawn into.

The writing was fresh.  The cast, a perfect group (everyone fit together).  The production itself showed just the right amount of live show running that we felt privileged to peek behind the curtain, but not so much that we got distracted by it.

This show could easily be brought back today, picking up where it left off, and would be instantly embraced, especially without a low-brow slapstick comedy drawing attention away this time.  Hey, Arrested Development made a comeback, lets do it for S-60.

Second, they only offered standard $3,99 shipping, but the item shipped so quickly it was as good as if I'd paid extra for 2 or 3 day shipping.

Finally, despite the fact I was told from the beginning that no tracking was available the seller was available for contact and quickly responded to all the emails I sent.

I couldn't have been happier or more impressed with the speed of shipping and quality of the product once if was delivered. The seller exceeded expectation and was helpful through every step even when I was just being annoying and continuously checking the status of my order and/or delivery.

The show itself is good, I bought it without ever seeing an episode solely because it is an Aaron Sorkin show, but the real story here is how awesome the seller was so 5 Stars in every category that affects the seller: ""sallys-books-place.""  That seller had a 97% positive review when I ordered from them, but as far as I can tell they deserve a 100% positive seller review, for... as I stated earlier, going above and beyond what they needed to do to answer and acknowledge any and/or all of my obsessive questions. I guarantee I was being annoying, but the seller never acted as if they were annoyed and took the time to answer all my questions and/or concerns. Even the ones I'm sure they had to do some research work to find the answer, not just answering the simple questions that required minimal effort.  That is the true sign of a good-seller, that cares about each of their customers even the ones that are ordering 1 small, used inexpensive DVD box set. Again, 5 Stars and above for every category involving the seller and their customer service and fulfilling orders with the quality description matching what they write: ""sallys-books-place"" trustworthy and worth giving your business. Fair pricing, great quality, and extremely quick shipping- quicker than they told me it would be so once again, I repeat myself with positive information for ""sallys-books-place"" a top-notch seller!!",1370390400,,2192,4.755263157894737

That year, there were two shows that featured an SNL-type program, and Studio 60 was compared unfavorably to 30 Rock and suffered in the ratings.  If CBS had as much character as their series, they would have given it at least another year to develop its audience.  As it is, you'll look at this ""failed"" series and weep for the future.

Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford as the producer and director of the late night show have a chemistry that is rare.  Add Amanda Peet as their ballsy network head, and Sarah Paulson as the alluring Christian comedy star (inspired by Kristin Chenoweth, it is known) and you have the best foursome on television since the Carol Burnett Show.

This focused far too much on the characters personal lives and not the main plot of the show.  I would not recommend this show.

1575512,4,B00005JPI6,"Great comedy drama from writer Aaron Sorkin. Definitely worth checking out.  This show provides a fictional ""Behind the scenes"" look at how an SNL type comedy show is produced on a weekly basis.",1366588800,,194,4.878787878787879
1575513,5,B00005JPI6,Funny. Touching.  Intriguing.  Did I say funny?  One of the funniest tv episodes ever is the two-parter with John Goodman as a small town Nevada judge.,1366588800,,151,4.730769230769231
1575514,3,B00005JPI6,"I don't know if I should rate this a 2 stars or a 3 stars.  Maybe there should be something in between.  I'm a West Wing fan and it seems that Sorkin recycles plots and relationships and without a care. It's nice to see that he is loyal to his actors.  As loyal as he is to his actors he's equally loyal to his plots and blocking.  Frantic walks down hallways and swollen pregnant (literally and figuratively) relationships are resurrected.  I'm wondering how much time he spent at SNL doing his research?  Evidently not as much time as he spent researching West Wing or A Few Good Men.  It seems his best work is writing for film.  I'm a fan of Sorkin don't get me wrong; a loyal fan.  His new series for HBO is interesting but it leaves me unsatisfied in some scenes and I can't take the hyper screaming from the lead actors.  As always there is a sexual tension between the main characters and while I'm drawn in by the comic irony I think it might be nice if Sorkin let some of his writing staff take a stab at a new plot twist.

But then would it be the Sorkin drama for which we tuned in?  The West Wing changed in the final years.  Because Sorkin built such a strong foundation and strong characters the replacement writers only had to fill in the blanks--like a coloring book.  Where Sorkin may fall short in his limited plot twists he can create characters that don't bleed into each other.  That is a feat in and of itself.  He is not afraid of big casts.  He can keep the traffic flowing smoothly and that's not easy.  You become emotionally connected with his characters in the same way Shakespeare locked in his audience.

The most amazing thing about Sorkin's writing is that he doesn't talk down to his audience--he demands that maybe sometimes you reach for your dictionary or go to the library and read a book or venture out and see a play--familiarize yourself with the elite clothing designers and jewelers. He's totally well rounded and his work makes me feel like I could possibly be sophisticated one day or at least I'll know what the upper-classes hold in high esteem like SAT scores well after they are 50 years old.  Who knew?

All that said, Sorkin rules!  You may enjoy the series for the comedy but you will come back for the sexual tension.",1366502400,,2270,4.40625

1576031,4,B00005JPI6,"Just finished watching the first (and only) season of Studio 60. I enjoyed it for the same reasons I enjoyed Schlamme and Sorkin's project immediately prior, The West Wing. The writing is snappy and charged (does anyone talk like this in real life? I wish) as many Sorkin scripts are, and there are the familiar walk-and-talks. Combine this writing with actors who can pull it off (I thought Steven Weber was particularly good in his role as network president Jack Rudolph) and you've got a compelling drama. Unfortunately, many of the West Wing's story lines were also adopted. For example, the romantic tension between characters Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) echoed the romantic tension between Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford) and Donna Moss (Janel Moloney) from the West Wing. Even some of the characters were co-opted from TWW, such as Whitford and Timothy Busfield (even Matthew Perry had a guest appearance on TWW), although I enjoy these actors work so much that this is less of a complaint and more of a praise. Sorkin has a habit of re-using actors in his projects, but because these actors are usually good at what they do, I don't mind. In addition to borrowed actors and borrowed story lines, the writing also contained the similar liberal-edged agenda, which worked on a show focusing on a Democratic president but feels a little more propaganda-ish when removed from that political realm.

In the end, it's not hard to see why Studio 60 wasn't successful with audiences. Between the unfortunate timing of coming on the air about the same time as 30 Rock (which created some confusion for viewers, I imagine, when two shows based on the inner workings of comedy shows had such different approaches) and relying on the same tactics that made The West Wing successful (but TWW had also just finished a strong albeit diminishing run), Studio 60 probably struggled to maintain an audience. However, it's those same reasons that make me wish the show would somehow magically start running again. After all, 30 Rock is now off the air and, in my humble opinion, The West Wing has aged quite well.",1363219200,,2133,4.892265193370166

I love Aaron Sorkin's clever, fast-paced writing -- especially his snappy dialogue -- but romantic relationships on all of his shows always strike me as immature; the characters act like love-sick middle-schoolers and not like adults. The plots become more contrived as the season goes on, as Sorkin and his writers pile on complications to keep the wheels spinning.

The show was cancelled after one season of life imitating art, and so on.  Nothing new there.

I missed most of this show the first time around.  Did they keep moving the night?  There's always enough in an Alan Sorkin show to keep my attention and respect for the effort.

This horse is dead by the first episode and beaten over and over for the rest of the series. The best part of the series comes when John Goodman shows up as a back country judge and spends the majority of the show shutting everyone up and telling them how unfunny they really are, which is a sad thing for a show supposed,y about a variety show and comedy writers and comedians.

Imagine 30 Rock that isn't funny. That's this show. It's an intense drama about comedians which makes the tone and pace way off. I went from watching The West Wing to this, hoping it would follow suit. Not so much. Interesting, but not good.",1360454400,,765,4.464285714285714

It has enormous strengths, a great cast, wonderful dialogue (as always, with Sorkin), interesting twists and turns.  It was one of my favorite shows of 2006 (it WAS 2006, wasn't it), easily.  I have since watched it through two more times, and each time, found it fun, engaging, smart, and completely worth the time.  And THIS is the show that got cancelled?  Really?  Do I need to create a laundry list of the rotten shows that have survived for years on network television?  Do I need to mention Friends?  Has Anyone LOOKED at what's on TV today?  How could THIS show get canned?  You can see towards the end of the series that Sorkin and his writers were scrambling a bit to resolve story lines they had assumed (hoped) would extend for seasons to come.  Some of the endings feel a bit too easy, but I can't see how that could have been avoided under the circumstances. Yes, some of the SNL-type skits seem a bit flat, but then, has anyone watched SNL over the past 20 years? As a wise old comic once said, they can't all be diamonds.

Studio 60 is a very entertaining, well-acted show, and I recommend it highly.  (Yes, I recommend West Wing more highly, as I do think it's the single greatest achievement in network TV history.)",1357862400,,1311,4.504237288135593

The beauty of West Wing was the moderate development of each character over the seasons.  This show struck me as trying to be too big, too fast.

That being said, I feel that there was a lot of good writing and a lot of good acting within a large ensemble cast.  While I don't think that it was ever as good as the West Wing, I feel that it is an enjoyable show with a lot to offer.",1348876800,,555,3.919642857142857

Yes, the show is not perfect, and I'm not sure how long something devoted to the intricacies of television could run, but I tend to talk about this show the way people talk about those perfect British series' that run for 12 episodes and are out.  Most of the shows that made it past 7 or 8 years (let alone 4 or 5), had fewer and fewer high water marks.

1576458,4,B00005JPI6,"I love Aaron Sorkin's writing. ""Sports Night"", ""The West Wing"", and ""Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip"" are among my favorite TV shows of all time, with ""The West Wing"" firmly ensconsed in the top slot. When I got my Roku box ""Studio 60"" was the very first show I started watching and didn't stop until I'd seen all the episodes again. Crisp, human, dramatic, funny, with characters you care about deeply. What more can you ask for? Even with its flaws, this is great television; among the best to appear on broadcast.

Flaws? Yes. Even a rapid fan such as I have to admit that the show got a little preachy and some of the directorial/scripting tricks were a little stale and overused. (Walking and talking, I'm looking at you!) It won't wear as well as Sorkin's other two outings because it really needs the context of post-911, wars on two fronts in the news every day, and ""if you're not with us you're against us"" to be understood viscerally. It has the same problem movies about McCarthyism or the blacklist have: people have moved on and don't remember the popular sentiments of the day.

The evils ""Studio 60"" rails against, the phony patriotism to foster commercial aims, the pandering, the lost of critical thinking and public debate, are out of context less than a decade later. Sorkin, and his co-conspirator Thomas Schlamme, tried to bring us the sense of the time and the arguments that did not get heard much when this was all unfolding. It's important we remember these things. The tapering ratings while it aired showed many just didn't find the weekly exposition as entertaining as ""Dancing with the Stars"" or ""American Idol"". It required too much thought, I guess. I lovde it and wished there were more on the air just like it.",1337990400,,1742,4.652597402597403
1576459,5,B00005JPI6,"From the same folks that brought us The West Wing, I love this show. It has the shooting and writing signatures of West Wing in that it clips along and is filled with the ""Walk and Talk"" staging of their other works. The acting and story are amazingly clever and thought-provoking. Another stellar series that was dropped all too soon. I would have thought that a show based on Saturday Night Live would have had a more mass appeal. Ah, Well....",1335830400,,445,4.506172839506172
1576460,5,B00005JPI6,"""Studio 60 on the Sunset Stip"" made it's debut the same year as ""30 Rock""-appeared to be the same premise: behind the scenes of a long running comedy hit. Where 30 Rock is comedy all the way, Studio 60 is a drama-an Aaron Sorkin/Thomas Schlamme masterpiece. If you loved The"" West Wing"" and enjoy ""Saturday Night Live"" somewhere along the line, then I have no doubt that you will appreciate the brillance of Studio 60. I love how each episode unfolds and as with The West Wing I suggest that you watch the episodes in air date sequence. The cast is fantastic: Matthew Perry (""Friends"" doesn't show case his drauma chops) is wonderful and he and Bradley Whitford play brilliantly against each other's characters. I love the Sorkin/Schlamme character development. How can you miss? Amanda Peet, Steven Weber, D.L. Hughley, Timothy Busfield-if you enjoyed any of their work in television or film before or after the one season of Studio 60 you will appreciate this gem as well. Hardly a one hit wonder. If you are a Hawaii 5 O/Alex O'Loughlin fan check out ""Moonlight"" the precusor to all the vampire series so popular as of 2012. Moonlight had a 16 episode run after falling victim to the Writer's Strike that year and went on to win the People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drauma. ""Underworld"" fans will recognize Sophia Myles. Don't let a one season run scare you off. I watch both Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Moonlight once a year.

This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. How did this only have one season? I think the network gave up too easily. They did not realize that they had the next hit show right in their hands. This could have gone 10 or more seasons. The writing is cleaver, the acting is excellent, the timing is superb, and the ensemble cast is perfect. I am sooooo disappointed that I cannot continue watching. It makes me angry to see all the junk shows that are on the air season after season knowing that this quality show was cancelled. It seems as though it must have been cancelled for personal reasons.",1333324800,,679,4.44
1576514,5,B00005JPI6,"This creative gem from Aaron Sorkin has something in common with another, albeit completely different creative gem from another award winning writer, David Milch's ""John From Cincinnati"".  Both were scripted by writers with prior successes of major proportions:  Sorkin with ""The West Wing"", et al, and Milch with ""Deadwood"" ""NYPD Blue"", ""Hill Street Blues"", etc.  Tragically, both shows were canceled after just one season because their respective networks failed to support either show long enough for it to develop a solid audience.  Both shows had stellar casting, excellent writing from week to week and solid direction.  Commerce over art.  What a loss.

I watched ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" back when it was originally broadcast on network TV and thought it was everything one would want in a weekly series.  I was sorry to see it go.  I was recently drawn to watch it again after reading ""Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live as Told by its Stars, Writers, & Guests"".  I was captivated here by Sorkin's writing from the POV of an inside look at a weekly late night comedy sketch show, as well as the directing, sets, acting, dialog, pacing, & camera work - love the signature extended ""walk and talks"" throughout the series.  In addition, the casting of this show was sublime.  The chemistry between Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford is genuine and it's so much fun to watch them together.  You really believe there's a bond between these two guys that goes way beyond a working show business partnership.  After ""Friends"", Matthew Perry was never better than he is here.  Add in Steven Weber, Amanda Peet, Sarah Paulson (excellent on a couple of episodes of ""Deadwood"" by the way), Timothy Busfield (""Thirtysomething""), D.L. Hughley, Simon Helberg (""The Big Bang Theory""), John Goodman (""I don't roll on Shabbos!"")...what more could you want?  Weber, in particular, is a standout as a network executive.  His performance is electric.

The subject matter here is unique - not another overly simplistic police procedural or medical drama.  After reading ""Live From New York: An Uncensored History..."", I found Sorkin's writing about the inner workings of a late night sketch show to be spot on.  Something I didn't truly appreciate the first time around and in a completely different league than ""30 Rock"".  Tina Fey is great, but she's no Aaron Sorkin.

I agree with the other reviewers here.  This show is a lost gem.  Some of the references are a bit dated, but ignore those and watch this series.  If you like smart writing, great dialog, and enjoy watching a superb ensemble of actors doing what they do at their very best, you will not be disappointed.  Although, if you're like me, you'll be left wishing there was more than just this one season.",1331164800,,2794,4.916666666666667
1576515,5,B00005JPI6,"The first five minutes of the Pilot of Studio 60 on The Sunset Strip (Aaron Sorkin's brilliant and short lived television series after The West Wing)will explain beautifully why it is that this - the finest and most intelligent piece of television in history - lasted for only one season. Aaron Sorkin is a world class writer. In fact, not since William Shakespeare has a playwrite managed text as though each word were a notated piece of music. Sorkin has the respect of every executive, actor, crew member and writer in both Hollywood and New York, but the average television viewer is comfortably enteratined by ""Married With Children"" the formula crime shows of Dick Wolf and the formula direction of Jay Sandrich and Jim Burrows.

Studio 60 is a behind the scenes look at what happens on a weekly live comedy satire show. It's modeled after the classic ""Saturday Night Live"" and what we see on the scrfeen moves as fast as what happens in the studio. Backstage is like Boston's route 128 without road dividers and Thomas Schlamme, the director, knows how to film it, cameras moving as fast as toyotas, fvery few cuts, famous ""walk and Talks, where w2e feel as though we're wlking with them. The subject magtter is brilliant and it FEELS realistic- the truth- though who would know. Though the show is written like a symphony and is about a TV show what it's really abo0ut is people. Family.

And the pilot for this- as well as each subsequent episode, is clearly expensive, a remarkable set and the finest most reverred actors alive today. Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford are remarkable. We know him as Chandler, but tis is a different man entirely and Matthew Perry is a remarkable actor. Amanda Peet, as beautiful as can be imagined, is a class act, first rate actor. Th4e supporting cast is all remarkable and many of them you know (Simon Hedburg who does a remarkable Nicholas Cage, is now a household name as Howard Wolowitz on ""{The Big Bang Theory"".) In addition, on the first 45 minutes we have Steven Webber (who makes you forget his irresponsible jokester chanracter from ""Wings"" within ten seconds) Ed Asner, Fellicity Huffman, Donna Murphy and Judd Hirsch. The budget for actors salaries alone show that the network was well invested here. I suppose that it's much like the music publishers and recording executives who, back in the 1970's and 80's, lost money on the work of Stephen Sondheim because they knew that one day he'd be recognized and they'd more than make their money back. Soprkin';s work requires an audience who must think and listen; watch and connect. It's not the sort of television that one can miss half of and still be able to chat about it at work the next dayt.
like Sondheim, we'll all catch up. Now Sondheim is rehgarded as the finest composer alive and the all time best writer of musical theatre. I predicted that in 1979. Here's my prediction now: Aaron Sorkin is the next Shakespeare.

This is likely the case here. You won't find a better DVD set anywhere and given the brillliance, the comedy, the speed and the acting here, you won;t want to rent it because you can watch it over and over. (John Goodman does a remarkable two episoded arch as a Nevada Judge that is some of the best work ever seen on television)We learn, we love and we see another one of Sorkin's family shows. Mom and Dad are executive producers instead of a President and CHeif of Staff, but they're all here, there's love and support and every single episode is as impressive as a major motion picture written by Aaron Sorkin- Charlie Wilson's War, A Few Good Men, Social Network.

1576591,5,B00005JPI6,"I'm about halfway through watching these online, a little more.  This was one of those shows I started watching when it was airing, and then I inexplicably stopped, thinking ""I'll just catch up on these later on the DVR.."". This is what I usually do.  I rarely watch live TV.  I am so sorry I didn't keep up with as it aired.  What an amazing, smart, and funny dramedy. I don't have a Nielsen box in my house, so not sure if that would have done any good, but I surely would've written few angry letters when the death knells started to ring.

What drew me back to it was some curiosity as to why I don't see more of Matthew Perry around on my TV these days. He's obviously got far more depth and range than just the type of character that made him famous in Friends. So I re-discovered this gem. While he's enjoyed some success in films, he really proves what he's made of in this show.  Studio 60 wasn't given a chance.  I think a big issue was that it didn't grab enough people out of the gate.  This show needed a few episodes to get people on board and curious about what the next episode held, about where the characters were going.  It really was a ""long"" lead-in.  However, once in, it's extremely satisfying.

The show had gifted writers and directors, amazing acting talent...the lineup was just spectacular.  Bradley Whitford, Timothy Busfield, and of course, Mr. Perry, to name a few. Guest stars like Sting, John Goodman, and Christine Lahti made appearances as well.  Each and every cast member contributed well to the story.  The casting was immaculate.

The show reminded me of West Wing, another Sorkin show, in that it was shot dark, and involved a lot of activity, lots of dialog while people went places, through hallways, down stairs, around corners. I'm not a fan of low-light shows or movies. Everyone and everything is shadowed and I find that difficult to watch sometimes.  But that is seriously my only complaint about the show.

While the premise of this show was very similar to 30 Rock, which was in the lineup at the same time, it wasn't that kind of comedy...it was many things, including funny, but funny in a smart, thoughtful, dry way.  It was just a different animal entirely.  30 Rock made it, Studio 60 didn't. I think the timing was unfortunate, and it's a darn shame.  I highly recommend watching this series.

But Aaron Sorkin wrote this the same way he wrote The Social Network: each episode is a slowly unfolding drama with no discernible climax (except the first and the final episodes) wrapped in flashbacks to an even more boring parallel drama from a few years prior. This is blue balls as television - over and over again you become enthralled in suspenseful rising action, but then it just fades away without reaching fruition.

Also, the dialogue is on the same level as Gilmore Girls: the characters constantly pummel one another with witty parlays at an unrealistic speed, often spitting out the perfect rejoinder before the other character has expressed his thought. This unnatural conversation separates the characters from the viewer. This may help Sorkin feel superior, but it gets tiring within the first three episodes. The desperate attempts to weave relevant social issues into the plot do not humanize the characters.

So if you like The Social Network, Gilmore Girls and/or the sensation of blue balls, you might enjoy this show. Otherwise, I recommend only watching the first and last episodes, skipping the mushy middle.",1314489600,,1321,5.0504587155963305

Studio 60, an irreverent comedy show with a brain, comes from the people that brought you West Wing. Fast paced, tacky, inappropriate, sharp and funny.

The program is about the making of a show like Saturday Night Live. The pilot brings most of the cast together. But the show after the pilot sets the ""stage"" for the series. The CLOCK resets and mocks.  Guest stars in the short lived series are varied and surprising. Even John Goodman appears as a Judge. No topic is sacred in this series. Race, religion, politics, drugs, unwed pregnancy, friendships, former lovers and all are open game.  Some of the ""comedy sketches"" in the show inside the show are not as funny as they should be. And the last few episodes they tried to tie up story lines that were meant to take years to resolve so they feel a bit forced and rushed. But by that point, fans of the show wanted to see ""how does it end"" and the writers did a decent enough job doing that. If you haven't seen the series. Take advantage of the online opportunity and do it now.

More an observation than a critique, it has a quality that reminds me I'm watching a show made amidst the Bush years before Obama was elected. It's sometimes easy to forget how much our culture has changed in the past few years, but the issues grappled with in the show over, primarily, religion are in a time capsule as we seem to have collectively moved on from many of those issues (not that they have gone away, but the religious right is no longer the massive force it was when this show was on).",1304121600,,669,4.267716535433071

First off you have the cast. Like both the West Wing and, to a lesser extent, Sports Night, the casting is perfect. I cannot imagine this show without a single one of the actors. Matthew Perry, who was my favorite friend, manages to mix humor and romance perfectly as writer Matt Albie. Bradley Whitiford plays a character totally different than his character on the West Wing and plays him perfectly. I especially enjoyed his political rant from the Harriet Dinner.

In my opinion the best type of Tv shows are ensemble show(Friends, Babylon 5, The West Wing, The Practice, delectably Glee, ect) so maybe I was naturally biased toward this show. I also am interested in seeing what goes on behind the scenes of things.

I am a writer and an actor so I enjoyed the stuff about those things.

This show was a work of genius. The writing was quick, and dry. The characters were well cast, and have a great balance of comedic and dramatic volley. I can't believe it didn't have a few more seasons, and I think it was due to the fact that the advertising for this show wasn't very abundant. It took a few episodes to get going, but once you figured out the characters and got in the groove it really took off. Some people have said that it's trying too hard to be ""smart"", but I think it wasn't trying to be anything it wasn't.

Studio 60 is NOT West Wing, nor does it try to be.  By assuming this, you would assume the producers and writers and actors are myopic, one-note performers and talent.

This show provides an insiders' perspective on TV with no hold ""barred"" assessement and critique of the very TV medium it portrays.

It's been a couple days since I finished it and I still have this empty feeling in my stomach, I want so badly for more. I want to watch what happens with Danny, Jordan & baby.

Well I do, and now I'll never be able to check in with them again.

I know this show was expensive to produce (~3 million an episode I believe?) and that its ratings needed to be sky high to support that kind of a budget, but I really wish they had given the show a second season to demonstrate what could happen if it really gelled. One season was enough to have me fully hooked.

Amanda Peet plays the new hot-shot network executive, hired on Studio 60's worst night and in charge of restoring the network's public image.  Look for tons of cameos by Masi Oka, Sting, John Goodman, and Felicity Huffman.

But 30 Rock was slapstick comedy, a product of the same late-night comedy genre it satirized.  Studio 60 is a full-featured drama with a splendid ensemble cast of Aaron Sorkin regulars and a couple of outstanding new faces -- Steven Weber clearly the most outstanding as the network president.  All of Sorkin's signature touches, sometimes overwrought dialogue, and quirky staging are present, and (to my eyes, at least) none of them annoy.  People who enjoy serious backstage drama with a fine undertone of comedy will appreciate this series, which is surely on its way to ""cult classic"" status.  It was high-end TV when it ran, and it's a sad reflection on American viewers that it didn't pick up enough of an audience to last.",1268697600,2,832,4.79020979020979
1576910,4,B00005JPI6,"Love the series, though there are a few things to consider:

Sorkin puts a lot of his life over the past several years into the plot/scripts, which is not bad, but makes it pretty real, which isn't what the public in general looks for.  If you want a story that escapes from the production business, this isn't for you.

If you're expecting great SNL-style humor from the clips of ""Studio 60,"" again, this isn't for you -- it's not about the show, it's about the people that create and produce the show.

From the technical level -- we had an issue with discs 3 and 4 reading properly, from multiple DVD players, so make sure to test (i.e., fully view/play) the full series shortly after you receive it to make sure it functions properly.  The replacement we received was just fine, so this may be an isolated issue.

1576911,5,B00005JPI6,"Ask any screenwriter, screenwriting guru, or person who is interested in real storytelling, and they'll tell you that the real entertainment of the twenty-first century is in television, Cable mostly, but occasionally a show on Primetime comes along, or a show on basic cable comes along, and the dialogue cracks off the screen, the show erupts with humor, drama, love, romance, (occasionally violence and sex though not in this show--and that's a brilliant plus in this show), and draws you into a well created story that wraps you into the characters, their lives, their love, and their humanitiy.  It's humanity that runs through the undercurrents of this brilliant show that could've offered us years of stories, but cut down in favor of the lobotimized 30 Rock (which had lower ratings and lower critical acclaim than Studio 60) because 30 Rock was cheaper--the irony for anyone who watches the first five minutes should be aware.

This show, though several subplots are left open--they don't feel as if they're unfinished--ends very well, with almost all character archs for the series comfortably ended (capable of more development, but no cliff hangers).  It's a genius series, Aaron Sorkin's brilliant dialogue, quick witted ideas, and well crafted characters shows an innate genius for atmosphere, story, and especially dialogue.  This is nothing like The West Wing, and again that's a good thing (though The West Wing is brilliant and people who enjoy this will enjoy The West Wing, and vice-versa).

If you love television, if you love quick witted educated dialogue and stories that don't treat the viewer like a moron, but doesn't complicate (though occasionally makes complex) or attempt to be arty or esoteric or surreal.  It just makes realistic, entertaining characters, that wrap you into their stories, and bring you into their lives.  This show plays like a 900+ minute movie, that's what it feels like to me, something you want to sit down and just watch and watch and watch in one or two days.

He tries to get her back, even though they have some pretty serious irreconcilable differences.  As Sorkin writes this couple, the show feels almost like stalking.  Art may have suffered, but the insight into some very private issues was stunning and creepy.

If you've been wishing Jeff Bartlett could run for a third term, check out ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."" Aaron Sorkin, creator of ""The West Wing,"" is also responsible for this one-season series about life backstage at the West Coast competitor to ""Saturday Night Live."" I couldn't help suspecting the show lasted only one season because it bit too close to the bone for television.

Bradley Whitford, Bartlett's deputy chief of staff on ""The West Wing,"" plays Danny Tripp, Studio 60's producer. He is teamed with Matthew Perry as Matt Albie, the show's chief comedy writer (and possibly Aaron Sorkin's alter ego). Allison Janney, Bartlett's press secretary and ultimately chief of staff, appears in one segment as herself and the week's host for ""Studio 60.""

The tension of being funny every Friday night is no less gripping than, say, 500 well-armed Haitian troops invading the U.S. Embassy in Port au Prince. Politics enters into the plot almost exclusively in nonstop conflict with television industry censors. Romance is the main plot-turner here. Matt Albie has a conflict-riddled on-again, off-again love affair with one of his stars, comedienne Harriet Hayes, played by Sarah Paulson. He also has a drug problem. And Danny Tripp (spoiler alert!) falls reluctantly in love with the network boss, Jordan McDeere, played by Amanda Peet.

1576984,5,B00005JPI6,"Sometimes it feels empowering to be a little smarter then the ""Norm"". That the time and hard work spent improving one's mind, one's perspectives and one's talents, was well spent. Most of the time, though, it's just plain frustrating, that nobody seems to ""get"" you. That your ideas and concepts are a long way from being heard or understood by the folks around you. On days like that, and there must be lots of them for him, it must be pretty hard to be Aaron Sorkin.

Aaron crafts characters 'out of plain words' that build people, about whom we think ""I wish  I could be more like him...or her."" Characters who make honorable choices, about life, love, career, ethics, relationships...and who stick around to deal with the fallout and consequences of those choices, rather than hitting and running away to hide.

Studio 60 is nearly as filled with these types of characters as was The West Wing. Sadly, it was just a bit too far ahead of it's time and was cancelled just as it was hitting full stride.

I've only watched the first eight  of the 22 episodes in this ""Complete Series"", six-disk, boxed-set, because, like sipping a fine wine, I prefer to savor the experience, a small taste at a time.

If you're a person who'd like to believe that there is intelligent life on this planet...that it's not just ""A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury (like Fox News) signifying nothing."" then this is, in fact, MUST SEE TV.

Television creates templates of possible realities. We watch it, learn a set of values and style choices, and work toward being a little more like the characters we identify with. These characters we can ill afford to miss.

Aaron, I think you're casting your pearls before swine, most of the time, but thanks for making the effort, from someone who does ""get"" you!",1253577600,3,1799,4.617554858934169

The only thing that kept me from joining the Taliban when West Wing went off the air leaving W in the Oval Office was the thought that Aaron Sorkin had a new pilot and I didn't think Afghanistan had broadband yet. I loved West Wing so much that I memorized every line and made my elderly parents addicts. But I think I might love Studio 60 more, despite the occasional unevenness. Because ""Nevada Day"" alone -- and it's not -- is enough to cover a multitude of sins.

Only if you've ever tried to produce really good television can you comprehend how unbelievably ambitious this project was. Because it's about love -- love of the truth, love for your work, love for your co-conspirators, love for your family, love for life, love for the love of your life, and love for what could be if only you had the courage to out-grip death.

I hadn't seen Studio 60 since it went off the air, and I suddenly was desperate to see it again. Watching it again, I was reminded that television is not about nothing -- television can actually be about everything that is most important to us.

To me, this show reminds me of Arrested Development, another amazing show and my favorite, but with a little less humor; to make up for that, the drama, of which Arrested Development had very little, is incredibly engaging and portrays a very accurate description of what a show like SNL is like in the background while it's airing.

Don't get me wrong, though: the humor is still very, very funny. It starts picking up after a few episodes when they've established the basic story premises and just keeps getting better from there. I'm sure the writers realized the show was going to be canceled so they threw in as many jokes as they had, but if that's just another reason to buy this DVD, so be it.",1246838400,2,919,4.530120481927711

I went through all 6 disks in only four days, and those were 8 - 10 hour work days.  Anyone who appreciates Aaron Sorkin's clever writing (The American President, The West Wing, etc.) will love this.

The one quibble would be that this is mostly ""shovelware;"" there's little in the way of extras.

I'll have to admit that as the show progressed and the story lines evolved, I was focusing more on the dialog between the main characters, so natural so genuine. It reminded me of three other series that didn't make it but were also superbly written: Tattinger's, Twin Peaks and Grapevine. In terms of theme and storyline, these shows were the antithesis (can you have antithesis with three?)  of each other: one a drama, one a spoof of itself and the third a comedy that broke the fourth wall. Back to Studio 60. I loved it because it was dark and the action moved quickly, driven by the dialog; there was no laugh track and only incidental music.

From the camera work to the character building to the dialog, there's a unique stamp on his work that others may try to emulate, but never can duplicate.  The fast paced, witty dialog made the shows all feel like they were 10 minutes long, becuase there was a suspension of awareness of your surroundings while watching.

1577047,5,B00005JPI6,"I have a friend. This friend is blind. He has been since birth. He watches television, well... he listens to it. And a few months back, he and I were discussing Aaron Sorkin's writing skills. My friend told me that since the first episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sports-Night-The-Complete-Series-Boxed-Set/dp/B00006IRH9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sports Night - The Complete Series Boxed Set</a>, he has loved Sorkin's ability to (as he put it) ""challenge my ears to stand up and pay attention."" We both agreed, my friend and I, that Sorkin is a master of the spoken word. He uses dialogue better than anyone writing in American cinema or television today. And STUDIO 60 was no exception. My friend told me that STUDIO 60 was one of the most enticing shows his ears had ever enjoyed. So when my friend heard that STUDIO 60 was being cancelled, he was very upset. I was too. My friend told me that watching STUDIO 60 made him ""feel as if I could see the action right in front of me."" It made my friend think. It made him feel. But most of all, it made him SEE. I hope I am not putting too fine a point on it... but STUDIO 60 - and specifically Sorkin's use of language and tempo - gave my friend a sense of what it might be like to enjoy a television show with ALL of his senses.

Those were my friend's feelings; these are mine. I second everything my friend spoke about Sorkin and his immense talent with language. He also loves women. Not in the way you think I mean... I mean this guy adores writing for female characters. Every single one of the female characters that Sorkin has ever created have such presence, such guts. He gives them every ounce of respect, then he ratchets up their intelligence and moxy to a level rarely seen on television. You can tell he really respects women.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sports-Night-The-Complete-Series-Boxed-Set/dp/B00006IRH9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sports Night - The Complete Series Boxed Set</a>&nbsp;was a fantastic show (and well ahead of its time) with strong female characters that matched their male counterparts blow for blow.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-West-Wing-The-Complete-First-Four-Seasons-4-Pack/dp/B0007OY2PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The West Wing - The Complete First Four Seasons (4-Pack)</a>&nbsp;(at least the first four seasons) was even better, giving Allison Janney tons of meaty material to sink her acting skills into. (But when Sorkin left the show, I did as well.) Then came STUDIO 60. Again, strong female characters equal in every way to their male counterparts... but... I will readily admit that when the show first began its short lived run on Monday nights, I found it to be a bit difficult to care about. More to the point, I found the relationship between Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) difficult to care about. All they ever seemed to do was fight. But as the episodes progressed... and specifically after the two month hiatus that NBC put the show into from March through early May 2007... I found myself rooting for them. The show became as exhilarating as anything Sorkin has done. Who could forget when John Goodman stole the show (and won an Emmy) for his portrayal of a kind hearted, rural town Judge in the two part Nevada Day episodes? When he wagged his finger at Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) and ordered him to ""Stop thinking everyone living between (New York) and (Los Angeles) just stepped out of the cast of Hee-Haw. Tell your friends!"" Or the very end of The Disaster Show when Cal Shanley (Timothy Busfield) reminds Allison Janney that ""it sure beats digging holes for a living."" Or the moment when Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) reminds Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) in both the Pilot and The Christmas Show that ""we live here now."" Or The Christmas Show itself, when the displaced musicians from New Orleans were spotlighted during a soulful rendition of O' Holy Night? If you did not shed at least a small tear as that song ended, then you have no soul. Or most of all, the four part K&R story arc that brought the horrors of war home for one character in particular. I cannot list all of the great moments from STUDIO 60 because there are far too many. Like others here have mentioned, the show caused me to laugh AND to cry in the same one hour time span. THAT is saying a lot.

I have read other reviews commenting that ""if you did not get it, poor you."" I don't think ""getting it"" had anything to do with the shows cancellation. When one considers that NBC chose to replace STUDIO 60 with a show entitled THE NATIONAL SINGING BEE... one can clearly see that ""getting it or not getting it"" was never a factor in the decision. NBC was clearly catering to the lowest common denominator. THE NATIONAL SINGING BEE instead of STUDIO 60? You've got to be kidding me. I cannot give a good reason for the shows cancellation. I doubt very strongly that anyone can. Sorkin knew this might happen. He's been there before. That's why, during the episode titled Breaking News, Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) tells network exec Jack Rudolph (Steven Weber) ""Ratings are cyclical, Jack. Who the hell knows why anybody watches anything?""

Lastly, as to the release of the show on DVD, I have two issues that had me strongly considering giving this set only four stars instead of five - which the SHOW ITSELF clearly deserved.

1. The title: Calling this set THE COMPLETE SERIES insults the viewers understanding that the show itself was NEVER INTENDED to run for only one season. I have no doubt that Sorkin and the cast intended to see this show run for many years. Did Warner Brothers home video actually think that consumers would be confused if they had simply labeled this set THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON? I knew there was never going to be a Season Two once the show was cancelled...

2. The Audio Commentary: During the Pilot episode on disc one, both Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme provide a brief discussion/commentary on the show and its inception. One glaring omission, however, is evident throughout. The commentary was recorded WHILE THE SHOW WAS STILL IN PRODUCTION, therefore, NO DISCUSSION IS EVER PRESENTED AS TO THE REASON FOR OR TIMING OF THE SHOW'S CANCELLATION. The cancellation is never even mentioned. I feel that in NOT allowing Sorkin to comment on the show's demise robs BOTH the producers AND the fans of a vital piece of the puzzle. Personally, I was searching for some kind of explanation on this matter. Namely: Was Sorkin given a chance to alter the final story arc to coincide with the show's cancellation? Did he completely re-write the show's ending to suit the network decision? None of this comes to light on the discs, as the commentary quickly shows.

That said, I am pleased to have this boxed set in my Sorkin Collection. The show took some time to build momentum, and that leads me (and many others) to wonder what if? What if there had been a Second Season? Oh well. Like I said at the start of this review... the show was so good even a blind man could see it. Too bad NBC execs were too blind to do the same. Here is to hoping for more of the same from Sorkin and company. After all, it sure beats digging holes for a living.",1231804800,5,7343,4.903459372485921

1577103,4,B00005JPI6,"While Aaron Sorkin has shown that he is a good writer by creating memorable characters on shows like Sports Night and The West Wing, Studio 60 never made it far enough to be considered great. While I personally liked the show I can see why people have disagreed with it.

I won't go into detail about what it's about as it is already talked about in other people's synopsis', but it had potential. Besides flaws here and there that all shows have in their first seasons, the show was pretty good. The DVD to this show, however, wasn't given much thought. With only one commentary by Sorkin and Schlamme and an early made short documentary on the show, the DVD isn't good. Fans of the show will hopefully one day get a revised edition like Sports Night, but they will be disappointed by this one.

Not as good as Sports Night and not close to The West Wing, Studio 60 is a good show if you have the time to sit back and enjoy another Sorkin show.",1229299200,,945,4.333333333333333

1577105,5,B00005JPI6,"Adding my voice to the chorus of praise for this show is somewhat redundant.  Anyone considering buying this DVD surely knows the affection the Sorkin/Schlamme team inspires in their fans.  If Studio 60 is not overall as good as the West Wing series, it's certainly as good as West Wing's first season, and who knows how far the show could have gone had it been able to continue?  Although the show-within-the-show was a sketch comedy, Studio 60 is more of a Dramedy.  I don't think it was cancelled because people didn't know what to make of it - Desperate Housewives does very well and it's got a similar combination of drama and comedy.  So where did this series go wrong?

The problem is clearly not with the cast.  Sorkin alumni from the West Wing are abundant: Studio 60 regulars Matthew Perry, Timothy Busfield (who also directed some Sports Night episodes), and Bradley Whitford  were on West Wing.  Many of the Studio 60 guest stars are also old Sorkinites: Allyson Janney, John Goodman, Felicity Huffman (from Sports Night).  The direction is sure-handed and knowing.  The writing surely equals that on most of Sorkin's films and is second only to West Wing in intellegence.  The conflict between the athiest Matt and the born-again Christian Harriet is surprisingly even-handed (although Harriet is perhaps not as articulate about her faith as President Bartlett).  In fact, the second heart of the show (after the Matt-Danny dynamic) is the athiest-Christian conflict that so polarises the United States (and also France and other western democracies).  The show handles the conflict as even-handedly as any I have ever seen, this coming from a Christian that also resolutely supports the separation of Church and State.  There's also some race relations commentary when the (only) black cast member decides to take a young black comedian under his wing.

No, I think the show failed in trying to rise above its genre.  People watching the West Wing would expect things like the Israeli-Palastinian conflict to arise, or school shootings, or terrorism.  That a show about comedy writers and performers should cover topics like the Afghanistan (and Iraq) War, the Patriot Act, and Red State-Blue state conflict might turn off viewers who watch TV for escapism (especially as the news itself covered enough of this material to sate the average viewer).  It's not denigrating the national audience to point out that light fare does better in times of conflict.

For me, the show definitely goes off the rails for several episodes in the middle of the season.  When Amanda Peet's pregnancy became incorporated into the storyline, something strange happened.  The most important relationship in the show - that between Danny and Matt - became subsumed to the Danny-Jordan and Matt-Harriet relationships.  I think the show's writers recognized it, and the last episodes (the 4-part K&R) were easily the equals to the earlier episodes.  The contrast can easily be seen in the three multipart shows - Nevada was very good, The Harriet Dinner was awful, and K&R was back to very good.

So what else is there to say?  I can echo the praise of the show as a whole (""You definitely should buy this DVD!""). I can echo the disappointment at the lack of extras (but the West Wing DVDs were equally disappointing).  But the bottom line is that I haven't enjoyed a show this much since the West Wing was cancelled (and that includes the recent seasons of the Simpsons), so add my voice to the chorus of praise for the show.",1228089600,,3518,4.908629441624366
1577106,4,B00005JPI6,"I am a huge Sorkin fan, and this season was no disappointment.  The only reason I am not giving it a perfect rating is because it is hard to get excited to watch a season 1 when you know there will not be a season 2, and a lot of things will be left unresolved.  I wish this season had done better, because it was classic Sorkin, with a lot of ex-West Wing actors/actresses returning with new roles.

Overall, you will enjoy it, but you will be disappointed that there is no follow-up once you are done with the one and only season.",1227744000,2,532,4.145631067961165
1577107,5,B00005JPI6,"I am currently living in Australia and wasn't able to watch this while it was airing.  I actually purchased the show on iTunes to watch while on the airplane during a trip back to the states. I really wished I had the meager extras provided on the DVD set because that would give me just that much more.  Watching it was very hard, because I knew that every episode that I watched was one less till the end.

As with all Aaron Sorkin scripts, the dialog is very fast and dynamic. It is very intelligent and assumes you are as well. The show doesn't feel as polished or as snappy as Westwing but you can easily see it was going there. I understand that the show was very expensive to produce, but was pretty obvious that it was just taking a beat to find its rhythm.  I believe I read somewhere that the show had the highest increase in ratings numbers if you include people who used a DVR to record the show to watch later.

Although a lot of my political beliefs are opposite of Aaron Sorkin, as with West Wing, I never really felt he was treating my position unfairly.  His characters were all well done.  I especially liked that Matthew Perry showed he isn't still Chandler from Friends. I also think D. L. Hughley did a great job.

The actual endings of the show was a bit of a let down.  It felt like a quick, ""Well the show is ending, quick lets tie off all these ends.""  Granted, I guess that is better than just leaving us hanging. But with the quality of the rest of the writing, I expected that 'tie off' to be handled better.

I thought the name of the show was a bit off. When I first heard about it, I pictured a 90210-ish type show set in a night club ala ""Studio 54."" I imagine Aaron Sorkin's first show, ""Sports Night"" had the same problem. Seeing either of these shows listed in the TV guide, I wouldn't have watch them because of assumptions I would have made about them based on their name.",1222732800,2,1909,4.245856353591161

1577209,5,B00005JPI6,"I knew ten minutes into episode one I'd be adding this show to my library.  I expect I also knew it could not endure beyond a first season and would perforce become a great 19 hour ""movie""; no network was likely to order a second season of a show so keenly self-reflective of America during the calamitous ""W"" years.  It's one of those dramas that tells us more about ourselves than most of us care to know.

In decades to come sociologists may use this series to illustrate that there was some self-reflection as America went so horrendously off-the-rails in the first decade of the 21st century.  There is a paucity of writers like Mr. Sorkin skillful enough to dramatize the fissures in our grand republic.  Sorkin and his team have all our post-9/11 core issues dancing here, enacted with wit, invective, charm and skill.

The romance between Matt and Harriet is a sublime metaphor for the media-induced divisions between ""red and blue"" states.  The three episode arc called ""K&R"" should be required viewing for anyone hoping to write television drama.

That ""30 Rock"" (a show I enjoy) should endure and Studio 60 suffer a quick death only bears out the old adage ""if you're going to tell people the truth about themselves, you'd better make them laugh while you do it.""  Were we simply not ready to confront ourselves while ""W"" was still in the Oval Office""?  (Are we ready now?)

1577211,5,B00005JPI6,"Studio 60 is one of the best TV shows to have aired in the last decade. Departing from the usual and constant blab present on our air, Studio 60 is the real deal. A smart and unbelievably crafted screenplay, casting actors which seemed to have been born for this show and only this show. If my words are not to be believed, then perhaps the fact that the series was canceled in the middle of its first season should clarify what I have said above. Lack of an audience wasn't the only problem faced by the network; the real problem has proven to be the show's content.

 I never watched the show as it aired one year ago, and I have few reasons why I haven't completely given up on my three weekly hours of television, but all the buzz had to catch on sometime, and after glancing at ""The Wrap Party"" at a friend's house, I had to indulge in the other 21 episodes. And let me tell you, from the first episode of this first season until the very last one, television becomes what it should have been all along. Pure and brilliant entertainment.

 If the ratings are a direct response to content (as Studio 60 clearly states that it is) then we have a huge problem here. When a country turns in mass to watch mentally deprived individuals fight off their personal lives on stage, and completely ignore and reject content such as Studio 60 then the conclusion that most of our population is illiterate and uneducated is inevitable. It is this simple - good shows don't stay on because they have no appeal. Intelligent discussion about religion, politics, love, literature, history and whatever topic covered in these twenty-two episodes were not enough to captivate people, or perhaps they just didn't understand it at all. Studio 60 is still entertainment, and like the fictitious show bought by character Jordan McDeere, perhaps it was bought by the wrong network and for the wrong public.

 Many have accused Studio 60 of being too smart, and those who enjoyed the show delusional about their own intelligence, but nothing could be further from the truth here. Studio 60 had flaws all around, but I still stand by the first sentence in this amateur review. Author Aaron Sorkin should have known that you can only talk so much about a sketch before finally airing it. Not presenting it for the home audience was delusional. Perhaps this was his worst and most regrettable decision, after all the show inside the show is a comedy. Studio 60 definitely needed more time to find itself, something which was clearly not possible, and it pays to bear in mind that no show will ever satisfy the majority. It has been said before that Aaron Sorkin's worst is still an awful lot better than others out there; however, Studio 60 is far from his worst. It is the most insightful and crafted to date.

You go through an emotional roller coaster and the clever annecdotes that each of the characters add helps the show become more great.

It sounds like hyperbole, but this is really what television should be like - only a handful of shows ever reach this level of intelligence and emotional depth.

Fast-paced intelligent adult drama that concerns real issues involving characters with honor and dignity.  Even characters that you dislike end up stepping up to the plate and showing their mettle.  And it's often very funny as well.  Sorkin clearly loves all his characters and is careful to treat them all with respect (and how often does one see that on TV?).

Although cancelled fairly early, the writers did manage to round off the series at the end, so have no fear that you'll be left hanging at the end of the series.",1213056000,2,830,4.612244897959184

I loved everything about the series, naturally the writing (thank you Mr Sorkin), the direction - the West Wing revisited with the constant talking, walking, multiple conversations at the one time, the actors - all great a pleasure to watch.  It is rare to become totally absorbed in watching television with all the potential external interruptions, the phone ringing (did it?); the dog barking (sorry honey didn't hear her) the daughter fighting with the boyfriend (you're still seeing him?).

It's all there: humor, corporate intrigue, politics, religion, culture, race, sex (the subject, not the physical act, I mean). And the set is amazing: the backstage of a SNL-like show.  I understand why the series' economics wouldn't do it.  The cast is overwhelmingly expensive (especially Bradley Whitford, The West Wing's Josh Lyman, and Matthew Perry, Friends' Chandler Bing) and America is nos as excited about TV humor shows as they are for the White House.  In Studio 60, characters are more like real people, which have major flaws such as drug addictions, are workaholics, have trouble mantaining their relationships.  Perry is fantastic.  Aside from a few gestures and phrases, he plays a whole different character from Chandler.  But Whitford looks like a rerun of Josh Lyman.",1210723200,,959,5.2631578947368425

It's funny.  It's Smart.  The whole cast was unbelievable.  The show Studio 60 dubs as SNL behind the scenes. They had me from the 1st 10 min. when Judd Hirsch went on live tv telling people to ""turn the channel! Really! Turn off your tv. That remote you have in your hand is a crack pipe.""  The Christmas episode was by far my fav.  Wonderful Music every show.  THE CAMERA SHOTS are to die for. Everything was perfect.

1577281,2,B00005JPI6,"I absolutely adored The West Wing, so I was naturally very excited for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Sadly, however, the series was just plain bad.

Exhibit A: Bradely Whitford. He plays essentially the exact same character he played in The West Wing. It's sad that this wasn't a more defined character, especially as it is far less entertaining without a Donna type character.

Exhibit B: Humor. The West Wing had a great dry wit to it, and often would cause you to laugh out loud at least once an episode. Strange, then, that a show about comedy writers wasn't more funny. Studio 60 does have its funny moments, but on the whole it takes itself far, far too seriously.

Exhibit C: Sorkin's Soapbox. So, so, soooooo many episodes revolved around Christianity. I don't mind this. But I DO mind that 1) The approach taken to it isn't particularly intelligent or interesting and 2) It comes up so freaking much. C'mon, Sorkin. Surely you can think of other things to write about.",1207526400,8,978,4.641618497109826
1577282,5,B00005JPI6,"I like to watch television series from start to favorite and have over three dozen complete runs to enjoy.  My standard practice is to watch one episode a day for the series I am going through, although I might go back-to-back with a two-parter.  But when I decided to watch the one season of ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" I went through all 22 episodes in five days (it would have been less but I had other things to watch, classes to teach, time to spend sleeping, etc.).  When my wife heard what I was doing she decided to lie in bed for two days and watching the entire series from start to finish.  So that would be a pretty good indication of how much we liked the late and lamented television series from Aaron Sorkin.

I am enthralled the art of writing and so wish that when it comes to writing that my attention span was better suited to actual works of literature than writing reviews.  With this television show I get to appreciate both the writing of the episodes and the parts in the episodes where people are writing.  But the bottom line remains that I simply love the way Sorkin writes and have yet to reach my saturation point with watching (although I should really say ""listening"") repeats of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-West-Wing/dp/B000HC2LI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The West Wing</a>"" the way I have other series that I love (Yes, I know that Sorkin only produced and wrote the first four seasons of the show, but those were the best ones and I would swear that those who wrote in his wake were trying to emulate his style).  It goes without saying that the same comments apply to Sorkin's first television series, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sports-Night/dp/B00006IRH9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sports Night</a>.""

Beyond that, I find this television shows particularly affecting.  I think I got choked up more often watching ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" than for any single season of any television show I have ever seen.  I do not just mean getting teary eyed over all of the life and death questions resolved in the final episode (""What Kind of Day Has It Been""), or when Harriet tells Matt ""You knock my sox off,"" or when Danny tells Jordan ""I'm coming for you.""  I mean things like when Matt bet Jeannie $10,000 that the number of people who liked her ""Commedia dell'arte"" routine is going to go from two to three people (""The Focus Group"").  My wife probably cried more often than I did watching the show, which apparently speaks to a hitherto unrecognized point of commonality between our disparate natures, but once again reinforces our shared affection for the series.

This is not to say the show was perfect, because it was not.  My first fear that the series might be fatally flawed came in the second episode where we did not get to see the Crazy Christian skit and were instead treated to reworked lyrics for a Gilbert & Sullivan songs that were okay, but not memorable.  You can only talk about a killer skit so much before you have to show the damn thing.  Of course that means you have to write an absolutely killer skit and maybe it is the case that Sorkin never tired, but what matters in the end is that we never get to see any of it in the show.  Because the point is the show behind the show we do not get to see that much of the show in front of the show behind the show, and what we do see is not stellar late night sketch comedy.  The takeoff on Nancy Grace was pretty good and I liked the dry wit of the White House press conferences, but the news segments never amounted to much of anything.  For me the funniest bit of the entire season was the running gag in ""The Harriet Dinner (1)"" of Harriet's inability to tell a joke, although I have to say it is a toss-up between Holly Hunter and Dolphin Girl for which of Harriet's voices cracks me up more.

I know that Sorkin is condemned as a liberal, but he certainly writes some of the best political characters.  That was true on ""The West Wing"" with characters from Ainsley Hayes to Arnold Vinick, with the likes of Christopher Mulready and Sheila Brooks in between, and with Harriet Hayes we find Sorkin doing for evangelical Christians what he did for conservative Republicans (I always thought it would have been interesting to continue ""The West Wing"" with a Republican president to show that dramatic political storytelling is not just the province of the left).  Ultimately what makes Harriet a fascinating character is that despite the inherent contradiction, she is never going to give up her faith in God or her love for Matt.  The question is whether he will ever stop taking one step backwards for every step forward in his relationship with here.  Sorkin and his talented ensemble cast knew the show was over by the time they got to the final episode and were already to provide a sense that the characters go on even if the series does not, which provides some small measure of comfort.  I certainly appreciate that because tonight I start watching ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnivale/dp/B000FL7C8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnivale</a>,"" a series HBO jettisoned before the end was even in sight.",1207440000,10,5257,4.839285714285714

However, he used Studio 60 to get on his hobby horses far too much, ranting on about things that he obviously has a problem with.  Whilst it is not surprising that he dislikes the Christian right, his understanding of authentic Christian theology is seriously flawed, which means the debate within the show was pointless and misleading.  It got in the way of the entertainment value of the show, including the humour and character/relationship development - the things that made he West Wing the best show ever made.

Tthe producers were generous enough to use the same title sequence style as the West Wing, which put me in familiar territory.  The storylines are good, but I just didn't feel the paybacks are as satisfying as those in the WW.

The show's strengths come from a long list of accomplishments, of which these are the most evident:

1. A hugely talented cast led by Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford, whose on-screen bond is a joy to watch.

2. Well-scripted dialogues.  I found them  much easier to follow than those on The West Wing.

3.  Focus on characters' romantic lives.  An element that was sorely lacking in The West Wing.

4.  Great comedy sketches.

5. Great filming.  I always felt I was a ""fly on the wall"" watching a real nighttime comedy show and all its backstage happenings.

I could go on and on.....

This show made me cry, made me laugh, made me think, made me want to be 22 again, and go off to Hollywood to become a writer.

 Yes, it's true that sometimes it was a bit heavy-handed, and given that it was about a late night comedy show, it would have been good if it had  taken itself a bit less seriously from time to time.  However,  looking back on it, the show's biggest problem  was that it was not given a chance by the studio.  This show deserved a second season.

I shouldn't have been worried though.  Sorkin's writing once again provides us with strong, layered characters which form the basis of the show.  Perry (who leaves any doubt about being a one sitcom wonder behind) and Whitford (my favourite actor from the west wing) are both excellent, and the supporting cast is outstanding.  And the show is not just about the show within a show, Studio 60.  Sorkin uses the series to examine the stresses and beauty of a creative life, the tension between art and commerce, and, in the glorious 4 episode arc that finishes the show, Sorkin returns to politics and the lingering effect of 9/11.  Studio 60 is not, however perfect.  Some of the B and C plots are boring or just plain silly, sometimes it's just not as funny as it could have been, and Amanda Peet is just not up to the task.

If nothing else, this show confirms one thing in my mind: Matthew Perry can definitely act, his star making turn in FRIENDS not at all a fluke.

For those who care, some SPOILERS follow.

The riveting debut episode deals with the shocking on-air blow-up of Judd Hirsch's character, the executive producer of the flagging live, late night sketch comedy show STUDIO 60. His 53-second tirade (ala Peter Finch's classic explosion from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000CNESU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>) causes him to be summarily sacked and leaves the show and its personnel in shambles. This sucks for Jordan McDeere (Amanda Peet) as this is her first day as new president to NBS, the network which boasts Studio 60 as its flagship show. Jordan's first move, a preemptive act against the upcoming public and media backlash, is to immediately hire back the team of writer Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and director/executive producer Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) to ramrod the show.

Matt and Danny, longtime best friends, had been fired from Studio 60 four years before in a cloud of controversy. Initially reluctant, the duo eventually decide to come back on board and attempt to bring the eroded show back to its former glory. Down the season STUDIO 60 goes on to reveal a comprehensive behind-the-scenes peek at the high pressured crafting of a weekly live sketch comedy show, as well as dropping insights into corporate business and the media. Of course, with regards to the behind the scenes reveals, there's no way the show can really delve into some of the truly dark stuff the SNL folks got into. And then there's the chronicling of the personal lives of the key characters. Not too surprisingly I got most caught up in Danny's courtship of Jordan and, even more, in the rocky romance of Matt Albie and the gorgeous and devout Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson). Ive really rooted for these last two, and never more so than when, over a live Sting performance, Harriet declared to Matt, ""You knock my socks off.""

SPOILERS end.

What a great, thought provoking show this is and how that much lower has the overall quality of television sunk now that it's gone. I have to mention the actors. The ensemble acting is superb. Top-of-the-foodchain props go to Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford, both excellent actors and sharing ridiculous chemistry in their scenes together. Also palpable is the rapport between Perry and Sarah Paulson. Amanda Peet lends a winning quality to Jordan McDeere. As the young, take-charge network president with something to prove, Amanda's Jordan is all guts and confidence yet hinting at vulnerabilites here and there. Another standout is Steven Weber, who turns in a dynamic performance as the ruthless, sneering, lovably loathsome NBS chairman. What happened to the nice guy from WINGS? I think Jack Rudolph sacked him.

To me, Sarah Paulson is a revelation. Her character is supposedly based on Kristin Chenoweth, whom Sorkin once dated. As Hannah Harriet Hayes, Paulson is simply stunning. The sequence in episode 5 ""The Long Lead Story"" - in which she unveils some personal life stories to a probing reporter - showcases a remarkable performance from her. Sarah Paulson glows. And she does a wicked Juliette Lewis impression.

With STUDIO 60 gone, this 6 dvd collection provides a kind of comfort, I guess. It even comes with two bonus features: a 24-minute-long behind the scenes featurette and audio commentary on the first episode by Aaron Sorkin and Tommy Schlamme. Even if, on the commentary, I got ticked off a bit as Sorkin and Schlamme insisted too much on detailing the background sets in lieu of giving interesting lowdowns on the actors and the dynamics of their characters' relationship.

STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP is rich in characterization, brims with behind-the-scenes stuff and controversial topics, and is wall-to-wall with smart dialogue and brittle romance. It's dramatic, suspenseful, funny, romantic, and cathartic. So, naturally, cancel the damn thing, right? Let's go a bit into this. One reason (and, admittedly, a big one) for the show's downfall is that the sketch comedy as written by Albie and his writing team never quite lived up to the billing. This undermines the credibility of the characters, who are supposed to know funny. For every good skits like ""Nicolas Cage - Couples Counselor"" and ""Meet the Press with Juliette Lewis"" there are flops like ""Science Schmience."" And I do wish we'd gotten to see the ""Crazy Christians"" sketch. It's also been said that the ratings decline can be blamed on Sorkin being too talky and preachy in his writing. I happen to disagree, but I guess intelligent, opinionated writing can ruffle feathers. And, of course, the two lengthy hiatus during the season didn't help. But, in my eyes, all these so-called flaws are so easily circumvented by the sheer quality of the show that I was still shocked when NBS - I mean, NBC - pulled the plug anyway. Sad, sad day.

But what's done is done. Chalk this one up as something not meant to be and maybe too close to home for comfort. But Sorkin and company can hold their heads high. STUDIO 60, while it lasted, was a beauty, and I'm sure this series will be the stepping stone for some of these very talented actors to something good. Good, but not better. STUDIO 60, it knocked my socks off.",1195948800,10,5870,5.062047569803516

In a television wasteland populated by vacuous and embarrassing unscripted reality shows, and weak copies of other mediocre shows it stood alone. It has been fascinating to read the reactions of viewers who came to the show late, or found it on iTunes or other formats. An astonished audience who could not understand why it was cancelled. Critics and viewers in other countries got it. For some reason Americans did not. It is sad there were only 22 episodes produced. But, they were produced as a whole and can be enjoyed like a mini-series. The DVDs will be wonderful to watch for years.  S60 will age well. It will be a clear snapshot of what imaginative and innovative television is like.

Chemistry between Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford is amazing. Amanda Peet is also very good. Interestingly, Steven Weber trumps everyone in the acting department. His scenes are the best.

Along with the biting and horrifyingly accurate show Action, this has to be the best show that never made it past a first season. But don't let that put you off buying it. It's 22 episodes of perfection. One feels that American TV is run by people who underestimate the intelligence level of its audience. It might be off the box but don't miss this show out of 'it's been cancelled, it can't be any good' prejudice. The dialogue sparkles as much as any West Wing episode. Watch out especially for the always watchable John Goodman in his Emmy winning cameo as a Nevada judge; the ongoing Matt/Harriet storyline, done with great charm; the electric chemistry between Perry and Whitford (they spark as well as their guitarist namesakes, look it up!) and the hugely moving New Orleans tribute episode.

If he would only get out a little more from the echo chamber of left wing politics he might be able to keep a show on the air for longer than one (Studio 60) or two (Sports Night) seasons. A little sublety would be a nice touch. Instead he pounds the viewer with a storyline that revolves around the ""courage"" of attacking the Christian Right and the cast's lone and apparently misguided Christian character. Someone needs to tell him that courage should be made of sterner stuff. Attack Muslim extremists with the same gusto and I'll be impressed. The cast is high quality and well suited to the task.

He has a great cast, with Matthew Perry and others as well as some really great cameos. However it does not really gel and in some ways it is not surprising. In many ways it is constructed in the same way as th West Wing visually. HOwever the topic is handled way too seriously. Probably that to some people this kind of television represents culturally something very important. However since it television that revolves aroud comedy and satire, probably that aspect is not apparent enough to give the real perspective. Indeed, the directing and acting is really excellent but somehow the whole thing comes off as very unfocused and at times it is extremely difficult to follow the story-lines. This is very often due to some very long dialogues which only work for the insiders and initiated. While this was really fascinating in the case of the West Wing because it gave an insight into the backstage of power, in this case it simply is tiring (come on, it is about a comedy show!). However there are some really wonderful parts and the quality is really very good but the subject should have been tackled somewhat differently and I am sure if the show would have continued this would have happened, due to the amount of talent involved.",1194652800,10,1338,4.697872340425532

1577525,3,B00005JPI6,"It's taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that this season was a pretty sizeable let down.

I've loved most of the things that Aaron Sorkin has ever written. I'm a huge fan of Sports Night and I own all seven West Wing seasons. I'm aware that Sorkin only penned the first four seasons, but he created the series and i like to think the writers tried to emulate him in the last 3 years.

But this show failed to live up to the promise of its pilot. The best 15 minutes of television that I think I've ever witnessed personally take place at the beginning of that episode.

After that, it just gets dark, depressing and not funny. I can only imagine that Sorkin was facing a bleak personal situation and was unable to access his funny bone, not unlike Douglas Adams when he wrote Mostly Harmless. I only hope that Sorkin is able to create something new and exciting before something horrible befalls him, like a heart attack or a meteor hitting him from space.

That being said, the show is still extremely intelligent. It's just not entertaining. And TV has to be. It's also good to remember that you never convince someone that they're wrong by calling them stupid. That's a message to my Sorkin fan bretheren.",1194566400,6,1225,4.431111111111111

Then came The West Wing, which never quite did it for me, because it DID stray over that line frequently, and was, quite frankly, a bit heavy handed. But it had a great cast, you have to admit.

Then came ""Studio 60."" When I watched the thing, my response was, ""Ugh, this is really awful."" I had a clear picture of who might be able to enjoy the non-stop, zing-zang-zoom, supercillious, and ultimately, patronizing dialog of this show: mediocre intellects who think they are REALLY REALLY smart and, almost by definition, lament how ""dumb"" everybody else is.

I knew even before I read them what many of the reviews here would say-- ""Mom and Pop America are just too dumb to GET this super-smart show.""

Please. This show had all the subtlety of a sledge-hammer. I'm pretty sure just about anybody could ""get"" Studio 60, as it was so heavy-handed one could hardly escape its point of the moment.

1577677,4,B00005JPI6,"I loved Sports Night, which had very little to do with sports other than as a backdrop to a bunch of semi-insane, neurotic people in the combined pursuit of an ESPN-like existence.  I liked the West Wing, which had a bit more to do with politics, but which was more about a bunch of semi-insane, neurotic people in the combined pursuit of political power.  So it should be no surprise that ""Studio60"" is Saturday Night Live as a backdrop to a bunch of semi-insane talent in the pursuit of redefining sketch comedy.

In other words, all Sorkin shows are essentially the same show. Only the names have been changed to protect the format.

So you either love Sorkin's band of loonies, or you don't. I happen to love them, but apparently after nearly a decade of the intrigues of the West Wing, returning to the Nielsen-nettling Sports Night was just a bit too much for NBC.  I was surprised, particularly after the exceptional hype-fest for the show, that they pulled the plug on Studio 60.  History with Sorkin shows is that they need at least 30-50 episodes before they hit full stride and the characters hit that comfort level of big wow comedy/drama. The West Wing had a backdrop that people may not know much better, but with the barrage of political coverage everywhere, the average  Joe probably feels more in tune with the political operatives of the Bartlett administration than with the neurotic and nimble cast of Studio 60.

I saw the show on iPod for this whole season. I couldn't wait to get on the treadmill at the gym and watch this roll out. Personally I wish they had had a USA or TNT rescue of this show. Cable could do well with Sorkin's intelligence. This was just a little too hip for the dim bulbs at GE/NBC/Universal.",1191110400,3,1738,4.583870967741936
1577678,4,B00005JPI6,"Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed this series; it's sharp and smart and quick and all the sorts of things one can associate with a show by Aaron Sorkin.

However, ""The West Wing"" (my favorite show) and ""Sports Night"" (my 2nd favorite show), which were both by Sorkin, far surpass this show because it is stuck between the two - not chronologically of course, but in terms of content.

""Studio 60"" doesn't know what it is.  ""Sports Night"" knew that it couldn't take itself too seriously because it was, at its most basic, a comedy with bits of soap opera-esque drama thrown into the mix.  ""The West Wing"" had incredibly funny moments but never forgot the weight of the drama behind it.  ""Studio 60"" had shown itself to be a comedy and instead forgot to leave the gravity at the door.  It was  such a mishmash that it toppled under its own weight.  Let is be said, though, that putting it in a 10 p.m. time slot wasn't the brightest move on the part of NBC.

However, these are just reasons why it failed on network TV.  Its success is in its humor, acting, and especially the writing, which is classic Sorkin - full of life and sparkle and wit.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, but make sure you don't want your comedy without intelligence.",1190851200,,1260,4.434782608695652
1577679,5,B00005JPI6,"If you saw the show, you don't need to have a rehash of its ""behind the scenes"" look.

I have been extolling the virtues of this show ever since I got hooked on it last season. Superb writing, great cast, plenty of pathos, humor and angst. An abundance of biting intelligence. So why was it shot down by NBC and ignored by a larger viewing audience?

Perhaps the major culprit was Aaron Sorkin himself, whose scripted pilot was frustratingly abysmal. If you got beyond the overloaded and too quickly paced first episode and hung in there, you were in for a great ride! (everyone I have implored to give the show a seoond chance after the pilot became hooked)!

Another reason it may have failed was the intial timeslot- up against the powerful CSI: Miami on Monday night. As viewership slipped in the first few weeks, NBC pre-empted, and began shifting it around, losing more of its potential audience. (Friday night would have been an ideal slot for it, btw). However, this show, had it been on TNT or FX instead, would have been a resounding hit and renewed for years, I believe.

Also, the confusion between this show and ""30 Rock"", both with ""behind the scenes"" concepts further eroded the base. This was a drama with humor, not a comedy!

The cast had great chemistry as an ensemble and some of the ""sketches"" such as the NIcholas Cage bit were brilliantly performed.

Matthew Perry at last exorcised his Chandler Bing persona; Bradley Whitford made you weep with his wooing of the gorgeous Amanda Peet; Sarah Paulson as Harriet gave a virtuoso performace each and every episode. DL Highley demostrated great acting chops in his first real dramatic role - check out his standoff with the great Steven Weber as a slimy newtwork chairman!

The final 3 episode ""arc"" is as fine a trilogy to conclude a series as this viewer has seen on the tube.

NBC replaced S60 with ""the Black Donnellys"", which immediately fell flat and was cancelled. And, sadly, all we are left with on Monday night is such drek as ""journeyman""- I give it 4 episodes before being yanked, and that's being generous!

Well the geniuses at NBC-Universal at least saw fit to release the set on DVD. It will become a classic, to be sure.

The networks persist in underestimating the intelligence of the audience and so we are left with the likes of According to Jim, Till Death, and reality shows. Marshall McLuhan was right- it is a vast wasteland. But at least we have S60 to enjoy over and over and introduce to friends.",1190678400,2,2492,4.630385487528344

Unfortunately by mid-season I just couldn't keep watching--this after loving nearly everything Sorkin's ever written, from The American President and A Few Good Men to Sports Night and West Wing. I think the biggest curse of this show was in its attempts to portray the onstage comedy of a backstage drama. The skits just weren't any good--no matter how much we might love Aaron Sorkin, no one could possibly have loved ""Science Schmience"" or that horrible G&S production number. Or any of the other skits that were used.
That being said, it follows that the ""geniuses"" of Danny and Matt weren't at all believable, nor any of the supporting writing staff, when we were given a weekly glimpse of their mediocre product. And Jordan never seemed like a brilliant executive either, in the same way that Mary McCormick's character on WW never seemed like a National Security Advisor. Have we ever needed a glimpse of Condi's cleavage?

If the show had focused on the Matt/Danny relationship, completely ignored attempts at sketch comedy, and taken Jordan's job more seriously, it might have had a fighting chance. Better luck next time, guys.",1189123200,7,1172,4.949238578680203

 So what made this different? Lets start with the writing. Aaron Sorkin did a TV show about behind the scenes show with Sports Night. However in Studio his wit is sharper. The story lines are well thought out, more thought out than 30 Rock.

Steven Weber, Matthew Perry, Bradford Whitford and Amanda Peet mesh as a cast, so why cancel a show wherethe cast works so well. Some of the scripts were uneven and sometimes puzzling in why they would do some of the things they do.

So why did this show fail? I think the audience wanted a show about a comedy show to be funny and not so dramatic. I wish someone would have given this show a chance...but the network didn't!

Well now we as a DVD audience can watch this show in his own season. We can  enjoy what NBC passed on and dream what could have happened. another intelligent show has bitten the dust, pray for intelligence!

This show was smart, intellectual, contemplative and had spunk and a generous portion of irreverent social commentary that should  have catapulted it into commercial stardom. For really how could a show not succeed with great actors and a strongly written scripts that challenge every concept that we claim to hold dear? Shouldn't we talk about these things? Shouldn't we interrogate our dear convictions and demand that they hold up under scrutiny? Shouldn't we all do this?

Unfortunately none of this is the point. Like it or not, ""right"" or wrong, you cannot win an argument if no one is listening. You cannot light the flame of discussion if you let yourself be canceled. Aaron Sorkin is an incredibly smart guy, but his greatest challenge is for him to realize that in some ways he is TOO smart.

As much as I love this show, Sorkin does sometime sound like he is preaching. He is right. I have hardly heard Sorkin saying anything that I didn't ultimately agree with, but again, that's doesn't matter. If 'Studio 60' had spent just a little more time dumbing-down it's message, perhaps it would still be on.

This is an imperfect analogy but compare this situation to the original Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry wanted to talk about inter-racial politics. He wanted to talk about corruption and tremendous injustice, BUT he knew he had to do it in a framework of fiction so he could conceal his controversial messages.

What I'm trying to say is simply this, you can only shout from the mountain tops as long as you can get people to listen. A prophet is no good to anybody buried 3 miles down in the bedrock. 'Studio 60' was too well written, too smart, too preachy and it was far too good for it's own survival. And now it's gone.

I wish I didn't live in a country of mostly stupid people, but I do. Surely if Studio 60's ratings we only based on California and New York, it would still be on. Perhaps

California,
Hawaii,
Illinois,
Iowa
Michigan,
Minnesota,
New Mexico,
New York,
Oregon,
Washington,
Wisconsin,
and most of New England should secede from the Union and form our own country. And the people in the other states should be legally barred from any further breeding.",1188518400,3,2294,4.72

You could not have asked for a better cast or performances in a TV series especially when compared with the crap on tv these days.

In all honesty, I suppose we should count ourselves lucky that a show this smart was ever allowed to see the light of day in the 21st century. For those who appreciate intelligent dialogue, taut drama, and social relevance, S60 was the holy grail in modern television. Buy this DVD and relish it; the time when intelligence mattered in entertainment is long, long gone.

It's upsetting to come to the realization that NBC has actually done what ""Studio 60"" was talking about; namely, canceling quality and most probably substituting quantity.

Forget that it an Aaron Sorkin show or the high profile cast that includes Amanda Peet and Matthew Perry, this show stands on it's own. It may not show the true cutthroat nature of SNL backstage, but what it does is balance comedy and drama better than any show I have ever seen. Perhaps that is the problem, NBC never knew how to market it. It will make you laugh, cry and sometimes it will make you think. The supporting cast puts in excellent performances and you will love the cameos and the supporting role by Ed Asner.

1577757,2,B00005JPI6,"I wanted to like this show; in fact, I was excited about it.  Matthew Perry was the only ""friend"" that I thought was really funny, and I was a fan of Sorkin's work (more on Sports Nite -- I thought the West Wing was a little overrated).  This show never really clicked for me, especially when I compared it to NBC's other new dramas Heroes and Friday Night Lights which were much better shows.

The show had two major flaws for me.  First, it was supposed to be a comedy sketch show that they were producing but the sketches were awful -- like 1980 or 1986 SNL awful.  I had a hard time believing that Matt's character was the comedic genius that he was supposed to be.

Second, it was incredibly condescending to those Americans who choose not to live on one of the coasts, even when it was trying to show both sides.  The best example for me is when the one actors' (I can't remember his name) parents were visiting from their ""rural"" home -- in Columbus, Ohio!  Excuse me? Rural?  Do you have an atlas? Anyway, while he was giving them a tour of their theatre he mentioned that it was where Abbott & Costello premiered their ""Whose on First?"" sketch and the parents stared at him blankly and said that he was ""assuming we knew who that was"".  Ridiculous!  Not only has probably every Bushman in the Khalahari heard that sketch since he was a five-year-old; Abbott and Costello were the parents' generation!  They're from Ohio, not a cave!  Moronic.

I gave up on the show about halfway through.  Good riddance.  Thank God they had sense enough to give Friday Night Lights another chance, though.  That's a quality show.",1187136000,15,1622,4.48122866894198

I miss this show already; even when I watch the old episodes on my DVR, I am left feeling a little sad knowing that it is not coming back next season. It's a crime. Certainly a show that regularly delivered 8+million viewers until it became evident of its cancellation (6.5+ million for most of the burn-off episodes, plus a million or more on DVR-delay) should still have a place on TV, at least on Showtime or HBO. I know it was expensive, but HBO spent almost as much on ""The Sopranos"" in the later years, and ""S60"" was comparable in viewership. Personally, I absolutely disliked ""The Sopranos"" and everything it represented, but ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" almost always inspired and entertained me. It's all relative: TNT claims a huge success with ""The Closer,"" which delivers about as many viewers as ""S60"" did. And ""S60"" floors it in The Demo (18-49), as well as the Super Demo (wealthy 18-49). As a member of the rare ""religious middle (toward left)"" I found the battles between Matt and Harriet compelling, and the acting, writing, and chemistry were all first-rate. I do appreciate NBC for at least having the sense to run the last few episodes during the summer. Funny though, NBC switched the order of the episodes for the burn-off, running ""The Disaster Show"" first instead of ""Breaking News."" TDS, missing any appearances by Matt, Danny, or Jordan (Perry, Whitford and Peet), was the worst episode of the series, and after watching it I almost bailed on the rest of the episodes. I sure am glad I didn't do that. The remaining episodes were compelling, sticking with more drama and fewer sketches. The show wasn't perfect, but neither is life. It was heavy-handed at times, and a little melodramatic in spots, too. But it was great TV, some of the best in ages.

The only reason I even watched it in the first place was because I left the TV on after Heroes and listened to it as I washed dishes.  As time went on, I found that I would forget to watch Heroes on a regular basis, but would always remember to tune into Studio 60.  I loved the entire cast.  They made such an amazing ensemble - particularly Matthew Perry, whom I had never seen do anything on TV other than ""Friends.""  I was blown away by his performance but truly I loved EVERYONE (well, not so much Sarah Paulson, but I can't tell if it was because her character was obnoxious or if she was obnoxious... I loved her because Matt Albie loved her.)

I will miss this show - I really think it could have gone somewhere if it was given the opportunity to breathe.  It was mis-advertised as a comedy - which it wasn't, there were funny moments, but it wasn't a comedy.

1577845,4,B00005JPI6,"The expectations for Studio 60 were incredibly high, and the shows biggest failure was not being able to meet them.  This was a show about what goes on behind the scenes of a once cutting edge, live skit program, similar to Saturday Night Live.  Studio 60 was one of the smartest and most entertaining shows on television last year with its insider views of life behind the scenes of a television show and a network.

All of the performaces were solid across the board, but Amanda Peet always seemed too hip and young to run a television network, and Bradley Whitford's Danny Tripp seemed interchangable with his West Wing character Josh Lymann.  The show's scripts were able to be funny, nuanced, and dramatic like we would expect from a Sorkin written and created series.  But the skits on the show within a show were often so bland and cringe inducing, you wondered why the pretend show was able to surive.  While the skits were only a minor part of each Studio 60 episode, their failures would often pull you out of the great things occuring within the show.

Sorkin's other two shows, Sports Night and the West Wing, are two of the best shows ever created.  Studio 60 falls very short when held next to them.

1577847,4,B00005JPI6,"While I can't argue with those who point out the flaws in the show (there were many) it deserved better than NBC gave it. It had it's time slot shuffled late in the season, was put on hiatus for reality TV and mid-season fare (Black Donnelys), and was never really well promoted (or at least promoted as much as the unfunny ""30 Rock"") after the first few weeks.
 NBC gave up on this show a few weeks in not because of poor reviews, but poor ratings. What network has dropped any criticaly despised reality Tv show if it rates well? The fact is, this was an extremely expensive show with fairly low numbers on a network that is quickly falling into last place among the big four nets.
 But is it any good?

 Absolutely. While they were often given some storylines below Sorkin's talent the cast was top-notch. Perry in particular has never been further from his ""Friends"" Chandler character and that's a good thing. He gave Matt depth in some complex arcs and just the right touch of rebel mixed with a quick wit from Sorkin's pen. His relationship with Harriet grew tiresome after a while, but when it worked in the early episodes it was great. Their polar-opposite debates on politics and religion gave Sorkin a soapbox that bothered some, but made for well thought arguments that were more even handed than most give credit for.
 Even more interesting was the dualing banjo dialogue with Matt and his partner in crime Danny (Bradley Whitford). There is real chemistry in the scenes between them, as they take control of their dream show and wrestle with the executives Jordan (Amanda Peet) and Jack (Steven Webber). Both Webber and Pete give career performances here (Webber especially in the 2 part episode with John Goodman).
 Also worth noting is the supporting cast. First and foremost is D.L. Hughley who isn't appreciated by all critics but was a fave of mine for his dramatic turns more than his comedy. Timothy Busfield is great is small doses but is grating in his spotlight episodes, while Mark McKinney of ""Kids in the Hall"" fame is underplayed and a hauntingly tragic character who deserved more story time.
 Quickly, what's bad?

 Repetition, repetition. The Matt/Harriet relationship is driven into the ground and is less interesting evertime it's mentioned. Sorkin has this problem with a few storylines he can't seem to resolve so he just revisits them to death, or takes too long to finish them (missing snake). I was also quite suprised after a few episodes to see some truly tired premises find their way into the show. Stuck on a roof? Please! How many sitcoms have used that tired stuck in a safe/freezer/roof/etc just to trap two characters into talking out their problems?
 And then there are the sketch comedy moments. It's a Saturday Night Live clone so you have to show the actual sketches but it really helps if you can write them. I don't dislike them as much as some reviewers but there's not much funny there. The Santa ""To Catch a Predator"", Nicholas Cage show and some of Harriet's impressions are good but the fake news segment is painfully bad and the rest are just better left ignored. A good comedy writer on staff just to write these moments would have been a plus.
 In the end it will be missed by many. NBC should have stuck by it and given it more time to succeed. But like ""Drive"" and several other show these days, it had about three weeks to make it and it failed.

That's too bad. It had a heart, a brain and no lack of courage. Here's hoping we can see this cast find gold again on the small or big screen. Sorkin has moved on to film and who can blame him?

But this show was truly awful.

In my experience, people react negatively to negative reviews on Amazon and any Sorkin fan who happened to miss seeing Studio 60 thus far will be inclined to discount this review. But please realize this is NOT one of the cancellation tragedies (critical darlings, cult favorites, excellent shows that never got the ratings they deserved (and needed), such as Arrested Development and Veronica Mars). This show was not just low-rated but pretty much universely critically reviled, in my opinion rightly.

Doing that would have benefitted the network, the audience, maybe even the society (that's a lot of pressure!)

Imperfections included, Studio 60 made me laugh, it made me cry, it literally made me cheer, and it did what Aaron Sorkin's work always does: celebrate the human condition (instead of tearing it down, as many shows do.) Like other Sorkin series, Studio 60 focused on people of good will doing their best to support each other and create something of value. I inevitably felt cleansed when I watched it, and I didn't clear the episodes from my DVR until the DVD was in my mailbox.

As for the DVD, I wish there had been more extras on it than the Pilot commentary, and a mini-documntary made early in the season. It would have been fascinating to hear Mr. Sorkin and his partner Tommy Schlamme have an honest discussion of the strengths and weaknesses, successes and demise of this show.

This was a thought-provoking show with great characters and wonderful, witty, fast-paced dialogue.  Matthew Perry shone in his role, as did Bradley Whitford.  Even the Sarah Paulson character, Harriet Hayes, managed to not alienate me, and I came to like the fact that a character like hers was written into the show.

In the past, quality shows with poor ratings, but lots of merit, were given second chances - sometimes even third and fourth chances - but now it appears that it's one strike, you're out.  I think this truly says a lot about the quality of television today, that even a quality show is given 3 months to make it - as Studio 60 was.

I was wrong and am now addicted to this show just like I was for a time to West Wing.  The dialogue is so engaging and smart - why do so many of us turn on TV and tune out when this type of delightful character banter is available for consumption?

1578001,5,B00005JPI6,"It's doomed.

Face it: their vocabulary is above elementary school level, the insider behavior is engaging and believable (except for their fictional ability to actually get smart and witty television on the air) and the historical and theatrical references are simultaneously witty and funny.

I found the visit by a blacklisted writer for Cid Caesar touching, and not even a little preachy (as some critics have accused).  There is an abundance of drama (high and petty) and a paucity (oh, look it up) of slapstick.  They deride the left, the right, the left for deriding the right, the law, the press...  Everything except what every other cheap-shot comic in town is making fun of: Politicians, the daily paper and celebrities gone embarrassingly wild.

So who could watch this show?  The usual sitcom fans would have to, at least once per episode, confess that they ""didn't get that"".  The show is honest, thus immediately alienating the pretentious.  The casual viewer would be lost after missing even one character-development-filled episode.  The dialog is too fast for those on weed, and too subtle for those on meth.

THE GOOD : The writing to my mind is top notch, and lives up the the claim of ""the smartest show on TV"".  Not only are the jokes constantly funny, but they are not of the 6th grade play ground verity that most shows have.  Mathew Perry seems to have found a new niche he is very conferable with in this new character.  The the co-stars, and writing staff come together in a great mix.

Add to that the rants on the show tend to be venting most of the same thoughts many people have been having for years about TV programing, and you have a show that was meant to be loved.

THE BAD :  The show can be condesending at times.  Take the episode where they went on and on ranting about product placement.  Why is that bad you might ask.  The episode was full of product placement.  They rant and rant about how TV should not be so dumbed down for the midwest, and they at times set the intelect level in the basement at times for midwestern characters.  Take the parents of one of the characters who where supposed to have not heard of the famus ""Who's on First"" skit.

1578005,5,B00005JPI6,"With all the pre-fall hoopla going into the debut of STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP, and the rave reviews it had garnered, I couldn't help but tune in that Monday night at 10pm, September 18, 2006. Now, I'm not really familiar with Aaron Sorkin's prior work. I'd certainly heard of SPORTS NIGHT and THE WEST WING and was aware of the plaudits these shows have earned, but, somehow, I haven't had many occasions to consistently view episodes of them. So, going into STUDIO 60, I wasn't really saddled with preconceptions regarding the much touted writer/creator/producer. Actually, what preconceptions I've had were attributed to my being a fan of FRIENDS and of Matthew Perry, in particular, who was my favorite in that much-missed comedy series. The very few episodes of THE WEST WING that I've seen were the ones guest-starring Perry, who, I felt, acquitted himself well dramatically. So I was very curious to see him branch out and take on the predominantly serious role of Matt Albie. But, after having seen the debut episode, my focus rapidly grew to encompass the rest of the excellent cast. Eleven episodes into STUDIO 60 and I must say things are looking bright in terms of the show's quality. Every show has been golden or, at least, silvery. Thus far, my favorite episodes are the ""Pilot,"" ""The Cold Open,"" ""The West Coast Delay,"" ""The Long Lead Story,"" and ""The Christmas Show."" The ratings, however and sad to say, seem to have steadily declined. But, hopefully, NBC knows a good thing when it kicks 'em in the face and will keep this show on air. After all, they're not the FOX network (still miss you, FIREFLY).

For those who care, some SPOILERS follow. The debut episode dealt with the shocking on-air blow-up of Judd Hirsch's character, the executive producer of the live sketch comedy show STUDIO 60. His 53-second tirade (ala Peter Finch's classic explosion from NETWORK) causes him to be summarily sacked and leaves the show and its personnel in shambles. This sucks for Jordan McDeere (Amanda Peet) as this is her first day as the new president of NBS, the network which has Studio 60 as its flagship show. Her first move, a preemptive act against the upcoming public and media outcry, is to immediately hire back the team of writer Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and director/executive producer Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) to ramrod the show. Albie and Tripp, longtime best friends, had been fired from Studio 60 four years before in a cloud of controversy. Initially unwilling,  the duo eventually decides to come back on board and try to save the day and bring the eroded show back to its former glory. The debut and the following episodes go on to reveal a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the crafting of a weekly live sketch comedy show, as well as chronicle the personal lives of everyone involved. Among other things, we get to witness the supposedly now defunct romantic relationship between Matt Albie and the gorgeous and religious cast star Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson), the come-to-light media story of Jordan's auto accident years back - which brings her to undesirable public scrutiny, as well as her ensuing pregnancy, and Danny's drugs-and-drinks past occasionally dredged up, as well as his blossoming feelings for Jordan.

The acting is above par, really excellent. I can't say enough about the chemistry between buddies Matt and Danny. It really seems as if these guys, Perry and Whitford, have known each other for eons, so natural do they bounce off each other. Also, the rapport between Perry and Paulson is pretty palpable. Amanda Peet as the young, take-charge, got-somethin'-to-prove network president does a nice job of being gutsy and cocky yet hinting at vulnerabilites here and there. D.L. Hughley was a surprise acting choice which I think pays off, although he hasn't really done anything here yet. Sarah Paulson as Harriet (supposedly based on Kristin Chenoweth, whom Sorkin dated) is simply marvelous. The sequence in episode 5 ""The Long Lead Story,"" wherein she unveils some personal life stories to a probing reporter  - well, it really showcased some very, very good acting on her part. Paulson unaffectedly exudes qualities of elegant sincerity and humor - and she does a wicked Juliette Lewis impression. I just hope, for however long this series lasts, that the writers take Matt and Harriet's romance seriously. This early in the series, I'm really rooting for them, and never more so than when, over a live Sting performance, Harriet declares to Matt, ""You knock my socks off."" Hey, I may be a guy, but I am susceptible to mushy scenes every now and then. Chances are there could also be something brewing between Danny and Jordan. Time, of course, will tell. And I gotta hand it to Steven Weber. I initially loathed his character, the sneering, eye-strictly-on-the-dollar NBS chairman Jack Rudolph, but, over the past few episodes, have glimpsed a gentler, kinder chairman and have changed my opinion of him to a more favorable one.

This premise is so rife with possibilities. Just imagine the storylines that could be mined. As one possible plot tangent, just think of how crazy and surreal the lives and experiences of the Saturday Night Live cast has been and continues to be. STUDIO 60 can go to so many places here, and, as a bonus, the premise of a show within a show means that you can bring in whichever actor or performer and derive some fun from watching them be themselves, or as much as tv will let them. So, yeah, STUDIO 60, and, come to think of it, its lead-in show HEROES, have become my Monday must-see back-to-backs. Now, the only negative I can think of is that, at times, the humor introduced within the actual live comedy show, Studio 60, isn't all that funny, which undermines the credibility of the characters, in particular, Matt and Danny. So, yes, hopefully, the comedy of the show within the show becomes more consistently chuckle-worthy.

Big ups to Amazon Unbox Video for hooking me up with episode 5 (so upset I'd missed it originally). For a modest $1.99 per episode - and once I got thru the lengthy initial system start up and then waited for almost an hour for the actual episode download - I finally caught ""The Long Lead Story"" - which was worth the wait and the price of admission just for Sarah Paulson's charismatic performance alone.",1161734400,11,6344,4.864014801110083
1578006,3,B00005JPI6,"I am a big fan of most of Aaron Sorkin's work -- Sports Night, The West Wing, A Few Good Men (not so much a fan of The American President, which I felt was almost a trial story arc for The West Wing). That being said, I wish I could be as big a fan of Studio 60. It has great characters and compelling conflicts between them, which are key for any drama. However, I feel Studio 60 falls short on two fronts:

1) It tries to be too important. The pilot essentially opens with how bad television is helping to erode the public discourse, and one of the first story arcs has a reporter cover the show because she feels such television is important to cover. These are valid, debatable points. However, the subject of Studio 60 is sketch comedy, and trying to make Studio 60 ""relevant"" comes off to me as almost pompous and a little too dramatic. Sports Night also analyzed into how its subject matter (journalism, and in particular sports journalism) could be relevant in today's society -- however, it also at several points in the show also noted that sports and sports journalism weren't necessarily the most important things in the world. A similar sense of perspective would be nice in Studio 60.

2) The sketch comedy just isn't that funny. Maybe it's just me -- comedy is very subjective. However, if you're painting Studio 60 as a monumentally important sketch comedy show, it seems to me as if the sketches should be, well, funnier. Aaron Sorkin can be very funny -- I found Sports Night very funny, even if writers on The Family Guy, which I also like, apparently didn't. Still, I wouldn't classify him as a sketch comedian. Mark McKinney (of Kids in the Hall and SNL fame) is a story editor on the show -- still, I think Studio 60 would benefit deeply if there were a few more sketch comedy writers on staff. If one had to compare Studio 60 with the other NBC meta-sketch-comedy show, 30 Rock, written by former SNL head writer Tina Fey, I think it'd be fair to say that 30 Rock was funnier.

Keep in mind that I am reviewing the show about five episodes into the first season. Still, as a Sorkin fan, while I'd call Studio 60 watchable, I wouldn't call it as good as his prior work, nor as good as some other work that's out there.",1161561600,13,2240,4.405797101449275

7941882,4,B00005JPI6,"I'm still convinced this show was sacrified because it premiered during the same season as 30 Rock and NBC just didn't want two series that were so similar on their schedule. 30 Rock had Lorne Michaels behind it, so no matter how powerful Aaron Sorkin may have been, NBC's allegiance was to Lorne. If I recall, the ratings for 30 Rock weren't even that great that first year.  All these years later, I'm still bitter.

Studio 60 had everything we'd come to expect from a Sorkin series -- a great cast, fantastic writing, snappy dialogue and those long one shot takes. Matthew Perry and Bradley Witford had great chemistry and were easily believable as best buddies, and the supporting players held their own among those powerhouse players.  Sometimes I wonder if the series had premiered just a few years later it would have succeeded. The series has held up all these years later and doesn't feel dated at all.

Its as if this show existed to take non-stop shots at adults who believe angels are real, as this makes a person inferior to Sorkins idolatry of intellect. Apparently you cant be intellectual AND believe in God.

The contempt he has for Christians is a theme which runs rampant through the course of this show. Just like the contempt he has for anyone not a Democrat is the theme of The Newsroom. In that fantasyland, Media Matters is a legitimate watchdog agency. Whoo boy!
