3063177,4,B001186Y1Y,"I happen to have met several of the people involved in making this film, though I am not affiliated with them in any way. Just wanted to put that out up front.

This is a low budget movie, and it shows, but if you can handle the special effects (and some of the acting) on classic Star Trek, you will be able to deal with the production limitations of this film.

Designed to be an allegorical tale that has a deeper meaning beneath the surface, this is both entertaining and informative. I've come across a bunch of people who go on about the Lemurians, and many of them come across as crackpots. Somehow, this film avoids that, perhaps because Poke Runyan is so well-versed in the Mysteries he draws on, or perhaps it is the lack of grandiose self-importance in even the evil Draconians - though I can see the David Icke crowd eating it up as proof of their ludicrous theories.

In short, I enjoyed watching this movie, and recommend it to those with an interest in esoteric things - and maybe fans of David Lynch - though it may be tough going for the more materialistic viewer.",1199232000,12,1081,4.422110552763819

3063179,5,B001186Y1Y,"The following review was previously posted here but disappeared for some reason.  Fortunately I had a copy :-)

Disclaimer:
Before my review and in the light of full disclosure, I should point out that I am one of the characters in the movie and that the writer / producer Carroll (Poke) Runyon, has been a friend of mine for 35 years or so.  Having said that, I will attempt to make every effort to be as unbiased as possible anyway.

Commentary:
This movie is a remarkable achievement in my opinion.  It is remarkable because it successfully blends several established epic stories and traditions, as well as several philosophies, into one metaphysical / philosophical story about the good and evil that exists in each of us.  The story centers the idea that there are secret orders in the world today with notable and powerful members that seek to influence world affairs.  Something like what is perceived of the Skull and Bones Society in recent times or of the Free Masons in times past.  Further, by the use of ancient mystical rites they believe they can attune themselves to the Divine, in the case of the good guys, or get in touch with negative and demonic forces for the purpose of power and lust, in the case of the bad guys.

This story therefore concerns two of these societies:  The Draconians who seek materialistic concerns like money, power and ""unendurable pleasure"", and the Lothinians who seek spiritual enlightenment and oneness with the Divine.  The story then goes on to show what happens to those who are friends of William Morgan, the principal character in the story, when he is presented with the unusual and mystical opportunity to decide which path he will follow for the rest of his life:  The path of materialism, power and greed, or the path of spiritualism, enlightenment, wisdom and service to others.  Whatever choice he makes will affect all of his friends and both choices, with its subsequent effects on his friends, is played out in the movie to their conclusion in something of a vision that William Morgan has.

In the end, the enlightenment seeking Lothinians are presented with visions containing a message of wisdom and a warning while at the summit of Mt. Shasta.  Each vision is unique to each person on the mountain, crafted by the Creator to relate to the specific psychology and mindset of the recipient.

On the other hand, the materialistic Dragonians, seeking power and treasure in other dimensions deep within the Earth, each get what they desire most, and in excess of their wildest dreams.  So, which choice will be William Morgan's and thus the fate of his friends?

Some Praise for Cast & Crew:
In addition to the interesting story, the photography, photographic special effects, editing and sound done by Mitch Lieding are first rate.  The mechanical and electrical props done by Doug Carey on a shoestring budget are most excellent and could only have been done by the master that he is.  Most notable of those props by Doug is the Dero ""Stim"" (stimulant) Ray Laser-Light Organ, which was operated by the Dero Princess played by Isabela Shahira in the movie.  In addition there are the professional acting talents of Merrick Hamer, Ed Sitch (pen name Ed Fitch), Christopher Sanders, Emily Trempe, Isabela Shahira and Gregory Jednack (Jednack both directed and played the satanic vampire Zoltan Nodesque), which added a level of quality that you rarely see in productions costing less than tens of millions of dollars.  As for the others in the movie with whom I did not have a chance to work with directly, all I can say that without you and your talents this movie would not have been anywhere near as good as it is.

A little background if I may:
In order to fully appreciate the effort undertaken by the cast, crew and the writer / producer, it must be understood that this was not a Hollywood production in the sense of having millions and millions of dollars to spend.  Hollywood spends more on lipstick for one of its epics than was spent for this entire production.  Never the less this is a first rate, high quality and entertaining movie.  Everything from the writing to the packaging is first rate.  This is so because this effort was not ""just another job"", but a ""labor of love"" by all involved, even though it was mostly a volunteer effort.

Criticisms:
The only real criticism that I have is that the movie moves along pretty fast so you have to pay close attention to each line each actor says, as there is a reason for everything that is said.  This fast pace is necessary because the writer tries to compress several stories, histories and philosophies, like the legends of Lemuria, the Shaver Mystery, mysteries of Mt. Shasta, Enochian Language, J.C. Browns Lost Treasure Map, spiritually and religion, just to name a few, into a single story when any one of these subjects would be quite enough for a single two hour movie.  So you may need to see this more than once to get the full impact.

Suggestions For Viewing:
Because there is so much there and so little time to present it all, to fully understand and more fully enjoy the movie, try to read as much about it as you can to get the idea and the feeling of the film.  Read the product descriptions and postings here on Amazon.com as well as on the ""Beyond Lemuria"" web site here:

beyondlemuria DOT com/

After reading the scrolling text on the above site, be sure to click on the picture of Mt. Shasta to enter the full site or you will miss the most interesting parts of that site.

Also please note that the story line switches between the Lothinians (the good guys) and the Draconians (the bad guys) throughout the story.  Because the events are similar and because both groups are portrayed by the same actors, when a switch is made between the two groups it may not be clear what has happened.  To help remedy this, remember that the Lothinians are all wearing a medallion inscribed with the Unicursal Hexagram, which is the symbol of their order, and are dressed principally in white or otherwise bright colors, which is befitting of the good guys.  Conversely the bad guys are all dressed in black and are all wearing the Dragon symbol around their necks, which is the symbol of their order.

Keeping this in mind helps the understanding, especially during the lecture hall scene where Dr. Roland speaks on The Shaver Mystery and The Secrets of Mt. Shasta. During this scene Dr. Roland begins by talking about The Shaver Mystery and the evil Shaver Dero.  He then answers questions from the bad William Morgan who is wearing the black clothing of the Draconian order.  The order of events continues with a vision that William Morgan has of his inner most desires of power and lust, then moves on to detail the activities of the Draconians during which two mysterious deaths occur.

Then the scene then resets back to Dr. Roland still in the lecture hall, but this time he is discussing The Secrets of Mt. Shasta where William Morgan again has a vision.  But this time he is the good William Morgan dressed in white and he has a beautiful vision in an astral temple wherein he receives the medallion with the symbol of the order of the Lothinians.  The order of events continue on to show the further activities of the Lothinian order during which a spiritual and physical healing occurs.

One can possibly better visualize the events in the story by relating those events to the popularized scientific theory called Quantum Physics.  Part of this theory indicates that an event can contain all possibilities at the same time but that only one of those possibilities will become ""real"" when the event is viewed.  In the case of William Morgan only one of the two event paths become ""real"" when he makes a decision as to which path he is to follow.  Until that decision is made, both paths are ""real"".

In the light of this then, we have William Morgan at a decision point.  As a decision has not yet been made both possibilities which would arise from whichever decision he makes still exist and therefore are occurring simultaneously, but in separate timelines to their conclusion.  William Morgan sees both possibilities in his vision.  To try to show this in the movie, a scene was added where the Lothinians and the Dragonians accidentally run into each other while on the trip to Mt. Shasta during a rest stop in a restaurant parking lot.  They end up parking next to each other as one group arrives and the other is departing.  The event is related in a sort of dj vu venue wherein they see each other and sort of recognize each other, but ultimately dismiss the event.  This event happened because their timelines meet at the same physical location and at the same time, even though they are on different paths.

Also of note is the scene on the Mt. Shasta where each of the Lothinians see a being, or entity, that appears above the Mountain.  This is actually a vision that each are having that is formed by the Creator into that which the viewer most needs or will best relate to.

To further understand some of the subjects in the movie you might want look into The Shaver Mystery and Shaver alphabet, the book ""Dweller on Two Planets"" by Phylos, Enochian and Dr. John Dee, Hermes Trismegistus and Hermeticism and even J. C. Browns Lost Treasure Map. You can find overviews of these and other subjects on Wikipedia as various other sources by Googling them on the web.

Also be sure to review the commentaries by Poke Runyon that are included on the DVD with the movie as well as the enclosed booklet.

The Philosophy of ""Beyond Lemuria"":
The most important thing to remember from the movie is the universal message of the mythical Lothinian Brotherhood, which is one of inclusion rather than exclusion. That message, in essence, is that all roads up the mountain lead to the summit. Though that road may be Christian, Jewish, Islamic or the Mystical, if one is seeking the Divine with love and light, all those roads will lead to the summit - to that God who created you, who also created me. To that God that is within you that is also within me, in equal measure.

""...For if it were not so, I would not have told you."" Said by the Jesus vision in the movie,

And:

""...I must leave you with a warning: Wisdom and immortality are the treasures of enlightenment, but no one else can give you that which is yours to find within yourself. No one else can make the decisions for you. Good and evil are for you alone to define. In Darkness you may find the Light, or beyond the Light you may discover darkness --- for in truth you can't have one without the other. The choice must always be yours.""
Said to William Morgan by Hermes Trismegistus in a vision.

I do hope you enjoy the movie. We had a great time making it. I would also like to say that I enjoyed working with everyone on this project and hope to work with you all sometime again in the future.

Namaste - which means `The God within me salutes the God within you.'

3063184,5,B001186Y1Y,"I have been wanting to see this movie awhile, but based on the trailer I didn't want to buy it outright. It intrigued me but not enough to invest given the low production. I found it online and it is the best low-production movie I have ever seen. The voice acting for example is pretty stiff, but I say that only to say that the story and atmosphere was so cool that it doesn't hinder the film at all. I never once felt like it took away from it. Having all of the actors plays duplicate roles to reinforce the theme of duality was brilliant. I was able to keep up with the pace which I did not think was too fast or confusing though it still seems like it would benefit from multiple viewings to catch all the nuances. While I enjoy the work of Poke Runyon, Lon Milo DuQuette and Paul Clark which gives me a predisposition to understanding the various themes of the movie, I'd be willing to be that if this was remade on a Hollywood production level faithful to the original, it would be received well. This however was made in the way that it was and that is good enough for me. Definitely spreading the word about this one.",1422144000,,1127,4.246511627906977

3063187,5,B001186Y1Y,"Beyond Lemuria is a wonderful campy romp that is filmed in the style of an old 50's sci-fi thriller.  I enjoyed the original version, and the new release has an informative booklet that provides background info about the Shaver Mysteries, the pulp magazines that inspired the plot of this flick.

The storyline veils the esoteric underpinnings of the Magical Western Occult Tradition in an exciting dual-plot of adventurers who are embarking on a quest for things that are hidden to the average person. The seekers are separated into two camps, like an old-time western we have the good guy/bad guy dynamic. The difference is they are not fighting each other, but are fighting for Mastery of their own Personal Power. The good guys have a new-age feel and pursue inner knowledge and enlightenment. The bad guys seek supremacy and dominion over the people of earth.  The plot twist is the good  - pay attention to both stories and you can pick up many philosophical concepts that are utilize in the modern occult world.

I was surprised to see how good of an actor Ed Fitch is. I have seen him at a few Pagan Pride gatherings and was pleased to see what an amazing job he did portraying a fundamentalist TV preacher. While the picture is low-budget and does not have the high-tech film effects that are in current blockbusters, I felt the simplified special effects were fun and got the idea across. They added to the 50's feel of the picture.

3063190,5,B001186Y1Y,"This cult classic was even more enjoyable to watch after it's recent re-release this year. Poke Runyon is the producer / screenwriter of this dream quest through an archetypal landscape of deros, angels, seekers of Truth and Light, and Lemurians both past and present. Add to this list Mt. Shasta, Phylos of Atlantis, Jesus Christ, Hermes Trismegistis, and a Transylvanian vampire, and you've got some idea of the cast of characters in Beyond Lemuria. Well, not exactly!

Each of the main characters has his or her facsimile from another dimension that has temporarily overlapped in time and space. The evil dimensioners wear black and drive a black Hummer, while the seekers of Light dress in white and drive a silver SUV as they both race to mystical Mt. Shasta for very different reasons.

Our heroes in white have been instructed by various seers to ""Go to California and climb Mt. Shasta,"" where they will learn the truth about the ancient civilization called Lemuria. The seekers of evil go to gain power over others by finding their way into a cave vortex. When Runyon's character, Dr. Marion Rowland is asked to explain the difference between Atlanteans and Lemurians, he gives a simple answer: ""The Lemurians were the hippies and the Atlanteans were the yuppies. Can you grok that?""

An added bonus with this DVD is a booklet in which Runyon champions science fiction pulp writer Richard S. Shaver's concept of a multi-dimensional universe called the Simultane. Shaver used this device in a novel divided into three parts, the last being published in Amazing Stories in 1949. It is Runyon's contention that the Simultane was in actuality Shaver's privately held belief about the location of the evil deros he so often wrote about in Amazing Stories.

When not making movies or hosting blogtalkradio's weekly radio show ""The Hermetic Hour,"" Runyon dwells in a few simultaneous dimensions of his own, where he is known as Frater Thabion, the founder and Archimage of the Ordo Templi Astartes, a lodge of Hermetic occultists based in Southern California. His grasp of metaphysics and the Hermetic tradition adds a colorful extra dimension to Beyond Lemuria. Just as impressive are Runyon's hand-built miniature sets seen throughout the film.

That this is a movie produced by a group of California Hermetic Occultists is unique in itself, but that it is heavily influenced by the works of Richard S. Shaver makes for one of the most entertaining offerings of Hollywood since it's first release in 2007.",1400371200,4,2508,5.019230769230769
3063191,5,B001186Y1Y,"Beyond Lemuria was filmed in a strange and supernatural locale that has always been filled with ancient legends of unearthly powers and mythic visitors. The Native Americans viewed Mount Shasta as a holy mountain  the home of the Great Spirit and other far ancient Powers, with stories of both giants and small supernatural folk who were frequently to be encountered there. Also, the Indians were terrified by the huge and ominous caves beneath the desolate lava fields at the base of this imposing old volcano.

In the early twentieth century the writer, mystic, and artist Richard Shaver brought these ancient legends up-to-date with his disquieting depictions of far-prehuman Elder Races and the remnants of archaic civilizations, still possessing great power, to be found in and around Shasta.

This film relates a compelling morality parable, in a modern setting, wherein both the good and the evil aspects of humankind meet at this sacred mountain, and in the awesome caves at its base  each seeking their respective goals and each finding their own respective destinies, as interpreted by the strange Shaver Mysteries at America's Holy Mountain.",1400198400,4,1152,5.244565217391305

My generation and younger grew up watching cartoons and playing video games.  I had never heard of Amazing Stories magazine which inspired the imaginations of young people before a television was in every household and social media demanded our attention every few seconds.  Beyond Lemuria introduced ideas new to me, and piqued my interest in exploring new worlds hidden in the writings of Richard Shaver, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Abraham Merritt, and many others, which in this present time of instant information by way of internet is easily found, IF you know of it's existence.  How many people Google ""Deros"" or ""Simultane""?  These lost words, or lost worlds even, hidden in time and obscurity, are like buried treasures to those who seek imaginal stimulation and inspiration.  This is what Beyond Lemuria is about.

The money spent for this perhaps would be better spent in the collection plate asking for forgiveness. I am not religious. This movie has inherent value the same as today's fiat currency. The value it carries is what the viewer places in it.

OK I admit I am hard on this movie. Perhaps I am prejudiced for a reason. I place little to no value on channeled information. A movies value comes in the entertainment factor. I am what today some would call a spiritually awakened individual. I remember past lives and the history of this world, what value one might put in that I do not know.

All too often providers of this kind of information place too much value in the socioreligious aspect making the events seem fantastical. Understand that humans tend to place extreme metaphysical value in things they do not understand. There is no such thing as deity, there are only beings who may be more advanced spiritually. Consider that anything else attached is mumbo jumbo. The Gods of religious fame were no more than service to self ego based beings with advanced technology or just plain disinformation provided by religious elite suckering the people they so casually call the flock. No different than the financial Elite suckering rest of the population.

What it the purpose of a Wizards cloak? Is it magical? No not at all. It's value lies in the frame of mind the wearer assumes when donned.

For those who have been naysaying this effort, then perhaps you should watch it again with an open mind and heart. One does not have to be ensconced in, or even affiliated with the esoteric world of magic or occultism to enjoy this movie and appreciate the very positive message it delivers in a very entertaining way. I know very little of those studies, but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of filmdom provided by Mr. Runyon and his peers. The sets and costumes were exquisite and beautiful. The tech of the lighting, sound, and cinematography were as good as any you will see in a big budget production. It may be that some people judge the film by the format it was shot in, but in my opinion that is very shallow thinking.

Some of the players may not have been professional actors, but everyone did a great job, and the genuine passion for the project shines through in their performances. This same feel could not have been accomplished with actors who were only doing a ""job"". The overall feel of the message that the film makers were trying to get out is there. You can see it in the symbolism used, in the written and spoken words, and in the tone of the movie. If you came away from the movie with anything other than a general good feeling about life, and of having been entertained by a good story, then maybe the movie does say something to you after all....maybe it's just that you chose the wrong cup in life :)

3063214,5,B001186Y1Y,"""Beyond Lemuria"" is an unique and entrancing film. I will grant that it is a low budget film with some  production value problems; however, this is more than negated by the fact that it is a well informed treatment of  esoteric philosophy and science, as well as a finely crafted homage to the tradition of pulp science fiction. Most movies that deal with esoteric themes such as hermeticism, gnosticism, Kabbalist studies, and alchemy (what Hollywood usually just calls ""magic and the occult"") are created by people who understand none of these philosophies and are only interested in using them as springboards for a thriller plot. In this film, most of the cast and production people are long time students and masters of various esoteric traditions and orders. (I will not name names or reveal orders--you will have to trust me on this.) Because the film is made by true adepts, ""Lemuria"" has an authentic feel about it, as well as an enthusiasm for knowledge and mystery, rare in most films of this genre. Beyond the esoteric level, this film is an excellent post-modern metafiction of its genre and subject. Like the Shaver stories it is based on, the film presents itself as a mixture of documentary and dramatic narrative, fact and imagination, leaving the dividing lines intentionally obscured (or if I may say so, occulted). The film plays off of a science fiction theme that has given us a fascinating body of literature,  including ""Chariots of the Gods"" and Lovecraft's ""The Mountains of Madness."" Poke Runyon, the writer and producer of the film, clearly grew up reading books in this tradition, as well as in the general SF genre, and his love and knowledge of his subject shows in the nuances and the intertextual references that may be missed by the casual viewer, but which will be greatly appreciated by the avid fan of 20th century science fiction. Finally, I must defend the acting against some of the misguided attacks by some of the other reviewers. It's true that, being a low budget production, some of the acting is uneven, but that in itself can be a nostalgic nod to the pulp tradition. Several of the actors, I believe, do an excellent job of conveying heavy expository dialogue convincingly. In part this is due to their deeply personal understanding of the esoteric subject matter--they deliver these lines better than could more experienced actors with no interest in or knowledge of the subject. Also, some of the actors who are required to play two roles, good and evil, do a convincing and interesting job of separating their two selves, in particular, Merrick Hamer, Isabela Shahira, and Christopher Sanders. This film isn't for the kind of audience who thinks ""The Transformers"" is great science fiction, but if anyone out there enjoys authentic science fiction and the exploration of the deep mysteries of our existence, this is the film to see.",1225843200,3,2883,4.903688524590164
3063215,1,B001186Y1Y,"This movie was by far, the worst film I have Ever seen. If I could have given it a minus 5 star rating I would have. The concept of good and evil is played out by a group of four of the worst actors I have also ever seen. The four play the part of good, while clothed all in white. While the same four also play the part of evil while clothed all in black.  There is one part in the movie when the good group drive up in the white SUV and park next to a black SUV with who else but their evil selves. They see each other but never even question ""hey look these four people look just like us!"" There are awful death scenes, again by what has to be some of the worst actors on the planet. One is the death of the good woman by the evil woman, using somekind of orgasmic ray machine. For 5 minutes a group of about ten of us watched as this woman while tied up, and with a light shinning between her legs moaning and yelling out. In what was to be her highly climactic death. I'm telling you, this movie was hideous!!! You couldn't pay any of us who watched the movie that night to ever sit through it again. Not one out the the ten of us have anything good to say about this one.
EDIT:  I am sure that your intent was to present a film that gave thought to the choices we make and the paths we walk. But I stand by my review. The movie was bad and I am glad I didn't waste my money on it. There were 10 of us watching the film at a Spiritual Center. No one walked out, because we gave the film a chance. You are right the universe is a symphony of light and dark, and one can not be without the other. The synopsis may have held an important message. However the script, acting and directing were bad. Sorry the film was very amateurish and screamed B movie. The film didn't go over my head, nor over heads of anyone else who sat and watched your film. A far as stage acting. I would not say that they were good stage actors either. Film and tv work is far different and stage acting does not translate well onto film. It needs to be toned down for film. Even if it is good stage acting. Keep that in mind for your next project. Also keep in mind that as the writer you are aware of the message you wish to reveal through your films. But as the producer you need to look at your product through the eyes of someone who is new to the story you are trying to tell. All of us who watched that night are well aware of the stories surrounding the Lemurians and we had a difficult time watching your film. So think how it would be seen by those who this concept is new. Take care and tell your story with gentle power. Your finished film should be able to reveal your message with impact to be remembered, in a positive way not in a negitive way. Watch your film again and see where you can improve your style and technique with an open mind. Mine was not the only review that spoke of poor acting and directing skills. I have no doubt that you put your heart and soul into this production. There is however a lot of room for improvement. There are many ways to tell a story, I just don't think the story was told in this case. The message gets lost in the poor acting, the over the top poor special effects and just the way the whole project was put together. Sometime less is more and in this case I think your finished product, proves that point. Sometimes a whisper is heard over the scream. It comes down to balance. Don't only listen to those reviews that lift your ego, listen to those reviews that challenge you and move you out of your comfort zone. Your next project may be better because of it.",1223164800,7,3597,4.057665260196906

3063222,4,B001186Y1Y,"Imagine that cult film director Ed Wood was also a ceremonial magician.

Or imagine a merger of Dion Fortune and Elvira: Mistress of the Dark. She would be perfect to introduce this film.

Imagine giant caverns underground filled with degenerate descendants of the Lemurians, accessible from the lower slopes of Mount Shasta.

If you can imagine all that, you should watch Beyond Lemuria.

Written by Poke Runyon, well-known in West Coast Pagan and magickal circles, and including several other veterans of that scene in its cast (as well as some much younger and cuter actresses to balance the mostly mature male cast), the movie was clearly a labor of love, with the director and cast enjoying themselves almost too much.

You can't have an occult thriller without swirling visual vortices or bits of Central European menace: a black magician with a ""broomhandle"" Mauser pistol strapped over his robe, or a sinister Romanian carrying (oddly) the Hungarian name of ""Zoltan."" And black magic must work, because that particular cabal seems not to need California license plates on their black SUV. Evidently they are invisible to the cops.

At the heart of Beyond Lemuria are a 19th-century occult bestseller, A Dweller on Two Planets, by Frederick Spencer Oliver and the ""Shaver Mystery,"" which sustained the sales of the old SF pulp magazine Amazing Stories for years, not to mention being a staple topic in Fate magazine as well.

Anyway, the good guys are all good and seek enlightenment. The bad guys are bad and seek power. ""Other members of the expedition were expendable,"" sneers the chief baddie.

A young initiate must choose between two paths. But evil is never permanently defeated.

You will have to buy it from the filmmakers or from Amazon, because you won't find this occult thriller at Netflix or showing at the local cineplex. But once you own a copy, you can add it to your ""midnight movie"" collection. Think of it as Plan 9 from Inner Space.

This is a low budget movie, and it shows, but if you can handle the special effects (and some of the acting) on classic Star Trek, you will be able to deal with the production limitations of this film.

Designed to be an allegorical tale that has a deeper meaning beneath the surface, this is both entertaining and informative. I've come across a bunch of people who go on about the Lemurians, and many of them come across as crackpots. Somehow, this film avoids that, perhaps because Poke Runyan is so well-versed in the Mysteries he draws on, or perhaps it is the lack of grandiose self-importance in even the evil Draconians - though I can see the David Icke crowd eating it up as proof of their ludicrous theories.

In short, I enjoyed watching this movie, and recommend it to those with an interest in esoteric things - and maybe fans of David Lynch - though it may be tough going for the more materialistic viewer.",1199232000,12,1081,4.422110552763819

3297676,5,B001186Y1Y,"The following review was previously posted here but disappeared for some reason.  Fortunately I had a copy :-)

Disclaimer:
Before my review and in the light of full disclosure, I should point out that I am one of the characters in the movie and that the writer / producer Carroll (Poke) Runyon, has been a friend of mine for 35 years or so.  Having said that, I will attempt to make every effort to be as unbiased as possible anyway.

Commentary:
This movie is a remarkable achievement in my opinion.  It is remarkable because it successfully blends several established epic stories and traditions, as well as several philosophies, into one metaphysical / philosophical story about the good and evil that exists in each of us.  The story centers the idea that there are secret orders in the world today with notable and powerful members that seek to influence world affairs.  Something like what is perceived of the Skull and Bones Society in recent times or of the Free Masons in times past.  Further, by the use of ancient mystical rites they believe they can attune themselves to the Divine, in the case of the good guys, or get in touch with negative and demonic forces for the purpose of power and lust, in the case of the bad guys.

This story therefore concerns two of these societies:  The Draconians who seek materialistic concerns like money, power and ""unendurable pleasure"", and the Lothinians who seek spiritual enlightenment and oneness with the Divine.  The story then goes on to show what happens to those who are friends of William Morgan, the principal character in the story, when he is presented with the unusual and mystical opportunity to decide which path he will follow for the rest of his life:  The path of materialism, power and greed, or the path of spiritualism, enlightenment, wisdom and service to others.  Whatever choice he makes will affect all of his friends and both choices, with its subsequent effects on his friends, is played out in the movie to their conclusion in something of a vision that William Morgan has.

In the end, the enlightenment seeking Lothinians are presented with visions containing a message of wisdom and a warning while at the summit of Mt. Shasta.  Each vision is unique to each person on the mountain, crafted by the Creator to relate to the specific psychology and mindset of the recipient.

On the other hand, the materialistic Dragonians, seeking power and treasure in other dimensions deep within the Earth, each get what they desire most, and in excess of their wildest dreams.  So, which choice will be William Morgan's and thus the fate of his friends?

Some Praise for Cast & Crew:
In addition to the interesting story, the photography, photographic special effects, editing and sound done by Mitch Lieding are first rate.  The mechanical and electrical props done by Doug Carey on a shoestring budget are most excellent and could only have been done by the master that he is.  Most notable of those props by Doug is the Dero ""Stim"" (stimulant) Ray Laser-Light Organ, which was operated by the Dero Princess played by Isabela Shahira in the movie.  In addition there are the professional acting talents of Merrick Hamer, Ed Sitch (pen name Ed Fitch), Christopher Sanders, Emily Trempe, Isabela Shahira and Gregory Jednack (Jednack both directed and played the satanic vampire Zoltan Nodesque), which added a level of quality that you rarely see in productions costing less than tens of millions of dollars.  As for the others in the movie with whom I did not have a chance to work with directly, all I can say that without you and your talents this movie would not have been anywhere near as good as it is.

A little background if I may:
In order to fully appreciate the effort undertaken by the cast, crew and the writer / producer, it must be understood that this was not a Hollywood production in the sense of having millions and millions of dollars to spend.  Hollywood spends more on lipstick for one of its epics than was spent for this entire production.  Never the less this is a first rate, high quality and entertaining movie.  Everything from the writing to the packaging is first rate.  This is so because this effort was not ""just another job"", but a ""labor of love"" by all involved, even though it was mostly a volunteer effort.

Criticisms:
The only real criticism that I have is that the movie moves along pretty fast so you have to pay close attention to each line each actor says, as there is a reason for everything that is said.  This fast pace is necessary because the writer tries to compress several stories, histories and philosophies, like the legends of Lemuria, the Shaver Mystery, mysteries of Mt. Shasta, Enochian Language, J.C. Browns Lost Treasure Map, spiritually and religion, just to name a few, into a single story when any one of these subjects would be quite enough for a single two hour movie.  So you may need to see this more than once to get the full impact.

Suggestions For Viewing:
Because there is so much there and so little time to present it all, to fully understand and more fully enjoy the movie, try to read as much about it as you can to get the idea and the feeling of the film.  Read the product descriptions and postings here on Amazon.com as well as on the ""Beyond Lemuria"" web site here:

beyondlemuria DOT com/

After reading the scrolling text on the above site, be sure to click on the picture of Mt. Shasta to enter the full site or you will miss the most interesting parts of that site.

Also please note that the story line switches between the Lothinians (the good guys) and the Draconians (the bad guys) throughout the story.  Because the events are similar and because both groups are portrayed by the same actors, when a switch is made between the two groups it may not be clear what has happened.  To help remedy this, remember that the Lothinians are all wearing a medallion inscribed with the Unicursal Hexagram, which is the symbol of their order, and are dressed principally in white or otherwise bright colors, which is befitting of the good guys.  Conversely the bad guys are all dressed in black and are all wearing the Dragon symbol around their necks, which is the symbol of their order.

Keeping this in mind helps the understanding, especially during the lecture hall scene where Dr. Roland speaks on The Shaver Mystery and The Secrets of Mt. Shasta. During this scene Dr. Roland begins by talking about The Shaver Mystery and the evil Shaver Dero.  He then answers questions from the bad William Morgan who is wearing the black clothing of the Draconian order.  The order of events continues with a vision that William Morgan has of his inner most desires of power and lust, then moves on to detail the activities of the Draconians during which two mysterious deaths occur.

Then the scene then resets back to Dr. Roland still in the lecture hall, but this time he is discussing The Secrets of Mt. Shasta where William Morgan again has a vision.  But this time he is the good William Morgan dressed in white and he has a beautiful vision in an astral temple wherein he receives the medallion with the symbol of the order of the Lothinians.  The order of events continue on to show the further activities of the Lothinian order during which a spiritual and physical healing occurs.

One can possibly better visualize the events in the story by relating those events to the popularized scientific theory called Quantum Physics.  Part of this theory indicates that an event can contain all possibilities at the same time but that only one of those possibilities will become ""real"" when the event is viewed.  In the case of William Morgan only one of the two event paths become ""real"" when he makes a decision as to which path he is to follow.  Until that decision is made, both paths are ""real"".

In the light of this then, we have William Morgan at a decision point.  As a decision has not yet been made both possibilities which would arise from whichever decision he makes still exist and therefore are occurring simultaneously, but in separate timelines to their conclusion.  William Morgan sees both possibilities in his vision.  To try to show this in the movie, a scene was added where the Lothinians and the Dragonians accidentally run into each other while on the trip to Mt. Shasta during a rest stop in a restaurant parking lot.  They end up parking next to each other as one group arrives and the other is departing.  The event is related in a sort of dj vu venue wherein they see each other and sort of recognize each other, but ultimately dismiss the event.  This event happened because their timelines meet at the same physical location and at the same time, even though they are on different paths.

Also of note is the scene on the Mt. Shasta where each of the Lothinians see a being, or entity, that appears above the Mountain.  This is actually a vision that each are having that is formed by the Creator into that which the viewer most needs or will best relate to.

To further understand some of the subjects in the movie you might want look into The Shaver Mystery and Shaver alphabet, the book ""Dweller on Two Planets"" by Phylos, Enochian and Dr. John Dee, Hermes Trismegistus and Hermeticism and even J. C. Browns Lost Treasure Map. You can find overviews of these and other subjects on Wikipedia as various other sources by Googling them on the web.

Also be sure to review the commentaries by Poke Runyon that are included on the DVD with the movie as well as the enclosed booklet.

The Philosophy of ""Beyond Lemuria"":
The most important thing to remember from the movie is the universal message of the mythical Lothinian Brotherhood, which is one of inclusion rather than exclusion. That message, in essence, is that all roads up the mountain lead to the summit. Though that road may be Christian, Jewish, Islamic or the Mystical, if one is seeking the Divine with love and light, all those roads will lead to the summit - to that God who created you, who also created me. To that God that is within you that is also within me, in equal measure.

""...For if it were not so, I would not have told you."" Said by the Jesus vision in the movie,

And:

""...I must leave you with a warning: Wisdom and immortality are the treasures of enlightenment, but no one else can give you that which is yours to find within yourself. No one else can make the decisions for you. Good and evil are for you alone to define. In Darkness you may find the Light, or beyond the Light you may discover darkness --- for in truth you can't have one without the other. The choice must always be yours.""
Said to William Morgan by Hermes Trismegistus in a vision.

I do hope you enjoy the movie. We had a great time making it. I would also like to say that I enjoyed working with everyone on this project and hope to work with you all sometime again in the future.

Namaste - which means `The God within me salutes the God within you.'

I found it online and it is the best low-production movie I have ever seen. The voice acting for example is pretty stiff, but I say that only to say that the story and atmosphere was so cool that it doesn't hinder the film at all. I never once felt like it took away from it. Having all of the actors plays duplicate roles to reinforce the theme of duality was brilliant. I was able to keep up with the pace which I did not think was too fast or confusing though it still seems like it would benefit from multiple viewings to catch all the nuances.

3297684,5,B001186Y1Y,"Beyond Lemuria is a wonderful campy romp that is filmed in the style of an old 50's sci-fi thriller.  I enjoyed the original version, and the new release has an informative booklet that provides background info about the Shaver Mysteries, the pulp magazines that inspired the plot of this flick.

The storyline veils the esoteric underpinnings of the Magical Western Occult Tradition in an exciting dual-plot of adventurers who are embarking on a quest for things that are hidden to the average person. The seekers are separated into two camps, like an old-time western we have the good guy/bad guy dynamic. The difference is they are not fighting each other, but are fighting for Mastery of their own Personal Power. The good guys have a new-age feel and pursue inner knowledge and enlightenment. The bad guys seek supremacy and dominion over the people of earth.  The plot twist is the good  - pay attention to both stories and you can pick up many philosophical concepts that are utilize in the modern occult world.

I was surprised to see how good of an actor Ed Fitch is. I have seen him at a few Pagan Pride gatherings and was pleased to see what an amazing job he did portraying a fundamentalist TV preacher. While the picture is low-budget and does not have the high-tech film effects that are in current blockbusters, I felt the simplified special effects were fun and got the idea across.

3297687,5,B001186Y1Y,"This cult classic was even more enjoyable to watch after it's recent re-release this year. Poke Runyon is the producer / screenwriter of this dream quest through an archetypal landscape of deros, angels, seekers of Truth and Light, and Lemurians both past and present. Add to this list Mt. Shasta, Phylos of Atlantis, Jesus Christ, Hermes Trismegistis, and a Transylvanian vampire, and you've got some idea of the cast of characters in Beyond Lemuria. Well, not exactly!

Each of the main characters has his or her facsimile from another dimension that has temporarily overlapped in time and space. The evil dimensioners wear black and drive a black Hummer, while the seekers of Light dress in white and drive a silver SUV as they both race to mystical Mt. Shasta for very different reasons.

Our heroes in white have been instructed by various seers to ""Go to California and climb Mt. Shasta,"" where they will learn the truth about the ancient civilization called Lemuria. The seekers of evil go to gain power over others by finding their way into a cave vortex. When Runyon's character, Dr. Marion Rowland is asked to explain the difference between Atlanteans and Lemurians, he gives a simple answer: ""The Lemurians were the hippies and the Atlanteans were the yuppies. Can you grok that?""

An added bonus with this DVD is a booklet in which Runyon champions science fiction pulp writer Richard S. Shaver's concept of a multi-dimensional universe called the Simultane. Shaver used this device in a novel divided into three parts, the last being published in Amazing Stories in 1949. It is Runyon's contention that the Simultane was in actuality Shaver's privately held belief about the location of the evil deros he so often wrote about in Amazing Stories.

When not making movies or hosting blogtalkradio's weekly radio show ""The Hermetic Hour,"" Runyon dwells in a few simultaneous dimensions of his own, where he is known as Frater Thabion, the founder and Archimage of the Ordo Templi Astartes, a lodge of Hermetic occultists based in Southern California. His grasp of metaphysics and the Hermetic tradition adds a colorful extra dimension to Beyond Lemuria. Just as impressive are Runyon's hand-built miniature sets seen throughout the film.

That this is a movie produced by a group of California Hermetic Occultists is unique in itself, but that it is heavily influenced by the works of Richard S. Shaver makes for one of the most entertaining offerings of Hollywood since it's first release in 2007.",1400371200,4,2508,5.019230769230769
3297688,5,B001186Y1Y,"Beyond Lemuria was filmed in a strange and supernatural locale that has always been filled with ancient legends of unearthly powers and mythic visitors. The Native Americans viewed Mount Shasta as a holy mountain  the home of the Great Spirit and other far ancient Powers, with stories of both giants and small supernatural folk who were frequently to be encountered there. Also, the Indians were terrified by the huge and ominous caves beneath the desolate lava fields at the base of this imposing old volcano.

In the early twentieth century the writer, mystic, and artist Richard Shaver brought these ancient legends up-to-date with his disquieting depictions of far-prehuman Elder Races and the remnants of archaic civilizations, still possessing great power, to be found in and around Shasta.

This film relates a compelling morality parable, in a modern setting, wherein both the good and the evil aspects of humankind meet at this sacred mountain, and in the awesome caves at its base  each seeking their respective goals and each finding their own respective destinies, as interpreted by the strange Shaver Mysteries at America's Holy Mountain.",1400198400,4,1152,5.244565217391305

I had never heard of Amazing Stories magazine which inspired the imaginations of young people before a television was in every household and social media demanded our attention every few seconds.  Beyond Lemuria introduced ideas new to me, and piqued my interest in exploring new worlds hidden in the writings of Richard Shaver, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Abraham Merritt, and many others, which in this present time of instant information by way of internet is easily found, IF you know of it's existence.  How many people Google ""Deros"" or ""Simultane""?  These lost words, or lost worlds even, hidden in time and obscurity, are like buried treasures to those who seek imaginal stimulation and inspiration.  This is what Beyond Lemuria is about.  It's the filmmakers loving these worlds so much, which were erected and immortalized in the language written by beautiful minds, that they wanted inspire you, after seeing the film, to turn off Facebook for an hour, to go back, read a book, and Remember Lemuria.",1397606400,6,1225,5.125628140703518

3297702,5,B001186Y1Y,"Beyond Lemuria is a wonderful campy romp through the esoteric underpinnings of the Magical Western Occult Tradition.  This flick is filmed in the style of an old 40's or 50's sci-fi thriller and has the excitement of people who are embarking on a quest for things that are hidden to the average person.  The seekers are separated in to two camps, like an old-time western we have the good guys that wear white and the bad guys that wear black.  The difference is they are not fighting each other, but are developing their own personal power.  The good guys have a new-age feel and pursue inner knowledge and enlightenment.  The bad guys seek supremacy and dominion over the people of earth.

The plot twist is the good/bad guys are played by the same actors, to intimate their stories are reflections of the two paths that can be pursued.  The main character is the only one who is presented as someone who is at the crossroads and is in the process of needing to make a choice of which path to blaze.  By following both his stories one can pick up many philosophical concepts that are utilize in the modern occult world.

I was surprised to see how good of an actor Ed Fitch is.  I have seen him at a few Pagan Pride gatherings and was pleased to see what an amazing job he did portraying a fundamentalist TV preacher.  While the picture is low-budget and does not have the high-tech film effects that are in current blockbusters, I felt the simplified special effects were fun and got the idea across.  They added to the 50's feel of the picture.  I give a big ""Bravo"" to Poke Runyon and Company for taking on this project and I enjoy sharing the movie with my friends.",1341619200,,1671,4.457236842105263

The money spent for this perhaps would be better spent in the collection plate asking for forgiveness. I am not religious. This movie has inherent value the same as today's fiat currency. The value it carries is what the viewer places in it.

OK I admit I am hard on this movie. Perhaps I am prejudiced for a reason. I place little to no value on channeled information. A movies value comes in the entertainment factor. I am what today some would call a spiritually awakened individual. I remember past lives and the history of this world, what value one might put in that I do not know.

All too often providers of this kind of information place too much value in the socioreligious aspect making the events seem fantastical. Understand that humans tend to place extreme metaphysical value in things they do not understand. There is no such thing as deity, there are only beings who may be more advanced spiritually. Consider that anything else attached is mumbo jumbo. The Gods of religious fame were no more than service to self ego based beings with advanced technology or just plain disinformation provided by religious elite suckering the people they so casually call the flock. No different than the financial Elite suckering rest of the population.

What it the purpose of a Wizards cloak? Is it magical? No not at all. It's value lies in the frame of mind the wearer assumes when donned.

Religion takes the natural and makes it fantastical to sell it to the uneducated and unsuspecting as something godly. Nothing would happen without the Creator yet the phantasmagorical trimmings that religion places on things is just disinformation used to control the flock.",1328832000,,1749,4.781456953642384

3297705,3,B001186Y1Y,"Beyond Lemuria is an underground film (literally!) that is unique in American film-making. At rare moments in the film we are shown that even amateurs, with deep devotion, can bring a gleaming gilding to the craft of acting. Guest stars Paul A. Clark and Lon Milo DuQuette, especially, stand out for their excellence;  Merrick Hamer uses to advantage  his gift for reverent invocation; and Lemurian priestess Isabela Shahira openly displayed gifts that must be viewed to be appreciated.

Beyond its form, ""Beyond Lemuria"" is right on-target with its core message regarding the choice, ever before the spiritual aspirant, between light and darkness.  It doesn't shy from ""entering the darkness, that we may attain the light."" For this vision (and for setting the film against the beauty of Mt. Shasta), film-maker Poke Runyon deserves our praise.

For those who have been naysaying this effort, then perhaps you should watch it again with an open mind and heart. One does not have to be ensconced in, or even affiliated with the esoteric world of magic or occultism to enjoy this movie and appreciate the very positive message it delivers in a very entertaining way. I know very little of those studies, but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of filmdom provided by Mr. Runyon and his peers. The sets and costumes were exquisite and beautiful. The tech of the lighting, sound, and cinematography were as good as any you will see in a big budget production. It may be that some people judge the film by the format it was shot in, but in my opinion that is very shallow thinking.

Some of the players may not have been professional actors, but everyone did a great job, and the genuine passion for the project shines through in their performances. This same feel could not have been accomplished with actors who were only doing a ""job"". The overall feel of the message that the film makers were trying to get out is there. You can see it in the symbolism used, in the written and spoken words, and in the tone of the movie. If you came away from the movie with anything other than a general good feeling about life, and of having been entertained by a good story, then maybe the movie does say something to you after all....maybe it's just that you chose the wrong cup in life :)

3297711,5,B001186Y1Y,"""Beyond Lemuria"" is an unique and entrancing film. I will grant that it is a low budget film with some  production value problems; however, this is more than negated by the fact that it is a well informed treatment of  esoteric philosophy and science, as well as a finely crafted homage to the tradition of pulp science fiction. Most movies that deal with esoteric themes such as hermeticism, gnosticism, Kabbalist studies, and alchemy (what Hollywood usually just calls ""magic and the occult"") are created by people who understand none of these philosophies and are only interested in using them as springboards for a thriller plot. In this film, most of the cast and production people are long time students and masters of various esoteric traditions and orders. (I will not name names or reveal orders--you will have to trust me on this.) Because the film is made by true adepts, ""Lemuria"" has an authentic feel about it, as well as an enthusiasm for knowledge and mystery, rare in most films of this genre. Beyond the esoteric level, this film is an excellent post-modern metafiction of its genre and subject. Like the Shaver stories it is based on, the film presents itself as a mixture of documentary and dramatic narrative, fact and imagination, leaving the dividing lines intentionally obscured (or if I may say so, occulted). The film plays off of a science fiction theme that has given us a fascinating body of literature,  including ""Chariots of the Gods"" and Lovecraft's ""The Mountains of Madness."" Poke Runyon, the writer and producer of the film, clearly grew up reading books in this tradition, as well as in the general SF genre, and his love and knowledge of his subject shows in the nuances and the intertextual references that may be missed by the casual viewer, but which will be greatly appreciated by the avid fan of 20th century science fiction. Finally, I must defend the acting against some of the misguided attacks by some of the other reviewers. It's true that, being a low budget production, some of the acting is uneven, but that in itself can be a nostalgic nod to the pulp tradition. Several of the actors, I believe, do an excellent job of conveying heavy expository dialogue convincingly. In part this is due to their deeply personal understanding of the esoteric subject matter--they deliver these lines better than could more experienced actors with no interest in or knowledge of the subject. Also, some of the actors who are required to play two roles, good and evil, do a convincing and interesting job of separating their two selves, in particular, Merrick Hamer, Isabela Shahira, and Christopher Sanders. This film isn't for the kind of audience who thinks ""The Transformers"" is great science fiction, but if anyone out there enjoys authentic science fiction and the exploration of the deep mysteries of our existence, this is the film to see.",1225843200,3,2883,4.903688524590164
3297712,1,B001186Y1Y,"This movie was by far, the worst film I have Ever seen. If I could have given it a minus 5 star rating I would have. The concept of good and evil is played out by a group of four of the worst actors I have also ever seen. The four play the part of good, while clothed all in white. While the same four also play the part of evil while clothed all in black.  There is one part in the movie when the good group drive up in the white SUV and park next to a black SUV with who else but their evil selves. They see each other but never even question ""hey look these four people look just like us!"" There are awful death scenes, again by what has to be some of the worst actors on the planet. One is the death of the good woman by the evil woman, using somekind of orgasmic ray machine. For 5 minutes a group of about ten of us watched as this woman while tied up, and with a light shinning between her legs moaning and yelling out. In what was to be her highly climactic death. I'm telling you, this movie was hideous!!! You couldn't pay any of us who watched the movie that night to ever sit through it again. Not one out the the ten of us have anything good to say about this one.
EDIT:  I am sure that your intent was to present a film that gave thought to the choices we make and the paths we walk. But I stand by my review. The movie was bad and I am glad I didn't waste my money on it. There were 10 of us watching the film at a Spiritual Center. No one walked out, because we gave the film a chance. You are right the universe is a symphony of light and dark, and one can not be without the other. The synopsis may have held an important message. However the script, acting and directing were bad. Sorry the film was very amateurish and screamed B movie. The film didn't go over my head, nor over heads of anyone else who sat and watched your film. A far as stage acting. I would not say that they were good stage actors either. Film and tv work is far different and stage acting does not translate well onto film. It needs to be toned down for film. Even if it is good stage acting. Keep that in mind for your next project. Also keep in mind that as the writer you are aware of the message you wish to reveal through your films. But as the producer you need to look at your product through the eyes of someone who is new to the story you are trying to tell. All of us who watched that night are well aware of the stories surrounding the Lemurians and we had a difficult time watching your film. So think how it would be seen by those who this concept is new. Take care and tell your story with gentle power. Your finished film should be able to reveal your message with impact to be remembered, in a positive way not in a negitive way. Watch your film again and see where you can improve your style and technique with an open mind. Mine was not the only review that spoke of poor acting and directing skills. I have no doubt that you put your heart and soul into this production. There is however a lot of room for improvement. There are many ways to tell a story, I just don't think the story was told in this case. The message gets lost in the poor acting, the over the top poor special effects and just the way the whole project was put together. Sometime less is more and in this case I think your finished product, proves that point. Sometimes a whisper is heard over the scream. It comes down to balance. Don't only listen to those reviews that lift your ego, listen to those reviews that challenge you and move you out of your comfort zone. Your next project may be better because of it.",1223164800,7,3597,4.057665260196906

Or imagine a merger of Dion Fortune and Elvira: Mistress of the Dark. She would be perfect to introduce this film.

Imagine giant caverns underground filled with degenerate descendants of the Lemurians, accessible from the lower slopes of Mount Shasta.

If you can imagine all that, you should watch Beyond Lemuria.

Written by Poke Runyon, well-known in West Coast Pagan and magickal circles, and including several other veterans of that scene in its cast (as well as some much younger and cuter actresses to balance the mostly mature male cast), the movie was clearly a labor of love, with the director and cast enjoying themselves almost too much.

You can't have an occult thriller without swirling visual vortices or bits of Central European menace: a black magician with a ""broomhandle"" Mauser pistol strapped over his robe, or a sinister Romanian carrying (oddly) the Hungarian name of ""Zoltan."" And black magic must work, because that particular cabal seems not to need California license plates on their black SUV. Evidently they are invisible to the cops.

At the heart of Beyond Lemuria are a 19th-century occult bestseller, A Dweller on Two Planets, by Frederick Spencer Oliver and the ""Shaver Mystery,"" which sustained the sales of the old SF pulp magazine Amazing Stories for years, not to mention being a staple topic in Fate magazine as well.

Anyway, the good guys are all good and seek enlightenment. The bad guys are bad and seek power. ""Other members of the expedition were expendable,"" sneers the chief baddie.

A young initiate must choose between two paths. But evil is never permanently defeated.

You will have to buy it from the filmmakers or from Amazon, because you won't find this occult thriller at Netflix or showing at the local cineplex. But once you own a copy, you can add it to your ""midnight movie"" collection. Think of it as Plan 9 from Inner Space.

8240932,3,B001186Y1Y,"SYNOPSIS (Courtesy of IMBD; brackets mine):
Beyond Lemuria is an allegory of good and evil intentions. Two groups of mystic seekers are played by the same actors [almost like a dopple-ganger or parallel reality thing?]. The sinister ""Draconians"" [very original] search for ancient super-scientific secrets of power in the caverns of Mt. Shasta, while their counterparts, the ""Lothinians"" [phew] seek spiritual enlightenment by climbing America's holy mountain [who knew?]. Both groups find what they are seeking and get what they deserve. [I certainly did].

At the very beginning of the film, there is a ""disclaimer"" which is totally unnecessary, if not laughable. Then there is a little jaunt to faraway Nan Madol, to show a remnant of long lost ancient Lemuria (I think?). Next we are watching a classroom lecture and some grad student initiate (into what?) do his bad acting routine as the ephemeral plotline unfolds. We are subsequently introduced to such enlightened characters as;
- Master Phylos (who wears the Egyptian 'Nemis'  headdress for some odd reason, probably because he has one?); he appears to be the aging patriarch of some spiritual sect?
- Sister Lilith, an attractive gal (all of the women in this have nice figures and are much younger than all the male participants save the student guy). The young lady shares a name with an ancient goddess or demon (take your pick) depicted in a Sumerian Bas-relief with bird-talon feet, wings, and a homely mug, who now goes by the moniker of ""Queen of the Night,"" and as such has variously been identified as Astarte, Ishtar, Inanna and 'LILITH,' who biblical mythos identifies as Adam's first wife (she apparently flew the coop?). Oddly this Bas-relief is hanging on the wall in the scene where we are introduced to the present and much prettier Lilith? (Where does one get a fake bas-relief like that?).
- That's just some of the strangeness; this film is ""chock-a-block"" filled with iconic ancient symbolism from many cultures, in a 'mix-and-match' milieu of nonsensical importance.
- We are then introduced to some ""Zoltan"" guy (I can't make this up) who has a foreign, maybe eastern European accent? About halfway through this 'tour de force' the viewer is introduced to a nefarious televangelist dude who is doing his best (worst?) to channel Adolf Hitler (with obvious symbolic overtones echoing the Nazi party); who the ""good guys"" are going to somehow convert 'on the holy mountain' etc.
We see a vision of ""Master"" Jesus (what I assumed was the worst portrayal of the 'J' man ever; turned out to be Hermes Trismegistus? My bad!) whose image is shown hovering over the mountain as he's spouting some drivel about something or other; its almost shameful and might be considered blasphemous by true believers.
- Inside the mountain, government operatives are preparing to blow up the entrance to some ancient Lemurian underground cavern, here we find a scantily clad and not unattractive Lemurian princess who for some unexplained reason has the lovely Lilith chained to a rock? Then things get real interesting (if not a little 'soft porn-like'). The scantily clad 'hot' Lemurian princess, gets behind her (how can I explain this?), ""crystal powered, orgasma-tron, particle beam weapon"" (clearly a phallic symbol) and points it right at Lilith's nether-region, which then induces what can only be described as a very convincing climax, which unfortunately kills the young lady. Why? I have no idea, but I will admit that it was strangely erotic in a 'pseudo-lesbo' sort of way, and who am I to judge? I'm just not sure what the point was?

This film reeks of ""all that is good and weird, but well intentioned in the cosmos""; all I can say is that it could be destined to become a cult classic for movies made on a budget, with an unusual if not somewhat scattered message; Ed Wood would be blown away!

UPDATE:MAR 8, 2015;
Having done a precursory search of the ""Shaver Mystery"" on Wikipedia; I found that it concerns a sci-fi story [written by Richard Shaver and promoted by Ray Palmer] as published in 'Amazing Stories' circa 1947; I have to say that I am further mystified as to why anyone would use this incredulous story as inspiration (or as a back story) for what I can only surmise are belief/paradigms, that resonate some truth to those few individuals ""in-the-know""? My research continues...

NOTE: Mr. Runyon corresponded w/me shortly after I published my original (2-star) review; he took issue with some ill-conceived, if not totally undeserved references I had made; a thoughtless failing on my part. I found Mr. Runyon to be most gracious and understanding in accepting my sincere apology. He even went so far as to send DVD's of ""Beyond Lemuria"" to myself and a dear, aging friend of the family living in Nevada. Thank you Mr. Runyon for your largesse and kindness - you are a good soul!",1425686400,2,4874,4.939024390243903
