3880751,5,B0029SESZY,"We needed a DVD to play in our office, one that would bring peace and productivity to the environment. This DVD did just that. It truly makes your tv appear as a fish thank, with its audio, quality. I selected it because it is clearly the ONLY professionally made HD DVD out there. I liked it because it featured a loop option and the DVD loads the menu immediately. Cool tanks with interesting fish. The only complaint i have is that i felt the live rock tank was a little simple not bad just simple. I highly recommend this product to others.",1246406400,3,544,4.3431372549019605
3880752,5,B0029SESZY,"This DVD is everything I had hoped for and more. The variety of aquariums is fantastic. It gave me some great ideas for my next tank. The colors were so vivid, fantastic. I can't wait for Aquarium DVD Vol 2 to come out. Plasma Candy really hit the bullseye on this one!!!",1246320000,2,271,4.230769230769231
3880753,5,B0029SESZY,"I was a bit overwhelmed when I started looking for an aquarium DVD.  After reading loads of reviews, I actually selected Plasma Candy's because I have their Fireplace DVD and liked the tank images I saw.

My criteria was very specific.  I wanted loads of fish.  I wanted scenes that made my TV look like an aquarium...not like I was chasing fish around the ocean.  In addition, I prefer more natural looking plants and rocks as backgrounds, and I just didn't see that in the screen shots of other aquarium DVDs.

I have one small complaint.  I wish it was in Blu Ray.  However, many of my friends who have seen it said they thought it was HD.  I do have to give 5 stars though, as everyone who has seen it playing on my TV says they love it and ask me where they can get one.",1246233600,28,775,4.1824324324324325
3880754,5,B0029SESZY,"I received this DVD as a gift from a friend who'd enjoyed it so much she wanted to share it with me.  I rarely watch tv so why did I want this but to be polite, I watched it, and watched it, and watched it! The colors were so vivid.  The depth of clarity was amazing,and the huge variety of fish made me feel like I was snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.  Some of the scenes made me energized because the was so much activity while others were so soothing and calming.  The clown fish were so funny and the angel fish were so elegant and very regal looking.  Then there were those slow starfish that moved across the screen without even seeing them move.  The aquariums were so clean and the plants and fish seemed so happy and healthy.  Did you see the yellow angel who was actually smiling?  Five star kudos to the owners and the photographer!",1246147200,,858,4.285714285714286
3880755,5,B0029SESZY,"My kids and I love fish and visit the aquarium all the time.  We have other fish DVDs, but this is the first one that actually got it right.  The fish are nice and close, the don't move around too fast- it is so relaxing. Also, my 3 year old likes this Nemo better than the movie!  Thank you for making a fantastic product.  The picture is super crisp, awesome.

3880756,5,B0029SESZY,"This completely blew my expectations away when I put it in my DVD player and let it play during a cocktail party that I had.  Everyone was asking me where I found something so cool and realistic.  The fact that it is in HD makes all the difference and it created the perfect party ambiance without the hassels of actually taking care of a fish tank.  The colors are bright and vivid, it was like a spectrum exposion in your face!  Thanks and keep me posted when you come out with more!",1245974400,,485,4.239130434782608
3880757,5,B0029SESZY,"The Aquarium DVD exceeded my expectations.  The DVD is so authentic and simply fantastic! I am impressed, and so are many of my friends who have seen it.  What a great product....thank you and keep up the good work.

3880758,5,B0029SESZY,Its nice to turn off the news and turn on the aquarium.  The fish are low maintenance and there's no cleaning the tank!  I would  recommend this dvd.,1490659200,2,149,4.25
3880759,3,B0029SESZY,Too much same thing all through the video over and over needed more scenes,1489363200,,74,4.357142857142857
3880760,4,B0029SESZY,"Nice. Just wish the scenes were wider or bigger, not so close up. But petty and relaxing sounds. Makes me want the real thing again.",1488153600,,132,4.32

3880769,3,B0029SESZY,The video is okay...actually kind of boring.  Not exactly what I expected but not worth sending back!,1472774400,,101,4.9411764705882355

3880772,4,B0029SESZY,Just as described.  I enjoy it with the TV sound muted.  It will not play on either one of my computers.,1470614400,,104,3.9047619047619047

3880774,4,B0029SESZY,"Just okay ... not great. I've seen much nicer,  brighter, prettier videos,
and was expecting something a lot better  based upon all the five star reviews.

Update ~ Altho' most of the videos are really not good,  the Freshwater Angels video is
VERY, VERY nice and it's been  playing continuously for days.  The sound of the pump
is pleasant and subtle, and makes the aquarium seem real. If the other videos  were as good
as the Freshwater Angels, I would give a 5 star rating.",1466121600,,476,4.529411764705882
3880775,5,B0029SESZY,"fantastic,Is there anything that you can not purchase on amazon.full screen feature is great.would recommend it to any one. we have a 65 inch curved uhd tv the fish are great.

3880779,5,B0029SESZY,Great for doctors waiting rooms,1463788800,,31,5.4
3880780,5,B0029SESZY,Amazing!  This DVD is like having an aquarium with none of the work. The picture is so clear and vivid it absolutely looks real. The loop feature is a bonus because it can be set to continuously loop through the entire DVD.,1463529600,7,223,4.309523809523809
3880781,2,B0029SESZY,The sound of the pump takes away from what the DVD is trying to accomplish.,1462665600,,75,4.066666666666666
3880782,1,B0029SESZY,Don't understand all the great reviews on this DVD. Sounded like a dripping faucet with an annoying motor in the background- nothing peaceful about it!! All scenes have the same annoying sound!!! The fish were nice to watch with the sound muted. DVD also pauses at times for no reason. Thanks given to Amazon for the quick refund!!!  Don't waste your money!!!,1461628800,,359,4.790322580645161
3880783,1,B0029SESZY,"Disappointed .... no matter what settings I tried on both the TV and DVD, I could not get a full screen image.  Even the menu screen has the top and bottom letterbox bars.  I have a 32"" TV so it's not like it's a huge set.  Put other ""full screen"" DVDs in and they play full screen.  Everything on the disc and package says full screen but it doesn't show that way with my set.  Not worth the price to send back but can't recommend it either.",1458259200,,442,4.0344827586206895

3880788,2,B0029SESZY,OK but not as I thought it would be.,1451865600,,36,3.111111111111111
3880789,4,B0029SESZY,Better than having to take care of a real tank.,1451779200,,47,3.8

3880791,3,B0029SESZY,I thought there would be more action rather than music in this video.  I got it because my grandson had a good time at the Aquarium.,1443571200,,132,4.076923076923077
3880792,3,B0029SESZY,I SAW THIS PRODUCT ON A FRIENDS TV AND LOVED BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD ON MINE. PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE MY TV HAS AN EDGING ROUND IT BUT IT JUST DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD.,1441756800,,168,3.4473684210526314
3880793,5,B0029SESZY,We used to have a large aquarium in the house so when I saw this playing on a large TV in a coffee shop I thought it would be really fun to have it playing on our large flat screen TV.  This is a great DVD it looks and sounds like a real fish tank.  You can choose which aquarium to play and you can turn the sound up or down.  Guests really get a kick out of seeing the fish swimming in an aquarium on the television.,1437436800,,418,3.727272727272727
3880794,5,B0029SESZY,Just like having a real aquarium in your frontroom.  Even the air bubble sounds are perfect.,1433980800,,92,4.75
3880795,2,B0029SESZY,"I'll keep looking for a GOOD video aquarium.  This one isn't it, too short, too many different tanks with none of them presenting a satisfactory running time.  9 minutes is NOT a video, it's a disappointment.",1433808000,3,208,4.75
3880796,4,B0029SESZY,"The aquarium scenes are absolutely gorgeous! It looks as if the video was taken from real aquariums, not computer-generated like some other videos.

The only issue we have is in the menu it states ""loop all"".... I thought that meant it would show all six aquariums in a bit of a loop, but it just keeps showing the first aquarium.",1433289600,,330,4.5

3880800,4,B0029SESZY,my 6 year old and i love it. he's named all the fish. it's nice to put on in the background. some of the tanks are better than others but overall it is exacly what it claims to be.,1429488000,,180,3.641025641025641

3880805,4,B0029SESZY,"Very Happy with the D.V.D. Plays as it says only thing is that it doesn't play full screen on my television. I rated this an A grade  and for other people this is ideal for entertainment when not watching the set, the other three scenes are different and just as good so they will keep everyone amused,  you can't go wrong with that. The fish are very convincing swimming around and are more natural so what can I say, is only to see for yourself and become a critic and judge with your own opinion. Getting uptight and upset than let this help calm you down as the same as fish tanks do. Other wise just watch and relax to the fish and marvel at their way of life, somewhere we can't go.  Enjoy!",1424736000,,696,4.17910447761194
3880806,5,B0029SESZY,"It's lovely to fill my TV screen with a real life fish tank and have the bubbly tank sounds a a background.

I love it.  It is very calming and looks very nice.

3880810,5,B0029SESZY,great! better than many shows on tv!,1421280000,,36,4.285714285714286
3880811,1,B0029SESZY,"This would be the most perfect aquarium video for your TV except for one thing - the irritating soundtrack! All my other aquarium DVDs have the soothing sounds of gently bubbling water (like a babbling brook where the sound of water is a gentle rushing noise) but this one had some totally aggravating sounds of dripping water combined with some obnoxious tapping noise. I was soooo disappointed to discover that, as I had been really looking forward to viewing beautiful realistic fish tanks (since I can't afford to have a real fish tank). This soundtrack is in every single one of the fish tanks in the video, making this pretty much worthless now >:/ The sounds I am describing are like a dripping sound (like water dripping into a sink or tub of water) and a tapping like water bubble rapidly squirting out of something at the surface of the water. I feel irritate hearing that annoying noise so it doesn't help me feel very relaxed.",1420761600,6,938,4.656626506024097
3880812,5,B0029SESZY,Was given as a gift and the recipient loved it. Had it playing when we went there on Christmas.,1419897600,,95,4.052631578947368
3880813,5,B0029SESZY,"Remember....this is ONLY film of fish swimming around. Period. No plot, no special effects. I've owned aquariums, a big hassle after 5 years. With high quality TV now, would only use THESE types of DVD's for my fish viewing. It is very well produced, vivid, perfectly realistic. I like it for when I have company over, and don't want useless stuff chattering on my TV. Also very relaxing when alone. A lot of these fish DVD's are (apparently) NOT well made. Some Gomer points his video camera at his aquarium for an hour. The reviews on THIS are correct. If you want a very good DVD of fish swimming around, THIS is the one to get. Don't have to feed them, clean it, and they don't die or eat each other, EVER!",1419724800,4,710,4.386363636363637

3880815,5,B0029SESZY,This is an awesome dvd! It's provides a peaceful visual background with realistic filming and sound.  Glad there is not music. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to care for a real aquarium.  I carry this in my travel trailer for an on the road aquarium to enjoy!,1419033600,,272,4.42
3880816,4,B0029SESZY,"The graphics are very nice - the bubbler is very annoying, but I run it with the sound off anyway.  I wish they had one of the five versions to have fewer fish in it.  They are mostly very busy graphics.  But nicely done.",1416700800,,221,3.977272727272727

3880820,1,B0029SESZY,This is not filmed in HD.  I have a 1080P full HD player.  The clarity of this product is horrible.  It looks nothing like the box cover.  I will return this for a refund.,1408320000,3,171,3.9411764705882355
3880821,5,B0029SESZY,Great DVD. Saw this one at my doctor's office and had to have it. Looks just like a real aquarium and I am very impressed.  I have this on when showing my house that is listed for sale. A real eye catching and beautiful DVD.,1406160000,,224,3.977777777777778

3880826,2,B0029SESZY,"There are several fish tanks to choose from, but the stuff that one normally puts in a tank was not attractive to my eye.  They lacked sufficient color variation and appeared to be all rock in several tanks, with no vegetation at all. The tank with the most vegetation was over stuffed with only one kind of vegetation.  The numbers and varieties of fish were also lacking.  The Clown Fish tank, for example never showed me more than two fish, and the angel fish were too few also.  Blah blah blah.

I have several different fishtank DVDs, and the best ones cost me less money than this one.  But if you do buy this product to see for yourself, be aware that there is a restocking fee if you send it back.  This will amount to a couple of cents short of $10.  That plus the cost of return postage (about $4), might not be worth the bother.  Just saying.",1401148800,6,853,4.28125

3880829,3,B0029SESZY,"The choices are many, and the picture clarity is wonderful, but there is a booming sound on all of them that is so distracting that I get irritated instead of comforted by the bubbles and fish.  I visited a couple of friends who have aquariums to see if theirs have the booming noise.  Theirs have a hum that is not distracting.  I'm thinking about returning this DVD.",1394409600,,368,4.462686567164179
3880830,4,B0029SESZY,Very realistic pictures made this charming to watch.  We put this on the DVD player in my son's business and added color and movement to the decor.,1392681600,,147,4.444444444444445

3880832,5,B0029SESZY,"I am really enjoying this one. It looks like a real one and when looped, it keeps your interest. I used to have several real aquariums and now that I am much older and live in an Apt. in the city, I find it impractical and way to much work to maintain a real one. This looks real and sounds real and is lovely on the full screen. I can lie down in the afternoon and drift off for a nap with the soothing sound.",1392422400,,410,3.835294117647059

What is terrible is that an entire batch of these DVDs have a defect in them.  The last one or two fresh water scenes will not be watchable depending on the DVD (and player).  I know this because I returned the product for another, only to get the same problem... BUT WORSE.

This came straight from Amazon, and judging from another comment, this is a manufacture problem.  You can even see it by tilting the disc in the light on the underside.

If that's the case, then the quality control of the manufacturer isn't very good (to say the least). It would cost me more money to send it back to them, and having to pay postage (again) to have it sent to me. So please don't waste your money on this product. Not only that, but the so called tanks it shows have very few fish in them, and the color isn't very vivid at all.

When I first got the video I had to watch it of course, but I don't use it for entertainment, more for ""art"".  Rather than having a big black flat screen TV in the off position, I turn on the video to add movement and color for interest, especially when guests come over.

I have several picture settings on my TV (normal, wide screen, envelope, etc.) and I really don't have the exact setting needed to make this look like a real aquarium.  When a fish swims to the side of the tank, he goes just a little off screen before bouncing back off the glass wall of the actual aquarium.  Nobody will be fooled that this is an aquarium after a couple of seconds anyway, but I would think a videographer would try to make the video frame be exactly the size of the aquarium for realism.  Also, remember that a little fish on a portable TV is still a little fish, but when he's blown up on a 50-inch screen he may look like a 5-pound guppy.

The scenes are colorful and a nice diversion to look at while I'm endlessly on hold at insurance companies.  The water/bubble sounds are soothing in the background.  The scenes authomatically replay so you don't have to keep hitting ""play"" when the scene is done.

It's acceptable, but you'll be disappointed if you are expecting full 1080 resolution, just as I was.  In fact, there's no noticeable difference between playing this DVD through an HDMI cable or a 480 analog component cable.

3880883,5,B0029SESZY,"After a recent trip to the vet's office with our cat- I had to find this DVD. I could not believe how mesmerized my little guy was by this dvd, so much, that his usual anxiety of being examined was non existent. I had to laugh as I've never seen an animal so engrossed in anything on a screen before like this. He kept focused on one little orange striped fish in particular, you could actually watch his eyes follow it~LOL! (what an excellent idea this vet has to keep his patients calm- and at least in our case-worked great!).
I have to admit I find this very relaxing to watch as well. I love aquariums, but honestly have no interest in the upkeep of one. Problem solved here.
You have several selections of ""tanks"" to watch 1. Scenic Saltwater 2. Coral Reef Clownfish 3. Live Rock Saltwater 4. Freshwater Angels and 5. Freshwater Jungle.  You can auto loop through one or do an auto loop of all.  The background sounds of an aquarium are so much better than listening to some new age background music that you find on some dvds, at least for us. I guess it's a matter of preference on that one.

And as for the debate of the quality of the image and whether it's true HD or not- it doesn't matter to me- the footage is beautiful with vivid colors varying with the fish and appears true to life.  This dvd is getting a lot of play time here as I find it very soothing and a much welcomed break from regular TV programming. We had friends stop by today and they were so impressed by  the beautiful tanks and very well done filming that they are now ordering their own dvd. Says a lot right there.

Kudos to PlasmaCandy- I'm interested in seeing what they come up with next. It would be great if they could get some nice footage by something like Cape Neddick (the Nubble Lighthouse) in York, ME. One of my favorite lighthouses and the views are beautiful- with the waves crashing in the background - oh my- that would be so nice!

I have a 32 inch LCD HDTV and The fish look absolutely real. They are the right size and it doesn't loop back the same 6 seconds, you get straight full clips of 6 different tanks, saltwater and freshwater. I cannot take my eyes off of it. So Peaceful.

I found the other reviews on this DVD to be very accurate.  The fish look amazing on a both large and small televisions.  This is important to me because I've seen DVDs where a small tank was filmed and when you watch it on a 50"" plasma the fish look like monsters.  The backgrounds in all cases help make the scenes look very natural.  Other DVDs I checked out seemed to have very plain or no backgrounds and this didn't impress me as much as the live rock or greenery.  My wife and I had friends over during the 4th of July and everyone loved it.  Sure, they could have just been acting polite, but two of them asked me to write down the name and where they could purchase one.  This was very well done.",1250380800,80,860,4.16969696969697

Our children are traveling this summer (by plane and by car) and we are buying a copy for our grandchildren (ages 3 and 5).  They will LOVE it.  Both are huge 'Finding Nemo' fans and the first two aquariums both feature clownfish (their favorite).  I know this will be a welcome treat for them on the plane and in the car.

Our second gift will be to a friend who is bed-ridden with a broken hip.  Television, movies and books require more concentration than he's capable of, but this aquarium DVD will be perfect.  It will give him a chance to watch live fish and be soothed by the aquarium sounds.  The looping feature is perfect -- if he doses off, the dvd just loops.

For the two of us, the aquarium DVD is a perfect way to relax.  We are soothed by the aquarium sounds, mesmerized by the live fish, and impressed by the quality of the photography in general and the DVD specifically.

After about five or ten minutes, I came back through and he was still staring at the fish. He was mesmerized! It must be how active those fish are. What did they put in the water? Anyways, after prying him from the TV, the next morning our son's first question is ""can I watch the fish?""

Excellent content! I would love to see higher quality (e.g. Bluray). But, the HD on the DVD looks great from normal viewing range.",1246492800,,578,4.026086956521739
3880897,5,B0029SESZY,"We experimented with Aquarium DVD Vol. I on our office computers with some impressive results. Both upclose and at a distance, the fish look great and the sounds add a very nice touch for added realism. We're considering a plasma setup for the waiting room in the future and this would be a definite choice. The benefit of beautiful looking and interesting fish without all the maintenance! Excellent release and we're definitely looking forward to the next installments. Way to go Plasma Candy!",1246406400,3,495,4.975903614457831

The kitten is absolutely fascinated.  It actually looks like an aquarium in our living room and so relaxing (Lemmy's humans are enjoying it too :) ) The bubbling sound of the aquarium is relaxing and preferred as opposed  to the new age music of other videos. Video quality is perfect. We have our tv set to vivid on our plasma and the color is perfect in 1080p for a realistic experience.",1524096000,,828,7.418367346938775
