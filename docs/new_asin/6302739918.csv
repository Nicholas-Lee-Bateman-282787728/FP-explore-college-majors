7830400,3,6302739918,"This video starts off at the end of the original series with the destruction of the original Getter Robo. A new menace soon appears and with a new and rebuilt Getter base and a new robot the Getter team now needs a new pilot to operate the third ship.
The story line is a little long in places and one section could have been shortened by 5 minutes and is a little childish in some parts.

My only complaint about it is that we only see two of the three combinations of the Getter Dragon robot. The Third Getter Robo transformation is only shown during the title and end songs.
The leader of the Getter team is a bit of a hot head and during the second show you get the feeling that he was faking being injured.
If you want to see how the Getter team has matured and changed since this series went off the air and in action again with a New Getter Robo, then check out the 4-part video collection called 'Getter Robo: Armageddon'",1016582400,3,929,4.219101123595506
