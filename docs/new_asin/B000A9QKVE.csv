2383441,5,B000A9QKVE,I bought this for my 4 years old daughter and she loves it.  The characters are likeable and enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend this for any little girl.,1202947200,5,157,4.379310344827586
2383442,5,B000A9QKVE,"My girls (4 and 3) LOVE these movies!  They have a great time singing the songs and re-enacting some of the scenes.  I love that I don't have to worry about the content - Strawberry Shortcake and all her friends are very sweet and they even throw in some lessons about sharing, helping each other, and looking on the bright side of things (just to mention a few).",1201046400,10,363,4.323529411764706
2383443,5,B000A9QKVE,"My mother purchased this gift set from Walmart.com for my daughter for about $10 cheaper than it is here.  We already had ""Meet Strawberry Shortcake"".  But even still it was a considerable savings getting the gift pack than getting each movie individually.

My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES Strawberry Shortcake and every movie in this set (Meet Strawberry Shortcake, Best Pets Yet, Adventure on Ice Cream Island, Get Well Adventure, and Spring for Strawberry Shortcake).  The ""re-designed"" little girl is cute, bubbly and always positive.  There's usually a well meaning lesson implanted in each movie that, for now, is lost on my little toddler.  My daughter really likes the songs that are in each movie.  The movies hold her attention intermittenetly (which is the most you can hope for in this age group).  She ends up watching a little bit and playing with her toys, then watching some more.

There are even the strawberry points included with the movies but I did not receive points on every movie, just a few of them.

Overall, I think it's great and, more importantly, my daughter does too!",1141516800,33,1099,4.860215053763441
8076785,1,B000A9QKVE,"This item was not at all what it was represented to be.  I thought I was buying a ""collection"" of Strawberry Shortcake DVD's.  I got one...with two episodes on it and paid $75 for it.  Very disappointed.",1482192000,,203,4.4324324324324325
8076786,4,B000A9QKVE,We have Strawberry Shortcake series on demand from our cable company and my daughter has been asking for those all the time lately. For some reason the half hour episodes are enjoyed more by her and myself. These DVDs are nice but they are stretched out a little bit.,1359676800,,267,4.469387755102041
8076787,5,B000A9QKVE,"THIS IS THE 80'S VERSION! AS I WANTED! READ DESCRIPTIONS BEFORE YOU GIVE SOMETHING A BAD REVIEW BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN IGNORANCE!

Got this for my 2.5 year old little girl. She absolutely LOVES these, especially the Spring one. The colors are wonderful, and the messages are always very appropriate. The songs are actually very good (Jammin'! She sings right along!...no comment if I do or not with her), not even just for a kids show, they will get stuck in your head.

For comparison's sake, we got a DVD of the newer version of Strawberry Shortcake...she's totally uninterested in it. Not at all. Not sure if it's the animation, different styling of the characters or what...but she is not impressed with reimagined SS.",1333065600,2,719,4.790322580645161
8076788,5,B000A9QKVE,"I gave this to my 3 year old niece for Christmas and it was a great ""calming effect"" for all 6 kids during the holidays. All the kids stopped running around and watched these shows- boys and girls both- one after the other. It was certainly a nice distraction from the organized chaos, that is family Christams with little kids!!",1327190400,,329,4.5
8076789,5,B000A9QKVE,I bought this for my 5 and 2 yr old grandkids. They first found Strawberry Shortcake on netflix and there were several episodes that they loved and they are all in this set. My 2 yr old grandson loves Pupcake. He has a stuffed pupcake he sleeps with and the first episode where Strawberry finds pupcake is on here. My 5 yr old granddaughter loves the horses and both of the first Horse stories - Festival of the Fillies and Adventure on Ice Cream Island are on this.  These are a series of shorter episodes not movies which means they are not glued to the TV for hours but a nice break when you are trying to get something done around the house or quiet them down for bed time.,1318118400,3,677,4.207692307692308
8076790,5,B000A9QKVE,My daughter loves strawberry shortcake and this set did not disappoint.  Such a great deal for the price.  The DVD quality is great.  No issues whatsoever.,1294272000,,155,4.884615384615385
8076791,5,B000A9QKVE,"I bought this when it was on a daily deal price.  It is awesome!  My kids love them.  And since it comes with 5 movies, I don't have to see the same one, over and over!",1288828800,,168,3.611111111111111
8076792,5,B000A9QKVE,My niece loves Strawberry Shortcake. So I thought this collection would be a perfect gift for her. I was right. She loves it.,1264291200,,125,4.478260869565218
8076793,5,B000A9QKVE,"This is a great product, you get several dvd's and do not have to go and buy them individually. If your little one has shown interest in strawberry shortcake, this is the way to go.",1258156800,,181,4.2
8076794,5,B000A9QKVE,Strawberry Shortcake adventures! I love that little girl. These stories are good and uplifting. Good product for young girls.,1257465600,,125,5.631578947368421
