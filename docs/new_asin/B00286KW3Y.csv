3872000,1,B00286KW3Y,"I am struck by how many assumptions are made in this presentation. Additionally, it unfairly portrays (and actually dismisses) the message and goals of abstinence based curriculum.

The information is extremely slanted and in my opinion, therefore, lacks integrity. Its premise is misleading. It would be one thing if there was a fair and honest recognition that abstinence based curriculum has merit. I find it insulting that this is dismissed so blatantly.

No matter what approach to sex education a person sides with, the well-being of the young person is desired by those interested in this topic. When determining curriculum and delivery, don't forget about parental rights. Parents...opting out is a cop out. Don't just accept this. The values and opinions of all concerned should be considered before implementing a sex education program.

""Oregon's ""Youth Sexual Health Plan...is just that, a ""plan"", it is not law; rather it is just one method (of many) that could be considered.

Even before viewing this, the picture on the cover leaves out an important element - the rights of parents.  One very important concept that the flag symbolizes is that we have specific rights and responsibilities as United States citizens - this would INCLUDE parents. This presentation gives the viewer the impression that parents are not a big part of the equation. Who decided that?",1305158400,2,1377,5.184684684684685
3872001,5,B00286KW3Y,"A terrific overview of sexuality in American. Every parent, teacher, faith leader, and young adult needs to see this. If we are ever going to get sexually healthy as a nation, then we have to bgin to talk honestly and openly with our children as they grow up.",1302480000,8,259,4.416666666666667
3872002,3,B00286KW3Y,"During the course of his 15 years of research, Dr. Alfred Kinsey interviewed over 18,000 subjects.

As depicted here, the ground-breaking sexologist is himself a deviant who seems to worsen with time.

Interviewing his own overly-pious dad (Lithgow) for a statistical study, 'Prok' (short for Prof. Kinsey) asks about masturbation and learns of his grandfather's cruel abuse because of a son's ""sinful"" behavior. In a shudder-inducing scene near the end, our AC/DC scientist has bloodied himself by mutilating ""little Kinsey"" just to experience what it feels like!

Not for the squeamish or easily offended.

8355842,5,B00286KW3Y,"What a fantastic period piece. I saw this DVD on last week and was very pleased at the movie. I did not think that I would like this film but it turned out to be a movie of great drive. It recreated the 1940s perfectly.

As another reviewer said Americans are very prudish when it comes to sex. They are uncomfortable talking about sex with their children. Even today these issues are quite hidden. Although I find that boys and men are more comfortable with their bodies and sexuality; girls and women are still neurotic about how they feel and are more apt to be jealous of another woman who is more beautiful than she is.

This movie is a loose biography on the life of Kinsey, America's first sexologist. He was a trailblazer, a man who made things easier for followers like Masters & Johnson and Xaviera Hollander and others. Unfortunately his research was cut off in the end by staff members who were uncomfortable with the subject matter.

Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. For its genre I find it to be a Five Star film.

8355846,5,B00286KW3Y,"I am a human sexuality instructor at a college. This was brought to my attention by an adult student with teenagers. He said it changed the way he talks to his kids about sex. I watched it on You Tube (search with ""documentary"" in the name) and then showed it to my class. It's a wonderful look at what a failure American culture is when it comes to educating kids about sex. It contrasts how European parents are more open and more trusting with their children about sexual issues. The result is a staggering difference in rates of pregnancy, STIs and abortion. I've been teaching for years that Americans are NOT open about sex. We're obsessed with it and ashamed of it at the same time. We're like a nation of 14 year-old boys about sex. Sex in America is a dirty joke, not a healthy, natural part of life. This film does a great job of bringing that lesson to life. Watch this with your kids. You will start a conversation that may change lives.",1388707200,,949,4.3977272727272725
