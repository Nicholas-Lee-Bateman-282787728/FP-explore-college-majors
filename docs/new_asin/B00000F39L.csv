7906740,5,B00000F39L,"I just converted the Beta Hi-Fi stereo tape to DVD.  The 1982 concert is wonderful and the audio is about as close to CD quality as you can get.  I have watched this concert twice this week and the showmanship is fantastic.  I can't believe that this was not remastered to a DVD, after DVD's came into existence.  This concert should not be confused with the London concert that she did in 2008 and is on DVD.  The 1982, released in 1983, tape has 23 songs on it.",1406678400,,463,4.215909090909091
7906741,5,B00000F39L,This is Dolly Parton at her best. She was great in her interaction with the audince and put on a great show.,1354147200,,108,3.9545454545454546
7906742,5,B00000F39L,"I was in her band at this time. The last night we filmed this for an HBO special, the IRA called in a bomb scare- when she finished Great Balls of Fire, with all the pyro, the audience jumped- so did we!  Jim Salestrom",1349136000,3,218,3.9545454545454546
7906743,5,B00000F39L,It was way beyond my expectations. An excellent performance from Dolly Parton and from this you understand the brilliance of the lady.,1296950400,,134,5.136363636363637
7906744,5,B00000F39L,"Dolly Parton once told Playboy magazine back in 1978 that she always thought there would one day be a female Elvis Presley. After viewing this marvelous video called ""Dolly In London"", one has to belive that when Dolly made that comment she very well may have been talking about herself. From the moment she steps on the London stage and belts out her disco anthem ""Baby I'm Burnin"" to the closing of ""I Will Always Love You"", the viewer is enthalled by Dolly's magnetism and talent. Not to mention many of the songs she performs here are her own compositions. All her huge hits up until 1983 (which is when the special originally aired on HBO) are performed including ""Coat of Many Colors"", ""Jolene"", ""Here You Come Again"", and ""9 to 5"". Dolly also does a stirring rendition of her classic ""Down From Dover"", backed by a full orchestra. Dolly's version of ""Me and Little Andy"" will bring tears to your eyes and with her male singers Dolly sings ""Do I Ever Cross You Mind"". Before the concert Dolly is shown sightseeing in London, and she takes questions from the British press. Watch as she puts a rude reporter in line when Dolly is asked her opinion of prostitution. Dolly responds by stating, ""why...are you a prostitute?"" Unfortunately, this long-forgotten concert has never seen the light of day on DVD despite public demand for it. Dolly does, however, have a new concert available, also filmed in London, called ""Live From London"" that was filmed at the O2 Arena and that too is a gem. Sit back and see an entertainer in this video that was once the highest paid singer in Vegas back in the 1980's making $250,000 per week. After watching ""Dolly in London"", you'll know she was worth every penny!",1258243200,3,1704,4.645695364238411
7906745,5,B00000F39L,"I THINK I WATCHED THIS CONCERT THE YEAR WE GOT HBO ABOUT 75-80 TIMES.  TO THE POINT I WAS
SAYING ALL THE SOUND BITES WITH DOLLY AS SHE SAID THEM.  I WAS SO DELIGHTED TO FIND THIS ON
AMAZON, AND HAVE YET ANOTHER CHANCE TO WATCH IT AGAIN. DOLLY HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS
AND SO HAS COUNTRY MUSIC.  IT'S NICE TO GO BACK AND REVISIT A TIME WHEN WE ALL THOUGHT DOLLY
WAS THIN, AND VERY GLAMOUROUS, THEN SHE BECAME SUPER THIN AND SUPER GLAMOUROUS, (CHECK OUT
THE COVER OF HER CD ""RAINBOW"") AND BEING IN LONDON IN CONCERT WAS HUGE, NOT TYPICAL. WE ALL
THOUGHT SHE WAS AT HER PEAK THEN, HOW LITTLE DID WE KNOW. SO GRAB A COPY WHILE YOU STILL CAN,
AND SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE MEMORIES.  WHAT FUN!",1246665600,,687,4.066666666666666
7906746,5,B00000F39L,"I have this tape and hoping to find DVD here but no luck (yet!). Anyway I saw only one review so I thought I'd better get in and help! This is Dolly at her best, vocally and visually. Before she got too thin (eat dammit!) before her face was made too tight (ah gravity-who can blame her?) she looked SO good. This is the Dolly equivalence of Elvis's ""Aloha from Hawaii"" he was his best in every way there, and this is THE Dolly to have.

The opening is such fun seeing the Brits flip over her from the airport to the pubs, and puts an obnoxious jealous she-beast reporter in her place when she tried to embarrass her at a press conference. Then Buckingham Palace guards couldn't help but notice her (funny quip). I wish those opening minutes had lasted longer - but it was on to the show. Her version of ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation show"" is great, and ""Down from Dover"" is especially good here too. Then all the favorites like ""Two Doors Down"" and ""Here you come again"". The Brits seem bored but you have to remember they are more reserved there before you get mad at them ;-) Mid way Dolly even does an Elvis impersonation. So good, so good-looking, so Dolly! A must have!",1187481600,,1181,4.368181818181818
