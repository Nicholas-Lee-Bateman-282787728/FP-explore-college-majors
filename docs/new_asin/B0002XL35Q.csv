2136450,4,B0002XL35Q,"Wow.  Got this dvd in the mail from my seller at ebay,and I was more than mildly surprised at the detail involved.

This was the first time,other than the one music video they did,that I've had the chance to hear both the 'sisters Duff'.

Out of the two....I would have to say that 'Crystal' sounded the most like her voice artist.

Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed 'Lucindas' vocal stylist as well,its just been awhile since I heard Haylies voice when it wasn't singing.  It sounds way different here than when she was 'Gina,Sylvia,or Cousin Amy'.  Probably because she's older.

Young kids will eat this up,not literally of course,if they are given a chance to watch it,as it has many characters that will amuse them.

It also has a good story,which helps to make this review easier to use,as a means to recommend it.",1102896000,3,815,4.65034965034965

Tami Horiuchi's description:
Is Christmas a human fantasy about Santa Claus and flying reindeer or is it a celebration of family, kindness, and the genuine desire to help others? When the King and Queen Penguins of Royal Rookery Rock hatch two lovely daughters, an instant rivalry is born between Crystal (Hilary Duff), the first-hatched who is entitled to inherit the throne, and second-hatched Lucinda (Haylie Duff). An unexpected brush with a sleigh bell from Santa's sleigh and a chance encounter with a human book about the legend of Christmas sends Crystal on a journey to the North Pole to find out if Santa really exists. Lucinda follows her and, along a journey fraught with pirates, beasts, and unfriendly elves, the two penguins learn a lot about themselves and the true meaning of Christmas. The question is, will their newfound knowledge be enough to save their Kingdom from the evil plotting of some ""deep thinking"" elderly penguins back home? This 80-minute, CGI-animated presentation offers a cute story with a wholesome Christmas message. (Ages 3 to 7)",1404259200,,2374,5.272486772486772

I wish more people would see it, as it deserves to be enjoyed by a wider audience.  We found it a few years ago when it was on regular TV around the holidays and we recorded it; but we liked it enough we ended up purchasing it (as all our recordings were lost once).

Well worth watching!",1394064000,,390,4.012987012987013
