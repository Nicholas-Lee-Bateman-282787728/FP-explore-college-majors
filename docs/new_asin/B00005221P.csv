1389669,4,B00005221P,"When this first came out, a lot of people I knew didn't want to watch it because they thought it was dumb and just a clone of Pokemon, which was starting to lose its popularity at the time this series came out. But I watched it despite all the bad reviews against it, and I loved it. In fact, I loved it so much that I wrote a fan fiction about it that was almost a carbon-copy of the show. This show has a great storyline, memorable characters, well-written music...everything about it is great.

Yes, I know it's somewhat childish compared to other anime of this caliber, but it's still up to par. If you're new to the anime thing and want to find a good, family-friendly show that everyone can enjoy, you've found it. I recommend it fully.

But like every other great series, it has its flaws. First of all, there are way too many puns used in the series and it seems like the Digi-Destined aren't really taking their quest seriously at first. Even some of the villains are rather cheesy (Etemon is an Elvis-impersonator and Apocalymon makes a comment about his figure).

But despite those flaws, you can enjoy this to the fullest.",1121644800,,1134,4.468599033816425
1389670,5,B00005221P,"I feel digimon is a remarkable animation series and should be brought back to television if you feel it should be brought back to television then please email me on stevenscott3@fsmail.net.

This series starts by 7 kids being sent to the digital world and are teamed up with their own digital partners called digimon. Tai is partners with agumon. Matt with gabumon. T.k(matt's younger bro)with patamon. Joe with gomamon. Mimi with palmon. Sora with biyomon. izzy with tentamon. They have to work toghether to leave the digital world and save it from the evil digimon devimon.",1120867200,,575,4.989583333333333
1389671,5,B00005221P,"Ah, Digimon!  My favorite show growing up!

I will be honest, when the show first popped up, I didn't watch it.  It roused my curiousity, and I very much wanted to watch it.  However, my elder siblings repeatedly told me not to watch it, because it was Anime, and Anime was (apparently) stupid.  And thusly I allowed myself to believe it was so.  However, one day while flipping through the channels, I came across Digimon (the episode I now know is called ""Home Away From Home"").  I was so caught off guard by it, that by the time the episode was over all I could think was ""Whoah...""  It was more intricate than I had been led to believe.  I instantly fell in love with it, and followed it with the intensity of the deranged (lol) afterwards.  I managed to drag my sister into it too, unintentionally of course.  She spotted me watching it, and wondered what the heck I was watching.  On that day, she became as deranged with it as I was.

Seasons three and four were disappointments to me.  Season three was one big crying fest (even though Guilomon(sp?) was so darn cute, to me anyway), and Season Four had lost touch with the friendship between human and Digimon partner.

As for Pokemon... that show doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as Digimon.  Pokemon is, in a word, SAPPY.  Each episode I've seen ends with a WAY too cheesy goodbye, and that really stupid narrator-person.  Seriously, it's an insult to Digimon to be called a copy-cat of Pokemon.

So, Digimon, with its intricate storylines and plots in seasons one and two, and the wonderful characters and personalities, is an outstanding show; a rare gem that the world doesn't see much of anymore.",1108598400,,1680,4.577181208053691
1389672,5,B00005221P,Hey...first of all to anyone who says pokemon is better than digimon....well i don't like u. when i was about 9 years old i started whatching pokemon. then a friend told me about digimon adn i was instantly hooked. Now i'm 14 and still love digimon (but only the first two seasons; 3 and 4 are nothing like the original). But i have a question.  How many episodes does this tape have on it? Does it have every episode? I have been looking for one everywhere and can't find one...help!,1107993600,,484,4.377777777777778
1389673,5,B00005221P,"The biggest common misconception about Digimon is that it's just ""a wannabe of pokemon"". NOT TRUE. Digimon was actually created first. However, pokemon arrived in the USA first. But anyways, onto the review.

Digimon is one of the best kids shows (anime or otherwise) I have ever seen. Adults can enjoy it as much as kids can. One thing Digimon has over pokemon, in my opinion, is that once the Digimon evolve, they aren't permanently in that form, hence, you don't have to lose a favorite character.

The characters, children and digimon alike, have wonderful development. Unlike the 3rd and 4th seasons, the first two connect together. Like the other review, I have to agree that the 3rd and 4th didn't hold my interest at all. The children in season 3 created their own digimon, and the children in season 4 become the digimon themselves.

Seasons 1 and 2 have wonderful interaction between the children and their digimon partners. Digimon is a good way of helping to show some serious issues. A good example is death. Both TK and Ken have to deal with the loss of their partner. And TK and Matt have divorced parents so they don't get to see each other much, and Izzy deals with being adopted, and Sora has a difficult relationship with her mother.

Digimon has wonderful character and plot development. The plot twists and turns, never leaving you dull. One thing leads to another in Digimon. And the music! The songs are lots of fun to listen to and, on occasion, sing along with, lol.

Digimon, at least the first two seasons, is completely awesome and should not be missed! (Feel free to miss seasons 3 and 4 though...)",1106697600,,1627,4.674825174825175

1389675,5,B00005221P,i am a really big digimon fan.  i just wish there were even more digimon dvds out there.  the first season is the best so this dvd is a must have.  it is great that they were able to fit 13 episodes on one dvd.  usually your lucky to find more than four.  no matter what you just have to see this series.,1081209600,,304,3.761904761904762
1389676,5,B00005221P,"First off, Digimon is not a pokemon clone.  Digimon came before pokemon.  Pokemon just made it to America first, because it would make more money (and it worked, did it not?).  Also, Digimon is not a kids show.  It was made to be one by the American censors, but the American vesion has been butchered pretty badly.  Digimon, like most anime, is actually for older teens and adults.  Digimon is actually suppose to be a symbolic piece, touching on the areas of the human mind and soul, the eternal inner struggle between good and evil, the evolution of the human heart, and the qualities most essential to human happiness.  Being as america was not ready for a show of this calibur, animated or not, American dubbers made it into a children's show, so that they could atleast get some money off of the marketing.  The American version is pretty good anyway, and it's really good for kids because it still has a bit of that deeper inspiration to it.  But for anyone who is a real anime fan and wants to see what it's really about, I suggest you find the Japanese import, uncut with English subtitles.  It is really inspirational.",1080432000,,1128,4.567164179104478
1389677,5,B00005221P,"I think this collection is the best Digimon DVD on the market.  With the fourth season of Digimon in progress, you never get to see how the series began anymore.  Now, here are the first 13 episodes of the first season on one disc.  The collection is filled with tons of action packed battles and each of the seven digi-destined children has at least one episode that focuses almost exclusively on him or her, so you get to know the entire cast.  If you have any remote interest in Digimon, this collection is an absolute must.  It covers the series up to and including the battle with Devimon.",1068336000,,594,4.462962962962963
1389678,4,B00005221P,"I'd wish they put more episodes on the DVD, i mean its a dvd. They only put the episodes from the first time the summer camp kids came till the end they saved File Island. I just wished they put the shows in another language like Japanese. The  digi-bloopers were ok, but not funny. FOX made alot of mistakes, even giving this show away was a big mistake. But this DVD is enjoyable to watch. It's good enough for me to hold on. That means I'm keeping mine. But when I got this from a Toys R. Us. store near me (there was only one) it was a lot cheaper.",1049587200,,552,4.0181818181818185
1389679,5,B00005221P,"This has been one of my favorite shows for years. The English dub is actually very good (especially compared to Cardcaptors and Sailor Moon S), and the animation is easy to look at. Digimon is action-filled and contains a lot of funny scenes. There is also such a diverse group of characters that it doesn't get boring. And they manage to explain the technical details in  a way that a child (or a teenager lacking techno-savvy knowledge) can understand. And no, this is not a Pokemon clone--This is a totally different concept. If you're looking for a Pokemon clone, check out Angelic Layer. The dolls in that show fight battles for their masters, much the way that the Pokemon do. The Digimon are sentient, evolved (no joke intended) beings that are capable of living without humans.
This is a wonderful series, and I'm hoping (praying) that the other two parts of Digimon 01 and the second season (Digimon 02) are put on DVD.
Oh, and these voices actors manage to pronounce the names correctly ALL THE TIME. Too bad the same can't be said for the actors who did Cardcaptors. To not even be able to pronounce a simple name like Sakura or Kero...sad.
Anyway, for those of you flamers of Digimon, I suggest you WATCH the show before you condemn it. That is the only way I'll accept your flames. And I HAVE seen the dub and sub versions of Cardcaptors/Card Captor Sakura, and prefer the sub. And Pokemon...I've seen the dub and sub as well, but don't have an opinion.
So, GO WATCH DIGIMON! You might *gasp* even Like it!",1046217600,,1519,4.584558823529412
1389680,5,B00005221P,"When it first came out, I was skeptical.  I did think it was going to be a Pokemon clone as many other type shows were coming out.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Now with the show spanning four seasons (with only the first two connecting), it makes me appreciate more the greatness that is Digimon.  I have to admit that the new seasons just do not live up to my enjoyment of the first two seasons.  I felt it had better flow, better depth, and much better characters.  The whole cast was very likeable and whether that was due to Saban's part in casting great voices or not, I commend them with that.  It is sad to not be able to hear the Japanese counterpart or see it un-edited but it is understandable and I will take what I can get.
More about the show.  The first series starts out with seven kids at a summer camp: Tai (Taichi), Izumi (Izzy), Sora, Jo, Mimi, Matt (Yamato), and his brother TK (Takeru).  Unknownst to them but that was where they would embark on a journey of epic proportions (to be cliche).  They see these lights sparkling in the sky like the aurora borealis and then they get their digivices, mysterious handheld machines that help them with their digimons' evolutions and get transported to the Digital World.  They all land in slightly different places and waiting for them were their own respective Digimon.  They got no time to rest as one mean digimon was there to put pressure on them.  The series goes on with MANY plot twists, new evolutions, and amazing themes of courage and friendship.  It might seem cliche and cheesy but it really touched me and it was all done in a very ingenious way.
What compelled me to write this review was seeing that others shared my view on digimon.  I really hope what people get out of this review is to at least try watching the series.  Rent or borrow this DVD, watch the new episodes on TV on UPN (season 4), which shows some promise.  Though now that it seems that nothing is going on DVD, much less any home release, I feel a need to buy this DVD finally so that I can indulge in the nostalgia once again, .. and actually many times more.",1045526400,,2118,4.38974358974359
1389681,4,B00005221P,"Digimon Season 1 Total Digimon! is a good DVD.  Digimon is a great Anime, for all thoughts that have not seen it.  For all the Digimon fans wondering about what is on the DVD, here is the summary.  It is EXACTLY what was on Fox Kids, with the bad breaks where the commercials would be.  It is the first 13 episodes, in English only.  It also has 8 Digibloopers.  It is a good value, and a good thing for any Digimon fan to have.  Just remember it is EXACTLY what Fox Kids showed.",1044662400,,479,4.086021505376344
1389682,5,B00005221P,"An episode collection WORTH BUYING!  Most Digimon tapes only carry three episodes, but this carries the ENTIRE DEVIMON SAGA!  Along with ""Digi-bloopers"" which were released during the myotismon saga of the first season! Of course, I think they are missing some... (To bad they couldn't do those things for 02...)  If only the snowballmon/snowmanmon commercial was recorded on this thing.  Also, to those who think it is, it is NOT a pokemon clone.
I suggest you get this.  It has the adventure that started the entire Digimon craze, and will most likely never be seen ever again!  And if they ever do start showing these episodes again, It won't be for a VERY long time.
Again, get this!  ...
Now if only they included the two apocolamon episodes, the final fight between the digidestined and the forces of evil.  Or maybe not, because 02 continues from 01.  (03 and 04 do not focus on the digidestined, but tamers and legendary warriors.  Those seasons stink.)
Also, if you like this, you'll most likely love the digimon movie.  Anyways, I hope you buy this, and have fun!",1041724800,,1073,4.745945945945946
1389683,5,B00005221P,"Digimon was one of the most spectacular television shows to hit markets.  It completed three series and is now on a fourth.  However, unlike the Poke' Mon show, Digimon is not about capturing creatures and placing them into battle.  Rather it's about a war between a computer generated Artifical Intelegence which takes the form of DIGIMON or those little Giga-Pets or Tamagachi.  The true magic in Digimon is not the battles themselves, but the adventure leading the Digi-Destined(Children who posses the challenge to save the Digital World and their own world.  It's heart warming and heartbreaking.  In this volume it shows the first 13 episodes, but Digimon didn't heat up until Genai (the wise one).  The children also have a task to become bigger and better people by fullfilling a purpose witten upon their tags and crests.(not in this volume)  My only hope is that they complete the series onto DVD continuing with Etemon, Myotismon, Dark Masters, and the true worth of Digimon Apoclamon.
The theatrical release will seem like a mere show and tell of digimon when you compare it to the original TV series.  I just can't wait until the Digimon 03 series release.  That was the best season there ever was and ever will be.",1037232000,,1228,4.860576923076923
1389684,1,B00005221P,Great a pokemon clone. Which sadly spawned another wave of mon titles.,1023667200,,70,4.916666666666667
1389685,4,B00005221P,"Digimon is a lot better than it looks.
Yes, this is a kids' action/adventure show.  Yes, it features cute, extremely marketable creatures.  Yes, the show can get repetitive after awhile.
It's also drop-dead seriously dramatic at times.  This series deals with really tough issues, and without treating them as the Moral Of Today's Episode (as lampooned so wonderfully by the Animaniacs' ""Wheel of Morality"").  These are issues that aren't solved in one episode, and that cause the kids some serious emotional pain:  divorce, the tough love of a single parent, the soul-balancing comfort of a good friend to talk to.  If you or your child enjoys Digimon, they're watching an above-average show.
Technically, the DVD is pretty well designed.  Artsy DVD menus frustrate me, so I was relieved to see that this DVD features a very straightforward menu system.  You can access any episode, as well as a handful of ""bloopers"" cut together from the show (I laughed out loud at ""Can we just call him Bob?"").  The chapter stops are at the standard places:  Opening theme song, beginning of episode, middle of episode, and ending credits.
This disc also benefits from its raw size; thirteen full half-hour episodes on one disc.  That's over four hours of content, all for a very low price, especially by anime standards (where discs are typically priced at USD $10 per episode).
I can't really think of a reason *not* to buy this disc, unless you're scared that you might actually find yourself enjoying a kid's show.",1012521600,,1506,4.913043478260869

Well, I do and have been watching it since season one on fox. Great story and pretty good drama.
This DVD is great quality. I don't find any video or audio problems with it, but I AM VERY dissappointed that only the 1st 13 episodes are available on (this) DVD. The end of Devimon only marks the beginning of when it gets really cool. and to have it end with the intro of Geni(?) and stop???? Grr.
Oh, almost forgot. When I watched the show on Fox... I seem to recall the ""Digicards"" having a little more info on them, including the digimon names in Katakana... this does not have the same character info.

1389697,5,B00005221P,"I think Pokemon is a great show, but I like Digimon better. I like it better because it's funnier. The jokes maybe cheesy and corny at times, but they do a good job of pulling it off. Pokemon has its laughs, but their jokes aren't the ones that are the laugh-out-loud kind. Although, I think the commercials for Pokemon are a lot better and I really like playing the Pokemon video games.
Pokemon is basically the journey of a boy and his Pikachu. Digimon is he story of how a group of kids with different strengths and weaknesses become friends with the help of their monsters. They learn more about themselves and become better people. Their relationship with their parents also improves too.
I like the characters better. Instead of just Ash, Misty, and Brock all the time helping new-people-that-you- are-probably-only-going-to-meet-once on every episode fighting the same trio of villains (Jessie, James, and Meowth), there are many children all with different personalities. Some are smart, strong, funny, responsible, caring, and sometimes snobbish with all sorts of combinations to form their character. You can also see that the Digimon reflect their partner's personalities. It also has more of a plot. While saving the digital world, they are finding themselves and you can see them maturing and learning. In Pokemon, Ash and Misty are on a quest to become a great Pokemon something-or-other. They do mature, but the series seems to drag on a bit.
Unlike Pokemon, the ""Digidestined"" do not go out and try to beat up monsters to catch them. Instead the monster and the child were meant for each other. Plus they can talk. They don't have to say their name a million times to communicate. The Digimon consider themselves to be friends more than pets. The monsters can also ""Digivolve"" into many different forms depending, and go back to a previous form. In Pokemon, once they evolve, they can't go back. Pokemon can die, but Digimon never really die, they just get reconfigured.
I think Pokemon is great for little kids, but I think Digimon is a step higher than that. They are both great shows to watch, but Digimon allows you to compare yourself and match your personality up with one of several kids. A lot of the kids I know like it better because it allows them to pick out and pretend who they want to be.",987811200,,2319,4.785536159600998
1389698,5,B00005221P,"With television shows like Pokemon offering 3 episodes for $24.98, and Shows like X-Files, Star Trek and so on offering typically less for $17.98, it is refreshing to see that Saban is properly distributing its programs on DVD as they should be distributed: Inexpensively and abundantly. It is unherd of even in anime circles to procure 13 episodes at this price of any series.
As if that wasn't enough, the series is generally very enjoyable, dispite Saban's best attempt to ""jazz it up"" with cruddy american title music. It remains true to its anime heritage with good animation, action-packed story lines and enjoyable, deep charcters.
Also, its not Pokemon, nor is it a rip off of Pokemon. Pokemon is a low-speed, viturally actionless show with good moral content (just look at how many seasons Ash and Misty have been falling in love). Pokemon definetly has very childish feel to it. Digimon, on the other hand is chock-full of action, emotion, and could be enjoyed by just about anyone.
Let's just hope that this trend will continue. I would love to see season two at this price. I would even pay more for it, but if Saban gives up, there may be no more Digimon DVDs, never mind ones that are an awesome value.

Unless you've been living in a cave for the last two years, this is the latest Japanese Anime craze that was brought to the US. At first I hated this show, due to the childish storyline, something that you'll expect to find in a children anime. However, this wasn't the case as the show progressed. It began showing more mature theme and storylines. As I began to watched the episodes, I was eventually hooked and searched high and low for the previous episodes on DVD. To my disappointment they only had it on VHS. But soon I found out that 13 episodes was coming out on DVD, I quickly put my order in and I am sooo glad that I have a copy. I've been watching the episodes over and over again, I just can't get enough. I hope they release the remaining season on DVD as well, I'll be the first to put my order in.",978393600,,882,4.224852071005917

7929914,3,B00005221P,"NOTE: This review focuses on the first two seasons of the entire Digimon series.

Ever since Digimon: Digital Monsters aired on the now-defunct FOX KIDS Network back in 1999, some people have dismissed it as a hopeless clone of Pok&eacute;mon. But those who have done their research would know that in actuality the entire Digimon franchise was created BEFORE the Pok&eacute;mon franchise. It's just that the TV shows made it all look as if it was vice versa, since Pok&eacute;mon aired just one year before Digimon. Now, I was never a fan of this Japanese ""monster"" craze, but there was something intriguing about Digimon: Digital Monsters. As a matter of fact, compared to most animated kid's shows these days, this one is actually really good.

It's time for Summer Camp, and seven young kids are about to get more than they expect during this time of year. They are somehow transported into another world, where they discover little creatures that evolve into larger beasts whenever there's danger. Seems like a simple premise, but later on in the series it becomes more complicated than usual. Even if it is a clich&eacute; that we've seen many times before (humans find themselves in a different fantastical world), the plot actually progresses as it steadily moves along. It's such an unusual find in kid shows these days, and Digimon is fairly unique in that it has some true plot development from beginning to end. The first thirteen episodes do look like they're intended for kids, but the second half of the first season look as if they're more for adolescents (same goes for the second season). Another thing I should add is that the show is scarcely formulaic. Each episode doesn't repeat itself with just one structure (unlike Pok&eacute;mon or Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, where many of their episodes actually look and feel the same). Granted, the digital monsters do ""digivolve"" somewhere near the end, but still the episodes don't feel like they've been rehashed over and over.

But Digimon doesn't only succeed with plot development. I'm going to be perfectly clear about this: this show has some of the most interesting and realistic characters I have ever seen. I am serious: the human characters (Tai, Sora, Matt, Joe, etc.) are what make this show. Even though they're only kids, they do seem to have some unique qualities about them. Their distinctive personalities are what make them fascinating: Tai as the determined but sometimes foolish leader, Sora as the kind and caring tomboy, Matt as the silent lone wolf, Izzy as the clever computer geek, Mimi as the sweet but prissy girly girl, Joe as the no-nonsense ""voice of reason,"" and T.K. as Matt's positive younger brother. In the second season, you have Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken, and while they aren't as interesting as the characters in the first season, they are still pretty likeable in some corners. In addition to their distinctive personalities, these sorts of characters are closer to reality than we think: for example, Izzy the computer whiz discovers that he's actually adopted, and that his foster parents have kept it secret for so long. In fact, every one of these kids has their issues (Tai's overprotection over his younger sister Kari, Matt and T.K.'s parents divorced, Joe being forced to become a doctor due to tradition. These issues become a part of some of the conflicts between these characters, and therefore there's a lot of tension in the second half of the first and second seasons when the tone of the show starts to become much darker. These sorts of character developments are what I found so refreshing about this animated kid show: it features troubled characters, differing morals, and hard-hitting realism. This sort of thing is now unfortunately rare these days (watch Total Drama Island, and you'll see what I mean), but thankfully Digimon: Digital Monster is a constant reminder that you CAN do wonders with both character development & plot development.

Unfortunately, Digimon: Digital Monsters is not perfect: it has some obvious flaws that one can detect if they only use their eyes and ears. First, the animation in this show is simply awful. In some scenes, you have backgrounds that look only partially complete. In other scenes, freeze-frame is used when an object or a character is moving from one direction to another. Maybe it's because the budget for this show was limited, but whatever the reason, ""unsatisfactory"" is the perfect word I would choose for the animation. Second, the music isn't really anything that's special. You have the infamous theme that's played during the intro, and it's bad. I mean, really, REALLY bad. It's a dreadful aggravation to the ears. The male voices for the lyrics are really agonizing to listen to, and the orchestral music in the entire series (synthesized, obviously) is incredibly mediocre. The rock songs (""Runaround"" & ""Here we Go"") are pretty decent for kids, though. Finally, the screenplays for the show aren't entirely unbearable, but they can be laughable at times (even for a kids show). One-liners and puns become constant, and it can be a bit of a pain as the show progresses. Some of them are indeed funny, but most are overdone.

By the way, do these monsters always have to have ""mon"" at the end of their names? It seems unnecessary.....

In the end, however, I still have a soft spot for this show. Even though the animation and the music do not hold up very well, the plot and the characters are what make this show. Rarely does an animated series that's intended for kids convey real character development & story progression, and this one really delivers both. Unfortunately, the show fails with continuity, as the third and fourth seasons were so drastically different that most of the fans stopped caring. This would lead to the show's cancellation, as well as a reboot that started just a few years ago. I've never seen the newer seasons since the cancellation, but if it's good enough, it'll restore hope in the entire franchise. And hopefully, the official DVD release of the first and second seasons of Digimon: Digital Monsters will be released sometime in the near future.

In short, Digimon: Digital Monsters fails with its poor animation, irritating music, and (sometimes) unintentionally laughable dialogue, but succeeds with its solid plot and intriguing characters.

7929916,1,B00005221P,"Because my earlier review of Season One of Digimon was so widely misunderstood, I've decided to edit this review. First off, this ""Season One"" collection of Digimon episodes is not the entire season. It is a single DVD that contains the first bunch of episodes of the season (the Devimon episodes). It also features a few of the Myotismon episodes. While the episodes with Myotismon weren't bad, I HATE the Devimon episodes. Devimon was a boring villain, and those episodes seemed to be aimed at very young children. If you ever saw the incredibly annoying episode called ""Digibaby boom"", you'll know what I'm talking about. When I saw stupid episodes like that, I felt more like I was watching an episode of the Teletubbies than an ""action/adventure"" cartoon. Since this set of Digimon episodes contains episodes that for the most part annoyed the hell out of me, I give this DVD one star.

Now that I've criticized the DVD, I will devote the rest of this review to discussing the entire first season of Digimon. I liked a lot of episodes from the first season, BUT THOSE EPISODES ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THIS DVD. If the episodes I actually liked were included, I'd give this DVD a higher rating. Season one would always have a major enemy (or group of enemies) for the Digidestined to defeat. The episodes with Etemon were alright, the episodes with Myotismon were good (with a few exceptions), and the episodes with the Dark Masters were AWESOME. But as I've already said, the episodes I enjoyed aren't on this DVD.

As many like to point out, Digimon was made BEFORE Pokemon. Pokemon is a `cute' show that little kids can enjoy, but Digimon is an odd combination of `cute' mixed with `ugly/brutish'. The cute aspects were the rookie digimon, and the digi-destined themselves, who were children. The ugly and brutish aspects were the mega digimon, the evil digimon (like Myotismon and Devimon) and some surprisingly graphic violence, which is aimed at older children. In my case, I LOVED the `ugly/brutish' aspects of the show and HATED the `cute' aspects of the show. That's right - I can't stand the Digidestined, and I was always rooting for the bad guys to win. This DVD contains episodes that largely fall in the `cute' category. Keep in mind, that Digimon was a rather mature show made in Japan that was aimed at teenagers. The geniuses at FOX KIDS dumbed the show down for its American audience, and decided to aim the show at young children. Something I disliked about this is that a lot of young children are exposed to some rather graphic violence (especially in the Digimon movie), but then again, kids today are exposed to graphic violence on a daily basis, so I shouldn't complain. And what follows is the rest of my unedited review, where I discussed what I liked/disliked about Season One of Digimon:

Not a single thing in this show is funny - every joke falls flat. But I did like a lot of the Dark Masters' lines, and a lot of Piedmon and Puppetmon's lines made me laugh with glee. The music in this show is HORRIBLE - some of it sounds like Fred Penner playing an electric guitar. And they play that godawful theme song about a million times in every episode. But they had some dramatic music that sounded really cool playing when Piedmon walks up the stairs of his castle and busts down the doors right before having a fight with Angemon. I especially like the way Piedmon will hold two swords by their hilts in each of his hands, then yell ""TRUMP SWORDS!"" and throw them like darts at his opponent. The sight of someone being impaled by one of his swords is most impressive.

I liked how all the Dark Masters team up to wipe out the Digi-Destined in one knock out blow. But the Digi-Destined escape (unfortunately), and the Dark Masters figure they're so easy to destroy that it would be more fun for each Dark Master to single-handedly take on the Digi-Destined at a time. Unsurprisingly, the Dark Masters pay dearly for their arrogance. I felt especially bad for Piedmon, who went through the terrifying Gate of Destiny.

I like how the Dark Masters are representative of absolute evil - there's no shades of gray here. Their ultimate plan is to eliminate or enslave EVERYONE. I love that plan. None of them have a conscience, or have any delusions that what they are doing isn't evil. Indeed, they derive sadistic pleasure by committing heinous acts - if they were in the real world, such actions would amount to crimes against humanity. The Biblical concepts of `absolute good' and `absolute evil' don't exist in real-life, but it's sometimes refreshing to watch a TV show where they do exist, even if it's a simplified reality. Whether they're screaming ""RIVER OF POWER!"", razing entire cities to the ground, or threatening to destroy the Digi-Destined, I found them so entertaining that a few years ago I taped all the episodes featuring the Dark Masters.

The best quote of the show is when Machinedramon busts through a wall and says in his supercool voice ""Oh good. Just what I was looking for. VICTIMS."" Then Machinedramon proceeds to massacre everyone in his path. Another great moment was when Metaletemon was doing a rock song about destroying the Digi-Destined, then an annoyed and infuriated Puppetmon screams ""ENOUGH!"" before the two have a hilarious brawl and spit a lot of insults at each other.

I took a glance at some of the other negative customer reviews, and some good points are raised. This DVD set is not the whole season, and some nut only seems to have chosen the absolute worst episodes for inclusion of this set. THE EPISODES WITH THE DARK MASTERS AREN'T INCLUDED! Oh well... Machinedramon ought to use Plan ELIMIN EIGHT on this DVD set - notice their use of wordplay?",1155168000,,5720,4.714
