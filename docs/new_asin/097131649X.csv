173661,5,097131649X,I'm glad I found this combo pack instead of buying individually.  The DVD's really are meant to go together.  Good information for anyone whether you're in the business or just want to give a good massage to family and friends.  It's easy to understand - easy to watch and having the DVD's on hand makes it great for showing to friends who want to know more about how I give such GREAT MASSAGES!!!!  I recommend this to EVERYONE!,1101859200,21,429,4.461538461538462
173662,5,097131649X,I bought the two video's separately because they didn't have them offered as a package at the time. I love each of the video's and watch them frequently. I also loan them out to my friends from time to time. The video's made a good addition to my library and I highly recommend them to anyone IN or OUT of the business. If you want to give a good massage you need to know the basics. These two video's remind me of the basic and intermediate techniques - and having them to watch from time to time is an excellent refresher course right in the privacy of my home.  (I'm also submitting this review on the DVD site as I bought them in DVD format - but I wanted you to know that they're a great set),1100131200,32,697,4.087591240875913

173664,5,097131649X,"This massage package was a good investment and I'm happy with my purchase.  I was quite impressed with the Basic Massage Therapy Tape and the tape for Pro's.  It covered the full gamut.  The Basic tape reviewed the skeletal structure - which we all need to give a good, healthy massage.  The instructor knew what he was doing and obviously has been in the business for quite some time.  I enjoyed the advanced techniques of the second tape as well.  I'm glad I bought the package.  Thank you for putting them together and at a good price!",1100044800,19,538,4.484536082474227
173665,4,097131649X,I found the basic to be ok but the camera could have focused more on the actual techniques.  The professional video was better in terms of instruction and skill development. The quality was not great but I didn't mind much.  The biggest issue I had with both videos was the draping.  As an instructor I train student to be very conscious of keeping the body sufficiently covered.  They only used a little towel to cover the client.  I usually use a twin to full sheet and the only part exposed is the area I am working. That is the real professional standard.  Otherwise I recommend it for instruction.,1072656000,21,602,4.527777777777778
173666,5,097131649X,"I'm not in a position where I can leave my job and go to school and these tapes have given me the instruction that I would gain had I the ability to go.  The instructor, who is obviously an expert in his field, showed me the basics techniques from working the muscles with the grain and across the grain to ""get the knots out"".  He walked me through a basic anatomy course, which in class could be pretty boring, but he made it simple and easy to understand and showed how and why it's necessary if  you're going to practice massage therapy.
These tapes are good if you're going to go into it as a business, or if you just want to know how to give a good massage.
Thank you for them!  It's an inexpensive price to pay compared to sitting in class for hundreds of hours and paying thousands of dollars.
A satisfied buyer.",1069545600,26,820,4.237179487179487
173667,4,097131649X,"These two dvds really do cover a wide range of massage techniques. The Basic Massage dvd is best to base your routine around. The Professional Massage dvd goes into more technical detail with names of different muscles and tissues. The Professional Massage dvd also goes one step further and gives some tips on setting up your own massage business. The reason why I give this product only 4 stars is the production quality is poor, especially on the Professional Massage dvd. The picture quality is grainy and when the instructer points to notes on a dry erase board, the picture is so over-lighted that you can not read parts of the board. However, this dvd is still worth the cost for all the information that you get. For those people who are interested in massage therapy as a career, I also suggest the book ""Massage Therapy Career Guide"" by Steve Capellini (ISBN: 1562533827). This book covers all the behind the scenes business to becomming a massage therapist. One of the best parts of the book gives tips on massage tests. I have yet to find anything more nerve racking than giving a test massage to a potential future employer, but this section takes a lot of tension out of the situation. Other great features include liability insurance, taxes, third-party billing, dream and nightmare days in the life a massage therapist and the Resource section is lengthy, concise and filled with addresses, phone numbers and URLs.",1055548800,70,1430,4.840816326530613
173668,4,097131649X,For beginner this was a nice complete massage pack: Basic & Professional Massage Therapy. And I did like it a lot.,1417651200,,114,4.476190476190476
173669,1,097131649X,The material was poorly produced and narrated on one disc and the second disc was a poor reproduction from what looked like an old VCR tape,1409356800,,139,4.384615384615385

173671,1,097131649X,"It is advertised for beginners and 'professional massage therapists.'  As a professional massage therapist, I thought it might be worth the investment to add to my massage library - IT ISN'T.  It is extremely elementary and the quality of the DVD production is shockingly poor; at times, one cannot see what the massage therapist is doing.  There is NO DISCUSSION re body mechanics, which is primary for anyone doing massage (""take care of your own body"").  The anatomy portion - most if not all written on an erasable marker board - is unreadable due to reflections and some hand drawings of muscles (again - suggest a book or include this 'manual' that is often referenced -  PowerPoint graphs or printouts should have been used in the DVD production, as well as referring people to an Anatomy book such as Trail Guide to the Body by Andrew Biel, which is one of my main anatomy book references.  Throughout the showing of the 'how to' do an actual massage, the words come across the screen:  ""refer to the manual"" but there ISN'T ANY MANUAL accompanying the DVD to refer to.  I feel the person who put this together means well, however it is very poorly executed and it certainly is NOT for people already trained as a professional massage therapist.  I admit that of the two DVDs provided, I went right to the one that was for 'professionals' and skipped the first one for beginners.  I feel sad to write this actually.  I really believe the owner/creator of this DVD wants to offer some valuable instruction.  It is simply a very poor quality over all.  There is NO skipping to the next segment, i.e., neck, legs, back - it is all one very long DVD so a person can't jump back and forth to review specific areas.",1399766400,5,1717,4.590163934426229
173672,1,097131649X,I received a great massage table as a gift and hoped to learn the best way to give a professional massage.  The photographer in this video was always at least 10 feet away!  Who cares about seeing the table legs and the masseuse past the height of the table!  I want to see up close shots of the masseuse's hands massaging and working the flesh!  Anyone wanting to give the best massage needs to see EXACTLY how it's done!  This video is no help whatsoever!,1394323200,,457,4.329411764705882
173673,4,097131649X,Very good DVD .  Very informative. Just what I wanted to brush up on my massaging skills. Would recommend it,1386720000,,108,4.4
173674,2,097131649X,"This product arrived in great time, but once I received it, I was disappointed. Not because the content of the DVD wasn't good, but because I couldn't get past the quality of the filming. It was horrible. It looked as if the vendor had copied the ORIGINAL DVD over a thousand times. The people were fuzzy and unclear. I won't be ordering from this vendor for a while.",1374364800,2,367,4.411764705882353
173675,1,097131649X,I was lulled to sleep by this one and don't think I ever quite got it. Boring to watch and frankly didn't teach anything,1353110400,,120,4.041666666666667
173676,2,097131649X,I bought this with intent of learning the basics of massage. I didn't expect to have to sit thru a complete fmassage. You know you can discribe the process of each point of the body and move on. I don't need to see the rest of the five or ten minutes of the process without not a word being said,1353110400,,295,3.933333333333333

173678,4,097131649X,"Complete (as title states) gave me the impression more than technique was taught in this DVD set.  Just two different DVDs with two different instructors.  The 2nd ""Professional Massage Therapy v2.0"" is the better DVD.  It also goes into a lesson on muscles and Aroma Therapy.  1st one, a bit like watching someone else get a massage and waiting.  Anyway, if you have the option, I'd recommend just ordering the 2nd DVD instead of both.  I learned more from it.",1339372800,3,461,4.7
173679,3,097131649X,"It was good to see different skill sets from both professional and non. I was able to follow along preforming a massage on an actual person. They could not tell I was following the dvd, the session flowed well.",1323129600,3,210,4.410256410256411
173680,3,097131649X,"This is a two VHS product. The first VHS (Basic) was wonderfully done and photographed. Bravo to them. The second VHS (Professional) was pretty bad. The sound quality was bad, the writing on the board was bad-and at times-you couldn't read it. The massage viewing part was good. So, if you are only interested in watching other people's massage techniques, then this is the video for you (well worth the money).",1316304000,3,411,4.802816901408451
173681,4,097131649X,This DVD was a great buy to me.  It secured some skills I already knew and showed me a couple I didnt.  The Professional portion got me to thinking about restudying my massage notes.,1315958400,3,182,4.323529411764706
173682,5,097131649X,"I took two little massage courses at a community college and then got this video.

It's nice for helping to learn how to give a nice basic massage.",1308960000,6,292,4.425925925925926
173683,5,097131649X,"Now this is one I'd suggest.  I've looked around and purchased several massage instructional videos with very mixed results.  Some were older looking, some lacked actual teaching and some were just gross.

This one is a pretty good balance of all.  It concentrated on instruction but didn't have any distracting features or filming.",1290643200,3,332,5.2075471698113205
173684,2,097131649X,"The material, all of it, is of very poor quality, both in presentation and content. It looks like very old material rehashed.

The ""Basic Massage"" DVD is a recording of a therapist giving a massage. Unfortunately, in my view at least, if someone new to massage does not know which muscle is being massaged, in which direction, with which technique and to what purpose, it is very hard for them to periodically pause the presentation and meaningfully copy the activity shown in the DVD. There is much better material available on the web for free

The ""Professional Massage"" DVD is NOT advanced and would make a reasonable ""Basic Massage"" DVD if it was re-edited (e.g. move the anatomy to the start and use better graphics), the Shiatsu sections removed and the sessions re-recorded in higher quality.
The workbook is very poor compared to other books available; there are no detailed diagrams of the muscles to be massaged! Etc., etc..

In summary, this is a load of old material well passed its sell-by date which should be re-done rather than resold. You do get quite a lot for your money, but you would do much better to save up and buy a higher quality product.

PS Re Available Material: A review of (better) massage material (DVDs, books etc) available can be found at the TerraRosa massage web site

It scores the Basic Massage Therapy video 0/5 and says ""This DVD is a waste of time. Available on the web and Amazon with great hype and labels such as ""#1 best seller"" & ""A must see"" by Dr. Heith Root, ""Golden Web Award"". ""Recommended by Indiana College of Oriental Medicine"", This college is a Martial Arts College run by a church. Showing June a ""certified therapist"" giving Swedish massage from a distance.""

It scores the Massage Therapy for Professionals video 0/5 and says ""A complete waste of money & time. Another deceiving series. It is blurry, cheaply made and filmed on a home video. The first part shows some massage techniques by a ""professional"", and the second part the narrator gave a lecture on the anatomy of muscles on a whiteboard with hand drawn pictures.""

I should have read this before buying the set

Not only are this company's products apparently highly rated by obscure/bizarre/non-existent organisations and ""experts"", I note that many of the rave reviewers appear to (i) have bought many/all of this company's products (and largely only their products, no other massage products that I can see), (ii) rated them all 5/5 and (iii) used extreme, over-the-top superlatives to describe these very mediocre products. One of the products is even given 5/5 by someone who admits that they have not yet bought it.
Some of the products seem to have been reviewed several times by the same person, with different stories as to how/why they bought them and how wonderful they were. All very Puzzling.

Update. You will also note how many people vote against any negative review of this company's products. Normally you vote against a review if it has nothing to do with the product (e.g. the postage service) or if it simply says that something is rubbish without explaining why.  This is an honest, detailed review - look at the number of negative votes.",1283126400,7,3182,4.80073126142596
173685,2,097131649X,"A bit of a let down on expectations -epecially on content. This is not a professionally constructed dvd. -So don't build your hopes up too high like I did. (Expected a brief but concise guide on massage basic and professional techniques. -Example types of strokes, demonstrations of each type of strokes, muscles targeted with ones actions, -perhaps a brief on chronological coordination and timing oneself for a full body 1hr session, etc. --you get the picture -expected it to be a sufficient preparation DVD for a student, etc. Instead it is wanting/'lacking' -even from the 'professional' DVD.# In some cases of the video's demonstrations, instructor's hands are not directly visible to the camera. Prior to purchase, based on reviews, was originally willing to overlook image video quality for content. However, not satisfied with content. Video lacks sequence/ structure and is not fluid and does not give the option to be, in the basic DVD -so that's a bit annoying. -For the price and hype, expected different.
  Would not recommend as a first buy DVD or foundation DVD for a student -Won't get you mentally prepared for what is ahead of you at massage academy. ...-The acupressure highlights were interesting but not much to brag about. the anatomy/physiology highlights were really limited/basic. #-A text book has more appeal.# Overall review; So very sorry to say but honestly; ""Long, boring and unco-ordinated"" P.s.. it's like a low-budget movie doesn't seem like much effort was put into it as could have been....-Have seen better mini-clips in terms of content on YouTube. Doesn't make for a handy reference DVD. :-S -If you're like me, you won't like it. -And it really disappoints me to say that. Would have loved to have given a better review but if I have to be honest, I truely can't on this one. On a positive note I won't bash the seller cause delivery was timely, and in that respect, service was good. My issue is with the video(s) itself. (Not sure if this was supposed to come as an accompaniment to a textbook cuz it was labled that way on the package, but I only got the the 2 DVDs in the case -and it didn't seem like an original either.)
  (Is any one from a student's-need perspective able to make a better recommendation of a more useful DVD to serve as a good/an excellent reference guide in your student library?) In other purchases, I really do appreciate Steve Capellini's book 'Massage Therapy Career Guide' and the All inclusive Sierra Comfort Portable Massage Table (-With a slight reservation on the construction material when folding, but it's stable when standing -considering accessories makes a good",1268352000,5,2643,4.9192825112107625

Unfortunately, the lady on the tape uses a lot of technical / medical terminology that we did not understand.  The filming was so poor that we could not generally see what she was doing to even try to mimic her.
