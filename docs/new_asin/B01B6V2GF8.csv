7622257,4,B01B6V2GF8,"Review of the DVD version  and bonus features  with no Spoilers
If you are coming to this review, you have most likely already seen the previous seasons, so I will not discuss the background of the show. I don't consider it a spoiler  and you won't find any spoilers here (I hate those)  but the series was planned to be four seasons and there are virtually no loose ends.

I have to admit that I did not enjoy the story line in this season as much as the earlier ones which focused on how Harry Selfridge built up his store as well as centering on the private lives of selected store workers. This season is a much darker season with very few happy moments. Some characters will leave, a few new ones will arrive and one of my favorite characters (no Im not saying who) will return. I found one plot device that the writers (there are different ones for different episodes) very forced and there is a villain here too, though a lot different than that smarmy Lord Loxley, from earlier seasons.

The writers interpolate some real life characters who come to the store  including singer Albert Hunter and the Dolly Sisters (both from America).
The action takes place 20 years after Season one and yet some of the characters like Mr. Crab and Mr. Grove don't seem to have aged. And it looks like Jeremy Pivens Harry is using hair coloring to hide his gray.

I still am glad I watched this season because the story arc does come to a proper end. I just thought there was more filler to get to 10 45-minute episodes.

The DVD  has four special features:
The (now-requisite) Making of: featurette  7 minutes
The Rise and Fall of Harry Selfridge a 3-minute featurette on the characters continuing ups and downs (the melodrama part of the show)
The Ladies of Selfridges  a 3  minute featurette on the stores distaff staff
A An Interview with Jeremy Piven  A 6-minute on-set interview (just commentary actually) with the star.
There are English subtitles (but you probably won't need them)

The series is a a fictional melodrama based on some real characters and some fictional ones. The real Harry Selfridge lived into his 90s but the series only takes us up to his 60s. Youll need to read a bio to find out about his later years.

By the way. - unlike previous seasons where it said ""Original UK version"" on the front of the package, this time it says that in smaller print on the BACK of package.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7622258,5,B01B6V2GF8,"Mr Selfridge was the rival in 2013 to The Paradise which began a year earlier. IN 2013 they went head-to-head and Mr Selfridge won, and now continues for its 4th season. Every season of both series is excellent and worth the purchase. Own, don't rent, as this is worth multiple viewings, that good. They deal with the same real story of the man who made the big department store an item of history.
Harry Selfridge continues to be played by Jeremy PIven, flawlessly. He has department store office help in Crabb (Ron Cook) and Grove (Tom Goodman-Hill). Others who have been with this show from the start and continue are Miss Mardle (Amanda Abbington), Frank (Samuel West) Victor (Trystan Gravelle), George (Calum Callaghan), Kitty (Amy Beth Hayes), well the list continues.

New 2016 episodes, aired beginning in January, with the storys beginning in 1928. Lady Mae (Katherine Kelley- all 10 episodes after being gone for 2015) returns to London, and of course Harry gets himself into financial difficulty again with hasty promotional decisions. Grove celebrates his 20 years with Selfridges.
Family dynamics and relationship are played up in episode two and a highlight, or low-light, of the third is an affair of a significant person.
As can be expected, in the typical Selfridge fashion, the store has its ups and downs with more sub-plots and relationship issues than the store has departments. Outsiders get involved, as does Harry, not his first unwise fling. Its more and more of the same old fantastic storylines and believable acting. So many returning characters it is like a family reunion.
TEN new episodes; but fans will crave more, just what Harry Selfridge depends upon. Alas, Season 4 is the end of this series. Bonus material states such.
I bought and saved and have watched and re-watched every season. Go ahead and pick up The Paradise on DVD and youll see a parallel story, and learn just how GREAT Mr Selfridge had to be to beat out the competition in 2013.
Mr Selfridge is a Masterpiece modern classic, worth more than five stars at our house.",1456963200,42,2066,4.886039886039886
7622259,3,B01B6V2GF8,"If I was rating the Mr. Selfridge series, I would give it a 5.  My husband and I thuroughly have enjoyed this series and we have every season on DVD.  However, the last DVD has some flaws.  The third disc in our set has places where it messes up and we have not been able to watch a single show on that disc all the way through.  The third disc on this particular DVD is a problem and if I was rating the disc, I would give it a 1.

7622262,3,B01B6V2GF8,"I was chef Selfridges because I am a fan of period pieces. Jeremy Piven never seemed to fit into the character much. Sure his brazen acting quality would seem to fit the bill but it seemed like he never gave himself to the character. The fact he hardly aged in the series was also a it strange. But I suppose that was a marketing thing. What distressed me the most was the Lady Mae character. The actress who played h r was superb but please someone give this lady some food. It was painful to watch her with her anorexic body. OMG if she is that thin on screen what is she in real life. At least in the earlier costumes she was covered up. I know that is not really a critique of the series but it does affect how one sees it. It was okay. Harry had no good judgement, gambled, the Dolly sisters were annoying and you wonder why they were such a sensation.",1488844800,,857,4.137724550898204

Pro:
- Visually stunning
- The clothing and costume are a thing of beauty ( I want all the gowns!)
- Historically accurate and gets all the details right  (even the cosmetics are correct at the store)
- Easy to understand the actors and follow along
- You will want to teleport back to WWI and shop in their store
- The love stories are so well done be sure to have some Kleenex around

- The fourth season is the last season!

7622350,4,B01B6V2GF8,"The acting was superb, and the entire season will please big time.  I loved it. I did have a problem with the plot..the writers could have done a better job.  It would have been a much better story IF they simply stuck with the facts.  I also thought they dragged out the funeral scene far too long. The death of Mr. Grove was very sappy.

I would have added more to the Dolly Sisters--Rose died age 77 (around 1970, but that could have been an epilogue) of a heart attack (a few years prior to that she tried to kill herself but was unsuccessful); Jenny killed herself at age 48 (year 1941 by hanging herself--that could have been part of the story as in a separate subplot).  During their heyday, The Dolly Sisters were symbols of prestige and every wealthy man wanted them--so for Harry they were more of a status symbol combined with huge gambling debts which Harry paid for in the sum of $4 million.

Harry wanted to marry Jenny and offered her $10 million for the privilege. That was never put in the show.  Jenny decided to vacation, had a serious auto accident, ended up with mutilated, and had plastic surgeries for facial reconstruction which Jenny pawned off most of her jewelry (which was massive) to pay for these expenses--Harry paid for the remaining treatments--but never married her.  Jenny ended up broke by selling off the rest of her jewelry...anyway she ended up hanging herself at age 48.  I think this would have been fascinating plot -- not Lady May.

Harry had an exuberant lifestyle including yachts, rented royal apartments, etc., and amassing debts due to the Dolly Sisters which Harry charged to the company...which they tolerated until the Great Depression.  There was no huge over-investment. That part did not happen.  There was no Lady May to bail him out in the end.  In fact, nobody really wanted him when he was down and out...just like the song.

THAT would have been more of an interesting story...

Harry Selfridge was essentially fired and ended up broke and spent his days just staring at the huge department store that he created. He was once arrested for vagrancy.  How sad that was not put in the show.  Harry retired with a meager pension, rented a three-bedroom flat with Rosalie, his oldest daughter.  Harry, Jr., was also not part of the store...in fact not much is known about him.  Harry left no fortune because he had none to give. My understanding is that Harry, Jr., wanted no part of his father.

I think if they stuck with what really happened instead of embellishing they would have produced a much better show..",1464739200,13,2568,4.651884700665189

7622352,4,B01B6V2GF8,Just watched this and knew it was based on a true story of a man with many passions for women and gambling while neglecting time with his family. He built a great financial empire but frittered it away senselessly and in the end lost everything. He even spent a pile of money on the Dolly Sisters but most of you won't remember them. I was sorry it didn't have a happy ending.,1464652800,,376,4.236111111111111
