8721446,5,B0106URBK0,"Absolutely loved it, for the past decade documentaries about aliens, da foot, and otherwise have used the gimmick of sudden cuts to black with audio of some excitement only to be let down later. Mr. Mascella does an amazing job of keeping the tone, pace, and presentation of information in a decent flow, no tremendously long pauses of b-roll that establish nothing. His transitions introduce you to the lovable nature of those around him in brief cuts, such as his supporting father, freshly tatted camera operator, and others.  He does not present his skeptics in a negative light, nor does he embellish on his witnesses.  As a documentary overall I'd give it an A-, the only complaint I had was I wanted his adventure to continue, but he ended without pandering or leaving a cliff hanger. As a man he looked into the camera and stated why he had to stop.  Hats off to Mr. Mascella and his crew.",1523491200,,897,4.628930817610063

8721449,1,B0106URBK0,"Tremendously disappointing.  I can appreciate that someone went through this much trouble to do a documentary on Bigfoot. But in the end it's a home movie with nothing to show. If you're interested in an hour long home movie, with absolutely nothing new revealed about Bigfoot, filled with skeptics opinions and the commercialization of Bigfoot, then go ahead and spend the money to rent this. I guess I was most disappointed with the young man who did this film acting as if he hated being in the woods even exploring the possibilities of coming up with some bigfoot evidence.  If you have no passion for something, don't do it.  Go back to your ""beer and your hot showers"". His dad was far more enthusiastic than he was.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could.",1446940800,5,755,4.57037037037037
