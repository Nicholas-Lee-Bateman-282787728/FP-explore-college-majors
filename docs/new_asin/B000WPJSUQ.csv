8224967,1,B000WPJSUQ,"Rarely in the history of cinema has a title lied so overtly. ""My Boys Are Good Boys"" is a terrible film in every way, featuring a bunch of very bad boys. Starting with the loathsome title song (complete with noxious synthesizer solo, a soundtrack trend that persists through the entire ordeal,) through a ridiculous plot about a bunch of youthful convicts pulling an armored truck job, this movie is one of the worst of the late 1970s. Ralph Meeker and Ida Lupino star as a perniciously crabby couple with awful children, one of whom, Tommy (Sean Roche,) is the leader of the JD breakout and is a grisly overactor (though Tommy isn't necessarily the biggest family problem as the tawdry surprise ending reveals.) Sadly Tommy's not alone in his performance: everyone is chewing the scenery here, and the dialogue and direction sink what was already an uninteresting story that fails to elicit sympathy for any of the protagonists.

This movie is boring and vapid. The acting is amateurish despite the presence of some modestly big name actors (most notably Lupino, Meeker, and Lloyd Nolan,) while the plot is riddled with holes, is wholly unrealistic, and is just plain boring (just how is it that all the adults are so dimwitted and gullible, anyway?)

Let's just call it what it is: this is a grind.",1395446400,,1300,4.799107142857143

The film begins at night in front of a liquor store. A man runs out, shots are fired. A police car shows up, there is a crash. Next we see a jail for teenagers. There is a conflict in the bathroom. One inmate has a visitor, his father. We learn why he is there, Tommy has an attitude. ""There's not one bad kid in the whole bunch."" [Wishful thinking?] Will those boys pull a trick on their jailer? Will Prissy make an error in judgment? Bess commands her home. There is subtle humor in this story. [Are those adults really that gullible?] An armored truck makes a cash pickup. What did they learn in reform school? What kind of gas was in those cans? Will they escalate their crimes? Is there a flaw in their plans? ""This is just like a movie."" [A really bad movie?]

There is an unmarked car that checks on the armored truck. The older man is suspicious, and calls for help. One guard resists. A car chase to create action. The gang gathers the loot. What if the getaway car won't start? [More comedy?] A stuck gas pedal? Will they get back in time for a perfect alibi? [It is a movie.] Bert Morton is questioned about his lack of a warning. Bess gives him a lecture. ""Can it!"" Morton remembers things. There is emotional conflict at home. [Some sort of psychological explanation?] Dan Montgomery visits them to ask questions. ""Kids are lousy liars"", they need years of practice to lie like adults. Harry Klinger has a secret. There is a big surprise at the end! Did you get the clue? The loose ends remain untied.

This is a typical drive-in movie and morality play. It won't win any awards. Ida Lupino and Lloyd Nolan were big movie stars in their day and show their talents in this barely average story. Was the composition of this gang modeled on the old ""Our Gang"" comedies?",1268006400,2,1813,4.3898809523809526
