8188568,5,B000P2A558,Turning 60 and can't touch my toes and have never done yoga or pilates.  At first I couldn't do alot of the exercises more than once or twice but Sue West is so easy to follow and the music is so soothing that I couldn't wait to do it again.,1260230400,3,241,3.82
8188569,2,B000P2A558,"I was looking for something with more elements of dance such as Ballet moves incorporated into a workout. There was little to do with Ballet in the program. The sceneries in this workout are, as a matter of fact, amazing!! However, my criteria of a great workout is 1) content 2) content 3) content. It was a relaxing workout but there are lots of other better choices out there with more reasonably priced.",1229904000,,407,4.589041095890411
8188570,5,B000P2A558,"Got this 2nd Santa Fe Stretch DVD last week and I really enjoyed this new one with the seasonal changes and stretches.  Love the scenery, music and the great stretches.  These stretches can give you a great and enjoyable workout (if you want ot call it).  It is a nice change of pace from cardio and weight.  This still energizes and strengthens.",1200873600,7,346,4.532258064516129
8188571,5,B000P2A558,"This is a beautiful exercise video that incorporates a really good workout with wonderful scenery and superb music.  Each season is filmed in a different location including the mountains of Montana, the fields of blue bonnet flowers in Texas and the red rocks of Utah.  There is poignant symbolism between the nature inspired locations and the type of workout each season offers.  The music is just perfect.  Sue West is a super teacher and role model.  I would enthusiastically recommend this DVD.",1177459200,7,498,5.024390243902439
