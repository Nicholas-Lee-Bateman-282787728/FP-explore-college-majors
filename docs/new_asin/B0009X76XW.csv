2334458,5,B0009X76XW,"The unknown and the darker fears which many of us felt or mused on  as the millennium milestone approached was captured by Chris Carter and the other producers in this gem of a series.  Lance Henriksen was perfect for the role and he never slipped throughout the entire run.  Every aspect of the show was well-crafted, and the results resonated with a group of devoted fans such as myself.  I still play the ""holiday"" episodes every Halloween and Christmas.  Acting, music, characters, photography, production all wonderfully done. But the bottom line:  Lance Henriksen rocks!!",1122768000,10,577,5.085106382978723
2334459,5,B0009X76XW,"Looking 5 stars rating in the 3th season-- excellent. it means the all complete collection is very interesting, I watch the series one, 2, 3  and I see my favourite chapters very times!! I recommend this collection. Maybe you'll find some chapters without interest or maybe bored but every TV series hae some ""rare"" chapter. This is Millennium!",1122768000,3,344,4.931034482758621
2334460,5,B0009X76XW,"If you have read my reviews on the other two seasons, you'll know i'm a HUGE fan of Chris Carter's Millennium. Season three was a lot more 'back to basics' for the gang where they had a lot more straight crime solving instead of it being supernatural. A very dark and at some times hard to watch show, Millennium will take you deep into the minds of various people least of all Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and the criminals he tries to track down. If you're a die-hard fan like me, you'll love it. So just buy it. If not, then why are you reading this review? I 'ain't gonna change your mind.",1121817600,8,594,4.265486725663717
2334461,5,B0009X76XW,"Season Three of Millennium is the final installment of what I feel is one of the greatest television shows ever made.

In this season Frank Black returns to the FBI and continues his work as a serial profiler.  He teams up unofficially with rookie FBI special agent Emma Hollis and together they work diligently in solving many baffling and macabre crimes.  The Millennium Group itself is still a lurking threat to Frank and its covert agenda comes to a head near the end of the season.

Many viewers have stated that this season is weaker than the previous two and is simply a watered-down version of the X-Files. I agree in part with this view since many of the episodes were straight crime-solving by teamwork with very little mystical/supernatural references (compared with Season Two).

The production quality was still outstanding and indeed some of the very best episodes of the series were produced this season.  Episodes such as ""Skull & Bones"", ""Through a Glass Darkly"", ""Omerta"", ""Borrowed Time"", ""The Sound Of Snow"", ""Antipas"", ""Saturn Dreaming Of Mercury"", ""Bardo Thodol"" and ""Seven and One"" were all brilliant.  The other episodes, whilst still very good, seemed to lack direction and were weaker in overall intensity.  Episodes such as ""Human Essence"", ""The Innocents"", ""TEOTWAWKI"", ""Closure"" and ""Nostalgia"" were a few that didn't quite hit the mark.

I would have no hesitation in recommending this DVD set to Millennium fans or even casual viewers of intelligent, thought-provoking TV.",1121558400,10,1503,5.127049180327869
2334462,5,B0009X76XW,"Chris Carter's MILLENNIUM (1996-1999) was the greatest show, certainly in the history of the FOX network, if not television itself.

Lance Henriksen played Frank Black for three years and 67 episodes in which this craggy, line-faced ex-FBI criminal profiler faced evil in all its conceivable incarnations to protect his wife and daughter Jordan from its wrath.

The final season (1998-1999) was 22 episodes of decidedly mixed results:

The show started with a two-part season premiere, beginning with ""THE INNOCENTS"". It was a mildly interesting story of a downed airliner and bizarre blondes, seemingly involving the Millennium Group. That continued with ""EXEGESIS"", in which Frank and his new FBI partner Emma Hollis tried to determine the Group's involvement. ""TEOTWAWKI"" (aka The End of the World as We Know It) was a story of school violence and survivalists awaiting Y2K. ""CLOSURE"" involved Emma's sister's death at a young age and the connection with a seemingly motiveless killer.

""...THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"" was an enjoyable Halloween story that somehow mixed murders patterned on 80s and 70s horror films, a performance by the band KISS, and the black comedy that the show tried to use in the second season. ""SKULL & BONES"" was the unusual story of buried bodies in Maine and the nebbishy young man who tried to escape the clutches of the Millennium Group. It showed what ""really"" happened to Cheryl Andrews (the great CCH Pounder), in case we weren't to believe last season's ""THE HAND OF ST. SEBASTIAN"". ""THROUGH A GLASS, DARKLY"" was the disturbing and atmospheric story of an Oregon child molester released after several years to his old hometown, only to have his past and a new set of crimes follow him there. ""HUMAN ESSENCE"" was a lame attempt at X-Files-esque horror in which Emma's junkie half-sister faced mutation-causing drugs in Vancouver.

""OMERTA"" (aka Holiday) was the infinately enjoyable Christmas episode in which a mobster resurfaces (from the dead?) after his healers, a couple of sweet sisters in the woods, are threatened. ""BORROWED TIME"" was the story of a series of drowning deaths that featured the return (in character, if not performance) of an angel from the first season! ""COLLATERAL DAMAGE"" was the story of Watts' daughter's kidnapping at the hands of a bitter ex-Gulf War soldier who blamed the Millennium Group. ""THE SOUND OF SNOW"" was the story of a series of recordings that seemed to cause deaths, leading Frank to face his wife Catherine's own demise.

""ANTIPAS"" was the story of Lucy Butler being the nanny for a Wisconsin senator's daughter, leading Frank to try to prove her as the evil woman she is. ""MATRYOSHKA"" was the intriguing mix of the origins of the Millennium Group, the Atom Bomb and J. Edgar Hoover's creation of both. ""FORCING THE END"" was the interesting story of a pregnant woman's kidnapping by a Jewish cult. ""SATURN DREAMING OF MERCURY"" was the story of Jordan's unhealthy fascination with the new kid on the block, a seemingly evil little boy with supernatural powers.

""DARWIN'S EYE"" was the great story of a young mental patient kidnapping and falling in love with a highway patrolman after her bloody escape. ""BARDO THODOL"" was an interesting tale of Millennium Group pseudoscience involving red bowls. ""SEVEN AND ONE"" introduced a new theme: Frank's fear of water and the haunting pictures of his own drowning! ""NOSTALGIA"" involved a murder in Emma's hometown.

""VIA DOLOROSA"" was part one of what turned out to be a two-part series finale. It was the story of an Ed Cuffle-esque serial killer seemingly engineered by the Millennium Group. Frank investigates as Emma's ties to the Group deepen. ""GOODBYE TO ALL THAT"" was the bittersweet finale in which Frank and Jordan had to finally escape from the Group as Watts and Emma gave in to their inconceivable futures.

The series continued, sort of, in a seventh season X-FILES episode, fittingly titled ""MillenniuM"". It was the story of Frank helping FBI agents Scully and Mulder investigate mysterious graverobbings that lead to the discovery of zombies being conjured by the Group's remaining member.

The show is, all in all, a success, if not totally. It had its lame moments and HUMAN ESSENCE is an all-time low. But the show, overall was great!

2334463,5,B0009X76XW,"Well, it's about time that the 3rd season of this show came out! I've been waiting a long time to complete my Chris Carter collection!  I'm not going to list a description of every episode, because I don't want to ruin everything for first-time viewers. ;-)

Millennium underwent some drastic changes over its 3-year run; the first season, the Millennium Group seemed to be a legitimate criminal consultant firm, with interesting abilitiesm now employing ex-FBI agent Frank Black, who wants to raise his daughter in a safer world with his wife Catherine. Season 1 also introduced one of the darkest (and most underutilized) villains in the series; Lucy Butler, who could possibly be the devil. In the second season, Frank was smack-dab in the middle of it, seperated from his family as the Group became larger, darker, and more terrifying as its true knowledge and dangerous capabilities became known, leading to a viral outbreak in Seattle, which killed 80 people, including Catherine. Frank also encountered Lucy Butler, though she evaded him once again.

In the 3rd season, Frank had left the Millennium Group and was back at the FBI, after recovering from the mental collapse he suffered from Catherine's death. He unofficially teamed up with Special Agent Emma Hollis, and they began attempting to bring Millennium to justice, which had become a distant, yet still dangerous villain. He also had one (maybe two; see Saturn Dreaming of Mercury and decide for yourself) more encounter with the evil Lucy Butler, who tried to tempt him into ruling the world with her (if that ain't the devil, what is?). We also got to see a lot more of his daughter Jordan in this season than the previous two, played by the gifted Brittany Tiplady, who I haven't seen in anything since a DELL computers commercial a few years back. The series ended with the apparent demise of Frank's onetime friend Peter Watts, and his taking his daughter and disappearing.

Although Millennium's finale was reasonably conclusive, fans of the series, and Chris Carter himself, weren't quite satisfied with it, and made an episode which crossed Millennium with the X-Files, which took place on the Millennium Eve, Dec. 31, 1999 (and for those who say the new Millennium began in 2001, I quote Mulder: No one likes a math geek, Scully.), in which Frank Black teamed up with Mulder and Scully to save the world from ending. It seems they did!

Millennium's 3rd season was the end of a great series, but I'm glad it ended where it did, instead of dragging through a 4th season which in all likelihood would've ruined it. Millennium had its full run, and ended successfully. Buy this season and complete the collection today! You won't be sorry!",1120780800,92,2712,4.8997821350762525
2334464,5,B0009X76XW,"Chip Johannessen faced a difficult creative challenge when he became Millennium's Executive Producer at the start of the third season. The show's fictional world had seemingly been brought to an end at the close of the previous year.  How could the creative staff continue a series in which most of the major characters and powerful plot threads had apparently been put to rest? The answer to this question, of course, was to reinvent the series once again.

The final season of Millennium began with a shaky start. Fortunately, it didn't take long for the cast and crew to meet and triumph over these challenges, and the results were commendable. Millennium's third season provided some of the show's most intelligent, bizarre, and intriguing stories.  As a result, the episodes presented in this collection offer viewers a glimpse at the show's remarkable range.  There are tales of police investigation, complex conspiracies, black comedy, scientific threats, and classic horror.  Millennium was an artistic drama series unlike any other and it continues to stand apart in the annals of television history.

Sadly, nothing could save the series from the harsh demands of the network television industry. Just months before the dawn of the new millennium, the series was canceled and aired its final episode. Frank Black's journey had come to an end, and this DVD collection presents the thrilling conclusion to the Millennium mythology.  It is not to be missed.",1120003200,21,1464,5.177966101694915

2334466,5,B0009X76XW,"SPOILER ALERT
The Innocents/Exegesis
Having relocated to Virginia after the death of his wife during the viral outbreak 5 months earlier, Frank Black has returned to the FBI and is investigating an airplane crash and a house explosion, even though there is seemingly no connection between the two. Along with rookie agent Emma Hollis and much to the annoyance of supervisor McClaren and crash team leader Baldwin, Frank finds that the recent disasters are a result of the Millenium Group's systematic execution of the offspring of an elderly woman who was once part of the goverment's experiment's in psychic spying...
Sound complicated ?  It is and the opening two parter is a real mess !  This is sadly due to the new producer's of Millenium going out of their way to rewrite what Morgan and Wong had set up in the season 2 cliffhanger.  That's not to say that the storyline is completely without merit as there are the odd moments that make the viewing worthwhile, eg. the brief glimpse of Frank's therapy video where he honestly states that he doesn't know if he even wants to recover from this latest breakdown, the open hostility shown to Frank by Catherine's father, plus the dynamic encounter between former buddies Frank and Peter Watts are all diamonds in the rough.  Overall it's a weak beginning to the new season where all the rules have changed again - just like at the start of season 2 - and we the viewer are being asked  to start all over once more.  Note: it's in this opening two parter that we are introduced to the murderous Group member Mabius played by Bob Wilde. Wilde had appeared in Millenium before in the season 1 episode Gehenna where he played the demonic cult leader Ricardo Clemmett.

13 Years Later
The filming of a case which Frank once investigated stirs up a whole new batch of murder's with movie-inspired M.O.'s....
Millenium's 2nd Halloween episode lacks the spooky atmosphere of The Curse of Frank Black but is still loads of fun as Frank is almost driven to the 3rd breakdown of his life by the insanity going on all around him.  From the opening 'lecture' which has a great payoff at the episode's end to The Player-like gags of life behind the scenes on a cheap movie set, 13 Years Later is just a joy to watch provided you don't take it all too seriously.
Although the KISS cameo is truly bonkers to say the least, what really makes this story stand out is Marc Bianco (Megan Gallagher's real life husband) the actor playing Fran Black. From Lance Henrickson's hysterical 1st reaction to Bianco's David Hasselhoff-style representation of him to later scenes where he becomes more like the real thing, Bianco is an absolute hoot and 13 Years Later is worth watching for just him alone !

Skull and Bones
The FBI are called to the construction site of a new highway where skeletal remains have been uncovered only to find member's of the Millenium Group already there. Whilst agent Baldwin is all-too quick to accept the information given to him by Peter Watts, Hollis and - via phone - Frank begin to suspect an ulterior motive for the Group's involvment....
The 1st major arc episode of season 3 shows us the Millenium Group at its most insideous as Hollis' eyes are opened wide and clear to the kinds of thing's that they are capable of. The moment Hollis uncovers more remains as Watts watches in the background is chillingly played out, but even that doesn't compare to the scene at the end of the episode when she enters the house of horror's - at this point Millenium has reached truly nightmarish heights that wouldn't be matched on tv until years later in Hannibal. The dialogue that follows between Hollis and Watts marks the beginning of the 'recruitment' subplot that continues throughout the season.  As for Frank himself, his seperate line of enquiry leads him to the obsessive chronicler Ed - someone who over the years has developed an ability not too different from Frank's own gift. Ed is very similar to that other seemingly lone nut who had inportant information to share if only people would listen, Dennis Hoffman from season 1 Force Majeure, which is probably not too suprising seeing as both episodes are written by Chip Johannsen.  At the climax of Skull and Bones, Ed breaks free of his mousy shell and in the proscess inadvertantly saves Frank's life. The final image of him wheeling away his life's work is extremely moving and it's a pity that like Hoffman before him, we'd never get to see this unique character again.
Also although it's great that Cheryl Andrews appears in flashback scenes, her activities in Germany in Skull and Bones fails to fit together with her activities in Germany from season 2's The Hand of Saint Sebastian. This is just 1 of many times that season 3 conveniently forgets what has gone before in order to pursue the show's new direction, eg. in Skull and Bones, Frank refers to Andrews as a friend, incredibly forgetting that in their last encounter she tried to have him killed ! These sloppy lapses in continuity ruin what would otherwise have been a perfect episode.

Omerta
A mafia execution in December 1989 leads to all kind's of magical revelations and legal complications a decade later when Frank and Jordan visit the same area on a seasonal retreat....
This being their 1st Christmas without Catherine, the Black family are in reflective mood throughout this festive cracker which lead to a couple of heartbreaking moments as they both confess to their most hoped-for wish, that thing's could go back to the way they were.  Jon Polito is given the role of his career and in return delivers a fully-fleshed out character who has truly learned from his past misdeeds. What makes Omerta all-the-more overpowering is the beautiful choral music by Mark Snow - it truly lifts the episode into rapterous heights.

Borrowed Time
A number of unexplainable drownings on dry land caused by a mysterious stranger lead Frank and Emma to the discovery that all the victims had previously cheated death. As his own daughter fits into this category, ie. she should've died back in the Pilot then again in The Time Is Now, Frank becomes increasingly desperate to prevent her falling prey to the same fate....
This is an episode full of disturbing and upsetting scenes, from people choking up mouthfull's of water to Jordan herself being forced into an icy bath full of water by her father in order to save her life. Perhaps the most devestating moment though comes in the now-famous scene where Frank begs God to spare his child - rarely has Lance Henrickson shown such raw emotion on screen !  Eric Mabius does a fine job as the 'Angel of Death' come to colllect what is now owed and there has been some speculation that this is the same character last seen in season 1's Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions. Although they both appear to be supernatural beings, wear similar clothes and even have the same name, nothing else is made of this and the viewer is left to come to their own conclusion. The only real problem with Borrowed Time is the climax when Samuel decides to save lives as opposed to taking them. This puzzling turnabout which costs Samuel his own life happens for no apparent reason - perhaps we're supposed to believe that his time on earth was now up as well ?

Collateral Damage
Peter Watt's daughter is kidnapped by a Gulf War veteran who wants the Millenium Group to admit that they used him to test their virus on American soldiers during Operation Desert Storm....
The clock is ticking in an episode which reveals further secret's in the Group's sinister past and see's an internal struggle in Watts as he tries to do the right thing. The idea that the Group used the Gulf War as a testing ground for the modern day plague which they would later release at the end of season 2 is chilling to say the least, as is the torture and execution of kidnapper Swan's accomplice.  The scene between Frank and Watts, their first since Exegesis, is masterfully played by both men on so many different levels - Frank's rage at Watts for having tracked him down and then daring to recite Group propoganda is equally balanced by Watts' attempt to be honest with Frank, which then leads to a rare and desperate plea for help - acting just doesn't get much better than this !  James Marsters also delivers the goods as Swan whose misjudged act of compassion results in his unnecessary death at the hands - literally - of Taylor Watts. Her swift and merciless dispatching of Swan immediantly loses her any sympathy from the viewer, not to mention being completely unbelievable ! Just where did she learn to break neck's so effectively anyway ? Certainly not at her local self defence class that's for sure ! Being the daughter of a Group member doesn't cut it either as the whole point of this episode is that Watts' daughter's have no idea who their father is and what he does for a living.  Collateral Damage could easily be watched back-to-back with Skull and Bones - both episodes demonstrate just how dangerous an organisation can be when it believes that its purpose for being gives it the right to act no matter what the cost.

The Sound of Snow
A deliberately misdirected cassette full of white noise leads Frank back down roads in his past and to personal issues left hanging since his wife's murder....
The only real episode of season 3 that acts as a sequel to events in season 2, The Sound of Snow feels like a reunion of familiar faces and places for the viewer - Catherine, Giebelhouse (this being sadly just 1 of only 2 appearences this season), Frank's former yellow house, the cabin in the woods etc. The scenes between Frank and Giebelhouse really do feel like old workmates getting together again and Giebs' response of , ""Geez Frank, you never don't know !"" shows a weight of familiarity that's been lacking for most of the season. There is also the newly-filmed flashback of Jordan running to get help after her father's breakdown, which acts as a very important bridge between where season 2 ended and where season 3 picked thing's up again. The most striking scene of all though has to be the opening teaser and the girl's hallucination of a silent snowy stretch of road which very quickly becomes an icy deathtrap. Note: after this episode Frank's hair is completely white again. Is this a result of Frank having to relive the painful events surrounding Catherine's death - which is of course what turned his hair white the first time around ? Apart from the background rain which ruins alot of the all-important dialogue between Frank and Catherine this is one of the seasons best episodes, with a truly beautiful final shot of Catherine fading away into golden lit woods of falling snow.

Antipas
Lucy Butler returns once again and sets in motion a chain of events that will bring her face to face with Frank again - who she has intimate plans for....
By pretty much bypassing season 2's A Room With No View, Antipas acts as a direct sequel to season 1's Lamentation. Sarah Jane Redmond has never been stronger and dominates every scene she's in, holding her own against Lance Henrickson in all of their electric confrontations. Antipas has some frightening imagery too, wether it's of giant snakes devouring little girl's, dog's attacking or Butler's long-haired man alter ego jusr standing in silent menace. Emma Hollis has her first real run in with the forces of evil in this episode as opposed to the evil actions of the Millenium Group and as a result rightly plays those scenes looking unsure of herself and out of her depth. She does get to be her more confident self in her dealings with Butler's parasitic lawyer, who does a wonderful job of winding Frank up. This is also the first time that Frank pulls a Group-style tactic of leaving Hollis out of the loop when he innitially wrestles the case from her without revealing his reasons why - sadly it won't be the last time he does this. Lucy Butler's final threat to Frank concerning Jordan nicely sets thing's up for Saturn Dreaming of Mercury.

Matryoshka
The suicide of an elderly ex FBI agent and the words 'It Must End' written on an old photo of a young girl lead Frank and Emma back over 50 years to the rebirth of the Millenium Group....
Even though this episode is similar to The X-Files' Travellers, Matryoshka is still an important piece in the overall arc for a number of reasons. To begin with we finally get to see how the FBI connection to the Group came about, in the proscess giving the ancient organisation acsess, cover, recruitment and ultimately a new sense of direction and purpose in the latter half of the 20th century. Then there's Peter Watts who has many telling scenes throughout - the 'recruitment' subplot of Hollis takes its next step here, plus his dealings with former Group member Barbara Bains and the Group Elder reveal much about the man himself including his feelings over having lost Frank from the Group. On a smaller level, we have the welcome return of the onscreen Group logo which hasn't been seen since the end of season 2. There is a huge continuity error though. In this episode we're shown that it was J. Edgar Hoover who came up with the Uroboros symbol for the Group - wrong ! Season 2's The Hand of Saint Sebastian clearly shows that Group members were already using the symbol 1000 years earlier having tatood it upon their bodies. The ending of Matryoshka packs a heavy punch for the girl in the photo. All grown up now and a member of the Group, she's left with the realisiation that she's spent her whole life continuing the very work that led to her father's death.

Forcing the End
A pregnant woman is kidnapped by a Jewish sect intent on raising her baby as a priest in the soon to be rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem....
This is very much Hollis' episode as the 'recruitment' subplot moves up a gear by having her for the 1st time follow the advice given to her by Peter Watts, much to the concern of Frank who warns Hollis that there will be a price to pay for such help - something he knows only too well !  It's not too suprising to hear from Watts that Gourevitch was once an alli of the Group, as the rebuilding of the Temple is just the kind of enterprise that they would be involved with. What is of interest though is Watts rescuing the mother but not the baby due to his belief that a specific section of the Book of Revelations was about to be fulfilled and therefore had to play itself out. Mark Snow's music also adds the appropiate flavour to an episode that not only contains a graphic stoning but a tense helicopter finale too. Note: because the Jewish idea of the Messiah differs greatly from the christian there are a few minor errors that stand out - Jews aren't awaiting the Messiah's return as they don't believe he has come at all yet plus the year 2000 has no real significance to Jews, so the sect in this episode wouldn't be trying to rebuild the Temple for that particular date.

Saturn Dreaming of Mercury
Frank becomes concerned over his daughter's growing obsession toward their new neighbours, which is a result of Jordan having frightening visions of an explosive house fire and a demonic parent....
The beginning of the so-called 7 episode story arc that was all suppose to lead somewhere - and didn't ! - this is a curious sequel to Antipas. Even though the various storylines from that episode are followed through here, Lucy Butler going after Jordan as she had threatened to and Frank continuing to keep thing's from Hollis, Saturn Dreaming of Mercury fails to get its act together until its inferno climax. The image of the contorting Butler/Lucas is extremely disturbing, making sure that one of the shows best recurring character's goes out in a blaze of glory at least. PLus the realisation by Hollis that she's missing out on thing's is perfectly played by Klea Scott. It's also interesting to watch Brittany Tiplady as Jordan, who is required throughout to carry a number of scenes all by herself - something which for the most part she does very well.

Bardo Thodal
The discovery of a cargo of frozen hands by Hollis during a 'routine raid' and a cryptic message which appears on Frank's computer when he downloads one of Jordan's games, lead the 2 down seperate paths concerning a genetic researcher who has defected from the Millenium Group....
The use of the monks and some of the teachings from the Buddhist beliefs help to give this episode a unique feeling and perspective. It's also the biggest role to date for Mabius who actually gets a few lines of dialogue for the first time since Exegesis as he goes about his murderous Group business. The Group itself ups its ante in their recruitment of Hollis by deliberately making sure she's left to figure thing's out for herself during her investigation, which all leads to her wonderful fiery rage against Watts. ""Hey, bald man !"" , has got to be the best line of the season for sure ! Even though I failed to understand the importance of the ancient bowls to the Group I still think this is a highly recommended episode. The onscreen warning of , ""We are moving towards an apocalypse of our own creation"" and the continuous use of the words , ""Understand and you are liberated"" were both very effective. As too is the final scene which makes use of the snowy mountain location last seen in season 1's Lamentation and in doing so provides a reflective and enlightening close.
Note: the arrangement of the body of the genetic researcher by the Monks is strikingly similar to that of the Old Man's back in the season 2 episode  Roosters.
Plus the words spoken to the dying geneticist by James Hong's monk are all from the TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD - which for anybody interested is what the title of this episode means.

Seven and One
Frank is the prime suspect in his own investigation when he becomes the target of yet another Polaroid Man - or so it 1st appears....
This is an incredibly lazy and stupid episode which is more than happy to recycle previous storylines ! Therefore it's just the same old deal played out 1 time too many, ie. the forces of evil attacking Frank and those close to him in an attempt to once again push him over the edge. The unnecessary morphing of the evil agent Boxer into Mabius only makes thing's worse and confuses the overall issue - is this Group member really a devil in disguise then or what ? This is just 1 of many things that happen in Seven and One which are never dealt with again - the investigation of Frank by agent Boxer and McClaren's line to Hollis that Frank is leaving the FBI and is never coming back are all just left hanging at the end. Worse than all of this are some truly apalling continuity errors. In their 1st meeting Frank tells Boxer that the original Polaroid Man - who we know from the pilot was Ed Cuffle - is dead. This comes as something of a shock then when Ed Cuffle turns up alive and well, though not for long, at the beginning of the later episode Via Dolarosa ! Then in Frank's watery flashback he tells a story to Hollis that involves his brother's - what brother's ! He only has one as seen in season 1's Sacrament and confirmed in the obituary seen in season 2's Midnight of the Century !!! So despite the odd good visual like Frank having some major plumbing problems and Hollis seeing double, plus the great moment when Frank flips out after recieving a letter from Seattle and order's a quarantine of the surrounding area; this is the worst episode ever by Carter and Spotnitz who deserve their very own Millenium Group-style execution for daring to cheat the viewer out of 45 minutes of their lives which could've been better spent than watching this rubbish !
The closing voiceover by Lance Henrickson was so empty and vacous that I actually lost the will to live whilst listening to it - compare it to his wonderful voiceover in season 2's The Beginning and the End - perhaps Lance's rushed reading was down to the fact that he himself was bored with this awful episode and just wanted it over and done with as quickly as possible !

Via Dolarosa/Goodbye to All That
The state execution of the original Polaroid Man followed by a series of copycat murder's, the ongoing deterioration of James Edward Hollis, plus the end game actions of the Millenium Group forever change the lives of all those involved as the 3 year odyssey of Frank Black draws to a close....
The Alzheimer's storyline which began in Darwin's Eye manages to tie into the ongoing 'recruitment subplot' as Hollis turns on Frank in order to save her father. This painful but inevitable betrayal is down to the Group forcing her hand as they set about placing her in a position of power at the FBI. The presence of the Group is everywhere throughout this 2 parter - it is they who are behind the creation of the Ed Cuffle 'clone' as well as the murder of agent Baldwin which clears the way for Hollis' promotion. For the 1st time in the whole season Baldwin is presented as a half-decent human being and half-competent FBI agent. This character turnaround is obviously down to the writer's wanting his death to carry some impact, but this can only be achieved if you gave a damn about the character to begin with ! Perhaps if Peter Outerbridge had been given this kind of range to play with in earlier episodes instead of just an unconditional jerk it might've worked, but it's a case of too little too late I'm afraid. The guy deserved better ! Another character whose usefulness seems to be at an end is Peter Watts and the scene when his Group acsess is terminated genuinely made me feel for a man who over the season became nothing more than a lackey errand boy ! However Chris Carter pulls his usual stunt when offing somebody by deliberatley leaving their death ambiguous. No doubt if Millenium had continued for another season Watts somehow would've been resurrected. And finally we come to Frank himself. The man has clearly had enough of it all and other people's bullplop. Wether that be McClaran and his constant refusal to act against the Group, backstabber Hollis, or ex-buddy Watts - who despite everything may well be the only real friend Frank has left. In one of the best moments of seaon 3, Frank almost follows through on his threat to Watts concerning Jordan from back in Exegesis. Many people have commented that the Frank Black that Chris Carter created would never have committed such an emotional outburst. Well that Frank had Catherine and his Yellow house and a deep respect for the MIllenium Group - all of which helped to center him. But that Frank Black is long gone now, cut loose and left to drift dangerously out of control following much personal loss and treacherous deceit. Ultimately though it's Watts' final act of friendship and warning which although probably costs him his life gives Frank and Jordan the chance of escape and the opportunity of a fresh start together. However ignoring the fact that this is an anticlimactic finish to both the season and the show as a whole what really spoils this 2 parter more than anything is a huge dose of ripping off ! The situation Watts finds himself in is just a replay of The X-Files' Cigarette Smoking Man and his own predicament in season 5 episode Redux 2, ie. CSM's protection of that series' main character has put him at odds with the other members of his group which results in him being cut out of their activities followed by the old ambiguous dispatching. This is only minor though compared to the excessive plagiarizing from the film Manhunter - who's main character Frank Black was heavily copied from anyway. Just check out the list of similarities between that film and this season 2 part finale: serial killer uses night vision goggles as he parades around his victims houses, serial killer watches his victims via video as his blind girlfiriend sits nearby completely unaware, plus the striking image of the profiler hero bursting through a window. It's nothing short of a miracle that Michael Mann didn't sue ! With a moving closing scene we wave goodbye then - well not quite, as Frank Black still has one more appearence to make.

X-Files Episode 'Millenium' - to be found on extras menu
Following on from the events of the season 3 finale the Millenium Group have mysteriously disbanded leaving no traces behind of any of its members. All except a splinter faction of 4 who have taken their own lives and now with the aid of a necromancer intend on forcing the end of the world themselves. Given the task of investigating these suicides and the subsequent dissapearences of all 4 bodies, plus because of the FBI connection of most Group members, are agents Mulder and Scully - who with just days remaining until the dawn of the new millenium turn to the 1 person who may hold all the answers concerning the Millenium Group, Frank Black....
After the happy ending shown in the closing moments of season 3 it's sad to see, though not too suprising, that Frank's world has once again turned to crap. Involved in a nasty custody battle for Jordan with the parents of his late wife, he has signed himself into the nearest nuthouse for evaluation in order to prove he's still a fit father. All of this of course makes it very easy for Mulder and Scully to track him down, but because of Frank's current situation he's more than abit reluctant to get involved in anything concerning the Millenium Group. Ultimately though Frank realises that no matter what he does he just can't escape his former colleagues and the fallout from their activities. The scene when he chooses to once again risk all that he holds dear in order to do the right thing and make 1 final stand against the Group is a supreme example of Frank's self-less nature as well as a beautifully and typically underplayed moment by Lance Henrickson. Also it's highly unlikely that the Group itself has simply disbanded so close to the actual millenium but instead have gone underground again as they did 1000 years ago to avoid any unwanted attention and to ensure its own survival - see The Hand of Saint Sebastian. Quite what the Group's thinking in this episode is I haven't a clue. After all if a biological plague didn't bring about the end of the world how 4 Group members are going to pull of the the feat by turning everybody else into zombies is anyone's guess. A couple of cleverly written exchanges between Mulder and Scully and their boss Skinner manage to sum up key points concerning the history of the Group and Frank's life over the last 3 seasons - for all those folks unfamiliar with the show and to act as a neat bonus of rare continuity for all those who are. Other top scenes include Frank's encounter with the necromancer, plus Frank and Mulder fighting off the zombiefied Group members whilst trapped in their basement layer - a knowing nod to the Evil Dead movies. However there is definately a case of missed opportunity concerning Scully's tatoo - which is of the Uroborus ! This could've been used as a major plot device within the story or at the very least as a passing gag between Scully and Frank. The only major downer though comes in the episodes final moments as the countdown to 2000 finally arrives and Frank and Jordan - reunited at last - are all-too quickly shoved offscreen just so Mulder and Scully can get jiggy with each other ! What the hell kind of social services gives child custody back to a parent on the eve of a new millenium anyway, is truly beyond me ! At the end of the day it's important to remember that this is an episode of The X-Files and that Frank Black and all things Millenium-related only really appear in that particular context. Even so this crossover does provide a more fitting and stronger close to Millenium than the feeble season 3 finale, recreating some of the apocalyptic urgency of season 2 and making sure that Millenium itself did eventually reach the big 2000.

2334481,5,B0009X76XW,"I remember watching 1 episode and being pretty lost and never giving it another shot.  In fact it was the smart syndication of Fox with X-files that led me to that show that I ended up completely loving.  Fox you blew it by not putting Millenium into reruns sooner, and I am sorry I didn't give it a shot.  Somehow turning the channels I see this weird channel called ""Chiller"" and the show Millenium, and think my god I saw one episode many years ago, for nostalgic reasons I watched it.  I am so sorry I hadn't watched it back when it really needed an audience to keep it going at least for another year or 2.

I totally disagree about the X-Files movie and its failure, they Fox gave them a 30 million dollar budget unheard of these days, and barely any money for promoting the film, they needed a huge film not a movie of the week style that Carter choose.  The first movie back in 1998 was just that a movie, not just another darned episode.  Fox you cheapo's give X-Files a real budget, ""Carter"" stop being a hog with the directing, I know he has passed away but Kim Manners was better at directing, you need to gather the team back together and make an EPIC film, the 2012 mythology is RIPE.  and you need to tell us what the heck was so special about ""William"" and we want to see them as a family again.

Millenium, Carter and Fox....now you hand over the 30 million budget for a Millenium movie and you will more than make your money back, no offense my fellow Americans but X-Files the movie made 70 million but it was mostly from the rest of the worlds love for it not our own.  Millenium has a huge following to...more so since it ended, and Lance Henrikson has quite the following all by himself to make you plenty of money on a Millenium Film...Please make it.

Heck go back to repeats of Xfiles/Millenium on more prominent times and channels than ScyFy 2a.m. Xfiles...only time you can find it anymore...and 6a.m. 6p.m. Millenium on the Chiller channel...give them more exposure and then talk films again...promise you some thrilled people and lots of money to be made.  Make sure Lance Henriksen and Gillian Anderson go to ""Comic and Wonder Cons"" too.

2334482,3,B0009X76XW,"Millennium now resides firmly placed in the top 5 of my all-time favorite TV series. Seasons 1 and 2 are flat out amazing, each in a different way (See my reviews). Unfortunately, season 3 just doesn't measure up to the same level of excellence.

Upon completing this experience, here are my observations:

1) I think there should have been a season 4 and that the writers were in fact planning for one. The whole development of the Emma Hollis character would have made more sense and probably ended differently. Same for the Peter Watts character.

2) There are still some very good episodes like Omerta, Collateral Damage, Antipas, Saturn Dreaming of Mercury and Bardo Thodol, amongst others. That's not the problem with season 3.

3) The lack of a cohesive and focused story arc in season 3 is the problem. In this respect, the show seems off-kilter and Frank Black's purpose a bit less focused. I think Chris Carter, who returned as a creative presence for this season, just couldn't get a handle on where he wanted the show to go. He must have had a hard time justifying/expanding his vision of Millenium (from Season 1) with the reality of what it had become after season 2.

Overall. I still love this TV series a lot. It is probably the one show that has left me with the most vivid images. I will definitely be rewatching Millennium.",1263859200,,1343,4.649789029535865
2334483,3,B0009X76XW,"I didn't start watching Millennium until it was already fresh into reruns.  However, if the first episodes I had started watching were all from season 3, I would never have made it to seasons 1 and 2.  I recently got this boxset and halfway through I'm dreading the remaining episodes.  One of the biggest problems is the Agent Hollis character.  She is quite the wet blanket and for a supposed FBI Special Agent for 5 years (you find out a bit of her history in one of the episodes off the first disc I think), she's awfully insecure, naive, and overly sensitive.  In the episode ""Closure"", the girlfriend of the killing spree guy says to Agent Hollis ""you're not cut out for this job""(or something similar) and she was dead on.  This season would have been much better if they could have written the Lara Means character back into the thread; at least Ms. ""Here's my thing..."" wasn't annoying every time she was on screen.

Additionally, ""...THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"" gets the ""worst episode ever"" award.  I don't get it... a tongue-in-cheek holiday thriller episode used to explain the origins of Frank Black's breakdown 13 years prior?  Wow, what a horrible way to fill in a backdrop for a major point in the lead character's personal history and reason for leaving the FBI and working with the Millennium group.  I even like KISS and this still is the worst episode also because they succeeded in making it as annoying and boring as a typical made-for-teens predictable horror/slasher flick.

And seriously, what's with the choice for the actor portraying Assistant Director Andy McClaren?  I think they hired a G. W. Bush impersonator for this guy.  I guess that's kinda realistic though, as a lot of people who you wouldn't expect to deserve it end up getting elevated to a position of being in charge of others.  The other reviewer who mentioned that dialogue between McClaren and Black is predictably the same is right, too.

Season 1 was good and Season 2 is my absolute favorite.  Apparently a lot of critics and ""fans"" rejected the tone and direction of the stories in season 2, but I thought they were the most fascinating and balanced.  Instead of ultimately making a Millennium movie, I'd rather they just try to negotiate getting a couple more seasons of this show, and keep it in the vein of season 2.  The last X-Files movie was apparently a failure and I think a Millennium movie wouldn't be so great either, because it couldn't possibly wrap up all the things that made season 2 great into a neat little 2 hour package.",1259452800,,2535,4.6968325791855206

It's sad that something so well written and unique has to be shot down by a lack of viewership, and the result was Season 3...

The third season was more like the first, but simply lacked the energy of the first two seasons.  It seemed muted, and hinted at issues from Season 2 that were major, and could not (and should not) have been ignored.  The overall strange and disconnected feeling changes the way I view the show, but the reality is that it's still very well written - and very much ahead of it's time.  If you liked Season 1, then you will like Season 3.  If you enjoyed the direction Season 2 went, then you will still like this third Season, but will not enjoy it as much.

Namely, a huge plague seemed to be wiping out all of humanity, that kind of puts a low emphasis on the importance of catching serial-killers.

However, it's now Frank Black working for the FBI and the Millenium Group lurking about in the shadows. Makes for good conflict. The new star Klea Scott is a likeable charater; the Scully to Frank Black's Mulder. The pair also do a great job with the commentary for a few of the episodes.

The set is well worth the purchase even if you're worried about the turn the series took after season 2. I can say with confidence that things pick up and it becomes more like season 1.

2334502,3,B0009X76XW,"Chris Carter wanted to prove he could do it again.  Fox TV was hoping for another cash cow.  Carter was determined to do something that was *not* the X-Files.  Millenium was launched, and from the beginning it was hard to tell what, exactly, the series was about.

Each of the three seasons has a distinct identity.  The first season is (mostly) an unremittingly grim serial-killer-of-the-week series, with people being set on fire, having their eyes sewn shut, and other atrocities.  The show survived because of the moral center provided by Frank Black, who has journeyed into the heart of evil and was almost consumed by it.  Retired from the FBI and recruited into the Millenium group, an association of former law enforcement officers, Frank is forced to protect his wife and daughter from the evil around them.

Carter closely supervised the first season and was careful to avoid explicit references to the supernatural.  This was *not*, he repeated, *not* the X-Files.  But even in the first season, the producers couldn't refrain from introducing a fantastic element, although in very small doses.

Many of the plots were incoherent and only partly explained; but we were used to this because of the X-Files.

In the second season, Carter turned to series over to producers Morgan and Wong, who took the show in very interesting directions.  The Millenium Group is now revealed to be a conspiracy, itself divided by a struggle between religious and scientific camps.  Both fear a coming apocalypse in 2000 and are in fact working to bring it about.

Just as the show was really becoming interesting, with a dramatic conclusion to Season 2, Carter returned to the show, unhappy with the direction Morgan and Wong had taken it.  Instead of picking up where Season 2 left off, Season 3 tosses out much of the continuity and starts over, with Frank Black now back at the FBI teamed with a female partner.  But oh no, it's *not* the X-Files!

Season 3 is easily the worst season of this promising show.  My biggest complaint is that many episodes are simply incoherent.  Fantastic things happen, but nothing --- and I mean absolutely nothing --- is explained.  It's one giant McGuffin after another.  The style and flash are still there, but it's become a poor man's X-Files, without the fun and the humor.

It's hard to say where Carter would have taken the show had it survived, but it's clear that he couldn't do what he'd sworn to do: create a show that was completely different from the X-Files.

It's not surprising this show was cancelled; each season has a different identity, it's almost entirely lacking in humor, and it's dark, bloody, brooding, and grim.  However its high production values and excellent acting (especially from Lance Henriksen, as Frank Black) earned the show a devoted cult following.

I bought Season 3 when it came out and still haven't watched the last four episodes.  With the Season 2 set, I watched the whole thing in one week.  That's how disappointing Season 3 is: you're set up for an intriguing mystery in 1 and 2; then Chris Carter comes back and says, ""Oh, never mind.  Let's just clone the X-Files.""

It's a shame.  This show could have been so much better, if someone had ever decided once and for all what is was supposed to be about.",1164412800,23,3283,4.788256227758007
2334503,4,B0009X76XW,"Millenium...Ah, where to begin.  This show had all the potential in the world and for two seasons it realized said potential more and more.

The first season of Millenium, which was overseen by Chris Carter, was brilliant.  It was a grim, dark drama unlike any before seen on television.
Season two saw the reins given over to the production team of Glen Morgan and James Wong, who served as production consultants on the first season.  In my opinion season two is definitely the standout.  We learn much more about the Millenium Group and we see a good number of compelling episodes.

Apparently Chris Carter, upon seeing the season after it aired, was displeased with the work on season 2.  You are an idiot Chris Carter.  He could've come back to save the show on season 3, or he could've let Morgan and Wong continue and I think this show would've kept going, in my opinion season 3 was an ugly duckling, far worse than the two preceeding seasons.  Chip Johanssen produced a season that saw show quality go up and down by never before.  Klea Scott, brought on to serve as Frank's partner in the FBI, did not do a very good job.  Someone pointed out that her and Baldwin did not make for good FBI agents, I strictly concur.  With the introduction of these new characters, well-liked, and REAL characters like Det. Geibelhouse were relatively nowhere to be seen.  I believe he was in 2 episodes.  Lame.  This season does have its moments, particularly in the episodes Antipas and the 2 episode conclusion but other than that I was extremely disappointed with this season.

I lament the cancellation of Millenium all the time, the 4th season was poised for greatness as we would've seen Frank's experience as the Millenium drew close and finally happened.  Instead we got a crappy season 3 and a terrible concluding X-Files episode.  Seeing Jordan running in at the end of that episode and seeing them runnign away at the end of season 3 both make me teary eyed as to what could've been.  I'm a geeky fanboy, what can I say...

Anyways, definitely get seasons 1 and 2 first before getting this one, you'll enjoy it because Frank is in it, however, he is in it a lot less that previous seasons and as I said, I feel it is by far the weakest of the three.  I gave it four stars because though it wasn't nearly as good as the first two seasons, it is still better than most TV out there today and infinitely better than the atrocious final season of X-Files (Carter's other show which lasted nine seasons).  If you do like this, however, and have never seen X-Files then I urge you to check out the first 4 seasons as it also is some of the strongest work I have ever seen on television.

take care,

2334504,5,B0009X76XW,"This history of this series, along with many others, is living evidence that television executives don't give a damn about artistic merit, and haven't for a long time. The third season of Millennium was still drawing a loyal following, thus making it a profitable member of the Fox weekday lineup. But apparently it didn't make ENOUGH profit to satisfy the fat cats at Fox.

This show deserved a longer run. Yes, the seasons and the episodes within them were wildly variable in quality and tone. But even at its worst, it never failed to compel. The revolving door on the casting room contributed somewhat to the unevenness of quality, but departing characters/actors were never replaced by anything less than excellent actors. Reviewers on this site who claim they never believed Klea Scott as Agent Emma Hollis didn't see the same series I did. Only one performance has been diminished, and that was only by the accidents of history--Frank's and Emma's boss is unintentionally funny at times because of the striking resemblance beween him and George Bush in appearance, manner--and unfortunately, in intellectual savvy as well.

I have never seen X-Files, so allusions and comparisons to Chris Carter's other work mean nothing to me. However, as a consequence, I have the advantage of being able to consider this program solely on its own merits. There are two components to this series that make it so compelling, no matter what direction it was taken, week after week--Lance Henriksen and the character of Frank Black. Every week Henriksen presented a living example of what the best dramatic acting should be; there is only a handful of dramatic actors working today that can immerse themselves so thoroughly in a character that the audience forgets that they're acting, and Henriksen is one of the best of those. The character himself is one of the most complex to ever grace the television screen--there is layer upon layer to his personality, so many layers, in fact, that we never completely know Frank. It is this complexity that kept me tuning in week after week and the reason why I watched all the episodes in fairly close succession. Without Henriksen's restrained underplaying, this series would have been nothing more than an exercise in gore and dark weirdness week after week.

I hope the bottom-line oriented honchos at Fox wake up and realize that they still have a potential blockbuster on their hands in the form of a motion picture based on this series. Lance Henriksen isn't getting any younger. Without him, the film wouldn't be worth making. What are you waiting for, gentlemen?!?!",1153440000,4,2607,4.988505747126437

2334506,5,B0009X76XW,"A die-hard fan of Millennium and a loyal viewer from the show's inception, like many others, discovering that the series came to an end after only three years, was a terrible disappointment. This unique series failed to reach a wider audience, however, managed to sustain a core following. This could be one reason the Fox Network cancelled it, nonetheless, most fans would agree, Millennium could have credibly continued for at least two more seasons.

To compare each season is difficult, as each year had its own signature, the teams' writers taking the show in new directions. In season 1, Frank Black is a consultant for the Millennium Group, a vague organization with unlimited resources, aiding the FBI on their more bizarre and difficult cases. It is in this season that we see the utter insanity and evil that the human being is capable of. Frank Black's gift is the ability to enter the consciousness of evil, therefore making it less difficult to track the offender down and bring them to justice. Never the less, by the end of the first season, the series begins to turn in a strange direction, hinting at the supernatural, demonology, and the esoteric. It is also hinted that the Group is not exactly what it seems.

Season 2 dives head long into the esoteric/occult, pushing the boundaries of this genre, which had never been seen portrayed to such extremes on mainstream television. My favourite episode would have to be ""Anamnesis"", expertly written by Erin Maher and Kay Reindl, and directed by John Peter Kousakis. This episode, well before the publication of ""The Da Vinci Code"", addresses the legend of Mary Magdalene and the Holy Bloodline of the Grail. A little girl and her friends have witnessed the manifestation of Mary in their local church and the whole town is up in arms, claiming demonic possession. The little girl quotes lines from Gnostic scripture (directly from the Gospel of Mary) and owns a statue of the mysterious Black Virgin. The season ends with a supposed pandemic, a contagious virus sweeping its way across the United States. Is this end of the world?

Season 3 changes again, returning back to the original atmosphere of the show and the type of stories told. Frank Black no longer works for the Millennium Group; in fact he blames the group for creating the virus, which killed hundreds of people including his beloved wife. He is back with the FBI with a new partner, no longer investigating the occult but vicious serial killers and the Millennium Groups' involvement in major crimes and conspiracies to create Armageddon by the new millennium. Black is raging a one-man war against the Group as no one can see the connections between a multitude of strange deaths and unexplained events.

Although the show blasted off in many directions throughout its three-year life, the character of Frank Black managed to maintain his integrity. Season's 1, 2 and 3 are all well crafted shows thoroughly researched with exciting and adeptly written scripts.

The last episode, ""Good-Bye to All That"", almost wrapped the series up, but cleverly leaves a few unanswered questions, leaving it open for more...a possible feature film?  Millennium was arguably one of the best shows of the nineties.",1149120000,3,3233,4.955719557195572
2334507,4,B0009X76XW,"Season 3 lacked the creative visions of Morgan and Wong, and this season took the show back to a more 'x-files' format - FBI agents investigating 'weird' happenings - and put the Millennium group mythology on the backburner. To some - including myself - that was a mistake, BUT the show was still an excellent series. This DVD includes extras, such as the 'making of season 3', that have chris carter's insights into HIS vision of where this series should go. Unfortunately, Millennium never developed more than a loyal cult following, and never saw the success of the x-files, but them again, it was never really given a chance.

Overall, season 3 tries to tie together some of the aspects of season 2, but it distances itself from the Group mythology that Morgan and Wong developed in Season 2. The atmosphere is still dark, and the acting is still superb, but it is missing that magic that we saw in season 2.",1140480000,4,912,4.62962962962963
2334508,5,B0009X76XW,"Season Three is just as strong as season one. The production values are high and the quality is very high; in this respect it stands up to , as they say on the special  features disc 6, about 90% of current movies, and very much so in TV/cable. Chris Carter notes that he was left with a different creature than what he created in the original concept of MILLENNIUM. What we basically have in season 3 is a hybrid of seasons  1 and 2, but it goes several steps further.
The Amazon editorial comments are, i feel, once again wide of the mark. Makes me feel that they never watch the series, or even liked it. And it is A very good  set.
The DVD is packaged well, with some good commentaries, good extras, and great quality Video and audio; plus some great insight into the academy group.
Out of 22 ""official"" episodes, not counting the bonus X-FILES  season 7 episode which is included, the  first two are one story, as are the last two. Some commentary seems to downplay the first 8 episodes, and say that the season does not really start until the episode OMERTA, however, the double header that starts the series is great, with an excellent introduction to ""Emma"", and Klea is Superb in this role... the only other comparable actress in my view at the moment is Sanaa  Lathan ( starred in AVP).
The commentary  by Lance and Klea on episode  one is very useful, and tells  a lot without revealing later details.
Contrary to previous comments, the Nature of the MILLENNIUM group is NOT stated in Season two, but it is very clearly stated in this season, as is this nature of the relationship between Frank and Peter Watts. Lance's insights through the
commentary are very useful in understanding his take on the series, but it does not  interfere with the great  performances.
The KISS Performance is a Halloween  show, and whilst it is more on a par with the Donut shop Demons  from Season 2, it still has a high quality.
The SKULL AND BONES episode is, I feel, pivotal, since ""Emma""  gets to see things that Frank ""Knows. And the obvious hint at the ""society"" is rather intriguing.
Overall, the development of the Mythology works well, with the hybrid of Season 1 and 2 producing some great Dark elements, and some superb work. The Denoument of the series, a double header, is brilliant, and places some elements in the darkest realms, with a ""checkmate or else"" type of feel.
The Commentaries are good, except that the commentary for COLLATERAL is mostly  technical, and is effectively useless
within the context of the show... little enlightenment, and sounds like the commentary you have when not having a
commentary. ""Lucy Butler"" as a character is taken to a whole new level ... very significant. Overall, I agree with Lance that Chris Carter is sitting on a Goldmine with the possibility of a MILLENNIUM film still very viable.",1139356800,,2835,4.6195219123505975
2334509,5,B0009X76XW,"It's funny.  About 1/3 of the way through Season 1 I said to my wife, this is just too grim... I can't watch anymore.  I think that was after the episode with the guy who burned a priest alive. I was disappointed because I really identified with Lance Henriksen's Frank Black character (wanting to protect my own wife and daughter from the evils of this world).

Then I heard they were going to tone things down for Season 2, I became a Millennium junkie.  I revisited Season 1 and it seems they started backing off the gore just about the time I stopped watching.  I loved Season 2 and just couldn't see how Carter was going to pick up the pieces left behind by Morgan and Wong.  (see my Season 2 review).

Season 3 is rather like a blend of Seasons 1 and 2. You get the straight ahead crime stories interspersed with more evil Millennium types and Peter Watts' soul searching about the nature of the group.  Klea Scott is a welcome addition to the cast and plays off Lance very well, especially in the season opener.  The Halloween episode featuring Kiss is hilarious.  The story line involves a movie production about one of Frank's cases.  Watch while the lead actor evolves from a Sonny Crockett type character (Miami Vice) into Frank Black.  The guy nails Henriksen's voice perfectly.  I nearly died laughing at this one, especially the final encounter between Frank and the actor portraying him for the movie in production.  That particular episode was nearly as good as Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense from Season 2 - one of the funniest hours of television ever.

For those paying close attention, there is an espisode involving Agent Hollis' cousin and bad heroin (I forget the title) that has a bit of a collision with the X-Files universe.  There is a scene where Hollis is walking down the hallway of an apartment building in Vancouver and inside one of the apartments you can hear Scully talking to Mulder and, if I recall correctly, she even uses his name.  Of course later in the year, Frank Black turned up on an X-Files episode.  A bit odd that.

Most of Season 3 brings you the same high-quality writing, acting, and cinematic direction and shooting as Seasons 1 & 2. By the time I got to disk 5 it seemed like this season was struggling to find its footing.  The stories are a little more hit-and-miss toward the end of the season though the performances and direction are still excellent. Millennium is quite simply one of the finest series in the history of American television.  If you have Seasons 1 & 2, then you have to go for Season 3.",1136678400,5,2560,4.557986870897155
2334510,5,B0009X76XW,"Let me start by saying that Millennium is one of the best Tv shows in history, i enjoyed all three seasons, especially the unique and superior first season.

I first heard of Millennium back in the 90s when it first aired on TV, but i never had the chance to see it, now years later and thanks to DVDs, i was able to watch the entire show on DVD uncut.

All three seasons were good Tv material and very unique and distinguished from any other show being aired on Tv, very dark and gloomy with an amazing cast and plot twists.

SEASON 1 :
Season one was by far the best of the three seasons, and as we all know it started with Frank moving to Seatlle with his family and joining the Millennium group, invistigating dark murders and profiling serial killers.
I enjoyed season one pretty much, and i was immediatley addicted to the show, and as one mentioned before that it was a show in which each episode was a shorter version of the movie seven ! however, it was even better !
Lance Henrikson was great as Frank black, he palyed the role perfectly, so did Megan who played his wife Catherine, so acting was superb in the first season.
The plot of each episode was so well organized and filled with surprises and twists. the atmosphere was also great, very darkish and depressing (in a good way).
97% of the episodes were great and super,and only one or two episodes were sort of average.

SEASON 2 :
Going to season 2, for me it was less enjoyable than season 1, but still was pretty much entertaining, it took a wide turn and deviated from the killer of the week show of season 1 to a more of Frank's envolvement with the Millennium group, and was more of a religious type of show.
For me i enjoyed the serial killers type of show of season one more than the religious show of S2.
Another let back of S2, was the introduction of Lara Means, the psychologist who was paired with Frank, The thing is that it wasn't clear whats her role in the show was, and i just didn't like the whole thing of her seeing Angels.
However, S2 did have some good points, like Peter Watts character was more pronounced, more matured and more involved in the show.
And one of the best things of S2 was the Holiday episodes ( The curse of frank black AND midnight of the century ) were very touching.
35% of S2 episodes were super, 45% were average and 20% were sort of below average.

SEASON 3 :
the problem with season 3 is that it had no clear definition, no clear identity.
I mean it wasn't like S2 and it wasn't like S1 either, it was like something in between, although alot more like S1.
However, S3 was still pretty much enjoyable for the most part.
It concentrated mainly on Frank's anger towards the group and him trying to expose them and of what they really are.
Again Frank was paired with a new partner Agent Emma hollis played by Klea scot, Klea does a good job as Emma, however i wish if the role was casted for someone more fit and a little cuter ! :)
Episodes were mostly average 65%. with only 20% being super and 15% bieng terrible.
This season has one of the worst episodes in the show (Matryoshka and Bardo Thodol) just Terrible. others like (White noise, Darwin's eye and Nostalgia) were amongst the best.
The two finalle episodes were also great, although they left us without closure.

Overall :
The show is just great and is worth all the time and the money for watching and enjoying it. So go ahead and Enjoy !

Ratings :
Season one 10\10
season two 8\10
season three 8.5\10

2334511,4,B0009X76XW,"Created by Chris Carter, ""Millennium"" first appeared on television in 1996. It stars Lance Henriksen as Frank Black who, as a FBI Agent, specialised in profiling serial killers. After suffering a breakdown, Frank retired from the Bureau and moved from Washington to Seattle. To help with the bills, he joined a team of ex-law enforcement agents known as the ""Millennium Group"". Initially, this arrangement suited Frank perfectly. The Group would lend their expertise, as consultants, to whatever investigation requires their help. Naturally, given Frank's experience, the bulk of his work initially focussed on suspected serial killers. The focus of the show changed entirely, however, when Carter passed control of the show's second season to Glen Morgan and James Wong. Conspiracies appeared everywhere, while the Millennium Group suddenly became a devious, manipulative organisation - its role in fighting crime nothing more than a front. Season Two culminated in the death of Frank's wife, Catherine, from a disease developed and released by the Group.

Carter thankfully returned for Season Three, allowing for the welcome departure of Morgan and Wong. However, there were certain elements of the second season that couldn't be ignored - most notably, Catherine's death and what the Millennium Group had become. As Season Three opens, Frank has severed his ties with the Group and has returned to the FBI as a consultant. Based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, he and Jordan have left Seattle and are now living in Fall's Church, Virginia. The transition hasn't been easy for the pair - Jordan still sets a place for Catherine at the dinner table, while its obvious Catherine's father blames Frank for her death. Frank has been attending sessions at the FBI Psychiatric Evaluation Office for five months and has made, it appears, significant progress. Although Frank's boss, Andy McClaren, is reluctant to assign him to cases, Frank is keen to return to work. McClaren is also very dubious about Frank's claims about the Group - he seems to believe they indicate, at best, a certain level of stress. In fact, McClaren in happy continue working with the Group in general and Peter Watts in particular.

In addition to McClaren, Frank's new circumstances bring a couple of other new characters. The most notable is Agent Emma Hollis, played by Klea Scott, who becomes Frank's new sidekick. She's a very likeable character who's had more than her fair share of kicks in her personal life - unfortunately for Hollis, some of these kicks play key parts in some of the season's stronger episodes. Unlike some of the other support characters ""Millennium"" has had - particularly Lara Means - Hollis is definitely an asset. When we first meet Emma, she's partnering Barry Baldwin, an ambitious, smug and snotty individual who suffers from a definite superiority complex. He features only occasionally, but in the early episodes it's very enjoyable watching Frank pulling the rug form beneath his feet.

While Carter's return to ""Millennium"" didn't see a complete return to what the show had been in Season One - nor could it have following Morgan and Wong' stewardship - Season Three is a drastic improvement on Season Two. Despite Frank's vow to bring the Group down, many of the episodes don't have a `Frank against the Group' theme. Some of the episodes are conspiracy-based, while others are plain, everyday, `normal' sort of crimes. Of the 22 episodes, there were only two I didn't really enjoy. ""...Thirteen Years Later"" was pretty poor - it was little more than a pastiche of the slasher movie, and was like something Morgan and Wong would've dreamt up. ""Omerta"" didn't do a great deal for me either - there was just too much Christmas cheer ! Some of the other episodes are excellent, though - some of the very best look into Emma's past. ""Human Essence"" sees Emma take a trip to Vancouver on family-related business, a trip that also threatens her career. The episode also sees some contributions from two other very well-known FBI Agents. Other episodes, like ""Collateral Damage"", give Peter Watts a chance to come out and play. (That episode also features James Marsters, who may be better known as Spike from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - Marsters was one of several notable guest stars the season had to offer). ""Darwin's Eye"" was also excellent, though the season really saved its best for last with ""Via Dolarosa"" and ""Goodbye to All That"".

Among the extras is a ""Making of Season Three"" documentary which, like the equivalent features on the previous seasons, is well worth watching. There were a couple of comments that I found slightly off-the-mark though. The decision to make the Millennium Group `evil' was essentially taken by Morgan and Wong in Season Two - remember what happened in that season's finale ? - and Frank's decision to leave the Group was really the most obvious thing to do. There was also a comment Lance Henriksen made about Frank and Peter Watts no longer being friends and, at times, there is clear friction between the two. However, looking at the last couple of episodes especially, it seemed to me that Watts bore Frank no real malice and the friendship may well have been alive on his part. If anything, the Group were a little more successful in manipulating Watts than they had been with Frank.

Overall, Season Three was a strong finish for ""Millennium"" - the improvement over Season Two can't be exaggerated. However, I'm sorry the show had to finish at all. There is a sense that part of the story remains untold - I do have some questions about what happened between the last episode of Season Three and Frank's visit from Mulder and Scully. (There's a `bonus' episode of the X-Files, where Frank makes a guest appearance). If only someone from Fox would authorise a movie or - even better - Season Four...",1132531200,3,5853,4.962283384301733
2334512,4,B0009X76XW,"I loved the first two seasons (Season 1 a little more than 2), but I didn't remember much of Season 3. I bought this set the day it came out and I have just finished all the episodes today. It usually only takes me about two weeks to get through an entire season, but the third season of Millennium was lacking and did not hold my interest like the first two did. Lance is still great, but his new partner is boring and doesn't stand an acting chance playing opposite of the interesting Frank Black. There are only a couple of stand out episodes here and most are average at best. You should buy this set if you already have the first two, but those new to the show should stay away from Season 3. I thought it was pretty cool that this DVD set also contains the X-Files episode ""Millennium"" from the seventh season to properly close out the show, which is a nice added touch to a well packaged and great priced DVD set.

2334518,2,B0009X76XW,"I am truly confused by Chris Carter's anger at the direction Millenium took in the second season. He contended that the show was never intended to be supernatural. But it was in this first season where an angel from heaven struck down a shape-shifting demon with a lightening bolt! Season one introduced us to Legion/Lucy Butler, who was a demon, if not the devil itself...

The second season, aside from there being too many comical stand-alone episodes, was brilliant, in my opinion. Chris Carter hated it. I have to wonder why he allowed his name to be associated with the show during season two, when he not only didn't consult during this year, but reportedly never watched the episdoes until the season was over!

That takes us to third and final season. It is poorly written. Frank returns to the FBI, at least that is what we are supposed to believe. I found not one FBI character REMOTELY convincing at ALL...

*The FBI director spends the entire season acting clueless about everything, and fires Frank at least 3 times, and yet Frank comes back again next week, with nothing said about why he was allowed to return. This chracter is terribly written, and miscast...FRANK: ""I think the Millenium group did this""

DIRECTOR: "" Just drop it Frank, that an order!"" Prepare for these two lines to be repeated about 15 times over the course of the season.

*Barry Baldwin is never given one line where he doesn't come off like a moron. He is NEVER right in any of his assumptions about the nature of the killers, EVER. I apparently missed something early on...I spent the entire season thinking he was a rookie agent, until the last episode, where you find out he was a 10-year vet. in line to succeed the current director! ABSURD.

*Frank's partner is poorly written as well. I never believed she was an agent in the FBI. She is allowed free reign to do whatever she wants, disobeys direct orders from superior officers every episode,with no consequence. She is the real star of the show. Frank is reduced to a sidekick mentor most of the time. I did not care about her half-sister, or her father. I did not care about her choice at the end of the season, other than maybe it would mean reduced screen time for her if season 4 came out.

*Frank Black is great, when he is allowed to be. As I said, for some reason the season's focus isn't really on him.

The stories are almost all horrible. The 2-part premiere is terrible. The contact lens the remote-viewing women use look so cheap and fake. We get an episode about a school shooting, since this was big in the news at the time. There is one ep. where Frank discovers the group did something to CCH Pounder's character (yeah the one who tried to kill Frank in season two) Frank is horrified, and tries to find justice for her, and never mentions her betrayal in Season 2. I found this strange. One show is all about heroin that turns you into a mutant, which is the worst episode in the shows history. i could go on and on. Virtually none of the episodes seem like cases that EITHER of the first two seasons would or should have covered.

It also makes me mad that we get no quotes before the ep. anymore. The 2-3 min. teasers before the episodes were bad, too. Either nothing dramatic would happen, and then trigger the theme song, or something WOULD happen, but the song cue comes at an awkward time. It's hard to explain, but you notice it.

Back to my complaints with Chris Carter. There are many supernatural things going on with season three. The shape-shifting Millenium hitman is one. Lucy Butler can morph into hell hounds is another. If you are going to gripe about seaosn two, at least get your story straight (literally)",1128124800,14,3690,4.552036199095022
2334519,3,B0009X76XW,"I've never written a review for any product before, but I feel compelled to for this last season of Millennium.  First and foremost, this show was, by far, one of the most influential, well produced, and underrated programs to ever air on television.  It is also unique in that it illustrates just how a concept can be interpreted very differently by a few individuals.  I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did, even after a single season, Fox was very brave to stay with it and it just goes to show how progressive a network they've been for the past decade.

Now, Millennium, and those that enjoy the show, can basically be put into two categories, and people have been pouring over them here in a number of reviews.  Millennium of the first season, the darker, gritty crime scene, profiling a new killer each week; and Millennium of the second season, somewhat lighter, more `group' centered, and much larger and more involved story arcs.  That's the split.  And if you like the first season then you'll like the third.  That can't be said as much for somebody who responded more to the second season.

I am individual who prefers the second season, and sees that as more of the direction Millennium performed best in.  Millennium was a good show its first season, it just lacked something that could have pushed it over into being great.  Now usually when the creator of a series becomes less involved the show has a tendency to dwindle in creativity and vision.  But Chris Cater leaving Millennium during the second season was the best thing that happened to that production.  No disrespect to Chris Carter, who is very creative, and did a wonderful job on the X-Files, it's just that Morgan and Wong took what was a rather undefined concept and created a brilliant and engaging second season.  With its secret societies, religious iconography, and a more defined yet still murky mythology, it became the crutch of what Millennium was all about for a number of people.  But it was also Morgan and Wong who ultimately killed Millennium, and the third season could have been a lot better, even if they were planning on leaving, if the last two episodes of the second season, `The Fourth Horseman' and `The Time Is Now,' were either completely different, or had a different outcome.  Now taken on their own, they are brilliant, and would have provided a unique closure to the series, `The Time Is Now' in particular is very bizarre and wonderful, and still strikes me as odd to have ever been on television.  But if there was even a glimmer of the series having a third season, Frank's wife Catherine should have never been killed off, and the Millennium group, as shadowy and potentially dangerous as they had been portrayed, should not have assumed the role of the series' nemesis.  This shifted the focus of the show into a constant vendetta for Frank against the Millennium group in the third season, yet ultimately not providing him any base other than his daughter by which to ground himself, and most of the time this wasn't enough.

I'm not certain, maybe Morgan and Wong could have made this concept compelling, Carter and the other producers he brought in couldn't, at least not at the same level as season two.  Series rest on the relationships between the characters, regardless of what is going on in the story, and as such the third season starts off on a very low note.  Catherine is gone, Frank and Peter Watts' relationship has degenerated, Lara Means is absent, and even Detective Geibelhouse is nowhere to be found, save the episode `The Sound Of Snow.'  And I'm sorry, but Special Agent Emma Hollis is no replacement for Lara Means, and her and Frank never have anything close to the chemistry that the other two shared.  It also gets rather annoying when after just about any crime is committed Hollis sidles up to Frank and asks, wide-eyed, ""Is it the group?""  I don't know anything about Klea Scott, or her career after Millennium, but maybe she could use the royalties from these DVD sales and buy some acting lessons.  Not to be too harsh, but I never believed she was an FBI agent.

I guess the problem here is expectation.  Season three is not bad, and I'd be more inclined to watch any episode of Millennium, even the worst ones, over 95% of anything else on television.  And again, if you're more inclined to like the first season over the second, season three will satisfy you.  But I feel there was a wasted opportunity here, and that season three both in story and in character development never got close to the brilliance that was season two.",1127088000,14,4580,4.675810473815462
2334520,5,B0009X76XW,"The third season was evidently the most challenging season for the production team behind the series.  Executive producers Glen Morgan and James Wong that had helmed the second season had shifted the focus of the series from a dreary ""serial killer of the week"" format to a show focused on the spiritual and religious issues associated with the coming new millennium.  By far, the second season is a dramatic improvement over the first.  However, knowing the second season was to be their last association with the series,  in the two-part finale episodes, they basically started the apocalypse with the arrival of the Great Plague.

Resuming his grip on the creative control of the series in the third season and with a new set of executive producers, Chris Carter decided that the show had not developed in the direction that he had envisioned when he conceived it.  He made a conscious decision to sweep away the religious iconography that had become characteristic of the series in the second season.  Coupled with that task, a major character (Frank Black's wife played by Megan Gallagher) had died as a result of the unleashed plague, and he had to figure out how to continue a show when the end-of-the-world had begun.

Many people probably saw it coming, but the only way Chris Carter and his new creative team could continue Millennium for a third season was to downplay the events at the conclusion of the second season.  It turns out that it was not the Great Plague, and it apparently trickled out.  Not much exposition is given to this in the two-part opening episodes of the season (""The Innocents"" and ""Exegesis""), and as such many avid followers of the second season will feel an immediate disconnect.  The death of Frank Black's wife and the culmination of the events of the second season have led to Frank's (Lance Henriksen) decision to resign from the Millennium Group, who he is now certain have less than altruistic secret agendas.  He has returned to the Washington D.C. area to accept a position as consultant for the FBI behavioral sciences division, where he has been partnered with a young FBI agent, Emma Hollis (Klea Scott).  From this point, Frank continues to investigate high profile crimes without the Judeo-Christian influences of the Millennium Group.

Early warning: the early episodes of the third season are, in my opinion, rather bland.  This not to say that the stories are weak (though, ""Closure"" and ""Human Essence"" are really really bad episodes, probably the lowest points of the whole series), but after becoming accustomed to the scripts having an underlying spiritual meaning, these episodes came across as flat crime stories.  And anyone who had become attached to the creative trends of the second season will have difficulty transitioning to the third season.

Apparently somewhere midway through the season, the new producers saw the fanbase dwindling as a result of the changes, and as such began to slowly revert to the storytelling of the second season.  Beginning with ""Borrowed Time"", which is an emotionally gripping episode as Frank confronts the possible loss of his daughter, to ""The Sound of Snow"" which finally explains what happened at the conclusion of the previous season especially with regard to Frank Black's wife, to ""Antipas"" featuring the return of Lucy Butler, and ""Saturn Dreaming of Mercury"" where Frank Black's daughter Jordan confronts a demonic boy.

There are some continuity problems between this season and the previous ones as well.  In ""Seven and One"", which is an otherwise excellent episode, we are told about an event from Frank Black's childhood with his brothers (plural!).  This conflicts with the established storyline that Frank Black has only one little brother Thomas, who we met in the first season episode ""Sacrament"".  Also, in ""Matryoshka"", there is a flashback sequence that suggests J. Edgar Hoover may be the founder of the Millennium Group, which seriously clashes with the second season episode ""The Hand of St. Sebastian"" that flashes back to Millennium Group members in Dark Ages.  And sadly, the two-part season/series finale episodes ""Via Dolorosa"" and ""Good Bye to All That"" fail to deliver the coda that long time fans had wanted.

Interestingly, the behind-the-scenes featurette for this season is the most brief compared to the previous boxsets.  Chris Carter states clearly at the beginning that he was not pleased with the direction the second season had gone.  Moreover, fans of the second season will find themselves annoyed with some of the interviews by the obvious disdain that writer Michael Perry shows for the Morgan/Wong helmed second season.  I find it amusing that the third season producers suggest that they had actually run out of ideas for episodes by the middle point of the third season, when in magazine articles, Morgan and Wong had said that there were tons of stories and ideas that they did not have time to explore for the show.  Also on the DVD is another featurette containing discussions with real-life Academy Group members.  Lastly, the X-Files' episode ""Millennium"" featuring the return of Frank Black is also included on the final disk.

This boxset is a ""must own"" for any fan of the TV series Millennium.  And for the more casual viewer, there are quite a few remarkable episodes from this season.  As I mentioned before, fans of the second season will have some measure of difficulty accepting the changes in this season: the early departure from spiritual/end of the world themed episodes, the demonization of the Millennium Group and particularly of beloved character Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn), and the continuity conflicts.  Still, this season holds some great promise, and we can always wonder what might have been in store for us had the show been renewed for a fourth season.  Viewers will see that there was an interesting plotline developing towards the end of the season that sadly never came to full fruition.

**And one nitpicker's point: one episode of the third season will leave many viewers scratching their heads called ""Bardo Thodol"".  There are two threads in the plot that are both engaging and they do intertwine, though it is never made clear how they do: one involves red lacquer Tibetan bowls and another involves Frankstein-like stem cell research.  In only some TV markets, when this episode first aired, there were additional scenes included such as Peter Watts angrily smashing one of these red lacquer bowls.  These lost scenes were not added to the episode on this boxset.  When I bought this DVD set, I was hoping that I might finally get to see them and perhaps better understand the episode, but sadly they are not here.**",1126828800,10,6700,5.007213706041479
2334521,3,B0009X76XW,"The first season was really cool, with narly murders and grizzly visions through our protagonist; Frank Black.

Then, it got a little weird. The second season is just kind of fluff. There's a couple great stories and some creepy episodes but I couldn't really get Into It. So again with the third, and again it's just kind of a waste of time.

This Is a good show, beautifully shot and cast pretty well. Budget is not bad and there's a nice feel to everything about it. With that said, I just can't get jiggy with it.",1126656000,2,517,4.375
2334522,5,B0009X76XW,"(***This contains Season Two SPOILERS!***)

The Good:

I had no idea what to expect with Season Three, I had never seen a single episode. Having been left for 9 months with the conclusion of the Season Two DVD set, my mind wandered about what Season Three would bring; Frank isolated at the cabin, Jordan now missing her mother, a huge infectious outbreak, all to be summed up... finally! I was also anxious to get this set to see who would be ""left standing"". Sadly it appears that ""Lara Means"" got the ax though she may reappear, but fortunately everyone else is onboard. It wasn't made wholly clear whether Lara died in the S2 closer, but I can hope she didn't.

I can say that as soon as I opened the box and looked at the art work I was skeptical. Seeing the attractive African American female so proximately displayed instantly made me think of one word; pandering. But maybe I shouldn't have jumped to such a radical conclusion because Klea Scott (as Agent Hollis) has proved to be a tremendous asset! Her humble demeanor is so perfect I'm truly glad she's here. Another new face that is a welcome addition is the ""Agent Baldwin"" role. His sarcastic and ""by the book"" no-nonsense way plays off of Scott perfectly, not to mention Frank. Even Frank's new boss is solid and above par. Of course Lance and Terry (Frank Black/Peter Watts) are also well above par and this season promises to be a treat since the main focus seems to be them as adversaries which was always their strong suits.

I loved the Glen Morgan and James Wong vision of Season 2 with its lean towards a fantasy/history hybrid though Chip Johannessen's and Michael Duggan's (Season 3) seems tighter, similar, and actually somewhat more consistent (so far); even the humorous elements in certain episodes have returned (Kiss!). I'm really surprised by the overall quality... shocked actually, because so far this has lived up to Season 2, which out does my expectations there.

The (not so) Good:

There is a rough spot here and there though. The two parter that starts off Season Three has some amazing qualities, particularly in the production and casting areas, though what it lacks is continuity. In the last episode of S2 ""The Time Is Now"" the infection rates and scope seemed huge; from San Diego to even the Asian coast, however the infection as discussed in ""The Innocents"" (the S3 opener), describes the outbreak as being confined to the North West and killing 70 people. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't jibe and what was the graying hair on Frank all about? The flickering TV? I think I envisioned Season Three to be almost a post-Apocalyptic siege of sorts, what I got is a solid, well controlled, if confusing review of prior events. Another bit of a niggle I have; as much as I like the Agent Hollis role, the Frank Black role sometimes appears to be a foot-note. Hopefully as the show progresses his presence will too. Lastly, like Season 2, the episodes NOT about the Millennium Group are all over the map and range from; Great: ""Closure"", Typical: ""Through a Glass, Darkly"", and Generic: ""Teotwawki,"" it's just too bad every episode couldn't be about ""the Group"".

The Packaging/Extra's:

Kudos' to Fox for keeping the packaging consistent and not being tempted by the double-sided discs so many of the ""evil"" companies are embracing. This is probably the only 3 season set I have besides Star Trek that didn't under go some wild alterations or cost cutting measures. The extras are a bit too sparse, though welcome. On the back of the box it says that commentaries are provided for certain episodes, what it doesn't say is that there is only two of them. I have yet to watch the behind the scenes though if previous seasons are a quality barometer, these will surely be instructive and worthwhile. And making an unwelcome return is the ETERNITY it takes to get through the menu start-up screen.

The Aftermath:

In conclusion I do feel pangs of guilt over Millennium. Truly, I do. On network television I never watched beyond the first Season as it seemed the ""serial killer of the week"" scenario was severely overplayed, but now I feel total regret at not taking the time to watch the re-inventing of each Season (how was I to know?). God only knows where this show could have gone and now I guess we'll never really know. Though I've only watched a handful of this seasons efforts I would like to extend an invitation to Fox, Chris Carter, and of course Lance Henriksen to revive this show via the big screen or whatever vehicle is possible. I think I can speak for many here at Amazon and beyond when I say; build it, and we will come... now.",1126137600,25,4635,4.66217870257038
2334523,5,B0009X76XW,"I haven't gotten this one yet (haven't been paid!) but will ASAP.  I remember when FOX was playing this show in general at 2am every friday nite.  I would stay up all nite to see, what I consider and most networks do also by the number of copy cats of this show, the best show ever.  I love Lance Henriksen; I always have and will.  Seeing him in a show like this showed the true depth of his ability.  Chris Carter is of course the genius behind this and the X-files (sadly, firefly was a complete bomb).  Every single show of this caliber (CSI, profiler, all the other poor attempts to be original) is still around which is a testament in itself to what people wanted and still want.  Sadly Millennium was so far ahead of it's time it got skipped over, was called too dark and disturbing.  Obviously the general public has become more disturbed if they believe shows the likes of what is on now are acceptable, but weren't back when it was orignal!!  In the end there was great closure to what I consider the best show ever made.  Often duplicated.  Never come close.",1125964800,2,1069,4.375634517766497
2334524,5,B0009X76XW,"The third, and sadly final, season of Chris Carter's Millennium finds Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) coping with life without his wife, and without the sinister Millennium group.  During the course of the season, Frank is more or less teamed up with FBI Special Agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) to bring the group to justice, while trying to care for his young daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady).  While season three is a step down compared to the excellent and visionary first two seasons, the third season of Millennium still proved to be one of the best shows of it's genrein years, thanks to the brilliant vision of Carter and his staff, and especially to the brilliant performances of Henriksen, which are the absolute best of his career.  The series ends with most of the loose ends tied up, but the fans, and especially Carter weren't completely satisfied.  Just before the year 2000 hit in the seventh season of Carter's X-Files, Henriksen reprised his role in a special crossover episode which sees Frank teaming up with Mulder and Scully to take on the Millennium group one last time.  All in all, as loyal fans of the show already know, the third season of Millennium was a sad ending to a brilliant show, but it's quite a fitting one.",1123459200,8,1243,4.7627906976744185
