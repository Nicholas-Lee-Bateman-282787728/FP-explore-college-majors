Not only is this a learning experience, but truly a bonding one, lots of play involved.  My dogs love the interaction and eagerly run into their crates to start the games. Highly recommend.

My dog is fine with being in a crate, so I didn't understand why it kept getting recommended to me. It just didn't seem relevant.  I finally ended up getting the DVD, and I'm SO glad I watched it.  It really helps wonders with motivation.  My dog is training in agility, and he can often be unmotivated and unfocused, so I've been doing lots of reading and DVD watching to look for ways to help with our issues.  Normally, when we practice agility in our backyard, my dog gets bored and distracted after only about 5 minutes (or less).  We started incorporating crate games into agility 3 days ago, and have had amazing training sessions since. When I put crates around, he amazingly can be focused, motivated, and running fast and enthusiastically for 30 minutes straight.  What a change!  My dog used to find jumps boring, and we've been practicing jump sequences lately (which didn't help his lack of enthusiasm for them).  Before crate games, he would do a couple sequences and then be over it and just wander around sniffing and ignoring me.  When I incorporated 2 crates into jump drills, all of a sudden he loves jump drills!  Getting to run crate to crate is somehow so much fun for a dog, and he absolutely loves it.  I highly recommend crate games for any dog that needs motivation for any type of training (not just agility.)",1327708800,28,1568,4.498233215547703

3110332,2,B0013GJJG6,"Did anyone else notice the example dog for the first two segments (when the dog is supposedly new to crating) was very comfortable sitting in that crate? If you're making a video to demonstrate training techniques, most people would start with a beginner and perhaps give more than one example. There is only one example clip for each of the first two stages of training. Many times throughout the video, behavior is described without any visual, such as Susan describing training multiple dogs while simply standing by a pen with three dogs or saying ""if the dog's paws come off the bed you should..."" while standing by a dog whose paws are off of the bed. Perhaps it's because this video was thrown together quickly; Susan misspeaks at several points but glosses over it like she's delivering the news on live tv. Why not retape the little segment?
I did appreciate the segments at the end with more information for various situations, but it was mostly the trainer sitting on a crate talking about scenarios. It was a bit like a book on (video)tape.",1484870400,11,1052,4.7228260869565215

I was hoping for games to play with dogs who have more fear/anxiety about being in the crate, however this video starts out with dogs who are already fine with going in the crate.

I gave it 4 stars because the music in between segments just about made me climb out of my skin, so watching the dvd for me was not enjoyable as I'd hoped it would be.

3110341,5,B0013GJJG6,"Great for teaching for dog self-control. I have an australian cattle dog that benefitted greatly from this DVD. She had a blast in the beginning!

I will say, however, that the games can be repetitive and eventually my dog tired of them .... but this is a great starting point for dog training. Plus my dog now loves her crate. Furthermore, it helps teach basics you may need if you decide to compete with your dog later in life. Sending your dog away (in this case to their crate) is a very helpful basic framework for sending them over agility equipment and to fetch things.",1473206400,2,576,4.485714285714286

I was wrong when i thought we didn't need a crate.  Our dog loves it!  At home we keep the door open and our dog sleeps in it,,, stores his toys in it instead of burring them in the yard,,, and he hides from thunderstorms in it.  IT's HIS DEN.

I will say that there are no magic bullets contained in here.  It's a very methodical program to work on perfect recalls and a lot of enthusiastic drive in your dog, but it will require an investment of time.  Since recalls are the most difficult thing to get really good in dog training, these techniques are really creative and helpful.

3344829,2,B0013GJJG6,"Did anyone else notice the example dog for the first two segments (when the dog is supposedly new to crating) was very comfortable sitting in that crate? If you're making a video to demonstrate training techniques, most people would start with a beginner and perhaps give more than one example. There is only one example clip for each of the first two stages of training. Many times throughout the video, behavior is described without any visual, such as Susan describing training multiple dogs while simply standing by a pen with three dogs or saying ""if the dog's paws come off the bed you should..."" while standing by a dog whose paws are off of the bed. Perhaps it's because this video was thrown together quickly; Susan misspeaks at several points but glosses over it like she's delivering the news on live tv. Why not retape the little segment?
I did appreciate the segments at the end with more information for various situations, but it was mostly the trainer sitting on a crate talking about scenarios. It was a bit like a book on (video)tape.",1484870400,11,1052,4.7228260869565215

I was hoping for games to play with dogs who have more fear/anxiety about being in the crate, however this video starts out with dogs who are already fine with going in the crate.

I gave it 4 stars because the music in between segments just about made me climb out of my skin, so watching the dvd for me was not enjoyable as I'd hoped it would be.

I will say, however, that the games can be repetitive and eventually my dog tired of them .... but this is a great starting point for dog training. Plus my dog now loves her crate. Furthermore, it helps teach basics you may need if you decide to compete with your dog later in life. Sending your dog away (in this case to their crate) is a very helpful basic framework for sending them over agility equipment and to fetch things.",1473206400,2,576,4.485714285714286

We got this DVD b'cuz i have never really believed a crate was necessary, but when we took an obedience class that required crating our dog i needed to get one.  I was wrong when i thought we didn't need a crate.  Our dog loves it!  At home we keep the door open and our dog sleeps in it,,, stores his toys in it instead of burring them in the yard,,, and he hides from thunderstorms in it.  IT's HIS DEN.

I will say that there are no magic bullets contained in here.  It's a very methodical program to work on perfect recalls and a lot of enthusiastic drive in your dog, but it will require an investment of time.  Since recalls are the most difficult thing to get really good in dog training, these techniques are really creative and helpful.
