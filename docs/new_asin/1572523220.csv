7797506,4,1572523220,"When accused of being a mob lawyer, Oscar was famous for saying ""what mob?""  This was often interpreted as implying that there was no ""mob.""  It could also just as easily have been interpreted to mean ""which mob?""  Now, years later, his participation in Mob Law seems to answer both questions.  It was a good video, and a must see for local Las Vegans.  The music in the film was excellent.  It brought an eery loneliness to the film, as well as a kind of an impending doom to the whole production.  That is not to say that Mob Law was not also comical in places.  I recommend it.",1172016000,2,580,4.256880733944954
7797507,5,1572523220,"Perhaps there is an inherent conflict of interest in this review. I appear in this documentary and know the principal subject, Oscar Goodman, quite  well. Yet, because of my intimacy with the film, an equal argument could be  made that I am in a unique position of being able to judge just how  accurately Wilmhurst captured Mayor Goodman and the City of the Living  Elvis. ""Mob Law"" is a study of former Mob attorney and now Las  Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman (filmed considerably prior to Goodman's  election). The work examines his belief in vigorous criminal defense as an  important constitutional safeguard, and sheds light on the world view of a  few of his more colorful clients. Shot in traditional BBC style - the  work's principal technical merit is the use made of light - the surprise  comes in editing. I rather suspect Wilmhurst has studied Wong Kar-Wai in  that regard. Has the work captured Las Vegas? Certainly, and with an  insider's depth of understanding. Has it captured Goodman? Considering that  Oscar is a character so complex that he played himself in Scorsese's  ""Casino,"" it cannot have been an easy task, but I believe  Wilmhurst did a superb job. Does the work push the documentary envelope? I  leave that for you to judge. If you are interested in a view of Las Vegas  obtainable in no other fashion, then Mob Law succeeds admirably.",967766400,6,1360,4.793103448275862
