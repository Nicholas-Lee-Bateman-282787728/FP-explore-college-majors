There were clips of films taken, when available, and interviews, plus old pictures, and information about the builders, sometimes about the politics behind the building of a monument.  I enjoyed it, even on the monuments in which I'd never had too much interest.",1447113600,2,455,5.135135135135135

8524256,4,B0082GN8SK,"History invites its audience to go behind the scenes of some well-known monuments of the Continental United States to discover how they came into existence.  Superb photography, nice drawings, meaningful archive newsreel footage, moving witness accounts, expert comments, and judicious computer animation bring to light some less well-known aspects of these landmarks.  In summary, the DVD set under review is a nice pedagogical tool that will fall into the good graces of a broad audience.",1348272000,4,490,5.52
