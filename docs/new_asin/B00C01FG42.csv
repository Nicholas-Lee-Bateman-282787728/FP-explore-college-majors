5683335,5,B00C01FG42,"I ordered this not because I'm training to ride a century, but because I moved to an area that has a limited selection of spinning classes. I don't want to fight for a bike or get up at 5 a.m., so I got my own spinning bike and went searching for a decent DVD. I chose this set for a few reasons: 1) Real-time road footage of a 100-mile (century) bike tour through Colorado helps you visualize and focus. The superimposed graphic dashboard recommends appropriate cadence and resistance level. An aerial map tracks speed and elevation. A graphic of the hill profile gives you an idea of the type of climb you're facing. 2) The set comes with 4 DVDs, so you get variety with your workouts. Stage 1 is a 1-hour ride with rolling hills; Stage 2 is 1.5-hour ride with some more strenuous climbs; Stage 3 is a 2-hour ride with some intense interval-type climbs; Stage 4 is a 1-hour ride with yet more intervals. 3) The audio comes with three options: narration over music, just music, and only the road noise. The driving beat of the dance-style music keeps me focused. I don't recognize the songs, but I'm just glad that I don't have to listen to cheesy canned music! The director/narrator Paul Gallas uses BiTBoP technology (behind the bars of Paul) and rides along with you and a ""cycle buddy"" who always ditches us halfway through the ride (nice buddy!). You can tell by his huffing and puffing that Paul is also doing the ride, but I suspect that Paul was narrating from an armchair during Stage 4. He sounded a bit too comfortable and relaxed. If Cycling Videos Online produces more of these DVDs, I'd like a scene selection option so that I can break up the videos into smaller 1-hour chunks without too much guesswork.",1285545600,74,1720,4.533762057877814
5683336,5,B00C01FG42,"I have purchased hundereds of items on Amazon but this is my first review, I'm that passionate about these DVDs.  I have tried nearly every spinning/indoor workout DVD out there and these DVDs are by far the best.  I get tired of having a guy with a stopwatch yell at me - - these DVDs are so much better; I actually get into the rides.  The commentary is helpful and the fact that the narrator is actually doing the workout as well makes a huge difference.  After trying Erock Rocks! I bought every one of Paul's DVDs - - I'm ready for Fall and Winter training!",1280707200,17,562,4.273584905660377
5683337,5,B00C01FG42,"My husband and I have about seven other of Paul's DVD's for indoor cycling on a trainer.  We enjoy all of them and they have greatly improved my cycling ability over this winter.  All are a challenge if you use the DVD's correctly.  Last week we received the ERock Rocks DVD's.  While we have only had the chance to use the first stage DVD we can tell you unequivocally that WE ARE CRAZY ABOUT THESE DVD'S!!! Sorry for shouting but these DVD's are awesome.  Paul does commentary throughout the whole ride and gives invaluable tips on training for a Century ride, or improving if you've already done a Century.  We learned so much on just the first DVD.  We love ""riding with Paul"" and having him coach us to being better riders.  This is unlike any other cycling DVD for your indoor trainer.  This is like having your very own coach.  We cannot recommend the ERock Rocks DVD's highly enough.

Once again, Paul sets the bar and standard for other cycling DVD's.  Great job!!!!",1270339200,36,975,4.540229885057471

5683340,5,B00C01FG42,"This is filmed during one of Colorado's premier century rides, Elephant Rocks, which has thousands of participants and is on it's 27th anniversary this year.  I find the reviews complaining about looking at someone's backside funny because that's what you really do on group rides.  (Note:  if you don't want a group ride feel, then try CA Backroads or Arches). For me, it motivates me because it feels like a real ride and like I'm fighting to keep my spot on his wheel.  I also think it's funny when people complain about the scenery, you can complain to the event sponsors, but after 26 years I think they like their route.  These videos are workout videos not scenic videos.  The dashboard is interactive like a video game and keeps you busy so time flies by.  If you use the dashboard and a heart rate monitor, I guarantee you will dripping sweat (and after the hard disks I'm laying on the floor).  It's even harder with a cadence sensor.  A few years ago, I tried riding on a trainer without videos and 20 minutes felt like forever.  I also like this set it because it gives a variety of workouts, disks 1 and 2 can be used for easier days and disk 3 and 4 can be used for harder days or you can put them together for longer rides.  Also these videos are scalable, if you're a beginner, you can use them without a heart rate monitor and you can ride in one or two gears easier.  You can make it harder using a heart rate monitor and/or cadence sensor.  If you're a beast you use a power meter and can ride in one or two gears harder :)",1392595200,,1542,4.294117647058823
5683341,2,B00C01FG42,I did not find this enjoyable.  Motivated me a tiny bit because I was following someone. But the persons breathing and the monitor on bottom of screen was a mess. I just want a ride.  Bike o vision is way to go.  Forget these,1392422400,,225,4.068181818181818
5683342,3,B00C01FG42,"the view never changes!  Seriously, I don't mind being a pack animal, but I didn't like the focus to generally be on this guy's butt and just the road the entire time.
The ride was boring and flat and nothing to look at.  If I wanted that, I could have continued to look at my beige walls.  It's okay if ya just want to plug it in and ride in a mindless sort of daze, but gotta say, the other dvd's I had were better.  And all that info on the bottom of the screen?  Useless for me.",1392336000,,482,3.877551020408163

5683344,4,B00C01FG42,Trying to keep up with gear changes and matching cadence keeps you on your toes so did not go mind numb sitting on the trainer.  As a result time went by quickly.  Looking forward to spend a long period in one spell.,1390348800,,216,4.119047619047619
5683345,2,B00C01FG42,"The cd is annoying with the rider always talking during the ride, huffing and puffing and also not able to read the graphs on the screen to follow the suggested gearing, heart rate, cadence, etc. because it is so small and in the corner of the screen.  It is really annoying to hear the gear shifting when the rider does this.  The scenery was beautiful, but the rider caused the lower rating.  Even my husband didn't like the talking.",1388016000,,435,4.481012658227848
5683346,5,B00C01FG42,"Today I used ERock video 1, a one-hour ride in which I matched their resistance for interval training. While I love cycling videos with a view and this was mainly long highways, it didn't matter. I was so busy changing the resistance for hills and flats that I probably wouldn't have noticed if the scenery had changed. The commentary may annoy some people so they just want to have the sounds of the ride or maybe music or possibly both, it keeps me distracted when I get tired. It's also a reminder about food and water choices before and during a long ride. I'm going to take a break for lunch and then see if I can do another hour today. The next one in the ERock Rocks series is going to be tougher and have more scenery, both at the same time. I'm looking forward to that. I recommend these videos. You can do them on your own equipment, no matter what that equipment is or what kind of physical shape you are in. I'm probably in the middle somewhere, which is fine. Knowing that I have one of these waiting for me is a real incentive to go upstairs to my workout room and get started.

I came back and did the 2nd ride, 1-1/2 hours. I was ready to stop at the end, but I can't wait to to the next one tomorrow.

Update: I did the 3rd disc, which was 2 hours of way too many hills. I thought about giving up a second or two, but refused to do that since the people on the DVD weren't quitting.  That was last night. Today I hope to do the 4th disc, which is supposed to be the best scenery, not that I have time to notice.",1384041600,,1528,4.086666666666667
5683347,5,B00C01FG42,Paul's vids are great.  He is a cyclist and understands that trainer/roller time can be painful and does a great job making it much less so.  Highly recommended.,1383264000,,161,4.714285714285714
5683348,5,B00C01FG42,"Love it so far. Narrator is informative,  witty,  and motivating. I am on disk 4, I look forward to completeing my first century this Winter.",1382745600,,141,4.6
5683349,2,B00C01FG42,"The DVD touts "" the most scenic and diverse landscaping"". Thoroughly disappointed with the ""scenery"". I browsed all 4 DVDs and the main scenery is someone's rear.",1378512000,,162,5.037037037037037
5683350,5,B00C01FG42,"I was so hesitant about this series. I almost returned it when I got it, because I'm used to using Josh Taylor cycling videos only. And I didn't like the Ireland ride with Josh where it's a behind the handlebar experience. THIS is nothing like the Ireland ride (sorry Josh, I still think you're the best). In THIS video you're riding with a group, you feel like you're really there, and this guy coaches you with totally worthy and relevant advice. It's REALLY good and I'm not normally a ""gusher"" but this is worth the money folks!",1377388800,,532,4.494845360824742
5683351,5,B00C01FG42,This is my first time using a cycling trainer and video. The video makes it very easy and enjoyable to get that desired burn. The workout is over before I get bored and the dashboard makes it simple to keep on target. Great buy!,1374969600,,228,4.204545454545454
5683352,5,B00C01FG42,"I bought this to use with my bike when it is too nasty out to ride.  I have used it a couple of times and you really work up a sweat with this ride.  I haven't made it through the first course yet as I am out of shape and need to work myself up.  Just the warm up is a workout.  In addition, I had some questions about the gear designations on the screen and wrote to the company.  I actually got a reply and it was very helpful.  Most companies you write to these days you are lucky to get an automatic response saying someone would get back to you.  Paul was very helpful with clearing up my confusion.

I will be buying more of these DVDs in the future.  I see many, many bike rides in my rec room during the winter months.",1366675200,,726,3.9178082191780823

5683355,5,B00C01FG42,"I used to go to the gym and take spinning classes. My favorite instructors would take us on a mental visual ride through some familiar roads in town we would adjust the tension on our bikes to climbs, flat roads or speed. It made the workout a lot of fun. That is exactly what this does. There are onscreen indicators of what your heart rate should be and what level your bike should be on. You actually see the road and the scenery is beautiful. You are placed around other bikers on a real century ride so you feel like you are there. It's just plain awesome!",1362268800,,561,4.252336448598131
5683356,5,B00C01FG42,Have only done first 2 discs but am loving the workouts.  Some great hill climbing that gets your heart rate up.  Nice scenary,1358553600,,126,4.434782608695652
5683357,2,B00C01FG42,These DVDs were boring! I tried two of the dvds and never did them again. I recommend intsructional videos similar to a spin class. (Or just wartch tv while spinning),1357776000,,166,4.566666666666666
5683358,5,B00C01FG42,"A few years ago I decided I was done with working SO hard during cycling season and then losing most of my fitness during the winter. I bought an indoor trainer. Some videos have footage of people on trainers sweating in a room while a coach yells at them. Uhhh...not so fun. Some have great metrics and directions, but you get to stare at a graph. Not so fun, either. CVO has the training metrics AND gorgeous scenery AND an informative commentary. ERocks is my favorite ride because riding an indoor century is such a gnarly thing to do. Beautiful ride, well laid out. The time goes by so much faster! The thing that's hardest for me when riding indoors is keeping focus. I can watch bike racing re-runs, but still tend to zone out after a while. Online Cycling Videos is a very helpful alternative.

HERE'S WHAT I LIKE - cadence and gearing info are displayed along with heart rate target. Continual shifting through gears helps to simulate changes in terrain. I really dig it when he gets up on the pedals to climb: which translates to a low cadence grind in your dead high gear. A series of hills essentially becomes an interval workout with the benefit of attractive scenery and informational commentary. All in all, it rocks.",1357689600,2,1232,4.6
5683359,4,B00C01FG42,"Good quality videos, passes the time for indoor rides.  Has ok read out for gearing and perceived intensity based on an on screen heart rate percentage and percentage of Incline. I'm happy with them.",1356825600,,199,4.852941176470588
5683360,5,B00C01FG42,"This is from my wife:  I've only done the first leg of the journey so far, but it was great!  I projected the image onto a large screen.  I played my own music.  My only complaint is the top gear ratio number is really small so not really usable for me.  I just used my gears to alter my rpm's to match the rpm's on the screen.  I wore my heart rate monitor and most of the time it seemed to be in the same range as what was recommended.  I did find that by using my gears to help control my rpm's that I rode at a higher gear for a longer period of time than I have ever done before.  Cardio wise I felt good at the end, but my legs were tired.  So, success!",1354924800,,659,3.7518248175182483
5683361,5,B00C01FG42,"I've had plenty of cycling DVD's, but this series is definitely the best I've ever used.  POV is over the handlebars and not from a car driving the route.  You pass other riders, crank up hills, listen to the narrator pant just like you.  Heart rate display is great as is cadence and perceived level of exertion.

I'd recommend this as a purchase or as a gift.  Can you tell that I like these DVD's?",1354060800,,400,4.28
5683362,4,B00C01FG42,"I have bought multiple Paul Gallas videos. This was my first buy and I must say that I do like them. They are definitely challenging, which is one of the key qualities that I like in a cycling video. I like that this comes as a set and if you are crazy or mad, you could technically do all of them one day if you wanted to see if you could survive a century ride. I have survived doing only one of these videos at a time, which was quite challenging since some of them are two hours.
If I were to improve these videos, I would want to see more brillant colors. The second thing I value highly in a video is the scenary. Although the scenary is pretty, Paul's Utah videos top these ones. I do like them as an addition to my collection because it mixes it up and by the time I am done, I know that I have knocked it out of the park (TKO).",1351123200,,836,3.9235294117647057
5683363,5,B00C01FG42,"I have several of Paul's cycling videos and this set is at the top of my list of favorites. The views are fantastic and it is easy to get into a good rhythm with the long ribbon of road. This is a fast paced workout though, so while anyone can enjoy the scenery, you have to be in shape to match the effort. I really like the last video of the set as the terrain offers the best of the views. I ride on an e-motion roller (amazing invention) which gives me a very realistic ride feeling that combined with the Paul's videos, can almost make you forget your on a trainer. I use Paul's data somewhat differently than I might on a stationary trainer. I really use the cadence data, but on the downhills I just try to keep a fast spin going rather than coasting since you can't coast for long on rollers. I also seem to stand more often (yes you can stand on e-motion rollers!) or out of synch with Paul's out of the saddle recommendations, but I am still riding a similar ride. The gear numbers are useful, but I have attached my own gear associations to them to keep the same ride feel. In all I probably do a bit harder ride than the video (since I never stop pedaling), but the video to ride match is excellent.",1350691200,,1211,4.17948717948718
5683364,5,B00C01FG42,This is the first of Paul Gallas videos that I have bought. I am a cyclist who has a spinning bike for the winter. I developed my own routine and it got the job done.  I bought E Rocks to break up the monotony. Wow does it work. You ride with 100 s of other riders and feel like you are on the road. The time flies and the heart rate is challenged like never before.

5683365,1,B00C01FG42,"I recommend to anyone considering purchasing this item to check first the online previews of the video on Ytube.  If you find nothing wrong with it, then go ahead and purchase. Otherwise, it will be very apparent that this is not what you, nor I, expected in the least.

5683366,5,B00C01FG42,"I bought this DVD pack for days when the weather might not be the safest to ride outdoors and I'm so glad I did.  My training schedule requires a varied number of riding hours so this suits me perfectly.  If I need a 1 hour ride I can do either the 1st or 4th DVD, 1.5 hours the 2nd, or 2 hours the 3rd. Each DVD encourages you to keep riding so it easy to pop in the next and keep going even longer. They make me want to keep riding. After all, the narrator and the other riders aren't stopping.  I really enjoy all the riding tips he talks about along the way. His tone is entertaining and informative, like a good friend/personal coach, never condescending. I even like the music.
This set helped me to prepare for my first century with way more confidence than a bunch of separate cycle videos would have.  I'm looking for more videos by this guy to keep me in the saddle over the coming winter.",1348185600,,899,4.179190751445087

When I'm at work I'm thinking about making time to use them. It inspires you to be better, do better and get fit.  If you are struggling with knee issues then this is for you.

5683368,4,B00C01FG42,this is a great video if you own a heart rate monitor. it is pretty cool how the guy doing the video is ACTUALLY biking and taping at the same time. I use my clip in pedals so I can get out of the saddle easily. Great calorie burn and pretty fun! This also teaches you how to ride a century (100 miles) so there are 5 discs to mix up the workout. It's not your typical video where a bunch of people are spinning and they are shouting out directions it is more self guided.,1345680000,,472,3.9270833333333335

5683370,4,B00C01FG42,"I got this item for a gift.  It does offer a good work-out and the narration is outstanding.  The narrator tells you when you should up your resistance and how it should feel in your pedals.  My only complaint is the suggested percentage heart rate number is to small to read from a distance beyond about 7 or 8ft and is in black, while the rpm is in bold red and can be read from 30 feet away.  But in all fairness the the narrator does mention what your heart rate percentage should be through-out the video. So, the reason I am only giving this a 4 star is that the some of the graphics are hard to read from a distance.",1331251200,4,623,4.081967213114754
5683371,5,B00C01FG42,"As an avid cyclist who would typically takes the winters off, I thought a treadmill would get me through the winter. Unfortunately, the impact bothered my knees and I decided on a spinning bike. I wanted some sort of program to spin to, but watching a room full of people spinning away made no sense to me. That's when I found BtBoP!

The ERock disk set is awesome! You can do one disk/stage as a workout or combine them. Pause at the rest stop and finish the rest of the stage the next day. Whatever works for you. I've done each disk at least a few times - combining a couple for a longer workout when time permits - and really enjoy the entire set. Paul has a lot of good tips and motivates you through the ride, but you have the option to just listen to the sound track or the ambient sounds. Or, just put your headphones on and hammer to your own sound track.

I'm looking forward to getting out on the road to see the effect that this program has had on my ""normal"" riding performance. And on those days when it's ugly outside, it's great to know that I can head to the basement and get a great workout riding with Paul through Colorado.

Note: To get the most out of these programs, a heart rate monitor is very important.",1330992000,4,1229,4.221276595744681

5683373,5,B00C01FG42,"I LOVE this video collection.  I'm a runner but due to an injury have been relegated to biking.  It gets dark in the winter, so I hung a large pull-down screen in my garage in front of my trainer and use a projector to show this video in front of me.  It's a large image and makes me feel like I'm really riding the race.  This video is well-made, well scripted, the scenery is super and the frequency of other bikers makes it interesting, as does the videographer's companion cyclist, who I tell my kids is ""my buddy"" whenever he pops in the picture.  Super job with this and please make more - makes the time go by quickly.",1329350400,,625,4.218487394957983
5683374,3,B00C01FG42,"I bought these to help provide some distraction while riding on the trainer for the winter.  Video is decent, and subject matter is good for the indoor riding -- good scenery, other riders, etc.  I had no intent, nor do I use the heart rate, rpm, shifting suggestions, etc on these videos.  I also listened to the cyclist's commentary once.  Once was enough.  Needs to chat less and ride more.

Provides a good distraction for an hour or so when you match it with your own tunes to keep you moving.

I will say that I'm glad I'm only riding with this guy via the DVD.  He must be a BEAST on the cycle - he passes each and every rider he comes upon.  However, he also has horrible riding manners.  Half-wheeling, passing on the right, weaving all over the road when climbing hills, etc.  I'd not want to be anywhere near this guy on the road - not that I could likely keep up with him anyhow.",1329091200,4,891,4.244047619047619

I am a 66 year old criminal defense attorney and Law Professor in the Chicago Metropolitan area. Though we don't have any mountains (and only a few hills) we do have some impressive-for-the-area Rails to Trails pathways, but lousy weather winters.

I assure you my orders for the rest of your Colorado and the High Country videos are only a paycheck away.

I hold you completely responsible for my significant diversion from work and family, spending extra money for the videos, not to mention phenomenally better emotional and physical health and outlook and enjoyment of life in an otherwise flat topographically boring environment. I really appreciate your attention to detail, especially enjoy the narrated videos, and look forward to a long relationship. Have a great year.",1327276800,5,1643,4.967272727272727
5683377,4,B00C01FG42,good workout with some great tips to help you reach that hundred mile gold. The video is broken into 4 segments that make it easier to fit into the day,1322956800,,151,4.066666666666666
5683378,5,B00C01FG42,"I am very much enjoying these videos. It's like you are right in the group riding in real time.
I would highly recommend them.",1321056000,,126,4.291666666666667
5683379,5,B00C01FG42,"Finally a video that not only produces results, but more important to me it makes the time spinning in the basement flyby.  No more looking at the clock which never seemed to move when watching t.v. or listening to music.  There is plenty of interaction in this video to keep you focused on the ride and nothing else. I have enjoyed Paul's video's so much at told my local bike shop about these and have recommended these to many of my friends.",1318896000,2,444,4.402439024390244
5683380,4,B00C01FG42,"E-Rock Rocks Stage 3

I've only trained on these videos at an hour at a time, but really enjoy the visuals and effort data put on the screen. I especially like the narration, because it's a great motivator. the music seems a little plastic, but does go well with the efforts put on the screen. After each ride, I compare my heart rate data to the chart to evaluate how well I did. It's a great workout, but can't imagine doing the full 2 hour piece.",1318896000,,449,4.22093023255814
5683381,5,B00C01FG42,"I am a 65 year old male, and I have owned just about every kind of exercise equipment from jump ropes (two) to rowing machines (three). I've also had memberships to gyms. Along the way I've had three different exercise bikes. The best equipment so far is my spinner bike, but only because I discovered BitBop's videos. As anyone who has used exercise equipment knows, it is hard to get your heart rate up without some kind of outside direction - usually music. Paul's videos are far better than music alone. They're the best I have found. I don't think I have ever had my heart rate up over 90% of max for extended periods of exercise. For me, 90% is only 140 bpm, but I'm old. E Rocks is four videos with around 6 hours of ride, so there is plenty to keep it fresh. Nonetheless, after listening the sound tracks for umpteen hours, I found that I could put on my headset and listen to some groovy `60s music, so I could rock out to E Rock Rocks. Just listen to your tunes and match (or try to match) the cadences and tension as shown on the video screen, and you will be sweatin' buckets.",1317859200,12,1088,4.260869565217392
5683382,5,B00C01FG42,"Stationary bike riding can be the most boring thing ever if you don't have something to focus on. This was the first virtual bike ride DVD set I ever bought, and one of my very favorites. It is five and a half hours of riding. It encompasses everything, major hills, flats, rollers. Its the complete package and the picture is so crisp and clear. I was hooked when I bought this and now I'm addicted to these videos. The instructional narrative keeps you motivated and focused too.  If you buy this one, you'll have to have them all!",1317859200,2,533,4.438775510204081
5683383,4,B00C01FG42,"Having come from indoor spin classes, I guess I expected lots of scenery and spin music, so I was surprised when it's mostly one road after another ~ about 4 and 1/2 hours of road.  Oh, well, I will use these DVD in between using just music as I spin at home.",1302652800,4,259,3.980769230769231
5683384,5,B00C01FG42,"I ordered the entire series and have done stage 1 and 2 so far.  The series is easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I am very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend to others, especially if they are training for their first century ride.  Stage 2 was 1 hour and 30 minutes and I barely noticed I was on my trainer that long. I am looking forward to what the rest of the series has in store.",1301875200,3,416,4.060975609756097

Sometimes I just like to listen to my ipod and with these dvds, all the info you need to know is on the screen. you really don't need to hear what the guy is saying.  There are enough hills and sprints to get a great workout. Before you know it you've been spinning for an hour (or more).",1298246400,6,314,3.984126984126984
5683386,5,B00C01FG42,I was given these DVD's as a gift from my husband and was thrilled to receive them.  I have completed each disc (not all on the same day) and have each time received a great work out.  I love the coaching along the road it has given me lots of good advice on how to prepare for a century ride.  I have been doing spin classes for over 2 years now and recently purchased a road bike to enter into an up and coming century ride.  I thought I had worked hard in the spin classes but these DVD's make me sweat like never before.  I can feel myself gaining more strength and I look forward to winter passing and summer arriving to get out on the road again.  I would recommend anyone who wants to work out at home to use these DVD's.  I have been through them a few times now and have not tired of them one bit.  Thanks Paul!,1294617600,9,820,3.9877300613496933
5683387,5,B00C01FG42,i got these for my wife and she loves the scenery as well as the feeling of competition of other riders as they pass you on the videos. great buy watching for more of these videos,1293580800,,179,4.0
8576007,1,B00C01FG42,"I ordered this because of the excellent reviews it has. I received the DVDs and as soon as I played DVD number one it froze on and off until it finally froze and did not respond. I tested then DVDs 2,3,4 and they worked fine. I requested Amazon a replacement and they sent it. I just received it today and as soon as I played DVD one it did the same froze and did not respond. I tested the other 3 and DVD number 3 did the same. So now I am worse that when I ordered them. I am requesting a third replacement and see if by any luck in this third one all DVDs work. For now, do no waste your money in this product. I will update this later.",1459987200,,639,3.8484848484848486

8576013,4,B00C01FG42,"This one's a great, looong video. I must admit, I have never done it in one single session, instead spreading it out on several consecutive days (though one of these days I might step up to the challenge!). Unlike most of the other videos, where it's only ""you"" on the road, this one is a century ride during a cycling festival, and that means group riding. In my case, that makes it mentally easier. Not my favorite one of CVO's Indoor Cycling Workout Video for scenery, but definitely a great one for base miles and for the challenge.",1417132800,,536,4.479591836734694

8576015,3,B00C01FG42,"I don't know how someone can talk nonstop while riding a bike. Huffing and puffing. Yes, I know bananas are a good source of potassium. So, I turned the talking off and all that's left is the constant and quite annoying clicking of this guy gears changing. It even drowns out the background music. ""click-click""; ""click-click""; ""click-click"" Every 2 seconds. I've never heard so much gear changing in my life. The scenery isn't bad if you don't mind looking at some guy's butt every so often. Is that the butt cam I wonder?",1415059200,,523,4.634408602150538
