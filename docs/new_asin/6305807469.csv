1078726,2,6305807469,"Ben Bolt is a capable director, and the here he does a good job - with everything but his lead actor. The music is wonderful, just enough to make your spine tingle. The problem here is Jodhi May. She turns in a endlessly one-note performance. She seems to be focussing so hard on not ever blinking, while her mouth is perpetually agape. Mr Bolt must be to blame for this, because she certainly seems a decent actor. Nonetheless, her performance drags this interesting production down into the realm of a cartoon. Unfortunate, for the children and housekeeper - and ghosts - are solid supporting cast. The script also is awkward and at times clumsy. I suspect the other reviewer is correct in ideally wanting to hear this story read by firelight - either 100 years ago, or perhaps tonight.",1140393600,14,788,4.676258992805756
1078727,4,6305807469,"Inevitably, I suppose, any stage or screen adaptation of James's novella must finally make a firm decision regarding what James himself is able to leave satisfyingly ambiguous on the printed page:  namely, the emotional and mental stability of the governess, played here with great zest and skill by Jodhi May.  Director Bolt's choice is clear enough; for him, the governess is (or becomes) an obsessed,  sex-starved Freudian case study--a well-intended young woman who nonetheless ends up posing an infinitely greater peril to her charges--Miles and Flora--than do any of those ghosts she (mistakenly) thinks she sees.

I myself miss the ambiguity of James's text here, but the production itself is first-rate:  terrific acting, cinematography, and casting.  However, if, as a reader of James, you are convinced that the governess is an eminently reliable narrator concerning the disturbing events at Bly, this directorial interpretation is likely to rankle.",1127174400,10,959,5.489795918367347
1078728,4,6305807469,"This is the best adaptation of this James' work with the possible exception of ""The Innocents"" with Deborah Kerr, whose emphasis is strictly on the ghost story. This film however, is a must for those who love great story telling and want to be titillated by the twists and turns of not only the main plot but the very subtly intricate sub-plot that is raging underneath

For a long time this 19th century fireside ghost tale has entertained audiences for its thrilling and supernatural side. Those fans of the psychological bent that are more interested in its dally with a supposed ""sexual hysteria"" undercurrent, will be entertained as well. Some type of emotional regression takes place and that drives the main character, Miss, (Jodhi May) from careful dominance and maintenance of a fine household and her two beautiful charges, nicely turned by Joe Sowerbutts (Miles) and Little Grace Robinson (Flora) to a final and terribly complete conclusion.

Miss replaces a former governess who has died under questionable circumstances. That her employer, The Master, (Colin Firth) has frankly 'seduced' her into hurridly engaging as governess is only the tip of an iceberg of innuendo, symbolism and complicity. Having read the short story and seen this film, I am not totally convinced of the sexual hysteria theory although actress May, an Oxford English Literature graduate, has alluded to that very concept when questioned about this role. And that mystery and those questions are what make this tale so darned intriguing.

As Miss, May is complete. The very proper parson's daughter, well educated, mannered in all ways, pretty, and quite mindful of the impossible demands of her position: ""Never trouble him, but never, never, neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself, receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and let him alone""; as written by Henry James, places her in a position of power with no room for self-doubt or escape from failure.

As the story approaches its end Miss asks her God: ""Victory requires only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue"". And turn the screw she does with tragic and unforgivable results. May captures both the subtleties of confidence and passion while allowing this wonderful governess to slowly and completely unravel. The only thing better than watching this performance would have been to hear this story told on a dark, cold night by the fireplace 100 years ago.",1124409600,32,2489,5.078239608801956
1078729,4,6305807469,"In this new Masterpiece Theatre spin on James'classic bone-chiller Ben Bolt depicts an elegent but updated  reinterpretation of the book . Unlike versions before it, we have a choice of interpretaion of events.

Other versions have underlined  the analogy of the single metallic turn of the screw within resisting but eventually accepting softer material(analogous of the outward relationship between a young governess and her charges).

 You eventually realise that Bolt might be presenting another dimension for us to unravel this evidently infamous mystery. The story is presented thus: just whom has taken charge of the care of two upper-middle class orphans; their very material new governess the attractively humane and proper  ""Miss"" or possibly more ethereal antagonists from the recent past? Do we really have a choice in this matter? And if we do should we vote for the obvious?

In Mr Bolt's production the answer to the mystery may be more shocking even than the evil desires of malevolent phantoms. We may enevitably ask ourselves,what side of Miss's bodice, within or without, so to speak, is propelling the awful inevitability of what happens?

  Does Miss really see phantoms of the recently fallen and self destroyed evil, local protagonists or are they merely a product of her own semi-repressed sexual infatuation with her employer or someone in her past? Here you may note the young Governess' slight fetish with her employer's wardrobe cupboard.

 Is the large, chatty housekeeper's growing fear for the children developed from her agreement with the young carer's constantly expressed misgivings or is she becoming terrified of the young lady's own obsessions and their effect on her charges?

Is Miles, the dapper little boy under her care, a roguish but vulnerable young charmer recently and tragically orphaned of both parents or a manipulative future monster-in-the-making presently apprenticed to an evil phantom?

  Finally,  Bolt's tribute to the author is made clear by his even handed approach. For me  he seems to find it difficult to discount either understanding except to realise that such a genuine genius as James is somewhat more a pioneer of the then new psychological side of the literary than a recreator of the literary methods and archetypes from his own cultural past. Inevitably a fiercely partisan view of either take on the story is, I think, useless.  This production is both humble and majestic and is a signature effort by the director and all listed in the credits. The best ""Turn of the Screw"" I have seen.",1108598400,17,2558,5.150121065375303
1078730,5,6305807469,"Any adaptation of a literary work to the screen runs the risk of coming  across as too shallow. Such is not the case in Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's  presentation of ""The Turn of the Screw"". You are immediately  drawn into the psychological horror with its varied twists and turns that  leads to who knows where?
  Identify with the naive character who is  given the responsibility to manage the family affairs of a young bachelor  who refuses to be bothered with his niece and nephew. Beguiled by his  sexually powerful aura, our herione takes on the task. She meets perfectly  sweet children in Flora and Miles. Miles in particular is precocious. He is  also very adept at playing power games that go beyond that of a child  having his or her way. She has the perfect job but there is an unsettling  sense of evil in the manor. Ghosts of the former governess and valet haunt  the scene and ""Miss"" becomes unglued but ever ready to  ""save"" her charges.
  The psychological changes she goes  through hits home. Is she mad? Have these ghost pocessed this children? How  is it that a ten year old boy sounds and acts like a mature man making a  pass at her? How ""Miss"" solves this mystery yet managing to keep  her mind intact is the great challenge. Jodhi May does a splendid job in  her performance as she battles evil that has enveloped the children. Truly  this is a psychological drama befitting our attention. Its horror as to  what has been done to the children is horrifying. Journey with the  character through this dilema. At the beginning of this drama we are given  an introduction as to the background of this story by James. Setting it in  its context makes it all the more chilling for is it indeed fact or  fiction?

1078731,5,6305807469,"""The Turn of the Screw"" is as much a psychological thriller as  it is a ghost story.  This Masterpiece Theatre adaptation is, for the most  part, very faithful to Henry James' text, although it does add some  interesting interpretive touches.  ""Miss"" (portrayed by the  wonderful Jodhi May, with just the right mix of toughness and  vulnerability) is a young governess discovering her identity and her way in  the world for the first time.  Her interview with Bly's owner, which is  mentioned only in passing by James, is portrayed at length here, with a  powerful sense of sexual tension between the youthful ""Miss"" and  the sophisicated lord of the estate.  Indeed, there is a palpable sense of  sexual tension and repression throughout this version, although it is very  discreetly and tastefully handled.  The appearances of ""the  ghosts"" are unsettling without being melodramatic or corny.  I  recommend this version to any fan of James' text, and it would make an  excellent addition to the video libraries of high schools and universities.",961372800,20,1046,5.076923076923077
1078829,4,6305807469,"Imagine you are looking for work and you are hired to be a governess to two young children in a lovely manor. Imagine then that you are told you can never contact the Uncle and must solve all problems yourself.

Colin Firth does a good job at the beginning of the movie and after he hires the governess we never see him again. That was a bit disappointing. However, Jodhi May keeps the movie together herself for the most part. It is when she starts to see the ghosts that things turn chilling.

She spends most of the movie with a terrified look on her face. Everyone is suspect once she decides the children can see the ghosts too but are keeping it a secret. What you have to ask yourself is whether the ghosts are that much of a threat or is a hysterical governess a worse threat.

The end of the movie answers that question. It was not an ending I at all expected. I thought Colin Firth would appear to save the day, but alas no. They really play up the suspense in this movie. Everything seems so pleasant at first. So if you like a suspenseful haunted house drama this might be for you.

If you are watching this to see Colin Firth's brilliant acting I fear you may be disappointed. He is really only in the beginning of the movie, and very briefly.

1078835,4,6305807469,"Henry James' The Turn of the Screw (Penguin Classics) is one of my all-time favorite psychological suspense novels (or supernatural, whichever way you choose to interpret it), and I have watched several adaptations. One of my personal favorites is The Innocents starring Deborah Kerr, which I felt was most faithful to the ambiguous nature of James' text. I have also watched the disturbing The Nightcomers which is not strictly an adaptation of the source, but more of a prequel to the story, based on a novel written by Michael Hastings, The Nightcomers. It stars Marlon Brando as the corrupter Peter Quint and Stephanie Beacham as the doomed Ms. Jessel. Then there's the updated 2009 adaptation starring Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens. Finally, I have managed to watch this 1999 Masterpiece Theatre presentation starring Jodhi May. There are some issues with this adaptation (no one adaptation seems to quite live up to James' text), but overall I thought it had some merits that makes this a recommended watch for fans of the story.

Jodhi May (who has been in many period dramas, such as ""The Woodlanders"", ""Daniel Deronda"", ""The Aristocrats"", ""The House of Mirth"", ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", and ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"") portrays newly-appointed governess ""Miss"" who is instructed by her employer ""Master"" (Colin Firth) to look after his two young charges, Miles (Joe Sowerbutts) and Flora (Grace Robinson) at his English country estate. The one stipulation is that ""Miss"" is not to trouble him with anything and that she is to oversee all matters and problems herself.

Upon her arrival, Miss is warmly welcomed by the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (Pam Ferris) and when she inquires about the previous governess, very little information is forthcoming. Flora (Miles is away at boarding school) is charming and pleasant and Miss finds herself at ease. This ends when she spies a strange man standing atop the stone structure of the house, watching her. Then Miles is sent home for the summer with a letter from his principal explaining Miles has been expelled with no concrete reason given as to why. Things gradually begin to escalate when Miss begins to see not only the man but also the ghostly figure of a woman - it turns out these are Peter Quint and Ms. Jessel, former employees at the house, and they are both dead. To her horror, the governess realizes that her charges' very souls are at stake as they have been corrupted by Quint and Jessel.

The film is very atmospheric with the imposing manor house serving as the backdrop to the strange occurrences. The cinematography and score aptly convey the pervasive sense of gloom and mystery. Jodhi May is credible as the hapless governess who tries so very desperately to keep her charges safe from what she perceives to be supernatural evil. I thought the actor who portrayed Miles was credible in his portrayal of the corrupted child and similarly the little girl Flora. The menace quotient here in terms of genuine scares is not very high but on the whole, this is a well-made production that I rank as one of the better made adaptations of ""The Turn of the Screw.""",1400112000,2,3146,4.909774436090226

1078980,3,6305807469,"This is the Masterpiece Theater version of a story short story by Henry James. It is relatively well done, but it certainly does leave a lot of open questions. Among them is the governess's name: she is just referred to as ""Miss"" throughout the movie. She is hired by a wealthy bachelor to look after his young niece and nephew who have been orphaned and left in his care. He hires her on the condition that he is not to be bothered about the children for any reason. He is seldom at home on his country estate where the children live, and he does not want her to write to him or communicate about the children in any way. So she takes the job knowing that she is completely responsible for all decisions regarding the children.

The golden-haired children seem to be little angels at first, but there's something dark and mysterious about them. Unfortunately, all discussions with the housekeeper on the subject of what is wrong are done in typically Victorian euphemism and innuendo. We get the distinct impression it has something to do with sex, and the appearance of two ghosts, the master's former valet and the former governess (who opened the movie with a scene of her drowning herself) is clearly involved. In exactly what way is mostly left to the audience's imagination.

The situation grows spookier and spookier, and the question arises: is the governess losing her marbles, or is all this really happening? Is she reading too much into certain events, such as the letter from the boy's school which informs them that the boy has been expelled, but does not say why. A dark undertone appears in the children's personalities, and they are often whispering together in ways that the audience can almost, but not quite, overhear. But the governess' behavior is pretty inexplicable, too.

It is, after all, a ghost story, but one that is unique to the genre. I enjoyed it, for all my frustrations in interpretation. Or perhaps because of it, since the ambiguity was clearly part of the author's intention.",1337385600,2,2014,4.748571428571428

Knowing the plot quite well I did not find the movie particularly scary but for someone unfamiliar or who hasn't read the book in awhile there could be some real chills.  And as is so often true in ghost stories the more the movie shows of the spirits the less frightening they become and the viewer gets some real good looks at both Peter Quint and Miss Jessel.

However, as 21st century filmmakers should know by now:  modern and newer is not necessarily better. And less is more as the producers should have realized when they considered this remake. In the outstanding and remarkable 1961 adaptation ""The Innocents"" the ghosts or apparitions are for the most part seen briefly and at a distance. Music, sound effects, and stunning cinematography made the apparitions and children's precocious behavior even more chilling and disconcerting. This drama doesn't work for the following reasons: the ghosts are revealed close-up, in realistic and lingering shots. They are neither mysterious nor frightening. The children are unappealing and not terribly convincing; in other words very badly cast. And most surprisingly, the very talented Jodhi May who should have been perfect for this role is somehow simultaneously grim and blank from the beginning; she gives us little insight into her character.

Since it deals with children, the presence of children tightens the dramatic tension: if you turn a screw too tightly, something is going to break, either the screw itself or the item attached to it.
A governess is hired to take care of a man's niece and nephew, their parents being dead. A condition of hire is that she is not to contact her employer for any reason, including any problem that she might have. She has to take care of everything herself. She arrives at the very large and rich mansion and soon discovers that the boy is a problem child and has been expelled from school, although he is very polite to her. She does not know how he is a problem. More significantly, she sees the ghosts of two former servants of the mansion, both of whom are dead. She believes that the two children also can see the ghosts and that they communicate with the ghosts.

7895429,4,6305807469,"This adaptation is very faithful indeed with the characters, the setting, the various moments of the story, apparitions of the ghosts included. The film is also clear about the parents of the kids, the mother died of yellow fever, we assume in India, and the father died on duty in India too one year late. But the film, like Henry James novella, does not capture the tremendous trauma the children must have gone through and then  the film is clear about that  Miss Jessel got pregnant which made her have to go, to be let go by the Master. Pregnant from whom? The situation implies from Peter Quint. But the first double trauma of the children is now amplified by a second double trauma with Mis Jessel going away and dying, by suicide as the opening scene shows, closely followed by Peter Quint dying in some kind of accident, fake or not does not matter. And strangely enough only the nameless governess is traumatized by these facts and she is led into seeing ghosts that no one else sees.

The film insists on this aspect of the character. She is getting little by little haunted  but in her sole mind  by her two predecessors. The kids are at an age  and their having gone through these two double traumas helps  when they can capture the fears of adults and they can get motivated to play on these fears, for fun or in this case for liberation.

The governess becomes a power and control freak and she transforms teaching into taming wild animals if not beasts. She sees them perverted while she is the one who is perverted. The film is discreet on this side of things though Henry James insisted on the governesss hugging, kissing, holding hands, embracing, etc., with Miles particularly. She was obviously falling in love with Miles and wanted to possess him so strongly that he would became part of her own self. She was cannibalistic in her unjustified love for Miles. To love a child is a lot more challenging than to love an adult because the child cannot answer, cannot say no, cannot run away and when Miles tries the governess does not understand. The film insists on that but not on the sentimental, emotional and physical love of the governess towards Miles that is definitely desire and this desire is somewhere felt as wrong, evil is her word, so she has to repress it and the ghosts are her tools to transfer her repressive desire against her perverse impulse onto the object of this pedophile lust, hence onto Miles, and accidentally Flora.

She literally tortures the kids with the ghosts, till the very end, though Benjamin Britten does a far better job with that last scene about being alone and how the governess is understanding the ambiguity of the situation on which Miles is playing full blast, and it works. Thats what the two kids show us in the film very clearly: they are playing with the governess like two cats and one mouse. She falls in the trap every single time and she ends up being a fool. But that fool is criminal.

The film here centers this last scene on the last breath of Miles. He is more or less dragged by the governess into her arms and into an embrace and here the films innovates because the call for Quint, you devil, Where are you, where are you? is a call for help when Miles sees his end is close, the praying manta has captured him. But Quint won't be able to come because he is no where, near or far, he is no longer one of them. And the film is clear when it shows the governess embraces Miles to death, till death parts him from his life, and Miles is just plainly choked to death. No ambiguity, no fuzziness. She is a criminal and she was brought there by the size of the responsibility she was entrusted with and she could not cope with and up to.

Well done, well directed, well performed, the film is impressive, though in no way frightening. We are horrified by the governesss fall into crime because of her repressed and unaccepted feelings and desires for a boy under her own educational responsibility. She is depicted as a closet pedophile who ends up killing the child she wants to possess, including physically. I am afraid though this takes a lot of mystery from the story without modernizing the vision. Such facts are rare in the concerned world of education, and in fact I just wonder if they are in proportion more important in this world than in the wide society around.

Note there is a mistake on the back sleeve of the DVD: the children are not those of the charming bachelor because he is only the guardian and they are his nephew and niece. But, well, a child is a child, though exiling ones own children to a country house with not contact with their father would be more than unnatural  which it is here  but definitely inhumane and even barbaric.
