3666463,5,B001KL3GX6,I was so excited when my sister told me the UPS truck was coming to deliver my Byou 2 video. I want you to know that I absolutely love it. It is sooo awesome. I love the very nice and slow step by that is given by both Sabrina Bryan and Rujuta Vaidya. I totally enjoy it! Sabrina teaches the hip hop part and Ruj teaches the Bollywood part then it gets put togetherin another part of the video. There are bonus features too.  With Byou 2 I am destined to look great in my swim suit this summer! Do you have your Byou 2 yet?,1231977600,,523,3.9339622641509435

8315284,5,B001KL3GX6,Great product!,1409270400,,14,6.5
8315285,3,B001KL3GX6,Ordered for my 11 yr old. She got discouraged at how fast the dance was being taught. This would be a better video for girls with dance experience.,1326499200,,147,4.285714285714286
8315286,4,B001KL3GX6,"I haven't been a tween since the Partridge Family was on the air, but I love dance workouts and have been getting into both hip-hop and Bollywood dancing.  If you have a little patience to learn the moves, Byou 2 is a fun way to learn both.

The DVD is made up of various segments: an introduction by Sabrina, a Bollywood-style warmup by Ruj that shows some of the basic movements, instructional segments by both Ruj and Sabrina, one segment where they teach together and a full-blast segment.  In the instructionals, they demonstrate the dances in parts at half-speed, then run through it several times.  But unlike in the Fame dance workout, there is music going throughout the instruction.  The moves can be a little complicated, and call for some flexibility and stamina (a few jumps during the hip-hop part) but both Sabrina and Ruj instruct well and are very enthusiastic without overdoing it.  They don't show any modifications, but it's very easy to modify on your own, such as leaving out the jumps and spins.  Music is better than on many DVDs.

This is a very fun and underrated workout for all ages, without skimpy outfits or ""get sexy"" or ""get a bikini body"" messages.",1300233600,3,1181,4.699029126213592
8315287,4,B001KL3GX6,"Bought this for my nine year old daughter. She was a little discouraged at first because it seemed too hard, but once I joined in with her, she got the hang of it.  Neither one of us can do it up to speed, but it's lots of fun at half speed!!!",1241308800,2,243,3.764705882352941
8315288,5,B001KL3GX6,My two tween age daughters and I love working out together to this video. It's a great way to spend time together having fun and getting fit. And the empowering words which have always been a part of Sabrina Bryan's career are represented in this video as well. A really fun video with some new Bollywood moves and of course the charismatic Sabrina and Ruj. You will love it!!,1235520000,,376,4.463768115942029
8315289,5,B001KL3GX6,"This is an excellent workout.  The moves are Bollywood dancing and Sabrina has come up with a fun energetic workout.  I am not a pre-teen, but still loved it!",1235433600,,158,4.413793103448276
8315290,5,B001KL3GX6,"I loved this dvd.  It has interesting music and dance styles plus it is also really fun.  Sabrina has so much energy and the choregraphy of the Indian dances made it even more special.  I've always admired Sabrina's message of girl empowerment and that is shown all over this dvd as well.  I highly recommend it for boys and girls, young and older.  A good workout with a smile on your face.",1235088000,,391,4.375
8315291,5,B001KL3GX6,"I love this workout!!! I am well over the tween age but this video is for everyone! The beginning pace is very easy to follow and the warm ups even easier. For anyone who loves working out hip hop style or anyone who is fascinated with Bollywood style dance (like me) I highly recommend this! Sabrina Bryan and Bollywood choreographer Rujuta Vaidya make a great team! The meaning that is drilled into the viewer over and over is, in Sabrina's own words ""BYou 2 is all about being comfortable with who you are and having the confidence to do anything you want to do"" Feeling good about yourself and getting fit and having fun doing it. That is what it is all about!",1231977600,7,664,4.40650406504065
