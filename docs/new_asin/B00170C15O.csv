3165550,5,B00170C15O,"If you want a good workout without a lot of nonsense and cute and fancy dance moves, this is it.  Kelly gets to the basics of toning and firming, with easy moves that you will feel, especially if you keep increasing your weight.  Worth every penny.",1238976000,3,248,4.369565217391305
3165551,5,B00170C15O,"30 Minutes Fitness Weights is a gem for the amazing variety it manages to pack in and the fun, effective exercises. You can do the two strength workouts with three ""active rest"" options between sets - floor abs, standing abs and low impact cardio. All three are great choices, but standing abs is Kelly's forte and my favorite. There are several wonderful premixes which makes it versatile no matter what style of rotation you are following. The two 30 minute workouts and shorter premizes are wonderful for tight on time days for getting the most juice out of the time you have. You can do every exercise on the DVD through for a 70 minute workout that will get you in fabulous shape. On days when I deicde I need a quick workout and pop this in, I frequently find myself doing more than I planned by doing another little bit or even the whole thing through. Time flies.

The strength exercises themselves are classics but with a fresh twist. Very interesting to do and they can shake up routine by recruiting muscles that are not often used like the side deadlifts.

I love Kelly's music choices and her personality if high energy but in a quiet way. She isn't chatty. She just radiates energy and has a glowing smile that lights up her face. She is natural and unfussy in front of the camera. She also has the best option for modifiers in all her workouts versus other instructors I am familiar with. They are never boring, watered down, afterthought moves but as effective and fun as the ""full"" move.",1236988800,5,1504,4.546125461254612
3165552,5,B00170C15O,I work out a lot so I am always looking for new ways to change things up. Kelly gives a very effective workout in just 30 minutes. I love the way she incorporates the active rests. GREAT IDEA!!,1236729600,,193,4.105263157894737
3165553,5,B00170C15O,"This was the first workout in fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's new 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Weights offers two separate splits-style workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is approximately 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, additional options allow you to create a longer workout as well as to add in lots of variety (described below).

Kelly works out with two background exercises, one of whom shows modifications for some of the exercises. The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up, Workout 1, Workout 2, Workout Sections, and Premixes; there are also audio options for working out with music or with Kelly's voice only. In her introduction, Kelly explains that the workouts are designed for heavier lifting.  She recommends that beginners use 5 lbs., intermediate 7 lbs., and advanced 10 lbs. (note that these weight amounts are different than what is is listed on the DVD menu).  I found these amounts to be about right, as I consider myself to be high intermediate, and I used 8 lbs. through the majority of both workouts, sometimes pyramiding up to 10 lbs.

The basic 3-minute warm-up includes marches, taps with reaches, side steps, and hamstring curls.  Without the warm-up, Workout #1, which focuses on Back, Legs, & Chest, is 29.5 minutes long, and Workout #2, concentrating on Biceps, Triceps, & Shoulders, is 27 minutes long. Both workouts follow the same general format:  a single exercise consisting of 8 repetitions is performed for each of the three targeted body parts.  This round is then repeated once, and then you take an ""active rest.""  The active rests are 1-minute periods of standing ab work; these are fast-paced and hardly feel like a ""rest,"" but they're a fun break from the strength work.  Two more strength rounds and two more rest periods follow, and then there's just a few very brief stretches to finish.  Kelly moves quickly from exercise to exercise in both workouts--don't be surprised if your heart rate stays up the whole time.  As always, she adds a lot of unique twists to to the exercises, such as hesitation holds, deadlifts with a twist, and some challenging push-up/plank moves.  She also manages to sneak in additional strength work during the so-called rests (ie, one of the rests includes plies to work the legs).

The Premixes on this DVD provide a great amount of variety to the workouts.  The first four premixes feature the workouts exactly as above, with the only changes being to the active rest portions.  For the first two premixes, the active rest portions in both workouts are replaced by 2 minutes of floor abdominal work (exercises include leaning rows with lifts, knee tuck crunches, full sit-ups with arm reaches, frog-leg crunches, and side leg crunches).  For the next two premixes, the active rest portions in both workouts are replaced by low-cardio segments, including simple moves such as v-steps, knee repeaters, side-steps, hamstring pulls, toe taps, and lunges.  Each of these premixes remains about 30 minutes in length.

There are also three additional premixes as follows:
Full Body--1 rotation of each exercise (38m)
Mixed Full Body Blast--no active rests (41m)
Time-Saver Full Body Blast--2 exercises each body part w/no rests (31m)

As with the other DVDs in her 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Kelly did a great job in this video, which provides users with plenty of workout options. Overall, I give this 4 1/2 stars!",1233187200,240,3515,4.977777777777778
3165554,5,B00170C15O,"I use this as a warm-up before my morning run. (I know typically you'd do the cardio first, but I found I feel stronger on my runs and walks if I do this short strength routine first) The 30 minute - all body parts, no active rest routine is my favorite. Kelly is enthusiastic but not as sacharine or peppy as some of video instructors. I was using the 15 pound weights as she recommended for advanced audiences but found I was starting to bulk up, so dropped down to the 10 pound weights. The deadlifts and squats offer a good way to both stretch and strengthen.",1230336000,38,563,4.271028037383178
3165555,4,B00170C15O,"While I like this workout, I certainly have better workouts from Kelly.  This one is good though for your abs and upper body.  There are two main workouts here and both are about 30 minutes all up.  They are tough and leave you feeling it the next day (or two) but sticking to it will definately give you results.
The first workout is for chest, back and your legs and the second one is for shoulders and biceps and triceps.  I like the music that's used here because I find it motivating.  There is also an additional ab section which is helpful and good to do.  I feel that this is lacking upper body work like flies and chest presses.  It almost seems a little incomplete, yet doing this is obviously better than not doing any work at all.
Kelly is encouraging and outgoing but not annoying.  This dvd gets it done in a short amount of time but you will certainly feel the burn and yet have fun at the same time.",1209168000,64,915,4.2485549132947975
3165556,5,B00170C15O,"Kelly's Amped Cardio Live workouts are so much fun!  The time flies by and it's over before you know it.  The majority of the reviews on here are for an older Kelly weight lifting workout - they need to fix this!

I love that there are modified versions of every move. It has kickboxing as well, which is one of my favorite types of exercise. This DVD alternates between cardio and sculpting so it's never one for a long period of time. Great workout!",1485648000,2,374,4.597014925373134
3165574,5,B00170C15O,"This is a great video for anyone (I was going to say beginner, but it's really great for anyone) who knows they need to add strength training to their routine, but doesn't want to spend 3 hours at the gym doing it. I knew I needed to, but wasn't really enthused as I find working with weights to be time consuming and boring. There are multiple 30-minute routines on this DVD so you can change things up, and the 30 minute aspect is super appealing for those (read: me) who want to get a short cardio routine in the same day but have no desire to spend multiple hours of my life each day working out.

The most impressive thing this video did was made me really appreciate what strength training can do not just for my appearance but most noticeably my energy level. Even after only a 30-45 minute session (yes, she has a couple of longer routines included), I can literally *feel* the metabolic effects of the routine for hours after I've finished. That kind of feeling is completely non-existent with any cardio work I do, so I know the video is worthwhile and even makes me look forward to doing it (a little bit - I mean, working out is just a necessary evil to me :P).

I definitely consider this a worthwhile purchase! :)",1484784000,23,1227,4.37719298245614
3165575,5,B00170C15O,"I have most of Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness DVD's. She is awesome. I have lost over 20 pounds in the last six months due to her unique workouts. I preordered this DVD a few months ago and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I received it today and just finished watching it. I am not unhappy with my purchase but was thrown a bit by the live format. The exercises themselves though (all cardio) were great. It was the quality of the production itself that was a bit off. The lighting was dark to me, the sound was uneven and I felt everything moved too fast. The end credits also misspelled the word cardio. Very odd. Anyway, with that said I will be popping it into the DVD player in the morning to actually workout. I love Kelly and her usual workout buddies Sam, Lori and Noelle and look forward as always to working out with them.
This is an update to my earlier review. I actually worked out this morning to Amped up Cardio and it was great. Once I got going, the lighting, sound and pace no longer bothered me. I am changing my 4 stars to 5 even with the word cardio misspelled in the end credits! I love KCM!",1483660800,3,1125,4.2372093023255815

3165584,5,B00170C15O,"I will be honest: when I first bought this DVD I was quite disappointed.  It seemed too choreographed to provide a great, sweaty workout for someone as uncoordinated as I am.  I love Kelly's weight and boxing-based workouts, but this one seemed to be beyond my (clumsy) ability to follow, even aftrer repeated viewings of the tutorials.  Then one day about a year ago, I was flipping through my DVDs looking for some cardio to tack onto 30 minutes of my beloved Body Shop.  I pulled this DVD out and did the kicks premix only.  I was able to follow it when I wasn't worried about what my arms were supposed to be doing.  Over the course of the next several weeks, I faithfully practiced until I was able to follow both routines with little trouble.  I still find myself on the wrong leg from time to time; but these are drills that are repeated for two minutes.  We are not talking about a complicated step sequence here.  I have recently added one pound gloves and they really amp up the intensity.  My goal is to complete both routines combined before the end of the year without dropping dead.  If like me, you have shelved this DVD because of the choreography, pull it out and try again.  Try one section at a time and be patient with yourself.  I love Kelly's Kickboxing now.",1476403200,,1280,4.44206008583691

3165624,4,B00170C15O,"This is one of the earlier videos in the 30 Minutes to Fitness workout series led by Kelly Coffey-Meyer.  It is a boot camp workout, where you alternate weight and cardio segments for two minutes each.  In many of her videos she sticks with the one minute format, but deviates a little bit here.

I wasn't sure I would like this workout to be honest but I do.  The weight segments are done in compound fashion mostly, where you are working upper and lower body at the same time.  In many instances I find compound movements to be clumsy and awkward, probably because I don't execute them very gracefully.  I find working one body part at a time easier, but working multiple ones together is more time efficient.  Here I found the compound segments to be done well and not overly awkward or confusing.

The cardio segments are pretty high in impact at times, but thankfully Kelly has a great modifier in Lauren and I follow her without shame.  I have never cared for high impact, running or jogging of any sort.  Frankly I would rather poke my eye out with a hot fork!  So those of us who are not high impact fans?  We can do this workout too!

I could say that this workout uses an assortment of light to moderate weights, due to the pace and compound format I could not go very heavy and that's fine.  I just treat this as a lighter weight workout.  I find some of her other workouts to be the same for me, such as Trim Down.  I used anywhere from 3 lbs to 8 lbs mostly.

As always, Kelly includes great premixes, if you want to just do weights?  Or just cardio?  Pick those premixes.  She also includes a longer stretch segment in the workout which is nice.

Seasoned Kelly fans tend to prefer her Circuit Burn workout over this one, personally I like Bootcamp better.  I like the music and find it to be more lively for some reason.

I rate this workout 4 and a half stars!",1452988800,,1876,4.312320916905444

What I most like about her videos is that it may not feel super hard during the workout, but boy do I feel it the next day! I didn't realize how much my obliques would feel the what I considered ""simple"" ab moves she has you do in between sets. Whew. Hurting. I like that, I don't want to be so sore I can't move, but I want to know I worked hard and she gives you that. I also really appreciate how she coaches you along in the video. She isn't obnoxious at all- some workout videos are so obnoxious and I can barely get through them because of the trainer. Kelly is great. I also appreciate the women in the videos- they look like normal women and not super fit women with abs of steel that I'm never going to have.

Overall I like the videos. I've only used them once or twice so I can speak to any changes to my body yet, but I'm confident that if I use them often, I'll see results.",1451952000,5,1023,3.9902439024390244

3165635,4,B00170C15O,"The music awkwardly fades out and slows down at the end of each circuit, which makes me want to taper off on the last couple of reps when, instead, I should be working the hardest to maintain good form! Then, it is awkwardly silent between circuits as Kelly provides instructions for the next circuit. The music then jarringly starts up again, often in a completely unrelated tempo. Also, the music is pretty cheesy... there is even fake cheering in one of the tracks. So... the music and music editing in this video is bad. There are ways to manipulate the tempo without stopping it altogether, as well as ways to make tempo changes feel more natural!

However, I'm not ready to give up on this one yet. The workouts consist of an interesting mix of cardio, resistance training, and shadowboxing. My favorite part of the DVD is the bonus abs segment, which I'm sure I will use often. I'm interested to see how I can combine the 10 pre-mixes into my routine.

3165639,5,B00170C15O,"I received this DVD a week ago and have been doing it everyday since. I love it! Kelly offers a traditional weight lifting workout routine which is meant to increase strength, rev up your metabolism, tighten and tone. The DVD is divided into 2 separate 30-minute very effective workouts ...
back/chest/legs on one and biceps/triceps/shoulders on another and then a separate killer abs routine. Her pace is slow enough to keep up and keep your form but she doesn't stop at all for each 30-minute segment. Even in your ""active rest"" period you are moving.
She offers some different exercises that I haven't seen before which I like. She does the workout with two women - one doing advanced moves and the other modified - which is good since there are a lot of pushups and she does them on her knees.  I consider myself an intermediate level with weights and am using 8-10 lbs. Very challenging. I feel sore but not a ""pulled a muscle"" soreness - more of a ""worked the muscles"" feeling.
I don't think anyone will tire of the DVD. If an exercise becomes too easy you can increase the weights. And the abs routine is so challenging that most people will take quite a long time to fully complete it. Something to strive for!
If you're trying to get muscular definition and  lose some stubborn fat - this is the DVD that will speed the process. Obviously diet is important too but I feel confident that this DVD plus mindful eating will get fast results.",1442620800,2,1447,4.561538461538461

She barely gives any instructions, spends most of the time on cardio and barely uses any of the weights. She changes between movements very fast and doesn't give time to adjust. She is also annoyingly repetitive as you end up doing the same 5 movements for the 30 minutes. Yes, you do break a sweat (after all the cardio who wouldn't)- but the DVD should be called : ""30 minutes of cardio"",  not circuit burn- as you do not circle through diverse movements.

In general, I tend to think they are all good workouts, but not all of them are for me and my exercise style and/or fit my exercise limitations.  This DVD, however, is one that I just can't get into - and I'm not sure why.

As with the other DVDs in the series, this DVD gives the option of two 30-minute workouts along with a bonus stretch that a lot of people have raved about over the years and premixes.  In both workouts, you do a mixture of cardio, conditioning, and strength moves, often in a drill format.  You do each move for 2 minutes - although, in many cases, she'll start out with a base moves and then add variations and additional aspects throughout the 2 minutes.  Many of the moves are sports based (hitting a ball, catching a ball, shooting a ball, throwing a ball, etc.).

There is a LOT of high impact in these workouts.  But, Lauren offers a lot of modifications, ones that left me feeling like I was working out because they weren't lame or afterthoughts.  Kelly is backed up by two background exercises and Lauren is one of them.  Kelly constantly encourages you to do what's good for you - in terms of impact, weights, etc.

In writing this review, I wonder why I don't like the workout because it sounds great.  So, understand me.  I think that it's well done and I think that it will legitimately appeal to a lot of people.  I think that the workouts are just hard on my joints and I don't enjoy the bootcamp format.

This is one that I have kept because I enjoy it and find it motivating.  The two 30 minute workouts are separate splits-style workouts.  Usually, I prefer full-body strength workouts but I like this DVD because I find Kelly motivating in these workouts and because the premixes offer a couple of different options for a full-body workout.  It's a great use of the premix technology.

A lot of the premixes center around giving different options for active rest portions, options for different types of moves between the strength segments. The next three premixes give options for different mixes that give a full-body workout.

In these workouts, Kelly is backed up by two background exercisers; Lauren is the modifier, although she does less modifications than in some other workouts. These workouts are designed to be heavy strength workouts and I use a set of heavier weights (8-10 pounds at this point) and a set of lighter weights (5-8 pounds at this point).  Kelly recommends that beginners use 5 lbs., intermediate 7 lbs., and advanced 10 lbs. I'm coming back from a bad fitness year last year and have moved from beginner level into intermediate territory.

3165673,4,B00170C15O,"Last year, I lost a ton of fitness, so this year I've restarted trying to regain fitness capacity.  I started with about 15 minute workouts and have worked up to 40-45 minutes max.  In the process, I've built up my cardio capacity and strength.  I'm still not to where I want to be, but it's nice to see improvement.  At this point in time, I'm looking for workouts that engage me and encourage me to work out for longer and harder than I have been able to for a long time and it's working.

When this DVD was anounced, I was surprised at my interest because I don't have a workout machine.  But, I immediately wondered if I could use my gliding disks with this workout - doing my own thing sliding around the room while they are all on their cardio machines.  After trying both workouts on the DVD, the results are mixed.  I did each of the workouts and enjoyed them both - but I wondered if I would pull out the DVD again in the next few months to do them again.  I guess only time will tell.  I used my gliding disks and my Fitstix.  It occurred to me that I could wear light hand weights to enhance the level of effort during the cardio sections.  This conflicted feeling means that I think that the workouts are well done and worth doing - if you click with them.

Kelly leads these workouts on a bright and fairly plain set. She encourages you to use whatever machine you have and gives multiple examples: she and Sam are on treadmills; Lori uses an elliptical, and Marcus is on a spin bike. Both workouts are basically the same pattern - warm up on the machine, do a cardio interval for 1.5 minutes and then one strength move for a minute, and finally cool down on the machine.  I liked the first workout more than the second; I thought the strength moves were a bit more fun in the first. Most of the time, you need just one dumbbell, although there were a few moves that used two.  So, all you need for the workout is something for the cardio and 2 dumbbells.

Throughout the workouts, Kelly gives tips and form pointers for the different machines.  She also tells people on treadmills to follow Sam in getting on and off the treadmill because she, Kelly, gets on and off at full speed while Sam slows the treadmill down before getting off.  I'm not sure though that they always showed Sam at those times.

Overall, I liked these workouts and thought some of the strength moves were fun, especially the hot potato squat and the dumbbell throw (although I didn't let go of it).  The strength segments seemed short since they were only 1 minute, so you always seemed to be moving, either on or off the cardio machines.  For those who like to longer sets, this pattern might not be very good. The fact that I was getting on and off gliding disks made it easier to move quickly.  I was engaged throughout the workouts, but I wonder if this might be a short-term like - I might get tired of these workouts sooner rather than later.  We'll see.",1428364800,,2947,4.327868852459017

Lately I have been dealing with some personal changes and health issues that make me more interested in working out at home rather than driving 30 minutes to the nearest gym in my area and having to stick to the rigidity of exercise class schedules.  Yet I need help with motivation when it comes to weights -- I know how important strength training is but I really have a hard time getting motivated to do it on my own.  Sometimes you just need a push, you know?  Well it isn't hard to motivate myself to put this dvd on, and once it plays Kelly and the format of the workout keep me engaged.  A few hand weights and a small towel are the only pieces of equipment you need, and dialing the intensity up or down to suit your fitness level is easily accomplished with weight selection or by modifying the moves as demonstrated.  There are a few exercises that don't suit me very well, but I can easily substitute a different exercise that targets the same muscle group and still keep up with the dvd.

Maybe I am just too picky about form, but the ""tutorial"" section, where I went for instruction before attempting to keep up, consisted of Meyer repeatedly demonstrating the moves by just naming them and doing them. There were no details about, for example, what your core / low back / pelvis should be doing, breathing,  or even how much, if any, twist  from elbow or wrist should be present in a ""jab."" In fact, the first tutorial direction is to start in your fight stance.  However, there is no description of how your weight should be distributed, angle of feet/knees, etc. Without a proper tutorial I was not about to attempt to keep up with fast-paced routines and either hurt something or get very little benefit.  If you are someone who does not pick up nuances in form from looking at someone, and/or if you are concerned about twisting or hurting something (esp low back) I would not recommend.",1406332800,2,1050,4.684782608695652

3165741,5,B00170C15O,"I really did love this one but for some reason when I try to do the whole workout,I find myself watching the clock-maybe because it is hard. I usually hate boxing moves but the way she splits it up between punches and strength moves makes it tolerable. Each half hour workout is truly a sweatfest so I usually do one on a day that I have less time but want to feel like I did something. Thats why I love
Kelly's workouts-even if you choose to do only a half hour,you feel empowered because you did something. I have 3 kids and don't always have time for a long workout. For some reason I thought I'd hate this one but I'm glad I took a chance!",1390608000,3,643,4.111111111111111

This DVD is an excellent choice for girls like me who are 40+ and not ""athletic"" in the sense of the word. This workout is very challenging, yet Kelly does not burn you out with endless repetitions and long, drawn out sets. She has a knack of quitting or giving you a break JUST AT THE POINT WHEN YOU WANT TO QUIT! Then you are good to go again and she changes the intensity or muscle groups that you are exercising, so you don't get too fatigued. She seems to know just what to do and when to do it. She has a great way of giving cues before you go on to the next move so that you are not just standing there wondering what's going on. I have several of Kelly's workout DVDs and the change to my body and diet motivation has been amazing. I highly recommend Kelly.

3165749,5,B00170C15O,"This DVD provides a challenging, effective, and fun work-out! With consistent practice, it produces visible results as well as an increase in physical stamina. Coffey-Meyer has created a series of pre-mixed routines that begin with warm-up stretches and calisthenics and accommodate beginner, intermediate, and advanced weight training programs. Her approach is engaging, no-nonsense, and wry. Because of the variety of pre-mixed work-outs (alternately targeting arms, back, abs, legs), it is unlikely the program will lose its edge or become boring. Used in combination with specific stretching routines (for example, Pilates), it makes for a well-rounded program of strength and flexibility training. I have tried other DVD programs and this is by far the most effective and enjoyable. No program works unless it is engaging enough to invite commitment and consistency. This one does, hands down!",1384128000,8,898,5.659259259259259

This workout is good and gets the job done quickly, but I didn't find it challenging enough and became bored with it pretty quickly.  There is only one workout per muscle group (total of 2) plus the ab workout, so if you exercise regularly like I do, you may find you need more than one DVD to keep things mixed up. On the plus side, the ab workout is one of the best 10 minutes I have spent training my core.

Coming off of my knee injury I wasn't sure if this was too advanced, but for the first week I was 90%  right in step with Kelly.  Kelly is not a talker which is great, she tells you where you should feel it and just encourages you with simple commands. She has a smooth segue from section to section and it makes the time fly.  Plus the music is very, very low so I can focus on the instructors and not be distracted.  The movements are simple and clean, since I am a long time weight lifter, but oh so effective - much more than I expected.

Yes, the transitions are less than smooth, and the women in the video look tough, but the workout itself is just what I was looking for.  There are 2 main workouts (back/legs/chest or biceps/triceps/shoulders) and these are mixed into many variations so that there are 7 workouts overall.  Kelly Coffey-Meyer has active rests of a few variations including focusing on either cardio or the abs.  The workouts are short (not over 30 minutes for most) and feel effective.  The moves are simple.  Kelly Coffey-Meyer style is straight forward and not too peppy.  You choose your own level by how heavy the weights are.  I think the overall level is intermediate, though you can adjust the level by increasing/reducing weight used and effort put forth during the active rests.  The video is geared toward weight lifting so it's a nice change from pure cardio, and because it's mixed with active rests, I feel like I'm getting more for my time.",1372550400,4,1127,4.646464646464646

For strength, she uses a combination of weights and again does combination moves.  Kelly explains the moves very well and is encouraging without being irritating.  This DVD contains two different 30 minute boot camp segments and a variety of pre-mixes.  I thought this was an excellent workout and felt that I'd really gotten a full dose of exercise in just 30 minutes.",1352505600,5,821,5.120300751879699
3165803,1,B00170C15O,"I'm not an athlete, but I am not at beginner fitness level either. I purchased this DVD several months ago. I love kickboxing and couldn't wait for the item to arrive. When it got here, I popped the DVD in, took my fighter stance and was ready to sweat. All I ended up doing was getting frustrated and confused.

My main gripe with this DVD is the complicated choreography. I was so aggravated with trying to keep up with all of the different moves that I've placed this DVD on my movie shelf where it is collecting dust. As I said before, I'm no stranger to kickboxing. I know my jabs from my under cuts! The problem lies in the fact that the instructor combines moves that are not fluid and easy to transition into. One second, your right leg is in the air and the next second she wants your left leg behind you and then just to really complicate it all, drop into a lunge.

I don't believe in giving up, so I kept trying to learn the choreography. To date, I still can't do half of the moves. Not because they are too hard, they just don't transition well and I always seem to be a step or two behind. I can pop in any of my other workout DVDs (including kickboxing DVDs) and I have no problem.

Normally, if I don't like a product, I don't post about it. What I hate, maybe others will love. But I really feel a need to warn others about this DVD. There are too many other great workout DVDs out there to waste your money on this one.",1351296000,12,1438,4.146953405017921
3165804,1,B00170C15O,"I bought this based on the good reviews.  I bought it for the 30 minute all in one workout and it was awful.  The woman looked incredibly masculine.  The woman that was leading it didn't control her weights properly she was using her body to lift them rather than using muscle control and I didn't like the exercises she used with the leg behind.  The girl in the back on the left with blondy/brown hair had much better form with all the exercises.  The disc was scratched as well, so I sent it back.  I did body building for 8 years doing 4 to 6 day split routines and cycling, swimming and running in between and even competed at one stage so I know what I like and this dvd was not it.",1349827200,9,688,4.135338345864661
3165805,3,B00170C15O,"I tried this dvd out today.  It contains two basic workouts and a mix of those two workouts.  And, here is the issue. I believe the mix of workouts is accomplished by editing and splicing together pieces of the two main workouts.  I say this because there were awkward stops/starts in the video and audio throughout the mixed workouts.  I don't believe the dvd is malfunctioning.  I just think it is a poor job of splicing and editing or whatever the technology is to mix up the workouts.  I may return this item.  I bought two other Coffey dvd's and will try them out in the next few days to see if there is a similar problem before making up my mind.  Otherwise, the only annoying thing is that she tries to do her own audio instructions during the workout.  I believe it works out better if the person/persons doing the workouts are not doing the talking.  That way there is more flow.",1347408000,,888,4.392638036809816

For this video, you have to learn some complex choreography in order to do the moves. I believe there IS a training section where they teach the moves. But I don't want to have to prepare BEFORE I do the workout. I attempted to do the workout without the ""Pre"" workout prep and I'm decently coordinated, but I couldn't follow a lot of it, and I barely broke a sweat.

It is not an easy workout by any means but not so difficult that a beginner can't do it with lighter weights and good old determination.  She gives really good instructions to help with your form while working out.  The DVD consists of a warm-up, a 30 minute uppper body workout and a second 30 minute lower body workout.  Beginners are to start with 7lb. weights, intermediate needs 10 lb., and advance needs 15 lb. weights. You are encouraged to go heavier with the weights if you can.  The rest period in these workouts is 1 minute of abdomenal work that is pretty intense. If you want a really good weight workout, this is it.",1344124800,,708,4.415384615384616

My favorite workout (pre-mix) is the 41 minute full body, which I currently do with 10 lb dumbbells and will soon be moving up to 15.  I highly recommend this dvd for women who want to add strength training days to their workouts but who don't have a gym membership or just don't like going to the gym.  You can start out with smaller weights and work your way up to heavy, or you can switch from heavy to lighter depending on which muscles are being worked.  I also recommend Rob Glick's weight training video (a little longer and a includes some faster/cardio like segments, but also uses a step).",1335830400,,759,4.544117647058823

I have this and Kelly's kickboxing workout and am very pleased with the purchase.  As so many other reviewers have mentioned, Kelly is very comfortable to work out with - especially in comparison to some of the other more popular trainers.  I still do P90X and Insanity, but after many months of both, I needed to mix it up a bit.  I believe this is perfect for people doing a supplemental workout, for those limited in time and for those beginner to intermediate exercisers.

I love how it transitions quickly from one exercise to the next, making the best use of my time.  I personally don't need a lot of talk, unless it's reminding me of correct form, queuing the next move, or counting the number of reps. Do the workout once or twice and that's all you need to catch on.  The one thing I miss is a count down clock for the entire workout or for the set.

3165821,5,B00170C15O,"I really like Kelly Coffey-Meyer and have collected most of her 30 Minutes to Fitness series.  I don't have many kickboxing videos so naturally I had to add this one to my library.  I must say it is one of my favorites.

I will be honest, it did take me a few tries to get down but once you get it, lots of fun.  She does include a tutorial that goes through all the combinations slowly, which really helped me.

There are 2 - 30 minute workouts.  You generally do a combination for 2 minutes, then move on to the next one and repeat.  You see quite a variety in kicking and punching moves, but I found that all the combinations flowed nicely and none of them were too complicated once you get the hang of it.

There are a handful of premixes included on this DVD, including a kick mix and punch mix, among others.  There is also a separate ab routine that I see myself getting a lot of use from.

Kelly has her regular modifier in Lauren to assist in showing simpler options of some of the moves.  I follow her quite a bit and like the fact that she is in nearly all of Kelly's videos.

Overall, I give this 5 stars.  I think Kelly does a fine job of instructing and has given us a fun kickboxing workout here.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy kickboxing.",1326585600,3,1263,4.186721991701245
3165822,5,B00170C15O,"This is another workout in Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series.  This circuit workout contains 2 - 30 minutes workouts, both are fun and interesting.

Each workout has 2 cycles, each cycle repeated once.  Each cycle includes athletic cardio first, then sculpting with lighter weights, shadowboxing, and lower body work mostly using heavier weights.  Most of the exercises are done for about a minute but some go a little longer than that.

Some of the cardio is higher impact, Lauren is back to demonstrate lower impact options for those who prefer, like myself.  I personally don't care for high impact so it's really nice to have another option.  I have honestly steered away from other instructors who do not have a modifier after trying to modify on my own.  Often times, it just doesn't work.  Lauren will also modify some of the more advanced weight exercises which also helps.

This DVD has tons of premixes, making a great value for the money.  Kelly has made just about every option on this DVD possible with the variety of premixes.  Some refer to her as the ""premix queen"", I have a tendency to agree!  Some are long, some short, you can just do boxing and cardio, or just sculpting, all sorts of options.  There is also a short bonus ab workout available which is easy to tack on.

I really like Kelly as an instructor, she has fast become one of my favorite instructors of all time.  I like her personality, she is friendly, encouraging, funny and works hard along with you.  She is not fake or annoying at all.  The 30 Minutes to Fitness series has something for everyone, weights, cardio, kickboxing, circuits and then some.

Another great choice from Kelly!  Give it a try!",1326585600,18,1703,4.708474576271186
3165823,5,B00170C15O,"This was my first Kelly Coffey-Meyer workout, and it was a great choice!  It is the first in her 30 Minutes to Fitness Series that has now grown to 13 workouts.  I have managed to collect 10 of them since purchasing this one about a year ago.

This DVD (along with the rest of the series) contains 2 - 30 minute workouts.  The first one work the back, legs and chest.  Back work includes reverse flies, bent over rows, and one arms rows with a twist.  Leg work includes lunge with hesitation, traditional/one legged squats, and one legged deadlifts later adding a twist.  The chest work is mainly pushups variations, pushups adding a plank hold, 3-1 count pushups, and dive bomber pushups (which Kelly calls nose-chest-hips).  Each round works back, legs and chest in that order, repeat each exercise once then an active rest, before moving on to the next round of exercises.

The second workout works the shoulders, triceps and biceps.  Biceps exercises are hammer curls with hesitation (also adds a squat), curls with extensions (palms facing out) and one arm curls.  The triceps are worked with kickbacks, one arm tricep extensions, and one arm kickbacks.  And for shoulders you will see, front/side deltoid raises, rear deltoid raises, and one arm shoulder presses.  Again each round you will work shoulders, biceps, triceps in that order, then repeat each once before moving on the active rest.

I like the active rests, you have your choice of standing abs, traditional abs (floor) or cardio (mainly low impact).  The main workout contains the standing abs, the other choices are available on the premix menu.  Some of the standing ab work uses a towel, you can do the exercises without it but since many of us have towels around the house it is beneficial to have handy.

This workout does not require a lot of equipment, just a few sets of dumbells.  Kelly recommends that beginners use 7 lbs, intermediates 10 lbs, and advanced 15 lbs.  I find that I use a few different dumbells ranging between 8-12 lbs mostly.  And a towel for the standing ab work as previously mentioned if you choose.

I really like Kelly as an instructor, she is to the point but friendly and encouraging.  She is not fake or super perky.  She is probably a little more serious in this workout than in others I have from her but not overly so.  She smiles a lot which is nice.

I have struggled with inconsistency for a number of years now, I am finally finding my consistency again with the help of these workouts.  I can usually find time for 30 minutes.  These workouts pack a lot into 30 minutes, there really is no wasted time.  And there are lots of premix options to choose from if you want something different.  You work hard but there is no dread factor at all, which is nice.  I also really appreciate the fact that she includes a modifier.  Kelly does add some creative twist or innovations to some moves, Lauren often provides a simpler modification for those who prefer it.  I follow her a lot in this and other of Kelly's workouts.  And if you don't follow Lauren for modifications, this workout is easy enough to make your own modifications.  For example, I do a 3 count chest press in place of the dive bomber pushups.  I hope to be able to do those someday, but right now I can't.

Kelly is one of my favorite instructors these days. While I don't have any of her earlier offerings, I feel she has hit a home run with this series, sometimes I feel that they have been created just for people like me.  Gone are the days of not getting a decent workout in just 30 minutes, you can!  4.5 stars for this one.",1326585600,9,3604,4.547433903576983

This has two workouts and you can choose your weight. Its not too hard, there are intervals to rest your sweaty hands, but I keep going because I am pretty strong already (maybe I should increase my weights, I guess).

This workout has more impact moves (jumping) than I like, but her modifier Lauren has great alternatives to those moves.  Some of the moves are a little advanced for me (curtsy with weights), but again I can follow Lauren until I can move up to that level.

If I have one complaint, it is a very small one, in the other dvd's Kelly will tell you, ""Four more!"".  She does not do that here so when the weights are getting heavy I am sometimes wondering, ""Are we almost done yet?""

This workout has a bit longer stretch and cool down than the other dvds I have in this series which is very nice.

What I like best about the 30 Minutes to Fitness series is Kelly's attitude.  She is encourgaing without being annoyingly perky, and she is pushes you without being a drill sergeant.

There is no fakeness, and you actually feel like she ""feels your pain.""

I love that you can choose what you would like to do for the rests (either abs or low-impact cardio). I would recommend this video to anyone who doesn't have a ton of time but who is looking for maximum benefits in the short amount of time they do have. This paired with a good cardio routine and healthy diet will definitely show results (and already has for me)!",1305676800,9,651,4.258064516129032

I used to do only cardio workouts OR strength workouts.  I never saw a need for circuit workouts that alternate cardio segments with strength and/or conditioning segments.  In the past couple of years, however, I have rethought that opinion and have found a definite place in my exercising life for these workouts.

It is with the premixes though where the true depth and quality of this DVD is found.  They have been listed in another review, so I'll just say that the variety of premixes gives a seemingly endless number of options for working out with this DVD.  My favorites are Boxing & Legs and Cardio, Boxing, & Sculpting.",1305504000,,779,4.642335766423358
3165841,5,B00170C15O,"I am VERY picky when it comes to kickboxing workouts; I've done a lot and have never seemed happy with any of them...until now! This kickboxing DVD is great! It's upbeat, and you sweat like crazy! Some of the steps are a little hard to follow (at first), but after you do them for a while, you get better at it. The instructor is great; she really pushes you. There's also a girl who ""modifies"" the routines if you want to start off a little easier than the rest of them. The ab workout is great too (yes, there's an ab workout!) because she incorporates kickboxing with abs/core, which I never thought about doing. I've noticed you really work every muscle! You have your core, and then of course you work your arms and legs. And you're constantly moving too, which makes for a great workout.

The only downside is there are only 2 workout routines, however, there are ""premixes"" that focus on only arms or only legs, which combine steps from both routines.

I would recommend this video to anyone who likes kickboxing. If you're just starting out with kickboxing, it may be a little tough at first, but once you get it (and you will!), it's so much fun! You're constantly moving too, which is what I like to see!

Update: It's been a couple weeks working out with this DVD, and I still LOVE it! I don't even care anymore that there are only 2 routines; they're both still fun! And now I've gotten even better at following along too. I would STILL recommend this DVD; it's my favorite kickboxing workout by far!!!",1304812800,3,1514,4.478260869565218

I have to say I like Kelly's no-nonsense and variety approach better.  She gives me a tough workout and does utilize plank position and pushups, but not overdoing it, and I always feel so good afterwards with sore muscles but NOT sore joints.  The premixes are great for variety.  I also have her Weights DVD and have just purchased the Circuit Burn and can't wait to try it. She is clear and concise and explains everything thoroughly.

This DVD was tough!  She gives you a series of 2-30min. workouts, each kicked my butt.

These women can lift weights!  Definetly start out with weights you can handle, and gradually increase, and if your doing the workout correctly, you won't hurt yourself, but boy will you be sore the next day.  She also includes a couple of 'rests' which keep your heartrate up, but totally tone problem areas like tummy, legs and the like-they are all done on your feet.

There is also a killer abs section which would totally chisel your midsection.

This is my first workout with this instructor --- works for me, high energy but not overly peppy/smiley, clear cues and counts.  Two backup ""dancers"" were non-annoying --- modified moves for beginners shown although you can control that mostly based on the weight you choose e.g., recommended 5-8-10 depending on level beginner, intermediate, advanced.

Two great workouts with heavy weights and some sit-up reps --- sweated buckets but was able to keep up with no problem.  There were non-weight breaks with in-place cardio moves that were perfectly timed breaks to let your hands rest (and not go numb.)  Heart rate up most of the time due to heavy enough weights and given rep speed so felt I got indirect cardio through most of workouts.

Music was more a strong beat than anything else which is exactly what I like to be able to keep in sync, do even reps on each side, and not have to watch the TV the whole time especially if you are facing down or away.

I find myself being disappointed when the 30 minutes is up...I want more because it is so fun!  Kelly is a very experienced instructor and has a pleasing personality to boot.  I like her ""get-down-to-business"" workout style.  You can tell she really cares that you get the most out of your workout.  I find her instructions very clear and I love the fact that she doesn't chitchat with the group working out with her and no one in the group tries to upstage Kelly like I have seen in so many workout DVDs.

The first few times I used it, I had to rewind certain parts to get the steps down but once I did, I had no problems following her.

I liked Kelly's kickboxing workout so much that I bought two of her other workout DVDs, ""Weights"" and ""Circuit Training,"" and I highly recommend them as well.  Kelly is now my favorite female workout instructor (Gilad is my male favorite).

If you are short on time and want a total body workout in 30-minutes, Kelly Coffey-Meyer's workout DVDs are for you.",1298764800,2,1097,4.472361809045226

3165849,5,B00170C15O,"This is one of the DVDs from fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Kickboxing offers two separate workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is around 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, Kelly also offers plenty of additional options, including a Bonus Core/Abs segment and premixes which allow you to create a longer workout by performing both workouts together, adding on the abs, etc.

Kelly works out with four background exercises, one of whom shows modifications for the higher impact moves. Although with a few exceptions (see my notes below), Kelly mostly keeps the choreography relatively basic, she also includes a 13.5 minute Tutorial that breaks down all of the combinations included in both workouts (be advised, though--even the tutorial moves fairly quickly!). The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up and each workout as separate options as well as the Bonus Core/Abs segment and the Tutorial.

Kelly begins the 3 1/2 minute Warm-up with shoulder circles, shrugs, and shuffles. She adds in knees, kicks, and squats and then introduces the four punches used in the workout (jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts). The short warm-up finishes with a quick hip flexor stretch. Without the warm-up, Workout #1 is 27 minutes long, and #2 is 24 1/2 minutes long. Both follow the format of repeating a combination for 2 minutes and then moving on (although sometimes Kelly changes it up and does a short drill-like sequence at the end of a combo). I loved that both workouts really worked the legs with A LOT of kicking; a few of the combos were virtually ALL kicks! In the first workout, I had trouble with the choreography for one combination only, which involved a hitch (jump) kick; I just couldn't seem to get to the correct side on that one. For the second workout, I thought that there was some trickier choreography during the first half, but it seemed to get more basic as the workout continued. There is a little preview of the upcoming sequence which appears for a few seconds in the bottom right-half of the screen, but to be honest, this is more of a distraction than a help. Also, I wish that Kelly had cued the combos a bit more--she's very encouraging and obviously having a great time, but there are times when a little reminder from her to ""now hook"" or ""kick left"" would've been extremely helpful. Still, I never got too frustrated with any combination given that none of them lasted longer than two minutes, and for both workouts, the time absolutely FLEW by. Each of the workouts concludes with just a minute or so of brief stretching.

The Bonus Core/Abs segment (14 minutes) is a great little addition to this workout. Since the first 4 1/2 minutes of this segment are performed standing, I found that when I added the segment on after the workout, it kept my heart rate up too! The standing portion includes side bends, punches with twists/knees, uppercuts with front crunch, and kicks with twists. Then it's on to the floor for some very different takes on the usual crunches: Kelly starts with a punching sit-up and also performs punches on a decline, twists, leg raises, crunches with leg raises, and explosive scissor sit-ups.

The Pre-Mixes on this DVD include the Knockout Mix (both workouts), 53 minutes; Punch Mix, 22 minutes; Kick Mix, 21 minutes; and Punch & Kick Mix, 22 Minutes; the Abs/Core submenu offers additional options. I would note that even though Kelly breaks down the choreography in the Tutorial, she doesn't explain how to do the punches and kicks, so I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those brand new to kickboxing. In conclusion, I'm thrilled to have this workout--I already loved kickboxing, but Kelly has made it even more fun, new, and different here. Highly recommended!",1297468800,22,3865,4.860394537177542

Circuit Burn seems to quickly be becoming another favorite.  In her brief Introduction, Kelly states that the DVD combines athletic cardio with compound moves, shadow boxing, and weight-bearing work for the legs and glutes. These moves are performed in rounds: for each of the two workouts, you will run through a set of each of the above types of exercises, and then the entire series is repeated once. I have broken down the two workouts in detail below. Kelly is working out with four background exercisers: Lauren, her usual modifier; Sam; and two new faces, Jen and Laurie. They are in a bright studio featuring big windows with curtains, and they are exercising to upbeat, motivating music.

The chapters on this DVD are as follows: Introduction--Warm-Up--Workout One--Workout Two--Abdominals--Pre-Mixes--Credits--Music On/Off. Please note that become the 3.5 minute Warm-Up is chaptered separately, you will need to select this independently of the two workouts (you are then taken back to the Main Menu). The Warm-Up consists of moves such as side steps with single and double arm raises and light impact work including jogs and jacks; the sequence is repeated once.

Workout One is 29.5 minutes long. The cardio consists of a one-footed leap front and back, then side-to-side. For the full body weights work, Kelly combines a lunge with a reach and a knee-up with shoulder work. The shadow boxing alternates four punches with four upper cuts. Finally, the lower body work involves an unweighted squat with a low curtsy and an optional jump. As noted above, the entire sequence of moves is repeated once. The second cardio segment starts with jump rope and moves into jacks and lunges back. For the weights work, Kelly uses just one heavy dumbbell for a unique compound move: she performs a side lunge with a sort-of double arm row (to one side), does a standing lat pullover in the center, and the repeats to the other side. The boxing involves two uppercuts followed by four quick jabs. Finally, Kelly calls the lower body work ""complete lunge steps,"" which are basically static lunges. Again, the sequence is repeated.

For the 3.5 minute stretch/cool-down (note that the exact same cool-down appears in both workouts), Kelly focuses mainly on holding longer stretches for the lower body muscles, including the hamstrings, hip flexors, and quads; the upper body stretches felt much more perfunctory.

Workout Two is 29 minutes long. The first cardio segment begins with a high knee jog, then moves into a knee hold to either side and finishes with a hop side-to-side. For the full-body weighted work, you will use one heavy weight to perform a unique rolling move to the front; Kelly states that this works all of the small muscles of the upper body. The boxing is especially fun in the second workout: the first series consists of four punches, then four twists and four body shots. To finish this sequence, Kelly picks up heavy weights for deadlifts and squats right/left. After repeating the first sequence, Kelly begins the second sequence with split run cardio (similar to a cross-country skier move) which ends in split jumps. Again, the boxing series is fun and upbeat: you'll do a jab-hook combo followed by a flurry and then finishing with a duck, adding in an optional jump before standing (fun if you have the energy!). The last move for this workout is an unweighted squat: Kelly stays low and pulses these while the rest of her crew comes to standing in-between reps. As mentioned above, Workout #2 concludes with the same 3.5 minute cool-down featured in the first workout.

This DVD includes several additional features. First, there is an Abdominals chapter that is just under 6 minutes. Kelly is alone here for this short but intense abs set. The moves included are quick crunch, knee crunch, leg lift on elbows, leg circles, Turkish situp (using 1 heavy dumbbell), knee drop (with the dumbbell between the knees), and bicycles, concluding with a brief stretch. Finally, for even more variety, Kelly offers a total of TEN premixes! These are listed on the Pre-Mixes menu as follows:

30 Minute Total Circuit Burn Mix (32 Min)
Combined Workouts (59 Min)
Cardio & Sculpting (32 Min)
Boxing & Legs (32 Min)
Cardio & Boxing (31 Min)
Sculpting & Legs (33 Min)
Sculpting & Boxing (32 Min)
Cardio & Legs (33 Min)
Cardio, Boxing, & Sculpting (46 Min)
Sculpting, Legs, & Boxing (45 Min)

Overall, I am extremely happy with this DVD, and I know that I will get a lot of use from it, especially with the included premixes. The workouts in Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness series, including this one, are probably most appropriate for intermediate and above exercisers--although Lauren does an excellent job at showing modifications, she modifies more for impact than for intensity. This is another winner from Kelly; highly recommended!",1296432000,51,5989,5.727784026996625
3165851,5,B00170C15O,"This is another workout from fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Bootcamp offers two separate workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is around 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, Kelly also offers plenty of additional options, including a Bonus Stretch segment and various Premixes which allow you to create a longer or shorter workout. Kelly works out with two background exercises; as usual, Lauren shows modifications for the higher impact moves. The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up, Workout 1, Workout 2, Bonus Stretch, and Premixes. The four Premixes are as follows: 1) Double Session (both workouts), 55 minutes; 2) Strength Session (strength segments only), 30 minutes; 4) Cardio Session (cardio segments only), 30 minutes; and 4) Stretch Session (warm-up & bonus stretch), 22 minutes.

Kelly begins the 3 1/2 minute warm-up with marches, jogs, shuffles, and hamstring curls. She then moves into a sequence of squats, jacks, and lunges, ending the warm-up with some push-up/plank work. Then it's on to the workouts. Without the warm-up, Workout #1 is 27 minutes long, and #2 is 26 1/2 minutes long. Both follow the format of repeating an exercise for 2 minutes and then moving on (although sometimes Kelly changes it up and does a short drill-like sequence at the end). In general, Kelly alternates weight work with cardio bursts, although some of the later use a single light dumbbell. Kelly does a great job of always telling you the amount of weight she is using while encouraging you to use the weight that is most appropriate for you.

In both workouts, the time really flies, as Kelly keeps you constantly moving. The cardio portions contain quite a bit of impact, but as mentioned above, modifications are always shown. Also, as is traditional with bootcamp workouts, both workouts have a plank portion about mid-workout. Workout #1 contains some unique weight work which Kelly likens to kettlebell swings. There are also several moves with a sports feel to them, including a basketball jump (cardio) and a shotput (weights). In Workout #2, there seemed to be quite a bit of impact in the first half, whereas the second half contained a lot of fun exercises, again derived from sports: e.g., a hitter, lacrosse, catcher cardio sequence, and my favorite, an en guarde strength move. Both workouts conclude with a very brief (<2 minutes) stretch.

For those wanting a more thorough stretch, Kelly has included a longer stretch segment that's about 19 minutes long. This section includes a mix of ballistic (bouncing) and static stretching. Kelly begins standing for some standard stretching moves, but these did not feel like they were held long enough to me. However, she then moves to the floor, where she slows down and does some longer holds; she also incorporates a towel (or strap) for some of the moves. Unfortunately, she finishes the floorwork with several moves (known as plow and shoulderstand in yoga) which I think many might find too advanced for a basic stretching program.

As with the other workouts in her 30 Minutes to Fitness series, overall, Kelly does a great job with this DVD, which provides users with plenty of workout options. Although I definitely would recommend this DVD, I do have several cautions about it:  1) it is NOT for beginners (I would suggest intermediate and above), 2) it contains quite a bit of impact, 3)the workouts themselves provide very little cool-down/stretching, and 4) even in the Stretch segment, Kelly moves through the stretches quite quickly without holding the moves very long.  I admit that bootcamp workouts aren't really my thing, and so this isn't really one of my favorite DVDs from Kelly, but most people who like Kelly will probably love this workout.",1296432000,14,3877,5.012422360248447

I am very impressed by the organization of the material on the DVD. There are so many different workouts to choose from. Kelly is very dynamic and encouraging. She is probably the most encouraging fitness instructor I have ever seen! Even from the screen of my computer she is able to engage me into exercising and most importantly finishing it. The workouts are very intense. I felt the results of the workout next day. What I love about this DVD is that workouts are 30-40 minutes and easy to do at home.

I have been wanting a HARD workout with weight training - and this one delivers! I recently purchased some Jari Love DVDs - and I really like Jari but in some ways I like Kelly even more. Her moves are simple and very straightforward, but definitely effective.

I have a lot of DVDs where I don't like the teacher and the exercises are too easy, so I started previewing them on collagevideo. I immediately liked Kelly's style and personality, and she has a VERY serious and hard-edged style that works. For my curvy body, which REALLY gets curvy if I dont't work out, I find heavy weight workouts are much more effective for me than just doing cardo.

I will be buying a lot more of her videos from now on! This one is a LOT of bang for 30 minutes!",1287964800,6,853,4.3924050632911396

These rests offer two choices, either work the core or just short bursts of cardio.  Really, the active rests are to give your muscles time to 'rest' and move onto the next ST set. The ST moves are not difficult, but all have different variations of single or compound moves. You know once you start working the core, in between ST moves, you have upped the workout challenge. Your heart will thank you. It is a great addition to my ST DVD library. Of course there is a warm-up, chatter about good body form, what muscle you are working, etc.
I am in maintenance mode, so I need to include toning in my weekly fitness routine. There is enough variations, I believe my body is getting the challenge it needs with the multiple ST sets.  My co-worker has 30 Minutes to Fitness: Muscle Definition, that is a good one too. Although I find the moves/sets are a faster pace.",1286323200,3,1017,4.398936170212766

I have been purchasing fitness videos for two decades now, and Kelly's DVD's are one of the best. This DVD is great for those that are familiar with kickboxing. If you are new, you are able to stop and rewind the DVD to master the combinations. It may take a few times to master some of the combinations, but well worth it, so don't give up. Again, as with the other two DVD's that I purchased from Kelly (muscle definition and weights), the DVD allows you to tailor your workout to your needs and time. It also shows someone doing a modified version of some of the moves if you are a beginner. I highly recommend this DVD to both seasoned kickboxers and beginners.

3165861,3,B00170C15O,"I bought this video after watching Kelly Coffey-Meyer's Step-Boxing workout DVD which is absolutely fantastic.  I love her style, no-nonsense, no hullabaloo, solid exercises performed well and coached well.  Her style seems pretty spartan-no thrills no frills- and I love that about her.  This particular video is also simple and clearly performed.  The editing leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion.  There are several options (or mixes) to customize your workout, two main workout choices (legs, chest, and back; or biceps, triceps, shoulders) coupled with different ""active rest periods"" (low-impact cardio or abdominal work).  Again, the exercises are simple and to the point.  The editing of the mixes, though, doesn't give enough time to go from lying on the floor doing ab work to standing up and holding 15 lb dumbbells for the next set, so I'm always rushing those transitions.  Also, the leg workout is not very challenging at all, though I guess you could always increase the weight and be challenged that way, still, I liked that part of the workout the least out of this DVD, and it was the part I was looking forward to the most.  Overall, though, Coffey-Meyer's great, talks you through each exercise directly, succinctly, and just exudes motivation.  I'd love to own another step-boxing DVD of hers, and I'll still check out her other stuff.",1273968000,32,1361,5.0088888888888885

To make this video a real sweat, when I have a day off, I do a 30 minute run before this video and then I can REALLY feel my workout at the end and am sweating like crazy.

While the video is great if one only has a short amount of time in their day, if you have more time to devote to fitness I would recommend doing an extra mini cardio session (10-30 minutes) before the video to get a real sweat in.",1270771200,,607,3.734375

I've been looking for something that not only challenges me physically, but that I can get more ""bang for my buck"" and get done in 30 minutes or less. This is it! The moves are challenging, Kelly is straight to the point (and not the least annoying), and I always walk away feeling like I got a GREAT workout. What I like most about this dvd are the variety of workouts you can choose from (even a full body 30 minute one!). Its a great way to change it up!

This tape is definitely among my favorites.
Kelly is a great instructor. It's clear that she enjoys the exercises herself.
She doesn't talk too much (which has annoyed me with some other tapes) and she isn't overly excited (like Denise Austin for instance).
Her attitude is fitting with kickboxing, which I like.
I love the exercises. They are fun, fast and make the time go by before you know it.
They are a bit rough to follow the first few times, but a bit of rewinding and sticking with it makes them easy to follow in no time.
The exercises aren't too advanced and also not too easy. Kind of right in between, where I like them to be.

When I first got this, it was impossible to do, but it set my goals high to get through it. I started out with 2 pound weights and all the modifications. My body got stronger immediately. I am progressing through heavier weights and using fewer modifications. My body is changing before my eyes. The ab workout is changing my stomach. I like the many different mixes avaiable to customize the workout to your available time and fitness level. I do mix it with a more moderate video I have to allow my body to rest/recover when needed.

After 45 years of neglecting self to care for others, it is very empowering to find a program that works. I now realize all the aerobics in the world will not change your body like weights will. I would definately buy it again if I could do it all over again.",1266105600,107,871,4.403726708074534

Kelly does some crazy body maneuvers with heavy weights that seem dangerous. Plus her movements are too fast, leaving you with a chance of hurting yourself if you try to keep up.  I also agree with another reviewer that Kelly and her back-up girls are scary looking...way too masculine for me to strive for that look. Kelly looks angry through most of the workout.  A smile would be nice.  At least my local library will benefit from the donation of this workout DVD while I continue to search for a safe weight workout DVD.",1265241600,20,652,4.491525423728813

Beware of the stretch segment where Kelly prefers to do ""ballistic stretching"" she states her reasons why she does it, but it is ultimately up to the viewer to choose.  She stresses that fact as well.  On her 30 minute workouts, she doesn't count reps, she counts how much time is left-which she gives 2 minutes. Required are a vareity of hand held weights.  She does well on cueing and transitions.  Always encourages modifications and low impact. I prefer workout #1 because it has less difficult movements than #2 which had some challenging steps (for me) like pivoting and movements mimicing baseball, lacrosse, and fencing.

3165871,4,B00170C15O,"I got this from Netflix to see if I could find a good workout that is better than my old FIRM upper body. For me, this won't replace that, but for others it will probably work just fine.

WORKOUT ITSELF: Kelley knows her stuff! All areas of the upper body are taken care of. Especially the back- which many newer workouts seem to neglect. Good cueing and modifications for beginners.

MUSIC: This alone almost makes me want to keep it. Upbeat, steady rhythm, makes me want to dance, is not like that ""phony"" workout music and moves match the beat. Yayy Kelley for doing such a good job- good ""real"" music makes the workout so much easier!

SET & KELLY: The set wasn an average workout set, nice but not exceptional. Kelly has sooo much enthusiasm, confidence and good attitude. She does every exercise with you and totally gives it all she has for each move.

MY PERSONAL TASTE DIFFERENCE: I really wanted to like this and 90% of it is a great workout. But, I always like for my instructors to look how I'm striving to look. Kelly and the background advanced exerciser (blonde) are just too masculine looking for me. The size of the weights, I know I can go lighter with more reps to prevent bulking. I have this thing against black tennis shoes on women- they seem so masculine and bootlike to me. I like strong, toned but still kinda feminine, with definition in the arms but not bulk. Although the Firm (old school)uses large weights in some of their moves, the majority of the instructors still were feminine and inspiring for me. I think too if kelly had her hair down (at least partially down or bangs), she looks way more feminine on the cover than in the workout. She seems no non-sense & to the point tho and probably not into the fru-fru but more about the workout- I respect her honesty and efficiency- it's just not my personal style.

I love her technique, just as good as old school FIRM. I will continue to try her other workouts (this one was my first Kelly Coffey-Meyer workout)- maybe because this one specifies weights, she goes for the more masculine look & feel. I would love to find one of her workouts I like- that music really keeps me motivated!

In conclusion, if you prefer large arm muscles- this is the workout for you. Meanwhile, I'm hoping for a pilates, callanetics, yoga workout that REALLY works arms AND back just as hard as the FIRM but lengthen & stretch the arms as well making the muscles toned & defined yet slim. If anyone knows of a workout like this I appreciate any recommendations.

UPDATE: I am still working out regularly (July 2013) and found a KCM that I love. It is called START HERE - it is for beginners and has disco-y pop, fun music and Kelly wears pink :) I have toned down my workouts since the initial review & tho while consistent, they are less intense. START HERE is perfect and I will probably stay there rather than move on to harder KCMs. I hope Kelly makes more workouts like this in the future to compliment her more intense workouts.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kelly-Coffey-Meyer-s-30-Minutes-to-Fitness-Start-Here/dp/B006R111KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30-Minutes to Fitness Start Here</a>",1256774400,5,3221,4.782374100719425

The ones I had seen in the past led me to believe I'd never be able to get past the hokey music and overly contrived rapport of the instructor. Kelley Coffey has proven me wrong. The music is minimal yet pumps, the workout varied and interesting enough that I continue to look forward to doing it repeatedly, yet its not overly complicated. I get a good sweat going and find the leg work to be particularly effective for me.

Well I was pleasantly surprised that this DVD actually is interesting and fun and it works you out.  You can start out with beginner weight (5 lbs.) and move up to immediate or advanced.  Kelly stresses that if you cannot feel it you should increase the weight because you want to exhaust your arms and if it's too easy without a lot of repatition the workout might not be as effective as it should.  I started out on the beginner level the first day but moved to the 8 lbs. weights quickly.

I really like the instructions and that they show variations of the workout and at the pace you can keep up with.  I'm using this DVD in combination with a Jillian Michaels DVD and pilates and yoga but I think this will be a staple in my exercise workout routine for a long time to come because it gets results.",1243209600,33,953,4.237569060773481

3400048,5,B00170C15O,"30 Minutes Fitness Weights is a gem for the amazing variety it manages to pack in and the fun, effective exercises. You can do the two strength workouts with three ""active rest"" options between sets - floor abs, standing abs and low impact cardio. All three are great choices, but standing abs is Kelly's forte and my favorite. There are several wonderful premixes which makes it versatile no matter what style of rotation you are following. The two 30 minute workouts and shorter premizes are wonderful for tight on time days for getting the most juice out of the time you have. You can do every exercise on the DVD through for a 70 minute workout that will get you in fabulous shape. On days when I deicde I need a quick workout and pop this in, I frequently find myself doing more than I planned by doing another little bit or even the whole thing through. Time flies.

The strength exercises themselves are classics but with a fresh twist. Very interesting to do and they can shake up routine by recruiting muscles that are not often used like the side deadlifts.

I love Kelly's music choices and her personality if high energy but in a quiet way. She isn't chatty. She just radiates energy and has a glowing smile that lights up her face. She is natural and unfussy in front of the camera. She also has the best option for modifiers in all her workouts versus other instructors I am familiar with. They are never boring, watered down, afterthought moves but as effective and fun as the ""full"" move.",1236988800,5,1504,4.546125461254612

3400050,5,B00170C15O,"This was the first workout in fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's new 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Weights offers two separate splits-style workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is approximately 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, additional options allow you to create a longer workout as well as to add in lots of variety (described below).

Kelly works out with two background exercises, one of whom shows modifications for some of the exercises. The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up, Workout 1, Workout 2, Workout Sections, and Premixes; there are also audio options for working out with music or with Kelly's voice only. In her introduction, Kelly explains that the workouts are designed for heavier lifting.  She recommends that beginners use 5 lbs., intermediate 7 lbs., and advanced 10 lbs. (note that these weight amounts are different than what is is listed on the DVD menu).  I found these amounts to be about right, as I consider myself to be high intermediate, and I used 8 lbs. through the majority of both workouts, sometimes pyramiding up to 10 lbs.

The basic 3-minute warm-up includes marches, taps with reaches, side steps, and hamstring curls.  Without the warm-up, Workout #1, which focuses on Back, Legs, & Chest, is 29.5 minutes long, and Workout #2, concentrating on Biceps, Triceps, & Shoulders, is 27 minutes long. Both workouts follow the same general format:  a single exercise consisting of 8 repetitions is performed for each of the three targeted body parts.  This round is then repeated once, and then you take an ""active rest.""  The active rests are 1-minute periods of standing ab work; these are fast-paced and hardly feel like a ""rest,"" but they're a fun break from the strength work.  Two more strength rounds and two more rest periods follow, and then there's just a few very brief stretches to finish.  Kelly moves quickly from exercise to exercise in both workouts--don't be surprised if your heart rate stays up the whole time.  As always, she adds a lot of unique twists to to the exercises, such as hesitation holds, deadlifts with a twist, and some challenging push-up/plank moves.  She also manages to sneak in additional strength work during the so-called rests (ie, one of the rests includes plies to work the legs).

The Premixes on this DVD provide a great amount of variety to the workouts.  The first four premixes feature the workouts exactly as above, with the only changes being to the active rest portions.  For the first two premixes, the active rest portions in both workouts are replaced by 2 minutes of floor abdominal work (exercises include leaning rows with lifts, knee tuck crunches, full sit-ups with arm reaches, frog-leg crunches, and side leg crunches).  For the next two premixes, the active rest portions in both workouts are replaced by low-cardio segments, including simple moves such as v-steps, knee repeaters, side-steps, hamstring pulls, toe taps, and lunges.  Each of these premixes remains about 30 minutes in length.

There are also three additional premixes as follows:
Full Body--1 rotation of each exercise (38m)
Mixed Full Body Blast--no active rests (41m)
Time-Saver Full Body Blast--2 exercises each body part w/no rests (31m)

As with the other DVDs in her 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Kelly did a great job in this video, which provides users with plenty of workout options. Overall, I give this 4 1/2 stars!",1233187200,240,3515,4.977777777777778

(I know typically you'd do the cardio first, but I found I feel stronger on my runs and walks if I do this short strength routine first) The 30 minute - all body parts, no active rest routine is my favorite. Kelly is enthusiastic but not as sacharine or peppy as some of video instructors. I was using the 15 pound weights as she recommended for advanced audiences but found I was starting to bulk up, so dropped down to the 10 pound weights. The deadlifts and squats offer a good way to both stretch and strengthen.",1230336000,38,563,4.271028037383178
3400052,4,B00170C15O,"While I like this workout, I certainly have better workouts from Kelly.  This one is good though for your abs and upper body.  There are two main workouts here and both are about 30 minutes all up.  They are tough and leave you feeling it the next day (or two) but sticking to it will definately give you results.
The first workout is for chest, back and your legs and the second one is for shoulders and biceps and triceps.  I like the music that's used here because I find it motivating.  There is also an additional ab section which is helpful and good to do.  I feel that this is lacking upper body work like flies and chest presses.  It almost seems a little incomplete, yet doing this is obviously better than not doing any work at all.
Kelly is encouraging and outgoing but not annoying.  This dvd gets it done in a short amount of time but you will certainly feel the burn and yet have fun at the same time.",1209168000,64,915,4.2485549132947975

I knew I needed to, but wasn't really enthused as I find working with weights to be time consuming and boring. There are multiple 30-minute routines on this DVD so you can change things up, and the 30 minute aspect is super appealing for those (read: me) who want to get a short cardio routine in the same day but have no desire to spend multiple hours of my life each day working out.

The most impressive thing this video did was made me really appreciate what strength training can do not just for my appearance but most noticeably my energy level. Even after only a 30-45 minute session (yes, she has a couple of longer routines included), I can literally *feel* the metabolic effects of the routine for hours after I've finished. That kind of feeling is completely non-existent with any cardio work I do, so I know the video is worthwhile and even makes me look forward to doing it (a little bit - I mean, working out is just a necessary evil to me :P).

I preordered this DVD a few months ago and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I received it today and just finished watching it. I am not unhappy with my purchase but was thrown a bit by the live format. The exercises themselves though (all cardio) were great. It was the quality of the production itself that was a bit off. The lighting was dark to me, the sound was uneven and I felt everything moved too fast. The end credits also misspelled the word cardio. Very odd.

I love Kelly's weight and boxing-based workouts, but this one seemed to be beyond my (clumsy) ability to follow, even aftrer repeated viewings of the tutorials.  Then one day about a year ago, I was flipping through my DVDs looking for some cardio to tack onto 30 minutes of my beloved Body Shop.  I pulled this DVD out and did the kicks premix only.  I was able to follow it when I wasn't worried about what my arms were supposed to be doing.  Over the course of the next several weeks, I faithfully practiced until I was able to follow both routines with little trouble.  I still find myself on the wrong leg from time to time; but these are drills that are repeated for two minutes.  We are not talking about a complicated step sequence here.  I have recently added one pound gloves and they really amp up the intensity.  My goal is to complete both routines combined before the end of the year without dropping dead.  If like me, you have shelved this DVD because of the choreography, pull it out and try again.  Try one section at a time and be patient with yourself.

3400121,4,B00170C15O,"This is one of the earlier videos in the 30 Minutes to Fitness workout series led by Kelly Coffey-Meyer.  It is a boot camp workout, where you alternate weight and cardio segments for two minutes each.  In many of her videos she sticks with the one minute format, but deviates a little bit here.

I wasn't sure I would like this workout to be honest but I do.  The weight segments are done in compound fashion mostly, where you are working upper and lower body at the same time.  In many instances I find compound movements to be clumsy and awkward, probably because I don't execute them very gracefully.  I find working one body part at a time easier, but working multiple ones together is more time efficient.  Here I found the compound segments to be done well and not overly awkward or confusing.

The cardio segments are pretty high in impact at times, but thankfully Kelly has a great modifier in Lauren and I follow her without shame.  I have never cared for high impact, running or jogging of any sort.  Frankly I would rather poke my eye out with a hot fork!  So those of us who are not high impact fans?  We can do this workout too!

I could say that this workout uses an assortment of light to moderate weights, due to the pace and compound format I could not go very heavy and that's fine.  I just treat this as a lighter weight workout.  I find some of her other workouts to be the same for me, such as Trim Down.  I used anywhere from 3 lbs to 8 lbs mostly.

As always, Kelly includes great premixes, if you want to just do weights?  Or just cardio?  Pick those premixes.  She also includes a longer stretch segment in the workout which is nice.

Seasoned Kelly fans tend to prefer her Circuit Burn workout over this one, personally I like Bootcamp better.  I like the music and find it to be more lively for some reason.

I rate this workout 4 and a half stars!",1452988800,,1876,4.312320916905444

What I most like about her videos is that it may not feel super hard during the workout, but boy do I feel it the next day! I didn't realize how much my obliques would feel the what I considered ""simple"" ab moves she has you do in between sets. Whew. Hurting. I like that, I don't want to be so sore I can't move, but I want to know I worked hard and she gives you that. I also really appreciate how she coaches you along in the video. She isn't obnoxious at all- some workout videos are so obnoxious and I can barely get through them because of the trainer. Kelly is great. I also appreciate the women in the videos- they look like normal women and not super fit women with abs of steel that I'm never going to have.

3400132,4,B00170C15O,"The music awkwardly fades out and slows down at the end of each circuit, which makes me want to taper off on the last couple of reps when, instead, I should be working the hardest to maintain good form! Then, it is awkwardly silent between circuits as Kelly provides instructions for the next circuit. The music then jarringly starts up again, often in a completely unrelated tempo. Also, the music is pretty cheesy... there is even fake cheering in one of the tracks. So... the music and music editing in this video is bad. There are ways to manipulate the tempo without stopping it altogether, as well as ways to make tempo changes feel more natural!

However, I'm not ready to give up on this one yet. The workouts consist of an interesting mix of cardio, resistance training, and shadowboxing. My favorite part of the DVD is the bonus abs segment, which I'm sure I will use often. I'm interested to see how I can combine the 10 pre-mixes into my routine.

3400136,5,B00170C15O,"I received this DVD a week ago and have been doing it everyday since. I love it! Kelly offers a traditional weight lifting workout routine which is meant to increase strength, rev up your metabolism, tighten and tone. The DVD is divided into 2 separate 30-minute very effective workouts ...
back/chest/legs on one and biceps/triceps/shoulders on another and then a separate killer abs routine. Her pace is slow enough to keep up and keep your form but she doesn't stop at all for each 30-minute segment. Even in your ""active rest"" period you are moving.
She offers some different exercises that I haven't seen before which I like. She does the workout with two women - one doing advanced moves and the other modified - which is good since there are a lot of pushups and she does them on her knees.  I consider myself an intermediate level with weights and am using 8-10 lbs. Very challenging. I feel sore but not a ""pulled a muscle"" soreness - more of a ""worked the muscles"" feeling.
I don't think anyone will tire of the DVD. If an exercise becomes too easy you can increase the weights. And the abs routine is so challenging that most people will take quite a long time to fully complete it. Something to strive for!
If you're trying to get muscular definition and  lose some stubborn fat - this is the DVD that will speed the process. Obviously diet is important too but I feel confident that this DVD plus mindful eating will get fast results.",1442620800,2,1447,4.561538461538461

She is also annoyingly repetitive as you end up doing the same 5 movements for the 30 minutes.

3400144,4,B00170C15O,"I love Kelly Coffey Meyers' workouts in general. I've tried all of her 30 Minutes to Fitness DVDs and have kept my favorites.  In general, I tend to think they are all good workouts, but not all of them are for me and my exercise style and/or fit my exercise limitations.  This DVD, however, is one that I just can't get into - and I'm not sure why.

As with the other DVDs in the series, this DVD gives the option of two 30-minute workouts along with a bonus stretch that a lot of people have raved about over the years and premixes.  In both workouts, you do a mixture of cardio, conditioning, and strength moves, often in a drill format.  You do each move for 2 minutes - although, in many cases, she'll start out with a base moves and then add variations and additional aspects throughout the 2 minutes.  Many of the moves are sports based (hitting a ball, catching a ball, shooting a ball, throwing a ball, etc.).

There is a LOT of high impact in these workouts.  But, Lauren offers a lot of modifications, ones that left me feeling like I was working out because they weren't lame or afterthoughts.  Kelly is backed up by two background exercises and Lauren is one of them.  Kelly constantly encourages you to do what's good for you - in terms of impact, weights, etc.

In writing this review, I wonder why I don't like the workout because it sounds great.  So, understand me.  I think that it's well done and I think that it will legitimately appeal to a lot of people.  I think that the workouts are just hard on my joints and I don't enjoy the bootcamp format.  And, that's a shame since my analysis is good.",1436486400,,1618,4.346666666666667

I usually do the full-body workout that does two repetitions of each of the exercises in her upper and lower body programs.  There is also a really great separate 10-minute abs workout.  I can tack it to the end of a 30 minute program, or do it separately on my ""off"" days.",1435449600,,418,4.376623376623376

3400164,5,B00170C15O,"I enjoy Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series, although I have not clicked with all the workouts.  This is one that I have kept because I enjoy it and find it motivating.  The two 30 minute workouts are separate splits-style workouts.  Usually, I prefer full-body strength workouts but I like this DVD because I find Kelly motivating in these workouts and because the premixes offer a couple of different options for a full-body workout.  It's a great use of the premix technology.

A lot of the premixes center around giving different options for active rest portions, options for different types of moves between the strength segments. The next three premixes give options for different mixes that give a full-body workout.

In these workouts, Kelly is backed up by two background exercisers; Lauren is the modifier, although she does less modifications than in some other workouts. These workouts are designed to be heavy strength workouts and I use a set of heavier weights (8-10 pounds at this point) and a set of lighter weights (5-8 pounds at this point).  Kelly recommends that beginners use 5 lbs., intermediate 7 lbs., and advanced 10 lbs. I'm coming back from a bad fitness year last year and have moved from beginner level into intermediate territory.

I really like this DVD. Kelly's instruction and cueing are good and she seems passionate about the purpose of this DVD - getting me to work out with heavy weights.  And, she succeeds at that.",1429488000,,1468,4.910931174089069

I pair this DVD with a stretching DVD because her cool down is not sufficient.  If you do about 15 minutes worth of stretches after the workout, you won't be as sore the next day.  My hubby works out with me using heavier weights, so it is perfect for both men and women.  We both feel like we get a good WOD with this DVD.",1428969600,,498,4.030612244897959

3400170,4,B00170C15O,"Last year, I lost a ton of fitness, so this year I've restarted trying to regain fitness capacity.  I started with about 15 minute workouts and have worked up to 40-45 minutes max.  In the process, I've built up my cardio capacity and strength.  I'm still not to where I want to be, but it's nice to see improvement.  At this point in time, I'm looking for workouts that engage me and encourage me to work out for longer and harder than I have been able to for a long time and it's working.

When this DVD was anounced, I was surprised at my interest because I don't have a workout machine.  But, I immediately wondered if I could use my gliding disks with this workout - doing my own thing sliding around the room while they are all on their cardio machines.  After trying both workouts on the DVD, the results are mixed.  I did each of the workouts and enjoyed them both - but I wondered if I would pull out the DVD again in the next few months to do them again.  I guess only time will tell.  I used my gliding disks and my Fitstix.  It occurred to me that I could wear light hand weights to enhance the level of effort during the cardio sections.  This conflicted feeling means that I think that the workouts are well done and worth doing - if you click with them.

Kelly leads these workouts on a bright and fairly plain set. She encourages you to use whatever machine you have and gives multiple examples: she and Sam are on treadmills; Lori uses an elliptical, and Marcus is on a spin bike. Both workouts are basically the same pattern - warm up on the machine, do a cardio interval for 1.5 minutes and then one strength move for a minute, and finally cool down on the machine.  I liked the first workout more than the second; I thought the strength moves were a bit more fun in the first. Most of the time, you need just one dumbbell, although there were a few moves that used two.  So, all you need for the workout is something for the cardio and 2 dumbbells.

Throughout the workouts, Kelly gives tips and form pointers for the different machines.  She also tells people on treadmills to follow Sam in getting on and off the treadmill because she, Kelly, gets on and off at full speed while Sam slows the treadmill down before getting off.  I'm not sure though that they always showed Sam at those times.

Overall, I liked these workouts and thought some of the strength moves were fun, especially the hot potato squat and the dumbbell throw (although I didn't let go of it).  The strength segments seemed short since they were only 1 minute, so you always seemed to be moving, either on or off the cardio machines.  For those who like to longer sets, this pattern might not be very good. The fact that I was getting on and off gliding disks made it easier to move quickly.  I was engaged throughout the workouts, but I wonder if this might be a short-term like - I might get tired of these workouts sooner rather than later.  We'll see.",1428364800,,2947,4.327868852459017

Sometimes you just need a push, you know?  Well it isn't hard to motivate myself to put this dvd on, and once it plays Kelly and the format of the workout keep me engaged.  A few hand weights and a small towel are the only pieces of equipment you need, and dialing the intensity up or down to suit your fitness level is easily accomplished with weight selection or by modifying the moves as demonstrated.  There are a few exercises that don't suit me very well, but I can easily substitute a different exercise that targets the same muscle group and still keep up with the dvd.

3400212,1,B00170C15O,"From the other reviews this sounded like a good beginner/intro DVD which taught proper form. I was very disappointed and will not be using this.  Maybe I am just too picky about form, but the ""tutorial"" section, where I went for instruction before attempting to keep up, consisted of Meyer repeatedly demonstrating the moves by just naming them and doing them. There were no details about, for example, what your core / low back / pelvis should be doing, breathing,  or even how much, if any, twist  from elbow or wrist should be present in a ""jab."" In fact, the first tutorial direction is to start in your fight stance.  However, there is no description of how your weight should be distributed, angle of feet/knees, etc. Without a proper tutorial I was not about to attempt to keep up with fast-paced routines and either hurt something or get very little benefit.  If you are someone who does not pick up nuances in form from looking at someone, and/or if you are concerned about twisting or hurting something (esp low back) I would not recommend.",1406332800,2,1050,4.684782608695652

I forgot how really good it is and appreciate it even more after trying many others.  I've been weight training for about 10 years to keep my bones strong and for me (8-10 lb. weights level) this is one of the best workout videos.  The half hour sessions go by in a flash.  Can be mixed up in many ways so never boring.  And Kelly and two back up buds are tough and cool.,1400716800,,488,3.979381443298969

I suppose resistance bands would also be fine. I would consider myself at the intermediate level and will be able to use this DVD as part of my overall routine. It's nice that it's split and not a ""full body"" workout in 30 minutes. This allows for more focus on each muscle/muscle group. You can choose different options for an active rest period, so it's possible to change the feel of the workout. Personally, I did not like the cardio active rest and will still with abs instead.

When you buy something that says beginner I think of step by step SLOW instructions and at weight you can handle.  This DVD may work fine for someone in their 20's to 50's but is not for someone older unless you've done weights before. This of course is my opinion. It moves very fast. Needless to say I will be looking for something else.,1396483200,10,486,4.21505376344086

I am an avid runner and I try to change up my routine by adding some elliptical and/or the bike training but I just felt like I hit a plateau.  I started with Cheryl's 30 minute to fitness CD.  This was great.  After a few month's I wanted to increase the intensity.  This CD was a great next phase to my workout routine.  I've been using this CD for about 3 weeks now.  I feel like my body shape is really starting to look and feel different.  I also like her Premix routines that her CD's come with.  This also provides that change up with your routine to really work your body muscles.  Cheryl also helps to keep you motivated throughout the workout.

Plus it was harder to get there and I resented the time I spent away from my son. I first bought plateau buster and since have added kickboxing and circuit burn to my collections. I love them!!! 30 minutes at home is so much more reasonable then driving to a gym or a class, I can do it when my son naps. Like all Kelly's videos, Circuit Burn is challenging, yet doable. I work up a great sweat, get my heart rate up, and feel the muscle fatigue the next day. I am 34 years old and consider myself at an intermediate level, both before and after baby. These videos are no joke, yet as I said before, they are doable, as in they are not so tough that I dread doing them. That os important. I am 34 years old, work out 5 days a week, and feel that I am in the bast shape of my life!! I am only a bit confused that so many of these reviewers refer to them as ""light"" workouts for beginners or people 40 plus.

This DVD is an excellent choice for girls like me who are 40+ and not ""athletic"" in the sense of the word. This workout is very challenging, yet Kelly does not burn you out with endless repetitions and long, drawn out sets. She has a knack of quitting or giving you a break JUST AT THE POINT WHEN YOU WANT TO QUIT! Then you are good to go again and she changes the intensity or muscle groups that you are exercising, so you don't get too fatigued. She seems to know just what to do and when to do it. She has a great way of giving cues before you go on to the next move so that you are not just standing there wondering what's going on.

Coffey-Meyer has created a series of pre-mixed routines that begin with warm-up stretches and calisthenics and accommodate beginner, intermediate, and advanced weight training programs. Her approach is engaging, no-nonsense, and wry. Because of the variety of pre-mixed work-outs (alternately targeting arms, back, abs, legs), it is unlikely the program will lose its edge or become boring. Used in combination with specific stretching routines (for example, Pilates), it makes for a well-rounded program of strength and flexibility training. I have tried other DVD programs and this is by far the most effective and enjoyable. No program works unless it is engaging enough to invite commitment and consistency.

There is only one workout per muscle group (total of 2) plus the ab workout, so if you exercise regularly like I do, you may find you need more than one DVD to keep things mixed up.

I bought this to do on a few of the ""down"" days and am very happy with the video.  Yes, the transitions are less than smooth, and the women in the video look tough, but the workout itself is just what I was looking for.  There are 2 main workouts (back/legs/chest or biceps/triceps/shoulders) and these are mixed into many variations so that there are 7 workouts overall.  Kelly Coffey-Meyer has active rests of a few variations including focusing on either cardio or the abs.  The workouts are short (not over 30 minutes for most) and feel effective.  The moves are simple.  Kelly Coffey-Meyer style is straight forward and not too peppy.  You choose your own level by how heavy the weights are.  I think the overall level is intermediate, though you can adjust the level by increasing/reducing weight used and effort put forth during the active rests.  The video is geared toward weight lifting so it's a nice change from pure cardio, and because it's mixed with active rests, I feel like I'm getting more for my time.",1372550400,4,1127,4.646464646464646

The format alternates 2 minute segments of cardio and strength.  The cardio moves are combination and are high impact, but one of the women that works out with her always demonstrates a low impact modification.  For strength, she uses a combination of weights and again does combination moves.  Kelly explains the moves very well and is encouraging without being irritating.

3400300,1,B00170C15O,"I'm not an athlete, but I am not at beginner fitness level either. I purchased this DVD several months ago. I love kickboxing and couldn't wait for the item to arrive. When it got here, I popped the DVD in, took my fighter stance and was ready to sweat. All I ended up doing was getting frustrated and confused.

My main gripe with this DVD is the complicated choreography. I was so aggravated with trying to keep up with all of the different moves that I've placed this DVD on my movie shelf where it is collecting dust. As I said before, I'm no stranger to kickboxing. I know my jabs from my under cuts! The problem lies in the fact that the instructor combines moves that are not fluid and easy to transition into. One second, your right leg is in the air and the next second she wants your left leg behind you and then just to really complicate it all, drop into a lunge.

I don't believe in giving up, so I kept trying to learn the choreography. To date, I still can't do half of the moves. Not because they are too hard, they just don't transition well and I always seem to be a step or two behind. I can pop in any of my other workout DVDs (including kickboxing DVDs) and I have no problem.

Normally, if I don't like a product, I don't post about it. What I hate, maybe others will love. But I really feel a need to warn others about this DVD. There are too many other great workout DVDs out there to waste your money on this one.",1351296000,12,1438,4.146953405017921

The woman that was leading it didn't control her weights properly she was using her body to lift them rather than using muscle control and I didn't like the exercises she used with the leg behind.  The girl in the back on the left with blondy/brown hair had much better form with all the exercises.  The disc was scratched as well, so I sent it back.

I believe the mix of workouts is accomplished by editing and splicing together pieces of the two main workouts.  I say this because there were awkward stops/starts in the video and audio throughout the mixed workouts.  I don't believe the dvd is malfunctioning.  I just think it is a poor job of splicing and editing or whatever the technology is to mix up the workouts.  I may return this item.  I bought two other Coffey dvd's and will try them out in the next few days to see if there is a similar problem before making up my mind.  Otherwise, the only annoying thing is that she tries to do her own audio instructions during the workout.

I attempted to do the workout without the ""Pre"" workout prep and I'm decently coordinated, but I couldn't follow a lot of it, and I barely broke a sweat.

She gives really good instructions to help with your form while working out.  The DVD consists of a warm-up, a 30 minute uppper body workout and a second 30 minute lower body workout.  Beginners are to start with 7lb. weights, intermediate needs 10 lb., and advance needs 15 lb. weights. You are encouraged to go heavier with the weights if you can.

My favorite workout (pre-mix) is the 41 minute full body, which I currently do with 10 lb dumbbells and will soon be moving up to 15.  I highly recommend this dvd for women who want to add strength training days to their workouts but who don't have a gym membership or just don't like going to the gym.  You can start out with smaller weights and work your way up to heavy, or you can switch from heavy to lighter depending on which muscles are being worked.

I have this and Kelly's kickboxing workout and am very pleased with the purchase.  As so many other reviewers have mentioned, Kelly is very comfortable to work out with - especially in comparison to some of the other more popular trainers.

I personally don't need a lot of talk, unless it's reminding me of correct form, queuing the next move, or counting the number of reps.

I will be honest, it did take me a few tries to get down but once you get it, lots of fun.  She does include a tutorial that goes through all the combinations slowly, which really helped me.

There are 2 - 30 minute workouts.  You generally do a combination for 2 minutes, then move on to the next one and repeat.  You see quite a variety in kicking and punching moves, but I found that all the combinations flowed nicely and none of them were too complicated once you get the hang of it.

There are a handful of premixes included on this DVD, including a kick mix and punch mix, among others.  There is also a separate ab routine that I see myself getting a lot of use from.

Kelly has her regular modifier in Lauren to assist in showing simpler options of some of the moves.  I follow her quite a bit and like the fact that she is in nearly all of Kelly's videos.

Overall, I give this 5 stars.  I think Kelly does a fine job of instructing and has given us a fun kickboxing workout here.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy kickboxing.",1326585600,3,1263,4.186721991701245
3400319,5,B00170C15O,"This is another workout in Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series.  This circuit workout contains 2 - 30 minutes workouts, both are fun and interesting.

Each workout has 2 cycles, each cycle repeated once.  Each cycle includes athletic cardio first, then sculpting with lighter weights, shadowboxing, and lower body work mostly using heavier weights.  Most of the exercises are done for about a minute but some go a little longer than that.

Some of the cardio is higher impact, Lauren is back to demonstrate lower impact options for those who prefer, like myself.  I personally don't care for high impact so it's really nice to have another option.  I have honestly steered away from other instructors who do not have a modifier after trying to modify on my own.  Often times, it just doesn't work.  Lauren will also modify some of the more advanced weight exercises which also helps.

This DVD has tons of premixes, making a great value for the money.  Kelly has made just about every option on this DVD possible with the variety of premixes.  Some refer to her as the ""premix queen"", I have a tendency to agree!  Some are long, some short, you can just do boxing and cardio, or just sculpting, all sorts of options.  There is also a short bonus ab workout available which is easy to tack on.

I really like Kelly as an instructor, she has fast become one of my favorite instructors of all time.  I like her personality, she is friendly, encouraging, funny and works hard along with you.  She is not fake or annoying at all.  The 30 Minutes to Fitness series has something for everyone, weights, cardio, kickboxing, circuits and then some.

Leg work includes lunge with hesitation, traditional/one legged squats, and one legged deadlifts later adding a twist.  The chest work is mainly pushups variations, pushups adding a plank hold, 3-1 count pushups, and dive bomber pushups (which Kelly calls nose-chest-hips).  Each round works back, legs and chest in that order, repeat each exercise once then an active rest, before moving on to the next round of exercises.

The second workout works the shoulders, triceps and biceps.  Biceps exercises are hammer curls with hesitation (also adds a squat), curls with extensions (palms facing out) and one arm curls.  The triceps are worked with kickbacks, one arm tricep extensions, and one arm kickbacks.  And for shoulders you will see, front/side deltoid raises, rear deltoid raises, and one arm shoulder presses.  Again each round you will work shoulders, biceps, triceps in that order, then repeat each once before moving on the active rest.

I like the active rests, you have your choice of standing abs, traditional abs (floor) or cardio (mainly low impact).  The main workout contains the standing abs, the other choices are available on the premix menu.  Some of the standing ab work uses a towel, you can do the exercises without it but since many of us have towels around the house it is beneficial to have handy.

This workout does not require a lot of equipment, just a few sets of dumbells.  Kelly recommends that beginners use 7 lbs, intermediates 10 lbs, and advanced 15 lbs.  I find that I use a few different dumbells ranging between 8-12 lbs mostly.  And a towel for the standing ab work as previously mentioned if you choose.

I really like Kelly as an instructor, she is to the point but friendly and encouraging.  She is not fake or super perky.  She is probably a little more serious in this workout than in others I have from her but not overly so.  She smiles a lot which is nice.

I have struggled with inconsistency for a number of years now, I am finally finding my consistency again with the help of these workouts.  I can usually find time for 30 minutes.  These workouts pack a lot into 30 minutes, there really is no wasted time.  And there are lots of premix options to choose from if you want something different.  You work hard but there is no dread factor at all, which is nice.  I also really appreciate the fact that she includes a modifier.  Kelly does add some creative twist or innovations to some moves, Lauren often provides a simpler modification for those who prefer it.  I follow her a lot in this and other of Kelly's workouts.  And if you don't follow Lauren for modifications, this workout is easy enough to make your own modifications.  For example, I do a 3 count chest press in place of the dive bomber pushups.  I hope to be able to do those someday, but right now I can't.

Kelly is one of my favorite instructors these days. While I don't have any of her earlier offerings, I feel she has hit a home run with this series, sometimes I feel that they have been created just for people like me.  Gone are the days of not getting a decent workout in just 30 minutes, you can!  4.5 stars for this one.",1326585600,9,3604,4.547433903576983
3400321,5,B00170C15O,"I really like this because it is easy to follow and i don't have to crane my neck to look at the tv while I workout. This is of major importance to me with all my DVD workouts! I get enough neck tension just during the course of my normal days!

This has two workouts and you can choose your weight. Its not too hard, there are intervals to rest your sweaty hands, but I keep going because I am pretty strong already (maybe I should increase my weights, I guess). If you are looking for a moderate challenging weight session to fit into your cardio/yoga/whatever else you do rotation - this is it!!",1325808000,,598,4.245614035087719
3400322,3,B00170C15O,"I have been using this dvd for approximately 10 months with very good success. It has a very good format for building muscles especially in the upper body. I would rate it a 4.5, however, approximately 2 months later part of the dvd label broke off. It was still readable by my dvd player, however, just last week the dvd stopped being readable as more of the label broke off.

3400323,5,B00170C15O,"This is my third  Kelly Coffey-Meyer 30 Minutes to Fitness dvd and it is as great as I expected.  (I also have Kickboxing and Weights) I like the combination of weight work alternated with cardio work.  For part of the Cardio Kelly uses some boxing moves that are very fun.

This workout has more impact moves (jumping) than I like, but her modifier Lauren has great alternatives to those moves.  Some of the moves are a little advanced for me (curtsy with weights), but again I can follow Lauren until I can move up to that level.

If I have one complaint, it is a very small one, in the other dvd's Kelly will tell you, ""Four more!"".  She does not do that here so when the weights are getting heavy I am sometimes wondering, ""Are we almost done yet?""

This workout has a bit longer stretch and cool down than the other dvds I have in this series which is very nice.

What I like best about the 30 Minutes to Fitness series is Kelly's attitude.  She is encourgaing without being annoyingly perky, and she is pushes you without being a drill sergeant.  She hits just the right note that makes you want to push through and finish the routine.",1323388800,10,1141,4.360189573459715

1. Kelly Coffey-Meyer is a great instructor.  She does the entire workout and cues well.  She also isn't annoying (not too peppy and doesn't shout or talk a lot)
2. The moves can be a bit tricky at first, but I was able to get them down about my 3rd time thru
3. The moves are fun and work your whole body
4. The music is great and goes well with the workouts
5. There are 2 main workouts and then mixes of these workouts to change things up
6. There is a bonus ab workout which is great!

Also:
1. I am very overweight and out of shape and found this dvd challenging but doable
2. I couldn't make it all the way thru the workouts the first few times, but am able to now
3. There are great modifications to the difficult parts of the workout, so this allows me to keep going
4. If you are a more advanced exerciser I think you would still find this to be a great workout DVD, especially if you don't follow the modifications and use hand weights.",1323216000,13,1116,4.040723981900452

Since this Kelly Coffey-Meyer dvd didn't have many reviews I wasn't sure if it would be very good. I'm so glad I got it! It has 2 30 minute sections that you can do together or you can just do one or the other. I only did the first 30 minute section. I was so worn out after the first section I didn't want to do the next one. There is also an ab section which is not easy. During her workout you are constantly moving. I should have worn my heart rate monitor to see how high my heart rate was. There is also a tutorial for you to watch before you start the workout so that you can learn the moves so you won't be lost during the workout. I really liked that feature and I did use it.

I have bad wrists AND make my living with my hands, so all her planks, push-ups, etc., are unnecessary, plus all the ego and fakeness in them drive me crazy.  Kelly Coffey-Meyer's videos incorporate a little bit of the planks, and yet I get a better workout and see results much faster than with the Jillian videos.  There is no fakeness, and you actually feel like she ""feels your pain.""  I have the 30 Minutes to Fitness Weights, Circuit Burn and Bootcamp and love all three, although this Circuit Burn is my favorite.  The segments are tough, but short enough that you know you can make it through.  I love the whole thing and highly recommend it!

I actually like this - each time I get better at it.  I don't like videos that have to do a couple of sets to show the routine before you get into it.  I have workout videos that have done demonstrations as many as 4 counts of 8. Skip the demonstrations and just get on with it.  We're not dummies, we'll catch on.

Many different workouts to choose from. I usually do the full body with no active rests.

I love that you can choose what you would like to do for the rests (either abs or low-impact cardio).

In the past couple of years, however, I have rethought that opinion and have found a definite place in my exercising life for these workouts.

It is with the premixes though where the true depth and quality of this DVD is found.

It's upbeat, and you sweat like crazy! Some of the steps are a little hard to follow (at first), but after you do them for a while, you get better at it. The instructor is great; she really pushes you. There's also a girl who ""modifies"" the routines if you want to start off a little easier than the rest of them. The ab workout is great too (yes, there's an ab workout!) because she incorporates kickboxing with abs/core, which I never thought about doing. I've noticed you really work every muscle! You have your core, and then of course you work your arms and legs. And you're constantly moving too, which makes for a great workout.

The only downside is there are only 2 workout routines, however, there are ""premixes"" that focus on only arms or only legs, which combine steps from both routines.

I would recommend this video to anyone who likes kickboxing. If you're just starting out with kickboxing, it may be a little tough at first, but once you get it (and you will!), it's so much fun! You're constantly moving too, which is what I like to see!

Update: It's been a couple weeks working out with this DVD, and I still LOVE it! I don't even care anymore that there are only 2 routines; they're both still fun!

She gives me a tough workout and does utilize plank position and pushups, but not overdoing it, and I always feel so good afterwards with sore muscles but NOT sore joints.

This is my first workout with this instructor --- works for me, high energy but not overly peppy/smiley, clear cues and counts.  Two backup ""dancers"" were non-annoying --- modified moves for beginners shown although you can control that mostly based on the weight you choose e.g., recommended 5-8-10 depending on level beginner, intermediate, advanced.

Two great workouts with heavy weights and some sit-up reps --- sweated buckets but was able to keep up with no problem.  There were non-weight breaks with in-place cardio moves that were perfectly timed breaks to let your hands rest (and not go numb.)  Heart rate up most of the time due to heavy enough weights and given rep speed so felt I got indirect cardio through most of workouts.

Music was more a strong beat than anything else which is exactly what I like to be able to keep in sync, do even reps on each side, and not have to watch the TV the whole time especially if you are facing down or away.

I like her ""get-down-to-business"" workout style.  You can tell she really cares that you get the most out of your workout.  I find her instructions very clear and I love the fact that she doesn't chitchat with the group working out with her and no one in the group tries to upstage Kelly like I have seen in so many workout DVDs.

The first few times I used it, I had to rewind certain parts to get the steps down but once I did, I had no problems following her.

I liked Kelly's kickboxing workout so much that I bought two of her other workout DVDs, ""Weights"" and ""Circuit Training,"" and I highly recommend them as well.  Kelly is now my favorite female workout instructor (Gilad is my male favorite).

3400346,5,B00170C15O,"This is one of the DVDs from fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Kickboxing offers two separate workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is around 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, Kelly also offers plenty of additional options, including a Bonus Core/Abs segment and premixes which allow you to create a longer workout by performing both workouts together, adding on the abs, etc.

Kelly works out with four background exercises, one of whom shows modifications for the higher impact moves. Although with a few exceptions (see my notes below), Kelly mostly keeps the choreography relatively basic, she also includes a 13.5 minute Tutorial that breaks down all of the combinations included in both workouts (be advised, though--even the tutorial moves fairly quickly!). The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up and each workout as separate options as well as the Bonus Core/Abs segment and the Tutorial.

Kelly begins the 3 1/2 minute Warm-up with shoulder circles, shrugs, and shuffles. She adds in knees, kicks, and squats and then introduces the four punches used in the workout (jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts). The short warm-up finishes with a quick hip flexor stretch. Without the warm-up, Workout #1 is 27 minutes long, and #2 is 24 1/2 minutes long. Both follow the format of repeating a combination for 2 minutes and then moving on (although sometimes Kelly changes it up and does a short drill-like sequence at the end of a combo). I loved that both workouts really worked the legs with A LOT of kicking; a few of the combos were virtually ALL kicks! In the first workout, I had trouble with the choreography for one combination only, which involved a hitch (jump) kick; I just couldn't seem to get to the correct side on that one. For the second workout, I thought that there was some trickier choreography during the first half, but it seemed to get more basic as the workout continued. There is a little preview of the upcoming sequence which appears for a few seconds in the bottom right-half of the screen, but to be honest, this is more of a distraction than a help. Also, I wish that Kelly had cued the combos a bit more--she's very encouraging and obviously having a great time, but there are times when a little reminder from her to ""now hook"" or ""kick left"" would've been extremely helpful. Still, I never got too frustrated with any combination given that none of them lasted longer than two minutes, and for both workouts, the time absolutely FLEW by. Each of the workouts concludes with just a minute or so of brief stretching.

The Bonus Core/Abs segment (14 minutes) is a great little addition to this workout. Since the first 4 1/2 minutes of this segment are performed standing, I found that when I added the segment on after the workout, it kept my heart rate up too! The standing portion includes side bends, punches with twists/knees, uppercuts with front crunch, and kicks with twists. Then it's on to the floor for some very different takes on the usual crunches: Kelly starts with a punching sit-up and also performs punches on a decline, twists, leg raises, crunches with leg raises, and explosive scissor sit-ups.

The Pre-Mixes on this DVD include the Knockout Mix (both workouts), 53 minutes; Punch Mix, 22 minutes; Kick Mix, 21 minutes; and Punch & Kick Mix, 22 Minutes; the Abs/Core submenu offers additional options. I would note that even though Kelly breaks down the choreography in the Tutorial, she doesn't explain how to do the punches and kicks, so I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those brand new to kickboxing. In conclusion, I'm thrilled to have this workout--I already loved kickboxing, but Kelly has made it even more fun, new, and different here. Highly recommended!",1297468800,22,3865,4.860394537177542

Circuit Burn seems to quickly be becoming another favorite.  In her brief Introduction, Kelly states that the DVD combines athletic cardio with compound moves, shadow boxing, and weight-bearing work for the legs and glutes. These moves are performed in rounds: for each of the two workouts, you will run through a set of each of the above types of exercises, and then the entire series is repeated once. I have broken down the two workouts in detail below. Kelly is working out with four background exercisers: Lauren, her usual modifier; Sam; and two new faces, Jen and Laurie. They are in a bright studio featuring big windows with curtains, and they are exercising to upbeat, motivating music.

The chapters on this DVD are as follows: Introduction--Warm-Up--Workout One--Workout Two--Abdominals--Pre-Mixes--Credits--Music On/Off. Please note that become the 3.5 minute Warm-Up is chaptered separately, you will need to select this independently of the two workouts (you are then taken back to the Main Menu). The Warm-Up consists of moves such as side steps with single and double arm raises and light impact work including jogs and jacks; the sequence is repeated once.

Workout One is 29.5 minutes long. The cardio consists of a one-footed leap front and back, then side-to-side. For the full body weights work, Kelly combines a lunge with a reach and a knee-up with shoulder work. The shadow boxing alternates four punches with four upper cuts. Finally, the lower body work involves an unweighted squat with a low curtsy and an optional jump. As noted above, the entire sequence of moves is repeated once. The second cardio segment starts with jump rope and moves into jacks and lunges back. For the weights work, Kelly uses just one heavy dumbbell for a unique compound move: she performs a side lunge with a sort-of double arm row (to one side), does a standing lat pullover in the center, and the repeats to the other side. The boxing involves two uppercuts followed by four quick jabs. Finally, Kelly calls the lower body work ""complete lunge steps,"" which are basically static lunges. Again, the sequence is repeated.

For the 3.5 minute stretch/cool-down (note that the exact same cool-down appears in both workouts), Kelly focuses mainly on holding longer stretches for the lower body muscles, including the hamstrings, hip flexors, and quads; the upper body stretches felt much more perfunctory.

Workout Two is 29 minutes long. The first cardio segment begins with a high knee jog, then moves into a knee hold to either side and finishes with a hop side-to-side. For the full-body weighted work, you will use one heavy weight to perform a unique rolling move to the front; Kelly states that this works all of the small muscles of the upper body. The boxing is especially fun in the second workout: the first series consists of four punches, then four twists and four body shots. To finish this sequence, Kelly picks up heavy weights for deadlifts and squats right/left. After repeating the first sequence, Kelly begins the second sequence with split run cardio (similar to a cross-country skier move) which ends in split jumps. Again, the boxing series is fun and upbeat: you'll do a jab-hook combo followed by a flurry and then finishing with a duck, adding in an optional jump before standing (fun if you have the energy!). The last move for this workout is an unweighted squat: Kelly stays low and pulses these while the rest of her crew comes to standing in-between reps. As mentioned above, Workout #2 concludes with the same 3.5 minute cool-down featured in the first workout.

This DVD includes several additional features. First, there is an Abdominals chapter that is just under 6 minutes. Kelly is alone here for this short but intense abs set. The moves included are quick crunch, knee crunch, leg lift on elbows, leg circles, Turkish situp (using 1 heavy dumbbell), knee drop (with the dumbbell between the knees), and bicycles, concluding with a brief stretch. Finally, for even more variety, Kelly offers a total of TEN premixes! These are listed on the Pre-Mixes menu as follows:

30 Minute Total Circuit Burn Mix (32 Min)
Combined Workouts (59 Min)
Cardio & Sculpting (32 Min)
Boxing & Legs (32 Min)
Cardio & Boxing (31 Min)
Sculpting & Legs (33 Min)
Sculpting & Boxing (32 Min)
Cardio & Legs (33 Min)
Cardio, Boxing, & Sculpting (46 Min)
Sculpting, Legs, & Boxing (45 Min)

Overall, I am extremely happy with this DVD, and I know that I will get a lot of use from it, especially with the included premixes. The workouts in Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness series, including this one, are probably most appropriate for intermediate and above exercisers--although Lauren does an excellent job at showing modifications, she modifies more for impact than for intensity. This is another winner from Kelly; highly recommended!",1296432000,51,5989,5.727784026996625
3400348,5,B00170C15O,"This is another workout from fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Bootcamp offers two separate workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is around 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, Kelly also offers plenty of additional options, including a Bonus Stretch segment and various Premixes which allow you to create a longer or shorter workout. Kelly works out with two background exercises; as usual, Lauren shows modifications for the higher impact moves. The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up, Workout 1, Workout 2, Bonus Stretch, and Premixes. The four Premixes are as follows: 1) Double Session (both workouts), 55 minutes; 2) Strength Session (strength segments only), 30 minutes; 4) Cardio Session (cardio segments only), 30 minutes; and 4) Stretch Session (warm-up & bonus stretch), 22 minutes.

Kelly begins the 3 1/2 minute warm-up with marches, jogs, shuffles, and hamstring curls. She then moves into a sequence of squats, jacks, and lunges, ending the warm-up with some push-up/plank work. Then it's on to the workouts. Without the warm-up, Workout #1 is 27 minutes long, and #2 is 26 1/2 minutes long. Both follow the format of repeating an exercise for 2 minutes and then moving on (although sometimes Kelly changes it up and does a short drill-like sequence at the end). In general, Kelly alternates weight work with cardio bursts, although some of the later use a single light dumbbell. Kelly does a great job of always telling you the amount of weight she is using while encouraging you to use the weight that is most appropriate for you.

In both workouts, the time really flies, as Kelly keeps you constantly moving. The cardio portions contain quite a bit of impact, but as mentioned above, modifications are always shown. Also, as is traditional with bootcamp workouts, both workouts have a plank portion about mid-workout. Workout #1 contains some unique weight work which Kelly likens to kettlebell swings. There are also several moves with a sports feel to them, including a basketball jump (cardio) and a shotput (weights). In Workout #2, there seemed to be quite a bit of impact in the first half, whereas the second half contained a lot of fun exercises, again derived from sports: e.g., a hitter, lacrosse, catcher cardio sequence, and my favorite, an en guarde strength move. Both workouts conclude with a very brief (<2 minutes) stretch.

For those wanting a more thorough stretch, Kelly has included a longer stretch segment that's about 19 minutes long. This section includes a mix of ballistic (bouncing) and static stretching. Kelly begins standing for some standard stretching moves, but these did not feel like they were held long enough to me. However, she then moves to the floor, where she slows down and does some longer holds; she also incorporates a towel (or strap) for some of the moves. Unfortunately, she finishes the floorwork with several moves (known as plow and shoulderstand in yoga) which I think many might find too advanced for a basic stretching program.

As with the other workouts in her 30 Minutes to Fitness series, overall, Kelly does a great job with this DVD, which provides users with plenty of workout options. Although I definitely would recommend this DVD, I do have several cautions about it:  1) it is NOT for beginners (I would suggest intermediate and above), 2) it contains quite a bit of impact, 3)the workouts themselves provide very little cool-down/stretching, and 4) even in the Stretch segment, Kelly moves through the stretches quite quickly without holding the moves very long.  I admit that bootcamp workouts aren't really my thing, and so this isn't really one of my favorite DVDs from Kelly, but most people who like Kelly will probably love this workout.",1296432000,14,3877,5.012422360248447
3400349,5,B00170C15O,"I was attending body sculpting classes and working with dumbbells for a year. The results are tremendous. Now, my work schedule and income changed so I can't attend my body sculpting classes any more. I decided to try this DVD, because I have read good reviews about it and I can save money. I am very impressed by the organization of the material on the DVD. There are so many different workouts to choose from. Kelly is very dynamic and encouraging. She is probably the most encouraging fitness instructor I have ever seen! Even from the screen of my computer she is able to engage me into exercising and most importantly finishing it. The workouts are very intense. I felt the results of the workout next day. What I love about this DVD is that workouts are 30-40 minutes and easy to do at home. I am working out with 8 lb dumbbells and now I am thinking about getting 10 lb for more results. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to workout with dumbbells. Also, I could be a great supplement to other fitness programs.",1291766400,11,1032,4.465608465608466

3400351,5,B00170C15O,"I recently discovered Kelly Coffey by searching for workout DVDs on amazon (never heard of her before!). I have been wanting a HARD workout with weight training - and this one delivers! I recently purchased some Jari Love DVDs - and I really like Jari but in some ways I like Kelly even more. Her moves are simple and very straightforward, but definitely effective.

I have a lot of DVDs where I don't like the teacher and the exercises are too easy, so I started previewing them on collagevideo. I immediately liked Kelly's style and personality, and she has a VERY serious and hard-edged style that works. For my curvy body, which REALLY gets curvy if I dont't work out, I find heavy weight workouts are much more effective for me than just doing cardo.

I will be buying a lot more of her videos from now on! This one is a LOT of bang for 30 minutes!",1287964800,6,853,4.3924050632911396
3400352,5,B00170C15O,"I love this DVD version of KC-M.  I love that she has Strength Training routines that are 30mins or less. I love how she has active rests in between. These rests offer two choices, either work the core or just short bursts of cardio.  Really, the active rests are to give your muscles time to 'rest' and move onto the next ST set. The ST moves are not difficult, but all have different variations of single or compound moves. You know once you start working the core, in between ST moves, you have upped the workout challenge. Your heart will thank you. It is a great addition to my ST DVD library. Of course there is a warm-up, chatter about good body form, what muscle you are working, etc.
I am in maintenance mode, so I need to include toning in my weekly fitness routine. There is enough variations, I believe my body is getting the challenge it needs with the multiple ST sets.  My co-worker has 30 Minutes to Fitness: Muscle Definition, that is a good one too. Although I find the moves/sets are a faster pace.",1286323200,3,1017,4.398936170212766

This video is a way to get introduced to weight training and get every muscle worked.  I used the 5lb weights to start and let me tell you I was sweating within the first 5-10 minutes.  I have always just done cardio workouts, so this was completely new to me.  I felt more tired after doing this 30 minute workout video than running for 30 minutes.  This was money well spent.

This DVD offers many options for tailoring the workout to your needs or the amount of time you have. It includes modified versions of some of the exercises for beginners and a choice of active rests (cardio or abs). Kelly is very motivating, but not annoying. My husband started to do the workouts with me and is very impressed with the results (first fitness DVD's he has every wanted to do with me). So, if you are a male, this DVD is appropriate for you, too. You will see results!",1279584000,,600,4.414414414414415

I have been purchasing fitness videos for two decades now, and Kelly's DVD's are one of the best. This DVD is great for those that are familiar with kickboxing. If you are new, you are able to stop and rewind the DVD to master the combinations. It may take a few times to master some of the combinations, but well worth it, so don't give up. Again, as with the other two DVD's that I purchased from Kelly (muscle definition and weights), the DVD allows you to tailor your workout to your needs and time. It also shows someone doing a modified version of some of the moves if you are a beginner. I highly recommend this DVD to both seasoned kickboxers and beginners. You won't be disappointed!",1279584000,8,870,4.310975609756097
3400358,3,B00170C15O,"I bought this video after watching Kelly Coffey-Meyer's Step-Boxing workout DVD which is absolutely fantastic.  I love her style, no-nonsense, no hullabaloo, solid exercises performed well and coached well.  Her style seems pretty spartan-no thrills no frills- and I love that about her.  This particular video is also simple and clearly performed.  The editing leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion.  There are several options (or mixes) to customize your workout, two main workout choices (legs, chest, and back; or biceps, triceps, shoulders) coupled with different ""active rest periods"" (low-impact cardio or abdominal work).  Again, the exercises are simple and to the point.  The editing of the mixes, though, doesn't give enough time to go from lying on the floor doing ab work to standing up and holding 15 lb dumbbells for the next set, so I'm always rushing those transitions.  Also, the leg workout is not very challenging at all, though I guess you could always increase the weight and be challenged that way, still, I liked that part of the workout the least out of this DVD, and it was the part I was looking forward to the most.  Overall, though, Coffey-Meyer's great, talks you through each exercise directly, succinctly, and just exudes motivation.  I'd love to own another step-boxing DVD of hers, and I'll still check out her other stuff.",1273968000,32,1361,5.0088888888888885

To make this video a real sweat, when I have a day off, I do a 30 minute run before this video and then I can REALLY feel my workout at the end and am sweating like crazy.

While the video is great if one only has a short amount of time in their day, if you have more time to devote to fitness I would recommend doing an extra mini cardio session (10-30 minutes) before the video to get a real sweat in.",1270771200,,607,3.734375

My challenge with finding a great strength video is most run 50-60 minutes long and I just don't have that time. I've been looking for something that not only challenges me physically, but that I can get more ""bang for my buck"" and get done in 30 minutes or less. This is it! The moves are challenging, Kelly is straight to the point (and not the least annoying), and I always walk away feeling like I got a GREAT workout. What I like most about this dvd are the variety of workouts you can choose from (even a full body 30 minute one!). Its a great way to change it up! Although, I must say, my personal favorite is the original workout with the ""core"" active rest (I feel this one the most the next day!).

This tape is definitely among my favorites.
Kelly is a great instructor. It's clear that she enjoys the exercises herself.
She doesn't talk too much (which has annoyed me with some other tapes) and she isn't overly excited (like Denise Austin for instance).
Her attitude is fitting with kickboxing, which I like.
I love the exercises. They are fun, fast and make the time go by before you know it.
They are a bit rough to follow the first few times, but a bit of rewinding and sticking with it makes them easy to follow in no time.
The exercises aren't too advanced and also not too easy. Kind of right in between, where I like them to be.
She uses optional weighted gloves, which I also started using. They add just that little bit of extra intensity.",1268092800,21,832,4.444444444444445

When I first got this, it was impossible to do, but it set my goals high to get through it. I started out with 2 pound weights and all the modifications. My body got stronger immediately. I am progressing through heavier weights and using fewer modifications. My body is changing before my eyes. The ab workout is changing my stomach. I like the many different mixes avaiable to customize the workout to your available time and fitness level. I do mix it with a more moderate video I have to allow my body to rest/recover when needed.

After 45 years of neglecting self to care for others, it is very empowering to find a program that works. I now realize all the aerobics in the world will not change your body like weights will. I would definately buy it again if I could do it all over again.",1266105600,107,871,4.403726708074534

Kelly does some crazy body maneuvers with heavy weights that seem dangerous. Plus her movements are too fast, leaving you with a chance of hurting yourself if you try to keep up.  I also agree with another reviewer that Kelly and her back-up girls are scary looking...way too masculine for me to strive for that look. Kelly looks angry through most of the workout.  A smile would be nice.  At least my local library will benefit from the donation of this workout DVD while I continue to search for a safe weight workout DVD.",1265241600,20,652,4.491525423728813

Beware of the stretch segment where Kelly prefers to do ""ballistic stretching"" she states her reasons why she does it, but it is ultimately up to the viewer to choose.  She stresses that fact as well.  On her 30 minute workouts, she doesn't count reps, she counts how much time is left-which she gives 2 minutes. Required are a vareity of hand held weights.  She does well on cueing and transitions.  Always encourages modifications and low impact. I prefer workout #1 because it has less difficult movements than #2 which had some challenging steps (for me) like pivoting and movements mimicing baseball, lacrosse, and fencing.

3400368,4,B00170C15O,"I got this from Netflix to see if I could find a good workout that is better than my old FIRM upper body. For me, this won't replace that, but for others it will probably work just fine.

WORKOUT ITSELF: Kelley knows her stuff! All areas of the upper body are taken care of. Especially the back- which many newer workouts seem to neglect. Good cueing and modifications for beginners.

MUSIC: This alone almost makes me want to keep it. Upbeat, steady rhythm, makes me want to dance, is not like that ""phony"" workout music and moves match the beat. Yayy Kelley for doing such a good job- good ""real"" music makes the workout so much easier!

SET & KELLY: The set wasn an average workout set, nice but not exceptional. Kelly has sooo much enthusiasm, confidence and good attitude. She does every exercise with you and totally gives it all she has for each move.

MY PERSONAL TASTE DIFFERENCE: I really wanted to like this and 90% of it is a great workout. But, I always like for my instructors to look how I'm striving to look. Kelly and the background advanced exerciser (blonde) are just too masculine looking for me. The size of the weights, I know I can go lighter with more reps to prevent bulking. I have this thing against black tennis shoes on women- they seem so masculine and bootlike to me. I like strong, toned but still kinda feminine, with definition in the arms but not bulk. Although the Firm (old school)uses large weights in some of their moves, the majority of the instructors still were feminine and inspiring for me. I think too if kelly had her hair down (at least partially down or bangs), she looks way more feminine on the cover than in the workout. She seems no non-sense & to the point tho and probably not into the fru-fru but more about the workout- I respect her honesty and efficiency- it's just not my personal style.

I love her technique, just as good as old school FIRM. I will continue to try her other workouts (this one was my first Kelly Coffey-Meyer workout)- maybe because this one specifies weights, she goes for the more masculine look & feel. I would love to find one of her workouts I like- that music really keeps me motivated!

In conclusion, if you prefer large arm muscles- this is the workout for you. Meanwhile, I'm hoping for a pilates, callanetics, yoga workout that REALLY works arms AND back just as hard as the FIRM but lengthen & stretch the arms as well making the muscles toned & defined yet slim. If anyone knows of a workout like this I appreciate any recommendations.

UPDATE: I am still working out regularly (July 2013) and found a KCM that I love. It is called START HERE - it is for beginners and has disco-y pop, fun music and Kelly wears pink :) I have toned down my workouts since the initial review & tho while consistent, they are less intense. START HERE is perfect and I will probably stay there rather than move on to harder KCMs. I hope Kelly makes more workouts like this in the future to compliment her more intense workouts.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kelly-Coffey-Meyer-s-30-Minutes-to-Fitness-Start-Here/dp/B006R111KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30-Minutes to Fitness Start Here</a>",1256774400,5,3221,4.782374100719425

Kelly stresses that if you cannot feel it you should increase the weight because you want to exhaust your arms and if it's too easy without a lot of repatition the workout might not be as effective as it should.  I started out on the beginner level the first day but moved to the 8 lbs. weights quickly.

I really like the instructions and that they show variations of the workout and at the pace you can keep up with.
