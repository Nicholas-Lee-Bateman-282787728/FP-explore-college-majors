8207465,3,B000T28PJW,This was alright but kind of slow.  The information it contained was nothing new.  Sort of what you already know from school.,1363910400,,125,4.636363636363637
8207466,4,B000T28PJW,"Still, it's good if you don't mind the highly biased perspective.  I enjoyed the history, the interviews, and the really in-depth camera-work.  Taken with a grain of salt, it does an excellent job depicting the types of work the FBI is involved in.  Remember, though, this is one History Channel session - don't expect a full-length movie, or an inordinate amount of information about the Bureau.",1359244800,,396,4.96969696969697
8207467,3,B000T28PJW,Interesting to adults. But does not keep the attention of a Senior in High School.  Seemed to drag in points in the video.,1294099200,,122,4.304347826086956
8207468,3,B000T28PJW,"As someone who is considering a career with the FBI, I found this DVD to be more inspirational than informative. The biggest warning I would give to all who are considering buying it, is that it takes place before the events of 9-11. The section of the documentary that focuses on the violent crimes unit is still relevant, and quite interesting, but all the parts that deal with terrorism will have to be seen as nothing more than a look into what it used to be like. My favorite part is where an agent describes what it was like to go undercover with the mob. He describes how life as a mobster is actually not so bad. He would wake up at 10:00 am every day, would always have a wallet full of cash, and would always have friends to hang out with. I would have had no problem in giving this DVD 5 stars had it taken place after 9-11.",1264809600,3,835,4.192546583850931
8207469,3,B000T28PJW,"This documentary is slow-moving and lacks substance.  Nevertheless, it's interesting enough to watch once.  The footage is old, with the events discussed from 1996 and prior.  It was a bit strange to not hear about 9-11 and to not see people talking on cell phones.

8207470,4,B000T28PJW,"This video series provides valuable insight into the counterterrorist operations at one of the most coveted of terrorist targets, New York City.  This video shows the diversity of FBI Special Agents, bot demographically and the variatio of job assignments.  For anyone interested in becoming an FBI Agent, or if you are curious as to what agents do, then I highly recommend this video.",1203724800,2,385,5.095238095238095
