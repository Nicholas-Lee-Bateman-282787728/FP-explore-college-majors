2616433,5,6304096720,"As other reviewers have said, it's really amazing how diligent the crew were in following the doctors, nurses, medical students, and other researchers, trying to capture as much of their activities as possible. The fact that the Zairean doctors permitted the film crew to record them in a private meeting, making a decision that they knew the international doctors would likely disagree with, is a testimony to their trust in the film crew.

Which brings me to another strength of this documentary - showing the outbreak from several different points of view, not just that of the white foreign scientists. The dedication and professionalism of the clinicians and nurses doing the hazardous, difficult work of tending to patients gets center stage, as do the efforts of healthcare workers and medical students going door-to-door and preaching in the markets to alert the local people. Even when the young students fumble, it's clear that they're trying their best to make the right decisions. The real-life climax comes when one of their own - a nurse - contracts Ebola and the doctors have to make the decision alluded to above, which may or may not save her life. How they make the call is an illustration not only of biomedical ethics, but also cultural differences.

A couple of books I'd recommend to complement this movie are ""Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC"" (Joseph McCormick and Susan Fisher-Hoch) and ""Virus Hunter"" (CJ Peters). The books cover some of the same events and the authors cross paths at those points. McCormick has had much more experience actually living and working in Africa, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later with the WHO, also joined later by his wife Fisher-Hoch. Peters, if I remember correctly, was there much more briefly and comes across as a bit of a ""rock star"". It's interesting to compare how this influences their opinions on how dangerous Ebola is, especially if you have some background as a worker in medicine or biomedical sciences yourself.

I do NOT recommend Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone"" if you want to get a good picture of Ebola - you'll just scare yourself. While the bare facts as described in the book may be accurate, the style of writing is just sensationalist and should be taken rather as entertainment, like a horror novel.",1194307200,,2293,4.889460154241645
2616434,5,6304096720,"This is truly an incredible piece of film. I teach biology at a medium-sized university and purchased this video to show as part of my immunology section. I was expecting a documentary-like video covering the history of Ebola with a few graphic scenes of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak. Instead, I was incredibly excited to discover that almost all of the film comes directly from Kikwit and was shot during the actual outbreak (i.e., when no one knew how large an outbreak it would become, and when the cameramen themselves were in grave danger). The video follows the efforts of international and Zairian doctors as they work to contain the outbreak. Unlike many similar videos, however, Ebola: The Plague Fighters does not gloss over the social aspects of the epidemic. Rather, the video also documents the upheaval and fear that Ebola causes in the Kikwit community. One particularly human scene involves student doctors who discover the body of a victim, realize they have to do something immediately to protect the community, yet have to deal with the situation even though they lack the proper equipment to safely approach the body. Overall this video provides a unique perspective into modern disease fighting. Literally every scene seems to be more interesting and compelling than the last. Some scenes are graphic, so it is probably not appropriate for young audiences. However, assuming students are warned in advance, this is an excellent video to show high school and college students. It is also a must for anyone interested in emerging viruses and epidemiology.",1185840000,36,1570,5.089147286821706
2616435,5,6304096720,"The video about the Ebola Virus is well done. The Ebola Virus kills a high percentage of its victims (77% in the 1995 outbreak).

2616438,5,6304096720,"This video is very compelling!  I show it each year in my general biology classes (10th graders)and every year several of the students want to discuss the material outside of class.  It not only has a lot of good  information about the ebola virus itself and how it affects the body,  physically, but it also shows the emotional strain put on the victim's  families, as well as the thoughts of the doctors working with the patients.  I usually show the movie ""Outbreak"" after viewing this video so  the students can see the correlation, and we follow up with a discussion of  biological warfare.  There are some scenes which are rather grotesque and  students who have weak stomachs are warned ahead of time, but the  information presented in this video is so powerful that it is one of the  students, and my, favorites.  To see just how damaging a virus, which is  thousands of times smaller than a bacteria, can be to an individual, a  region, and a country is stunning, and scary!",961545600,25,983,4.633720930232558

2616511,1,6304096720,It was OK....Only OK... It did not meet my expectations! The video's quality was very poor. Many of the persons speaking had very strong accents. The video did not have Closed Captioned so it was very hard to understand what was being said. The content was not as comprehensive as I had expected.

2616512,3,6304096720,"I saw a lot of this footage presented as a documentary in the UK in the late 90s and thought I had rediscovered it with this release but found that very different stories can be narrated the same base information. The audience for this Nova documentary has been carefully gauged and I think it does an adequate job for a senior high bio class. What I saw back in the 90s was a very different story, whether it was the alternative voice-over, the more extensive use of subtitles or the immediacy of the story in the 90s the 'original' was a riveting experience that is simply not captured in this piece. This is especially true of the tensions between the 'Internationals' who had a golden opportunity to extract as much information as possible from the outbreak and the local doctors who saw no reason to invest any time into an empirical approach when their compatriots were struck down before them.",1333238400,6,900,4.63125

2616514,4,6304096720,"NOVA has created a great film that maintains the interest of the viewer and maintains good information about EBOLA.  We recommend it for most upper level health classes and classes for students entering the medical field (especially infection preventionists).  This movie is best when paired with a lesson or activity about outbreaks and how small measures can make big differences.

2616517,3,6304096720,"This documentary never mentions ""globalization.""  However, by showing that there had been outbreaks among people in Europe and monkeys in the US, it did show that this could happen outside of Africa, though it only happened to those working with primates.  Without being preachy, the work suggests that ebola is a problem for all of humankind.

This work allayed fears as much as it tried to prove that the disease was a serious problem.  When the outbreak became noticeable, experts from around the world came to help out.  The work stated that there hadn't been an outbreak in 20 years.  One out of five people infected survived.  Unlike diseases where a response is too little, too late, it seemed like informed people and agencies took the threat very seriously, very early.

This documentary showed diverse experts who were concerned about the affected people in Africa.  Those experts were of several races, different lingual backgrounds, and both genders.  One doctored seemed to have a rainbowflag persona; another was a member of the American military.  There did come a point where Zairian physicians disagreed with non-Zairian ones.  They chose a tactic that could have caused much litigation in the US, but I guess not over there and in a time of crisis.

The camera showed one man eating a rat's head; I do think it was placed in the documentary for shock value.  Still, I was proud that none of the villagers said it was witchcraft.  None tried to ignore the problem.  People tried to change their customs quickly in order to respond effectively to this medical crisis.",1198022400,7,1583,4.894736842105263
