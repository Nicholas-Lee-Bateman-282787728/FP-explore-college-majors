8583178,4,B00CLUME24,"This is a very nice, but brief, history of the Ballet Russes. We get to see some, but not enough, of the costumes that the company used between 1909 and 1929. We get some info on the early life of Diaghilev in Russia. There are brief comments from some former dancers (not Ballet Russes dancers) and conductor Leonard Slatkin. There is an extremely short dance sequence from the Firebird in a reconstruction by the Kirov/Marinsky. The entire performance is available on DVD for those interested.  My favorite dance sequence was a short excerpt from Le Sacre in a reconstruction. I think it is the Joffrey. How I would love to get the complete ballet by the joffrey on DVD. They performed it here in 2013 for the centennial.

The production standards are high on this DVD. Picture and sound are good. This DVD makes an excellent companion to the DVD Ballet Russes. If you get both you will have a history of the the original company and its successor companies. The material on this DVD is certainly 5 stars but I can only give it 4 stars because there is so much more they could have put on this DVD.",1417996800,,1100,4.495
8583179,5,B00CLUME24,"The only problem with this wonderful documentary is that it is too short!. There has never been one such as Diaghalev in the world of ballet, and there may never be another.",1395014400,,173,4.4375
8583180,2,B00CLUME24,"The content of this presentation is wonderful.  The DVD that I have is very difficult to watch because the quality of the transfer is very poor.  I've viewed it on several different dvd players.  I looked at the national gallery site.  The copy I have matches theirs visually.  I find it hard to believe they would have released a DVD in 2013 that looked as bad as this one.  Did I get a bootleg?  Its disappointing

2 stars for the 5 star content. ) for technical quality of this.",1394236800,2,481,4.325842696629214
8583181,4,B00CLUME24,"This DVD, produced in connection with an exhibit by the National Gallery of Art and excellently narrated by Tilda Swanton, covers the history of the Ballet Russe from its earliest days to beyond the death of Diaghilev, when the choreographers who worked for him -- Fokine, Lifar, and Balanchine -- formed their own companies and reintroduced Ballet Russe material as well as their own separate works to the world.

In Russia at the turn of the century, revolution was in the air, even in dance.  While the established stars of the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg shone on stage, the younger members of the company were quietly chafing at being relegated to the chorus and having to dance in the time-old, French-influenced decorative fashion that focused on footwork and little else.  They were interested in producing a more modern way of dance that used the entire body.

Diaghilev, who loved music and ballet but had no talent to compose or perform, found that his true ability lay in being the impressario.  An absolute genius at finding dancers and choreographers who shared his vision to the world of what dance could be, he started out in Paris with a group of Mariinsky dancers, including Anna Pavlova and a very young Nijinsky, on summer break and the Ballet Russe was born.  Illustrated by clips from various ballets performed over the years by such companies as the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet, as well as some rather dark footage from the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and a clandestine recording of the rehearsal for the Ballet Russe's production of La Sylphide (Diaghilev HATED having his work filmed), this program is very good at covering the required ground -- but there was so much more to tell, and 55 minutes wasn't enough.",1392768000,,1754,4.83
8583182,5,B00CLUME24,I saw it in Washington at the National Gallery this summer-- glad to have the opportunity to add to my Diaghilev collection-- well-produced DVD-- and a welcome resource for my students.,1383955200,2,185,5.0
8583183,5,B00CLUME24,Saw the fabulous exhibit at the museum. This is the perfect accompaniment that puts all the costumes and objects on display in context. But no worries if one did not see the exhibit. This is great for all dance fans.,1382227200,6,216,4.425
8583184,4,B00CLUME24,"This was an overview of a very prolific company which was consistently on the cutting edge of its times.  On television, the costumes are more meaningful than the decors because they can be more readily appreciated on the small screen.  Had there been no Diaghilev, there'd have been no ballet worth talking about in most of Europe and all of America.  His legacy lives on in the Royal Ballet and American Ballet Theatre, as well as NYC Ballet.  What Diaghilev managed to create has never been surpassed and only, all too infrequently matched.",1381881600,7,543,4.806451612903226
8583185,5,B00CLUME24,"The DVD was produced to accompany the Washington D.C. National Gallery of Art Retrospective on Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.  The DVD is nicely done.  The focus is on Diaghilev and his contribution to the evolution of performance art in the 20th century.  His contribution cannot be ignored; his influence permeates not just dance, but music, staging, costuming and many other aspects of production.  The DVD is thoughtfully produced.  It contains many reconstructed excerpts from Ballets that the Ballets Russes originally performed.  There are many stills of the major figures, the costumes, etc.  Both sound and images are clear and clean.  Many of the Ballet excerpts are not available elsewhere on DVD; though I have found some of them on U tube.",1374537600,17,755,5.131147540983607
