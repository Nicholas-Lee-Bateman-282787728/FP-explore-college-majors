8210868,3,B000TT4SQO,"This review pertains to THE LAST KILLER.

Ramon, a peasant farmer, is suffering under the thumb of the greedy land baron Mr. Barrett.  He has been beaten and run out of town by Barrett's henchmen. Worse, he has seen his family farm burned; his elderly father killed.  On the outskirts of town, he comes across the solitary hitman known as Django, another man with no place in Barrett's town.  The two strike up a friendship, with the elder gunman teaching Ramon the ways of the gunslinger.  Eventually, will each man settle a score with Barrett ... and possibly with each other?
This modestly-plotted western by Joseph Warren/Giuseppe Vari features some nice dramatic action at the beginning and end of the film; with a long, deliberate middle section detailing the grudging friendship between the two outcasts.  Despite a simple story, the film is engaging and brisk, a solid ""programmer""-type picture.
Ramon is played by George Eastman, a tall, lanky Italian who bears more than a passing resemblance to Tomas Milian.  Ramon is a generally decent, gentle but proud peasant who resorts to violence not as a matter of course, rather, only when he is pushed to his emotional limit by cruel, evil men.  Probably safe to say that by 1967, when this film was made, the ""Tomas Milian"" type was already emerging as a western archetype, and Eastman plays to that standard.  That said, Eastman's depth of charisma and ability to channel emotions, while passable, cannot match the natural ability of Milian.  Much like every squinty-eyed loner was compared to Eastwood; every peasant turned violent would be matched against Tomas Milian.
As the gun-toting loner Django, we have Lorne Greene look-alike Anthony Ghidra.  Ghidra's Django is not the miserable black-clad outcast as is often seen; the character here is a handsome, well-kept loner with a stiff upper lip and stylish neck scarf.  The portrayal is that of a resigned, world-weary soul that would rather stroll the streets of his hometown than commit murders-for-hire.  Ghidra is good in the part.  He spouts the philosophies and axioms of the Gunfighter's Way in a sincere fashion; a lesser actor might have sounded ridiculous saying this dialogue, but Ghidra pulls it off with straight-faced charm.  (Apparently the name Django was added to the character after the fact for marquee value - in the original Italian version Ghidra's character is called Rezza.  That explains the un-Django-like mannerisms and wardrobe.)
Daniele Vargas as Barrett provides the film with its villain, and he is a good one, all smug and cowardly as greedy land barons all seem to be.  On hand as Barrett's love interest and the girl from Ramon's past is Dana Ghia as Lola, strikingly attractive and effective in her small role.
Director Giuseppe Vari, billed as Joseph Warren, keeps the slow middle section of the picture engaging despite little action.  Notable is a series of ""Karate Kid""-style training sequences in which Ramon learns to handle a gun.  During the initial ""in-town"" setup of the story, Vari utilizes a few quick zooms and cuts here and there to increase dramatic tension; at other times (the ""outskirts"" scenes) he languidly captures some nice wide vistas.  The look of these latter scenes is great, with especially bright blue skies and green trees laid bare.
The score, by Roberto Pregadio, is particularly unmemorable.  In fact, as I type, I cannot recall a single theme or musical motif.  Guess that's better than a terrible score.
The film is in public domain, and is readily available to view in full on popular video viewing sites.  As a run-of-the-mill ""programmer""-type of Eurowestern, with no real star power to boost it, THE LAST KILLER is still pretty good.  It is never boring, is ably acted and directed, and is pleasingly photographed.  7/10 stars.",1294358400,,3812,5.012698412698413

8210870,2,B000TT4SQO,"Being a huge Spaghetti Western fan and collector of almost everything released by Wild East, I blindly purchased this double feature like everything else I buy by the company (hey, how else can you see rare films like this?). Sadly to say these are two very weak spaghetti westerns starring the ever recognizable George Eastman (Luigi Montefiore).

The first film, Django the Last Killer, is a complete rip-off of Italy's own spaghetti western Day of Anger starring the late great Lee Van Cleef. Eastman plays a half-wit who is taken under the wing of a gunman (Anthony Ghidra) and the protege eventually turns on the master. Been there, done that many times before and always better. Like many die hard fans know the Django in the title is only a cash-in on the popular Franco Nero film and this is NOT a sequel.

The second film Hate Thy Neighbor follows in the first films footsteps of being extremely weak. It has a weak plot of double crossing to get gold. Director Ferdinando Bladi would go on later to make decent spaghettis like Texas, Adios but this is definitely not his finest effort. What's also strange with this film is Wild East seems to have gotten a print/negative with no opening credits so they ended up makeing their own credits for the film (?!?!). Sadly Wild East doesn't know how to make good opening credits like Anchor Bay did for Mario Bava's Kiddnapped/Rabid Dogs. The back of the box art says the film is in Full Screen but it is actually in 1:66:1 widescreen, which is almost full screen.

Am I upset I payed $20 for this release? Hell no as I am a collector of these rare Euro films. I however recommend people to buy other Wild East releases before this as this is definitely one of their weaker releases. Wild East tried to make up for the fact that they were weaker films by releases them together in a double feature but it doesn't help the fact that they not gems of the genre. On a side note I also found it strange that Wild East broke their mold for this DVD and changing the layout of the cover as compared to their other double feature releases.

Recommended Wild East releases: Day of Anger (out-of-print and hard to get a scratch free copy), Kill and Pray (out-of-print), Beyond the Law / Grand Duel, A Reason to Live A Reason to Die, Cjamango, The Forgotten Pistolero / The Unholy Four, Kill Them All and Come Back Alone, and Payment in Blood / Red Blood Yellow Gold",1243209600,7,2409,4.518348623853211
