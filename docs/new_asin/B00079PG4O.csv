8046301,5,B00079PG4O,"Most of the clips on this DVD deal with the general artistry and pagentry of the world's fair in New York, but that is not the real reason to own it. What is important here is that the first New York World's Fair existed when legendary artist Salvadore Dali was still alive and they got him to design one of the exhibitions. He created a funhouse that matched the styel of his most famous paintings. Since this is the one piece of his artwork that no longer exists, the film clips of it are very, very important and I'm glad I saw them.",1153440000,2,536,4.213592233009709
