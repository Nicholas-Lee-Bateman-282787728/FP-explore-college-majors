8557050,5,B00ARVRD0W,"I say that because the plot is based not on the similar ""Prisoner of Zenda"" plotline that we all apparently know but a novella entitled ""The Brigand"" or 'Le Brigand' written by Alexandre Dumas, pere. So it is a very romantic even sexy Spain that we encounter during the mid-Napoleonic era. Anthony Dexter (Walter Reinhold Alfred Fleischmann, a German-Scottish American with a striking resemblance to the French-Italian Rudolph Valentino and who went in real life by the alias Walter Craig) was in his second starring role here and one can tell that Columbia Pictures was trying its best to make him a star complete with 'Valentino-style' Spanish dancing and one woman in love with each character he plays. Dexter's acting is excellent in the dual role of semi-foppish (but very heterosexual) king Lorenzo and his look-a-like cousin from Morocco Carlos who goes untamed until he meets Jody Lawrance. This is the first pairing of Dexter with Lawrance, and I personally think it works better here, although Gale Robbins' Countess Flora often times has even better chemistry with both of the Dexter incarnations. Personally I tend to like the cast-aside actors like Dexter and even Anna Stein because although the public never caught on to them they nevertheless could act and often times better than the ""stars"". Anthony Dexter was a longtime stage actor, he even held a master's degree and ultimately ended up teaching high school English and Drama classes, but with his looks and non-vertically challenged-ness it seems that he was a victim of type-casting rather than any lack of talent. Check more of his work out like ""Captain Kidd and the Slave Girl"" with Eva Gabor, ""The Black Pirates"" or even ""Valentino"" opposite Eleanor Parker, most of the rest of his work really was unworthy of him though he did get a couple of small parts as Valentino-types in ""He Laughed Last"" and ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"".

Back to the ""very Dumas Spain"". The Spain depicted in the film is very different from contemporary accounts of Iberia around 1800-1810. For one thing religion plays a far less important role in ""Mandorra""  (an obvious spoof on the real life country of Andorra) than it did in real life Spain. There is only one scene (the betrothal sequence) that actually makes any reference to religion at all. There seems to be no Inquisition, no mass public whippings or processional chanting, no one wearing one of those KKK resembling costumes in Mandorra. Instead we have a rather French Spain, religion plays a back seat to romance and adventure, and the film does not suffer for it at all.

The inaccuracies of the film in period religiosity hardly mar how good it is, in fact not being accurate made the film better. It is certainly lighter than the dark ""That Lady"" (1955) with my beloved Olivia de Havilland and Gilbert Roland. It provides a wonderful escapism that is lacking in the grimy realism of modern film where even sexual acts are not private. Do we even know if Countess Flora isn't a virgin? The conclusion of who lives to the end of the picture is also more satisfying than 'Zenda', which frankly needed the two sequels Anthony Hope wrote. I'd rather like to read the Dumas story actually.",1391385600,,3202,4.871559633027523
8557051,5,B00ARVRD0W,A good period movie with good cast and good costumes.  A very good drama.  Has an old time hollywood feel.,1382745600,,106,4.25
8557052,3,B00ARVRD0W,"The disc was in a lot better shape than I thought it would be. Picture quality was good. Story has been done before ie.
Prisoner of Zenda, but it was entertaining.",1381449600,,163,4.290322580645161
8557053,4,B00ARVRD0W,"What a great print in excelent colors, the colors of the costumes playing with each other and the backgrounds and so forth. Great swashbuckling and Anthony Dexter and Anthony Quinn very convincing. A Little but: The middle section of the plot is a bit boring with too much court intrigue and too little action. Else highly recommendable. And nostalgia: I have the comic book version since childhood without seeing the actual Picture before now. Wow!",1366761600,5,449,5.0
