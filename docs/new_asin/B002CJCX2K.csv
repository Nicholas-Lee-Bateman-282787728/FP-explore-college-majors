3906106,4,B002CJCX2K,"I really enjoy these videos for 2 reasons. The first is the exercises, while designed for larger women, are also great for low back pain. I have other videos that I find myself modifying exercises from, while I can follow Debra all the way through. The second reason I enjoy these videos is Debra's encouraging tone and story. Thank you for these videos!",1330214400,3,354,4.634920634920635
3906107,5,B002CJCX2K,"I just used this workout DVD for the first time yesterday. I'm getting ready to go at it again this morning. What I liked about it was that I was able to finish it. I broke a good sweat and instead of having to sit down and rest for a few minutes or do something else while Debra and her team worked out I was able to follow along pretty well. Now mind you, at 58 yrs of age, my hips don't move as quickly and because of my 2 total knee replacements I can't do some of the knee twisting needed for some of the moves, but I was still able to get the job done. I was happy with myself that I was able to complete the exercise. I have another of Debra's DVD's and plan to break it out soon. I hope I feel as good about it as I do about this one. What is my weight? Let's say 275+.  So when Debra talks about her losing weight at 315 lbs and the struggles she went through I can relate.",1325808000,5,882,3.7934782608695654
3906108,5,B002CJCX2K,"This,by far,is the best-ever ""big girl"" exercise DVD! Not only could I keep up with the girls, but I actually finished the entire workout! Anybody can do this one. Whether you're 100 lbs. or 300 lbs. you can do this workout!(you will need some 3lb weights for the second DVD) I highly recomend this DVD!!!!",1274918400,4,306,4.581818181818182
3906109,5,B002CJCX2K,"I must say that each workout that Debra releases just gets better! I have her 3 previous DVDs and all I love dearly; Lets Get Stepping is my favorite. After doing this DVD today, I can honestly say that it's a tie now for my Favorite Debra DVD bwt this one and her Step Aerobics workout. If you are a Leslie Fan or like me, tired of Leslie and her monotonous workouts, this is a must have and a breath of fresh air for any in-home walking program! Debra has an instant hit on her hands with this one! Her laughter and interaction alone with the cast brings a smile to my face and makes me want to put more of myself into the workout. IMO this DVD is more Intermediate than Beginner and can easily be made Advanced by adding plyometrics and weights gloves/belts. The choreography starts basic and gets more ""complex"" as the DVD progresses. The complexity of the movements is still easy to catch onto and really makes the time fly! My favorite moves being the Tri-Star (not Cathe's Tri-Star) and the Wedding March. The majority of the moves are low impact but can be made high impact for more of a burn or harder workout. There is no TIFTing in this DVD or in her earlier 3. Her cast is inspiring and fun; Tonya being my personal fav as I can relate to her story which she says in Circle Time.

Being a Shapely Girl myself, a size 14, I LOVE having DVDs that I can do with other women that look like me, have been in my shoes, and know my struggles. Just because we may be ""larger"" doesn't mean we are not physically fit or can become so! Circle Time at the end of the DVD is the best yet and it really will speak to so many women. I am healthy at a 14 and I love being able to workout with Debra and DVDs that I find absolutely fun with no DREAD factor what so ever. I looked at the clock at minute 15 and before I knew it, we were onto the AB Section and final stretch! The Ab section is more about overall core work using a lot of balance and stability moves. This isn't the ""6 Pack Abs"" workout, but it is one that will promote better posture and better overall core function. Some of these moves my Physical Therapist has me doing already. The day after doing this workout, I felt my obliques every time I bent over, sneezedm or reached for an item. Pretty impressive for non-traditional ab work!

This is a fabulous DVD, better than ANY Leslie DVD IMHO. With workouts like this there is no need to do the same old and boring 4 basic steps! There is variety galore! Debra is the best and I am so happy that I made another investment with her. She's changed my life and will change yours too. Whether you're a Size 2 or 22, Debra is the perfect instructor. FYI for those beginners, if the movements are too tricky at first, as always she mentions to go back to the March and watch and practice. I love how she says ""Quitting is not an option, you can slow down, but you CANNOT quit!""",1249689600,19,2885,4.18705035971223
8364019,5,B002CJCX2K,"Dear Debra Mazda,

Thank you for being a real post-menopausal woman leading me thorough my own personal transformation.  The girl is good.  She's energetic and she seems to know just where I fell like throwing my water bottle at the screen and just having another bowl of cereal.

Are you over 50? Did you like those old Jane Fonda work-outs?  Well here is one that you can do.  And when you get good and in better shape, you can still do it.  Thank you Debra Mazda!",1481587200,2,466,4.348837209302325
8364020,5,B002CJCX2K,Great DVD set for beginners to advanced.  You can adjust your movements to get more of a work out.  The songs are great!,1441324800,,120,4.173913043478261
8364021,5,B002CJCX2K,Debra is great!  Terrific video if you're of plus size woman & want to exercise.,1424476800,,80,4.333333333333333
8364022,3,B002CJCX2K,"This is not what I expected.  I had read reviews that it was easy to follow, etc., but found it difficult to keep up with all the maneuvers.  I much prefer the Leslie Sansone walking videos.",1398038400,,190,4.25
8364023,5,B002CJCX2K,I use this workout when I'm coming out of a workout slump to get me back going.  The DVD with the weights is a great arm workout.,1382659200,,129,3.7777777777777777
8364024,1,B002CJCX2K,"I did not like this workout video at all.  I thought i would be inspiring to work out with other women of size but I was wrong.  The movements in the workout are harsh and jerky.  They are hard on your knees and shoulders.  This is definitely not low impact in my opinion.  I bought several different work out videos and this one was the only one that I did not like.  If you are looking for a good work out that is low impact and easy on your knees, back, and other joints try Leslie Sansone's Walk at Home DVDs.",1373068800,3,513,4.02970297029703
8364025,5,B002CJCX2K,"I have never been able to do a DVD workout before because I just could not mimic what they were doing. However, this one is definitely a winner. I don't believe I did every move 100% correctly (I think I may have added an extra step to the cha-cha, etc.), you're still moving and working it out. I'm a true beginner regarding DVD workouts, and I didn't find this one too difficult to mimic. There was definitely a burn, though! My first time going through the video, I was only able to complete 20 minutes of the full workout, and I've had no problem doing conventional workouts such as brisk walking.

The best part about these DVD's is the pre-mixes, in which you can select a workout catered to the time you have available and what you would like to work out. It makes it easy to get the most out of these DVD's.

Her motivating speech isn't irritating (like other users have said), it is ACTUALLY motivating. I found myself sticking with it longer than I thought I would.

I look forward to completing the entire workout and using other DVD's that I have purchased from Shapely Girl.",1357516800,3,1087,4.452261306532663
8364026,4,B002CJCX2K,I've had the dvd for over two months and this week I decided to take a break from Leslie Sansone. It was nice to see other women my size working up a sweat. But on the one which uses weights her form is not good and she swings her arms too much. It is not a problem for me since in the past I used to workout so I know good form.  But for a beginner just be carefull when using weights. Debra is normal and down to earth and she does not talk too much which is great being that I exercise at 5am. Overall I enjoyed the break for Leslie and will add this to my workout schedule.,1351296000,2,577,3.808333333333333
8364027,4,B002CJCX2K,"I've had these videos in my rotation for several months, and am still really enjoying them. I'm Debra's target audience -- a plus-size woman working to get fit, get stronger, and improve my heart health.

It is really inspiring to work out to a video featuring genuinely plus-size women. Debra herself is a size 12, and her ""shapely girl"" crew probably ranges from a size 16 to a size 22. Every one of those women completes the full workout, and seeing them do it really inspired me to challenge myself to push through even when I wanted to quit. Debra says that ""fitness comes in many sizes"" and that plus-size people can be fit and active at the size they are -- and the size and shape of her crew really backs that up!

Both videos may be too challenging for a true beginner -- but beginners, go ahead and buy the set anyway! The pre-mixes on both videos offer lots of options for length and intensity, which helps these videos ""grow"" with beginning exercisers and stay challenging. I couldn't complete either video at first; within 4 weeks of working out 4-6 days/week, however, I was able to finish the full cardio workout (and was adding the lower body toning section, which is quite nice), and was able to complete all the sets on the toning video with 2 pound weights. Now I'm mixing weights to keep myself challenged throughout -- adding 1-pound wrist weights on the cardio video, and in the toning video using 2-pound weights in the shoulder/back sections where I'm weakest, 3-pound weights in the core section, and even graduating to 5-pound weights for the biceps/triceps sets. There are also some great lower-body toning moves (all done standing), done without weights.

The toning video is a nice mix of marching-with-weights and pure cardio, so I can get some challenging low-weight/high-reps toning and still get cardio benefit. The moves in both videos are genuinely low-impact (although there are a few things, like side squats, that people with weak knees or hips may need to skip or modify) and fairly straightforward even for choreographically-challenged people.

This is not to say that my love for these videos is unconditional. Debra's cuing is so-so; she frequently doesn't explain ahead of time how the next move should be performed. The first few times I did each video, there were places where I had to stop and watch her do the next move before joining back in -- but after I got familiar with the videos, that became only a minor annoyance. A more serious problem is one I noted in my separate review of the toning video -- Debra does NOT talk about good form or joint safety, like not locking or snapping joints or how to do a knee-safe squat or lunge (or how to modify these movements if you can't do them). That's ok for experienced exercisers who already know the joint-safety fundamentals, but could be real trouble for a true beginner using these videos to get started. Beginners are strongly advised to read up on joint safety and/or get a few lessons from a well-qualified personal trainer or physical therapist.

All in all, this is a great 2-video set to be part of a rotation for beginning and beginning-intermediate exercisers, but not appropriate for first-time exercisers without complementary information about form and safety.",1346025600,2,3272,4.794326241134752
8364028,1,B002CJCX2K,Not much of any challenge. I am at a point where I need to lose some weight and this was not at all helpful.,1335139200,,108,3.5416666666666665
