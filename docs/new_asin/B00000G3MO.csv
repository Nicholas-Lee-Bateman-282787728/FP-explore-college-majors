7908870,5,B00000G3MO,"Normally, this isn't my kind of thing -- left to my own devices, I probably would never have sought out a realistic, (somewhat) contemporary film about love-gone-rotten.  I guess I only watched it because it was part of an episode of 12:01 Beyond, an awesome three-hour variety show full of obscure chunks of video detritus from the past four decades, lovingly selected by Josh Hadley (to give you an example, in the episode that I watched, Bad Love was prefaced by a 1960s theatrical bumper ad for a novelty drink called ""Green Blood,"" and followed by a 1980s ad for a porn channel descrambler box that originally aired in New York city).  And because I like to be a completionist when it comes to watching stuff like gonzo variety shows, I steeled myself to sit through something I just knew would be lame -- but the movie ended up being totally crappy-great!

Okay, the movie -- it's indie, right?  It's allowed to be a little bit rough, and it is, starting with some confusingly rapid cuts, and this roughness shows up in maybe one or two other areas.  So the production values aren't through the roof and that's the crappy part, but the characters are so captivatingly REAL; I found myself getting sucked into Bad Love even as I was unfairly jeering at it (and I soon stopped doing that).  You've got Lenny, a no-good street hustler type who gets kicked out of his brother's house after losing too many jobs; he's incoherent when he tries to express his feelings and has a problem with impulse control.  You've got Eloise, an emotionally shallow beauty who screws through waving fields of chippy boys and keeps a journal about it; her complete lack of discernment and runaway desires keep her from doing more than just barely hanging onto a matchbox apartment in Los Angeles.  It's forever a deadly mix when two self-destructives get chronically randy -- you see it in the movies, and you see it in real life, but very rarely do you get to watch that dynamic run its course with such . . . CLARITY and (in the case of film) convincing realism as in this flick!  Though Bad Love may present a simple tale with a foregone conclusion, the mimetic characters will keep you glued to the screen, and I'm including the supporting actors too, like the pawn shop uncle and that paunchy dude at The Game Doc.  A fantastic character study, that's what it is, and if had to make an argument that only a couple of quality elements could make a film worth watching, I would cite Bad Love as a prime piece of evidence!

I've got a great idea about how to bring this film into much-deserved relevance, half jokey, half not: I think that it should be made part of the standard curriculum in public schools, with a week's worth of essays and discussion following -- because watching Bad Love, any dufus (I mean your kids) can see, with crystalline clarity, what it means to live only for today, to indulge every desire immediately, to perpetually make excuses without ever trying to amend one's behavior beyond the most superficial tweak, and ABOVE ALL:  what it really means to dump all your longing for meaning into fly-by-night infatuations, and this works for things as well as for people.  It may sound absurd to suggest, but what are kids really learning from the all-inclusive feel-good malarkey the teachers vomit on them in public school?  Little Johnny is just going to grow up to be a bum who shoots dope behind the mom and pop gas station, and little Sally is going to become a prostitute who violently robs old people for their medicine no matter how many warm fuzzies you pour on them!  Wouldn't it be more beneficial to paint an accurate picture of where they are probably going if they don't do some soul searching?  The time for change is now!

This underrated film has moral, as well as entertainment, value by simply being honest about human nature, and I'm not kidding!",1485648000,,3876,4.61863173216885
7908871,3,B00000G3MO,"I bought this video because I wanted to see Tom Sizemore in a starring role (apart from the ""Relic""). Though both stars are known for their abilities, they seemed like guests in the film. Awkward acting, and poor directing. The ending is very good, at least we have some reactions from the cast, bun in conclusion, I wouldn't judge TS by this movie. He is a lot more than he seems to be in this one. Definitely recommended for his fans, truly handsome and with lots of sensual scenes.",1024531200,3,484,4.449438202247191
7908872,3,B00000G3MO,"Pamela Gidley plays Eloise, a down and out chick who is looking for a job, can't keep a boyfriend, has a crappy apartment and has really bad luck.  Tom Sizemore plays Lenny, a sweet but annoying guy who can't get a decent job w/out screwing it up.  When they meet it, they fall for each other and start a hot-and-heavy, ill-fated romance.  After going through a LOT of trouble, Lenny thinks of a plan to make some money...but of course things don't go as planned.  Its nice to see Tom Sizemore (Heat, Saving Private Ryan, True Romance, Natural Born Killers) get a lot of screen time and play just a regular guy instead of his usual roles ~ He is a wonderful and underated actor who played the part of Lenny well.  I don't know much about model/actress Pamela Gidley, but she pulled her role off well also.  She has a certain spunk and charisma that works for her.  Although the acting wasn't ""Academy Award"" winning, it has poor direction, a semi~bad script, and its cheaply made ~ its a good movie to watch late night when your flipping through channels.  Die hard Tom Sizemore fans will love it, although it may dissapoint your average movie buff (the sex and nudity seems to subsitute for a good script) Watch out for a small role played by Debi Mazar & Margaux Hemingway!",985824000,6,1275,4.489177489177489
