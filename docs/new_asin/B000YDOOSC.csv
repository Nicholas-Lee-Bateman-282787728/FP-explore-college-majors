8232337,1,B000YDOOSC,"I have no idea why Amazon is selling this dvd. this is a bootleg copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Story-of-Killing-Pablo/dp/B0021SGOAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Story of Killing Pablo</a>. The dvd comes in a cheap dvd case (says blockbuster video on the inside of the case) with a dvd cover that looks like it was printed from a home printer. The art on the dvd also looks amatuer job. The title of the dvd says king of coke but as soon as the dvd starts to play the title says ""True Story of Killing Pablo"" and it is hosted by author Mark Bowden. There is no menu screen, no chapter select nothing at all the dvd just starts to play. The quality of the dvd is very poor it looks like it was recorded from a capture card and the interlacing is very bad the images are very grainy. I have no Idea why the other reviewers gave it such a high rating. Do yourself a favor and buy the real thing.",1306022400,6,952,4.740963855421687
8232338,4,B000YDOOSC,"Great information from one side, what about the other side? We will never know. As like the others said, horrible quality for DVD content. No chapters, just straight into it.",1256601600,,174,4.833333333333333
8232339,5,B000YDOOSC,dvd could of been put together a little better .. but none the less its to the point and shares a good documentry of the king of coke!,1242432000,2,134,3.8214285714285716
8232340,5,B000YDOOSC,"this was outstanding, love the dvd, and please get it, you will enjoy and fast delivery...indeed...this is truly a great dvd to watch....",1227571200,,137,5.0
8232341,3,B000YDOOSC,"I'll get right to the point. This DVD would be up there with Cocaine Cowboys 1-2, Mr. Untouchable, and other informative documentaries but it's mega-cheap and definitely not worth the price. It looks like something I could have bought in an alley behind a fried chicken shack for five bucks or less. There's no menu or chapters. It just begins abruptly and ends the same way. It feels like it was recorded from a cable tv show. On the other hand, I was shocked, amazed, and thrilled by Pablo's rise and fall. I just wish I would have bought my copy on the street.",1226966400,3,563,4.423076923076923
8232342,3,B000YDOOSC,"This work shows the rise and fall of the biggest cocaine's trafficker.  Sensitive viewers should not watch this as it shows myriad shot and mangled corpses.  Escobar killed 3 Colombian presidential candidates, 11 of the country's 21 justices, and thousands more.  These facts are Machiavellian:  the more crimes he committed, the more people and groups were willing to fight him no matter what.  The work ends with comparisons of Escobar to bin Laden.  For years, I have heard that Colombia is a very violent and troubled country.  This work touches upon why that is.

This has diverse interviewees: American and Colombian nationals, native English speakers, those using English as a second language, and those whose Spanish must be translated.  I do think all the interviewees were male, however.  This work interviews  many important people, including ambassadors, presidents, vice-presidents, and DEA agents.

I was told that this work was 60 minutes, but it's actually 90.  Now maybe I didn't see a high-quality copy, but this sure didn't seem to have chapters.  So don't think you can skip around without doing a lot of fast-forwarding.",1217980800,11,1141,5.163934426229508
