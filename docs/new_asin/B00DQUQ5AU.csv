All in all an enbarrasment .",1393891200,,143,4.296296296296297

8596469,1,B00DQUQ5AU,"Yep this movie is pretty stinky.  I don't see why so many like it.  I worked about a week on the film.  I played one of the henchmen for the bad guy in the park.  I am the one in the tree.  I was also in the bakery scene  and in the dream squences, but it seems the scenes I did in the dream section were cut out. Plus i don't see myself in the cake scene, though I know I was there when they filmed it.  Plus some of the other stuff we did in the park.  A number of the other gags in the park were cut.  Plus the whole walking up and confronting Pataki in the park was cut.  There was a scene with the bad guy walking up to Pataki with his henchmen and that whole part is not in it.  The park sequence was filmed up near Dodger stadium.  I didn't get paid for this,  we were all told the money ran out. Even Pataki didn't get paid and it stuck in his craw afterwards.  I heard him bitch many a time about it.  I thought this film died and was never going to see the light of day. BTW, an interesting side note.  The cute blond guy in the party at the bakery , the scene with the cake.  This blond guy was Pataki's current  live in boyfriend.  I hung out with him often at Pataki's house.",1377043200,2,1188,3.814814814814815
8596470,4,B00DQUQ5AU,"This is an unusual but very funny show...Not many people are aware of this true to life phenomenon that existed in the vaudeville era,pre-dating Howard Stern's FARTMAN character by many decades. If this kind of silly humor sounds like it's  right UP YOUR A..lley, then take the plunge(r)and get it! So... grab some air freshener (in case you choose to spontaneously participate) and get ready for the fireworks!",1376352000,,411,5.044117647058823
8596471,5,B00DQUQ5AU,"Back in the day when VHS was battling Beta for market dominance I first saw this movie.  It was delightfully funny back then.  One could not help notice that the cast was having as much fun making the movie as the viewer was watching it.  An unusual topic (flatulence taken to high art) combined with an atypical location (purgatory) combine to make great comedy.  It is hard to tell if it was all scripted or partially improvised, but, it comes together in one hysterically funny whole.

A friend knew of my proclivity for this film and gave me the gift of this DVD.  I was thrilled because, you know what; it is still just as funny now as it was yesterday.",1375315200,,658,4.396694214876033
8596472,5,B00DQUQ5AU,"One of the funniest silliest movies I've seen all year is The Fartiste. It's a great cult film from 1987 that just got released on dvd. Michael Pataki is excellent and all the supporting actors are great too. Based on a true story about a turn of the century performer who entertained audiences with his flatulence, this film had me laughing from start to finish.  Crack open the brews,  smoke 'em if you got 'em and sit back and watch the funniest film about farting there is !! Don't be surprised if you start joining in with your own ""sound effects"" before the movie's over. Fun for the hole family !!!!!!!!!",1375228800,,611,4.495495495495495
8596473,4,B00DQUQ5AU,"You won't find this on any of the principals' imdb filmographies, but this little comic relic provides lots of laughs if viewed with a forgiving eye to its low budget (it looks like it was mastered on VHS) and low humor aspirations. The late character actor Michael Pataki plays Le Petomane, aka The Fartiste, an actual vaudeville artist whose act was just what you think it was. Much of the video is set in Purgatory as our deceased hero tries to come to grips with his odd talent. Comedy nerds will spot lots of familiar comics, most of whom were just a bit past their primes when this was shot in 1987: Sandy Baron, Jackie Gayle, Shecky Greene, Jackie Vernon and best of all, Eileen Brennan, who alone among the cast understands the value of underplaying and gets laughs with the twitch of the lips or a lift of an eyebrow. This was also known as A Blast From the Past, which is just what will be had if approached with the right attitude.",1374969600,,942,4.419540229885057
8596474,5,B00DQUQ5AU,"I remember seeing a foregin version of Le Petomane at a Film Fest. several years ago; it was quite boring. So I was somewhat skeptical about viewing anything else about this subject. Well this movie is not only clevery written and very funny, but has a classic cast. And you know the film was ahead of its time just by this extensive cast of actors, who at the time chose to be part of it. Most every character is someone who you will recognize from other films, and just seeing them having fun and enjoying themselves is what make this film so surprisingly funny for a subject that has been beaten to death in films today. No deep message, just an  hour of laughs and entertainment! I won't attempt to list my favorite actors and their scenes, as I would definitely exceed the 300 words allowed here.",1374969600,,801,4.448979591836735
8596475,5,B00DQUQ5AU,"Michael Pataki's side ( and rear ) splitting performances may not be for the mainstream, but stands up to any SNL skit ever performed !
 I didn't know anything about the fartiste before viewing , and now I'm hooked and can't wait to see it again.
 The gambling dart board scene stand up as one of the top comedy bits ever !  You will get your eight dollar's worth for sure !",1374624000,,374,4.166666666666667
