8131642,2,B000GG4Y0A,"I expected an overview and history of this ritual. Instead one sees an endless parade of naked, elderly men being soaped, massaged and eating. The quality of the film resembles a home video, i.e., grainy, black and white and with a soundtrack (no captions/subtitles) so poor that it is hardly possible to understand what's being said, especially by European men with noticeable accents. All in all, a disappointment and hardly worth watching.",1465257600,,442,5.152777777777778

8131645,3,B000GG4Y0A,"This film brings me back to a lost time in the distant past. It brought back memories of uncles, friend of the family and a one tim trip with my late father. I thoroughly enjoyed the film",1380672000,,187,4.081081081081081
8131646,5,B000GG4Y0A,"This documentary of the Coney Island steam baths is absolutely heart warming.  It captures a rare ritual of true community that is all but lost to us today.  Would be of special interest to the Jewish community, but its humanity speaks to all people.

The other two films on the DVD are thought provoking and meaningful essays on the emergence of suburbia in America - and may be of special interest to people who are familiar with or had family in New York and New Jersey in the early 1900s.  I was stunned to see a clip of the old real estate office in Cliffwood Beach, NJ that looked like a ship.  It's fleeting, but there it is!",1223078400,2,632,4.322033898305085
