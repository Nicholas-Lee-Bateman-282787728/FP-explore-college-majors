4713712,2,B005JZBOV0,"I'm really disappointed in the quality of this DVD -- NOT in Meryl Streep. First, because there's no way to choose which of the movies you watch. The first one's first and that's it. Second, there's no closed captioning. My mother needs it, so I can't watch it with her. And she's always near the TV. Makes me wonder if it's pirated.",1362182400,28,333,4.387096774193548
4713713,5,B005JZBOV0,"I just finished watching all three of these wonderful movies and loved them all. MUSIC OF THE HEART WAS the movie I thought I would like the least. I did not think a movie about a bunch of inner-city elementary kids learning to play a violin would hold my interest. I was so wrong! This movie tugged at my heart strings. Before watching this movie I never listened to violin music. MUSIC OF THE HEART gave me an appreciation for this instrument the violin and the beautiful music it produces. MERYL STREEP was amazing in the role of Roberta Guaspari fighting to teach violin to students in a rough inner-city. However, it was the children who were the real stars of this movie. I highly recommend this movie to be watched with a box of tissues. MUSIC OF THE HEART TWO THUMBS UP. :)",1360195200,14,781,4.430555555555555
4713714,5,B005JZBOV0,What is there to say? Has Meryl Streep ever made a bad or even a mediocre movie?  I think not.,1356825600,2,94,3.7
4713715,5,B005JZBOV0,"You really can't beat this disc.  All 3 movies that are included in this are great.  It's one disc.  One side contains ""Music of the Heart"" and ""Marvin's Room"".  The other side contains ""House of the Spirits"".  Because the transfer is compressed there are no special bonus features or close captioning etc.  It's just the movies.  I loved this and found it at  Target for $5.  That's less than $2 for each movie!  You can't beat that.  Meryl Streep is one of the most incredible actresses out there and she's different in every one of these films.  She disappears into each of the characters.  Sometimes you buy a double or quadruple feature disc where only 1 or 2 of the movies are good, not with this, these are all good!  Great buy.  They should do this with some of the big actors getting some good gems on one disc like this, not their crappy movies when they were starting out.",1329609600,73,883,4.43125

4713718,5,B005JZBOV0,"Music of the Heart is outstanding and the DVD is worth it just for that movie alone. The House of the Spirits was interesting (a bit strange) but moving. I have not been able to watch the third film yet because of a quirk in my DVD player, as I have no remote for it. I am delighted with the DVD and highly recommend it. I will watch Marvin's Room on my computer when I get the chance. This is a wonderful value and contains very worthwhile films.",1425513600,,447,4.090909090909091

4713722,5,B005JZBOV0,"Couldn't finish The House of the Spirits because I couldn't stand the character, Esteban.  I'm not into stories where the heroine marries a Mr. Rochester type - tall, gloomy, and handsome with a dark stain upon his soul. The other two movies, Music of the Heart and Marvin's Room were excellent.",1418688000,,295,4.784313725490196

4713739,5,B005JZBOV0,"Meryl Streep was a freshman in my college dorm when I was a junior.  As it happened, I fixed her up with the young man she ended up dating for several years.  As a consequence, I have always taken a great interest in her career.  What struck me most was her performance in a play called ""Uncommon Women and Others"" which was about students in a women's college and was broadcast on PBS.  As that was the context in which I knew her, it is a tribute to her acting skills that I quickly forgot the young woman in my dorm and believed wholly in the quite different character she was playing.  She is truly one of the greatest actresses of her generation.",1398643200,2,651,4.260162601626016
4713740,4,B005JZBOV0,The three movies in the set are completely different from each other.  My favorite is Music of the Heart. The House of the Spirits is kind of an epic taking place in Argentina that has its moments.  The set is worth having although I found that Marvin's Room did not keep my interest.,1398297600,,284,4.339622641509434

4713749,2,B005JZBOV0,"Did not like having all three movies on one disk, would prefer separate disks for each.  The movies were o.k. but not sensational.  The one about the generational family was difficult to follow in the beginning, and was not interesting to me.....did not even finish watching it, because I could not like any of the characters.....bad conduct in characters can gain my interest and sympathy, but not any of these in this movie.  Did like the music of the violin teacher story,, the only one that I could appreciate.",1388707200,,514,4.752808988764045

I enjoyed two of the three, though I feel I must see the one I didn't enjoy so much was because I didn't get the message behind the film.
