2073261,5,B0002ABU5C,"Unlike some reviews that are allowed here, I actually own this set of DVD's and have watched all of it.

Those of us who are die hard R&B fans wondered if we'd see more after the release of Season 1.  Happily, our concerns are unfounded with the release of Season 2. The restoration treatment is as good as the first set. Some fans did not like the ""watermark"" of ""R&B"" in the corner on the first edition.  I don't like that trend either but, at least here, it is transparent and only visable for a few seconds.

This set includes four double-sided discs with 52 shows, that include 36 episodes of ""Upsidasium"", 16 episodes of ""Metal Munching Mice"", 12 episodes of ""Greenpernt Oogle"", 8 episodes of ""Rue Brittania"", 14 episodes of ""Buried Treasure"" and 14 episodes of ""Wailing Whale"".

You also get 35 Fractured Fairy Tales; 34 Mr. Peabody's; 17 Aesop and Son's and 18 Dudley Do-Right's.

""Mr. Know-It-All"" and ""Bullwinle's Corner"" are in plentiful supply as well.

Extras include ""Classic TV Commercials"" (3 Cheerios commercials that featured Bullwinkle); ""June Foray Interview"" (the voice behind many cartoon characters including Rocky's - from Sept. 2003); ""Sneak Peak at Complete Season 3"" (yes, the ""Dirwood Kirby episode!); and ""Moosecalls - The Best of Bullwinkle Sings"" (a montage of R&B clips edited with voice-overs and graphics to spoof a TV record album pitch - which looks like it was put-together for this DVD set).

While I was pleased to see the content expanded, I was disapointed in the packaging.  In a word - CHEAP. Sony Wonder should be ashamed of itself for releasing such a collector's item in a cheesy package. I returned two copies before I got one with un-broken plastic DVD holders! It also would have been more thoughtful if the double-sided discs were ordered, so that those of us with multi-disc changers could watch all the Side A's and then flip the discs to watch all of the Side B's. If you want to watch this set in order, you'll have to flip each disc after watching Side A.

The opening and ending titles for each ""show"" are modified to read ""Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends"", as was the first season release.  It would be nice if one of the remaining sets had the original graphics/titles included (Ponsoby Britt where are you?).

Watching these classics again reminds us of why these were the first cartoons to appeal to adults and children alike. So stop reading this and buy it already!",1093996800,146,2428,4.754761904761905
2073262,4,B0002ABU5C,"Just bought ""Rocky and Bullwinkle, Season 2""

It is 4 double sided disks

Disc 1-A, shows 1-6

Disc 1-B, shows 7-13

Disc 2-A, shows 14-19

Disc 2-B, shows 20-26

Disc 3-A, shows 27-33

Disc 3-B, shows 34-40

Disc 4-A, shows 41-47

Disc 4-B, shows 48-52 and ""Special Features""

There's a lot of fun on these discs, unfortunately for those of us with multi-disc players, in order to watch the shows in order we have to keep stopping our machines to flip the disc over. I suppose its a small price to pay for classic TV cartoons like this but it would have been nice if they had thought a little further ahead.",1093910400,7,608,4.348214285714286
2073263,5,B0002ABU5C,"First, anybody who has seen Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends when the series was initially presented or more recently on VHS, knows that the animation is packed with layered references to literature, politics, and society's mores. Because of this clever layering, children and adults can enjoy these fabulous and entertaining episodes all about the battle between good and evil.

  On another note, I wonder ""if"" the turtle who was never satisfied with his lot in life, i.e. the end moral being ""Be what you is and not what you is not,"" will be among the ""friends"" (was not released on the VHS tapes several years ago)?",1093478400,2,615,4.783018867924528
2073264,5,B0002ABU5C,The covorart says 6 but the description says 4. I think it will be 4 though because what wood they need 6 discs for? I like the covorart alot better for this season. i cant wait until its out.,1089849600,2,192,3.948717948717949
2073265,5,B0002ABU5C,"If the description above is correct (52 episodes) we'll be getting the storylines UPSIDAISIUM (36 segments) and METAL-MUNCHING MICE (16 segments).
At this rate, it will take 6 Boxed Sets to finish the series.
I'm hoping that at some point, they re-instate the closing credits theme with the names in lights and the explosions at the end. That's the best version of the Bullwinkle theme and it's absent from the Season 1 box.
Also, the artwork says 6 discs while the description says 4 double sided discs. Which is correct and which is a filthy liar?",1088726400,6,549,4.729166666666667
2073266,5,B0002ABU5C,"This boxset contains the remainder of ""The Rocky Show"" episodes that aired on ABC from 1959-61. It became the Bullwinkle Show on NBC for the next three seasons.  Don't expect the real broadcast version of the show being packaged as episodes.  The Rocky and Bullwinkle adventures on the first boxset were in proper order. But the inbetween cartoons were from all over the five seasons of the show. Mr. Peabody and Fractured Fairy Tales were mingled with later cartoons: Dudley Do-Right and Aesop & Son. If this goes in order and they contain the remainder of the Rocky Show episodes, the adventures are:
Upsidasium
Metal-Munching Mice
Greenpernt Oogle
Rue Brittania
Buried Treasure
The Last Angry Moose
Wailing Whale
It will be nice to see clear copies of the Rocky and Bullwinkle commercials.  Bullwinkle does an amazing song to sell ""Trix"" cereal.
It will be interesting to see how they work the Bullwinkle Show boxsets since they'll have only 21 Bullwinkle's Corners, 52 tandems (Mr. Peaboy/Dudley - Fractured/Aseops), and 85 R&B ""episodes."" Here's hoping there's just one more boxset so that we don't have to wait 2 years for the remaining episodes",1086220800,25,1151,5.015706806282722

Granted, I remember the show being on Quad Cities channel 8 on Sunday mornings in the 1970s and being called ""The Bullwinkle Show"", where it opened with the star dancing to ""da-nah-nah-NAH-NAH, da-nah-nah-NAH-NAH,..."" and I understand that certain rights to names and such are obtained or not obtained, but Christ, it's annoying to have this long, unfamiliar opening titles sequences ruin my nostalgia.

2073288,2,B0002ABU5C,"The contents on this DVD release are not why I give this such a low rating.  It's the quality control of the production.  To save on costs, the manufacturer put the episodes on flipper discs.  Flippers are notoriously bad quality products, which is why they hardly use them any more.  If you get this set, be sure to test EACH side of all 4 discs.  This should have been released as 8 DVD-9's, not 4 flippers with DVD-9's on each side.  With flippers, you're lucky if they arrive from the mail playable at all.  The Outer Limits Season 1 came on flippers and out of 8 sides, only 2 were readable.  The other 6 wouldn't even recognize as playable at all!  Wonder Woman also had a season released on flippers and one of its discs wasn't playable.  The Universal Monsters Legacy collections were initially released on flippers and there were tons of quality control issues with customers trying to play them.  Universal eventually finally got it through its thick head and last year released a new version of the Legacy collections on DVD-9 non flipper discs.

Bottom line is the episodes are as good as they used to be, with the odd edits here and there to change the title card of the show and the new voice over that announces the show's name.  Stupid edits, but it seems that everyone who owns DVD content thinks it's their right and duty to make stupid edits to the contents on the DVD's they release.  However, be sure you can read ALL the contents on all 8 sides.  Otherwise, you're probably in for a long series of sending your DVD's back and hoping you'll get a release where the discs are all playable, but you most likely won't.",1441152000,3,1636,4.47972972972973

The 2nd-longest story arc in the whole Rocky and Bullwinkle series has 36 episodes in 18 shows, Upsadaisium, to kick off this 4-double-sided-disc set, all single-layered on each side and in LP mode! You also get 6 other, much shorter, stories, all 7 starring ""Moose and Squirrel"", and also featuring Captain Peter Wrongway Peachfuzz, the Moonmen Gidney and Cloyd, Boris and Natasha, their Fearless Leader and Pottsylvania's #1 crime boss, the powerful but tiny Mr. Big! There's also 156 segments here, with and without bridging sequences, of Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop and Son, Bullwinkle's Corner, Mr. Know-it-all, the Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club, Peabody's Improbable History, and Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties! Some episodes have small bugs in them, no one knows why, but all my set's discs work just fine, on both sides! An unbelievable amount of content on just 4 discs, along with bonus features on disc 4B, such as a hilarious montage made for this set called Moose Calls: The Best of Bullwinkle Sings (and Boris Badenov's Mile-long Record), an interview with June Foray about her working on this iconic series, a sneak peek of season 3 (From the Kirwood Derby story), and 3 Retromercials of Bullwinkle with Cheerios, all with side-by-side comparisons with the pencil tests and the finished animation via your DVD player's ""angle"" button. If you thought season 1 had lots of witty, wacky humor from the brilliant minds of Jay Ward and Bill Scott, you'll get literally twice as much with this set! Over halfway through this set, the 2nd season's opening and ending changes to those of season 1, but with season 2's music mixed in with them, as Jay Ward would've wanted, so the legend says; so we still don't hear the ""circus"" theme, or the originals of most of the other segments, in any authorized Rocky and Bullwinkle release from ClassicMedia or DreamWorks. You're in for a huge amount of ""mellerdramatic"" adventures with season 2, for a small price! Since season 2 is now in a single DVD case, let's hope the double-sided discs can handle such ""green"" treatment! ""Well, it looks as if our time has just about run out.""

The photo and listing for this item would have you believe that this is one of the beautiful boxed sets matching the other season collections that has a cover box with a multiple-panel illustrated fold-out with all of the CD's that are individually imprinted with great artwork.  IT IS NOT!
What you have here is, indeed, the Second Season of R&B.  However, it is produced and packaged in a cheap format in a single CD-type case with cover, inside of which are two CD's that appear blank except for content info printer around center hole.  Each CD is recorded on both sides, so while you do have 4 CD's of content, you have to flip them over to watch 1/2 of the season.
If you have previously purchased season collections of R&B, this will not match your other collections.

2073362,5,B0002ABU5C,"I love Rocky and Bullwinkle more now than when I was a kid, and season two is one of the best. It's amazing you can get so much wonderful entertainment for such a low price, and despite the occasionally frustrating packaging, the set is worth so much more.

Season two features several of Rocky and Bullwinkle's most bizarre adventures, and the wacky humor, painful puns, and double meanings that go along with them. Kids always liked the series as it is silly and visually interesting, but the subtext of these shows is definitely for adults, and I particularly enjoy it as a glimpse into the cold war past with Boris and Natasha being the wonderful and buffoonish stand-ins for agents of the Soviet Union (subjects, of course, of ""Fearless Leader."")

There are several serials in this set, my favorite of which are the seemingly endless ""Upsidasium"" episodes, one of the best-written Bullwinkle storylines ever. The set also features Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop and Son, Dudley Do-Right, and Peabody and Sherman doing what they do best, as well as the wonderful links and miscellaneous bits that make Rocky and Bullwinkle such a delight.

If you haven't seen these in a while, this is a great set at a bargain price and you owe it to yourself to get it without delay; if by some chance you have never seen the show, you need to waste no time and get this set immediately (or better yet, the complete series in the ""Complete Bull"" box set.)

When I was kid, we had Black & White TV -parents didn't get COLOR set until all the kids left home! Really enjoy seeing show again, but quickly realized is true what another reviewer has touched upon.. that MAJORITY of duration of show is filled up by time consuming, repetitive sequences shown over and over in each episode.. watch me pull a rabit out of my hat.. ect. I never noticed it as a child but now, as an adult, it has literally put me to sleep numerous times!! I've had to play episodes several times to try and stay awake! I suspect that back in the 1960's they couldn't afford to do all new animation each episode, so only the actual stories were new each time. But is nostalgic remenicing to see them again IN LIVING COLOR!  Wish SONY would put out Season Four!! I have all three seasons and would snatch up Season Four!",1224633600,,940,4.340909090909091

2073401,5,B0002ABU5C,"Even in this age of tremendous animation geared specifically not for children, (Simpsons, King of the Hill, Family Guy, etc. . . .) The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show still has to be rated as one of the all time great adult cartoons. Creator and master-mind Jay Ward had a unique sense of humor that was two-part silly surrealism and one part subtle-yet-caustic sarcasm. He did not seem capable of writing down to a cartoon audience, and he always assumed everyone got the joke (and, amazingly enough, tons of baby boomers did, along with their Korean-War generation parents).

The animation was, to be kind, stylized (not even quite as good as the ""limited animation"" of the great Hanna-Barbara cartoons of the 1960's), but what these cartoons lacked in lush graphics and great backgrounds, they more than made up for in great comic writing and imagination.  Season Two had some of the most memorable flights of brilliance like ""Metal Munching Mice"" - a 16-episode jaunt that had six-foot metal ""moon mice"" bent on destroying America by devouring television antennas. ""Upsidasium,"" another season-two classic, spanned a whopping 36 episodes and revolved around the anti-gravity metal, Upsidasium, sought after by all governments of the world (a tremendous and playful riff on the nuclear paranoia of the late 1950's and early 1960's). And what baby boomer didn't love all the additional special features (""And now here's something we hope you really like."") like Fractured Fairy Tales, Dudley Do-Right, Aesop's Fables, and (my personal favorite) Peabody's Improbable History.

Yet, finally, what made these cartoons historic in their greatness was the staggering alignment of vocal talent. Bill Scott was the voice of Bullwinkle and June Foray (the all time champ of female voice actors) supplied the voice for not only Rocky but also for Natasha, Nell Fenwick, and many and many additional voices. Then there was the great Paul Frees doing Boris, Captain Peachfuzz, Cloyd the Moon Man, and Inspector Fenwick.

The list goes on:  Hans Conried (Snidely Whiplash), Walter Tetley (Sherman), Charles Ruggles (Aesop), and Jullie Bennett (all the odd female voices in Fractured Fairy Tales that Foray didn't do, like The Fisherman's Wife). This show even had the greatest vocal talent ever, Daws Butler, on board doing the voice of Aesop Jr. in the Aesop`s Fables feature.

All in all, the greatest alignment of vocal talent ever assembled. Do not miss it. Any season of this classic television treasure will do. --- Mykal Banta",1182988800,4,2516,5.139364303178484

Kids enjoyed the good guy-bad guy antics of Rocky and Bullwinkle vs. Boris and Natasha while parents reveled in the creative, wholesome and usually silly parables.

Imagine seeing The Andy Griffith Show and not hearing the whistling theme song.  It's also annoying that they used the opening credit segment that showed the name of the show as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE AND FRIENDS, when it was really ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS.  If you notice, when that segment plays,  the voice is NOT that of William Conrad, but rather, someone who ""sounds"" like him.

2073407,4,B0002ABU5C,"This is filled with Good stuff, as is to be expected with any Bullwinkle set. The second season was filled with fun. Sherman and Peabody nearly got the axe in Mexico for the Pancho Villa parody that appears here (which seems mild in comparison to the Frito Bandito a few years later).

A note about the beginning credits. The originals in 1959-60 had Rocky asking Bullwinkle what was he writing and our man said ""the name of our sponsor,"" and Rocky would reply ""but that's not his name"" and they would cut into a General Mills cereal commercial and back to the into where Boris msleads them into a tunnel. This explains the fade out and fade in in the beginning credits of these shows.

The episodes as a whole are great as usual, but the extra features are a tad weak. The Bullwinkle Cheerios commercials were not the best of this genre (the original Moose commercails for Trix and General Mills were far more entertaining), and somebody had the bright idea of showing these on screen in tandem with the original pencil tests. Who but the most ultra-hardcore need-to-get-a-life animation geeks want to see this? The finished product will do fine, thank you.

2073409,5,B0002ABU5C,"Back with their second season of groan inducing puns, it's Rocky and Bullwinkle!!!

This time around, we get 52 half hour episodes on 4 double-sided DVD's.  That'll keep you watching and laughing for quite some time.  There are seven plots for our heroes this go around: Upsidaisium (by far the longest with 36 segments), Metal Munching Mice, Greenpernt Oogle, Rue Britannia, Buried Treasure, The Last Angry Moose, and Wailing Whale (featuring that fearsome creature, Maybe Dick.)

Of course, each episode also features either a Fractured Fairytale or an Aesop Fable; Bullwinkle's Corner, Mr. Know-It-All, or a Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club segment; and Dudley Do-right or Peabody's Incredible History.  In fact, this set contains my favorite Dudley segment, ""Saw Mill.""

The set this time around has a Sherman and Mr. Peabody theme and they get a couple page write up in the included booklet.

The set includes 16 minutes of extras on the final disc.  The highlight of these is an interview with June Foray, voice of Rocky, Natasha, and countless other characters in the show.  There are also three Bullwinkle commercials for Cheerios, a segment from ""Kirwood Derby,"" part of the next season set (hopefully due out fall 2005), and a downright hysterical ad for ""Moose Calls: The Best of Bullwinkle Sings.""

Purests will note that the opening and closing from the last season set is once again present for almost all of episodes.  It changes for the final 9 - no idea why.  Personally, I didn't grow up watching the show, so these don't mean much to me.  A little more annoying is the presence of the mostly clear ""R&B"" in the lower right hand corner for a couple minutes each segment.  My biggest complain is that the middle segment (Bullwinkle's Corner or Mr. Know-It-All) isn't included in the episode guide in the booklet.  On the plus side, the full frame picture is super clear and practically free from dust.  The mono sound, while not impressive by today's standards, gets the job done perfectly.

The R&B artwork isn't the most meticulous in animation history. Still, it's quite strong enough to carry the bad puns, strange views of history and fairy tales, and all the rest that made R&B so much fun.

The only disappointment is that the second season ran into trouble near the end, around episode 43. The animation quality went down, and there were few or no new extras (Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop and Son, Mr. Peabody, Dudley Doright).

2073425,4,B0002ABU5C,"I finally finished watching the second Rocky and Bullwinkle DVD set.  Much to my very pleasant surprise, starting on show #44 on disc 4, they used the FIRST season opening and closing title/credits sequences!  Like with the second year opening/closing sequences, this was the very first time I had seen these in color.  Mind you, this is not the original theme music used, which I think was better synchronized with the action on the screen, still it is great to finally again see Rocky and Bullwinkle chased up and down the hill by the loosened pinwheels!  The split-second shot showing their faces in horror as they realize the fireworks are coming loose is my favorite pose of the Frostbite Falls duo!

Those of you who probably saw Rocky and Bullwinkle on TV for the first time during the years of repeats are familiar with only the dancing moose opening title sequence.  I saw ""Rocky and His Friends"" when it first aired in the late 1950s and early 1960s and I take sheer delight in seeing these original title sequences again.

Two other nice touches are:  (1) On this DVD set we see several of the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club"" cartoons which took the place of ""Bullwinkle's Corner"" or ""Mr. Know It All"" on some programs.  In Keith Scott's book ""The Moose That Roared"" it says that there were only nine ""Fan Club"" cartoons.  (2) We finally get to see a few of the Bullwinkle cereal commercials.  There are SO MANY more!

I do wish, however, the booklet would have listed each ""Bullwinkle's Corner"", ""Mr. Know It All"", and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club"" cartoon by title like all the other cartoons on each disc.

Additional comments added at a later date:

This DVD set contains all of the Rocky and Bullwinkle catoons from Season 2.  There are 52 half-hour programs on this DVD set.  No, they did not have a new program on the air every week that year.  Referring again to Keith Scott's book ""The Moose That Roared"", during the second year that this program was on ABC television, there were new programs TWICE a week, Thursdays and Sundays.  Production for this season began soon enough to produce this many episodes.  There are twice as many episodes on this DVD set as on the Season 1 set but at no increase in price from most retailers.  Quite a bargain.

I do wish the booklets included in this series would list the original broadcast dates for the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons if not the other features as well.",1096675200,33,2430,4.617715617715618
2073426,4,B0002ABU5C,"Good news and bad news.  The good news is that you can view this timeless comedy classic in far better shape than most anyone younger than 50 has ever seen.  The bad news is that the surviving prints are not pristine, and the animation wasn't that clean in the first place.  Therefore, like the Looney Tunes ""Golden Collection,"" the DVD format means that you get to see the cartoons in their full glory from the best available source material, including (moving) dust, scratches, visible overlays, etc.  Still, that seems a small price to pay to view 40-50 year old artifacts of the zenith of non-computerized animation, an era that may never be repeated.  An outstanding value for the sheer amount of programming material you get for the low price.

One minor complaint is that some deliberate content editing has been done.  In particular, some music elements seem missing.  I was looking forward to acquiring this collection (and future seasons) due to fond memories of some side-splitting moments.  These include the ""Mr. Know-It-All"" segment on ""High Fidelity"" and a Dudley Do-Right episode where a fur smuggling ring (which hid the furs in musical instruments) is foiled when a tuba player rips into the ""Wabash Cannonball"" and starts spewing furs all over the stage.  I was pleased to find the ""High Fidelity"" segment on the second side of disk two.  However, I originally recall that during a gag with reel-to-reel tape, Bullwinkle not only breaks into a Highland dance in a kilt (""Oooh, must have put on a *Scotch* tape!""), he sings the lyrics to a Scottish song.  On the DVD, only the bagpipe music is heard, not the lyrics.  Was this edited from the original, and if so, was it due to failure to clear the necessary music rights?  If so, it's a shame, as it renders the gag somewhat less funny (as I wanted to share it with others who likely haven't seen the version that I have).",1096243200,12,1891,4.725609756097561
2073427,1,B0002ABU5C,"I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH SEASON 2 OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE,NOT WITH THE CONTENT,THAT WAS GREAT;HOWEVER, WITH THE WAY IT WAS DELIVERED. SONY - WONDER WENT ON THE CHEAP, THEY DOUBLE RECORDED ON EACH DVD. THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO FLIP EVERY DVD TO SEE THE SHOWS IN ORDER. THAT TO ME IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND NOT MENTION WHEN YOU ORDER OR ON THE BOX. SONY-WONDER SHOULD BE ASHAME OF IT SELF. SEASON 1 WAS ONLY RECORDED ON ONLY ONE SIDE, LIKE IT'S SUPPOSE TO.",1094860800,17,453,4.341176470588235
2073428,5,B0002ABU5C,"I've really enjoyed this new 'season' of Rocky & Bullwinkle. Notice I say 'season' because it includes things from succeeding seasons. Dudley Do-Right didn't appear until the Bullwinkle Show, I believe. Nevertheless this is an excellent compilation with almost double the material of Season One. These disks are double-sided. It's amazing how little the humor has aged in these wonderful cartoons since they first appeared. Classic humor! And so much of it! There are not many extras but I was happy to see the included interview with June Foray(which I had requested in my review of season one). It is short but sweet. For the next season perhaps she might do a commentary on some of the stories. As you probably know she was the voice for Rocky, Natasha and numerous fair damsels, witches, etc. She is a living treasure, having essentially established THE 'wicked witch' with her voice acting for Witch Hazel at Warner Brothers. In fact, as Chuck Jones said, Mel Blanc was the ""male June Foray""!",1094601600,9,997,4.905325443786983

8025165,4,B0002ABU5C,"Well, first off we have a beautiful box set containing all 7 story arcs from the second season of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Far more material than the first season ever gave us. While season 1 had only ""Jet Fuel Formula"" and ""Box Top Robbery"", this complex box set includes:  ""Upsidaisium"", ""Metal munching Mice"", ""Greenpernt Oogle"", ""Rue Brittania "", ""Buried treasure"", ''The Last Angry Moose"", and ""Whailing Whale"".  The highlight of this set is ""Upsidaisium"", since it is the second longest R&B story arc . The first longest was ""Jet Fuel Formula"" , which covers 40 episodes ; ""Upsidaisium"" contains 36.  Now, about the set: Contains 4 double sided disks; a booklet; 7 story arcs that vary in length; and some complex packaging. And if you want more R&B after buying  this, then go on to season 3. But if you like these cartoons, then by all means , buy this!",1487376000,,858,4.7
