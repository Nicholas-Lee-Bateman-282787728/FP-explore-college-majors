Poor quality production value, very UNATTRACTIVE couples, crappy looking sex, simply all around unpleasant. If you actually do give MONEY for this, remember this review.  Worse than the ""2 Girls 1 Cup Reaction""!!

Buy at your own risk. There's far too many nicer things you can buy for $23 that your loved would enjoy instead of *this*... If you do buy it, remember this post... you'll see everything here was and is true in my representations for you.

8466011,2,B000IYV0KC,"unless you are completely oblivious of anything relating to sex, I would not order this dvd. I mean, if you have never read a Cosmo magazine or anything, then go ahead. I would recommend this for an older couple who has never had sex, or has any painfully obvious questions you want answered. Or maybe if you are a lonely (virgin) guy and know nothing about yourself sexually. Hope this was helpful.",1202428800,14,399,4.555555555555555
