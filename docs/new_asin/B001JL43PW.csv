Problem is, with this absolutely horrendous 2003 MRG flick, the plot is so bad that the gratuitous sex scenes can't make up for it. This movie is so meandering, nonsensical and unwatchable that the only thing that kept me from rating it two stars is one really hot scene in which a very attractive woman has sex with somebody other than her husband, while her husband watches, in some kind of kinky club. Pretty much everything else, from the ugly female lead to the fat male lead, is bad, and even worse, totally perplexing.

MRG is an unworthy successor to Mystique Films, and all of these years later everybody knows that, but this movie (Is it ""Naked Passions,"" ""Naked Passion,"" or ""Sin Control""? In different places on the packaging it is called each of these three) is an absolute embarrassment and from start to finish I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. The ""plot"" surrounds a magazine editor and her subordinate, who is helping her generate ideas incorporating more sex into the magazine  because, of course, sex sells.

And that's it as far as plot. What happened here, best I can figure out, is that MRG took snippets of other movies off of the cutting-room floor and used them to ""flesh"" this thing out at 68 minutes. In between each sex scene is a setup back in the editor's office. Problem is that the setups don't make any sense, and in large part don't match the succeeding scenes at all. Additionally, with the exception of the one mentioned above, the sex scenes aren't even that good. What a train wreck!",1374969600,,1674,4.57
8313025,2,B001JL43PW,Unfortunately I just dislike movies where actresses have silicone augmented breasts.  It is sad in our cultur the Playboy/Hefner effect is so pervazive.,1342396800,,152,5.608695652173913
8313026,5,B001JL43PW,"If you are looking for lots of things to see in a movie, I would recommend you this.....very very interesting and its real good. Enjoy as much as you can....the storyline of this film even though is quite thin, but is basically talking about sex magazine writer decussion about sex in his work and end up he having sex with the boss of the comapny whom help him to produce his magazine after they strike the deal. recommended to those whom like very good erotic films and also to couples whom also interested in this genre of film.
