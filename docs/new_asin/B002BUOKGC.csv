Is anyone else having trouble playing this DVD on North American DVD players?

I've tried it on a Computer DVD player (supposedly ""Region Free"") as well as my home DVD player (Region 1), and it won't play on either.

Do I have a defective DVD?",1510099200,,334,4.1875
8361972,5,B002BUOKGC,"Pop with great musicianship. Great singing. Great songs. In my top tier of thousands of titles owned. This band should not move to the sidelines, ever. Probably difficult to reach a younger audience. Not sure why. My sons like this band. What's not to love.",1493510400,,257,4.733333333333333
8361973,5,B002BUOKGC,"What a treat for those of us who will probably never get a chance to see the Bears live.  This DVD has excellent video and audio quality, plus great extras.  The Bears are truly one of the great pop/rock bands, and deserve so much more recognition than they have received.  In an alternate universe, they would stand with the greatest of all time.  The songs, the singing, the musicianship and the vibe are all fantastic!  Thanks to the excellent production, you are right there in the front row in a small club.  What could be better than this?",1310601600,2,545,4.510204081632653
