196014,5,1575235846,"I'VE DONE KRIPALU YOGA, BEEN TO THE KRIPALU CENTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND A SATTELITE CENTER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, AND I'VE DONE GURUMUKH'S YOGA TAPE, WHICH I ENJOYED AND I'VE DONE CAROL CARLSON'S TAPE. THEY ARE BOTH EXCELLENT TAPES BUT THE RELAXATION FOLLOWING CAROL CARLSON'S ""KUNDALINI YOGA: WITH GRACE AND STRENGTH"" WAS MUCH MUCH DEEPER AND MORE PROFOUND. THE MOVEMENTS IN THIS VIDEO ARE NOT NEARLY AS BOUNCY AS GURUMUKH'S, BUT THE WORKOUT IS JUST AS INTENSE. I FIND GETTING WARMED UP WITH GURUMUKH'S TAPE AND THEN DOING CAROL CARLSON'S TAPE BRINGS ME HOME.",1010620800,7,559,4.957446808510638
196015,1,1575235846,"I am a certified Prana Yoga Instructor (based on Kripalu Yoga) and I recently discovered Gurmukh's Kundalini Yoga tape, which I think is wonderful.  In my quest to learn more about Kundalini Yoga I ordered this Carol Carlson video.  After no more than 10 minutes into this tape I had to turn it off.  What is she thinking to do a backbend with breath of fire as her first asana, with no options for modifications for beginners or people with shoulder, wrist or back issues....and even for advanced students no warm up??? I could not go on I was so annoyed at her.  I found her tone condecending and annoying. Yoga students seeking an energizing, revitalizing, life changing experience should try Gurmukh or Ravi Singh, both instructors present the practice from a place of love and healing, yet the work outs are physically challenging.",1005177600,63,836,4.784722222222222
196016,4,1575235846,This is one of the best videos I have practised with. Carol Carlson is a wonderful teacher. She is calm and very precise in her instructions. One receives a full workout together with calming meditation and relaxation. I highly recommend this video.,1001635200,2,249,4.9523809523809526
196017,4,1575235846,"I purchased this video not really knowing what to expect. The instructor moves along easily in this video, giving the viewer time to change positions. I would recommend this video to anyone starting kundalini yoga.",998611200,,214,5.142857142857143
196018,5,1575235846,"I have been a hatha yoga practioner for years.  This is the first video I ever did of Kundalini yoga.  I loved it.  I felt so relaxed in mind and body.  After I had finished with the video, I desired to go right into a  meditation.  It felt wonderful.  I have never experienced this kind of  yoga before.  I love hatha yoga but this yoga... is different in a lovely  way.  In a subtle way, I just felt energetically different.  I felt happier  the rest of the day.  It is strenuous and physically challenging yet at  the same time very spiritual.  Worth every penny.  I can't wait to try  other Kundalini videos and learn more about what Kundalini is all about.",945907200,29,661,4.322314049586777
196019,1,1575235846,"Having a well rounded background in Kundalini Yoga I can say with utmost confidence that this video is not the way you want to be introduced to the  practice of Kundalini Yoga.  I have NEVER seen any Yogi do ""Breath of  Fire"" in every single asana done....ever.  Why, because it's NOT done!",942796800,17,290,4.519230769230769
196020,5,1575235846,"It is by far one of the best overall fitness routines I have ever used. I do not like bulky muscles; I prefer sleek, trim and toned; supple movements, etc. This tape helps you to stretch, elongate, strengthen and condition your body. I felt peaceful and refreshed and used the tape every day. I am ready to purchase another and start again. I just loved it!",1334361600,,357,4.424242424242424
196021,2,1575235846,"I have this in VCR tape form and simply wanted to buy it again in DVD form, but the $43.00 price is ridiculous.  Most yoga DVDs are $7.99 to $14.99.  The price would have to come WAY DOWN for me to consider re-buying it!!  For that reason, I am giving this a bad review.  If you want people to experience a good kundalini class, you must make it accessible for the average person's ability to pay for it.",1318636800,,404,4.141025641025641
196022,2,1575235846,"I found this DVD boring and the instructor had a strange attitude. She never smiled or had anything pleasant to say. The kriyas were rather advanced and she used the breath of fire too much. Part of the appeal in a workout DVD is the setup, and this one was bad.",1308700800,,262,4.1568627450980395
196023,3,1575235846,"I really like Kundalini yoga. I enjoy the breath work and seemingly odd exercises. There was something about Carol's style that took a bit to get used to. Sometimes she described the movements almost in metaphor but at least she was consistent so once you understood what she wanted you to do, you could follow the next time around. The part about the video that made it really hard to watch was the high pitched bells that were on the sound track. I think in person those bells are bearable, but I was cringing when I heard the ringing, to the point were I almost had to turn it off. I was surprised I made it through the dvd... This is one of my sensitivities so others may not notice or be affected by that sound.",1299888000,,716,4.272058823529412
196024,5,1575235846,"As a dancer, I find many yoga videos out there are incomplete in terms of whole body stretching.  This video, which was created by a dancer, does not require impossibly flexible poses, but it will challenge, stretch, and strengthen your entire body as well as your mind.  I have been using this program for years, and even though I have sampled many other yoga programs over the years as well, I always come back to this one.  It never gets boring, and I truly feel that I have completely toned my entire body when I am through.  My old VHS version finally wore out and so I was lucky to find this in DVD format.  If you want the perfect yoga routine, this is it...!!",1267488000,3,667,4.304
196025,5,1575235846,"Great yoga tape. - Have used it for years.  Good for beginners or more experienced yoga practitioners.  A couple of poses are challenging (including the first, which immediately discouraged a couple of my friends who tried it) but overall it's a great workout.  IMO, this is the best Kundalini tape out there.  Just as a note - highly recommend that you have a yoga mat (a good one that you won't slip on) for this workout.",1260230400,,423,4.526315789473684
196026,5,1575235846,"Excellent DVD on Kundalini Yoga. Carol Carlson is excellent. Watch it all the way through, then do the steps. She knows her stuff!! Kundalini yoga is by far the best yoga I've done to tone the body and keep your insides working correctly.",1252800000,,238,4.558139534883721
196027,5,1575235846,"I have used this tape for several years, starting at a time when I was in a highly stressful management position.  It was difficult to start, I needed nearly one year to learn the breathing and poses in the way they are useful.  I tried many other programs.  This one is the best.  My physical condition and mental state are excellent.  I am 66 years old, play tennis 4 times per week and golf on Sundays.  I wear no braces, wraps, or supports of any kind.  I work muscle straign out with this yoga routine.  I work mental straign out the same way.  Mastering the breathing has tightened up my core, keeps me looking great - flat stomach and all.  I suffer from restless leg syndrome. Using baby pose every night before retiring brings relief to the nerves and lets me sleep.  I can't say enough good things about this tape.  I recommended it to many of my friends, however, it is NOT AN EASY routine, and they mostly give up.  If you are strong and want the most and best from life.  Buy this tape and teach yourself to become more able mentally and physically than you ever thought you could be.  A true 5 star program. If you are not weak of resolve, feable and easily discouraged, give yourself a chance to start this program today.  I did not say try - I said start.",1240876800,,1271,4.29957805907173
196028,5,1575235846,"Thank God this made it to DVD, I've already worn out two VHS tapes. I was fortunate enough to take classes with Carol in NYC before she moved to the wilds of northern Minnesota (my wife and I were really bummed). She and Ravi Singh were the best teachers we ever had (I own a bunch of Ravi's discs too but Carol's is my overall favorite). You don't have to be terribly experienced at yoga to enjoy this set, though it helps to be in reasonably good shape. It really puts you through your paces and leaves you feeling relaxed and energized. For me it is the perfect workout and I can't recommend it enough.",1200700800,3,605,4.269565217391304
196029,4,1575235846,"I actaully enjoyed this DVD overall. I liked Kundalini yoga A Journey through the Chakras W/Ravi Singh better. They both had many of the same poses & many uses of breath of fire for many of them. The music worked much better, faster in Ravi Singh. I did feel good doing this dvd & as it progressed I did feel more energy. Her voice feels a little stiff & it's just her alone w/blank white background. It didn't have a wrmup & got right to it, but I as able to keep up & didn't get bored or want to turn it off though I get bored easily.",1166054400,,536,3.9722222222222223
196030,5,1575235846,"This is beautiful, energizing and centering yoga.  The benefits include a real work-out integrated with deep relaxation and meditation.  It leaves you with an afterglow of tranquility, energy and vitality.  Although I have invested in plenty of other yoga DVDs, I find that I keep coming back to this one time and again, as it feels like deep nourishment on both a physical and spiritual level. I highly recommend it to all.  Many heartfelt thanks to Carol, for creating such a deeply moving program, and then sharing it with the world!",1159142400,,536,4.857142857142857
196031,5,1575235846,"Anyone who thinks this workout is disjointed clearly is not meditating while moving through this kriya.  First, it's time to shed some light on what this type of kundalini sequence actually is.  This is definately a Yogi Bhajan sequence.  Bhajan created several kriyas with similar names - ""Grace & Prosperity,"" ""Flexibility & the Spine,"" for example.  ""Grace & Strength"" is a fusion workout existing in an interzone between the original ""Warrior Workout"" and ""Flexibility & the Spine.""  Like the ""Warrior Workout,"" there is a running segment, frog pose, and several back bends like bow.  Like the flexibilty or spinal kriyas, there are cobra, seated wide angle forward bends, wheel, crow squats, and standing back/forward bends.  Carol is showing you exactly how this kriya would have been taught by Yogi Bhajan.  Anyone who has ever done Ravi Singh's and Ana Brett's ""Ultimate Stretch Workout"" can see obvious similarities to this set.  The difference is that it has a more rapid motion, contains an aerobic component, a segment designed for the heart chakra, and a rather complex abdominal sequence in the middle of the set.  I personally think Carol magnificently explains breath of fire, what real strength is, and concludes her set with a beautifully inspired resting pose dialogue.  As she says, this set is to improve your strength, not prove your strength.  I have spent years doing power yoga, ashtanga, and kundalini.  This segment, in a similar mode to Donna Davidge, works on the body and the mind throughout the day after performing it in the morning.  Also, those hatha yoga critics who claim it is unsafe to begin in table top (truly one of the less difficult asanas) need to understand that before doing any intermediate kundalini sequence, one should already be warmed up.  Before I do this or any kundalini set, I perform the Five Tibetan Rites.  After doing any rigorous segment, Carol gives you more than ample time to consolidate your gains through a moment of still meditation.  Realize, if you are doing yoga simply to de-stress through deep breathing, kundalini yoga is less appropriate than hatha, ashtanga, or power yoga variations.  If you are doing this to actually raise kundalini, work the lymphatic, nervous systems, and increase the internal will linking the body and mind together, this is the type of yoga to do.  Upon finishing this workout, even though it is made up of an anti-intuitive sequence, I feel active, strong, defined, and just as ready to take action in my day as I would if I did power yoga.  Often, power yoga can make me feel too heavy or weighted down from too many held poses.  I like how this unusual sequence jump starts my heart after running/skipping in place, making me feel extremely light on my feet.  I also think her return to child's pose and her instructions on how to round up, using your abdominal muscles makes transitioning between meditating and action extremely fluid.  Those who have criticized this DVD should take a look at a kundalini book and understand the wide variety of sequences Bhajan created before displaying their obvious lack of knowledge to the world.  Carol Carlson didn't make this DVD for shock value, fame, or bedazzlement.  It is clear that she expresses a true, deep felt love of kundalini and a true urge to give you, the viewer, a true kundalini experience.",1144713600,26,3352,4.92170818505338
196032,5,1575235846,"For years, I've rented numerous fitness videos, purchasing a small fraction.  This was my introduction to Kundalini Yoga.  Before that, I was pretty fit for my 60's but had heart vulnerabilities (palps, borderline high blood pressure) plus stooping shoulders, less than limber back, etc. - despite regular fitness walking, hard outside work, and doing other routines, including machines.  Doctors suggested meds.

Often, exercise seemed a chore - not this time.  Carol's work-out is invigorating, challenging and fun.  Amazingly, it especially targets the heart muscle, while building strength, flexibility and stamina.  She's transforming spiritually, too.

At once, I noticed dramatic differences in my health and well being - less palps, lowered blood pressure, limbered back, etc.  My cardiologist remarked grinning broadly, ""Whatever you're doing, keep at it!""

Months later, I still fitness walk in nature, have added Gurmukh's beautiful Kundalini routine, total tune-up with Ravi Singh and Ana Brett + weight training and Pilates w/ Denise Austin (all gems).  These are my favorites.

My husband joins me now, and together we eagerly look forward to our A.M. rejuvenation.  To Carol Carlson, our heartfelt thanks.  It's like turning back the hands of time!  :)",1132012800,4,1267,5.526041666666667
196033,4,1575235846,"There are many different types of yoga and yoga routines. Vinyasa, which is great at building muscle, isn't for everyone. I like the cardio on this DVD, and I like the gentle ""meditations"" between sets of exercises. I feel extremely energized afterwards. It's a good practice for people who are intimidated by difficult poses. However, if you prefer a more regimented or athletic style, this one is not for you.",1125014400,2,411,4.885714285714286
196034,1,1575235846,"This DVD ranked at the lowest of my list of DVDs seen so far.
The Yoga asanas are the normals ones seen or followed by any format.
It jumps right into reverse back bends, quick breathing and so on. Beware of the abrupt sequences. Even for an advance yoga student\teacher, I would suggest doing the stretching on their own before using this.
I would put it in the category: Do not buy this to stretch and to follow Yoga as an exercise. Buy it or any Kundalini Yoga DVD to try and awaken your Kundalini. For others, find something else.

Level: Advanced (As a second session)
Instructions: Spoken
Modifications: Shown separately. Only one practitioner
Location: Studio
Duration: ~45 minutes",1119830400,2,688,4.781512605042017
196035,3,1575235846,"This is the first of the only two Kundalini yoga dvd's I have ever done so please take that into account.  It's different from most other yoga practices.  There are no sun salutations or balancing postures.  While I enjoyed the video, you do need to warm-up for about five minutes before you begin.  She starts off with table pose and holds it for quite awhile considering that it's the first pose.  The video got a little boring, but I did feel good after performing the ""breath of fire"", which is like kapalabhati breathing, during a few poses.  My biggest disappointment is that she only does downward dog once but she calls it triangle.  FYI, the other Kundalini that I tried was ""Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh,"" and I must admit it was invigorating.  So if you are going to buy one, pick Gurmukh's.  Only thing is, I never did it again. (Perhaps I was too busy thinking I needed a bunch of downdogs to feel accomplished...but I will do it again!)",1117670400,,949,4.535294117647059
196036,5,1575235846,"Contrary to the other reviews I read, I love this video and so does my girlfriend.  I told her about it years ago and she bought her own tape, I came here to find it on DVD and was shocked by the criticism I saw here.  My friend and I are not what one would call in shape or regular exercisers but we love the workout.  I love her voice and she does tell you to modify if you feel the need, but more importantly she talks you through it and says ""You can do it"" and just when I think I might not be able to I do it and feel great about it.  I have 2 Yoga tapes out of about 7 that I actually use and this is one of them.  When I use her tape I feel strong, empowered and awesome.  I can actually do this tape without having worked out in months.  I work out sporadically yet I can do this tape and love doing.",1113264000,4,809,3.723529411764706
196037,5,1575235846,"I have been doing kundalini yoga for 9 months now.  I am totally hooked.  I have other yoga dvds/videos which I try to do, but always gravitate to my kundalini yoga dvds.  I am no longer interested in becoming a human pretzel or a master of standing on my head.  I just want to be the radiant person I was meant to be and kundalini yoga will get me there faster than other types of yoga.  Having said all of that, after reading the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this video. I'm glad I did. It will be a staple in my kundalini DVD/video rotation.  I'd like to point out a couple of things to people who complained that it does not start out with an adequate warm-up/bad sequencing and the attitude of the instructor. First, Kundalini yoga is NOT like other types of yoga. If you are coming to it from another type of yoga, you need to hold your criticism and let it work for you. It is not form precise like Iyengar or flowing like ashtanga.  Yet it is powerful and can produce remarkable results.  Second, Kundalini yoga consists of sets or kriyas. Every single pose is in a set for a reason, physically and spiritually.  A good teacher will tell you what each pose does for you as the set progresses.  The sets are documented in manuals and books that the teachers follow, usually to the letter including breathing instructions, mantras and meditations. Warm-ups and music can be added depending on the teacher.  Some teachers are more creative than others and they may add extras to the class, such as warm-ups, music, words of wisdom, prayers, etc.  Carol chose to just present the kriya, probably as taught by Yogi Bhajan. This doesn't make it bad, just 'simple and unadorned'.  I personally loved the set.  The back bends are wonderful; the crow squats with arms is amazing.  As to her personality, it didn't bother me.  If you love kundalini yoga, as I do, add this one to your collection. Don't be put off by petty comments about her personality. It's irrelevant to the set. And if you really need a warm-up, put on a Ravi Ana DVD and just do the warm-up and then enjoy Carol's set.",1110672000,11,2090,4.446194225721785
196038,4,1575235846,"Having watched the tape first...I thought it looked more complex and then I did it the next day and found it was easier..more accessible than it appeared or than I thought. I would say that it is very nice overall. However, this is really an ADVANCED BEGINNER or INTERMEDIATE tape..like so many of tapes that do not stress this fact or pass for beginner by using the advertising. In addition, you should be WARMED UP already on your own before you do this tape..her first pose is a version of Bridge pose with breath of fire!..so be warmed up and ready to go in this case. Specifically, the demonstator does IMO embody the ""grace and strength"" slogan in both the poses and the way in which they are carried out. The length of time is good if you are looking for longer workout. She uses lots of ""Breath of Fire"". There is something calm and gentle about the flow and approach here..it could also be the effect of the music used. While there are ample rest times there seems to be very little time given in the rest ..the moment you are into it she is moving on. The last rest period seems a bit long in comparison. I've found that with tapes like this...(a good example being ""Lower Body Yoga""..with Susan Deason)...that the second and times afterwards you are no so caught off guard since you have the experience already. You eventually can just modify, even if you are a little late into our out of whatever pose, though this too can be a little annoying or distracting because the impending sense of having to keep up;not fall behind. GREAT COMPLIMENTS! to her outfit... cooling, calm, balancing, and most of all respect/ful to her body, the viewer, and yoga.",1106265600,2,1662,4.543333333333333

I wasn't too sure about the dvd when I started- but it seemed to be working on somethings that I don't get in a regular yoga class. So I decided to give it a month. I can say, a month later, that I can feel the difference and am very happy with the results. I just came back to see if she had another dvd out. The worst part of the cd is the kind-of new-agey talk but it's not that bad especially if you turn it down and put up your own music!",1099526400,2,553,3.8173913043478263
196040,1,1575235846,i was very dissappointed with this video because for being a yoga teacher for over a decade she starts off without any warmup in addition she went straight to a very difficult pose. I also felt that her intructions weren't very clear.,1093910400,4,234,4.595238095238095
196041,1,1575235846,"I tried this video this morning and was really disappointed.
 I have been doing yoga for 7 years, have over 70 yoga videos and study with a wonderful teacher with kundalini influences.
 There are two main points of contention I have with this program.
 1st: I felt this was very unsound in terms of it's physical presentation. In particular, there are no warmups before she plunges into an inverted table posture (if she considers that a warmup then I'm puzzled). For myself personally (and I am in excellent physical condition and my body is used to an intense yoga practice) I found it very dangerous to proceed like this. A sound yoga practice should gradually prepare the body for what is to come, this program doesn't do that at all.
2nd: She shows VERY few modifications which can also be dangerous to someone trying to follow her verbatim, but had I not been experienced with yoga and hadn't known how to modify I would've gotten hurt trying to follow her speed and range of motion (especially the insane speed which she takes cat-cow before your body is properly warmed up.)
 While I wanted to stop immediately into the tape I thought that I should bypass judgement until doing the whole tape. Unfortunately for me it didn't seem to get better.
 I really dislike having to write such a negative review because I get no enjoyment out of doing so, however I felt it important to share my opinion because folks might get hurt doing this tape if they don't know any better.
 While it was interesting to me to see a style of yoga such as this, I won't ever try to practice with this program again (unless I was already thoroughly warmed up with 30 minutes or more of a more sound practice).",1070323200,34,1693,4.552631578947368
196042,5,1575235846,"I have been an avid Gurmukh fan, enjoying the aerobic style of Kundalini Yoga.  Grace and Strength takes that to a new level, not as aerobic, but intense enough.

196043,4,1575235846,"I was always daunted to try Kundalini Yoga - just because the many cautions every book says one needs to be aware of. This DVD introduces one to Kundalini Yoga in a rather straight forward manner.
Working mainly along the spine - from the top to the bottom - the series of postures try to activate the energy centers along the spine. The Breath of Fire is introduced and used in many postures. This form of Yoga is more dynamic than Hatha Yoga; so many of those physically oriented especially beginners may find it interesting. The postures and beautifully demonstrated. The 70 minutes of it may seem to be a stretch to a beginner.
The author doesn't explain the precautions needed for one to practice this form of yoga and breath of fire. Many original texts on Yoga caution the practitioner against invoking the Kundalini energy if one isn't ready for it. Especially practising the Mula bandha, I personally have found it to be having a mostly negative effect on me - irritation, nightmares, etc; thus one has to be ready for the energy released due to the mula bandha and breath of fire.
As the editorial review cautions, this DVD is for experienced practitioners who are willing to cautiously experiment with Kundalini.",1051401600,3,1223,4.746478873239437

However, I found both the setting and the teacher to be somewhat lifeless and uninspiring.  While I find myself wanting the more gentle practice that this video offers, I still will reach for Gurmukh's more aerobic video because I am more inspired by the joy and love that eminates from Gurmukh while being surrounded by the lush, vibrant setting of Hawaii.",1043539200,,502,4.8023255813953485

When I finish it, I feel relaxed, energized and worked out from head to toe. I agree that there isn't much warm up--it's a little hard to tell when the ""workout"" begins--but I just start about 7 minutes into the tape and that's worked fine for me.
It's a very straightforward workout, not a lot of coddling. Ms. Carlson has a style which I can see might be interpreted by some people as slightly aloof, but to me it's like having a one-on-one class with a serious, professional instructor who really knows what she's talking about.
This video seems to have been made on a slightly smaller budget than the Gurmukh one, but in my opinion, beautiful scenery is nice if you're planning on sitting on your butt and just watching the video, but if you're doing it right, you probably won't notice. This video does have very nice, understated music, though, which does enhance the experience.",1039910400,4,1010,4.524590163934426
196047,4,1575235846,"I am a relative beginner to yoga, and have used two tapes. Grace and Strength with Carol Carlson and Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh. Carol Carlson is serious, energetic, and unaffected. Her straightforwardness was attractive as it countered the stereotypes I had harbored about yoga practice. As a New Yorker I liked her no nonsense style very much. The workout could be said to be difficult, but this was no problem as I usually rest during the last bits of each exercise.
Her thoroughly engaging seriousness and lack of affectation allowed me in and opened me up to other styles that I would have shunned. Gurmukh is such an example, who's style and voice at first seems nothing less than flaky-but who turns out to be just as serious and unaffected as Carlson. But, without the entre' provided by Carlson, I never would've gotten past minute one of Gurmukh. Both tapes complement one another perfectly. I use them both regularly.",1025827200,2,929,4.849056603773585

Yoga is important and so to supplement my personal routine, I wanted a DVD that was not stereotypically commercial. If you look at the different bookstores it is easy to see which ones are and which ones are not like this. If you can't get to a local yoga class, I would recommend this DVD. I personally found it refreshing and positive and if this is what you are looking for, then I would recommend it.",1017532800,,479,4.274725274725275
196049,4,1575235846,"From my self study of Kundalini Yoga, I find this tape to be true to the Kundalini philosophy. It is not for absolute beginers to yoga. I practice several styles of Yoga including Ashtanga and a more generic hatha yoga. I enjoy the change of pace and the challange this Kundalini yoga tape. The breath of fire discussed on this tape is certainly challenging to maintain, however, if done correctly it is NOT hyperventalation. I reccomend this tape for those who are open minded to moving through a different yoga paradigm.",1016236800,3,522,4.747252747252747

It's the same brilliant yoga workout on DVD that was on the video.

It leaves me feeling absolutely wonderful and has me approaching the transcendental via the physical.

Carlson is a master!",1474156800,,270,4.702127659574468

7798888,5,1575235846,I had this video when it was FIRST out on VHS. I love the video. it is a challenge. There are some great benefits to doing this video......Lymphatic workout is built in. The Breath of Fire is Wonderful. Do what you can and eventually you can do more. She is an Expert and one can't expect to be perfect the first few times out. it would not be a challenge or worth doing if it were EASY. it is Doable. I can't recommend this video enough. I have 2 copies. I have given it as a gift and i would suggest it and give it again and again.,1455235200,,533,3.9444444444444446

It isn't easy. You have to be willing to do the hard work, but it is totally worth it.

Really, I don't know what I would do without it. Thank you Carol Carlson!!

I would buy more of her yoga videos if I knew where to find them.",1392076800,,396,4.103896103896104
7798894,5,1575235846,"I love this tape. As a young child, about age 9 I think, someone gave me a book on basic yoga. I used to run and was athletic, but didn't really care for team sports, except to watch them like football, soccer and baseball. But personally,I liked ballet, running and gymnastics. I taught myself the postures and I always felt supple and healthy when doing yoga - it was a great way to stretch without building bulk. So one day I found this VHS tape created by Carlson and I loved it. I used it everyday and lent it to a friend of mine from Japan. Evidently she loved it, too, because she kept it! I just felt that she needed it and we are still good friends, but I missed my tape and the exercise, so I was very happy to find a source that stocked the tape, purchased it recently from Amazon, and I was thrilled by the quality of the tape. I also must admit that I am looking forward to the peace of ""doing yoga"" daily for health reasons and getting back into top shape. I believe yoga builds strength without putting stress on your body; keeps you fit without adding bulk. Personally, I like a ""runner's build,"" healthy, lean and strong and I love ballet, too, for its strength and grace. So overall, Carlson's tape, With Grace and Strength is a must for any athlete who wants to retain their suppleness, lean build and reduce stress. It is a great tape and she is an excellent teacher, in my opinion. May God bless her. Vicki",1378080000,,1427,4.288888888888889
