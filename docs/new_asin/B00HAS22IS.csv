8631395,4,B00HAS22IS,"Nice, solid role for Gabin.  Very atmospheric noir.  The last scene with the suspect is chilling.",1462233600,,97,5.0
8631396,3,B00HAS22IS,"Good movie but I found the plot a bit farfetched.
Why would a police inspector follow a woman when the suspect was a man and why Maigret would think that this woman's husband would be connected to the killings? I am going to read the book to see whether it makes more sense.",1446422400,3,274,4.188679245283019
8631397,4,B00HAS22IS,"Nicely photographed and acted, good tempo sustained throughout, this is catnip for fans of Simenon, as well as fans of Jean Gabin. Worth the viewing.",1440979200,,149,5.0

8631400,5,B00HAS22IS,Gabin is excellent as always and the b/w photography is the perfect way to see Simenon's Paris. My only minor complaint would be that it's too studio bound and not enough location shooting.,1396224000,6,189,4.757575757575758
8631401,5,B00HAS22IS,"If you're a fan of the legendary French star, Jean Gabin, old French films, or old-fashioned whodunits, this taut little b&w film directed by the very able Jean Delannoy,  is for you. Video Dimensions gives you the choice of white or yellow subtitles. The first of the Inspector Maigret-Jean Gabin crime thrillers, the print offered here is a little inky, but I suspect that's the way it looked in its original theatrical release.

The plot is about a serial killer in the slums of Paris. Inspector Maigret zeroes in on an adulteress (played by another legend, Annie Girardot). Not wanting to reveal any further so as not to spoil the fun, this movie, talky by today's standards, should hold crime fans' interest for the entire length of almost 2 hours.

Hopefully, Video Dimensions will continue to release additional Maigret ""films policiers"" in the future.",1394582400,8,859,4.951388888888889
