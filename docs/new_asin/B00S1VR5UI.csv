6947969,4,B00S1VR5UI,"Back when the working class was seen as ""progressive,"" and truckers were pop heroes and everyone had CBs, good buddy.  Back when fast food joints did not disfigure small towns with corporate logos and litter their streets in paper wrappers.  When most guys wore real hats, not plastic ballcaps.  And most of the Southern accents were real.  A time-machine glimpse into another world that seems near yet so far away.

The plot lacks a certain reality: our trucker hero could not, of course, barge into Slim Pickens' office and get a contract at rifle-point without being immediately tracked and busted by a horde of state police, even in those pre-GPS days.  It does end on a gritty note, however, symbolizing what did become of the truckers' hopes for independence and fairness.  Ironically, it was these same good buddies that swept Ronald Reagan into office, giving a hand to their own destruction.

A good nostalgia romp all the way around, down to Slim's flowered cowboy coat and the typewriters clacking in the background.  :)",1507680000,,1031,4.913294797687861

6948034,4,B00S1VR5UI,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father in law.  While my husband was growing up, he can remember his father watching his old VHS copy of this movie so many times that he wore the tape out and with the exception of catching it on television a couple of times, he's been unable to enjoy it since. Now released again as part of the 40th Anniversary Series, we are excited to have found this so Dad can again enjoy his favorite movie. I give it four stars because it is extremely lightweight and not a sturdy feeling case but since it's a gift it's yet to be seen as to how the dvd will hold up or the quality of playback. Once that's established, I will update this review. We're just happy to have found it at such a good price and look forward to seeing the look on Dad's face when he opens it on Christmas day!",1449532800,4,824,4.118012422360248

6948040,5,B00S1VR5UI,"Along with Steel Cowboy, I think this is hands down the movie made that involves Trucks, It's not as popular as Duel, Smokey and the Bandit, Convoy or Maximum Overdrive, But, I simply prefer This and Steel Cowboy over those movies, It's also great for the blue oval fans out there like myself, The Ford WT-9000 was one of my favorite trucks ever made, I feel this particular movie gets right down to it as far as realism and reality go, Sure, It might have a little bit of ""Hollywood's Twist"" in it, but, all in all not really that much",1445558400,2,536,4.316831683168317

6948054,3,B00S1VR5UI,"White Line Fever,1975(40th Anniversary Series,DVD,2015,Millcreek)is a interesting movie because of the lead actor who would later be on the shortlived Airwolf tv series and Slim Pickens is in it, Also Blue Mule is a nicely painted ""Bucket"". The story however even then is tired,I Don't like the Abortion Angle,the whole antiCorporate,AntiAuthority just beneath the surface. Great chase and Stunts and Jumps and even music,I got into it as a fan of the Trucker Genre and if you are a blue oval fan you will like the WT9000 Cabover(The CL9000 looked better which came later,and the GMC/Chevy Semis are better.)That being said if you ignore the typical blue-collar mumbojumbo masquerading for the movie you can still enjoy it. There is no Blu-Ray so far of White Line Fever, The DVD has no subtitles, no special features, and no trailers and no bonus anything. It does not even have a go to scene selection which none of this irks me. Grateful they re-released it again.",1442275200,4,967,4.938650306748467

6948061,4,B00S1VR5UI,I saw this one many years ago at a theater on Hollywood Blvd. I enjoyed the movie. Its one of the better B movies of its time. Its not a disappointment as so many B movies turn out to be. The disappointment is how Jan-Michael Vincent ruined his life and career with booze and drugs,1438300800,,281,4.127272727272727
6948062,5,B00S1VR5UI,Excellent movie. I remembered seeing this when I was a teenager. Brought back many memories.,1437955200,3,92,5.2
6948063,5,B00S1VR5UI,"One of the best, if not thee best of all the trucking movies. A lesser known movie than Convoy or Smokey and the Bandit but I feel this is that good if not better. Others might like this movie as well. Jan Micheal Vincent and all of the cast do a great job. This is not a cheesy film but a legit drama. A story of the little guy vs. the giant evil empire of big business. A struggle which for many truckers exists in real life today and makes the film relevant in my opinion. Truckers will love a look at the older rigs. Most aspects of this film are very realistic of course they added other element for the drama effect. Hard to believe this film is 40 years old, makes me feel old. The 5 stars might be a bit unintentionally misleading, it's no gone with the wind. It rates 5 stars for me because it is one of my all time favorite movies. In fairness, it is much closer to a 4 star film.  I hope you enjoy this film and one last thing, this film has been around 40 years for a reason, it's a great film for what it is.",1435276800,,1021,3.9563106796116503

6948068,4,B00S1VR5UI,"Jonathan Kaplan's 1975 action favorite features the then up-and-coming actor Jan Michael Vincent as an independent-minded trucker who battles corporate corruption and anti-union delegates as he attempts to create a dream life for his family but can't stop getting in trouble with those who want to see his rebellious spirit crushed. A rather convoluted plot for a mid-70's action picture, Kaplan goes overboard on a few of the set pieces, but the film is exciting, action packed, and it has a positive working class message that supports integrity rather than compromise. A real movie from the days when films drew in real actors and used real 35 mm and 75 mm lens cameras, ""White Line Fever"" is a forgotten drive-in favorite now (how's that for a paradox?), but if you love B-movies or action movies, Kaplan's film still has much to recommend it to audiences today. The great supporting cast includes L. Q. Jones, Slim Pickens, R. G. Armstrong, and even Martin Kove, all of whom do a superb job playing their old reliable roles as crooked hoods and dirty villains. Old-fashioned, and more TV-like rather than cinema-like in scope, ""White Line Fever"" is fun simply because its style and sense of pacing is of the kind that viewers simply will not see anymore.
The Mill Creek DVD is, as others have stated, bare bones, but the picture is not bad and the sound transfer is better than I expected. In summary, if you are an action movie fan, get it. We probably won't see pictures like this one again. B+",1430697600,9,1501,4.754789272030651

6948070,5,B00S1VR5UI,"Not one of your classic films, but if you're into trucker flicks from the 70's and awesome truck action this rates at the top next to the ""cult"" trucker film Duel and the outlaw trucker film Convoy with Kris Kristofferson and Ali McGraw. The Ford W9000 Blue Mule rocks and I sure do like Slim Pickens in this film. The majestic Arizona scenery is also worth viewing throughout the film. But Duel is by far my all time favorite with Dennis Weaver.",1429833600,14,446,4.451219512195122

Friends know my love of Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, Duel and other classics and had strongly recommended this flick. About halfway through the movie, you might realize it is sort of boring and not very well made. There are a few decent action sequences but not much and the plot is very weak.

The Blue Mule is a nice vehicle to look at but doesn't provide the excitement that word of mouth attributes to this movie.",1519516800,,491,4.579545454545454
