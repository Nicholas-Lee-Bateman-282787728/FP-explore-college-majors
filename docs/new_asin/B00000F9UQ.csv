8489611,5,B00000F9UQ,"This is exactly how a concert video should be. There's no annoying camera tricks or post-production effects that have ruined so many other releases, (Yes' Keys To Ascension DVD is one that springs to mind!!). The filming puts you on stage with the band, and there's plenty of close ups highlighting Rory and his amazing guitar playing. The band supports Rory brilliantly throughout a selection of his old and new material. One of the highlights for me, is the wonderful solo acoustic version of `Out On The Western Plain'. I highly recommend this video, and really hope it gets released on DVD one day .",1123804800,18,603,4.752380952380952
