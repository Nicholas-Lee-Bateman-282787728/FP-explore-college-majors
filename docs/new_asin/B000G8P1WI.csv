2602832,3,B000G8P1WI,"Overall very interesting with an artist who was very proffessional in his approach to his art. Perhaps a few basic lessons given by him could have added to the enjoyment.
Sincerely Terry",1190160000,5,186,4.84375
2602833,5,B000G8P1WI,"OK, this DVD is more on him and what he has to say about dancing, tips, shows, etc.  Very cool angle, have not seen this and I have seen a lot.  And of course, he's hot and you get to see how Hot if you know what I mean!",1163462400,9,220,3.4693877551020407
8129672,2,B000G8P1WI,it was very informative but I was looking to learn some dance moves.,1408492800,,68,4.3076923076923075
8129673,5,B000G8P1WI,"First male stripper that seems down to earth and has a sense of humor.  Would like to see more of
hims performances.  Video is very helpful in showing how to please a women.  His performance and interaction
with his audience isn't sleazy but makes it seem fun time.  This is from a male viewer.

PS:  he is well endowed but doesn't appear erogant.",1404259200,,347,4.428571428571429
8129674,1,B000G8P1WI,"The dancing is weak, you'd do better watching the film, ""Magic Mike"". Who knew a male stripper could be boring?",1357257600,4,111,4.6
8129675,2,B000G8P1WI,"It is probably not a bad informational if you are looking into becoming a stripper, however if you are looking for dance moves or ideas for your woman or women it is almost completely devoid of such tips, and no real technique for clothes removal either, so again unless you want to learn about the industry and get some basic tips on becoming a stripper don't get this dvd",1331078400,5,373,4.420289855072464
8129676,5,B000G8P1WI,"A very informative DVD about male Stripping ,his show and his hints are very helpfull. Worth buying if your interested in the buisness !",1303516800,,136,4.708333333333333
8129677,1,B000G8P1WI,"I bought this DVD expecting to get some moves and tips on dancing, but all you get is a few interviews with Jax Steele (a stripper). The interviews are really just information on how to get started in the business, which you could always just Google. There are two dances in it, one he does for his girlfriend and the other is like a bachelorette party or something. The only somewhat decent advice he gives is to respond to your clients, which is a given. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you have extra money to spend and want a 10 second shot of him flapping his penis around.",1277424000,13,586,4.385321100917431
8129678,5,B000G8P1WI,"It's extremely hard to find something on male exotic dancing. I have always just used my guts and follow my inner voice/ideas. Here you can get a nice view of the ""mechanics"" of it all, very nicely produced, it's like giving you the ""backbone"" of it all, you just gotta choose your theme, decide what your strengths are and make it happen!!!",1252108800,,341,4.516129032258065
8129679,1,B000G8P1WI,"THIS IS NOT A DANCE TAPE. I though I was buying a dance tape that would be a fun way to exercise. What this is is a video of the career aspect of male exotic dancing. I find that while their are some demonstrations of his acts, this should probably be a complete idiots guide book to male exotic dancing.",1213056000,3,304,4.083333333333333
8129680,5,B000G8P1WI,"100% worth the purchase. Very good picture quality. Very good sound. Very good tutorial. Guy is fantastic looking and has a great body!

Learned a lot from him!",1212537600,,160,4.714285714285714
8129681,4,B000G8P1WI,"i figured i'd return the favor for the wife learning how to strip for me...and pole dance, lol. she loved it...i kind of felt stupid at first, but then i started to enjoy it. maybe i'm a born dancer! lol. it really has made our love life much more enjoyable and interesting! buy it guys or girls buy for your man! truly fun!",1190851200,3,324,4.158730158730159
