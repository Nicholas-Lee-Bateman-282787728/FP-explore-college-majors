1208928,2,B00000FA6C,"I went into this film hoping for a touch of horror; after all, Barn of the Naked Dead would seem to imply that there are going to be dead people (apparently naked) involved. Well, a handful of people do die, but we don't get to see any kind of gory details of the kills, and, strangely enough, there is no nudity whatsoever to be found here. Normally, that would not be a problem, but the film title promises us naked dead people and fails to deliver any skin whatsoever - that's just not right. There is a barn in the movie, though - I have to give them credit for coming through with that promise. The movie itself is pretty hard to watch. Almost against my better judgment, I'm rounding up and giving the movie two stars just because they did establish a plot and actually followed through on it. A bit of unnecessary silliness at the end did nothing to raise my opinion of the film, though.

What we have here are three young ladies traveling to Las Vegas in order to perform in a show. One of them knows a great shortcut through the desert - you know nothing good is going to come of that. Well, they end up stranded in the middle of the desert overnight; the next morning, though, help arrives in the form of a nice young man who offers to drive them to a phone, etc. But wouldn't you know it? The nice young man is actually a psycho who thinks himself the ring leader of a very special circus - a circus made up of female human ""animals."" He has quite a menagerie already, although he doesn't seem to be training them for much of anything. When they get out of line, he takes the whip to them, and when any one of them proves herself unwilling to be trained, he takes it upon himself to discipline her severely.

I have certainly seen worse exploitation films than this one, but that doesn't make Barn of the Naked Dead a good movie. While the acting of Andrew Prine as the insane ring master is actually quite good, a significant number of roles went to actors and actresses of less impressive quality. The print of this film is also very bad. The colors are the polar opposite of vibrant; this film could deteriorate horrendously in the coming years without anyone even being able to notice. I didn't care for the ending, as it introduced an element that robbed the film of the bit of effectiveness it had managed to generate, yet there is a story here that holds together and makes sense - and that keeps it from being a truly bad movie.",1127606400,,2447,4.328976034858388

7907905,5,B00000FA6C,Love this movie . If for nothing more then the cover art . But well worth the money.,1483315200,,84,3.7222222222222223
7907906,5,B00000FA6C,"A ridiculous movie, but for all that it is has a camp appeal.  Besides, I am featured in it, so I have to like it.",1418601600,,114,3.56
7907907,1,B00000FA6C,"I can't understand how any reviews of this.... film can be positive. It is stupid, stupid and more stupid. It was an insult to my sensibility to even try and watch this film. this is a masochistic film that I am sure that only the stupid will enjoy. I see nothing classic about it. Twelve women are held hostage by a 'handsome' psycho and are set to be killed in 'his circus'. Come on; get real. How dumb is this plot?
Not to mention that the film quality is of VHS quality. Overall, a very dumb film about subjugating women. Personally, for me I couldn't stand it.",1382140800,,565,4.289719626168225
7907908,5,B00000FA6C,"What a treat to finally be able to see this. It is jam packed with extras with a great on screen interview with Andrew Prine. There are also interviews with Fred Olen Ray among others. Not really much nudity as the title implies, put plenty of moody atmosphere in the barn itself and a few twists and turns throughout. Nice print considering it has been out of circulation for over thirty five years.",1261612800,4,400,4.493150684931507
7907909,4,B00000FA6C,"While by no means perfect, this is the best way to see this incredibly obscure grindhouse horror pic. The mastering is not the greatest, but it looks far superior to a VHS and is obviously not from a videotape. Andrew Prine as usual delivers in the demented protagonist department. If you ever saw his deranged performance in either CENTERFOLD GIRLS or SIMON KING OF THE WITCHES, you'll know what awaits you here. Okay, so the girls are never totally naked -- or at least naked when they're dead, but who cares if the title literally represents the content of the movie? Since when has that ever been a criteria for a drive-in/grindhouse type movie being entertaining? Prine excels as an insane young man living in the desert who has a whole boatload of female hitchhikers chained up in his barn to do his ringmaster bidding. And  did I mention that he lives a little too close to an old atomic test site? His poor old dad stumbled a bit too far from home one day, got exposed to an overdose of radition and is now a horrible-looking mutant. Great trash. By the way, this is not a bootleg. About five years ago I was toying with the idea of starting up my own DVD video company releasing public domain horror/exploitation films. And I did some research on 20 or 30 titles -- this was one. Along with films like THE SADIST, THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER, THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, et.al. this is definitely no longer under copyright. In fact this one seems as if it may never ever have been copyrighted at all. I was actually going to give this only three stars, but added another star in my rating for just the extras -- there's a great Prine interview moderated by old man of the mountain Johnny Legend and another interview-packed feature called ""Gorebeat"" that's like a video magazine with some pretty funny interviews Johnny Legend did with people like John Landis, Fred Olen Ray, Brian Yuzna and Ray Dennis Steckler. Plenty of value for your hard-earned sheckels!",1204416000,6,1963,4.624641833810888
7907910,1,B00000FA6C,"Ok, I don't care who is putting out what version, all this talk of the film, and the intriguing title, made me want to rent this, and I wasted a rental on this. I can't judge the quality, for the film is NOT 16x9 enhanced, which should be the norm nowadays, nor is it progressively scanned, so the picture played weird on my player. And to top it off NO NAKED DEAD! Just a moron who chains girls up and lives with his monster dad. Very amateur night, so what is the big deal? No naked deads here. Did I miss something?",1201996800,12,518,4.088235294117647
7907911,1,B00000FA6C,Note my original negative review was for the bootleg release by Legend House as it was an unlicensed release that appears to come from a VHS duped and thus it looks awful so don't waste your money on it.  However do buy the official version by Code Red under the TERROR CIRCUS title this one gets 5 stars.  Not sure why this negative review was attached to Code Red's product page which hadn't come out when I wrote this review.,1201824000,16,428,4.3375
7907912,5,B00000FA6C,"I released this DVD and would like to respond to these uninformed, malicious posters. This DVD is NOT mastered from a VHS tape, and it is NOT a bootleg. The quality is good, and it is an absolutely ""legit"" release, and is in no way illegal as this poster has erroneously charged. These comments are made from a group of rather vicious individuals based on unsubstantiated and biased information. The DVD speaks for itself.",1201824000,10,422,4.716216216216216
7907913,1,B00000FA6C,"This disc is not only from a VHS tape, with lots of ghosting and image problems and improperly letterboxed from a fullscreen tape, it is also a bootleg!!! The legit version is coming soon from Code Red from the original negative, so if you buy this terrible illegal release, you are not a true horror fan! Ignore ""Johnny Legend"" and the Andrew Prine interview, you'll get better value if you wait!",1201824000,19,397,4.605633802816901
7907914,5,B00000FA6C,"I've got the old vhs of this movie, and this new dvd release is far superior.  A very watchable and enjoyable little flick!  I love Andrew Prine in this movie, he is so over-the-top insane as a demented desert-rat who kidnaps young women and forces them to perform in his 'circus'.  What really takes this release to a new level is the extras, there is an interview with Mr. Prine who is a very likable guy, and then there's a video magazine called Gore Beat, which is way cool.  There are interviews with John Landis, Fred Olen Ray, Brian Yuzna and Ray Dennis Steckler, plus a lot of clips and trailers from other low-budg horror flicks.  I'd say this is well worth the purchase, and something I'll watch again.",1201824000,7,712,4.488372093023256
