4018773,5,B002ZG996I,"I was in the mood to watch a light-hearted romantic comedy and that is what I got. So girls out there, when you're home alone and very bored, get yourself the movie DVD, keep your ice cream bowl and your chocolate bars at your side and start watching. It's entertaining, predictable but funny and very much a chic flick. J-lo as always dresses well and looks hot even though she plays the role of a mommy-to-be in almost half of the movie and Alex O'Loughlin is a hunk. Don't know about the second half of the movie but in the first half, his character is too good to be true. Obviously, this is 'reel' life, not 'real' life but you so want to believe in it and you do 'coz he's done a fab job at acting, not to mention, he looks gorgeous. I wish life could end up being as perfect as in the film, with marrying the love of your life who happens to be hot, not one but two children when you want(even though you don't have a clue who the father is) with a third on it's way (this time, you know who the father is) and a pet shop of your own. This sure ain't a movie for guys who are into action/ thriller/horror/sci-fi films and all the rest of the boy stuff. Will couples expecting soon like the movie? ummm...not sure!! At least the fathers to be won't. All the cons of having a baby stood out more than the pro's but I guess people are pretty much aware of the ups and downs of parenthood already.",1274572800,5,1400,4.131868131868132
4018774,5,B002ZG996I,"This movie is captivating.  The chemistry between Alex Oloughlin and Jennifer Lopez is outstanding.  It is truly funny.  Jennifer's best performance and Alex is an impressive actor.  You love them as a couple.  It is a well-balanced movie.  Everyone will enjoy it, the girlfriend or wife and the boyfriend or hubbie..",1274140800,4,317,5.117647058823529
4018775,1,B002ZG996I,"Holy perky opening credits batman! I almost stopped watching at this point due to annoying music and color combinations. Overall, I'm not really sure when the characters did what they did in the movie. I didn't understand the gross out moments, like the dog throwing up a pregnancy test and gross fluids at the gyno... yuck. All that I can figure out is that this movie was written for guys. It actually casts women in a pretty negative light and focuses on this random boyfriend's forbearance and tolerance. Gag. Seriously, what guy takes over financial responsibility and slips directly into marriage mode with woman he's been dating for a few months  and is pregnant with another man's child? And yet again, another movie makes me not want to have children. That should make K happy!

The movie starts out on such a traditional note, by presenting all the requisite stereotypes with commonly unique names:
Clive - The gay best friend who is over involved in the friendship
Mona - The high maintenance best friend who is over involved in the friendship
- Don't expect to ever really see these two again
Zoe - The ""every girl"" (though I don't honestly understand how anyone can relate to JLo, she never really gives off an approachable vibe, more of a freaky diva one.)
Stan - The perfect dreamy guy who chases down a random girl he met to make all her dreams come true
A quirky pet - a French Bulldog in a wheel chair
A horrible, horrible soundtrack compiled of music that I hear at my gym
A ridiculous premise possibly resulting in a ginger baby

However, some things were very realistic.
Every guy that I've ever met and then walked home with has grilled me about my first kiss and other girly details.
French bulldogs love to chew on pregnancy tests.
JLo is too thin to properly handle a garden hose.
JLo has to wear giant black framed glasses to drive.
Chili is edible on the stovetop and will not burn you and bread makes an excellent napkin.
Somehow you can ""grow"" and make cheese on a horse farm. Mmmm horse cheese.
Guys like to be punched in the face during sex.
The best time to tell a guy you're pregnant is right after you've had sex.
Parents don't care if their kids eat sand.

Favorite quotes:
I really want to kiss you but it smells like cheese in here.
Unfortunately there weren't any other good ones...

My recommendation: Skip it, or if you have to see it, watch it on TV where it's edited!",1273536000,12,2409,4.528735632183908
4018776,5,B002ZG996I,"I already saw The Back-Up Plan 3 times!! It is funny and very entertaining, Alex and Jennifer have an amazing on screen chemistry!

4018777,5,B002ZG996I,"Real funny movie, one you would really lilke to see again. JLo is always good and Alex O'loughlin had the whole audience laughing.  He really is a scene stealer! I have already signed up to receive this movie when it is released on Amazon.",1272326400,10,239,4.431818181818182
4018778,5,B002ZG996I,I actually saw this movie today and I loved it. It was fun and it made me laugh. I had a great time. I've never been a big JoL fan but I thought she was cute and likeable. Alex O'Laughlin was funny and romantic without being over the top. They had very good chemistry together and the movie was well worth the money I paid to see it. I will buy the DVD when it comes out.,1272067200,19,371,3.831168831168831
4018779,5,B002ZG996I,"The movie puts a nice spin on things happening backwards. The movie is breezily paced, tightly edited and effectively makes use of the Manhattan exteriors.",1272067200,3,155,5.24
4018780,2,B002ZG996I,"""The Back-Up Plan"" is an unbelievably bad movie, an over-the-top and hopelessly strained effort that's about as artificial as the method employed to impregnate Jennifer Lopez's character. Like so many that have come before it, including the cheerless ""Baby Mama,"" it takes a sincere and engaging idea, strips it of anything meaningful, and then jam-packs it with shrill comedy routines, some verbal, some slapstick, all of them completely unnecessary. This isn't to say that it couldn't be made funny, but it does need some degree of truth in it. There isn't a character, a situation, a location, or even a single line of dialogue that feels genuine - the plot is little more than an extended episode of a sitcom, one so hokey and manufactured that, at the end of its thirty-minute timeslot, all has miraculously been resolved.

The plot: Lopez plays Zoe, a New York City pet shop owner who, after years of not finding Mr. Right and starting a family, decides to take matters into her own hands and get herself artificially inseminated. Her simple plan becomes complicated after meeting Stan (Alex O'Loughlin), a handsome dairy farmer who sells his own homemade goat cheeses at farmers markets; the two instantly fall in love, although she has yet to tell him that she has been trying to get pregnant. Once she finally does become pregnant, it takes her even longer to admit it to him. Needless to say, he's more than a little shocked when the truth is finally revealed. Up until now, he had never thought beyond meeting someone and forming a relationship.

The rest of the film is spent on Stan trying to cope with imminent fatherhood, Zoe getting past her deep-seeded trust issues, and both fretting over an uncertain future. In this sense, ""The Back-Up Plan"" is no better than the plethora of romantic comedies released annually, going for all the obvious jokes that have absolutely no basis in reality. Consider a moment early in the film, when Zoe arrives at Stan's farm; as she drives along, she notices that he's helming a tractor without a shirt on, and this distracts her so badly that she plows into a tree. Never mind the fact that we know she's pregnant at this point - for the filmmakers, it's only about the humor in losing control and damaging a car. Perhaps it was one of those situations where it was so funny that I forgot to laugh.

We're also treated to a number of tired, unoriginal pregnancy jokes, which cover everything from spontaneous vomiting to constant food cravings to weight gain to that fateful moment when the water breaks and everyone within range slips and falls. We're also given a few unexpected jokes, such as the sight of blood on the gloved hand of Robert Kline, whose character frequently examines Zoe. Did I miss something here? Is this funny just by virtue of the fact that it's blood? Or is it because, soon after seeing the doctor's hand, Stan dramatically collapses in yet another display of overused pregnancy humor? A scene like this is a deep mystery, begging the question of what audience is expected to find it entertaining.

And then there the women of a single moms club, which Zoe is nearly voted out of simply because Stan has entered her life. They're all little more than broad comic caricatures, displaying not the slightest hint of authenticity, believability, or subtlety. They take part in a waterlogged birthing scene that truly does reach a new level of sheer comic desperation - as the leader bangs on a drum and chants, the mother-to-be sloshes around a plastic swimming pool, moaning as if she were channeling both an orca and a sheep, screaming at Zoe to stay where she is because she's her focal point, ordering Stan to fetch her a mirror so that she can see the baby's head emerging. This is probably the least funny scene of any movie released this year. Or last year. Or the year before that.

I'm still shaking my head in amazement. What were the filmmakers thinking? What were the actors thinking? Who believed that making this was a good idea? ""The Back-Up Plan"" is a movie of astonishingly little depth, plausibility, insight, and humor, although I suspect it might have been halfway amusing as a five-minute variety-show skit. Alas, it's just over 100 minutes, which is to say that every joke is either needlessly stretched out or terribly out of place. The former includes a cameo appearance by Anthony Anderson as a worn out, wisecracking playground dad, who both frightens and inspires Stan, and who doesn't know what to make of the substance his son dug out of the sandbox. The latter includes Zoe's dog, which lost the use of its hind legs and now uses a doggie wheelchair to pull itself along. This might have worked had the poor thing not been a tool for a series of shallow I-want-to-eat-people-food-and-chew-on-your-pregnancy-test gags. The only back-up plan this movie should have followed was not getting made.",1271980800,3,4897,4.804270462633452
4018781,5,B002ZG996I,"I have seen The Back-Up Plan three times and I have the DVD on preorder.  I am a fan of Alex O'Loughlin, and as always, he does not disappoint.  This film is charming, funny and at times very touching.  I never have been a fan of Jennifer Lopez or what may be called ""romantic comedies"", but in this film I actually enjoyed her and I wouldn't even really consider it just a romantic comedy.  This movie is sexy and would be enjoyed by men and women of all ages. Much of the movie was actually filmed in New York, so you get that cool New York feel of the city.  Having lived in Manhattan for years and loving it, I can't think of a better combination - Alex O'Loughlin and New York City.

I love the way Alex O. does comedy - he doesn't go over the top the way some actors do to the point where it is slapstcik - his style is perfect - realistic and extremely funny at the same time.

The whole cast is wonderful, but I do have to say that one of my favorites was the little dog, Nutsie.  The whole story line about Zoe's pet shop added to the fun of the movie. They even had Cesar Milan, The Dog Whisperer.

If you want to see a movie that is sexy, interesting, modern and funny, buy The Back-Up Plan.  The soundtrack is excellent too, so I bought the CD.  I have played it over and over and I never get tired of the eclectic mix of music.  Try the DVD and the CD - you will be delighted with both.

I have seen all of Alex O'Loughlin's work since the beginning of his career in Australia and it is all fantastic - I can't wait for his next film.",1262736000,3,1547,4.016339869281046

Telling a co-worker about the movie, I said, ""Okay, in most respects it's a typical mediocre-or-worse rom-com, with those awful, tedious soft lighting 'romantic' moments, the misunderstandings, the boring breakups and reconciliations and heartfelt-horrible speeches...BUT, it's also got some of the most hilariously gross, crude, tasteless sequences I've ever or never seen in that ghastly genre of contemporary romantic 'comedy', coming completely out of bizarro lschizoid-world left field. See it!""

I actually don't know if she ever did. And I know that many critics and patrons hated exactly the parts that I think are the only things worthwhile about it. That's their problem.",1514332800,,816,5.580645161290323

4019360,1,B002ZG996I,"OMGosh who wrote all these 4 and 5-star reviews?  I have to disagree.  Maybe J Lo and Alex O'Loughlin fans?
 I love rom coms.  I do.  And I like and admire both of these actors.

But oh wow this was horrible.  So trite, cliched, quick, vapid - the tow had NO, zero, chemistry, no plot building.  One date, then she's at his farm having sex in the 1st 20 minutes.  And then they're bam in love?  It didn't build at all.  And there was no visible reason one could find that they would have feelings for each other at all.  Even the support group was weird, awkward and unpleasant to watch.  The best friend was boring. Anthony Anderson in the park was the best part of the whole movie, fabulous.

You can never forget you're watching J Lo.  J Lo is ALWAYS J Lo in this movie.  She wears her boho hippy style outfits, and her hair is too thick and bushy making her look like a doggie from her own character's pet store.  She's gorgeous, but can't she look like the character?  It's like she wore her own clothing for the part and it was taking you out of the movie.",1472083200,,1062,4.173267326732673

4019623,4,B002ZG996I,"(Rounded up from 3-1/2 Stars) By now, Jennifer Lopez is no stranger to rom-coms, and she knows how to make the most of her roles, imperfect as they may be.  Such is the case in ""The Back-up Plan.""  She and Alex O'Loughlin, each attractive actors, thankfully portray attractive characters here as well (not always true in these types of films), and a can't-beat supporting cast that includes Linda Lavin (TV's ""Alice"") and Tom Bosley (TV's ""Happy Days"") should satisfy nostalgic TV fans, too, along with the always dependable Melissa McCarthy (though the few splashes of gross-out humor may have been a bit much).  It's not exactly a show-stopper but has moments of tenderness and laughter that all make it surely worth your time, and it's actually Jen's character's dog, the cutest dog in a movie ever, who steals the film!",1455494400,,823,4.864285714285714

The dog was great and I found it interesting that in reading reviews on here some loved it except for the birthing scenes-to each his own as the birthing scenes were my favorite! The supporting cast made this movie for me and I now have it on my amazon wish list to buy!,1429920000,,363,4.2
4020021,4,B002ZG996I,"This is hilarious - but kind of gross in some spots. I don't think I'd watch it with anyone other than my bestie, or my family.
There are just some things in here that go a little too far; things that men don't really need to know, (and the only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars.) But, the rest of the story is wonderful. It's a very down-to-earth love story that will make you feel good.
It only has one sex scene, (which matters to me) & it's really not even a sex scene; but it IS funny!

I do recommend this story - especially if you're looking for a lighthearted movie that will make you laugh.",1428364800,,606,4.092436974789916

4020362,4,B002ZG996I,"You can decide for yourself, but I think the chemistry between the 2 leads is what saves the movie. Thanks to the male lead, whose face expresses more emotion than most of his words. However, the story was unrealistic and the movie went on just a tad too long. The movie would have been so much better without the birthing scene....and frankly, it could have done without the support group. Also, there were some grotesque displays of human 'reality', which I didn't mind, but do not think was appropriate for the PG rating (should have been 17+). But all in all, the other supporting characters did a good job of tiding the movie over as it were. It's a cute chick flick to add to one's collection (sans the birthing scene). Everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion....no need to insult people's taste over a movie.",1407196800,,819,4.616438356164384

4020406,5,B002ZG996I,I did not know or was aware of who Alex O'loughlin was  until I saw this movie.  Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'loughlin were perfect together in this movie.  Alex O'loughlin truly 'shines' in his role as Stan and made it even romantically enjoyable.  I keep on watching this over and over and since then I watch the his TV show Hawaii Five O.  It would be nice to have another Back Up Plan 2 - in the future.,1403740800,,404,4.128205128205129

4020451,3,B002ZG996I,I am a big fan of Jennifer Lopez.  I love her style and down to earth quality.  She seems to just get more and more beautiful as she gets older but what is up with her movies?  It seems that she gets a great story line and she is gorgeous but the directing or something falls short and you end up critical and disappointed.  I am so sorry to say the same of this movie.  I like both stars of this movie but it just did not work for me.  He was madly in love and then nonsensically critical.  She was adorable but never seemed to really break through.  I can't even pinpoint the exact problem.  It just didn't work.,1400889600,,614,4.05

It comdined a pregnancy movie with romance and normally when movies do this it is bad. But the people who made his movie seemed to know what they were doing. The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because it was good but it wasn't awesome. The plot and characters were good but things kind of went too fast with the romance.,1396656000,,462,4.261363636363637

It just was over the top for me for a PG-13 movie it's has some good acting and a good story line with some twists but just more than I bargained for as far as the intimate details.  I am sure someone else may see this film and it not bother them but it bothered me. I think a PG 16 or 17 or even R would be a better rating.,1396569600,,371,3.6835443037974684

About the last one, so-so Reese W is probably one of the most accomplished actress today, and some of her movies could not have been made by any one else. The movies she choses are not always my taste though. Particularly the funny one.

4021044,1,B002ZG996I,"I normally shy away from giving books, films, and other items on Amazon single-star reviews -- usually I can find at least one redeeming quality in a work, or find something inept/boring/unpleasant without absolutely hating it.  But every once in awhile I happen upon a work that is just so thoroughly unpleasant, so badly handled, and so dreadfully boring that I can't help but give it the lowest rating this website will allow.  These are works that are so bad they're not even good in a ""so bad it's hilarious"" way -- they're genuinely painful to sit through.

""The Back-Up Plan"" is one of those.

Pet store owner Zoe, having given up on the search for Mr. Right, decides that she really wants a baby and gets herself artificially inseminated.  Predictably, shortly after the procedure ""takes,"" she runs into the perfect man -- Stan, a farmer's market merchant who makes and sells his own goat cheese.  The two fall in lust (they never have enough believable chemistry to make me believe they love each other), and only after they've slept together does Zoe reveal her pregnancy (with twins no less).  The rest of the film deals with the antics of a pregnant woman, an inept first-time dad dealing with an upcoming baby that's not even his, and several break-ups and make-ups before the inevitable happily-ever-after ending.

There's so much wrong with this movie.  The script is totally inept, with no memorable lines and the sort of cliche, forced lines you'd expect from a mediocre sitcom.  There are no truly humorous scenes, only awkward or disgusting scenes that the movie desperately tries to force onto the audience as funny.  It's almost as if the film itself is going ""Laugh at this, laugh dangit!""  But is there really humor to be had from Zoe's crippled dog eating her pregnancy test, her scarfing chili straight out of a pot with her hands, her water breaking at a wedding and causing everyone on the dance floor to slip and fall, or her single mom's support group (which is made up of some the most horrible caricatures of lesbians I've ever seen)?

The most horrific example of an awful scene played for laughs -- one that's memorable in a truly bad way -- is when Zoe attends the home birth of a woman from the single mom's group.  I'm not going to lie, this is the scariest birth scene ever recorded to film outside of a science fiction or horror film.  I found myself cringing instead of laughing watching the laboring mother flop around in a kiddie pool of water, howling like a dying whale and screeching orders at everyone around her.  I really can't blame the main character for passing out in the middle of the event.  (Though for added ""humor"" the filmmakers have her faint face-first into the kiddie pool where the woman has just given birth.  Classy.)

When it's not being awful with bad misfire attempts at humor, the film is just boring.  You can pretty much predict every plot point, from the multiple breakups between Zoe and Stan as she deals with her trust issues, to Stan's inevitable rush to the hospital to get there before the babies are born.  The characters are all stereotypes, the two leads are bland and lack chemistry, the dog and babies are little more than living props, and there is not a laugh or a tug at the heartstrings to be had from the whole sordid mess.

If you want a sweet and original (if offbeat) romantic comedy, I recommend ""The Wedding Singer"" or ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" over this.  If you want a comedy that revolves around a pregnancy, I recommend ""Nine Months"" instead.  If you absolutely must watch this film, I recommend having something better on hand to get the awful taste out of your mouth.  Even ""The Room"" is better than this -- it's at least so bad it's hilarious.",1362441600,,3742,4.641881638846738

He was truly endearing and memorable. As a result, I made it a point to get copies of his other tv series like ""Hawaii Five-O - Season 1"" where he currently plays Steve McGarrett (what a transformation - one of the best TV remakes ever), ""Moonlight"" (where he played a vampire) and ""Three Rivers"" where he played a doctor. I also heard that Alex was considered to be the next James Bond. Alex shows his range as an actor since he is adept in romantic comedy, action and drama. I hope that Alex gets to do more leading man roles on the big screen since he has proven with ""Hawaii Five-O"" that he can do action-drama with aplomb and also do dreamy leading man roles in a romantic film like ""Back-Up Plan.""

There were some FUNNY parts - loved the Dad in the park and his sandbox son; stew eating at its most refined (I couldn't stop laughing over that); really nasty over-the-top birthing scenes kind of like a car wreck that you slow down to gawk at (I would not take anyone who is actually planning on getting pregnant especially of the male persuasion - this movie could be very effective birth control).

I loved Nuts, the little wheelchair-strapped dog.  He was a riot - better than some of the human actors.

Melissa McCarthy was a lot overboard as Carol, the head of the single mother's group Zoe attends.

I also liked Linda Lavin as Zoe's grandmother.  I hadn't seen her in anything in a while and she added a nice spark.

Were there some unbelievable parts?  Well, yeah, quite a few.  But this is a comedy not a documentary and bizarre is okay with me.

Alex made a great, gorgeous leading man - he does THE best love scenes with those bedroom eyes OMG.  He also showed his flair for comedy and was a great foil for J-Lo's neurotic character - oozing charm and patience. His scenes with the Dad of three kids playing in the park were really hilarious.  J-Lo's leading men in these romantic comedies (like Ralph Fiennes in Maid in Manhattan) are always beautiful, charming and delightful actors - all of whom make her look good.  This is a wonderful, feel-good movie to watch repeatedly every now and then - mostly to have the absolute indulgence of watching Alex on the big screen.

4021333,4,B002ZG996I,"The Back-Up Plan is actually funny.  Normally I don't particularly care for romantic comedies, but this one... this one is actually fairly amusing.

Even more mysterious that I'd like this movie is that I have a fairly strong dislike of Jennifer Lopez.  Alright, I don't necessarily HATE her (I don't hate anybody) but she's just so... how can I say it... more often than not, she's just not funny to me.  This is a rare example where she is funny, and plays the ""worried/unsure mother"" part perfectly.

It's about Jennifer's character going to a sperm bank to become pregnant.  Then, she meets a guy and falls madly in love with him.  Alright perhaps not ""madly"" in love since they spend quite a bit of time fighting with each other and rarely appear on extremely good terms, but when they *do* share love, it's usually very intimate.

Well it turns out she's not only pregnant, but having twins.  Now, her boyfriend was already reluctant to become a father, and now he's got to worry about *two* babies.  Be glad you're not him because *I* sure as heck am, haha.

It's surprisingly funny though- most of the plotline and the random gags.  The one complaint though, is that they *really* beat the ""suddenly turning away to throw up"" gag into the ground.  That one was used WAY too many times.  I also loved the little dog who walked around with wheels for back legs- he was adorable.

Overall, as someone who normally hates romantic comedies, I can't quite believe how hilarious the Back-Up Plan is.  It's downright surprising.",1313712000,,1528,4.68796992481203
4021334,4,B002ZG996I,"I have to start out by saying that generally, I am not a person who watches romantic comedies. However, now that I'm purposely taking on movies made by the stars of 'Hawaii Five-0' so I can review them for ""Hawaii Five-0 Online,"" I've begun watching lots of movies I may have steered clear of six months ago.

Having said that, I'm seriously beginning to wonder if there are other gems I've been missing considering I avoid certain genres like the plague. I've seen The Back-up Plan twice now, and as a whole, the movie is hysterically funny and heartfelt, with endearing performances by Alex O'Loughlin (Stan) and Jennifer Lopez (Zoe). And you've just got to love Zoe's dog.

After having watched Mr. O'Loughlin for an entire season of a show where he plays nothing short of a bad-ass guy, albeit with a warmth that bleeds through in even his most butt-kicking moments, it was refreshing to see him in a looser comedic role. The chemistry between him and Ms. Lopez is palpable, and his smiles light up the screen right next to hers.

The story itself, and indeed the movie, were absolute perfection...until it hit a certain point, when it kind of fell apart for me. Now, because this isn't your standard movie review - but instead is my gut reaction to the movie itself - the following is a bit unusual for me. But to say I was disappointed at what had so much potential as a pivotal scene later on in the movie is an understatement. I'm going to warn you, the following contains **SPOILERS** so if you don't want to know about the major conflict from the third act of the movie, don't read the next two paragraphs, which are surrounded by **!

**Right after the giving-birth scene in which Zoe faceplants into the small pool and Stan is so completely shell-shocked he can barely form a coherent sentence, is the scene that did it in for me. What happened was that in a movie that was so cleverly crafted up to that point, we were suddenly thrown one of those embarrassing sitcom misunderstanding moments that not only threw me completely out of a movie I had spent the better part of the evening growing to love, but seemed so awfully contrived and out-of-place that it actually made my gut twist.**

**I'm talking about the moment when Zoe decides that because Stan told ""Muffin Girl"" that the babies weren't his, it means he doesn't want to be with her or them, and will leave her at some point using that as his excuse. I have to wonder why the director went with that, because as a writer, I can think of at least half a dozen ways the same scene could have gone without Zoe blowing something out of proportion the way you might find a sitcom character doing. In a sitcom, it's fast and funny and (in many cases) deliberately obtuse. In a movie that to this point was such a high-caliber piece of work, it pulled the rug out from under me and made it difficult for me to continue watching...both times.**

Okay, enough spoilers! Once I forced myself past the point mentioned in the paragraphs above, I managed to enjoy the rest of the movie, for the most part...except the parts which referenced the above incident. Linda Lavin was glorious as Zoe's grandmother, and we even got Tom Bosley thrown in for good measure! They were absolutely adorable as a couple.

I would have given this movie hands-down rave reviews up one side and down the other with the full amount of stars I could give if it hadn't been for my point mentioned above. But still and all? You definitely should see this movie. Lopez and O'Loughlin are brilliant together. They are both incredible actors with lots of talent and a gift for making you love their characters.

And for those of you who are die-hard 'Five-0' fans, there's nothing better than seeing the man you watch on TV every week doing something different. O'Loughlin fans the world `round, who've followed him for his entire career, will tell you, ""Eh, we always knew he was that talented.""

I hated the plot. There were several things that were just so out of the blue and ridiculous that I just rolled my eyes and stopped watching for a few minutes. There was a definite lack of realism here. Only once or twice did I laugh because of the actual plot. Everything seems  very much blown out of proportion.

4021341,3,B002ZG996I,"I had a hard time reviewing this one, because there are some good parts and some bad parts. Of course it is overly predictable and cheesy, like every other romantic comedy.  There were definitely some funny parts. Overall, it's entertaining and worth watching. The things I did not like were:
1. The way Stan acted when she told him she was pregnant was kind of silly. He accused her of lying, even though she didn't lie. They had only been on one date, and he's acting like they were some sort of serious couple.
2. At first I was happy that they were going to show a natural home birth (you don't see that very often in movies), but that was ruined by the fact that the whole thing was portrayed as some sort of hippie ceremony. Everyone was freaking out and basically overreacting to the situation, playing the drums, singing, and screaming. And of course, they had to put the part in there about the bowel movement, but they probably wouldn't have done that if it had been a typical hospital birth (anything for laughs I guess). The worst part of all was the reaction of Zoe and Stan. Zoe freaks out and acts completely immature and childish, as if seeing childbirth is some sort of scary disgusting thing. Stan acts like he is traumatized and comments that he ""never wants to see that ever again.""
Seriously? I saw 2 births by the time I was 16. Do the producers of this movie really think people are that immature?
3. After they broke up and Zoe goes to talk to him, Stan goes on and on about how she ""broke his heart."" Come on! They had only been broken up for a day or two, and he acted like he had been sitting at home sobbing for months.
4. They just *had* to incorporate Jennifer's Lopez's butt into the storyline.
5. There is a scene where her friend says something like ""you don't even want to know what pregnancy does to your bladder."" And then proceeds to laugh and say she ""just peed a little."" It seems like they were trying to incorporate ""pregnancy humor"" into the movie without getting too graphic, but anyone with any knowledge of it knows that this has nothing to do with the bladder. It is has to do with pressure on the pelvic floor muscles, and during and after pregnancy these muscles can be strengthened to prevent bladder leakage. Not extremely significant, but noticeable that they included wrong information in the movie.

I don't particularly like Jennifer Lopez so I didn't have high hopes for this movie. It is funny and entertaining if you are just looking for a movie to watch, but don't count on it being great.",1306800000,,2547,4.463519313304721

4021394,1,B002ZG996I,"I was slacked jawed after sitting through this entire movie.  The basic premise was weak and more than a little far fetched - Jennifer Lopez's character decides she can't wait anymore for Mr. Right and wants a baby NOW!  Then after her first try attempt at a sperm bank... she meets Mr. Right and the sparks fly.  Turns out her first attempt was more than successful - she's pregnant with twins.  Mr. Right decides he doesn't care that she's pregnant and pursues her anyway.  (Insert requisite ups/downs/breakups/etc until the required happy ending.)  On paper is doesn't look too horrible.  So what's the problem?

The heroine has no redeeming qualities.  None.  She's whiny, neurotic, controlling and spends much of the time trying to push the hero away because of a childhood trauma.  I don't see how any guy would want to be around her for long once they got past her looks.

One the other hand the male lead is beyond saintly.  He's funny and charming.  He runs a successful business and going back to school to improve himself.  And willing to go into a new relationship with a woman who just got pregnant with twins (that aren't his).  On top of this, he puts up with and embraces all her neurosis and keeps coming back for more as she pushes him away throughout the movie.

4021397,4,B002ZG996I,"I only give this movie four stars because of Alex O - who I could watch read the phone book he is that gorgeous and charismatic. However what is he doing? Seriously the man can act! Watch Mary Bryant or Oyster Farmer or his turn on The Shield. Yet he is doing stuff like this! It kind of makes me sad.

I give it four stars because he is as gorgeous as you can get in it and funny too but the rest of it! The birthing pool scene was gross. I really hope that he has a plan - a back up plan ha ha - so that he can take all the money from these sorts of misfires and put it towards his production company and make some interesting stuff. I have not doubt he really could be amazing but I remember once in an interview him saying he was only mediocre or some such. Perhaps a lack of confidence is why he is doing this sort of thing instead of holding out for something better? Or maybe an actor has to take what he/she can get in the hard faced world of Hollywood?

I actually think Alex could have a career like Johnny Depp if he wanted - playing off key different roles where his perfect looks don't pigeon hole him. Because he really does seem to have some real depth to him.

As for J-Lo I am not her biggest fan but I don't dislike her either. I quite liked the Wedding Planner for cheesey fun. And I really enjoyed Enough - like a top notch True Movie that film was. But again she isn't on top form here and as her top form is only okay it drags the film down.

I really wanted to love this and I didn't and I just keep getting flashbacks to the earlier work of Alex O and hoping he goes back to his roots at some point.",1298592000,,1623,3.9240121580547114
4021398,2,B002ZG996I,"Starring Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin in what turned out to be a very disappointing film. Zoe (J-Lo) is a strong capable single woman with babies on her mind. However, her efforts to nab a respectable man with whom to make these babies, has been unsuccessful.  Deciding she can do it alone, Zoe gets artificially inseminated.  But wouldn't ya know right after the procedure, she meets Stan (Alex O'Loughlin), the man of her dreams.

Now really, none of this is all that far-fetched. Plenty of women are going it alone, so the premise of the film was fine.  The problem was the execution.  Jennifer was cute and silly, and Alex was handsome and sweet, but together they were not so believably compatible.

I typically look for the good in movies before trashing them for what's bad, only in this case, the bad was so bad, that I couldn't even see passed it to find the good. Sigh~ it's so disappointing because I really wanted to like this movie.  Aside from the lack of chemistry between the two leads, there was the lack of chemistry with her best friend Mona (Michaela Watkins).  In fact, that whole best friend character was horrible.  She was a constant source of negativity-all the time.  I'm sure her snide comments and crude behaviors were supposed to be executed in a funny way, however Michaela's redundant style of comedy was boring and So. Not. Funny.  Everything she did was specifically to get a laugh and got nothing.  Her comedy was too forced, with gags done a million times before, and better.

Which brings me to another problem I had with this film, why was every Mother or mother-to-be in this movie portrayed so horribly?!?  The single mothers are made out to be loopy buffoons with outlandish ideals on motherhood; I already mentioned Mona the best friend and her hateful personality - the only normal female was Zoe - until her ""symptoms"" of Pregnancy turned her into an idiot slob with no manners. They were all so unappealing that the attempt to give them redeeming qualities was too little, too late.

I am a big Alex O'Loughlin fan.  Loved him in the TV show Three Rivers and currently in Hawaii 5-0 and so I enjoyed him in this movie.  Not so sure I like his character throughout the movie but as a romantic comedy fan it all worked out in the end.  And, I was so relieved he had no body tatoos as he does in Hawaii 5-0. J Lo is good and the supporting cast is fantastic. Be sure to watch the credits for outtakes.  And to hear Alex speak in his native tongue watch the special feature of the making of the movie where he is interviewed.

4021455,2,B002ZG996I,"I am seriously wondering if there was some kind of nepotism or bribery of sorts involved in getting this script produced. Seriously. It is absolute garbage. The whole premise is insulting to the viewers and unrealistic. Now don't get me wrong, I am not uptight and against chick-flicks and good hearted, feel-good movies - I actually do like them - but this was seriously pushing even my limits.

So this woman (J. Lo) decides to use a turkey baster to have a baby. On the same day she just so happens to meet her dream man who likes her and wants her, no matter what (after she spent nearly 40 years not able to find at least one person to give her th time of day?). Anyway, she falls for him, we don't really know why - I guess it said so in the script so it must be true - but realizes that she is going to have a baby. So she tells this fool of a man what's going on and he somehow decides that the woman he met like 5 minutes ago is totally worth turning his life upside down for, quitting school and his dreams etc, so he can be the father to HER children and support them. YEAH RIGHT.

First of all, such a scenario is completely far-fetched to the point of BSing the viewers. What man is willing to commit to being a father and family man after only a week of knowing someone? If i met a man who was, I would seriously question their sanity. Secondly, there is no way that in real life someone like J Lo would be single at that age and desperate enough to have to resort to artificial insemination.  That's just not how life works. Sorry.

I give it two stars because the comedy was decent, as well as the lesbian self-help group (despite grotesque clichs of lesbians) and i do like JLo, but story and script wise I would say: such movies should give aspirting writers in Hollywood new hope because if crap like this can be produced, so can their stuff which I doubt is worse. It also means that if they do write something terrible, they need not worry, as apparently there is more going into producing a script than quality.",1294444800,,2033,4.245478036175711

Only so-called ""chick-flicks"" are judged this harshly for following the structure of their genre.) I wasn't expecting a masterpiece that would sweep the awards shows.

The only downside for me were the scenes in the support group, particularly the birthing scene.  When I watch the film on DVD I skip through all scenes containing the support group.

While thinking about her toes, those same toes perch in the stirrups in a gynecologist's office as the doctor implants sperm from an anonymous donor. Would any real woman be focused on toenail polish on such a momentous occasion? Well, maybe.

With that, our leading lady plunges into motherhood, despite a failed search for a promising father-candidate. Then, once she's got the mommy thing going on her own, The Right Guy suddenly appears. You can probably imagine the mixups, flareups, and making up that go with the romantic comedy genre, so I can't say there's anything special there. What makes this stand out is the earthy attitude toward the baby-making process, including a hilarious scene that turns delivery (not J. Lo's) into a team sport. The single mother's support group and especially its ever-so-earnest organizer offer amusing stereotypes to work with, as well.

On the whole, I found it a funny, affectionate, and very forgettable bit of amusement.

Lopez wasn't her best, I agree.  She seemed to be floating throughout the story with no real depth, but that's probably because the movie wasn't real deep either.  $3.99 on demand was a fair price for a few hours.

Thank the lord for Redbox because I would have been seeking someone's head on a platter for making me spend more than a dollar on this disaster.

Examples are a good way to support someone's opinion of a movie, so I will gladly offer up a few.  Okay, the dog who ambles around on a cart for his back legs - stupid, pointless, distracting and it served no purpose to the story.  Although I found the part about it wanting to grab main character Zoe's just used pregnancy test like a bone, swallow the part that indicates the result, then later vomit it up (with a nice close up of the vomit) believable.  Oh wait - no I didn't.

The single mothers support group.  Everything about them was super way over the top annoying, and not in a good way.  I'm not going to waste time typing about these characters; other than to say if ever there was a time for a crazed gunman to enter a room and start firing at random, any time that support group would have appeared on screen would have been perfect.

The first date dinner in that courtyard.  Stan had to walk to Zoe's house, wait for her to fight with her dog to the get pregnancy test out of the dog's mouth, get ready, then walk down to wherever that courtyard was.  How was the place all arranged neatly and organized, food ready, candles lit on the table, and all of that perfectly intact in the time for all of the above to happen without interference from anybody else in all of New York?  Exactly how long am I supposed to suspend my belief with a movie?

Transportation - Zoe and Stan spent the whole movie walking, taking taxis (how they met) or subways around town, so the thought was that neither of them had vehicles of their own.  Okay, I'm with you; it's New York, so I get that.  But when Zoe accepted the invitation to Stan's farm, she rode out in this nice Ford Explorer.  But you never saw that vehicle again throughout the rest of the movie!!

I was on board with the premise of this movie; however it was excuted horribly.  I'm not going to harp on inconsistencies (do the main characters ever WORK?  Isn't J-Lo Hispanic, yet Linda Lavin (from the 70s t.v. show ""Alice"") and a pitifully frail looking Howard Cunningham from ""Happy Days"" are her grandparents, and her Mom character in the movie is also white?  Why doesn't Stan think about selling that farm in rural upstate New York when he says he won't be able to contribute with taking care of Zoe's babies?).

If there was one bright spot about this movie, it was the Dad character Stan met, and apparently made friends with, in the scenes at the park.  He was very funny in telling Stan what he was in for when it came to being a parent and his outlook on kids.  And instead of commiserating over beers, he whips out two juice boxes.  Cute.

I will admit that I have seen decent ""chick flick movies"" (""My Best Friend's Wedding"" comes to mind).  But this one is why ""chick flick"" movies have such a bad reputation.  Avoid this at all costs...unless you don't mind watching someone faint inside of an inflatable baby pool filled with water where someone had just taken a dump AND given birth.

I realize that it is a romantic comedy with slapstick ways which produced a few crude but hilarious moments.  However, as a ""romantic comedy"" there were raucus moments that in my opinion were too disgusting for the genre.  The whole single mother's club giving birth to a baby in the pool scene was almost enough for me to stop watching the movie.  It was that disgusting! What were the writers thinking?

Seriously, though, this movie takes today's realities regarding dating and parenting and proposes a ""solution"" that potentially removes the father from families.

The glorification of single motherhood and the removal of fathers from the ""family"" (due to irresponsibility of their own, the mother, and/or the current ""family court"" system) are huge problems in America today.  What we need is a society that values men's role in children's lives, and encourages preservation of families--to include the father/husband.

In this case I wish they would have because at least then I wouldn't have had to watch as well as listen to this horrible movie. I kept fast forwarding to try & find a part that was better. It was consistently bad throughout. I have seen both of these actors do some good work. What happened here? I didn't think Alex O'Loughlin was far enough along in his career to walk through a performance. I really enjoyed Moonlight and he was one of the leads in that.

There were parts that were meant to be funny but were utterly rediculous. The romance part was absolutely unbelievable, and on a scale of 1-10, chemistry was about zero.

It's hard to believe that a pet shop owner could live in such a great home with tons of clothes and shoes and plenty of time off.  It's also straining credibility that a man could fall so hard and fast for a pregnant woman.

Keep people happy, keep the economy going, and distract us with the same formulas. I am one of those people that do not mind watching these movies yet I think of how many hours were wasted saying ""stay in the car"" or ""don't do that"". It is possible that, someone familiar with that sort of the genre may be able to discern between a three-star in a five-star version depending on the type of acting in the subtleness of the story. However, for me this just looks like another of a long chain the situation comedies with boy and girl misunderstanding each other until they understand each other and would have been better off misunderstanding each other.

However, sit back and enjoy the twists and turns as Stan and Zoe (Alex O'Loughlin and Jennifer Lopez) anticipate and observe parenthood.

But, I'm honestly surprised at how many good reviews this movie has gotten on Amazon.  It was panned by movie critics and was short lived in the theaters.

Sure, there are some cute aspects to this dvd and a few chuckle moments. However, there were also one too many gross-out moments (ob-gyn's office... enough said). But the story and dialogue were horrible.  The leading male was so bad that even Anthony Anderson couldn't help his acting seem better by comparison!  The movie heavily relied on its supporting cast Albert Klein, Tom Bosley, Linda Lavin, Melissa McCarthy, etc.  It was very obvious that Lopez also (unsuccessfully) relied on her own motherhood experiences.

This movie was scripted a little too much like Diane Keaton's Baby Boom (1987): [ex]career woman, cute guy who lives on a farm, hilarious baby antics, etc.  If 'The Back-up Plan' had been billed as a remake, then maybe I'd have given it more slack.  But after watching this dvd, and then following it up with the MUCH superior 'The Wedding Planner' and 'Maid in Manhattan,' it's obvious that this latest movie was NOT a labor of love.",1283472000,,1255,4.882075471698113

Throughout the day, they keep running into each other, and slowly begin to fall in love. After they start a relationship, Zoe finds it hard to tell Stan that she is pregnant.

I watched this last night after coming home from a weekend trip.

It was under 2 hours which always make me weary as I worry there isn't much substance to the story and/or it's rushed.

**Spoilers**

The movie seemed to be in fast forward as the trailer showed most of the funny scenes already. For those who aren't familiar with the plot; Jennifer's character decides she wants to have a baby.. by any means possible. She goes to the clinic and magically is pregnant on the first attempt. Within 20 mins or so, she is pregnant and has to tell her new beau as she is having morning sickness at all hours of the day.

In typical rom-com style, he stays and they try to make it work. Then they have a row and split. But by the end, they are back together.

The only parts that I really found to be realistic or funny were when she had issues fitting into her clothing and feeling fat. The rest seemed very ""movie magic.""

She was a business owner yet didn't seem to ever be ""at"" work.. she didn't seem worried about suddenly having to support twins. Time also elapsed quickly as they resolved all their issues within the hour and 45 min run time.

It's a movie you can watch and chuckle on in the background but not one to keep you riveted or have any depth to it.",1283126400,,1368,4.234615384615385

It is a pity too many cuts were made which make the story feel choppy and the time line strange.

I think the movie introduced too many characters so by the end of the movie you're wondering what happened to x,y, and z. I was so unattached to the Jennifer Lopez character that I had to ask my husband what her name was again at the end of the movie.

Be prepared to be traumatized- especially if you're a man, or a child, or perhaps even the family dog. The scene where her (Zoe- Jennifer Lopez) single mother's group meets for a friend's at-home birth is quite disturbing. It had potential to be a memorable hilarious scene in cinema, but went entirely overboard into the twilight zone. My husband couldn't watch the scene at all. By the time it was over, my mouth hung open, and I wanted to take a shower to wash the disgust off. The dear friend who recommended this movie will be harshly rewarded.

At the end of the day- what makes a good movie might be that you would purchase it or at least watch it again. I would let this movie rot on its lonely warehouse shelf.",1282953600,2,1139,4.388625592417061

So she gets herself artificially inseminated only to meet Stan (O'Loughlin), an organic cheese maker, the same day.  Zoe keeps her pregnancy a secret but makes Stan's life miserable because she's paranoid he'll leave her.  You know the rest.  He finds out.  He gets upset.  They part.  They reunite and live happily ever after.

There is absolutely no wit or intelligence within miles of this picture.  Lopez looks beautiful, as always, but it takes more than a curvy body to make a movie.  Bonus extras include an interview with Jennifer Lopez and ""a bouncing bundle of hilarious deleted scenes,"" as stated on the DVD case.  Yawn.",1282780800,13,1111,4.713541666666667

4022074,3,B002ZG996I,"And how is THE BACK UP PLAN exactly what you'd expect? Well to start with it falls into the category of current ideology romantic comedy. Comedian Whitney Cummings summed it up nicely in her recent Comedy Channel special when she described current romantic comedies as setting the bar high for women's views on romance with stories that will absolutely never happen in real life. It seems to be what all romantic comedies are like these days, so why should this one be any different?

Jennifer Lopez stars as Zoe, a young career woman who owns her own pet store in New York City. Zoe has decided that with no man in her life and wanting to start a family, its time for her back up plan: artificial insemination. A few gynecology jokes later and she's done.

Happy as a lark and hoping for the best, she jumps in a cab only to find another occupant, Stan (Alex O'Loughlin). Both claiming the cab is theirs, they exit at the same time trying to out nice the other and resulting in both walking in the rain. A chance encounter a few days later at the open air market where Stan sells his own cheese and they two take an interest in one another. Showing up at Zoe's store to hear the Dog Whisperer speak seals the deal.

The two become a couple and as their first date is about to begin, Zoe takes a pregnancy test to discover that tah dah, she is indeed pregnant. Forget that it usually doesn't happen the first time around, she's ready to go. Instead of talking about it, she sees Stan and they pair end up falling madly in love. Wanting to make sure of herself she agrees to a weekend at Stan's farm where the two hit the sheets...or in this case a table in the barn...after which she tells him of her condition.

As in most romantic comedies, this leads to a back and forth of acceptance and denial from one party or the other. At first Stan is upset then decides yes, he can deal with this. But then Zoe heads back to New York thinking it will never work. But after several days they reunite and begin their life together.

The problem is that Zoe has trust issues since her father left her family after her mother was diagnosed with an illness that killed her. Stan may be that perfect someone, but she isn't willing to believe that that person exist. Stan, on the other hand, is the one dealing with the reality of children, the costs involved, having to change his lifestyle, etc. As I said, they go into an up and down relationship where they're together, then apart, then together again. Face it folks, by the last reel these two are gonna be a couple.

So there is no real mystery in this film. It's a romantic comedy so there will be no sad moment of losing the babies, nor will the pair split apart forever. Instead they will live happily ever after.

So what's wrong with that? Absolutely nothing. This is not cinematic art in high gear here folks. This is a nice little piece of fluff designed to do nothing more than entertain. And it does that quite well. The lead couple is engaging, attractive and playing roles that have them not look for some deep seated love but more along the lines of romantic comedy fall in love at first sight and know it will last forever kind of love. And in movies there's nothing wrong with that. Even more so when it offers entertainment.

Lopez has been off camera for a while but she hasn't lost a thing. She still makes her roles believable and comes across as a good hearted soul here who has been burned far too many times. Her character doesn't linger on that, but it's always a subtext there beneath her exterior. O'Loughlin (who I'm honestly not real familiar with but have read he will star as Steve McGarrett in the new HAWAII FIVE-OH series) seems like a nice guy and a solid actor, never investing deep rooted emotional depth here because it's not needed. Instead he's a nice guy trying to do the right thing.

The production values of the film are great. The sets, scenery, script and more make for an enjoyable film. Perhaps this movie would have been terrible had I paid for two $7 tickets to see it in a theater. But a dollar rental or even a $3 rental for this movie will provide you with a nice piece of entertainment.",1282780800,6,4180,4.390180878552972

These are films that deserve four to five stars. But this trash? No!! I just wish people just didn't throw so many stars at movies that even at their best would merit a two and a half to three star earning. Anywho.
  This movie is the basic romantic comedy to an extent. Boy meets girl-she at first doesn't like him-he in turn is smitten beyond belief.

Yeah she is single and supposedly hasn't met ""the one"" yet so she decided to be a parent all by herself. They go on first date and well do I need to go on?

The guy love interest gets upset when he finds out she is pregnant and acts weird and basically shows all the signs that he is not okay with it. Yet even though he is apparently not wanting to go through with it,this is a movie so you know how it will end. One scene that annoyed me was when she drove out to his farm in the country and besides where she gets into an accident while pregnant-which is supposed to be funny??-she is inside his kitchen and spots a pot of chili and some fresh bread. She kinda looks for a spoon but never even opens a drawer. She just grabs a handful of bread slices and dips the whole thing into the pot-I am not kidding-and starts eating it like she hasn't eaten in weeks! She is shoving this into her mouth and chili is all over her hand and mouth and he walks in behind her with flowers. He sees this and doesn't ask what is wrong with her? No pregnant woman would act this way. I've been pregnant...we aren't starving pigs!!They play on this theme throughout her pregnancy and she is constantly eating. She is eating chicken in bed and attemps to make love with him but he is turned off by a piece of it in her hair. She moves back to her side and sees some chicken under the cover and eats it.

STARRING: Jennifer Lopez, Alex O'Loughlin, Michaela Watkins, Eric Christian Olsen, Anthony Anderson, Noureen DeWulf, Melissa McCarthy, Maribeth Monroe, Robert Klein, Tom Bosley and Linda Lavin

WRITTEN BY: Kate Angelo

DIRECTED BY: Alan Poul

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 23 April 2010
Review Date: 26 May 2010

The Back-up Plan is a fresh and creative new spin on the romantic comedy. Rather than follow the traditional format of boy meets girl, The Back-up Plan mixes things up a bit. That formula is somewhat still in the film, but it's not as painfully redundant as we've seen so many times.

The first shot shows our leading lady Zoe, played by the lovely Jennifer Lopez, being artificially inseminated. Zoe hasn't found Mr. Right and not having a real family of her own growing up; she wants to bare a child with or without him.

As cinematic fate would have it, upon leaving her gynecologist, she finds the guy she's been looking for all her life. They meet by stepping into the same cab, which could be considered cheesy - yes, but - the writer has the story crafted in New York, so this is not at all a stretch.

The man of her dreams is Stan, played by a new face (Alex O'Loughlin). For me he's a cross between Hugh Jackman and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and is instantly likeable. Matthew McConaughey will now have some competition in romantic comedies!

Stan and Zoe hit it off as he is charming and persistent and we are on eggshells wondering how and when he is to find out about Zoe's little gift, when she of course discovers she is pregnant.

I really enjoyed the premise of this film, as I have grown sick of the same old romantic comedy garbage. J Lo is growing as an actress and I'm glad to see her back on the big screen after such a long break from acting; which she took so that she could stay home and raise her twins, which in turn only added to the respect I have for her. She makes Zoe loveable and believable and we are actually invested in her relationship with Stan. Solid performances go a long way in any film and for us to care if the romance lives or dies in a rom-com, is essential.

Even all of The Back-up Plan's side characters are played excellently. Anthony Anderson makes an appearance and steals the show comedy wise. Zoe's two best friends (Michaela Watkins and Eric Christian Olsen) are both crack-ups, as are all of her gal-pals at a women's group she attends. And her aunt played by Linda Lavin is genuine and sweet.

Sure it has a few clich elements like Stan with his shirt off, an over the top birth scene and a few others; but what mainstream film doesn't contain clich moments these days? It still avoided several that most similar films would have dove into, and the vast amount of creativity it produces far exceeds these moments anyway.

I'd like to give a shout-out to my girl J Lo. Having recently gone through a pregnancy with my lady, I have to say that her portrayal of such a feat was among the best I've seen in film. She clearly put on a few pounds for these sequences and she has us laughing at things we can relate to from personal experiences, and we are feeling her pain in others. She really went the extra mile here in both the comedic and dramatic moments in the film, and the film earns equal merit from both.",1276128000,3,3313,4.46523178807947

4022202,5,B002ZG996I,"If you want a sweet, funny, life-affirming, very light, romantic movie escape this is it.  Not realistic, but that's a big part of the charm here. Jennifer Lopez is reliable as usual - engaging with a natural ease and likability. Got ""hooked"" on Alex O'Loughlin when I saw him in the wildly popular TV series ""Moonlight"" (2007-2008) that was unfortunately canceled after the writer's strike that year.  He looks like a big star on his way up - you can't keep your eyes off him when he's on screen.  It's not just that he is handsome but he's a good actor and even within the suspended reality of rom-com, believable as a sweet guy falling in love and doing the best he can. A great supporting cast as well all around - the BFF Mona is hilarious. Will definitely buy the DVD and watch again.",1275609600,5,790,4.43448275862069
4022203,4,B002ZG996I,"So, it's a Rom-Com, park reality at the door and enjoy the cartoon credits at the beginning.

Alex is a staggeringly handsome man, and my following him since the days of Moonlight brought me to watch this film.  He does comedy as well as he does ""angsty Vampire"".  PLUS, sun doesn't bother this buff and cut goat farmer/cheese maker.

I can take small doses of JLo, yet I will say she does her best.  She needs to get some meatier rolls because at 40 (almost 41) she needs to do something other than this lightweight stuff.

Get a bottle of wine, a quart of chunky monkey and enjoy the movie!

I nominate this for the ""Hottest Scene involving a Pillow"" in a PG 13 movie.",1275264000,2,670,4.312
4022204,2,B002ZG996I,"Part of the Jennifer Lopez Comeback Machine, the new film ""The Back-Up Plan"", tries to be a sweet-natured old-fashioned romantic comedy. But it isn't funny enough or interesting enough to provide anything other than a way to pass some time when it eventually begins its endless rotation on Basic Cable.

Zoe (Lopez) owns a small pet boutique in Manhattan. Desperate to have a child and unwilling to wait any longer for Mr. Right, she tries artificial insemination. The day this process ""takes"", she meets Stan (Alex O'Loughlin, the good looking star of two television flops ""Moonlight"" and ""Three Rivers"", he's good looking, but he can't act). Stan is a merchant at the local farmer's market, peddling the cheese he grows on his farm. Seriously. Stan is attracted to Zoe and wants to get to know her.  For some reason, he initially puts her off, so it takes a while, but eventually, she relents and agrees to go on a date. Just as they start to get to know each other, Zoe tells him about the pregnancy. He decides to stick with her, helping her through the process. Hilarity ensues.

Yes, I know. Doesn't sound all that hilarious does it. And that is a large part of the problem with this romantic comedy. Directed by Alan Poul (one of the Executive Producers on HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" and TV's ""Swingtown""), the film tries desperately to make some situations funny. And the desperation shows. When this happens, and it happens too much, the film becomes a tedious exercise.

There were a lot of wrong decisions made in the making of this film. Every time you want to escape into Stan's romantic antics (the first dinner he takes Zoe to is pretty special), the filmmakers almost seem to think they need a laugh and try to make something happen. When it does, it only serves to spoil the moment and worse, it doesn't make you laugh. When Zoe thinks she might have to face life as a single mom, she attends a Single Mom's group. The main joke here seems to be that everyone attending the group seems to be a lesbian couple. The leader very carefully enunciates each of the words in the acronym a few times. This moment seems to go on forever. And Zoe seems to stick with the group to avoid offending anyone. After Stan enters the picture, she gets roped into another meeting and brings Stan along. This scene goes on FOREVER and isn't nearly as funny as everyone involved with the film seems to think it is. Outtakes from this scene play during the credits and both Lopez and O'Loughlin are captured laughing hysterically.

The filmmakers also seem to want to make Lopez into a Caucasian woman. Is there anyone on the planet who doesn't know who Jennifer Lopez is? After spending years looking at her face plastered on the cover of just about every magazine, watching her music videos, seeing her perform on television, watching her movies, I would find it hard pressed to believe anyone wouldn't recognize her on sight. So why try and hide her ethnicity? Her grandmother is played by Linda Lavin (TV's ""Alice) who is about as white as bread. And the filmmakers go to great lengths to hide Lopez's back-end. She is always carrying a big canvas bag that almost always conveniently hangs across her backside. Her clothes are designed to slim her down. They are trying to hide who she is. Will this make her a more respected actress? No, doing some good work will make her a more respected actress. And this film doesn't accomplish that.

Lopez seems to be trying to create a semi-real portrait of a young single woman. But just as she begins to reach anything worth noting, the story gets her involved in some stupid slapstick thing. The slapstick would work if the entire film were funnier and faster-paced. Because it isn't, these moments seem strained. In one, Stan catches Zoe dipping big chunks of bread into a pot of bubbling stew, seemingly unable to control herself. Look at the pretty woman making a fool of herself. There are more scenes like this.

Zoe is a frustrated woman, desperate to have a child. The film opens with Zoe on a gynecologist's chair, her legs in the air. The doctor has just inseminated and she desperately wants this to 'take', so she leaves the office, walking with her legs clamped together. Lopez certainly appears game to try and make this a funny movie, but everything plays out like a bad ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, too long by half.

Alex O'Loughlin? He's good looking... the filmmakers can't wait to get his shirt off... and this is the only reason he continues to get work. He isn't a good actor. Every time his characters have to show an emotion, it seems just too forced, a couple of degrees beyond natural, and this makes every performance seem like a cartoon character.

Michaela Watkins (""Saturday Night Live"" and lots of other TV work) plays Zoe's best friend. You'll recognize the ""best friend"" immediately. If Lopez's Zoe is supposed to be the beautiful, natural woman, desperate for love, Watkins' Mona is the brash-talking, no nonsense, been-there done-that best friend/ comic relief. This character has been done millions of times and usually she is a lot funnier and more interesting.

Linda Lavin plays Zoe's grandma, the woman who raised her. Grandma actually seems like a nice woman, a believable character, but she has so little screen time it is very difficult to get to know her. She lives in a rest home and has a finacee played by Tom Bosley.

Because Zoe is a woman who owns a small shop, she is naturally very busy and the Romantic Comedy Gods dictate that she employ a staff of wacky employees; a sort of comedy Greek chorus, ready and willing to comment and become a part of Zoe's life, but only to generate laughs. That's the promise anyway; the reality is nothing in ""Back-Up"" creates many laughs.

From the ""meet cute"" moment, to the predictable fights, to the predictable friends and the predictable 'wacky situations', everything in ""The Back-Up Plan"" is, well... predictable.

Generally when a film is this predictable, it needs to be very funny in order to work. ""The Back-Up Plan"" has a few laughs, but it isn't funny enough to override the ongoing sense of dread we have while watching the film. When we realize everything in this film is borrowed from another, we start to fondly remember, longingly remember, back to the funnier, better films that came before Lopez's most recent comeback vehicle.",1275004800,5,6371,4.713387241689128
