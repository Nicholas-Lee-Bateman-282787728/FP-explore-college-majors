8520535,1,B000QU7MD2,"I was a bit disappointed in this one but I should have been warned by the title.  This is a Very basic beginner's introduction to weights.  I did it once and frankly am looking to trade it for something a bit more advanced.  As a regular Firm/Cathe user I should have known better than to get anything with the name ""Basic"" in it.  On the positive side, Lynn is a very comprehensive instructor, caring and concerned that you get all you can from the exercises.  She is perfect in this dvd for someone who is truly new to weights, and uses excellent form in her demonstrations.",1265587200,5,576,4.39622641509434
