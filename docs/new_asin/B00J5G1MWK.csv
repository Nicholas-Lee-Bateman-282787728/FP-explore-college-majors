6333517,4,B00J5G1MWK,"""They're criminals so they aren't gonna call the cops and the cops ain't gonna care if we rip off some wise guys."" Tommy Uva (Pitt) has just been released from prison and wants to start a new a better life with his girlfriend. When the jobs they get don't pay nearly enough Tommy comes up with an idea to get rich quick. After going to the trial for mobster John Gotti he hears of an address and decides to rob a mafia social club. This idea becomes more dangerous when they find out who is is, but when Tommy finds ""the list"" things become worse then he imagined. I'll start be saying that I love mafia movies so I was excited about this one. The fact that this is a true story made me that much more excited. I was not disappointed. The movie does start off a little slow but is a movie that you should keep watching because it is very worth it. You are forced to pick who is the bad guy, the robbers, the mob, or the FBI. On one hand it's hard to root for a robber, but when he robs the ""bad guys"" it doesn't seem so bad. Andy Garcia as the head of the family is pretty likable so you can't totally feel that Tommy and his girl are doing the right thing. To me the fact that all the lines of right and wrong are blurred makes this that much more fun and enjoyable to watch. I would not put this in the same category as Donnie Brasco or any Scorsese movies but this is very much worth seeing and you will not be disappointed. I liked it. Overall, a very good true story/mob movie that is well worth your time. I give it a B+.",1403481600,18,1527,4.026315789473684

6333519,5,B00J5G1MWK,"Wild story made even wilder because it's true.

The standout here is Nina Arianda.  Thankfully, she wasn't forced by direction and dialogue to play a caricature of a stereotype of a clich of a frivolous woman.  Her portrayal is that of a smart, loving, tender and kickass lady, and I can't wait to see her again more roles.  Michael Pitt did a great job as the broken-yet-ambitious young man and he also was a producer of the film.  Andy Garcia is positively magnetically delicious; getting more beautiful and more cool as the years pass.

After watching, Google the real-life names of this couple and you'll be very surprised at how quick all these unbelievably true events went down.

Were they heroes or no better than the mob themselves?  Probably a lot of both.

Really enjoyed the ride with this film.",1402876800,4,807,4.707142857142857

6333522,4,B00J5G1MWK,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**

ROB THE MOB, directed by Raymond De Felitta, is based on a true story about just that: robbing the Mob.

The action is set in the early 1990s during the high profile trial of Mob boss John Gotti.

A young couple, Michael Pitt and Nina Arianda, neither the sharpest knife in the drawer, decide to hold up several Mob-operated social clubs. Pitt, an ex-con, had attended several days of the Gotti trial, learning from testimony that these social clubs are gun-free, and he figures that the membership will not report the crimes against them to the police.  However, in one of these comically incompetent robberies, the modern day Bonnie and Clyde unwittingly get their hands on a secret list of every mobster in the New York family, and now both the Mob and the Feds, who have been bugging these social clubs all along, want that list.

ROB THE MOB is an intriguing, quite entertaining film, played with much humor.  Unfortunately, one senses from the beginning that all is not going to end well for this young couple that are stupidly amusing, yet are never really sympathetic.

Director De Felitta has assembled a fine cast for this gritty comic drama that is enhanced by a good recreating of an earlier time and place.  Aside from Pitt and Ms. Arianda, both of who are terrific, the players include Andy Garcia (as the head Mob boss), Ray Romano (as an investigative reporter), plus Burt Young, Frank Whaley and Cathy Moriarty.

The Blu-Ray disc from Millennium Entertainment includes audio commentary from De Felitta and three deleted scenes.

His girlfriend Rosie (Nina Arianda) helps him gain vengeance as he robs them and sometimes taking their pants for added embarrassment. Based on a true story set in the early 1990's our likeable couple gathered information from the Gotti trial and used it to exploit the mob.

Billed as the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" of NYC, Nina Arianda played a delightful Bonnie as Pitt provided a moody Clyde. It is an interesting crime film, low on the action scale.

6333524,4,B00J5G1MWK,"""Rob the Mob"" (2014 release; 104 min.) brings the story (""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning) of Rosie and Tommy, a twenty-something couple. As the movie opens, it is New York 1991, and Deee-Lite's ""Groove Is In the Heart"" is blasting from the screen. Rosie and Tommy are down on their luck, after a flower store robbery goes badly. By the time Tommy gets out of jail 18 months later, Rosie is working at a collection agency, Tommy comes up with another ""brilliant"" idea: as he listens to the mob boss Gotti's trial, he picks up on the fact that at the mob's social clubs, nobody carries a gun. Next thing we know, Rosie and Tommy are holding up one mob social club after another. To tell you more would spoil your experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Raymond De Felitta, the New York indie movie director who also brought us the excellent ""City Island"" some 4-5 years ago. De Felitta does an excellent job recreating what New York was like in the early 90s (not a pretty picture). Second, props also to screenwriter Jonathan Fernandez, whose script is paced nicely, with some sprinkles of much-needed humor, and turning mostly bitter-sweet toward the latter stages of the movie. Third, beside the mob story, the movie also makes some pointed comments about family struggles (Tommy being estranged from his mom and younger brother). Fourth, there are a number of great acting performances, none more so than Nina Arianda (best known for winning a Tony a few years back for the Broadway play ""Venus In Fur"") in the role of Rosie. Interestingly, she plays Rosie as a blonde (we later learn what the real-life Rosie looks like). Michael Pitt (best known for TV's Boardwalk Empire) shines as well as Tommy. Andy Garcia, who also starred in ""City Island"", has a meaty role as ""Big Al"" (one of the mobsters). But look out in particular for Cathy Moriarty (yes, she of ""Raging Bull"" fame) in a small (about 5 min. of screen time) but remarkable role (as Tommy's mom). Last but not least there is Griffin Dunne, the always upbeat collection agency owner who teaches Rosie in dealing with her deadbeat customers that ""a positive spin will always win!"".

""Rob the Mob"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati without any pre-release hype or buzz, I figure this will not play very long so I went to see it right away. Glad I did! ""Rob the Mob"" is a surprisingly strong mob drama with some other family-themed undercurrents. If you are in the mood for something that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Rob the Mob"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theaters or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1399075200,9,2753,4.650924024640657

6333528,5,B00J5G1MWK,"Rob the Mob is the story of the ""behind the scenes"" stuff the brought down the mafia.  When ""the list"" surfaced, the mob took a dive.

If you remember Leonardo DiCapprio in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catch-Me-If-You-Can/dp/B00B6MAE4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catch Me If You Can</a>, this is somewhat like that.  This is a true story that's just too far fetched to believe.  Michael Pitt stars as Tommy Uva, son of a Bronx florist who had been beholding to the mafia.  Tommy grows up with that chip on his shoulder from watching one of the shakedown men slam his dad's head into the hood of a car.  Fast forward years later and Tommy's getting out of jail with his girlfriend Rosie (Nina Arianda) waiting for him at the gate.  The two try to go straight working for a collection agency owned by a former con, Dave Lovell (Griffin Dunne).

Needing money and after watching the mafia trial, Tommy hatches a scheme by which he would rob the ""social clubs,"" fronts for the mafia where money was always available.  After all, he tells Rosie, 'They aren't gonna call the cops.'  After two successful robberies newspaperman Jerry Cardozo (an aged Ray Romano), picks up interest.  Eventually, after reading about themselves in the paper, Rosie calls Jerry and sets up a meet.  The publicity makes her a star and she begins to love it.  Tommy walks by to see the two talking in a diner.  He immediately has a fit but eventually settles in with Jerry.

I began watching it because I had time to kill.  My thoughts were, 'If I finish it, fine.  If not, so what?'  My wife soon joined me and we really took interest in the film.  The characters being real FELT real.  That made for a great movie.  We stopped for dinner but immediately picked it back up after we returned home.

This is an enjoyable movie.  It is rated R and the F-bombs fly.  There's brief sexual situations including one very uncomfortable one in a phonebooth.  Drug use is also briefly evident.  The drug of choice, though, seems to be tobacco from Tommy's ever present smoke hanging off his lower lip.",1455926400,,2110,4.840336134453781

6333531,4,B00J5G1MWK,"1992, small time thugs Thomas and Rosie Uva are tired of knocking over convience stores for peanuts, so one night they come up with an idea, a crazy idea. While scouting locations, Thomas accidentally stumbled upon a mafia owned bar and realized, there's a whole lot of money there and not much protection. For the next year, the duo ripped off the mob without consequence, until they took something that made them both the biggest targets in New York. This is another unbelievably true story, that has been brought to the big screen and the public eye, because of our on-going fascination with organized crime. Mafia movies do so well at the box office, that writers are scrambling to find any story they can turn into a film and it's the audience that has benefited the most. Some people say these movies glorify crime, and maybe they do, but to me, anything Mafia related is just fascinating. Watching these films and hearing these stories, you think how could that have happened? Then you go to Wikipedia and find out it's all true! Rob The Mob is the latest in a bunch of these little known Mafia stories to hit the big screen and it does not disappoint. Who plays a Mafia don better than Andy Garcia? Add to that the intense, Michael Pitt, straight off a successful run in Boardwalk Empire, and you have the makings of a terrific cast. The bottom line, Rob The Mob isn't Goodfellas, but it's a hell of a story, with a cast that's experienced in these types of films. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mafia movie, but if your like me, that doesn't matter much, it's the story and personalities that you're really interested in.",1452470400,,1641,4.585034013605442

The story of a not-too-bright young couple with nothing to lose who decide to, you know, rob the mob, it maintains a delicate balance of humor, tension and romance. The cast is excellent, even Ray Romano. It's nice to see that Michael Pitt has learned that there's more to acting than twitches and making faces, but it's Nina Arianda who strolls away with the picture. It's not a great film. It felt like the true story didn't give them quite enough to work with, so they filled in with some cliches.

6333611,3,B00J5G1MWK,"In the early 90s, two junkies from Ozone Park came up with a lucrative yet extremely dangerous way to make a quick buck: robbing, at gunpoint, Mafia social clubs. They weren't too concerned with the obvious risks involved, being ex cons with little hope for legitimate employment. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see how that eventually turned out. 'Rob the Mob' has an outstanding cast and starts off well. However, it starts getting too comical towards the middle and loses steam fairly quickly after that. The filmmaking becomes too stylish and music video-like when it's not necessary. The story is good enough on it's own and would've best been told in normal fashion. I loved Andy Garcia's Lucky Luciano in 'Hoodlum' but wasn't too impressed with his mob boss portrayal in this one. Michael Pitt is great and Ray Romano is decent as a Jerry Capeci.

Not with a whole lot.  This world always tries to deal harshly with idiots, but this world often forgets that God loves idiots.  And so do we.

We love idiots because they have no harm in them, we know they make the best of friends, we know they will always repay that $10 we lent them last week.  Now These Two are idiots and, yes, the all-pro Michael Pitt portrays an idiot who can't get out of his own way, and the wonderful Ms Arianda the woman who loves him as he loves her.

This little indie movie about a young couple who decide to rob Mafia social clubs in Queens is worth seeing mostly for the strong acting performances by Michael Pitt(Boardwalk Empire), and the actress who plays the devoted ""Bonnie"" role. Suporting roles by Michael Rispolo, Burt Young, etc are strong and entertaining. I had some trouble with the Godfather role played by Andy Garcia. Despite the inventive script, Garcia's Spanish accent comes through, and his performance and make-up are unrealistic and caricatured; My only other beef with the movie was the end which is blurry, & tires to be ""too artistic"" nevertheless, we all know what happenned to these 2 kids who made a very stupid choice.

6333623,4,B00J5G1MWK,"This is a true story, although I do not recall this young couple who ROB THE MOB, in the newspapers.

Then again, back in the day- when this takes place, the papers probably had news on mafia activity so often, it probably didn't stand out much.

Or at least not until the Feds started working hard to bring the families that comprised the mafia, down.

 I plan to research this Bonnie and Clyde couple ( as dubbed by the press) online, to see how close to reality the movie is, because it all seems pretty darn realistic, but also pretty unbelievable if only because of the sheer audacity and madness of this twosome.

It is these two young lovers who ROB THE MOB and don't feel bad about it. Or overly worried.

What is familiar, are the  mob names thrown around in conversation as well as the mafia characters in the movie- so many of these depicted or mentioned, really existed.

This was actually an interesting story and if the movie had a flaw, it was that you didn't get to know the Bonnie and Clyde couple as much as you wanted to.

 All you really know, is they are young, totally in love, and devoted to one another- along with being incredibly crazy( and naive) to mess with the mob.

Stay for the end and start of credits, because you see the photo of the actual young Bonnie and Clyde couple.

Over all, I sat pretty amazed at the total chutzpah this couple had, to rob from the mob.

The gravity of what they are doing, never seems to register with either of them.

And perhaps, that is exactly why they dared to do it.

This is the period in time, when things started to go south( luck wise) for Teflon John Gotti.

All the actors did their roles justice.

 Ray Romano is believable as a reporter/columnist with a conscience.

I wish his role had been developed more.  Just as we get a feel for the kind of guy he is, the movie is starting to draw to a close.

Michael Pitt, who is playing the CLYDE character is noted for his role on *Boardwalk Empire*.

 In this film, he also plays a daring young guy, with more than a touch of crazy and anger issues, much like the character that he also plays on the HBO series.

In  this movie his hair is darker; but you still see those intense eyes and the fearlessness to do what he wants to do,  or what he feels is justified to do....

And some how, in this  movie- just like Boardwalk Empire- you find him likeable.

Basically, just change the time periods and you have the same guy and believe me, that is in no way, a put down to Michael Pitt.

 He fits this part well, but I am looking forward to seeing him in more movies and in different types of roles as he matures.",1405209600,3,2633,4.247983870967742

They are messing with the Devil himself but, are to young or stupid to realize it.  I found myself enjoying this movie much more than some of the Big releases this summer.

6333630,4,B00J5G1MWK,This is a case of a film being driven by the performances and the script.  I say that because I don't  think director Raymond De Felitta achieves a real tone for the material.  It starts in a bouncy comic way and veers off in a made-for-cable documentary tone and the switch in gears doesn't mesh.  De Felitta is probably trying to pay homage to Martin Scorsese but it ends up as a half-hearted attempt.  The strength of the screenplay by Jonathan Fernandez which is rich in detail and characterization is able to overcome these obstacles.  The film is abetted by terrific performances by newcomers Michael Pitt and Nina Arianda who make both a funny and sensuous larcenous duo.  Their sexual chemistry ignites the screen.  The supporting roles are impeccably cast with Andy Garcia a standout as a gentleman mob boss.  It's a shame this film took the straight-to-video route because it has a whole lot more to offer than the standard summer offerings.,1404604800,6,951,4.785276073619632

I'm always let down by films these days because everything is such trash, but the fact that this flew under the radar without any marketing etc was a sign that maybe it really was an awesome film. No one will spend money these days on something that doesn't appeal to the masses, so the fact that this quietly was put in a few theaters and then put on bluray without any exposure seemed like a good thing. It was. This film is way too charming, mature and weird for normal audiences. It's dripping with nuance and heart and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's not a shoot 'em up type of gangster film, it's got more on its mind than that. You really can't go wrong with this film. Please, just buy it.",1404345600,,837,4.172839506172839
6333632,4,B00J5G1MWK,"A couple of years ago a movie called ""Killing Them Softly"" came out. It was about a couple of low-level crooks who hold up a mob-protected card game and after making away with the mafia's money are hunted down by Brad Pitt, a less-than- golden retriever. It was a dark, brutal, and even more surprising, boring, take on something that should have felt more alive, but because it focused on the mob as victims and talked about it for the duration of its running time, it lost its audience. With Obama speeches cut into the narrative, it was obvious that ""Killing Them Softly"" was more interested in conveying a message than delivering a story.

Cut to 2014, when director Raymond De Felitta takes on a true story, similar to ""Killing Them Softly,"" but spins it so that the crooks are the focused-on protagonists. The crooks this time around are Tommy and Rosie, a goofy couple with a rap sheet, who in 1991, after a bit of living on the right side of the law, decide to return to their roots by robbing mob social clubs. Eventually they get the attention of a mob boss and the FBI, who both make things complicated for the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" of the 1990s.

The acting on display here is sensational. Michael Pitt and Nina Arianda are an unforeseen asset to the proceedings because every second they're not on screen is a second lacking life- or at least the criminal zest for it. Their whacked-out relationship is the equivalent of a can of red bull- it's the shot of energy that the typically told ""mafia tale"" needs. Sure they're flawed, but it's like a journalist played by Ray Romano says to an informant in the film, ""I like 'em."" Undoubtedly, you will too. The rest of the cast is equally stellar: Andy Garcia (these kind of movies are in his blood), Cathy Moriarty, Ray Romano, and Michael Rispoli add texture to the grit.

Also aiding ""Rob the Mob"" is a sense of humor. There are times when movies like this can be so overbearing in terms of content (the rise, the fall, the deaths, the court proceedings), you can barely tell the difference between having enjoyed a movie or having merely admired it for its ballsy storytelling. ""Rob the Mob"" is both enjoyable and admirable because its writer (Jonathan Fernandez) and director (De Felitta) know the genre and how to pace it. There's hardly a scene or dialogue wasted on the redundant; everything in this movie adds up to why its so good. Sure, it ends with the typical montage of scenes of people getting booked (some by the law, some by the gun), but it earns it, and that's something that only the best in the genre know how to do.
No, this movie isn't ""Goodfellas,"" nor is it ""The Godfather,"" but it is ""Rob the Mob"" and to me, that's classic all its own.
