3024185,4,B000YA82GA,"When these come out, I can finally do away with all the VHS tapes that I recorded the series on back when it was in cable reruns.

It was on the worst night of the week on CBS, but it set the standard for this type of time manipulation show. It had all the great episodes - like when the cat ran away and led Gary to his predecessor's dying girlfriend. Or the girl who could see the future, and then saw Gary come in and change it.

The show lost something when Fisher Stevens left, and was replaced by Kristy Swanson, but it was finding itself again in the final season.

I look forward to collecting these long awaited DVD season box sets.",1209945600,6,641,4.153225806451613
3024186,5,B000YA82GA,"Oh yes!  One of TV's few quality shows finally makes it to DVD.  Nothing but good memories comes from watching Early Edition.  The action, the drama, and the comedy all add up to this great experience.  The acting is superb with Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights, and People magazine's sexiest man of the year) and my personal favorite Fisher Stevens (Awake, Short Circuit, and TV's Lost).

The writing is first rate. Unlike some shows, you'll never feel like you're watching the same thing.  Every episode is a new story, with twists and turns that epitomize suspense drama.

The running theme of moral dilemmas violently challenges the American media norm.  In each mind-bending episode, ideals are questioned and philosophies are put to the test, rather than Hollywood's preference to throw ethics out the window.

In this way, a smart, hip, and entertaining series can be enjoyed by pleasure seekers and intellectuals alike.",1209686400,5,929,5.099337748344371
3024187,5,B000YA82GA,"I remember when this excellant Show got cancelled. I turned to my TV one Saturday Evening only to be greeted with a Lame Game Show! IMO This was the beginning of TV's Decline, as the years went by more and more Quality TV Shows were taken off the air and replaced with Shoddy ""Reality"", Game and News Shows. I look forward to seeing this fine show once again, this time without all those Inturruptions that have INFESTED Modern TV Programming!",1209340800,14,443,4.55

3024209,4,B000YA82GA,"I actually love this show, uplifting, family friendly, the only problem is once you start watching it you want to see the rest and you can't. They never released anything to DVD after season 2 and you can't find it streaming anywhere. It's like starting to read a book and finding out that half of the pages are blank. It is extremely disappointing, stopped watching halfway through Season 2 when I realized I would get to a season finale with no hope of seeing the storyline resolve in the next season opener.",1460419200,,510,4.554347826086956

3024224,2,B000YA82GA,"Long before Person of Interest topped the ratings, there was a show with a similar premise. It was nothing as sophisticated as Harold's machine, and was constantly facing cancellation, but it too predicted and tried to prevent future crimes.

Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) is an ordinary guy who is down on his luck, when he mysteriously starts receiving a copy of tomorrows newspaper at his door. His best friend, Chuck (Fisher Stevens), wants to use the information to get rich, but Gary has other plans. He wants to use the information to stop crimes from being committed and enters a world he is not at all prepared for.

The show is similar to Person of Interest, but didn't do nearly as well, because the whole thing is hokey. The show is rarely serious and full of very amateurish jokes. Kyle Chandler play a pretty interesting guy, but he's the only believable character. His best friend is an ass, who would be in jail, and his partner is a blind woman. Not to mention there is some weird angle with the stray cat Gary adopts, that doesn't make much sense.

The whole stopping crimes before they happen came about in Minority Report and garnered major success for shows like Person of Interest, but it may have gotten it's start with Early Edition, a show with a terrific premise, that was unfortunately barely watchable.",1453507200,,1328,4.7155172413793105

3024230,5,B000YA82GA,"LOVE, LOVE< LOVEd this show when it was on, and am enjoying it all over again!  Love pretty much everything Kyle Chandler does; wish there were more seasons of this show; it ends rather abruptly, without any resolution.  Must have got cancelled in between seasons...:( however, one of the more endearing things about this show, or I should say 2 endearing things, is the cast of characters, Marissa, of course , and Gary's buddy, Chuck, and yes, even Officer Crump is lovable, but 2 of my very favorites are Gary's parents, William Devane and Tess Harper; they are gems!!  Wish there were more episodes with them...THIS is quality television, and in my opinion, sorely missed in today's tv lineup; LITERALLY.",1443139200,,708,4.883333333333334

3024264,5,B000YA82GA,"I can't believe how long it has taken me to discover this wonderful show!  I remember the title from way back, but guess I always assumed (based on the title) that it was one of those sitcoms centered around people who work in a newsroom (a theme that was popular around that time)--Well, NO--that couldn't be farther from what the show was really about: a man who gets delivery of tomorrow's paper today (brought to him by a sweet cat) & all of the struggles & antics involved when he tries to stop all of the bad things from happening.  Fisher Stevens was good comic relief in an all-around GREAT show unlike any of the sludge made today. I really wish that more than 2 of the 4 seasons were available on DVD (or any on instant). What a shame to lose this treasure from people being able to see it.",1421539200,,800,4.291390728476821

3024268,5,B000YA82GA,"Sort of on the order of Quantum Leap (if you like this show and haven't seen Q.L. you're in for a treat and vice versa). Kyle Chandler (Homefront) is an unemployed....I guess, stock analyst who receives the morning paper a day ahead of time and feels it's his duty to help whoever he sees in the paper that needs help. Sounds like a simplistic plot but it is anything but.
  Great acting (Kyle is always great), great stories and way too short of life span. Two seasons was not enough for this show.
  Highly recommended.",1418601600,,521,4.4526315789473685

3024283,5,B000YA82GA,"This whole series is based on Gary Hobson receiving the daily newspaper a day early. He's always rushing out to rescue someone, whether they appreciate it or not. Nice guys aren't featured enough on television, so it's a treat to have one. The recurring theme of handsome bad boy on other programs gets old.

The Hobson character is charming, witty, committed to the truth, thinks about others, and bases his life on good values. Other regulars spice up the plots, especially Gary's good friend, Chuck Fishman, a cynical guy who admires Gary even while lamenting that the hero doesn't use his early information for personal gain.",1407715200,,629,4.933962264150943

If I remember right the earlier shows were clean. He did sleep around some--rare. He mostly didn't have time for a girlfriend.

Early Edition was a good show in the beginning, but we lost interest in the later seasons.

The DVDs seem ok. There is a minor problem with one disc, but we think it had to do with what the seller did to the cover.

3024329,5,B000YA82GA,This show had the best concept of any show. Finding a way to stop whatever bad that is about to happen. The problems Gary would run up against was what ever you do may have a ripple effect that you can never see coming. It kept me on the edge of my seat for and hour. Never missed it. I really liked how all characters eventualy as the season progressed became a part of Gary's team. The only draw back is we only have 2 seasons out of the 4 to purchase. I'm beginning to look twice when these kind of show are offered as a season to season purchase. I've been fooled before but never more. I will not buy unless the shows are in a complete series form. Because I bought Early Edition only when their were 2 seasons thinking only 2 more to go so they must be planing to make these available But it has been a Very long time and with No hope of season 3 and 4 being put out for purchase. I really don't think the manufacturers care because this practice is becoming more and more the norm. They waste alot of start up money when they do this. But if they would offer a complete series for these shows more would buy hence making for a more happy buyer out hear. I know I would be more apt to buy if they offered programing in it's complete form. These are shows that are no longer in production so making it a complete series would be an easy task. More purchases more profits think about it. I don't buy anything that is older that could be sold as a Complete series and isn't.,1362700800,4,1477,4.096551724137931

It's more than just a show about a guy who receives the paper a day early.  That's just the surface.  At the start of the series, Gary loses his job, his wife and home- essentially his whole life.  But he doesn't complain.  With the paper, he could easily get rich off of gambling or stocks (as his buddy Chuck wants to do).  Instead he uses it for the best.  Basically, Gary Hobson is a man who doesn't complain about how bad he has it, but he spends his days trying to save or make others' lives better.  And that's the beauty of this show that I only understand now.  These days, especially with the current economy, it's easy to complain about how bad we have it.  But it takes a real man to decide to better the lives of others instead.  In our society, Gary Hobson would be termed a has been, a bum.  No- he's a real man (spoiler!!!)... how many of us would give up a woman we loved, just so she could be happy?

One of my favorite parts about the show is the same thing I liked when I was a kid- Chuck's pondering thoughts in the opening and closing of each episode.  Reflections on life- without any preaching.

Other than that- the video quality is great- hard to believe that these scenes were shot in the mid 1990s.  And, it makes you retrospectively look back with fondness on a time not so long ago- a show without sex and violence, and where people weren't tied to their cellphones.",1354579200,9,1608,4.250825082508251

3024383,5,B000YA82GA,"This delightfully original fantasy-drama centers on Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler), a young stockbroker at Chicago's Strauss & Associates, whose wife throws him out on their fourth anniversary.  The next morning the doorstep of his hotel room is graced by an orange cat with a piercing yowl, a motorboat purr, and a copy of the Sun-Times.  But this is no ordinary Sun-Times: it's tomorrow's.  It takes Gary a little while to figure out what he has here, but when he does he realizes that ""this is a powerful tool, not something to mess around with.""  Why it comes to him or how, he doesn't know, but he knows what he has to do.  As Sam Beckett of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-Leap-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JM3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;""puts right what once went wrong,"" so Gary embarks upon a career of putting things right *before* they can go wrong--exposing political corruption and preventing crimes, accidents, traffic jams, family breakups, and other assorted human tragedies, sometimes at the risk of his own life, and mostly on a local scale (though at least once he stops a space-shuttle explosion, once a nuclear meltdown in Russia, and once, in the complex and chilling two-parter ""The Wall,"" he finds himself involved in a planned Presidential assassination), even though his warnings often have people suspecting him of being a meddler, a masher, a crank, or, at best, ""some kind of psychic.""  He's supported (and occasionally hindered) by his best friend Chuck Fishman (Fisher Stevens), a fellow stockbroker and former college roommate, who constantly importunes him for tips on the market, pro sports, or the next lottery winner, by Marissa Clark (Shanesia Davis), a blind receptionist of boundless faith, and by tough 30-year-veteran Detective Lt. Zeke Crumb (Ron Dean) of the Chicago PD, who isn't sure what to make of him but by the end of the season is advising people that they can ""trust"" him.  Chandler's Hobson is somewhat reminiscent of many of James Stewart's parts; he has that same aw-shucks innocence updated with a '90's anger that he was picked for this job without even knowing he was under consideration for it--often he complains bitterly about how ""the Paper"" won't let him have a life, and at least once he tries to reject it, but Cat keeps bringing it all the same.  As the series proceeds we learn more and more about it--how it works, who got it last, what Cat's powers are (and he definitely has some strange ones)--and even Chuck, whom some viewers may find annoying, gets a chance to shine when, in ""The Wall,"" he demonstrates sturdy loyalty and selflessness.  There's also a good share of humor, particularly when Gary's visiting father (William Devane) finds out about the Paper and (as Gary had feared he would) immediately decides he wants to help--and actually shows a flair for the job.  A perfect mix of drama, lighthearted fun, and intriguing unanswered questions makes this a thoroughly enjoyable series that should have lasted longer than it did.",1324684800,,3110,5.2269076305220885

3024421,2,B000YA82GA,"Early Edition is a show about a guy who get tomorrows newspaper, today. As a result he run all over Chicago with his two side kicks, a greedy, unsympathetic stock broker and a wise blind lady and prevents crime and accidents from happening all the while trying to deal with his own complicated life. The show try to be drama but do not really succeed, it tries to be mystery, but do not make it there either. if I was to put it in any category it would be the same as Touched By An Angel and Highway to Heaven but without these show's religious element or magic, but with the same feel good stories. The main character Gary find someone to help and all turn out well in the end.

Now this show have a good premise. A mean who predict the future, but in a bit unusual way, with tomorrows newspaper instead of more common ESP and decides to do something about it and use his gift to help pepole. There are however some huge problems with this show. First of all it is extremely repetitive. Gary saves pepole, Chuck, the stock broker tries to make a quick buck and Marissa the blind lady give sagely advice. It is always the same, again and again and again. Problem, sob story, happy ending. Now another problem is the characters, they are so paper thin. Gary is perfect, he never falls for the temptation to use the newspaper for personal gain, he never sneak in lines, he do not raise his voice, he do not walk on bloody red light. Seriously, nobody is that bloody goody, goody perfect. Then we have Chuck, he is egoistic, only want money and is far more realistic than Gary, but why the hell do these two hang out? And then we have Marissa, she is blind, and wise and give good advice, she is like a poser child for I have a disability but that is okey. The wise blind person, have we not seen this before, far to many times. There are some more regular cast being added in laster seasons. I have only seen season 1, perhaps the show will get better then, but I doubt it. The far best character of the show is the cat. The hundred years old, supernatural pussy who bring Gary the paper, it have personality, the other characters do not. It makes me want to see an entire show with mystery pus and just do away with all the other useless characters.

There is a continuing story in the show, what is the newspaper, who is the cat and so on, but it moves so slowly it is difficult to stay interested in it. When I sit watching this show I think damned, this could have been so good, but it is so boring, where the hell did they go wrong, they have such a great concept! In all fairness Early Edition is not all bad it do provide some scenes that are amusing, and it is fun to watch, now and again. But if you are buying this series as a DVD box set for a marathon, you will get disappointed.

The actors to seam bored when they play this series. I do not know how much more I can say about it. The series have a wonderful premise, but have been executed with not even a hint of creativity, is is a paper thing, drama wannabe supernatural show with to much aspirations and to little guts. Watching an episode now and again is fine, but any more and I want to punch Gary in the nose. I give this show 4 out of 10. Not horrible, but still far from good. Though as I said I have just watched the first season, perhaps I will update this review when I have seen the rest of the series. But I am not hopeful that I will be more amused by that.",1270512000,2,3435,4.154654654654655

3024460,5,B000YA82GA,"After watching too many Stargate episodes, murder mysteries, and spy movies it was a relief to watch a TV series where people weren't dying left and right or constantly in mortal danger.  Although action is exciting, watching so many people get hurt or killed makes me heartsick.  Early Edition, a TV show about a man named Gary who got tomorrow's newspaper every morning, was a TV show with depth, an intelligent plot, character development, and impeccable acting.  Gary's knowledge of the future leads him on many goose chases and puts him in hilarious situations.  I was immediately caught up in Gary's struggles to accept the paper and figure out how to save everyone.  As I watched the series I thought that the premise of knowing the future and saving lives would get old, but it did not.  The screen writers were very creative and put unexpected twists in every episode.  (Personally, I despise predictable plotlines) Not only were the stories captivating, but the acting was delightful.  Kyle Chandler is the perfect actor to portray a man who isn't quite comfortable with being a goody two shoes.  His best friend Chuck is the comic relief whose constant attempts to use the paper to get money kept me laughing the whole way. His other friend Marissa is a sweet reminder of what Gary's conscience is always telling him.
  All in all, an excellent series with delightful dialogue and a smart sense of humor.  This is a series that lifts your spirits.  It has little swearing and no sex scenes, a great choice for family TV.",1226620800,7,1531,4.775665399239544

3024467,5,B000YA82GA,"I watched this show when it was first on the air, and after watching it again on DVD for the first time in years, I was struck by how well it still holds up in this decade.  In fact, if this show was airing right now, I honestly think it would be the best show on television.

To start, the premise is extremely interesting and original: a Chicago man, Gary Hobson, holds the future in his hand: he mysteriously receives tomorrow's newpaper a day early.  He must make many moral decisions as to how he is going to use the paper -  for his advantange, or for other peoples' advantage.  Of course, for those who really appreciate Kyle Chandler's boyish, innocent looks, we already know he's a good guy in this.

Every episode involves stories in the newspaper, mostly tragic, that Gary must try to fix or prevent.  However, such is life, where one thing is often connected to another, be it people or events, and situations are not always what they seem. Many episodes take us through exciting twists and turns, and before we know it, a 40-minute episode is sadly over.

What I love about ""Early Edition"" is its tremendous heart.  I never cry when I watch television and most movies, but I think this show wins in making me tear up with gladness in more than several episodes throughout its four-year run, especially during the first season.  Episodes like ""The Choice,"" where Gary must decide who to save from death, ""Gun,"" which shows the devestating effects of a broken-up family, ""Hoops,"" and ""Faith,"" where a young girl helps Gary reevaluate the kind of faith he puts in his paper, are uplifting and helps us believe in a world that still has hope and goodness in it.  Sounds cliche, but I'll take a show that celebrates the goodness in people over ones that seem to take joy in showing heartache and violence as a result of the evil people do.

Other episodes such as ""His Girl Thursday,"" ""The Wall 1+2,"" ""Psychic,"" ""Phantom at the Opera,"" and ""Love is Blind"" are exciting and at times very intense mysteries that showcase the classic ""Early Edition"" comedy and engaging story lines.  Kyle Chandler as the bumbling, kind-hearted, and adorable Gary Hobson, as well as Fisher Stevens (as best buddy Chuck) and Shanesia Davis (as blind friend Marissa), make ""Early Edition"" one of my favorite series for its high quality stories, humor, performances, and heart-felt messages.",1219449600,6,2376,4.7101449275362315

Each DVD is securely in place and easily accessible, yet the entire box is only the width of a normal DVD.  The only downside to the packaging is that the episode guide is covered up by DVD #1 and DVD #6, so you have to remove those to read the guide, or else open the package wide and pull out the insert to read the guide.  But who wants to read the guide anyway, when the enjoyment here is from playing all the DVDs from beginning to end?  I'd rather be surprised than read the DVD guide ahead of time.  A guide like this is only valuable for identifying favorite episodes to re-watch anyway, as far as I'm concerned.  I say just watch the episodes from the beginning, without looking at the episode guide ahead of time.

As far as the picture and sound quality here goes, it's great.  I was a little surprised that the 6 DVDs are one sided rather than double sided. Although double sided DVDs can have quality problems, so maybe it's best that these are one sided.  There are 23 episodes here, each of about 45 minutes (that's the ""hour"" without commercials), so most of these have a little over 3 hours of content (there are also ""trailers"" for each episode, but I did not watch those).  I thought that putting 3 hours of content on one DVD would result in over-compression, but the picture and sound still are really good.  On my PC if I looked extremely closely I could see an ultra-tiny bit of graininess (most movies I've seen on DVD have this too), but that's extremely minor.  I'm especially happy about the quality given the age of the show, 12 years to put this to DVD. The sound is really good and clear too, which as you recall is important - the famous title music is well preserved here.

As to the show itself, that's been well discussed by others.  I'll just add that this is one of those programs where character development does matter, so it's great to be able to have this from the beginning.  There are a lot of recurring characters throughout the four years of Early Edition.  And don't get too hung up on little things like the date of the newspaper in the pilot vs. the other episodes.  The date of the paper in the pilot episode shows November, while the later episodes refer to Gary getting the paper starting in September.  Apparently the origin of the paper was changed to September to coincide with the first airings of those episodes (i.e. also in September).  So when the pilot episode says ""November"" on the paper, just think ""September"", and it works.  Especially given that the first episode refers to the Chicago Cubs, which would not have been playing in November anyway. Hey it's a tv show, a unique and terrific one.  And I'm very happy with the way these DVDs turned out.  Now if we can get the other three seasons, I'll be even happier.  But even if season 1 is all we get, it's highly enjoyable, so I definitely recommend it.",1214697600,6,3146,4.412478336221837
3024497,5,B000YA82GA,"Finally it is out!  Season One!  I loved this show.  It was one of those shows that it just kept on getting better-and-better as seasons went.  It was a great show to watch with the whole family.

All I can say is.....Bring on some more.",1214438400,4,237,4.177777777777778
3024528,5,B000YA82GA,"I am so glad that this is about to get released - about time.  I loved watching this great show all the time and almost never missed an episode.  I love Kyle Chandler (Gary) and despite the fact that he was/is so hot, it was a very unique and cool show.
Gary Hobson gets kicked out of his house by his wife and is forced to move into a hotel room.  A mysterious cat delivers the newspaper, and soon Gary realises that it's actually tomorrows newspaper.  From there, the episodes revolve around him trying to prevent the crimes or accidents he reads about.  His friend Chuck (Fisher Stevens) was hilarious as Gary's best friend and there was also Marissa.  They were the only two other people that knew about the paper.  Chuck often wanted to use the paper for his own personal gain like in the stock market or lottery or to get dates, but Gary never allowed it.
My favourite episode of this season is Frostbit where Gary is stranded during a save and Chuck now has to save Gary.  I could go on and on about how good this show is, but you have to check it out for yourself.  It is so cool because it's a fantasy for a lot of people - what would you do if you could see/read the future.  It isn't always as easy as it would seem.  I love this show and can't wait to get my copy.",1214265600,8,1276,4.146341463414634
3024529,5,B000YA82GA,I've been waiting for this release for some time. I just hope the transfer and audio are servicable.,1213228800,4,100,4.611111111111111
3024530,4,B000YA82GA,"Kyle Chandler fans, rejoice!  The future ""Coach Taylor"" stars here as Gary Hobson, a Chicago stockbroker who finds his career to be soulless and dull, until fate intervenes and gives him a new calling, along with a mysterious subscription to a newspaper from the future.  Granted a chance to see tomorrow's news today, Gary chooses to transform tragedies into triumphs and help others avoid disaster, rather than use the paper to make lots of money (which is what his weasly best friend wants him to do...)

This 6-DVD box set gathers the first of four seasons of ""Early Edition,"" establishing the characters and giving them room to grow.  Like most TV series, it takes a while for the actors and producers to find the right rhythm -- the show's quirky premise lends itself to formulaic episodes (Gary finds out about, then averts, various tragedies; Gary flirts with but never quite connects with one interesting, gutsy modern gal after another... Gary's friends flutter about the horizon, giving him advice and helping him save lives; Gary complains about the burden fate has placed on his shoulders.) But the mystery of the magical newspapers helps move the show forward, and Chandler is such a charming, soulful performer that any show that gives him this much screen time is a delight.

""Early Edition,"" which ran from 1996-2000, has an oddly dated feel, as if it had been made in the 1980s, when TV was still under the spell of the '70s.  It recalls other episodic supernatural/timetravel-y shows, notably ""Quantum Leap"" (which also had an adventure-of-the-week, do-good-deeds premise) and the similarly quirky ""Wonderfalls,"" which also featured a likable but often cranky workaday person chosen by a higher power to fulfill a task that was never quite clearly defined and was often burdensome and unwanted. At the heart f it all is Mr. Chandler and his puppydog eyes... Fans of his work will definitely want to check this out as well... and seasons 2-4, too, if they come out on DVD as well. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1212883200,3,2034,4.932748538011696
3024531,5,B000YA82GA,"Add me to the list of fans who love this show, and have been clamoring for it to come out on DVD.  We used to enjoy it in reruns after the show was canceled by CBS, but even those went away.

I've been checking here every so often to see if it was ever going to come out, and was thrilled to see that season one will finally be out on June 24!  Of course, I pre-ordered right away.

To all of you EE fans who have been awaiting this release...please put your money where your mouth is, and buy it.  High sales = more of a chance that they will release the rest of the seasons.  We asked for it, we're getting it, now let's make it worth their while for putting it out!

Thanks, and enjoy the DVD set when you get it!",1212624000,7,716,3.896551724137931
3024532,5,B000YA82GA,"Early Edition was one of the most interesting and entertaining hours on television during its run and it's nice to see this fabulous show finally get released. The characters were likable, and all too human at times, making them even more likable. Kyle Chandler proved the perfect choice as a regular guy with foibles who at first tries to cash in like any of us would on his good fortune, then realizes the great responsibility which has been laid at his door, quite literally.

Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) has been kicked out by his wife and forced to find a hotel. A yellow cat accompanies a newspaper which Gary  eventually discovers is quite special. It is tomorrow's news today, and day after day it is delivered to Gary's door. He reacts as most of us would at first but his good nature finally takes over and he realizes there is a reason he's been chosen to receive the paper.

What followed each week was fabulous. One week it was humorous and the next heartbreaking. Shanesia Williams was terrific as his blind pal Marissa, who tried to keep him grounded and lead him towards the right path when the direction seemed unclear. Fisher Stevens was perfectly cast as his pal Chuck, who wanted to take advantage of Gary's windfall but often ended up helping him instead because deep down he was a good guy. It was sort of like Rockford and Angel, just less pronounced. At least in season one.

What helped to make the show special was the Chicago atmosphere and some tightly written shows about delicate choices made from the heart, some of which had grave consequences. If you can't do both, do you stop a plane from crashing and taking untold lives, or attempt to save one young girl? If you fall in love with someone you've saved, and feel that joy of finally finding someone, what do you do if you discover she's destined to reunite with someone from her past? And what do you do when people begin to think it's odd you should show up at so many disasters and such at just the right moment to save someone?

The show's characters and their interactions had a very real feel and each show had its share of fine moments. Often mixed with humor, but sometimes quite poignant in the end, each week was special. One touching episode had Gary debating over whether not to save one life, because it would give a heart for a transplant which would save a young girl. There was always a balance, however, and the show could be touching but never became maudlin. And it could often find quirky humor within some of the dilemmas.

Season one episodes include:  Pilot --  The Choice -- Baby -- The Paper -- Thief Swipes Mayor's Dog -- Hoop Dreams -- After Midnight -- Gun --  His Girl Thursday --The Wrong Man -- Christmas -- Frostbit -- Mob Wife -- The Wall, Part I, -- The Wall, Part II -- Bat Masterson -- The Jury -- Psychic -- The Cat -- Phantom at the Opera -- Faith -- Dad -- Love is Blind

Amid all the questionable releases of television shows undeserving, Early Edition truly stands out as something of quality. Gary and his friends, and that mysterious yellow cat, were welcome visitors each week and this is a fantastic release for the show's many fans.",1212537600,71,3163,4.513986013986014

It was on the worst night of the week on CBS, but it set the standard for this type of time manipulation show. It had all the great episodes - like when the cat ran away and led Gary to his predecessor's dying girlfriend. Or the girl who could see the future, and then saw Gary come in and change it.

The show lost something when Fisher Stevens left, and was replaced by Kristy Swanson, but it was finding itself again in the final season.

3258683,5,B000YA82GA,"Oh yes!  One of TV's few quality shows finally makes it to DVD.  Nothing but good memories comes from watching Early Edition.  The action, the drama, and the comedy all add up to this great experience.  The acting is superb with Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights, and People magazine's sexiest man of the year) and my personal favorite Fisher Stevens (Awake, Short Circuit, and TV's Lost).

The writing is first rate. Unlike some shows, you'll never feel like you're watching the same thing.  Every episode is a new story, with twists and turns that epitomize suspense drama.

The running theme of moral dilemmas violently challenges the American media norm.  In each mind-bending episode, ideals are questioned and philosophies are put to the test, rather than Hollywood's preference to throw ethics out the window.

In this way, a smart, hip, and entertaining series can be enjoyed by pleasure seekers and intellectuals alike.",1209686400,5,929,5.099337748344371

3258721,2,B000YA82GA,"Long before Person of Interest topped the ratings, there was a show with a similar premise. It was nothing as sophisticated as Harold's machine, and was constantly facing cancellation, but it too predicted and tried to prevent future crimes.

Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) is an ordinary guy who is down on his luck, when he mysteriously starts receiving a copy of tomorrows newspaper at his door. His best friend, Chuck (Fisher Stevens), wants to use the information to get rich, but Gary has other plans. He wants to use the information to stop crimes from being committed and enters a world he is not at all prepared for.

The show is similar to Person of Interest, but didn't do nearly as well, because the whole thing is hokey. The show is rarely serious and full of very amateurish jokes. Kyle Chandler play a pretty interesting guy, but he's the only believable character. His best friend is an ass, who would be in jail, and his partner is a blind woman. Not to mention there is some weird angle with the stray cat Gary adopts, that doesn't make much sense.

The whole stopping crimes before they happen came about in Minority Report and garnered major success for shows like Person of Interest, but it may have gotten it's start with Early Edition, a show with a terrific premise, that was unfortunately barely watchable.",1453507200,,1328,4.7155172413793105

The Hobson character is charming, witty, committed to the truth, thinks about others, and bases his life on good values. Other regulars spice up the plots, especially Gary's good friend, Chuck Fishman, a cynical guy who admires Gary even while lamenting that the hero doesn't use his early information for personal gain.",1407715200,,629,4.933962264150943

3258826,5,B000YA82GA,This show had the best concept of any show. Finding a way to stop whatever bad that is about to happen. The problems Gary would run up against was what ever you do may have a ripple effect that you can never see coming. It kept me on the edge of my seat for and hour. Never missed it. I really liked how all characters eventualy as the season progressed became a part of Gary's team. The only draw back is we only have 2 seasons out of the 4 to purchase. I'm beginning to look twice when these kind of show are offered as a season to season purchase. I've been fooled before but never more. I will not buy unless the shows are in a complete series form. Because I bought Early Edition only when their were 2 seasons thinking only 2 more to go so they must be planing to make these available But it has been a Very long time and with No hope of season 3 and 4 being put out for purchase. I really don't think the manufacturers care because this practice is becoming more and more the norm. They waste alot of start up money when they do this. But if they would offer a complete series for these shows more would buy hence making for a more happy buyer out hear. I know I would be more apt to buy if they offered programing in it's complete form. These are shows that are no longer in production so making it a complete series would be an easy task. More purchases more profits think about it. I don't buy anything that is older that could be sold as a Complete series and isn't.,1362700800,4,1477,4.096551724137931

3258852,5,B000YA82GA,"I remember watching this first season when I was 14-15.  Young as I was, I enjoyed it, but didn't fully comprehend it.  I purchased this DVD set a few months ago, and I fully understand the meaning of the show.

It's more than just a show about a guy who receives the paper a day early.  That's just the surface.  At the start of the series, Gary loses his job, his wife and home- essentially his whole life.  But he doesn't complain.  With the paper, he could easily get rich off of gambling or stocks (as his buddy Chuck wants to do).  Instead he uses it for the best.  Basically, Gary Hobson is a man who doesn't complain about how bad he has it, but he spends his days trying to save or make others' lives better.  And that's the beauty of this show that I only understand now.  These days, especially with the current economy, it's easy to complain about how bad we have it.  But it takes a real man to decide to better the lives of others instead.  In our society, Gary Hobson would be termed a has been, a bum.  No- he's a real man (spoiler!!!)... how many of us would give up a woman we loved, just so she could be happy?

One of my favorite parts about the show is the same thing I liked when I was a kid- Chuck's pondering thoughts in the opening and closing of each episode.  Reflections on life- without any preaching.

Other than that- the video quality is great- hard to believe that these scenes were shot in the mid 1990s.  And, it makes you retrospectively look back with fondness on a time not so long ago- a show without sex and violence, and where people weren't tied to their cellphones.",1354579200,9,1608,4.250825082508251

3258880,5,B000YA82GA,"This delightfully original fantasy-drama centers on Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler), a young stockbroker at Chicago's Strauss & Associates, whose wife throws him out on their fourth anniversary.  The next morning the doorstep of his hotel room is graced by an orange cat with a piercing yowl, a motorboat purr, and a copy of the Sun-Times.  But this is no ordinary Sun-Times: it's tomorrow's.  It takes Gary a little while to figure out what he has here, but when he does he realizes that ""this is a powerful tool, not something to mess around with.""  Why it comes to him or how, he doesn't know, but he knows what he has to do.  As Sam Beckett of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-Leap-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JM3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;""puts right what once went wrong,"" so Gary embarks upon a career of putting things right *before* they can go wrong--exposing political corruption and preventing crimes, accidents, traffic jams, family breakups, and other assorted human tragedies, sometimes at the risk of his own life, and mostly on a local scale (though at least once he stops a space-shuttle explosion, once a nuclear meltdown in Russia, and once, in the complex and chilling two-parter ""The Wall,"" he finds himself involved in a planned Presidential assassination), even though his warnings often have people suspecting him of being a meddler, a masher, a crank, or, at best, ""some kind of psychic.""  He's supported (and occasionally hindered) by his best friend Chuck Fishman (Fisher Stevens), a fellow stockbroker and former college roommate, who constantly importunes him for tips on the market, pro sports, or the next lottery winner, by Marissa Clark (Shanesia Davis), a blind receptionist of boundless faith, and by tough 30-year-veteran Detective Lt. Zeke Crumb (Ron Dean) of the Chicago PD, who isn't sure what to make of him but by the end of the season is advising people that they can ""trust"" him.  Chandler's Hobson is somewhat reminiscent of many of James Stewart's parts; he has that same aw-shucks innocence updated with a '90's anger that he was picked for this job without even knowing he was under consideration for it--often he complains bitterly about how ""the Paper"" won't let him have a life, and at least once he tries to reject it, but Cat keeps bringing it all the same.  As the series proceeds we learn more and more about it--how it works, who got it last, what Cat's powers are (and he definitely has some strange ones)--and even Chuck, whom some viewers may find annoying, gets a chance to shine when, in ""The Wall,"" he demonstrates sturdy loyalty and selflessness.  There's also a good share of humor, particularly when Gary's visiting father (William Devane) finds out about the Paper and (as Gary had feared he would) immediately decides he wants to help--and actually shows a flair for the job.  A perfect mix of drama, lighthearted fun, and intriguing unanswered questions makes this a thoroughly enjoyable series that should have lasted longer than it did.",1324684800,,3110,5.2269076305220885

3258918,2,B000YA82GA,"Early Edition is a show about a guy who get tomorrows newspaper, today. As a result he run all over Chicago with his two side kicks, a greedy, unsympathetic stock broker and a wise blind lady and prevents crime and accidents from happening all the while trying to deal with his own complicated life. The show try to be drama but do not really succeed, it tries to be mystery, but do not make it there either. if I was to put it in any category it would be the same as Touched By An Angel and Highway to Heaven but without these show's religious element or magic, but with the same feel good stories. The main character Gary find someone to help and all turn out well in the end.

Now this show have a good premise. A mean who predict the future, but in a bit unusual way, with tomorrows newspaper instead of more common ESP and decides to do something about it and use his gift to help pepole. There are however some huge problems with this show. First of all it is extremely repetitive. Gary saves pepole, Chuck, the stock broker tries to make a quick buck and Marissa the blind lady give sagely advice. It is always the same, again and again and again. Problem, sob story, happy ending. Now another problem is the characters, they are so paper thin. Gary is perfect, he never falls for the temptation to use the newspaper for personal gain, he never sneak in lines, he do not raise his voice, he do not walk on bloody red light. Seriously, nobody is that bloody goody, goody perfect. Then we have Chuck, he is egoistic, only want money and is far more realistic than Gary, but why the hell do these two hang out? And then we have Marissa, she is blind, and wise and give good advice, she is like a poser child for I have a disability but that is okey. The wise blind person, have we not seen this before, far to many times. There are some more regular cast being added in laster seasons. I have only seen season 1, perhaps the show will get better then, but I doubt it. The far best character of the show is the cat. The hundred years old, supernatural pussy who bring Gary the paper, it have personality, the other characters do not. It makes me want to see an entire show with mystery pus and just do away with all the other useless characters.

There is a continuing story in the show, what is the newspaper, who is the cat and so on, but it moves so slowly it is difficult to stay interested in it. When I sit watching this show I think damned, this could have been so good, but it is so boring, where the hell did they go wrong, they have such a great concept! In all fairness Early Edition is not all bad it do provide some scenes that are amusing, and it is fun to watch, now and again. But if you are buying this series as a DVD box set for a marathon, you will get disappointed.

The actors to seam bored when they play this series. I do not know how much more I can say about it. The series have a wonderful premise, but have been executed with not even a hint of creativity, is is a paper thing, drama wannabe supernatural show with to much aspirations and to little guts. Watching an episode now and again is fine, but any more and I want to punch Gary in the nose. I give this show 4 out of 10. Not horrible, but still far from good. Though as I said I have just watched the first season, perhaps I will update this review when I have seen the rest of the series. But I am not hopeful that I will be more amused by that.",1270512000,2,3435,4.154654654654655

3258957,5,B000YA82GA,"After watching too many Stargate episodes, murder mysteries, and spy movies it was a relief to watch a TV series where people weren't dying left and right or constantly in mortal danger.  Although action is exciting, watching so many people get hurt or killed makes me heartsick.  Early Edition, a TV show about a man named Gary who got tomorrow's newspaper every morning, was a TV show with depth, an intelligent plot, character development, and impeccable acting.  Gary's knowledge of the future leads him on many goose chases and puts him in hilarious situations.  I was immediately caught up in Gary's struggles to accept the paper and figure out how to save everyone.  As I watched the series I thought that the premise of knowing the future and saving lives would get old, but it did not.  The screen writers were very creative and put unexpected twists in every episode.  (Personally, I despise predictable plotlines) Not only were the stories captivating, but the acting was delightful.  Kyle Chandler is the perfect actor to portray a man who isn't quite comfortable with being a goody two shoes.  His best friend Chuck is the comic relief whose constant attempts to use the paper to get money kept me laughing the whole way. His other friend Marissa is a sweet reminder of what Gary's conscience is always telling him.
  All in all, an excellent series with delightful dialogue and a smart sense of humor.  This is a series that lifts your spirits.  It has little swearing and no sex scenes, a great choice for family TV.",1226620800,7,1531,4.775665399239544

3258964,5,B000YA82GA,"I watched this show when it was first on the air, and after watching it again on DVD for the first time in years, I was struck by how well it still holds up in this decade.  In fact, if this show was airing right now, I honestly think it would be the best show on television.

To start, the premise is extremely interesting and original: a Chicago man, Gary Hobson, holds the future in his hand: he mysteriously receives tomorrow's newpaper a day early.  He must make many moral decisions as to how he is going to use the paper -  for his advantange, or for other peoples' advantage.  Of course, for those who really appreciate Kyle Chandler's boyish, innocent looks, we already know he's a good guy in this.

Every episode involves stories in the newspaper, mostly tragic, that Gary must try to fix or prevent.  However, such is life, where one thing is often connected to another, be it people or events, and situations are not always what they seem. Many episodes take us through exciting twists and turns, and before we know it, a 40-minute episode is sadly over.

What I love about ""Early Edition"" is its tremendous heart.  I never cry when I watch television and most movies, but I think this show wins in making me tear up with gladness in more than several episodes throughout its four-year run, especially during the first season.  Episodes like ""The Choice,"" where Gary must decide who to save from death, ""Gun,"" which shows the devestating effects of a broken-up family, ""Hoops,"" and ""Faith,"" where a young girl helps Gary reevaluate the kind of faith he puts in his paper, are uplifting and helps us believe in a world that still has hope and goodness in it.  Sounds cliche, but I'll take a show that celebrates the goodness in people over ones that seem to take joy in showing heartache and violence as a result of the evil people do.

Other episodes such as ""His Girl Thursday,"" ""The Wall 1+2,"" ""Psychic,"" ""Phantom at the Opera,"" and ""Love is Blind"" are exciting and at times very intense mysteries that showcase the classic ""Early Edition"" comedy and engaging story lines.  Kyle Chandler as the bumbling, kind-hearted, and adorable Gary Hobson, as well as Fisher Stevens (as best buddy Chuck) and Shanesia Davis (as blind friend Marissa), make ""Early Edition"" one of my favorite series for its high quality stories, humor, performances, and heart-felt messages.",1219449600,6,2376,4.7101449275362315
3258985,5,B000YA82GA,"I have no idea why this show ever when off the air.  Kyle Chandler was sweet and wonderful as the reluctant hero.  This show had so many possiblitlies, I really feel like it could have gone on for more years.  Every show left me feeling good, I rarely didn't have at least one laugh in every show, and there was always a moment were the viewer held their breath as Gary may or may not live to see another paper.  What more could you want?  I can hardly wait until the rest of these seasons come out on dvd.  Let's hope it doesn't go the way of Night Court and we only see this one season put out.",1219276800,4,596,4.008474576271187

What I like about this show, besides the obvious-the handsome Kyle Chandler, is that it is a mixture of comedy, suspense, drama, with the humaness of someone trying to make a difference by helping others, thus changing the outcome.  The idea that we are all connected and how we treat others has an impact on your life and the life of others.

I never saw this before but with all the junk on TV and the good stuff getting cancelled after one or two seasons, I've been getting more and more TV shows on DVD - and trying shows I never saw before.  Sometimes there's dud that sounded really good, sometimes there' a show like this that I really wasn't sure would be any good but decided to try it and was pleasantly surprised.  It's like an unexpected birthday present of exactly what you wanted.

It's a great feel-good show with drama, comedy, talent, layered characters, good actors, just an all around great show.  I hope this isn't one of those where they release one great season and then some idiot decides to put the rest in a vault somewhere.  I don't know how many seasons there were, but I gathered there's more than one so I sure hope they put out the rest of it.

3258993,5,B000YA82GA,"What a great show and great DVD set, at a very reasonable price (currently $29.99 at Amazon).  Nearly 12 years since it first aired, I am very glad to finally have this DVD set, first time it's ever been available in any format. Six DVDs, very well packaged in a plastic box.  Each DVD is securely in place and easily accessible, yet the entire box is only the width of a normal DVD.  The only downside to the packaging is that the episode guide is covered up by DVD #1 and DVD #6, so you have to remove those to read the guide, or else open the package wide and pull out the insert to read the guide.  But who wants to read the guide anyway, when the enjoyment here is from playing all the DVDs from beginning to end?  I'd rather be surprised than read the DVD guide ahead of time.  A guide like this is only valuable for identifying favorite episodes to re-watch anyway, as far as I'm concerned.  I say just watch the episodes from the beginning, without looking at the episode guide ahead of time.

As far as the picture and sound quality here goes, it's great.  I was a little surprised that the 6 DVDs are one sided rather than double sided. Although double sided DVDs can have quality problems, so maybe it's best that these are one sided.  There are 23 episodes here, each of about 45 minutes (that's the ""hour"" without commercials), so most of these have a little over 3 hours of content (there are also ""trailers"" for each episode, but I did not watch those).  I thought that putting 3 hours of content on one DVD would result in over-compression, but the picture and sound still are really good.  On my PC if I looked extremely closely I could see an ultra-tiny bit of graininess (most movies I've seen on DVD have this too), but that's extremely minor.  I'm especially happy about the quality given the age of the show, 12 years to put this to DVD. The sound is really good and clear too, which as you recall is important - the famous title music is well preserved here.

As to the show itself, that's been well discussed by others.  I'll just add that this is one of those programs where character development does matter, so it's great to be able to have this from the beginning.  There are a lot of recurring characters throughout the four years of Early Edition.  And don't get too hung up on little things like the date of the newspaper in the pilot vs. the other episodes.  The date of the paper in the pilot episode shows November, while the later episodes refer to Gary getting the paper starting in September.  Apparently the origin of the paper was changed to September to coincide with the first airings of those episodes (i.e. also in September).  So when the pilot episode says ""November"" on the paper, just think ""September"", and it works.  Especially given that the first episode refers to the Chicago Cubs, which would not have been playing in November anyway. Hey it's a tv show, a unique and terrific one.  And I'm very happy with the way these DVDs turned out.  Now if we can get the other three seasons, I'll be even happier.  But even if season 1 is all we get, it's highly enjoyable, so I definitely recommend it.",1214697600,6,3146,4.412478336221837

3259025,5,B000YA82GA,"I am so glad that this is about to get released - about time.  I loved watching this great show all the time and almost never missed an episode.  I love Kyle Chandler (Gary) and despite the fact that he was/is so hot, it was a very unique and cool show.
Gary Hobson gets kicked out of his house by his wife and is forced to move into a hotel room.  A mysterious cat delivers the newspaper, and soon Gary realises that it's actually tomorrows newspaper.  From there, the episodes revolve around him trying to prevent the crimes or accidents he reads about.  His friend Chuck (Fisher Stevens) was hilarious as Gary's best friend and there was also Marissa.  They were the only two other people that knew about the paper.  Chuck often wanted to use the paper for his own personal gain like in the stock market or lottery or to get dates, but Gary never allowed it.
My favourite episode of this season is Frostbit where Gary is stranded during a save and Chuck now has to save Gary.  I could go on and on about how good this show is, but you have to check it out for yourself.  It is so cool because it's a fantasy for a lot of people - what would you do if you could see/read the future.  It isn't always as easy as it would seem.

3259027,4,B000YA82GA,"Kyle Chandler fans, rejoice!  The future ""Coach Taylor"" stars here as Gary Hobson, a Chicago stockbroker who finds his career to be soulless and dull, until fate intervenes and gives him a new calling, along with a mysterious subscription to a newspaper from the future.  Granted a chance to see tomorrow's news today, Gary chooses to transform tragedies into triumphs and help others avoid disaster, rather than use the paper to make lots of money (which is what his weasly best friend wants him to do...)

This 6-DVD box set gathers the first of four seasons of ""Early Edition,"" establishing the characters and giving them room to grow.  Like most TV series, it takes a while for the actors and producers to find the right rhythm -- the show's quirky premise lends itself to formulaic episodes (Gary finds out about, then averts, various tragedies; Gary flirts with but never quite connects with one interesting, gutsy modern gal after another... Gary's friends flutter about the horizon, giving him advice and helping him save lives; Gary complains about the burden fate has placed on his shoulders.) But the mystery of the magical newspapers helps move the show forward, and Chandler is such a charming, soulful performer that any show that gives him this much screen time is a delight.

""Early Edition,"" which ran from 1996-2000, has an oddly dated feel, as if it had been made in the 1980s, when TV was still under the spell of the '70s.  It recalls other episodic supernatural/timetravel-y shows, notably ""Quantum Leap"" (which also had an adventure-of-the-week, do-good-deeds premise) and the similarly quirky ""Wonderfalls,"" which also featured a likable but often cranky workaday person chosen by a higher power to fulfill a task that was never quite clearly defined and was often burdensome and unwanted. At the heart f it all is Mr. Chandler and his puppydog eyes... Fans of his work will definitely want to check this out as well... and seasons 2-4, too, if they come out on DVD as well.

3259029,5,B000YA82GA,"Early Edition was one of the most interesting and entertaining hours on television during its run and it's nice to see this fabulous show finally get released. The characters were likable, and all too human at times, making them even more likable. Kyle Chandler proved the perfect choice as a regular guy with foibles who at first tries to cash in like any of us would on his good fortune, then realizes the great responsibility which has been laid at his door, quite literally.

Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) has been kicked out by his wife and forced to find a hotel. A yellow cat accompanies a newspaper which Gary  eventually discovers is quite special. It is tomorrow's news today, and day after day it is delivered to Gary's door. He reacts as most of us would at first but his good nature finally takes over and he realizes there is a reason he's been chosen to receive the paper.

What followed each week was fabulous. One week it was humorous and the next heartbreaking. Shanesia Williams was terrific as his blind pal Marissa, who tried to keep him grounded and lead him towards the right path when the direction seemed unclear. Fisher Stevens was perfectly cast as his pal Chuck, who wanted to take advantage of Gary's windfall but often ended up helping him instead because deep down he was a good guy. It was sort of like Rockford and Angel, just less pronounced. At least in season one.

What helped to make the show special was the Chicago atmosphere and some tightly written shows about delicate choices made from the heart, some of which had grave consequences. If you can't do both, do you stop a plane from crashing and taking untold lives, or attempt to save one young girl? If you fall in love with someone you've saved, and feel that joy of finally finding someone, what do you do if you discover she's destined to reunite with someone from her past? And what do you do when people begin to think it's odd you should show up at so many disasters and such at just the right moment to save someone?

The show's characters and their interactions had a very real feel and each show had its share of fine moments. Often mixed with humor, but sometimes quite poignant in the end, each week was special. One touching episode had Gary debating over whether not to save one life, because it would give a heart for a transplant which would save a young girl. There was always a balance, however, and the show could be touching but never became maudlin. And it could often find quirky humor within some of the dilemmas.

Season one episodes include:  Pilot --  The Choice -- Baby -- The Paper -- Thief Swipes Mayor's Dog -- Hoop Dreams -- After Midnight -- Gun --  His Girl Thursday --The Wrong Man -- Christmas -- Frostbit -- Mob Wife -- The Wall, Part I, -- The Wall, Part II -- Bat Masterson -- The Jury -- Psychic -- The Cat -- Phantom at the Opera -- Faith -- Dad -- Love is Blind
