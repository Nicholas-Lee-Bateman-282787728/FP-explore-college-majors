8614624,3,B00FDZ7W7G,"I have always been a fan of science fiction movies and I am continually searching for some of the old features I saw as a kid.  This is why I purchased this movie collection (They Came from Space : 20 amazing s ci-Fi Features) collection.  I had never seen the first three features (The infinite worlds of H.G. Wells Parts 1,2, and 3) and thought the stories were okay.  I did not care for most of these movies, but I did enjoy the old Buck Rogers movie (Planet Outlaws even though it was grainy Black and white) starring the late Buster Crabbe, Warriors of the wasteland with Fred Williamson and Battle of the Worlds starring Claude Rains.  I had hoped to find a couple of old Science Fiction movies I saw as a youngster in this collection but I do not think they ever made it to the DVDs.

Even though I was somewhat disappointed in this science fiction collection, but I will keep searching for some of the great old science fiction movies made in the 1950s and 1960s.  If you are into older science fiction movies you might want to check this DVD out.  You should keep in mind that the special affects and space ships in this collection do not compare with the modern science fiction movies like Star Trek, Aliens  and Star Wars.  In fact, you will probably get a good laugh at some of these features because they were so bad.  However, I remember watching the Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials at the movies every week when I was a youngster.

8614625,3,B00FDZ7W7G,"20 movies for $10 ( when it was actually available). They say ""If it sounds too good to be true it probably is"" and this release proves it . With 5 movies on a standard dual layer disc you have to expect quality compromises. I purchased for the HG Wells 3 parter and while it shows pixellation and noise that you would expect from a disc with 5 movies on it the quality is acceptable and the Invasion 2 parter is similar. Disc 2 is another story. Alien Contamination may be one of the better known movies on this release but if you're buying to see it then get the proper dvd from Blue Underground or others. Mill Creek could have used the same video master that was used for the 80's VHS release and it would have been better than what they've delivered which is clearly a direct transfer from a VHS tape . That's right - this is a dvd that is still VHS quality . The rest of Disc 2 is almost as disappointing so I've not ventured to the other 2 discs yet . Some of the films on this set have had releases elsewhere and of infinitely superior quality so you'd be advised to look for those . I don't know of any other dvd release for the ones I was interested in so I'm stuck with it .  I actually expected 5 discs which would have been bad enough but 4 discs ? Mill Creek seem to aim their releases at the market who buy because its cheap then throw it away when they realise the quality is rubbish rather than people who buy because they actually want to see the films on the discs . This might keep the kids quiet but discerning customers won't be very happy . Good value ? Definitely . Good quality ? Not even close .",1389744000,5,1621,4.09748427672956
