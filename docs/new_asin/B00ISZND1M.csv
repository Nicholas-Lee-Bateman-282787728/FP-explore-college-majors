6291044,4,B00ISZND1M,"This is a thought provoking movie that should be viewed twice. Very well done, wonderful acting, directing, and story. Aidan Brostow is a star that should be in more movies. One of the best you'll find on Amazon, but not for everybody.",1467936000,,235,4.619047619047619

6291047,4,B00ISZND1M,"I liked the way the characters developed, and how the mystery unfolded. I enjoyed the twists and turns. I planned to watch only half tonight, but it kept me hooked until the end. I won't post any spoilers, but I initially thought the movie was going to explore human relationships on a superficial level. However, it addressed more complex interactions, the relationships we form in our own minds, and the how a relationship can grow and change, even after a person's death, as well as how each person plays a role in the lives of others. I particularly enjoyed the ""relationship"" between Claire and the protagonist. My only critique is that the female characters appeared to be viewed through the lens of their male counterparts, not so much as individuals with unique qualities outside of their relationships with men. But I guess it also works, as an exploration of how some teenage males might think.",1466467200,2,904,4.838709677419355
6291048,5,B00ISZND1M,"Sleeper hit of the year; Director Dan Ast makes a bold entrance into the halls of cinematography with his title Claire.

overall impression? the movie takes its time, immerses you in the life and atmosphere of Jack. Aftet several heart-skipping, brow-raising, jaw-clenching twists and turns, the plot sets your heart ablaze then drops it into the arctic. It does what so many stories try to do- it captivates. The characters, and their actors, showcase a budding professional talent. A well timed soundtrack and crisp camera and editing work keep the nuance and mood clear and focused.
...and Claire? She is enough to haunt any memory. The girl you never knew; the girl you should have known",1401926400,3,691,4.956896551724138
6291049,4,B00ISZND1M,"So many psychological thrillers (especially low budget films) are painfully predictable.  Not so with Claire.  Clever writing, beautiful cinematography, convincing performances...what's not to like?  Recommended.",1401062400,5,212,7.4
6291050,5,B00ISZND1M,A beautifully acted independent feature that feels bigger than their budget would indicate. Incredible score and music in this film too!,1400889600,2,136,5.523809523809524
6291051,5,B00ISZND1M,"I was fortunate to see a viewing of this movie, and just absolutely loved it. It has all the traits of a good psychological thriller. Bristow is no saint, but could he have actually played a role in the death of Claire? His conscious surely feels like he's guilty.... but if he didn't know her, how could he have done it? Bristow takes us through all those questions and more, and gives as a truly emotional performance. This may be a low budget film, but you'll soon find yourself feeling and projecting yourself onto the characters in this movie as it is all relative.

If you enjoy independent, low budget films that have people who love story telling and the art of film making, you'll appreciate this film.",1399507200,3,711,4.5546875
6291082,5,B00ISZND1M,"I thought this was a very good movie. Very well written and poignant. It's about ""righting"" your wrongs.",1489276800,,104,4.833333333333333
6291083,3,B00ISZND1M,The movie seemed to drag out a bit. The plot had holes in it but came together in the end. I gave it three stars because it did keep my attention.,1486771200,,146,3.7419354838709675

6291088,3,B00ISZND1M,"The description of this movie got me interested in seeing it. I guess I was picturing something similar to the movie Unfriended or something similar, but it's not that kind of movie. It never gets intense, or scary at all. However, its a very well made, and VERY well acted low budget movie. All the characters come off as real, especially the two main characters friendship. And it's a very well written movie, but very slow. It doesn't start to pick up till 45 minutes in, and even at that point, the movie never really takes off. The story gets very complex, although it easy to follow, and you can see some of the twists coming. I enjoyed the movie but it feels every bit of 1 hour and 38 minutes.",1479427200,,701,4.358778625954199

The neg. comments didn't seem to finish the movie.
This movie deserves to be a T.V, series!

Very unexpected twists... and unpredictable
I watched this movie and felt as though I were reliving my own high school drama!
This movie will hit you in the gut!

6291098,5,B00ISZND1M,"I love it. It's not getting the credit it deserves. Yes, it starts off slow, and maybe even clich, but if you're a psyche major or into psychology and the innerworkings of how a person's mind unravels, you'll truly enjoy this movie. Look past the humble budget. The acting is good. It's very believable. The reactions of the characters are relatable and age appropriate. I was very impressed with how wrapped up I got into this movie after I read the mixed reviews. I felt as if I was on a journey, along with Jake, to uncover the truth behind Claire's secret crush.",1474761600,7,566,4.504854368932039

6291101,1,B00ISZND1M,"an utterly repugnant film extolling criminal gang value systems.  Included are implied personal responsibility of the victims for criminal poisonings such as Claire with the drug made available to Derek by the Marriage You Wanna distributor Aiden and the drunk driver aggressively encouraged to be drunk by medifrauds.  Included are ownership of persons such as Jack by Ami and then Nancy under the felony religionist ""marriage"" philosophy.  Included is the notion that the criminal gang demands for poisoning and slave ownership are somehow ""forgivable"" by the victims of those criminal gangs and the inherently toxic nature of groupthink.",1473292800,,640,5.510204081632653

6291128,1,B00ISZND1M,"The story line and the acting did not intrigue me. I found the characters one-dimensional, and the events didn't seem to justify the main character's deepening obsession with Claire; his poor acting didn't help, either. The movie was very slow and, though I hate to use this cliche, pretty boring.",1468627200,4,297,4.96
6291129,3,B00ISZND1M,Not bad but a little far fetched of the main characters obsession about Claire when he did not even know her.,1468540800,,109,4.238095238095238

6291131,4,B00ISZND1M,"I felt this movie was quite good at showing what really goes on in high school, the part of the teenage lives that the parents or adults rarely get a chance to see. I feel strongly that there was no real help for the young man who was suffering from the delusion that the dead girl wanted HIM and loved HIM. It just shows how strong the teenage male ego can be AND how very fragile. I felt sorry for the kid but clearly his actions were wrong and should he should have been helped or discouraged or disciplined in some manner that didn't include his final big discipline . No spoilers . All these kids had to find their way alone with no guidance from teachers or any adults or parents which is very much the case in high schools today, I think, and perhaps why there are so many disturbed teenagers who kill themselves or end up killing others. I thought the movie was well acted. It seemed to me that many of the young actors in this movie were probably actually teenagers. Anyway, I think this was a good movie .",1468368000,3,1015,4.237113402061856
8645126,5,B00ISZND1M,"Thought it was a horror movie, kept waiting for the cliche haunting to start.  Eventually realized it wasn't, but at that point it had already pulled me in.  It's a full on drama, and very interesting story, enjoyed it very much and it's a lot better then 95% of the crap movies out these days, gave it 5 stars, because this little gem deserves it!",1526774400,,348,4.338461538461538
8645127,4,B00ISZND1M,"I almost passed this video up because of the mixed reviews.  But what kept me wanting to watch it is that the mind of a person, the human emotional rollercoaster that is very real for teens was highly praised.  If the human mind and emotions don't intrigue you, you probably should pass it up; but if they do intrigue you, you should watch it.  Aside from the fact that there were no A-list actors in this movie I would not have known it was a B-list movie.  The cinematography alone is beautiful and the actors acted very real.  The only reason that I did not 5-star it was because in the end a relationship I hoped would be there was not there, that disappointed me, but I also understand why it didn't happen.  Some things just can't be fixed by an ""I'm sorry.""  Other than that, I loved the movie.",1523404800,,801,4.3
8645128,1,B00ISZND1M,I only made it through 18 minutes of this movie. Its really slow going and the characters are NOT likeable. The acting is subpar as well. Normally Ill give a movie  at least 30-45 minutes if I cant sit through the whole duration. I couldn't even do that this movie is so bad.,1522713600,,275,4.188679245283019

8645131,1,B00ISZND1M,"Don't watch this movie.  It is incredibly boring.  It's about a deeply self-centered high school football star who thinks he's god's gift to young women, who abuses his friends, and who becomes obsessed with a dead girl.  A big yawn!",1507334400,,233,4.775
8645132,5,B00ISZND1M,The movie had an interesting set of twists and turns and ended on a good note,1500940800,,77,3.875
8645133,4,B00ISZND1M,"Okay, so the mixed reviews almost made me skip this movie. I decided to at least give it a chance. I'm glad I did. The writer and director Dan Ast did a wonderful job writing this script. Anyone that says different has either:
A) Not fully watched the film in its entirety or,
B) Just don't have the intellectual capacity to understand a good story.

With that said, the actors and actresses didn't provide A-list caliber talent, but with a film like this I don't even think it was necessary that they did. They get a B+ in my book. This film is worthy of watching. Awesome plot twists, and also a great perspective into just how fragile human minds can become under seemingly stressful circumstances. If you like psychology then you will like this movie. If you don't like to expand your mind outside of normality then this film is probably not for you.",1500163200,,854,4.509677419354839

8645135,1,B00ISZND1M,"This is horrible! I kept watching in the hopes that something would actually HAPPEN or it would get better, but it was like waiting for Godot.

I honestly can't even tell you what this is really about. Its so bad. Its pointless. This girl is hit and killed by a drunk driver. An injured football player believes he is to blame because she was coming to visit him.

The writing/script are fairly bad, and the acting is mediocre at best. They remind me of high school theatre/thespian society members who are probably the worst out of the group.

The casting is also super horrible. I'm not sure how the two male leads are friends. I'm not sure if its the bad acting or it was supposed to come off like they didn't like each other at all. Every single woman in this movie looks very similar, and due to no standout performances it was hard to tell one from the other. Did the casting director only like young women with straight dark hair? Like what?",1492992000,,948,4.405714285714286
