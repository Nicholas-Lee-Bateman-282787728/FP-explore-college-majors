7846881,4,6303439322,"It's okay. Not the greatest of Bill Nye videos, but okay. It covers Momentum and Pressure (2 individual videos each about 20 min). It shouldve covered other terms and concepts in the momentum video, but eh.",1490745600,,206,4.75
7846882,5,6303439322,The Bill Nye videos are excellent!  I am a third grade teacher and I use them to supplement the science kits we use for science instruction.  The movie jackets also typically include a study/question guide to use with children after viewing the movie.  This particular movie focuses on physical science including momentum and forces.  I love these movies!  This VHS includes two episodes of Bill Nye's series and each one lasts 26 minutes.,1266710400,,439,4.958904109589041
7846883,5,6303439322,"Bill Nye videos are informative and highly entertaining. He approaches science in an extremely approachable and provocative way, that encourages the desire to learn.  Want the entire series",1250035200,,189,5.75
7846884,5,6303439322,"I homeschool my 10 yr old, 8 yr old, 6 yr old, 5 yr old, and 4 yr old; all sit attentively and soak up the Bill Nye the Science Guy shows. I highly recommend all Bill Nye shows to supplement teaching science. My only disappointment with the series is that it isn't on DVD! not even on Blockbuster or Netflix.

Other than that, if you can get your hands on a VHS, or PBS Educational programming run of it (PBS is showing it now actually in the mornings) do sit with your children and watch it, I can't not smile at several points in every episode. Bill Nye holds interest and has the most unique ways of explaining and demonstrating.",1127952000,8,632,4.223140495867769
7846885,5,6303439322,"Momentum... Who knew?! I finally get it! My son gets it! We all got it and it was fun. Bill Nye delivers science using a series of vignettes that illustrate, demonstrate, reenact, spoof, and reinforce without hitting those boring notes we've come to expect from science. I've never been disappointed by a Bill Nye show or video, and this video is no exception.",972950400,14,360,4.73015873015873
