8717468,3,B00Y30OE6E,"This appears to be simply a Polish release of ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For [Blu-ray 3D]"" and thus identical to that movie except for the case text and optional soundtrack and subtitles. If ""A Dame to Die For"" and ""A Dame to Kill For"" (which I own and would give five stars) are different in any meaningful way, and you have seen both, please write a review and identify such differences. Since this is not an actual review but a request for information, I have selected the center star to satisfy the requirement. This may prove to be a unique movie, in which case I will delete this so it can receive actual customer reviews of its own. Otherwise, the Region A version is the better buy.",1510272000,,689,4.348837209302325
