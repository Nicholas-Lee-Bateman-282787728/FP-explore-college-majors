7049688,1,B00UKHJ5RM,I'm probably the biggest horror movie fan ever... Owning more than a thousand horror films. This is one of the top five worst movies I have ever seen do not waste your money. Can't believe someone actually got paid for this.,1432080000,4,224,4.487804878048781

7049690,1,B00UKHJ5RM,"This appears to be one of the worst ""Omen"" type films out there. Nathan (Andy Ostroff) a construction engineer marries Sophia (Heather Adair) who is pregnant. He films everything and not too well. The crucifix on the wall spins upside down, making a loud screeching sound that the couple missed. The film jumps around until their girl Imogene (Alyssa Koerner) is eight years old. We do get to see demons coming from a smokey closet door, caught on camera. The plot had holes. In one scene they shave the hair off the kid to see some hidden Greek letters. She also has control over dogs too.

Camera closeups include urination, a man's elbow, and the top of some guy's head being a downer at the wedding reception...all for realism. Acting and dialogue was as bad as the camera.

7049691,1,B00UKHJ5RM,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! If you enjoy listening to people arguing, dogs barking, and crickets chirping, this movie is for you. It wasn't even scary. It was BORING, and it didn't make much sense. There was a huge glaring plot hole: The comb. What was the point of focusing on this object if an explanation behind it was not going to be provided? Also, the movie failed to explain why the child was chosen by the demon in the first place.

WARNING: Spoiler ahead.

The acting was unconvincing and the main actors (who played the parents) had poor chemistry.  The only (slightly) interesting part of this film was the demon coming out of the closet, which is so cliche. Monster in the closet. Seriously? The best part of the movie was when it ended. Maybe if the movie was told from the demonic kid's perspective, it would have been more interesting. Maybe.

I would have given this movie a quarter of a star if that option was available.",1431734400,8,959,4.494252873563219
7049692,2,B00UKHJ5RM,I rented this stupid dumb movie and after I watched it I still have no friggen clue what went on like really I'm dead serious the kid is supposed to be possessed according to the movie description and all she really did thru the whole entire movie it seems is comb her hair she was obsessed with combing her hair all the time thru the whole movie and that's all she did it wasn't scary it was dumb maybe her comb was possessed,1431648000,10,426,4.144578313253012

7049694,3,B00UKHJ5RM,"The plot is a well constructed, nicely written story that creates a pretty dark nightmare. The found footage has plausibility with the whole camera situation added in at the behest of a family therapist. So that aspect of ""Infernal"" seems solid enough. Overall the film is acted and directed nicely. The production is above basic, with a higher quality of HD camera footage mixed in thanks to the father's new obsession with the ""family exercise"".

The special effects are mixed bag, both in gimmick and in effect. The higher production quality follows through in these paranormal aspects of ""Infernal"" but do not give intended chills or thrills that the director is aiming for. That being said, the last third of this nightmare is truly affective in both dramatic and emotional effect. A totally disturbing slice of paranormal horror.

Overall ""Infernal"" is not the best that paranormal horror or found footage possession flicks offer. Plus I felt there was a deeper spiritual agenda at work in the story, as if this was one of those Church-backed horrors meant to cause the audience to question their own spirituality in hopes to gain new members to Christianity or something along those lines. . It is dark and intense, too bad this sucker didn't catch that bug from the beginning.

7049708,1,B00UKHJ5RM,"Tediously boring and some of the worst dialog in c-movie history. The screen""writer"" (in quotes, purposefully) includes some of the most inane monologues in recent memory. Perhaps the worst is the diatribe at about the 1:10 mark where the wife goes on some esoteric rant that is torn from the pages of a terrible, cliched poetry book. Then there's the bedroom scene at the 50 minute park that sounds like the actress is rehearsing her lines at home in front of a mirror. No, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane here, but even for a c-movie, the writing and acting (and directing) are really good examples of mistakes new filmmakers, screenwriters and actors make. I think the writer forgot to step outside the pages he or she was writing to think how those words would sound when spoken by a character on screen. On paper, Im sure it reads as something profound, but I think he or she got tunnel vision and didn't consider the realism aspect of spoken dialogue vs. the written word.

7049733,4,B00UKHJ5RM,"If you can appreciate Hitchcock's quick cuts and wild angles, it really helps make a movie creepy.  And for me, this story and its telling was creepy. Scripting was really good with well developed characters and actors who played the roles well.  One very small part was a little convoluted, but it was the actor, not the lines.  It was very real dialogue, although I wasn't crazy about the constant swearing.  I guess that was used to generate the unraveling of a family.  Cinematography, along with everything else, was bizarre and kept me on edge. After having seen it, I""m still on edge.  You'll understand after you see the movie.

Its a story about a family that has what they thought was an autistic daughter, but is in reality ????? The daughters ""condition"" has caused a rift between the parents as to what is wrong and what is the best way to help their daughter and themselves. The husband uses cameras to capture what the daughter is doing as requested by their doctor and is another reason not to watch another found footage type/style formated story.

7049745,1,B00UKHJ5RM,"I like found footage movies, and watch lots of them. ""Infernal"" is one of the worst found footage tire fires I've ever seen.

In this movie:

- Everyone says their lines as soon as the other person stops talking. The rhythm and sincerity of dialogue throughout the movie feel like a table read where everyone has major plans afterward and is already running late today.

- The only possessed item appears to be a child's comb. Certainly not the actual child, whose most sinister actions include mentioning that mommy drinks, smiling at something off-camera, and repeatedly asking for her comb.

- A perfectly average, socially functional child of 8 is said to be ""autistic"" mainly so the parents have something to bicker over. One thinks she's a ""burden"", the other thinks that's not cool to say. Neither of them has any apparent skill at child-rearing, but that's moot because a demon lives in her closet and it seems to be doing the parenting. One way to read this movie is that a demon discovered that this kid's parents were incompetent, self-absorbed jerks and took pity on her, deciding to take care of her as best he could.

- The FX money shots are - this is not an exaggeration - roadside haunted house-quality. Thrill at the gel-lit mist and ""creepy"" objects bobbing up and down on visible strings and wires. Try not to giggle at the high school drama club-grade ""demon"" costume, always shown from far away, in silhouette, and briefly. Slap yourself on the forehead in disbelief as a crucifix turns itself upside down on a bare wall in plain sight of both parents while a camera captures it and still no one notices. Tremble at the sounds of your aunt's ""50 Spooky Halloween Sound Effects for Parties"" CD, played together with some pitch-shifted ""demon"" voice saying things that sound (if you can make them out on the muddy soundtrack) a lot like Cobra Commander monologues from the 80s GI Joe cartoon.

- PLUS SIDE: there is one really funny smash-cut in the first act involving the delivery of the child and the mother's displeasure at her decision to have a natural childbirth. Her profane monologue is actually funny and belongs in a better movie.

Infernal is baaaad. I know, you're a bored horror fan craving something to waste time with. So was I, but this one just ain't worth it.",1432857600,5,2298,4.701492537313433

Then sit with your wife and say some idiotic stuff about demons, throw the lot in an editing program and see what comes out. The answer? Nothing worth watching.

Fast forward through the birth of their daughter, nothing until she is 8.  Why?  Who knows?  What we do learn is that daughter is apparently diagnosed as Autistic, tho the parents can't seem to agree on this or even How To Be a Parent.  Their bickering really gets annoying.

Then the people that are their ""friends"" act like nothing is going on as well even though they've seen the footage.  The ""demons"" look so idiotic.
