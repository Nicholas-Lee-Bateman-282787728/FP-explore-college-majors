However, Robert York takes a giant step forward in his new trekking guide.  He shows us that, with just a few miles hike up a Palm Springs trailhead; you can find a refreshingly peaceful world.  York says it well ""Where the rhythm of nature brings back an ageless connection... so peaceful, so clear so pristine, providing an antidote for a bustling civilization.""  I found it to be inspiring and highly motivating.  Gil Lefebvre",1454976000,,584,4.79
