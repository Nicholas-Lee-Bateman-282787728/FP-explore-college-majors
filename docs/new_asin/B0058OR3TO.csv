8462069,5,B0058OR3TO,"I really enjoyed the documentary, but I will warn you, if you are easily bored or are not interested in listening to ideas solely for gaining a differing perspective, I would wait until you are in that sort of mood or else you will not enjoy this for what it is.  The documentary is long, and a lot of it is listening to the Dalai Lama speak, and then listening to his translator. I don't mind it because I was expecting it, having seen recordings of the Dalai Lama previously, but I can see how it would get boring for some people.  The reason I enjoy the documentary, and speaking from the Dalai Lama in general, is that he discusses his private beliefs openly with people. He admits when he doesn't have an answer, but shows a willingness to hypothesize what an answer may be.  Many public figures avoid speculation because they don't want to take risks; however, taking a stance of ""I don't know"" and not offering a hypothesis leads to a stale conversation. It is more interesting to me to listen to someone who is willing to throw out a possibly wrong hypothesis, because often times it is those people who inspire research to begin with, and the Dalai Lama says himself that he will be the first person to admit he is wrong in the face of new evidence. That's a healthy attitude and thought cycle that I think more people should take; throw out ideas, and if they're wrong be happy you know the right answers, and then come up with more hypotheses based on the new information.

The documentary itself has an introduction to Buddhist beliefs about death, struggle and preparing for death and struggle, and then it opens up to questions from the audience. I would recommend knowing something of Buddhist teaching and tantric practices and meditation before watching the documentary as well; the documentary will make more sense if you do.  I do not mean you need to practice meditating for a year before watching, I simply mean know what people are meditating about and how they go about completing the meditations and why.

Most importantly, I enjoyed the documentary because it challenged my beliefs. If I listen to something and am slightly uncomfortable with an idea to begin with, I know I am being closed-minded. No idea should offend someone or make them say ""No, this is wrong because I believe this."" I absolutely love the rare occasions where I hear things and catch myself saying ""That is absolutely silly."" It makes me realize I'm being closed minded, which leads me to challenge my beliefs and theirs, and it leads me to a better understanding and appreciation of both ideas. Looking at things from other people's perspectives, especially if you find them strange at first, is the most rewarding experience you can have; it connects you to more people and makes you think about life from a more diverse, interesting and colorful perspective. This documentary did just that, and that's why I enjoyed it, and I hope you will too.",1356652800,10,2945,4.675675675675675
8462070,5,B0058OR3TO,"This is a recording of a public talk given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 1993 on the subject of Death and Dying from the perspective of a practicing Buddhist.  There is one central camera shot throughout - you do not see the crowd or any thing else; the video is focused only on His Holiness and his translator.  His translator is used about 50% of the time, but he is very articulate and helps the overall discussion rather than hinders it.  His Holiness always adds a compassionate humor to his dialogues, and this is no different.

There are some issues during certain times with the microphone cutting in and out, but if I were to guess, I'd say it was caused by His Holiness adjusting his robe that kept displacing itself from his shoulder and inadvertently bumping the mic.  The problem lasts only a few minutes.  Nonetheless, this presentation is wonderful for those looking to get a Buddhist view on this subject.",1325116800,6,925,4.609756097560975
