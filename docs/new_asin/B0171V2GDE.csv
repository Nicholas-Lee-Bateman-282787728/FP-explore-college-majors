8737897,2,B0171V2GDE,"I honestly don't remember watching not one episode of this show, but it is a classic tv program, I don't understand why this is priced so terrible high?? Keep scrolling and I think this set, is sold for much lower!! Come on sellers these are tv programs!! Not embossed in gold!! Or those of you who work in network, tv for ME TV, start running these shows an other 70's, 80's shows, so sellers would be forced to come down on their prices!! Please!!!",1510531200,4,450,4.369047619047619
8737898,3,B0171V2GDE,It is an awesome box had I bought it complete with all the seasons of disks in it. But I already had purchased all the seasons separately before this box set came out. The individual collectors disk sets will not fit in this box. I gave it to my six year old daughter to put her collectables in. She loves it.,1489190400,3,309,4.081967213114754

8737901,5,B0171V2GDE,I like this box that can hold the Dukes of Hazzard series in it and also is a collectible item.  I like that pictures that are all around it and the details about the series on the bottom of the box.,1479600000,4,199,3.8536585365853657

8737903,1,B0171V2GDE,"I bought this box off ebay, it finally came, I had to take off every cover and stuff all 7 seasons in it. I couldn't get the 2 movies in it, I barely got the seasons in it as you can see in my picture. If it was 2 more inches long I think everything would fit.",1451260800,17,260,3.5789473684210527
