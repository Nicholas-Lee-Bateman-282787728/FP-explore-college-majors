1925580,5,B0000DJZ83,"What you get in The Reel Me is Jennifer Lopez's versatility. She may not have the strongest voice but she is talented none the less. She sings, dances and inspires you. After watching it you may want to dress sexier, take dance lessons and be more assertive. You won't be able to resist dancing and singing along. My favorite video is Ain't It funny where Jennifer is made to look even sexier (if that's possible) by gypsies and ends up with Eduardo Verastegui. This product is definitely entertaining, fun and just worth buying.",1298073600,,529,4.698924731182796

1925587,5,B0000DJZ83,"Ok, I'll get straight to the point. I am one of those people who, when listening to a 5.1 track, wants to be fully pleased.

This DVD does that. Some music DVDs with 5.1 tracks use cheap tricks to make it ""surround"" whether they just use the same track in each channel or emulate a Pro Logic II effect. This DVD, however, takes the 5.1 track above and beyond my expectations. It was like watching all the videos for the first time again. My absolute favorite surround track in this collection is ""Waiting For Tonight."" The song (as all the other songs) has been re-remixed for surround and is just awesome. The way the vocals and instrumentals with samples have been laid out stays fresh and doesn't get old. Most, if not all, of these songs sound much better than the stereo track. Some songs don't seem to really be meant for surround but songs such as ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Play"" are perfect for testing out the surround if you are just getting a new system or want to remember what it's like to love having a good home theater.",1146268800,,1035,4.362694300518135
1925588,5,B0000DJZ83,"As a fan of Jennifer Lopez, I totally enjoyed watching this DVD and listening to the CD.  I feel as if I know quite a bit more about what Jennifer is like as a person rather than just in a movie role.  It was fun to learn about some of the videos she has done and to have those videos to watch whenever I'd like, rather than waiting for them to show up on TV.  I'd highly recommend this set to all Jennifer Lopez fans.",1140393600,2,418,3.8941176470588235
1925589,5,B0000DJZ83,"This DVD needs no review. Every video is off the chain. Jennifer Lopez IS very talented. She has something a lot of people don't have and that's why she is on top of her game. The interview on this DVD show cases what a down to earth person she is yet she still gotta to keep it gangsta for her people. If you are a Jennifer Lopez fan... you gotta have this DVD. If you are not a Jennifer Lopez fan, why are you reading this? One thing I don't understand with all the people who don't like Jennifer Lopez is why do you have to be all up on her grill? If you don't like her music, don't listen to her. Is one thing to be objectionable. We all don't have the same taste. But if you don't like her... why do you keep listening to her? To have something negative to say about her? That is really pathetic. We all gonna have haters no matter what but IF those people would have a ""brain"" then they would have a life.

1925591,5,B0000DJZ83,"I have never been a diehard Jennifer Lopez fan, but I am constantly looking for music video DVD's that have a great dance beat to work out to.  This totally exceeded my expectations, because the vast majority of the songs have a fantastic beat.  I'm able to get a good 45 minute workout without repeating a single video.  The fact is that she really knows how to put together the makings of a great dance song.  The crazy thing is that there are a couple of songs that never really became popular that I really love.  As far as I'm concerned this is highly recommended if you love to dance.",1109808000,8,590,4.327272727272727

1925593,4,B0000DJZ83,"In this DVD are some great and unforgettable music videos like ""If You Had My Love"", ""Waiting For Tonight"", ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" and others; but in a DVD with great videos, must be bad videos; Jennifer made the awful mistakes of making videos and songs with rappers and hip-hoppers, except ""Jenny From The Block"" (that is a great song!), but songs like ""Feelin' So Good"", and the remixes for ""I'm Real"" and ""Ain't It Funny"" shouldn't have ever had videos! And don't buy it if you want to see the ""Baby I Love U!"" music video, because, no offending to Jen, it sucks! That's just Jen moving on the bed and running through the house. As herself said, ""...to make this video you just need a camera and you know...me, that's all..."".

If you like songs like ""Play"", ""I'm Glad"" and the other singles, go ahead and dont' be afraid to buy it. I'm not saying it's a bad DVD, it's a great DVD, actually, there are just about 3, or 4 videos I personally hate. 4 of 16. Great DVD. Go on and buy it.",1106179200,4,991,4.2712765957446805

I love it when an Artist (That you like) put's all of their videos on one DVD) I just pre-ordered Britney Spear's and I'm excited about it! If you like Jennifer Lopez and think that her videos are Hot than this is the DVD for you. The Sound is excellent! I always have to turn down the volume when I put it in. And they do a lengthy interview for each video she has done which is interesting to hear.

P.S. I heard someone say they wish they could go to the song they wanted to see instead of FW through all of the songs to get to it. I don't have this problem. I can skip to any song I want really fast?! Maybe my DVD remote control is different than others?",1097452800,2,757,3.9802631578947367

the 16 (!) videos are top notch productions, with excellent cinematography and production values.. the image transfer from Sony is perfect, no loss in video quality..
The interviews, with MTV's Sway, reveal a little about what went into each video as it was created..
The remix EP is really good, especially the house experiments..
Jennifer Lopez is a great talent, and I hope she continues making dance music and doesn't go all the way Barbra Streisand/Ballads, which is what she's hinting at..",1090108800,,675,4.827586206896552
1925597,4,B0000DJZ83,"After 3 CDs + 1 remix, and she has put out a comprehensive DVD and EP of remixes for the fans. It's not comprehensive (the original ""Waiting for Tonight"" and ""Baila"" are left off, so don't trade in ""Feelin' So Good""), but that's pretty minor. The 5.1 surround works best on the ""Waiting For Tonight"" remix, which bounces around the room. It's a great DVD that you don't have to watch and just put on and listen to. Some of the videos are familiar (If You Had My Love), some overplayed (Jenny From the Block), and a few that didn't get much play on MTV (Alive). The Herb Ritts video (Ain't it Funny, the first version) should be compiled along with the other videos he managed to do before he passed away. The commentary is with one of the MTV VJs at a mixing console, talking about the making of's and showing the outtake footage. Fortunately, you have the choice of taking that out altogether and playing the videos back to back. There's not too much else in the way of extras otherwise. But as far as music video collections, this is one of the better ones out there. It's not ""everything but the kitchen sink"", but if you like her music, you'll play it as much as you have your CDs.",1088726400,,1185,4.342342342342342

WAITING FOR TONIGHT has to be the best of J.Lo's videos...with AIN'T IT FUNNY running a close second.  While I like the fact that you can play all of the videos back to back, on the other hand, I don't like not being able to select which video I want unless I fast forward through them.  I think EPIC could have added a play all or play individually feature.  The menu is really good too....and the picture is very crisp and clear....and the sound is very sharp.

1925604,5,B0000DJZ83,"NEW JENNIFER DVD + EP ""THE REEL ME"" !!!
Jennifer does it again!
J.Lo One More Time Surpriend me!
Jennifer Lopez has released The Reel Me, her brand new DVD containing ALL of her music videos! The track-listing runs the gamut from Jennifer's first video, ""If You Had My Love,"" to her latest video, ""Baby I Love U!"". The Reel Me also features extras including commentary on all the videos from Jennifer herself, plus a bonus EP featuring brand new remixes of ""Baby I Love U!"" including one by R. Kelly!
THE CD/EP:
The DVD disc is accompanied by an audio-only CD/EP that compiles five excellent remixes of the most popular songs from the latest album ""This Is Me... Then"", and original album version of ""Baby I Love U!"", totaling 32'56'' in length. It's also her second remix effort following 2002's ""J To Tha L-O!: The Remixes.
The EP includes the R. Kelly remix of the hit ""Baby I Love U!"" which humorously casts Kelly's thuggish raps about ""rollin"" with ""some fine females"" against J-Lo's heart-on-the-sleeve declarations of passion. Also featured is the Seismic Crew Latin Disco Trip mix of ""Jenny from the Block"", turning what was already an insanely catchy song into an absolutely undeniable, booty-shaking dance-floor romp. Any listener who enjoyed ""This Is Me... Then"" will certainly want to pick up ""The Reel Me"", as the tracks here present alternate versions that are often even more fun than the originals.
CD Tracks:
1. Baby I Love U!(Album Version)
2. Jenny From The Block(Seismic Crew's Latin Disco Trip)
3. All I Have(Featuring LL Cool J)(Ignorants Mix)
4. I'm Glad(Paul Oakenfold Perfecto Remix)
5. The One(Bastone & Burnz Club Mix)
6. Baby I Love U!(R. Kelly Remix)

THE DVD:
The DVD collection of all her videos is where things get interesting, and that's hardly surprising, given that J.Lo has what it takes to be a video artist.
From ""If You Had My Love"" to her latest video, ""Baby I Love U!"",Lopez proves that she's a true natural in front of the camera.
Even better is the sound, which is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound English! (No subtitles)
In between each video is a brief interview where she discusses the singles and videos. She doesn't reveal much in the way of juicy details, but it's a nice addition to the whole package.

Jennifer I' Love You and I will support you for ever!
J.LO FANATIC! FROM GREECE/ATHENS.
This DVD is great and she is wonderful! Buy Now !!!",1077840000,41,3275,4.903284671532846
1925605,5,B0000DJZ83,"This has got to be one of the best collections of music videos ever!  When it comes to making videos, J-Lo is up there with Madonna and Michael Jackson.  Her ideas are fresh and it stays in you mind long after the video has gone off the radar.  All the videos that she's made are amazing, but the one that stands out the most would have to be ""If You Had My Love"".  The concept, visuals, dancing, etc. were all just great!  The millenium dance party in the jungle of ""Waiting For Tonight"" suit the song perfectly.  Also, ""I'm Real Remix"" and ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" has such a great urban, down to earth vibe.  And Jennifer isn't afraid to flex her acting muscle in ""No Me Ames"", ""All I Have"" and ""I'm Glad"".  The commentaries before each video gives the viewer some insight into what J-Lo was feelin' at the time and how she comes up with the concepts and ideas for her videos.  Also, Jennifer isn't afraid to speak about issues like Puffy, Chris Judd and Ben Affleck during her commentaries.  The DVD also comes with a remix CD featuring tracks from Jen's latest album.  The CD is not all that great, in fact, the only songs worth listening to are the remixes of ""I'm Glad"" and ""Baby I Love You"" w/ R. Kelly.  This is a must have item for die hard J.Lo fans and casual fans alike.  The only flaw is the packaging, which is pretty flimsy and easily damaged, but that's aiight!",1077062400,5,1376,4.307392996108949
1925606,4,B0000DJZ83,"Mr. Buckley is right, she has no talent as a singer, and an actress maybe (will see) but she's got a great moving a** to show off the world and that just happened to make this DVD a perfect dance video collection.  So ""What?"" (To quote her word in that break of her video I'M REAL.)
The Puerto Rican chick also happened to make her name officially international in this business after IF YOU HAD MY LOVE. I mean come on, how many of us really knew how to spell Jennifer Lopez after watching the fearless sweaty brownskin jungle girl in the once-big thriller ANACONDA? Or the sensational life story of SELENA?
DVD is business so this DVD is for business. However, WAITING FOR TONIGHT (Hex Hextor Remix) and I'M GLAD are not bad videos after all. The former was a great millennium countdown party backdrop screen and the latter is ironically the best ""copycat"" video I've ever seen. ""You want to copy something you better do it exactly not a little here and there..."" I admire her for saying that, she seemed not pretentious about it. And she can afford to do it because she's as great as Jennifer Beals (FLASHDANCE, 1983) as a dancer.
We need quality ""fleshdance"" like Jennifer Lopez in this business, every now and then. Not many artists can do it loud and clear. Not Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears or Pink.
So, just in case Mr. Buckley wonder why the hell I gave her 4 stars, well all the credits then go to her strong will to be herself (as she already emphasized a few many times in the interview), ignore the whole world's prejudice and dance!

1925608,1,B0000DJZ83,"J. Lo: to quote the title of one of your movies, ""ENOUGH!""
Okay, first of all, I hate to use someone else's line, but Jenny makes some of the worst music on the block. First, the entertainment biz was given a black eye from which it may never recover by those imbeciles The Spice Girls, and now our pal Jennifer Lopez or Jenny or J. Lo or JN.LO or j. 623<LPZ or whatever the hell she calls herself now decides to:
A.) Release generic, annoying, redundant pop trash (and collaborating with mental midgets like Ja Rule...'nuff said),
B.) Make movies that have all the merit of The Anna Nicole Smith Show,
and C.) Nauseate the American consumer by having her and that talentless hack Ben Affleck's (I liked him in the Kevin Smith movies and Dazed and Confused, but thats it) faces plastered all over every magazine in the country with this whole 'Will They Or Won't They?' schtick that got old two years ago. Bleccchhhh. Wow, a generic Friends episode come to life! *sigh* And now she's tainting the shelves of media stores everywhere with her new DVD/CD, ""The Reel Me"". Whatsamattayou? Didn't they teach proper grammar and spelling in elementary school? Now it's going to sell a bajillion copies to giggly, mentally-challenged 13-year-olds who listen to Good Charlotte and watch The O.C. And it will be that same group of individuals who will find this review ""Not Helpful"". Watch how fast I care...wake up, America, ""Jenny From The Block"" should have stayed there, because she has no talent.
Gee, I can't help but wonder how many ""Not Helpful"" votes this review will net me...",1073606400,2,1575,4.7101449275362315

1925610,5,B0000DJZ83,"In terms of content, the DVD version is exactly the same as the VCD version. This is dissappointing, as at a minimum, the DVD could have at least provided subtitles/lyrics.
The so called 'Commentaries by Jennfier Lopez' is simply the collation of the individual comments Jennifer Lopez gives before each music video.
Nevertheless, this deserves 5 stars as it is a complete collection of music videos done by Jennifer Lopez and it also comes with a bonus music CD.",1072915200,2,463,4.8734177215189876
1925611,4,B0000DJZ83,"I had my speculations of whether to be buying this DVD or not as I wasn't too fond of Ms. Lopez that much but when I bought it I can say that it was worth my $15AU with nearly 2 hours of music videos & interviews in-between them that's not to mention the CD as well with some great remixes.
Anyway with the DVD when I bought it I didn't expect any extra stuff like that and I was thinking it was would just be playing the music videos one after another but I was really surprised that there were interviews in between each music video discussing about it and showing some behind the scenes of some of the videos, this to me was a big surprise and was like an extra bonus. While the DVD is awesome I do have one complaint, why isn't the original video for Waiting For Tonight included on this DVD? That's not to also mention the Baila video isn't included in this as well. I guess Jennifer must've had some say in putting this DVD together on what videos she wanted on this DVD as she seemed very fond of the Hex Hector Remix video for Waiting For Tonight more than the original & Spanish version.
Alive was a touching song and it was nice to see the music video put on this as well since this song was a US release only but the best video to me on this DVD has got to be Play, that was one awesome video, the Ain't It Funny Remix Video Featuring Ja Rule comes as my second favourite, she looks ghetto fab in that vid.
As another reviewer said the songs are edited but if you switch to the 5.1 audio track you can listen to the uncensored version of Play & Ain't It Funny Remix however the audio for Play in 5.1 channel sounded absolutely horrible and the background music could hardly be even heard which I decided to stick to the other audio track.
Onto the CD I haven't played it as much as the DVD but there are some great remixes on it especially Paul Oakenfold's remix of I'm Glad & Bastone & Burns club mix of The One. R. Kelly's remix of Baby I Love U was a surprise to me but it didn't sound that good, the only songs that I didn't exactly mooned over were the Big Brovaz's mix of I'm Glad & Ignorants Remix of All I Have.
This DVD is a must have for J.Lo fans and to all the other people who like her videos, the DVD alone is well worth the money but it's great to also be getting a CD with some remixes of her present songs.",1072569600,,2334,4.054112554112554

Many people have been waiting for this.
It's totally worth the money, partly for including all the videos Jen has ever done. (exept some)
And all the remixes are just top quality, fantastic dance songs!
All the menus are absolutely beautiful.
And It includes making of photoshoots, interviews and other stuff..

I hope that artists such as Madonna, Mariah Carey, among others, develop projects like this one...And thanks JLo! for not including Let's Get Loud in this antology, that's why this compilation is superb and I give it 5 stars!!!",1071619200,,570,4.490384615384615

now on to the Dvd/Cd
After 16,17 videos I THINK its safe to say she is an expert of makeing top quality videos. Her vidoes are always happy, glossy,sexy,original and true. This Dvd/Cd is an excellent piece of collection for anyone who likes jenny.lo.  my only complaint is with the baby i love you video she could have done a lot more with, i hope she aint running out of ideas!!
The cd section is also a nice treat. its like j 2 tha lo the remixs prt 2!
J.lo you are a talented artist and i respect you. Keep Up the good work and no matter wat happens ill alwys b you #1 fan.

1925618,4,B0000DJZ83,"There is not too much to complain about this DVD\EP from Jennifer Lopez. As mentioned already, all of her videos are on the DVD along with commentary. And as we all know, you can't get enough of J. Lo dancing in a video. The DVD alone is worth the price you pay. Although I was a little dissapointed with the EP remix CD, it is a nice addition to the package. All of the songs are remixed from her latest CD. I don't know why Baby I Love U the album version is included though. Basically out of the 5 remixes (not counting the album version) most are club remixes that are generally OK. But the last track, Baby I Love You (R Kelly remix) is really HOT! I would almost pay the price of this package for that one song! It's really awesome, of course it's because R Kelly is a genius (Pied Piper of R&B!!!!!!!!!!)",1071014400,,811,4.171974522292993
1925619,5,B0000DJZ83,"Jennifer Lopez's new DVD/CD is now available and trying to make up for the weaker then usual sales with the 'This is me...then' record. Honestly all 4 of her singles from that album are real good...why such a floppy sale ammount? Don't ask me. This DVD has 16 videoand the CD has 6 new tracks from her latest record and they were remixed too so fans will be happy with the new...work? Yeah, she's falling careerwise with music, but she's still a damn good actress and music video chick-she's only 33, so I think she'll make more videos and CDs soon, but, eventually, she'll realize her voice is just a touch above Britney Spears and Mandy...eew. I ain't hatin', she's hot and her songs are good, and her videos are great, but we all know acting is what she does best. She's a pretty good singer, but I just don't see her as a long lasting music icon like Madonna or anyone in that range. I really love and respect JLO and if I ever got to know her I'd tell her that her music is great, because it is, it's just not as successful saleswise as her movies...but this DVD realy makes me think twice about her music career, these videos are all great...and she's so real...let's hope she succeeds. Anyways, This DVD is great and hope yall check it out!",1070409600,,1247,4.379310344827586
1925620,3,B0000DJZ83,"Jennifer Lopez is the perfect example of a video artist.  She has looks, she can dance, she makes visually appealing videos,  but she doesn't have a voice.  Think an updated (except without as many catchy songs) version of Paula Abdul.
In this, you get the complete 1999-2003 video collection.  Despite what you think about her music,  this is a stellar video collection.  From the amazon Y2K trance of Waiting For Tonight, to the playful innocence of the original I'm Real to the homage to Flashdance in I'm Glad,  J-Lo has become someone who has made the most of a video, mostly probably because of the acting career.  Outside of the dance mix to I'm Glad, nothing on the cd does much for me, typical by the numbers r&b and dance-pop,  but the Oakenfold mix of I'm Glad is great.
Whether you like or dislike J-Lo's music is irrelevant, she's an artist (and the word is loosely used) where the quality of her videos blows away that of the audio counterparts.  If you're a fan of the music video medium,  this belongs in your collection, because no matter what you think about her music,  she has great videos.",1070409600,,1110,4.5786802030456855
1925621,5,B0000DJZ83,"Ms Lopez has finally done something in her favour once again. After the slightly lackluster performance of 'This is Me...Then' it is good to know she can recover from her slight career dips and pack a punch as hard as the next female singer. While she is no Christina or Mariah voice-wise, I can safely say she has picked up many tips from her acting and films and mastered the art of music videos to a tee. Instead of just making the same kind of party music videos over and over again she varies each song and its theme well, and chooses a suitable style of video for each song. Her DVD videos in this vary from the electronic internet themed 'Play' and 'If You Had My Love' to the more classy 'Ain't It Funny' , and the more Bronx orientated 'I'm Real (Remix)', 'All I Have', and 'I'm Gonna Be Alright'. The only downside to this I suppose is the contradicting 'Jenny From The Block' which is probably her weakest song/video, but one she can be forgiven for.
Jennifer Lopez is not as down & out as some people may think and this DVD proves it. A classy, clever collection of her hits, proving that in the age of Beyonce and the Butt Dance she can still hold her own well.",1070150400,,1174,4.292792792792793
1925622,5,B0000DJZ83,"Jennifer Lopez has an eye for the visuals, and her videos are star-studded epic productions that elevate the song to new heights!  Here we have a DVD that contains every J-Lo video from her first ""If You Had My Love"" to the latest ""BABY I LOVE U!"".  It serves as a visual greatest hits package!  Also included is a 6 track ep with some recent remixes of tracks on THE REAL ME.
Someone mentioned the videos were edited for adult content.  I've never seen these videos in any other form, so I am not sure they were ever shown unedited.  Yes her topless scene in JENNY FROM THE BLOCK is edited by fuzzing, and they bleep a curse word here and there ... but all videos start off as MTV friendly in Jennifer's world.  But they are still provocative and edgey!
Commentary consists of interview clips - not exactly a scene specific audio track.  So don't let that catch you by surprise.  No Easter Eggs or any other special features, but you get exactly what you want - Jennifer's best visual representations of her songs!
Whole lot of shaking going on!  Great DVD!",1069632000,3,1058,4.4404145077720205
1925623,5,B0000DJZ83,"On the DVD you get EVERY video Jennifer Lopez has ever made in some form or fashion.  From IF YOU HAD MY LOVE up to her latest BABY I LOVE U! they are all here - though one or two are the remix versions that you saw in clubs.  Whatever you think of Ms. Lopez - it's the videos that shine!  It's like a greatest hits collection with all the visuals.  There is also an EP which has 6 tracks included.  The commentary is not traditional.  It's all done in interview form with Jennifer talking candidly about the song and the concept of the video.  Yes, MY LOVE DON'T COST A THING was aimed squarely at Puffy Combs.  She also admits Chris Judd had a lot to do with ALIVE, and that Ben Affleck was instrumental in JENNY FROM THE BLOCK!  There are tons of surprises about each video - like for I'M GLAD Jennifer and her staff actually raided the wardrobe left over from FLASHDANCE!  You can watch the videos alone, or interspersed with her comments.  She's become a Latina Madonna - pushing the edge of sexy and groundbreaking with each video.  No matter your take on the song itself the visuals win you over!  By the end of the DVD you realize that despite sentiments like I'M REAL or ""Don't be fooled by the rocks ..."" there is an artist working here to give you an illusion of a ghetto fabulous megastar who seems as at home in the hood as she does at the cosmetics counter at Sachs 5th Avenue.  The J-Lo revolution was televised, and here's your chance to own every shot fired by La Lopez!  Stylish, sexy, and always entertaining!  This is the way to experience Jennifer.  The whole thing seems more personal than any movie she could ever make.  And let's face it, I'll take this over GIGLI any day of the year!",1069545600,4,1709,4.304075235109718
