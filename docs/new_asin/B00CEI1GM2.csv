These episodes are not only very educational, but they are fun to watch. We enjoy the surprises of Mr. Wizard's experiments right on the screen.  Our whole family enjoys watching these, and they are much better than a lot of the garbage on cable and satellite TV nowadays. In almost every episode I have seen something that made me say ""I didn't know that"", these are educational for people of all ages.  I highly recommend these for anybody that enjoys quality programming that is also educational, too.",1473724800,2,650,4.725663716814159
8580861,5,B00CEI1GM2,"I bought this DVD set, for my nephew, as part of an ongoing investment in his education. I remember this show from when I was a kid from 8-12 years old. One of my parents household rules was that my brother and I would have to include a total of 1 hour of educational tv programming. We watched 3-2-1 Contact, Sesame Street, Square One, and various other shows but this was one of my favorites. Whenever my family went to the museum in the city, or in another state, I got super excited at the chance to recreate some of the experiments Mr. Wizard did on tv. I would highly recommend this DVD set for children in elementary or middle school, ages 8-15, if you want them to be educated, entertained, and enlightened.",1470096000,4,715,4.383458646616542
