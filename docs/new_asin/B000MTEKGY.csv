2747513,5,B000MTEKGY,"I have never been a devotee of St. John Bosco, but when my in-laws bought the movie, I wanted to watch it with them.  It is wonderful!  I really enjoyed this movie.  I cannot comment on its accuracy, as I do not know enough about the saint to know if the movie is true to his life.  That aside, this is a great film, and will inspire an love for this Saint of the youth.",1177027200,29,370,3.8933333333333335
2747514,4,B000MTEKGY,"Una hermosa pelcula sobre el santo que dedic su vida a la educacin de los jvenes y a ensearles a vivir una vida de fe y oracin por medio del trabajo cotidiano y el aprendizaje. Su frase ""estad alegres"" es un fiel reflejo de su personalidad y su amor por la vida.

Lstima que la pelcula no presenta la otra parte de los acontecimientos extraordinarios que le sucedieron, como el milagro de la multiplicacin de las castaas, la historia del famoso perro gris que lo protega, el papel de Mara Auxiliadora en su vida y sus luchas contra el demonio. Inclusive un mayor detalle del sueo que marc su vida a los 9 aos y los acontecimientos que evidenciaron la santidad de Domingo Savio.

De todas formas es una pelcula que vale la pena disfrutar y sobre todo reflexionar sobre el papel de la sociedad en apoyo a los nios y adolescentes necesitados.",1176163200,,839,4.477124183006536
2747515,5,B000MTEKGY,"St. John Bosco has always had a great appeal to me ever since I was a boy. And this films just captures the man's real, profound love for God, for people, and for life. Especially his true compassion and empathy for outcast youth, tough street kids in Turin, Italy. Bosco had no father himself growing up, and it no doubt helped him have a special understanding of the pain these outcast kids felt as he did everything he possibly could to help them build lives that were happy, productive and closer to God. John Bosco had a lot of opposition from secular society and even within the Church in his efforts to build a facility to house and educate these kids. But he had a very creative mind, a great talent & imagination for inspiring youth, tireless devotion to their needs, and a deep, unshakable trust in the love & mercy of God. Flavio Insinna does a fabulous job in portraying all these unique qualities of St. John Bosco, and this film has a very authentic feel for the period with the sets, locations, costumes. The rest of the acting is uniformly excellent, including performances by Charles Dance and Lina Sastri. The kids in the film also do a fine job, and the overall result is a captivating epic film on the life and mission of one of the most appealing saints in the history of the Church, St. John Bosco.",1175558400,47,1320,4.481327800829876

2747553,5,B000MTEKGY,"This film does a great job with understanding Don Bosco's heart and mission to the young.  It would be wonderful if the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, whom he also founded, had been included!  The only drawback is the English pronunciation of the names of the people and even the Congregation itself.  Otherwise, it gives an accurate view of the times and the people of the times though some names have been changed and a number of persons/times/situations have been rolled into one, obscuring a bit of the historical time frame or personages.  There is no way that any one film could cover all the numerous aspects of Don Bosco's work for the Lord and Mary Help of Christians!  Flavio Insinna gives a spectacular performance and the other actors and actresses really capture the people they represent.",1432684800,2,809,4.833333333333333

2747567,4,B000MTEKGY,"Saint John Bosco Mission To Love is an excellent bio-pic. Flavio Insinna does a great job as the cheerful, yet determined young priest. Insinna, by the way, played on the long running Italian series Don Matteo and was enjoyable to watch in that production as well.

The main problem was with the quality of the picture. It seemed to be just an average transfer to DVD. Maybe they used a smaller spaced disc, but there were too many pixelations which sometimes could be annoying.",1424649600,3,478,4.690476190476191

2747572,5,B000MTEKGY,"""Saint John Bosco: Mission to Love"",a 146 minute Italian TV movie starring Flavio Insinna,is the best biopic about the patron saint of the youth.

Saint John Bosco was an Italian Catholic priest, educator and writer of the 19th century. He put into practice the convictions of his religion, dedicating his life to the betterment and education of street children, juvenile delinquents, and other disadvantaged youth and employing teaching methods based on love rather than punishment. This TV movie captures the essence of his man who dedicated his life for the young.

Aside from the him,the TV movie also presented Saint Dominic Savio and Blessed Michael Rua,students of Don Bosco. Overall,it the TV movie presented how he influenced the youth from turning to evil ways and lead them into living good lives. Flavio Insinna did a great performance on his portrayal of the Saint.

2747580,1,B000MTEKGY,"This movie was a disappointment. there is a problem of failure to understand the teaching and true identity of saints and heroes.

Wonderful!!!!  Can't say enough about it.",1378080000,,322,4.482758620689655
2747582,5,B000MTEKGY,This is a wonderful film that depicts the sanctity and charism of St. John Bosco from his youth to his death.  It is sure to inspire and uplift viewers to live the Catholic faith authentically in service and love of others regardless of background and character.,1377993600,,262,4.695652173913044
2747583,4,B000MTEKGY,"This Italian-made movie about Father John Bosco (Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco), known as Don Bosco is brought to life by a wonderful performance by Flavio Insinna. Don Bosco was an Italian Roman Catholic priest in 19th century Torino (Turin)who lovingly and unselfishly dedicated his life to the treatment, education and support of street children, juvenile delinquents, and other disadvantaged and abused youth.  The movie sheds light on Bosco's early life, family and struggles with the governmental prefect (Charles Dance) who was envious of him and his social work.  The film also sheds light on the role that Don Bosco had in assisting Countess Maria Domenica Mazzarello in founding the Institute of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, a religious order of nuns dedicated aiding and housing poor and homeless girls. In the movie, Don Bosco is confronted with so many roadblocks from the government, the church and rich society that he made his own way to serve and educate society about the plight of these children.  Where no organization or resources existed, Father Bosco founded the Association of Salesian Cooperators, with laity to serve the poor, published the Salesian Bulletin that has grown into an international publication, and trained men and women to carry on his work after his death.  I found this movie to be reverent and touching because of the manner in which paid homage to a man without an ego.  Don Bosco employed love where only harsh discipline had been used before. His method was based on Saint Francis De sales teachings became known as the Salesian Preventive System.  This is a warm and beautifully-acted film of piety, humility and service.",1374192000,3,1678,5.105839416058394
2747584,5,B000MTEKGY,I lent this to the Salesian sisters for summer  Oratory for kids --it was much appreciated.  I recommend this for anyone who would like to learn about and better understand Don Bosco,1373760000,,182,4.65625
2747585,5,B000MTEKGY,"I bought dvds for all friends and family; it is such a great movie, on the secular level as well as on the faith level; the acting, directing, are superb - as are Flavio Insinna, a great star, and the woman who played his mother.

2747592,5,B000MTEKGY,This movie is in English and Italian audio with Spanish and English subtitles. The movie is an accurate portrayal of on of the most beloved of Catholic Saints.  This movie shows what it truly means to live the Gospel.  Most of us have listened to the Gospel but are not brave enough to live the Gospel to the fullest extent always thinking of our own interests.  This Saint Bosco is an example of selflessness in love of Christ and neighbor.  It is wonderfully made and shows that youth need Christ and direction in their lives through Priests and holy people who serve as examples of heroic faith and love.,1360454400,2,607,4.541284403669724

2747594,5,B000MTEKGY,"I do like faith based movies if they are well produced. But I had a guy friend that I was doubtful would enjoy this. It is not typical guy action film. But he loved it!! He loved it so much he even told people about it at the office. I loved it too. It is very inspirational. It is a movie that you can never forget. It makes you long to serve other people with love and good cheer. I am not Roman Catholic but I have to say that St Bosco is one of my favorite saints. He was an amazing person and if there ever was a saint surely he was one of them. The movie is produced well and I did not feel that quality was lacking. You have the sense that you would really enjoy meeting St John Bosco, a man you could relate to, and come away with a new and better perspective. He was a very practical and generous man.  I highly recommend it. I would give it six stars if I could. I like to watch this during Christmas time not because it is a Christmas film but because it embodies what Jesus Christ came to do....live His life through us so we could be more like Him, so that our lives glorify God and serve others with love and good cheer. Make it part of your family library. I don't think you could possibly dislike this film if you like faith based movies. And as I said my friend was not really into this sort of film but this film he loved and raved about!",1358553600,2,1356,3.967032967032967

2747601,5,B000MTEKGY,"This is the kind of movie that Hollywood would rarely make.  Its the kind of story that we rarely hear these days.  And, for just these reasons, this is the movie that you should see!

You have a young man growing up in Italy in 1800s.  He does farm labor, does not have a lot of money, but seems to have a talent for school and all things intellectual.  He decides to study for the preisthood.  Once he becomes a preist, he has a rare selflessness about him.  His sole interest, is helping the poor boys of the street, which were quite plentiful during this time period in Italy.  He forgives those who are viewed as criminals by society and is the sole voice of those who nobody cares about.  He puts his own reputation and position on the line time and time again, he teaches the Christian faith and the gift of literacy to the impoverished children who were often seen as outcasts and criminals.  It was very hard for him to secure any support or resources to help these children, and he faced obstacle and obstacle.  These obstacles even included the hierarchy of the Catholic Church at times.  But he never gave up.

This movie can be quite striking.  Its rare that we pay any attention to this kind of man anymore.  In modern society, we have become so pampered that it is strange to see the tale of someone who is willing to do anything to help those around him.  John Bosco is the kind of role model that our society needs, but rarely comes across.  Those who made this movie should be thanked for telling this tale and giving the world a well-made film about such an inspiring man!",1276128000,2,1591,4.375426621160409
2747602,5,B000MTEKGY,What a great movie to see a priest do so much good for so many impoverished children.  Such a beautiful story of how we are all called to love and what God can accomplish if we surrender to this love and follow the true calling of the heart.,1265414400,3,241,4.020833333333333
2747603,5,B000MTEKGY,"A very uplifting and inspirational movie about one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. I'd also would like to add the the product description above that the DVD has two audio versions (English and Italian) as well as subtitles (Spanish and English), a behind-the-scenes featurette and a 16-page collector's booklet with study guide and film photos.

Hope that helps.",1264377600,10,382,5.161290322580645
2747604,4,B000MTEKGY,"Flavio Insinna was very convincing as a saint. Superb acting on his part. Most times the arts just don't get it right.  The purity, courage and innocence of a saint shines through. Any time you need a nudge on your road to holiness watching this movie gives you the boost you need.  The movie is a bit primative compared to top grossing american films and the child actors are amateurs to say the least but it makes the movie all the more sincere. I believe the movie is in another language and it has an english voice-over.",1234396800,3,524,4.391752577319588
2747605,5,B000MTEKGY,"As a traditional Catholic, I HIGHLY recommend this film. I was a bit worried about a St. John Bosco film because he is always tauted as an anti-corporal discipline and more liberal Saint, but my fears were not fulfilled. It is an excellent story of a wonderful priest who had a great love in his heart for teenage boys and girls on the street. It is VERY well done, not cheesy at all, the acting is wonderful, and I would say it's one of my favorite Saint movies at the moment. Is extremely family friendly even though it deals with some tough items. For that reason you will have to explain a few things to your younger children, but I had no issues with my toddlers and 5 year old watching the film. If you are real particular about violence than you may not like it, but it is not gratuitous, it is necessary to the film, and it's not explicit. The light romances between some of the boys and girls are light and are not focused on, and the story of redemption and love in this film is one that will remain with you for a few days. Very good!",1223251200,15,1045,4.203980099502488
2747606,5,B000MTEKGY,"Flavio Insinna is the consumate actor.  In this movie he gives a tear jerking performance as St. John Bosco, creator of the Salesian Missionaries.  Insinna makes you feel his pain when he tries to get help for the boys in his charge.  He stands up for each and every one, even if they don't deserve it.  Another A-1 performance in my opinion by Italy's best actor. Deserves an award.",1217376000,4,383,4.507246376811594
2747607,4,B000MTEKGY,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I didn't pay attention to the fact that it was a series.  It took 3 nights to watch it.  I found it very well done though.  I always put the captions on with the English speaking. It was a little distracting that the captions did not match the English translation.  Kind of humorous, actually. I would still recommend it.  I would especially recommend it to youth groups.  A good example of love in action and spending our lives for the Lord.",1206662400,4,472,4.4186046511627906
2747608,5,B000MTEKGY,Great movie about a great Catholic saint. I learned a lot about St. Bosco from watching this movie. Definitely a must see.,1205971200,4,122,4.590909090909091
2747609,5,B000MTEKGY,"A delightful 'feel good' Italian TV film made to celebrate the 1988 Centenary of Don Bosco's death - but don't worry, it is 'dubbed' into a quaint form of transatlantic English. Ben Gazzara gives a wonderful performance and looks uncannily like Don Bosco. Friends of the Salesians and aficianados of 19th century Italian politicians will find themselves looking for resemblences between the other actors and historical characters: there are many and they're all good ones, so it has all been carefully researched (watch out for the bearded Oratory Bandmaster Buzzetti, and John Cagliero both as boy and Bishop; although he's not credited there is even a St Dominic Savio lookalike!) The central love story is fiction and overly saccharine but the two lovers are easy on the eye, and most of the film is actually based on fact. At 20 years old the film does look a bit dated now (did labouring boys in 1850s Turin really highlight their hair and have it cut in the Modern Romantic style? We doubt it!) but don't let it put you off. This DVD would probably annoy theologians, but it should have a place in every true Catholic household. The cast of Italian boys steals the picture, and Don Bosco probably would have been happy with that.",1205107200,7,1235,4.775700934579439
2747610,5,B000MTEKGY,"This DVD is outstanding! One of my favorite saints, St. John Bosco had a simple vision of helping other fatherless boys similar to himself. The plot of this film is perfectly paced with multiple adventures and keeps you in rapt attention despite its length. My children absolutely LOVE this movie and watched it twice in a row when they first saw it. The actor who portrays St. John Bosco does an excellent job. I cannot recommend this highly enough! Ignatius Press has another hit!",1202428800,7,482,4.75
2747611,5,B000MTEKGY,"At first, I was intimidated by the length of this video, 200+ minutes.
We are all so use to 90 or 120 minutes in the theaters. Having watched this production, I really feel like I know Giovanni Bosco as well as, if not better than, most anyone I know. My life is, clearly, enriched by having had this introduction. The web of his influence has affected my outer decisions as well as having touched something deep within my soul.",1202428800,5,428,4.430379746835443
2747612,2,B000MTEKGY,"I bought this movie because Don Bosco is one of my favorite Saints and I have read his life many times. I was very dissapointed. The one  point that I found very good is that the actor (Flavio Insinna)fitted exceptionally well the image of this great man. I must say though, that once I started the movie, I realized that it was done in a way that would not raise controversy. The movie is very long (210 min.) and is divided into two segments. I watched the first one trying not to fall asleep and as I finished, I realized that none of the most incredible things known about this man, were even told. So, I hoped that maybe they were reserving the best for last, and saved it for the second part. Sorely dissaponted. There is very vague (if any) mention of any miracle, barely any mention of his incredible dreams and all the graces that he was given, were hidden. He was a phenomenal Saint, he had prophetical dreams, he had the gift of mind reading and he performed incredible miracles!!!! YES! He w-a-s a Saint for goodness sake!!! not just a good man with great intentions!. The producers of this movie seemed to forget that there are requirements for a person to be cannonized and it is not just about being a great human being!. I felt this movie was done trying to please everybody...rather than showing what a Saint really is made of. Don't get me wrong, it does show St. Bosco's incredible faith and goodness, but if you are looking for the real story of his life....this is NOT it.",1201564800,51,1493,4.429090909090909
2747613,5,B000MTEKGY,This is not what I expected...I didn't expect to get touched the way I did when I watched it on EWTN today (11/3/2007). I'm buying it right away so I can show everyone else...absolutely beautiful movie... a tear jerker for sure.,1194048000,8,228,4.585365853658536
2747614,5,B000MTEKGY,"We purchased several Catholic themed films last year; some were okay, some were very dull.  Saint John Bosco was a wonderful surprise!  Firstly, this film is beautifully acted by people who radiate joy and love!  Don't even think about using the English dubbing!  The characters are in their voices and you'll love them right away.  Second, we watched this film over several evenings because we wanted to savour the wonderful story.  We couldn't wait to continue again the next night!  Finally, this was a wonderful example of Christian principles lived out.  We were completely inspired!  This movie is a must for youth groups and families.  Anyone older who has lost their zeal for the faith will get a lot out of it as well!  Enjoy!",1190505600,43,735,4.8
