8252101,2,B0013LSLQU,"I didn't watch this the whole way through. After a while I got tired of Ed constantly trying to sell me stuff from his website after telling me that he wasn't trying to sell me stuff from his website. Maybe it got better, I don't know. There was so little substance in what I did watch that I didn't bother. The things I did see covered are typically sent home with you in any ""new puppy"" kit when you adopt a dog from a rescue or packets that you can get from any big box pet store. If you've never had a dog or a puppy before, this may be helpful, but there's no magic here. The same info is available all over youtube or at your local library.",1468195200,,646,4.015503875968992
8252102,5,B0013LSLQU,"I have been a Leerburg VHS customer from the early 1990's and have now become a DVD customer of the newer Michael Ellis stuff he produces. In that time,I had 3 different dogs, some very biddable and soft temper and some with a more dominant personality.  I think as a Schutzhund enthusiast, I find a correlation between a dominant dog and dog with good ""fight drive"", but it was the ideal sport dog for me, but not easy to handle for other members of my family. So this tape speaks not only to the primary master/handler of the dog,but to the family as a whole.  I think that  you need a dog that the entire family can handle.

Whether you have a ""sport dog"" or a regular house-pet-dog,if you've had more than one dog in your life, you know there is a wide spectrum of dominance in dogs and in different breeds. Some people will simply never require this tape.  Others,I feel will. Most dogs (not all), want to please, and want to be obedient Most dogs are soft and gentle in nature and require a softer hand. But there are many ""bunny huggers"" out there, that think any correction or any set of rules is not appropriate. They then create a problem situation with a dog that wants to be the leader, and you then end up with problems.  I think that you need to understand Ed Frawley's videos not in ""one-video-is-all"" there is to it method, but as part of a spectrum of video cassettes he makes. You have to first respect the man who admits his methods and philosophy has changed. He used to teach with food reward and ball reward, but with drive-compulsion-drive method.  He admits himself that he was originally closer to the old ""yank and crank"" methods of Koehler, and Winifred Gibson methods, which are more militaristic and get results more quickly, but with compulsion based methods rather than reward based methods.  But you have to respect his knowledge. He offers free pod-casts, has hundreds of articles and takes time out of his busy schedule to answer hundreds of emails. You have his method clearly distinguishes OBEDIENCE training versus PACK structure, which is the proper role of the family pet in the human family hierarchy.  Too many people feel that corrections are cruel, combined with food and reward based system only. It may work for some dogs, but some dogs need a firmer hand. It's up to the individual owner to decide the kind of dog he has, and learn that.  The purpose of this video is to setup the puppy for success. By not letting the puppy make mistakes, and being on a leash, and crate trained and not allowing to chew on furniture, and so forth, a clear set of rules is established. Now, I would argue that this video is more about the  ADULT rescue dog that has entered the household, or a household with an ADULT dog that already is having respect issues, rather than a puppy raised from the ground up by that family. For the puppy stage,he has a separate tape on that called ""Your puppy 8 weeks to 8 months"". I would also argue, that Ed has a very commanding and authoritative personality that clearly comes across and the dogs he has owned and trained probably knew that, because each person gives off that aura. However,the average pet owner never encountered a truly dominant dog like the one I had, and I would argue that these methods are for the person that doesn't know how to project authority. It' as much about a mental attitude as it is about training.

This is not a rehabilitation tape. It doesn't offer specific steps on food aggression, dog fights, dog-to-dog aggression versus dog-to-human aggression, or resource guarding of food, toys, or showing snarling teeth. It's not going to teach you how to solve these issues once you have them. Instead, this tape is a general purpose tape for the dog that was over-humanized and you might get 16 stitches and now don't know what to do. This tape is more about prevention then rehabilitation, unlike Cesar Milan's videos where he goes into more details on rehabilitation. However, since Ed is not there in person with you and can't recommend a general ""one-size-fits-all"" approach not knowing your specific problem, he sets up a tape that is more a ""problem prevention"" tape, if a dog starts to show rank, before it becomes full blown resource guarding, or aggression. This is the tape you get BEFORE you go that far, not after. So this tape is aimed at the dominant dog, that is still in the early stages , and how to put him on a program where you curb it, right before it starts. It's not about the soft, well mannered gentle dog that wants to please at all cost. It's about the dog that is either un-familiar to the owner, that came from the animal shelter (and may have been surrender for aggression issues), the dog in a multi-dog household with rank fights between the dogs, or the teenage dog not knowing its place. It's more of a prevention tape, then how to deal with a dominant dog tape. It's at the START of the issue tape, not an AFTER the issue has occurred tape.  He has hundreds of free articles on his website on resource guarding, dog fights, preventing bites in children and so forth.

If you're looking for a puppy tape, this is NOT the one. If you are looking for an obedience tape, this is NOT the one either. This is a no-nonsense practical approach for the dog owner whose dog is starting to show ""rank drive"",or desire to be the leader. This tape is best understood as part of an overall ""context"" of tapes in a larger training series. It's not able to viewed as a ""stand-alone"" tape, if one does not have the overall history of Leerburg videos and earlier tapes. It might seem too militaristic to some,but in general, it has a lot of practical advise, and the owner should use their own head and adopt a method that works best for their own dog, their own constitution and their own circumstances. But it is a methodology and an attitude that is helpful for the dog owner experience respect-issues with their dog. This video is aimed at the dominant dog that the owner is learning how to control. It accomplishes that goal very well. As long as you understand what the the tape-is-not,you will appreciate the for what it is. This tape is long, but it accomplishes the goal and in the end, that is what you're looking for: how to get the goal, rather than have a dog that will end up in animal shelter and get euthanized. It's well worth the money in saving an animal's life if it simply means an adjustment in the owner's attitude or getting a behaviorist (not a dog trainer) that has seen tough dominant dogs and knowing what to ask.",1409616000,,6556,4.530853761622993
8252103,2,B0013LSLQU,"I really really wanted to like this video. I watched ALL 4 hours of it. But now I cannot believe I paid more than forty bucks for this. I was looking for ways to help incorporate my new dog into the family with kids. The cover of the DVD is so misleading. Not even 10 minutes of this video deals with kids and family dogs. I also cannot believe this video is 4 hours long. It does not need to be that long, and so many segments are redundant and slow. I got maybe 3 pieces of decent advice about owning a new dog. Not worth the money at all. I won't be buying any more of these videos.",1402704000,4,585,3.9243697478991595
8252104,2,B0013LSLQU,"Ed Frawley may be a great breeder, but he's a poor teacher of the subject of this video. This 4 hour video may have a lot of useful tips, however, its poorly organized, boring, repetitive delivery make it a poor investment of time or money.

The essence of the first hour is: dogs are either leaders or followers, you need to become the leader, here's the old-fashioned way Ed does it; it works, and BTW, here's the gear I sell.

Mr. Frawley demonstrates by example how a low energy, tentative owner can use some tried and true methods to slowly explain to a dog that he is its ""leader"".  He does this by locking up the dog in a kennel/carrier until it acts like a beaten prisoner, taking it out only to relieve itself and for loose-leash exercise walks until it submits and learns that the ""leader"".Until then he withholds any form of approval to establish that he controls access to all forms of freedom and pleasure.  This may work, but this isn't how dog that aren't in captivity establish pack order, it's how prison wardens used to do it.

Ed's technique isn't physically abusive; but it is mentally abusive. It's an inefficient psychological technique that prison wardens started to abandon after the 1940's, when B.F. Skinner's' operant conditioning techniques proved to work far better - provide an oportunity to exhibit desired behavior, then reward it.

A better use of your money and 4 hours would be to watch the videos ""The Dog Whisperer"" 2004 Paul Owners 72 minutes, and ""People Training for Dogs"" 2005 Cesar Milan and 55 minutes, and ""Home School: Dogs"" Volumes 1 and 2.

If you want to see how a confidently-ACTING person can establish pack leader role with ANY dog, ""Dog Whisperer With Cesar Millan - The Complete First Season"" (2004), the first DVD provides many examples of re-establishing it with dogs that range from dominant aggressive to fearful personalities when owners have allowed/required their dogs to assume pack leader roles. If you want to see how to extend positive reinforcement once pack order is established through obedience to training, read  ""Reaching the Animal Mind: Clicker Training and What It Teaches Us About All Animals"" Karen Pryor (2010).

But, if you believe that you have no leadership qualities, that its impossible for you to act confident and stand proudly IN FRONT OF A DOG, AND you are unwilling to go to a dog trainer/behaviorist for help, then you need to do 3 things.

First, admit that you've made a mistake; you can't keep that dog. Rather than dumping your problem on a shelter or unsuspecting friend or stranger, if its a pure-bred from a breeder, go back to the breeder.  If not, find a non-kill rescue group that works with your breed of dog.  Either way, your dog will get the re-education that it needs, and a better chance of finding a compatible owner.

Second, read the books ""Self-Improvement 101: What Every Leader Needs to Know"" by Thomas Nelson, and ""ATTITUDE 101"" by John Maxwell.  You'll learn how to act like a leader even if you think that being one is beyond your potential. You may never become a Bill Clinton or a Cesar Milan, but you'll have a better chance of getting a raise or a better job (most businesses value employees who act like they know what they're doing).

Third, if you can't live without a dog, do enough research to identify breeds suited to your energy level and physical capabilities, and ask a breeder or breed rescue group for help in finding an adult dog of that breed that is already trained, and even less assertive than you.",1348272000,8,3531,4.709415584415584
8252105,1,B0013LSLQU,"As a military working dog handler and a dog trainer myself, I bought this DVD to see the differences in trainers who subscribe more to the dog psychology (pack structure)  mentality, moreso than the dog training mentality.

I found his DVD to be poorly presented (most of it is done in a chair on his front porch), I found him to continuously repeat himself (usually telling you to purchase items he sells and why), he repeated several times to purchase his other DVD's and he continuously harps on dogs ""earning"" privileges, which i believe speaks to a human way of thinking and not an animal way of thinking.  In what ""pack of dogs"" does a dog sit in timeout til he ""earns"" things?  Never.  A dog simply exercises his desires and the pack leader corrects as necessary, which shows the dog his limits.  He advocates no play and continuous crating of your dog until the dog ""earns"" his way out of the crate, which is not really a dog function to sit in a cage waiting to earn something that he knows nothing about.  In what household would I ever go to one of my clients and say ""don't play with your puppy""?  It's not reasonable and while that tactic might accomplish you as the pack leader in the end, there are several better ways to accomplish this than ""socially alienating"" your puppy.  He actually preaches to remove all social stimuli from your dog.  I don't know another handler who would ever advocate removing people and other dogs from their lives...if anything, desensitization by over-exposure to these things works better than no social interaction at all.

He tells you to act ""aloof"" with your dog.  I just found his tactics to be unrewarding enough for the human that I doubt anyone would reasonably practice these things with people like Cesar Millan around who clearly can accomplish the same thing with much more ease.  Absolutely, positively not worth the high price of his DVD's.  I couldn't even get through the entire thing.",1326153600,29,1949,4.67741935483871
8252106,5,B0013LSLQU,"Leerburg's videos are long, but that is because they are full of information and take the time to show you examples of how things are done correctly, but also examples of incorrect methods.  This video is probably best for an individual bringing home a dog that is not a young puppy. This is for someone bringing a previously owned, or adult dog into the home.  It tells you how to go through and to correctly interact with the dog to show your rank as ""Alpha"" .  If you want to learn how to become the pack leader with a new puppy, I would not recommend this video.  I would reccommed Leerburg's ""Your Puppy 8 weeks to 8 Months"" for a new pup.",1299110400,3,644,4.254098360655738
8252107,5,B0013LSLQU,"This dvd is of lower production quality, but packed with years and years of great experience and information.  If you have a situation where your dog does not mind, or you have a multi-dog house hold where problems occur, this is a great starting place for how to live with your dogs.  Also if you have a new dog coming into the house and you want to keep your family, kids and the new dog safe, this dvd is a great place to start.

Most trainers breeze through what it means to establish pack structure, its a process that takes time and patience.  Ed explains in detail.  I have been working with dominant and aggressive dogs for the past 2 years and Ed Frawley is the only trainer who gets it 100%.

Proper pack structure training is more important to a dog than exercise or behavior training.  It's the one thing, that if established properly, can eliminate problems.  This dvd shows you how to do just that.  It could be better, more organized, better production quality, but the information is all there.  Better than and Caesar book or Discovery dog show.",1268870400,8,1062,4.513089005235602
8252108,4,B0013LSLQU,"Ever since I got my german shepherd puppy everything I have heard is ""Its all about leadership!"". Well, before I found Leerburg nobody ever showed me how to do it. No matter what I tried I just couldn't muster up he mystical pack leader quality of Cesar Millan. :)

If you are having any sort of rank issues with your dog this DVD is a great place to start.
If you are about to get a new dog, especially an adult dog, you should definitely check it out.

Each Leerburg dvd has at least one ""ah ha!"" moment.  If nothing else the section in this DVD that breaks down the interaction between two dogs is worth the purchase.

The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is that there is some product placement in the DVD. But to credit Leerburg, the product placements are tied in where the product actually would be advantageous to understanding a broader concept that has been presented, or when a proper tool would be very helpful.",1267574400,6,933,4.344827586206897
8252109,1,B0013LSLQU,"It's a self-promoting infomercial.  Very long and boring, and he's got plenty of stuff to sell.

Might be OK if you were training an aggressive or ""problem"" dog.  For most people I believe this video will do more harm than good.

We got maybe 1/2 way through it.  Do yourself a favor and pass it by.

RECOMMENDATION:  Try the book from Animal Planet, ""Training Your Dog"" by Dominique De Vito.",1261267200,10,392,4.514285714285714
