It's a must see!!,1168819200,3,291,4.407407407407407
2484768,5,B000E267B0,"I really like this movie, it is sad how everything they work for was taken away from them.  The screen writers did a wonderful job with this movie.  I have a friend who is a screen writer and I now know every movie that was ever made a screen writer had to write it. And maybe more than one helped write it.  I also love the actors and actress that played in the movie.",1422057600,,369,3.9594594594594597

2484771,5,B000E267B0,"I bought this DVD, because I want to watch this movie so bad, can't get it from netflix, so I decided to buy this one, and add this to my collection",1401580800,2,148,3.806451612903226
2484772,5,B000E267B0,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. If you like Depression era stories, this movie is for you.",1386201600,,102,4.15
2484773,5,B000E267B0,"I had been searching for this DVD EVERYWHERE and I finally found it on Amazon. I was so determined to get it before Pop died (which he has now, extremely unfortunately), but at least he got to see this without it going ""wonky"" in the middle like our VHS copy of it. The only complaint abou this movie is that it doesn't have subtitles, so bear that in mind",1385856000,,356,4.173913043478261

2484775,5,B000E267B0,i happen to be a granddaughter of kathryn messenger.  and know the real facts of what went on. most of that movie was bogus. the truth is they did go to prison for a debt my aunts husband did run up.but in the movie they said when she went in she could not read.sorry she could read very well.another fact in the movie where they have her drinking floor cleaner total bogus she did get sick while she was in there but it wasn't from floor cleaner.the parts that are true are just this they did go to jail the lawyer did help get them out.and the cops did railroad them and my aunt did almost get raped in that home.thanks for having this review because the real truth or should i say some of it is out.,1307059200,2,702,4.086956521739131
2484776,5,B000E267B0,"The Messenger's don't have much as far as material things, but the love they have for each other outweighs anything money can buy. And it's that love that gets them through when they are faced with trials.

It's the 1950's, and the store owner in a southern town gladly extends credit to George & Kitty Messenger (played by Gerald McRaney and Tyne Daly), who promise to pay when the crops come in. Unbeknownst to them, their son-in-law raises their bill and the store owner expects payment by the end of the week. Sheriff Ashford sees this as an opportunity to abuse his authority and get the Messengers - Yankee trash, as he calls them - out of his so-called ""fine"" town of Jackson. He comes up with a bogus charge, and the Messengers lives become a living hell. George and Kitty spend time in jail and some of their children are sent to a foster home, where old man Virgil is a pervert who sets his sights on their feisty teenage daughter (played by Alicia Silverstone).

The sheriff is played by Sonny Shroyer. I remember him from Dukes of Hazard; he played Enos and he was likable. With this role he sure has proved that he can play someone who is rude, prejudice, unfeeling and downright evil; a very unlikable character.

I have liked watching Gerald McRaney's work ever since Simon & Simon, and I have been an admirer of Tyne Daly ever since Cagney & Lacy. If she has ever played a role where she isn't a strong woman who isn't afraid to face her problems head on, I haven't seen it.

My people perish for lack of knowledge (Hosea 4:6) is what comes to mind when I watch this movie. The Messengers were convicted of a crime that didn't exist, because they didn't know that - as the lawyer who pleads their case to a judge puts it - nobody in this country can be jailed for debt. But in the end Kitty gains the knowledge and courage she needs to lead her family back to heaven on earth.

Although there are parts that irritate me, I like Scattered Dreams. The first time I saw it was some years ago on television. When I came across the DVD here on Amazon, I purchased it immediately. And the speech Kitty (Tyne Daly) gives in the courtroom at the end - so touching, so true.",1208304000,6,2181,4.375308641975309
2484777,5,B000E267B0,"I can recall in my times poor ignorant people who were taken advantage of because of their lack of knowledge by greedy money grabbing scabs, and others that had enough power to think themselves some kind of gods over the unfortunate. This movie portrays it quite correctly. I got angry and wanted to see some payback before the movie ended. Not so, but it ended as it should have. Great performance by the leading actors. I will watch it again.",1199145600,5,444,4.5625

8104544,2,B000E267B0,"Tyne Daly is an excellent actress but this film was depressing and not interesting. I guess because the movie was old and perhaps badly produced. It felt like a high school play. I was disappointed even though I liked many of the actors there was nothing that held my interest. Remaining hopeful, I kept watching but no, a story that had potential, just fell apart. Even old movies can be great so I hoped to see a wonderful Tyne Daly film. Her character was not developed correctly. She went to jail, drank lye soap and then learned to read and fought their case in court like a lawyer, the end. Maybe comparing it to a high school play is setting the review too high!",1437868800,,669,4.403225806451613
