8544121,1,B000Z6GT7W,Family is another Miike masterpiece I've only watched it 2 times took it out to watch for a 3rd time and found the center shattered into little pieces. The cases are black and have two prongs that are connected to the center push button and hold the disc on the right and left. The top and bottom are not moveable and are too spaced apart causing the dvd to pop up and resulting in the prongs applying pressure to and cracking the disc in the center. There is no way around this it has nothing to do with how you remove or put the disc in. As consumers we are being ripped off don't stand for it don't buy dvd's from companies who use cases like this.,1353456000,,651,4.133858267716535
