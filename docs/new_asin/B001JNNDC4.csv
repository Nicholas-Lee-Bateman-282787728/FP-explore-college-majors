3658384,2,B001JNNDC4,"Ok. So here we go again with a ""vengeful ghost"" story.

There were just some things that were a bit....inconsistent.

1. How often do you really see a person running through a subway where EVERY SINGLE DOOR IS LOCKED? I understand that they needed a reason to kill the first character to get the ball rolling. But come on. That was stretching it a bit far.

2. Can we really believe that this Dark Force (that was so omniscient that it could turn water into a death trap) who wanted back this nun was not powerful enough to find her in a convent?

It was OK to burn up a couple of hours, but this is not a movie that you will want to see time and time again.",1231718400,3,658,4.077519379844961
3658385,2,B001JNNDC4,"Just saw this movie last night and wow..it was bad. The story jumped all over the place and it went all wrong. It basically involved this guy, who was a cop, and was having family issues. He took a new job, and the mirrors were responsible somehow for problems that were going on. From there, our ""main character"" - goes all around to find answers and save his family.  If the plot sounds confusing to follow, it isn't because my summary is random, it is because that is the way the movie is. Another problem was the music in the film - it totally sounded way too over the top. Another problem was the fact that the movie had like 3 plots happening at once, and not enough time was spent developing any of them.

The DVD was made professional enough, and while the menu looked great with all the bonus features, it wasn't enough to save this mess of a movie.",1231632000,2,858,4.290123456790123
3658386,3,B001JNNDC4,"... but instead it did for Alexandre Aja's stock what the economic recession did for the car industries-- dropped it harder and faster than a hammer onto a sleeping and sexually abusive stepfathers skull.  Much like my aforementioned(and tastless) comparison, Mirrors is such a forced mess that it makes you wonder just what the man behind two of the best horror offerings from the new millenium was going for?  The film tells the tale of an ex-cop(played by Keifer Sutherland in complete Jack Bauer of TV's 24 mode) who takes a night security job at a burned up department store.  We're not talking about just any run-of-the-mill Macy's here though, it's got a grisley and mysterious past!  You see, during one particularly ""creepy"" Fall sale, the store decided to sell mock-neck sweaters under the false pretenses of being full turtle necks... AND ALL SALES WERE FINAL!  Okay, maybe the movie isn't THAT bad, but it's plot from this point on is about as compelling.  In actuality it turns out that the store was built over the remains of a mental hospital accustomed to shady going-ons(are there any other kind?) and it's up to our anti-hero(he's a pill and alcohol abuser and generally bad husband and father, hence the ""anti"" before the ""hero"") to figure out what's going on before his life completely unravels.  From here on we get some great and genuinely unnerving moments involving the mirrors in the building, unevenly split with some extreme(and excellent) moments of grue.  Here lies the films main problem-- direction.  Not direction as in how it was filmed(Aja can shoot a great looking movie no doubt), but rather; direction as in where it's going and what it's deal is exactly.  Is it a ghost story, a demonic possession film, a slow-burn haunted house tale, a brooding mystery?  Oh it's all that and more!  The thing is, it's not only highly noticable everytime the movie does a 90 degree turn and reinvents itself, it's also jarring(including a Hollywood style, action-packed, CGI-laden final showdown that's pretty lame).  Calling Mirrors a movie(singular) would be a mistake, because it's actually movies(plural) rolled into a watchable but ultimately unmemorable 110 minutes(even though 109 of those minutes feature Keifer screaming at inanimate objects, which never gets old!).  2.5 stars, not one of the worst horror films of 2008, but far from one of the best(here's to Alexandre Aja bouncing back with his next offering Piranha-- although it is his 3rd remake in a row?!).",1231372800,3,2496,4.997584541062802
3658387,3,B001JNNDC4,"A former NYPD detective Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) is hired as a security guard doing a night shift at a ruined department store that burnt down five years ago. Ben, still traumatized by one tragic accident, starts to see weird things there at midnight. And those things have something to do with mirrors that still remain in this dilapidated building.

The story of ""Mirrors"" may be based on a Korean film made in 2003 named ""Geoul sokeuro"" (which I haven't seen), but the thriller's touch is definitely that of Alexandre Aja, known for his ""High Tension"" and the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes."" Remember that his latest film as director includes more than one gruesome (and gory) death and some disturbing images.

Unfortunately it seems Alexandre Aja is not interested in other parts of the film. Though the images of the run-down New York department store and its interiors (actually shot in Romania) are very spooky, ""Mirrors"" relies on a familiar tactic to scare you such as sudden big noises. Yes, I jumped in the seat several times, I admit, but this is not exactly what I had expected form the one who directed ""High Tension.""

I am not perfectly sure that ""Mirrors"" was really the right choice for the director. The mysteries surrounding the mirrors and the strange visions Ben has are not very interesting. In fact Ben doesn't have to think much to get the answer. Besides, the film shows only half-hearted effort in its protagonist's character in spite of Kiefer Sutherland's energetic acting. I couldn't understand why he had to be so obsessed with these creepy mirrors when all he has to do is just quit the job.

The film is not bad as some people say, but not great either. I hope Alexandre Aja will do better next time.",1231113600,,1741,4.717105263157895
3658388,1,B001JNNDC4,"First, just let me say that I am BAFFLED by all the positive reviews I've seen for this movie...are you people on drugs??

I was SO excited to see this! It looked really great...and now that I've seen it, I want my damn money back!

It started off good enough. The first half hour, 45 minutes or so...but then it went totally down hill. The story could have been great if they'd left it alone and stopped trying to add in all these different back stories that were REALLY unnecessary. It made me feel like I was watching 3 or 4 different movies at once...like they couldn't decide on a plot. And in the scenes where our lead goes to Pennsylvania...I almost lost it. I could not stop laughing at how awful these 2 or 3 scenes were. On EVERY level. The acting, the dialogue, the overall things that happened in these scenes...RIDICULOUS and unrealistic.

And the acting...the acting was AWFUL. By everyone! Paula Patton is, by far, one of the worst actresses I have EVER seen. She should NOT be allowed to speak...EVER. Even Kiefer Sutherland, the lead, did a pretty horrific job. The old lady near the end and Amy Smart were the best, believe it or not. It was just VERY hard to care about ANYONE in this movie.

Back to the plot...there were like 3. Its like they couldn't decide where to take it, so they took it EVERYWHERE. Why not just decide on ONE plot and ONE story and try to make it really great? I guess that would be too easy. They've thrown in so much, I almost forgot what I was watching. It was so choppy and uneven and it had NO flow. The ""twist"" ending (which is apparently identical to the original korean film) could have been good, but they did nothing to offer ANY explanation as to why or how it happened...it just created another plot hole, therefore, it didn't work at all. There were a few things I did enjoy, a few of the effects with the mirrors were pretty cool...just a FEW...most were terrible and cheesy. Very bad CGI.

I can't say that I'm too surprised given that this was done by the same guy who did High Tension (which could have been great without ALL the ridiculous plot holes and horrid ending) and The Hills Have Eyes remake (which was just awful in general. WAY too over the top and just a bad, ugly, gritty movie). Given that, Mirrors just never had a chance. Its no wonder to me why it seemed to just pop up out of nowhere, it wasn't screened for critics (which is SUCH a bad sign), and I strongly believe that if they hadn't found a decent, subtle, creepy way to market this movie...it would have gone directly to DVD. It should have.

Overall, I think this movie probably started off as a really great idea...as do all remakes of asian horror films, but, like all those other films...it went VERY wrong. Mostly because the writers seemed to have no self control. Everything but the kitchen sink, right?

I saw 3 people I knew as I was walking out of the theatre and I convinced them to see something else.

I suggest you all do the same.",1230681600,13,2980,4.376130198915009

3658391,5,B001JNNDC4,"Angela Carson: Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben. That's it. There's nothing behind them.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Ex-cop Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland) is forced by necessity to take a job as a night watchman at a Department Store that has been gutted by a major fire.
2. It doesn't take him 24 hours to find out that something's not quite right with his new job
3. Sure enough, he soon learns that the Department Store was once a totally different type of institution, and that the man who burned it down had also killed his own family.  Strangely enough, the large mirrors in the building have all survived the destruction.
4. When the hallucinations start, Ben starts digging around, and discovers a clue - the word ""esseker""
5. No prizes for guessing that something evil lurks in the mirror world, and soon Ben's family become targets.
6. It's up to Ben to find a way to save his family, and his time is almost up.

This is a creepy, gritty sort of horror flick that will have you thinking twice about looking into the mirror, even if you've never before been able to pass one by without checking yourself out.  A bit of gore here and there adds to the drama, but the spine-tingling bits occur in the quieter moments.  The ending however, isn't so much anticlimactic as understated.  Recommended for folk who like to get their creep on.

Ben Carson: You gotta be careful of the water, it creates reflections!

3658393,2,B001JNNDC4,"So, how about them Mirrors?

The phrase I'll use to describe it is kind of clichd anymore and I know I've used it a few times in reviews, but when the hat fits you, um, well you wear it. So the phrase is: The total is not greater than the sum of its parts. I can't think of a better, concise way of explaining it. The Mirrors, despite having some terrific scenes and one or two harrowing sequences, just isn't a good movie.

Based on a Korean film (Into the Mirror), Mirrors teams Alexandre Aja with his screenwriter pal Grgory Levasseur and, unfortunately, the results aren't as pretty as I expected and hoped. I love Aja as a director. He completely caught my attention with Haute Tension and continued to throttle me with The Hills Have Eyes remake. Last year, he helped P2, a decent, if kind of mundane thriller that he didn't direct, but he did produce and co-write it. So, when I heard he was directing Mirrors, remaking yet another Asian ghost flick, I was cautiously optimistic.

Unfortunately, what starts off as a promising film turns into a run-of-the-mill remake of an Asian ghost film, instead of TV/phone/computers/camera, we have mirrors. Instead of some creepy Asian girl crab walking down stairs or slouching through a TV screen (or, hilariously, hanging onto the back of a protagonist), we have an American girl who is reaching out from the mirrors (or not...it's not quite explained) and murdering anyone she can...for no apparent reason except to somehow convince those she's murdering to get her out of the mirrors.

Like I've mentioned previously, Mirrors does have some fantastic scenes. Everything that takes place inside the dilapidated department store is pitch perfect and some of the imagery is very reminiscent of Silent Hill; the sequence involving Kiefer Sutherland walking down a dilapidated long stairway, equipped with solely a flashlight is pretty good. And there's a scene involving a dressing room and mirrors that started off perfectly, but went on a bit too long.

The signature piece of the movie, though, hearkens back to Aja's style. In Haute Tension it's decapitation by dresser. In The Hills Have Eyes, it's the terrifying sequence that ends with an American flag in the head. In P2, it's death by being crunched slowly into a wall by a car. Here, it's...well that would be giving it away. But it's amazing in its intensity, gruesomeness and Aja's unwillingness to look away while it's happening. It made my friend's stomach churn. Even though I had read about the scene in other reviews, I still watched in horrific awe at what was happening.

Unfortunately, the last half falls apart (and becomes a pseudo-monster movie at the climax) and I completely lost interest. You know how it'll go before it even starts; when the death threats get personal, the hero will have to do investigation, locate the cause of the haunting and find a way to stop it...haven't we seen this before?

I have one last thing to say. At the beginning of the film, Kiefer looks into a mirror at the department store and see behind him a door slowly opening. When he looks at the door, it's closed. But, in the mirror, it's opening. At this point, Keifer walks to the door and goes down the dark staircase. If he didn't, there'd obviously be no movie.

But once, just once I'd love to see the following scene:

INT. DILAPIDATED DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

Ben Carlson's flashlight illuminates a full mirror. He's about to continue on his rounds when he notices movement in the mirror. The door behind him CREAKS open in the mirror. He turns to look at the door. It's closed. Back at the mirror: it's sliding open.

3658415,4,B001JNNDC4,"I had low expectations for this movie, so I was very happy to find them exceeded. Viewers should be advised that ""Mirrors"" isn't the all-out gore-fest type of movie that seems to be in vogue in Hollywood these days; rather, it is more of a slow burn, taking its time to build up to an explosive finale. There's nothing particularly original about the plot. Washed-up detective Kiefer Sutherland is on the rocks, thanks to an officer-involved shooting, a broken marriage, and a substance abuse problem. Desperately in need of work, he takes a job as a night security guard in the burned-out shell of what was once New York City's most prestigious department store, where the only things that are in a state of repair appear to be the many mirrors that are still mounted on the walls.

Not to give away any more of the plot, but the creepy ambience builds and builds. Sutherland's character finds himself growing increasingly unstable, finding it difficult to tell the real world and illusory world apart. Then the deaths begin, some of which are fairly graphic, particularly in this unrated version (a woman ripping her jaw away from her face is incredibly well done). CGI is well-used and relatively understated, being a supportive element rather than the center of attention. Sutherland puts in a characteristically solid performance as the lead, which stands out slightly from the rest of the cast, who all seem to be phoning it in (I'm looking at you, Jason Flemyng, with your dodgy American accent). By the time it's all over and the dust settles, there have been enough chills, jump scares, and plot twists to keep most viewers happy.

3658447,1,B001JNNDC4,"Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland) is hired as a night watchman while waiting to be reinstated by the NYPD. He begins working in an abandoned warehouse in an attempt to piece his life back together, however, something just isn't right. He notices that the mirrors in the place are a little too clean. He soon realizes that there's more to them. -summary

 I remember very carefully coming into Mirrors for at least two reasons; 1) I am not a fan of Alexandre Aja. To me, the guy has a very hard time telling a story and he usually runs behind either cheap gimmicks or excessive gore. 2) I heard that this movie is a remake of a South Korean film. Even though I haven't seen the original, I'm very aware of how often the mark is missed and the remakes are usually screwed up. Even with low expectations, Mirrors still didn't really amaze me and it was indeed missed potential.

 As a fan of the supernatural I was intrigued by the films premise, which deals with the myth on alternate worlds behind mirrors. In the hands of a director with talent, Mirrors could have done for reflections what Jaws did for the beaches, and that's make you think twice about coming within a mile of them. Immediately during the opening scene, Aja pretty much lost me by relying on the all too familiar early brutal death. From there, it was pretty much by the numbers.

 The plot follows Ben as he's harassed by what appears to be an evil, and very violent entity residing in the dimension behind the mirrors. He's tormented in different ways, and the longer he takes to piece things together, the angrier this apparition becomes as it attacks his family. One thing is for sure, the spirit means business as the viewer will quickly learn.

 The audience is introduced to Ben's problems. His family is delved into as well and although the situation is fleshed out, it just seemed to distract from the inital story which is clearly the more interesting of the two. To me, Aja had an idea but he just really didn't know what he had, and as a result, the entire story in regards to the mirrors ended up as another gimmick. He really should have studied Jaws and took notes on how to build tension, along with a Nightmare on Elm Street, as that film took complete advantage of its element, by stressing the importance of sleep and the hazards of losing it. He could have done a whole lot here if he truly had an imagination. Unfortunately, the main storyline feels underdeveloped and there are smaller elements completely lacking any type of information. It's completely unclear on how come Ben and the guys before him were chosen by the entity in the mirrors to carry out its demand, while the older security guard was never approached. And although the ending may have some scratching their heads, I feel it was just another weak attempt by Aja to make himself out into this brilliant film maker in which he clearly isn't.

 Mirrors isn't truly bottom of the ocean, as it does feature some good performances, and the commentary in regards to schizophrenia and demonic possession had some interesting moments. However, for some reason I just can't shake it as mere window-dressing. Perhaps it's because the inital story feels so poorly executed. There were some good set pieces and there were stylish moments. The gore on the other hand appeared a little too fake, and I've seen films from back in the 80's that looked far better.

 In the end, Mirrors is something that I would like to forget about. It rarely moved me and it just feels like a lackluster project. After I saw Jaws, swimming in beaches didn't feel the same for awhile, after NOES, it wasn't that easy to sleep, after watching Mirrors... well... I was shaving the next day with the sharpest blades. So I guess that says everything.

3658490,2,B001JNNDC4,"Kiefer Sutherland is one hell of an actor to bring to a film, just as long as he's able to leave his Jack ""24"" Bauer  character at the door. In ""Mirrors"", Sutherland is in full Bauer mode and it's noticeable at times and takes you out of the movie a bit. The acting overall isn't anything to brag about and while the set up to this premise was very interesting, it lost its way the further it got and ended up very sloppy by the end credits. Cheap scares, lazy script writing, passable acting and plot holes that include a twist ending that doesn't make much sense besides to throw a twist in with a horror movie. Fans of the actor and popcorn horror flicks with some good gore might take something away from this but as for me, I doubt I'll see this films reflection again. D+",1428364800,,777,4.25

Kiefer Sutherland is one of my favorite actors (like father like son), although I think Kiefer is actually an even better actor than his father Donald.
This movie really succeeds in conveying a seriously HAUNTED and SPINE CHILLING atmosphere.
Plot development is kind of weird, in fact it's kind of over the top (not too much) but it does work.
It's hardly the most original of premises but then again what is, seriously, everybody copies everybody else to some degree or another, but the psychological and terrifying atmospheric elements are so well done.",1415836800,2,609,4.809523809523809

The film is about a man who goes to work as a security guard in a building. He suddenly starts to realize that the mirrors in the building are haunted, and the spirits are trying to use the mirrors as a gateway into his family's home in order to do them harm.

This movie is pretty scary in some parts, and it has scenes and images that can easily disturb some people. But all in all, it's a pretty well made, well acted, and cool movie.

3658591,5,B001JNNDC4,"""Mirrors"" is great! This is how the story goes: It's been nearly a year since volatile detective Ben Carson was suspended from the NYPD for fatally shooting another undercover officer, an accident that not only cost him his job, but fueled the alcoholism and anger that has alienated his wife and kids and left him crashing on his sister's couch in Queens. Desperate to pull his life together, Carson takes a job as a night watchman at the burned-out ruins of the Mayflower department store, which was destroyed by a massive fire that devoured numerous innocent lives. As Carson patrols the eerie, charred remains of the store, he begins to notice something sinister about the ornate mirrors that adorn the Mayflower walls. Reflected in the gigantic shimmering glass are horrific images that stun Carson. Beyond projecting gruesome images of the past, the mirrors appear to be manipulating reality as well. When Carson sees his own reflection being tortured, he suffers the physical effects of his fractured visions. His sympathetic but skeptical sister Angela dismisses these bizarre ""nightmares"" as a consequence of his stress and guilt over the accidental shooting, but Carson's estranged wife Amy, a no-nonsense NYPD medical examiner, is less forgiving. Her husband's increasingly erratic behavior frightens her, pushing his family farther away--and, she fears, it's putting their children in danger. As Carson investigates the mysterious disappearance of a Mayflower security guard and its possible connection to his ghastly visions, he realizes that a malevolent, otherworldly force is using reflections as a gateway to terrorize him and his family. Carson must somehow uncover the truth behind the mirrors--and convince Amy to help him battle the greatest evil he has ever faced.

The cast led by Kiefer Sutherland (as Ben Carson) is excellent! The directing by Alexandre Aja (who also wrote the screenplay, he also directed and wrote the screenplay to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006), & also wrote the story and screenplay and directed ""High Tension"" (2005), he also produced and wrote the story and screenplay to ""P2"" (2007), he is also produced and directing and writing the screenplay to ""Piranha 3-D"" (2009) is excellent!

The music by Javier Navarrete (who also did the music to ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006, which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Score) is excellent! The cinematography by Maxime Alexandre (who also did the cinematography to ""High Tension"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", & ""P2"") is excellent!

3658603,3,B001JNNDC4,"In many ways 'Mirrors' is a pretty creepy film that not only get's the job done, but delivers what you hope for and surprises you as well. It managed to send some good chills down my spine at least half a dozen times. The NY department store makes the perfect set for the freightening sequences that take place in it. The concept alone of a film production team making a film called 'Mirrors' seems totally crazy to even consider, because any camera man will tell you that shooting scenes where there are several mirror angles involved in the same room is always difficult to do without revieling the camera men and crew in the shot. Well this entire film is loaded with so many mirrors and reflective surfaces that it had to be an agonzing experience trying to work around them. I would have probably given this film 3 stars rather than 4, but because of the accomplishment of dealing with these mirrors, the excellent makeup effects, gloriously creepy moments, great sets, and great acting, I felt it deserved 4 stars(a close 3). Kiefer Sutherland(who I am a huge fan of) does in fact not only copy his Jack Bauer character, but he goes as far as to threaten a nun at gunpoint at a monastery to get her to comply. He also threatens torture with someone else to get results. And he reacts to anguishing moments identically to the way he did with his Jack Bauer character in the series 24. He sequences his face and crawls into a ball on the floor, he grabs his head in total pain and frustration while he has his gun in one hand. But because Kiefer is a master at showing deep intense anguish and pain in his character's face, so ""Kudos Kiefer"" I guess. However when he wasn't in his security guard uniform he actually wore the exact same clothes he wears in the 24 series. I mean exactly the same. Keifer looks great in these duds, so somehow I feel a little forgiving of that too. Really liked this film.",1368144000,,1907,4.451428571428571

As the visions transform into a terrifying reality, Ben must unravel the mystery behind the store's sordid past or face the wrath of the restless spirits within. Alexandre Aja's third foray into feature-length Horror is a considerable let down after the smash hits HIGH TENSION and THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake. MIRRORS never presents a consistent canon when it comes to the extent of the spirits' powers. First, it seems that they have the power to posses a person after looking in the mirror, then it seems they can steal the person's identity, entirely. The spirits are able to jump from the haunted location in to any other building with no established rule set, either, and their complete ability to interact with our world is dubious at best. It all seems so convenient and contrived that it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief. Kiefer Sutherland is outrageously over-the-top and can't be taken seriously in the role. Where the mirror motif offered Aja the potential to provide supreme tension and eerie atmosphere, he squanders every opportunity to unnerve the audience by using cheap shocks and excessive gore instead of a creating a slow suspense and creepy mood. The passive observer may take some pleasure in a few unexpected jumps, but it is difficult to ignore the logical inconsistencies and poor plotting.

Those images are the best parts of this movie. And that's not a good thing for one that is supposed to be encased in horror. The problem is that the concept, as presented, is too silly to be scary. It's a movie about demon-imprisoned mirrors, but characters taking it seriously just make you laugh. The last three minutes before the ending credits are actually pretty cool. But by then, it's too late.

3658619,2,B001JNNDC4,"I was at a friend's new apartment, and she hadn't yet bought furniture, so we watched this movie lying on the floor. We got to what I will call the ""bathtub scene"" and I just started screaming. Having no pillows or sofa to clutch for safety in my horror, I ended up rolling onto my stomach and screaming into the floor. My friend, in the meantime, is lying there laughing like a hyena at me. I can only imagine what they thought we were doing in the apartment below.

I am not sure why I had such a strong reaction to this movie. It was gory and extremely graphic, but it was not necessarily unique. It wasn't anything that I haven't seen in multiple other movies. I've seen worse in other movies. Maybe it's the fact that the ""perpetrator"" was invisible that it was so disturbing.

THIS is the scariest movie of all time. Not The Exorcist, or any other movie that is often quoted. The Exorcist may have lost some of its fear factor since I've seen it so many times (that's one of my favorites). Mirrors... I will never watch again. And I will never watch the sequel!

3658620,1,B001JNNDC4,"Now, if you're offended or angered by someone not liking this movie because you DO, save yourself some grief and move on to the next review. If you're considering renting or purchasing this movie, what follows is just one person's opinion.

Impressive production design doesn't necessarily make for a successful movie. Case in point: MIRRORS. Where do I begin? Incredibly amateur dialogue, especially the howlingly unrealistic exposition. It sounds like a first draft, not a finished film script. Capable actors do their best with it but one wonders how they were directed. HUGE plot holes where logic flies out the window to serve getting the hero from point A to point B. Why go on and on about how a character is a fallen cop and then allow him access to all this police information? This convenience reaches new depths in the last half hour of the movie, with its far-from-unique possession cliche's.

After watching a film like this, I wonder why the people behind it didn't just make a video game. Why bother with plot and characters if they're going to be so unbelievable? Have your cool, scary images and leave it at that.

There are some promising ideas here and there. AND some different takes on themes which have been explored in other films. A few ""every parent's nightmare"" parts would've been more effective if the film was a bit more grounded in believability.

I wanted to like MIRRORS. I'd read some good reviews. However, it just made me angry and frustrated. Especially since it uses one of the most embarassingly formulaic ways of resolving a story like this. And a twist ending which could've been heartwrenching had it involved characters I could relate to.",1326931200,,1680,4.843205574912892

Many factors are responsible for the neat and brilliant flow of this film, firstly it's the wonderful cast performance that is enough to glue your eyes to the screen, Kiefer Sutherland simply steals the show and the rest of the cast delivers decent performances.

The other reviewers thought Kiefer Sutherland did a great job acting, but he must have acted only in the last ten minutes of the film, because he did not act any in the first part, and I turned the movie off before it got to the last ten minutes.

Undercover detectives go deep to hide their real nature, and that can create problems when you take a job in a place that thrives on showing you what it sees as your dark self, amongst other things. Carson takes a job in a burned-out building filled with mirrors, mirrors that trap evil spirits. To free the spirits and save his family, he must discover the secrets that put them there in the first place.

This movie is the sort in which each comment seems to require some qualification. Mirrors is a simple movie; much of the story line could have been dropped entirely, not even serving as an effective red herring. The Dorian Gray-like mirrors are suitably creepy, but we are never fully drawn into Carson's world. It's entertaining, but there are no big messages, or maybe the message it tried to take on, about the self in the mirror and the real self, was too big for the movie. Mirrors never wind up standing for anything very interesting. In short, it's a decent attempt, but it feels as though Mirrors could have been something more.",1290816000,,1202,4.723809523809524

I actually enjoyed Mirrors.  The first scene housed one of the nastiest throat-cuttings I've seen on film and immediately propped me up for the film's duration.  Because of this, I set aside any desire for suspense or character development and placed my trust in the violence.  I am, at day's end, a horror fan.  I found the gore in this movie completely satisfying on an essential level.  That's it and that's all I needed.

All the theories and mythology surrounding mirrors made this one look like a really good investment. I suppose it just comes down to taste, however. The use of gore, special effects and injury makeup is so much that many of the supernatural characters and injuries are grotesque. If you're a SAW fan, I'm sure this won't bother you, but I actually did cover the eyes of the person who was with me during the bathtub scene. That was ridiculous, and wholly unnecessary. Overkill would be putting it lightly, and the same goes for a lot of the ""attacks"" on humans. The ending will leave you asking yourself what in hell just happened.

The concept behind it is interesting, but when you finally find out what's going in, you might find yourself scratching your head, wondering how it even slightly makes sense. I understand suspending belief for the sake of entertainment, but I did not find this entertaining. The highlight of the movie for me was watching the cop's reflection smile and take a shot at him.

Final verdict: If you're into gore, outrageous plots and really pushing the limits, this might be for you.

The place they are guarding - an old building that has quite the sordid history and that plays out as the movie progresses. The problem here is that as this plays out, Keifer Sutherland's character finds that the mirrors in the place being to talk to him and begin to show him things, burning things, and ask for a singular word.
and if history is to be taken seriously, those who do not find out the origins of this word end up with dead families, horrible lives, and broken everything elses.

Mirrors had some really great stuff in it, and I found myself drawn to the movie. whether we were dealing with the movie and the turns it takes, the therapy that comes as part of the plot, or the mirrors and what they want, there is always something to be seen. I personally thought some of the effects had a gruesome impact, too, with jaws doing thing jaws shouldn't do and people doing things they don't really want to do. It speaks volume on the power of the place and on what K.s. has to do in order to save himself.
Man, this really isn't worht minimum wage, I have to say.

The plot itself does have some holes in it, and there are times when the movie seems to go too long. I thought that when I saw the DVD version that was listed as unrated but not in the theater variation that I had seen. I also didn't really like the ""threat to the family"" stuff that happens inside the house K.s. and his seperated wife once shared because, really, it didn't have a point. Water - I know it reflects but - you see where this is going. And that was bothersome enough to lose a point.

3658647,3,B001JNNDC4,"What a disturbing movie.  I picked it out knowing it was going to be a horror movie, but some of the scenes were just downright disturbing.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Ben Carson, a suspended police officer who is taking a night job as a watchman for an abandoned department store.  The store is the Mayflower, a once grand place that was destroyed in a fire.  Before that it was a mental institution that specifically took in schizophrenics.  It is filled with large pristine  mirrors on every floor and they look out of place being in such a destroyed building.  He starts his night job thinking that it should be an easy job and hopefully get him back on the right track with his previous job and his family.

It isn't long before he starts thinking he's seeing things in the mirrors that really aren't there.  Closed doors, people, burned images, he trys to shrug it off as a side effect from his medicine but after awhile cannot deny that something strange is going on.  He begins to research diligently trying to find out what is going on and what happened to his predecessor who had been found dead in the building shortly before Ben started working there.  He doesn't find anything definite though and the visions start getting worse and worse and his other senses start experiencing things as well.  He tells his sister, but this ends in tragedy and has him worried about his estranged family.  His wife and kids soon spiral into this mess with him and he must find out what the mirrors want before they destroy his whole family.

At the risk of having spoilers in this review, I must tell you that the way his sister dies in this movie is utterly sickening.  I had to look away it was so gruesome.  While there are other horrific scenes,  this one by far is the worst.  Because of this, I definitely recommend younger children stay far far away from this movie.

I do have to applaud the special effects in this movie.  They were very well done and unbelievably realistic.  With all the different horrors that the mirrors contain, it was interesting to see them on the tv screen coming to life before your eyes.  Some of the more gruesome scenes, despite being disgusting, definitely looked real as well.  There was some music in this film, but I don't really recall it to well so its safe to say its unmemorable.

It was an ok movie I suppose, but I was also very unsatisfied with the ending.  It just seemed unfinished to me.  Definitely not a great movie for sure, but for anyone looking to get their horror fix, it would probably suffice.

3658674,3,B001JNNDC4,"Mirrors (Alexandre Aja, 2008)

I was about forty minutes into the hundred-odd-minute Mirrors last night when my wife, who's down with bronchitis, took some cold medicine and went to bed. I considered turning the movie off and coming back to it today, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Why? Because I was seeing something I had never seen before--a good Alexandre Aja movie. No, seriously--a really good Alexandre Aja movie. (In my defense, when my wife takes cold medicine, twenty minutes later she has no idea whether I'm in bed with her or not. ""Comatose"" is a valid description.) I was expecting yet another stupid Hollywood remake (and with Alexandre Aja having helmed the epitome of the stupid Hollywood remake, the 2006 version of The Hills Have Eyes, I felt entirely justified in this). For the record, I have yet to see the film upon which this is based, the 2003 Korean project Into the Mirror, and maybe that changed my perception a bit. But oh, yes, I was completely immersed in this.

And then we got to the last five minutes. And that Nike I was waiting for clonked me in the back of the head, except by then I wasn't expecting it. Ever since I finished watching the silly thing, I've been trying to spin the ending a different way. Me, of all people, trying to figure out how to defend a film by a guy who, up until now, hadn't even figured out how to direct a good short! (I generally don't review shorts, only rate them; I caught his first project, Over the Rainbow, earlier this year. It got two stars mostly for its brevity.) I think this is a sign of the apocalypse.

In any case, the plot concerns an ex-cop named Ben Carson (Dark City's Kiefer Sutherland--who, let's face it, hasn't done a good film since the beginning of 24). Ben left the force after an incident that messed with his head enough that he fell into the bottom of a bottle, resulting in the breakup of his marriage (he's now sleeping on the couch of his sister Angela, played by Crank's Amy Smart) and a period of jobless wandering through a self-tortured life. He's started picking up the pieces, though, and newly sober, gets a job as a night watchman at a department store that burned down five years ago. (We're told that it's still being patrolled because the company is still tied up in a legal battle with the insurance company.) All well and good, except that ghostly goings-on begin his first night. He quickly finds out that every night watchman in the place, including the guy who originally burned the place to the ground, has had the same problems. You see, there's something wrong with the department store's mirrors. (This is not a spoiler; we find this out in the refreshingly gory opening scene.) Needless to say, whenever he tries to explain the mirror problem--to Angela, for example, or to his ex Amy (Precious' Paula Patton)--they look at him like he's nuts. How to convince them he's not before something unspeakable happens? And what do the things in the mirror want, anyway?

It's always been the case that the decent American remakes, or even the mediocre ones that still somehow manage to be worth watching (Verbinski's The Ring, for example, or Scorsese's The Departed), are based on top-notch flicks. Not to say there haven't been awful American remakes (did you see Bangkok Dangerous? No? Stay that way.), but the good ones? Yeah. So I'm guessing that Sung-ho Kim's original Geoul Sokeuro is a real barnburner, because the first hundred minutes of this movie are, at least for Alexandre Aja, absolute genius. The whole thing is about character and atmosphere. It is, in fact, the second (that I know of) Asian-horror-flick remake to actually get that bit right, and as a result, the film shines. Some of the criticism leveled at the movie has had to do with some bad acting by supporting players, and this is true, but none of the supporting players here gets a whole lot of screen time; this is Kiefer Sutherland's movie, and he carries it. (Some of the other criticisms say he's just reprising his Jack Bauer role. I've never seen 24, so I can't comment on that, but if so, I can see why the show's a hit.) The atmosphere is tense, and more importantly it's believable enough to let the viewer swallow enough disbelief to actually buy the rather ridiculous premise.

And then the final five minutes. Intellectually, I know I shouldn't hate them as much as I did. The ending probably even works in the original (though some of the things I've read lead me to believe the ending has been changed). And for the record, the final shot really is set up nicely all the way through the movie, and if you take it by itself, it's creepy and effective. But my god, the plot hole that gets blown through this movie in the final two scenes is unforgivable--especially because those scenes are right next to one another. It was as if Aja and his longtime writing partner Gregory Levasseur said ""hey, we need one of those endings that sets up for a sequel (ed. note: which is in the process of being filmed as we speak, of course), who cares if it makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film?"". And that's exactly what we got.

I wanted to love this movie. And had I turned it off five minutes before the end, I probably would have. ***",1259539200,17,5254,4.566277836691411

Kiefer & Paula Patton did a great job in this. Amy Smart also has a small role as Kiefer's sister. The effects are good & some are very gruesome.

But fundamentally this is a dark film that strives to make the audience miserable - and succeeds. Even writing a review seems to justify this film, which I detest doing.

Apart from the fact that the plot is flimsy, the characters are 1-dimensional, and there are no redeeming elements, the antigonist is fundamentally deranged in a way that leads to no conclusion nor resolution.

Just avoid this one. It's awful.",1250467200,10,569,4.855670103092783

We learn that the store was burnt out in a fire, fifteen years previously, and many people were killed. As Sutherland takes up his new job, he soon starts seeing disturbing images in the mirrors inside the old building.

I thought this movie got off to a great start. Kiefer Sutherland plays the part of the nervous and troubled watchman very well. However, as other reviewers have noted, the plot does lose its way a bit as the movie progresses. I felt, though, that the story just about manages to hang together, and there are many genuinely creepy moments in this movie. It kept my interest throughout.",1250467200,,721,4.677165354330708

Stories are usually lacking and ""common sense"" seems to make the movie even worse.  Mirrors has a good story and does a good job of telling that story although the split between husband and wife seems odd and misplaced because it is halfway explained (either explaining it more or not at all would have been better).  When it comes to common sense, I don't remember talking to the characters in the movie to do this or do that.  The only things I can see wrong with the movie would be the following:  1) the movie spends the majority of the time building up and then ends pretty quickly, squashing most of the ""fight scenes"" with the ""horror scenes"" in about 10 minutes time, and 2) the ""re-watchable"" factor for me is somewhat low (note:  this doesn't take away from a movie being good but means it's not one I would want to see more than a few times at most).",1250121600,,994,4.34054054054054

Jack's attempt... er, Kiefer's attempt at the horror genre is a pretty satisfying one.

Mirrors is a terrifying movie because of certain tricks that happen to the mirrors throughout the film.  In a few scenes, Kiefer was shooting directly at the mirror only for the glass to ""grow back"" into place a few seconds later, like the glass had never been broken in the first place.

Also, whenever someone who was facing a mirror would turn away, their image would still be marked into the mirror like they were still looking directly into it.  Very freaky stuff like that made the level of terror go through the roof.

Some graphic, bloody scenes also dominated the film, such as one... memorable bathtub incident.  Probably the best part of the entire movie.  Also there was a mystery element to the entire film as Kiefer searched around for clues to try and explain the incident and stop it from killing his family.

Kiefer attempting to get people to believe him about the odd and dangerous evil that lurks inside the mirrors was good storytelling too, because of course, no one believed a single word he said.

Eventually it was figured out that anything that causes a reflection can bring harm to Kiefer's family, and this is when the movie really gets good.

Other than Mirrors, my favorite horror movie was Boogeyman. I am not a fan of gore. I think the best horror movies are psychological and scare you either because you know it definetly COULD happen or because it is based around a subject that has some degree of mystery around it. Mirrors is based around the premise that mirrors are actually portals to another world and are able to control your body. The concept is frightening enough, but their implementing of the concept left me afraid to look at mirrors for several days.

I'm not going to say that the movie is free of gore. There was a moment where I had to avert my eyes because the image before me was so gruesome that I simply couldn't watch. But the moments of gore are few and far between and they aren't the main factor that gives you fear. The film relies on getting into your head and planting fear of an everyday object to terrify you.

3658706,4,B001JNNDC4,"I have to say that ""Mirrors"" was much better than I thought it would be.  Again this movie falls into the unfortunate chasm of movies that only made it the theater for three days.  The only saving grace is that this flick (and other short lived films in theaters) made it to DVD.

""Mirrors"" has a very low budget/B movie/independent film feel to it.  This movie was made in 2008 and stars Kiefer Sutherland.  Kiefer has regained his success (and career) with the television program ""24"" (which is a great show).  It appears that ""Mirrors"" was made during the off season of ""24"".  The only reason I note ""24"" is because Kiefer plays Jack Bauer on this show and in ""Mirrors"" he plays a character named Ben Carson.  I must admit that I found some similarities between both of these characters, this isn't a bad thing.

Ben Carson is a police officer who has been suspended for reasons that aren't totally explained, all we know is he killed a person.  As a result of this suspension his marriage is falling apart and he has temporally moved in with his sister (played by Amy Smart).  In addition Ben is grappling with a drinking problem and some anxiety/depression.  In the wake of all these cumbersome issues Ben takes a job as a night security guard at a mall that was recently condemned.  This mall was knighted with condemnation because it caught fire and almost burnt to the ground.

During Ben's nightly routine at the mall he starts seeing strange things in the mirrors.  Are this things spirits, hallucinations, apparitions or projections of Ben's inner demons? Consequently, Ben's witnessing of horrible things in the mirrors promotes a level of foreshadowing to what might happen to Ben and people that he cares about.  Needless to say Ben is slowly pushed into the realm of madness as he struggles to convince himself and his love ones that some evil is transpiring.

The movie takes some interesting twists and turns, both supernatural and psychologically.  This induces a build up to a climax that strongly reminds me of Dario Argento's 1980 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inferno/dp/B000KRNG5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inferno</a>.  I only watched the ""unrated"" version and found it creepy but a little winded.  In other words, this movie could have shaved off about ten minutes and it wouldn't have bothered me.  The movie had a couple of cheesy moments but it didn't ruin the film for me.  I found that Kiefer provided a solid performance as a ""burn out"" on a path of self redemption.

If you are looking for a creepy movie that is different than you average ""slasher flick"" than ""Mirrors"" is a good choice.  My only suggestion is turn your brain off a bit, because if a person starts to really dissect what they are seeing there going to find some discrepancies.  For instance, if you were working at a condemned mall and saw things in the mirror that no one else saw would you really keep working there?",1237420800,2,2969,4.878243512974052

3658712,3,B001JNNDC4,"I wouldn't exactly say that ""Mirrors"" reflects badly on its producers. It does deliver a few genuine scares, including one really shocking scene involving a woman, naturally, in a bathtub. (It's amazing that any of us ever bathes or goes in a basement, considering the lessons of horror movies.)

However, the hauntings in this movie are a completely implausible muddle. It's no use trying to figure out exactly how, why, or where the avenging entity appears as it does.

Also, the movie doesn't take advantage of its own projected setting. The epicenter of the haunting is supposed to be an old, burned-out department store. There's no accompanying commentary on the disc, so I don't know where these scenes were actually shot. However, most aspects of the store look like extravagant, unconvincing computer generations. If some actual abandoned building could have been found as location, the movie would have had much more atmosphere. This sort of film cries out for its location to become another character in the unfolding action - just as the old, abandoned Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts became such a portentous character in the thriller ""Session 9.""

This film does try to capitalize on the inherent eeriness of mirrors, and on the suspicion many of us fleetingly entertain - that the reflection we see in the mirror has a life of its own. Again though, ""Mirrors"" ends up with less by doing more. There have been a few movies and TV episodes that played on this concept, but that featured reflections that moved just subtly out of synch with their fleshly counterparts. Just this shade of lag time made the reflections truly riveting and unnerving. However, here the reflections go off on radically different tangents. The obviousness of the mayhem they are going to launch detracts from the suspense.

So ""Mirrors"" suffers from too many demonic manifestations that are too flagrant and ubiquitous. Nevertheless, this movie is good for a few chills and shudders.",1235865600,,1981,5.048929663608563

3658717,5,B001JNNDC4,"Quite simply, ""Mirrors"" is the most terrifying movie I've seen to date. What is especially effective is the director's reliance on the viewer's intelligence to put the pieces together to discover the source and power of the evil entity behind the supernatural. A convoluted sentence to be sure, but it properly outlines the struts of the horror behind the mirrors.

Just as in real life, we often do not get information in an orderly manner in a movie. We get bits and pieces which we must order into a reasonable explanation of what is not explainable. So it is with ""Mirrors."" Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) is the connected character, the one with the job in the burned out hull of a previous luxurious department store. Kiefer replaced the previous night-watchman, who appears in the first scene and is destroyed by horrific forces behind the mirrors. That's what I mean by displaced order. What one has to do with the other is the viewer's task to figure out, even as Kiefer does.

The first 30 minutes are slow, even with grotesque violence, but as in any powerful horror movie, the effects must accrue into unbearable suspense. Kiefer exhibits a wonderful mix between crippling fear and strict determination to conquer what's behind the mirrors. His years as a NYPD detective pan out in obtaining information and evidence in tracking the source of the evil.

Every mind-bending revelation of the story of the mirrors adds to the horror. He discovers that a  state hospital for the insane was the original occupant of the site where the burned out department store stands. Experimental testing with mirrors caused the original troubles.

Suffice it to say that Kiefer must find that testing subject before he can save his family. Save them from what? You may not want to know!

""Mirrors"" is a complex film which requires complex reflection (pardon the pun) to appreciate the tangled plot threads of the story. Special recognition goes to the young actor who plays Kiefer's son for his creepy scene toward the end. He had my attention! The weak link is Paula Patton, there just to be a haridan and to overact.

The final scene elicits the greatest terror of all. Again, the viewer must be responsible and competent in paying attention to all the details. If he or she does, ""Mirrors"" is a very rewarding, if horrific viewing experience. That final, haunting scene will stay with you for a very long time.",1234569600,2,2409,4.83252427184466

Finding a position as a night watchman in a burned out NYC department store, he suddenly finds himself facing down an evil force that travels through various mirrors and reflective surfaces. The characters are dull, the special effects are Sci-Fi channel original movie quality, and basic storyline is non-sensical.

***  Out of 5

Release Date- August 15th, 2008

Running Time- 110-Minutes

Rating- R

Screenplay- Alexandre Aja & Gregory Levasseur

Director- Alexandre Aja

Starring- Kiefer Sutherland, Paula Patton, Amy Smart, Cameron Boyce, Erica Gluck, Mary Beth Peil

Upon my first viewing of Mirrors I really didn't care for the movie at all I suppose maybe my expectations were too high; I've been a fan of Kiefer Sutherland since I was 9-years old after seeing Young Guns and now with 24 he's easily one of my very favorite actors of all time and I think Alexandre Aja has potential to be a great horror filmmaker so with these two involved I expected a lot more. But watching Mirrors again I've gained a little more appreciation for the movie; while far from a classic it does serve it's purpose as a fun if not very flawed movie.

The screenplay by Alexandre Aja & Gregory Levasseur for the most part was pretty good; the characters are fairly interesting and are developed a bit as well. While not the greatest characters in a horror movie they are more than faceless characters. There is a good amount of drama added in and actually I think the dramatic elements worked better than the horror. I found myself more interested in the drama and that is where I found the writing to be at the best. Overall the screenplay might be lacking in some spots, but I suppose it's better than most horror screenplays these days.

After bursting onto the scene with Haute Tension, Alexandre Aja I feel hasn't lived up to his potential. While I did enjoy The Hills Have Eyes remake I also felt it could have been better. And with Mirrors he seems to be staying put rather than moving forward. The thing about Aja is that me makes violence really scary. In general when it comes to horror the violence isn't the scary part it's the build up, but Aja is one of those filmmakers that can make the violence really creepy.

With Mirrors Aja does well I suppose; the pace of the movie is good I can't say I was ever bored during the movie, but I found the suspense and tension to be slightly lacking and that is the biggest problem. Aja can make a suspenseful movie. Haute Tension is proof of that. When the killer shows up and starts killing people in the house were some of the most tension filled scenes I've seen in a long time. But since Haute Tension I don't think Aja has lived up to that potential even though he's always right about to reach it. Again Mirrors is never really slow and always moves forward so in that regard he gets the job done, but it's just the suspense and tension lack at times.

Unlike his other movies Mirrors is a much more character driven movie that relies more on the characters and suspense than that of the violence. I think Alexandre Aja does fairly well with the characters and his dramatic scenes are the ones that work best oddly enough, but his suspense scenes don't work as well. Essentially I think the biggest problem is Mirrors is one of those movies you watch then sort of forget. You know those movies you watch and than a bit later someone asks you about it, but you can't remember the details? Well that's sort of what Mirrors was like for me. While I did enjoy the movie the 2nd time around it's still sort of forgettable.

The one thing we know about Alexandre Aja is the man loves his gore and Mirrors while violent is nowhere near the level of Haute Tension or The Hills Have Eyes, but the few gore scenes were quite brutal only brought down by some shoddy CGI. The jaw ripping scene was awesome, but the CGI was a little poor. That is tough to pull off, but Adam Green did in Hatchet without the use of CGI. But the gore was excellent, but the CGI slightly brings it down. I don't wanna spoil anything, but a certain character who was engulfed in flames was some really poor CGI it really looked bad. But despite some suspect CGI the gore scenes were pretty cool and the jaw ripping scene was the highlight.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer um I mean Ben Carson and Sutherland like always gives an excellent performance, but it's as if he made a wrong turn on the set of 24 and ended up on the Mirrors set. Sutherland is pretty much playing Jack Bauer. The final act is where it really shows if you just walked into the room and saw this on screen your first thought would be 24. First thing I wanna say is Jack Bauer is one of the greatest characters of all time and Sutherland plays the role to perfection, but he has a lot of depth and range as an actor and it's a shame to see him reduced to pretty much playing the same role.

Paula Patton as Amy Carson also provides a solid performance and that brings me back to the drama element. I liked the basic idea with the characters even if a little clichd, Ben Carson is the troubled ex cop sort of a broken down man and he is separated from his wife. While we have seen this done plenty of times in all genres, I think it added a lot of depth to Ben and Amy Carson and that's why I said I think the dramatic scenes is where Aja & Levasseur get it right in their writing and where Aja does excellent as director.

In closing Mirrors isn't a bad movie it's never really boring, but just lacks the suspense and tension. Don't go in expecting Haute Tension, but if you don't expect too much you'll probably enjoy the movie. Hopefully Alexandre Aja can reclaim what he did with Haute Tension. But he needs to chill with all the remakes. Mirrors, though makes for a fun time, but sort of forgettable.

The Blu-ray is amazing. The picture and sound quality are excellent, the picture is sharp and the colors are excellent. Of all the BD I own Mirrors easily ranks as one of my favorites.",1234051200,4,5674,4.382492863939105
3658722,1,B001JNNDC4,"The effects are better in Mirrors than in 24, but the plot is the same. In 24 Sutherland tracks down imaginary terrorists to protect ignorant innocent people, and in Mirrors he hunts down the invisible evil spirit in mirrors that are attacking ignorant innocent people--including his family. He plays the same self-centered, psycho-dramatic character who knows he is doing the right thing despite his schizo-paranoid tendencies. He saves the day and the paranoid wacko becomes the hero of the day, yet again. The end. It is not that scary, and the suspense only picks up after approximately 50 minutes into the movie when a storyline actually develops. This is not a movie to see let alone buy, unless you are just as confused as Sutherland and his writers are as to what constitutes suspense and perplexed heroic characters.",1233964800,4,825,4.9855072463768115

To my surprise, it was actually a decent horror film with a neat supernatural element used as the main antagonist. With so many things that can cast your reflection in day to day life, it would be hard to get away from an evil force like the one in Mirrors.

The acting was average across the board. I can't watch Kiefer Sutherland and not think of his character on 24. Amy Smart was barely in the movie, but her death scene is destined to go down in history as one of the best ever in this genre. My jaw still hurts from watching it. That scene and one other at the beginning aside, this film had very little gore, especially for one directed by Alexandre Aja.

Fabulously Eerie with  its supernatural elements, the story brings you through the experience as we come to the final terrifying twist in the story. The disk is made for a 5.1 setup with its great audio, and specifically its ghostly audio that adds much to its spectacularly spookiness. Kiefer's performance brings up a brilliant scare. Its an excellent watch.

3658725,3,B001JNNDC4,"I don't do plot synopsis in my reviews, so just scroll up for that.

This is the newest Alexander Aja film(directed High Tension and remake of The Hills Have Eyes).  So far his films have been about human killers and sociopaths, but this one veers into the supernatural.  He's got the goods when it comes to moody lighting and a good set-up, but he brings along some ultra gorey sequences that were more fitting in his previous films, well there are actually only two in the film, but the second scene of major graphic violence is real grotesque and may turn off those tuning in for simple haunting.  The set-up is basic horror stuff.  Ex-cop(swear, they're always ex-cops so they have easy access to friends with info they couldn't possible get on their own and so they can carry a gun properly), ex-alcoholic takes a night time security job guarding the ruins of a burned down department store in New York.  Sounds like the Shining, right?  Well, it really does, but unlike the Kubrick film, the characters in the film feel real and are fairly fleshed out in their archetypical roles.

Of course like most cinematic hauntings of recent years there's a mystery to solve and only Kiefer Sutherland can do it.  The mirrors are doing and showing him weird things from the store's past.  They etch a name in the glass of a woman he must find in order for the nasty mirrors to leave his wife and kids alone, wife and kids he seperated from of course--this ain't the strong family unit of the Poltergeist days.  The build up works.  Once you find out the answers to the mystery...well...well, things get a little goofy and outside the realm of understanding, even for a supernatural thriller.

*SPOILER TOWN*  Okay, why do the spirits or ghosts or whatever have the power to mutilate and follow you home, but can't simply tell you what they want and why?  Amy Smart, plays Kiefer's sister, didn't really have to die.  In terms of film writing she is playing the Janet Leigh role, but I would have a little animosity towards these spirits if they killed my sister and I would be a little hesitant to help them, bunch of jerks.  I mean,I get it, her violent death gave the threat to his family some suspense but still...  Okay, and how come nobody talks about the fact that this department store was built on the old site of an asylum, isn't it always an asylum?  You think this would be common knowledge, at least on an urban legend level.  FINALLY, like I said before the answer to the film's mystery is totally silly.  These aren't ghosts in the mirror, it's one giant demonic entity looking to go back to its original host body.  Yup.  Stop smiling.  Apparently, a possessed girl was committed there and the doctor put her in a glass room to cure her of schizophrenia.  Why?  Movie doesn't really spend a bunch of time explaining our good doctor's theory on that one, and even less time on why the mirrors sucked the demon out of the girl in the first place.  When Sutherland reunited the girl and her demon(sounds kind of cute) the movie gets even sillier.  Now the nun is possessed again and she is jumping around like a hopped up monkey and fistacuffing it up with our ex-cop.  It's not scary.  It's not believable and its totally hysterical.

Now I like my superantural horror with as little explanaions as possible, but this one pushes it a tad.  Why do the mirrors take the demon from the girl?  Does anyone know the answer from simply watching this film?  I have some previous knowledge about mirrors and their folklore origins involving soul stealing and evil trapping, and so do the writers of this film, but they don't incorporate it into their screenplay at all.  There's a cool special feature on the dvd that goes into mirror folklore, but why should I have to watch a dvd special feature to understand a film?  I shouldn't have to do homework to watch a movie(Yes, I'm looking right at you Southland Tales)!  This is an intriguing folklore idea and transporting it into a modern horror couldn've been a cool and intersting idea.

The acting is all good, without being exceptional.  At this point I think unless Sutherland does a romantic comedy he will always be playing 24'S Jack Bauer.  The effects with the mirros are sometimes creepy.  The atmosphere in the first half is thick and effective.  The logic is out the window after about the hour mark, well as much logic as a film depicting supernatural events can have, but I assure it is possible.  The opening gore scene is unnecessary and ineffective, but really gross--if that's your thing.  It's a solid rental, but a better, ""Hey, looks whats on HBO, Mirrors, I kind of wanted to see that"" movie.  NOT REQUIRED TO BE SEEN BY SERIOUS HORROR BUFFS.

3658746,3,B001JNNDC4,"'Mirrors' is not too different from many a horror film that graced the screens in 2008, with the exception that it had a (sorta) marquee name with Kiefer Sutherland.  That being said, it's a little bit better performed than most of your weekly multiplex scarefests.  That doesn't neccessarily mean it's a better movie overall.

The movie follows ex-cop Ben, played by Sutherland, as a security guard for a burnt up department store/former hospital that is tied up in the courts because of insurance claims.  The setup follows standard issue horror films: It's night, it's lonely, it's haunted..by something in the mirrors.  The scenes in the store provide a good share of scares, and Sutherland isn't as dimwitted as typical horror protagonists.

But aside from acting and some good scares, there's little else going on here. The story has a good setup, as we try to figure out why the mirrors are all haunted.  While the movie tries to serve up an answer, there seems to be holes in the explanation.  In an effort to create a shocking conclusion, the film makers settle for a weak puzzler of an ending that features a big visual goof that provides little closure.  I won't spoil it here, but will say that the ""shocking"" alternate ending doesn't help at all.

Mirrors is a slightly better than average horror film, but it's still going through the motions.  Really, it's nothing more than an excuse to make mirrors seem scare, just as similar films have made basements, phones, and videos forever seem frightening.  If that is its sole purpose, it's mostly effective.",1232496000,,1568,4.853383458646617

I would not say that this is the best horror movie I have ever seen or that this is one of the best horror movies to come out nowadays, but I will say that it is one of the best to be released theatrically these days. I have read a lot of things about this movie ranging from classic to horrible and I have to say that I find this film to be some where in the middle. This was in no part a bad movie in fact it is a really fun watch for those who like these type of films, there are some genuine scares to be had, some good creepy scenes. Plus Kiefer Sutherland and Alexandre Aja together should make for a good movie right?

Ben Carson [Sutherland] is a cop who is loosing his grip on life and at the same time loosing his family because of an unfortunate event in which some one was killed. He is living with his sister played wonderfully by Amy Smart [glad to see her again], and is taking a new job as a security guard at an old department store. Everything seems fine at first but little by little something is stirring and trying to tell Ben something, but what could it be and what could it want? It turns out that there is something in the mirrors and it wants Ben to find some one for him and if he doesn't his family is at stake. So the race is one between man and demon [yes that is what it is, sorry for the spoiler] one out to kill and one out to stop it.

I have to say that I really was not disappointed with this movie after reading a couple other reviews [WP] that let me know ahead of time to lower expectations. Of course since Aja directed this there will be high [as in tension] expectations for the film regardless for any one who follows the horror genre. I have to say that while it is not as good as his past efforts it is still a really well put together film with great direction and deserves a fair shot. Still though his screenplay with Grgory Levasseur based on Sung-ho Kim's film ""Into the Mirror"" is a little weak as far as dialogue goes, the story is there but the right words are not. It seems that the characters are kinda flat and missing something that makes them three dimensional. Still the tense moments do exist within this movie and are really well done and the film is shot perfectly as well. Another thing the film has going for it is the special effects, I have to say that the CGI is masterful and obviously the effects with the mirrors are great.

As far as the acting goes producer/star Kiefer Sutherland returns to a genre that he was once a mainstay in some what. And while he once stole the show in things like ""The Lost Boys"" he is some what restrained in this one maybe that was the character though. Still I feel like something is missing in his performance particularly in the first third of the film. Still when the movie gets going so does Sutherland and that should be giving to his credit; he does do a good job with the film. Amy Smart does a great job as his sister and I have to say that her death scene is amazing, really one of the best things I have seen in a while. Paula Patton plays his wife who wants to help him but is still a little afraid of him does a good job in her role as well, as does Cameron Boyce and Erica Gluck  who play the kids. And of course the person who is really the most important is Mary Beth Peil who plays..........well you will see does a great job and may steal the show as far as performance goes.

I must admit that I thought this movie would give me a little more but it fell a little short, still it is an enjoyable movie that at least should be on your rental list. Some of you will probably enjoy it enough to buy it, I did. I recommend the movie to any one reading this but go in knowing that this is not a classic horror movie but much more so just a good time at the movies.",1232409600,,3787,4.076510067114094

There were a few scenes that were creepy, and one particular gore scene was very unsettling, but other than that I got over the whole fear of the mirrors thing pretty quick.

His remake of Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes was genuinely terrifying, and his script for P2 had potential, even though that film as a whole just didn't work out well.  Mirrors finds Aja helming another remake (this time of the 2003 South Korean film Into the Mirror), and stars Kiefer Sutherland as Ben Carson, an ex-cop trying to get back on his feet, and back into the good graces of his estranged wife (Paula Patton) while he stays with his sister (Amy Smart).  Taking a job as a night watchman of a partially destroyed department store, Ben soon learns of an evil force that is inhabiting the mirrors, and jeopardizing the lives of his family and himself.  Despite some genuinely shocking and gory moments (Amy Smart's scene in the bathtub is, and I just can't help the pun here, jaw-dropping), Mirrors as a whole is just too slow-moving and dull.  Not to mention that the bevy of plot holes, leaps in logic, and Sutherland's somewhat annoying performance don't help matters much here either.  Still though, Mirrors isn't a terrible horror flick my any stretch of the imagination, but it definitely doesn't do a director like Aja justice either.  All in all, Mirrors is worth a look, but here's hoping that Aja rebounds from this otherwise disappointing horror flick.",1231891200,7,1396,4.767634854771784

3658771,3,B001JNNDC4,"Produced by Korean filmmaker Eun Young-Kim and directed by Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension), ""MIRRORS"" isn't exactly an official remake of the South Korean horror film ""Into the Mirror"" (aka. Geoul Sakeuro, 2003, directed by Sung-Ho Kim) but it does have pretty strong similarities (most specially the opening credits) since it is based on the Asian horror film. The ""Americanization"" of Asian Horror films are usually a miss more than a hit--with Aja at the helm as director, Eastern subtlety, slow suggestive, methodical creepiness is replaced by aggressive, grand displays of special effects--such a show-off approach does improve on the original when it comes to pace but doesn't necessarily make it a better film.

Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland, ""24"") is a problematic ex-cop, he has a estranged relationship with his wife, Amy (sexy Paula Patton), has two kids and he is bunking with his baby sister Angela (sexy Amy Smart) until he gets back on his feet. Ben gets a job as a watchman in a burnt out department store called ""Mayflower"". Strangely, the burnt out store has unusually well-preserved mirrors--there is something sinister about them. When your reflection dies in the mirror, then you suffer the same fate. Demons from the past want something from everyone who had ever taken the job as night watchman--now, Ben must get to the bottom of the mystery of ""Esseker"", before it is too late to save himself and his family....

With Alexandre Aja at the helm as director, then the expectations from horror fans will be expectedly a little high. I suppose the best way to approach ""Mirrors"" is by lowering your expectations. Aja cleverly only keeps the opening act, the climax, and the main premise from ""Into the Mirror"". This U.S. unrated version is more visceral and does have more blood and gore than the original. ""Into the Mirror"" does have a relevant social commentary that added some essential ""meat"" to its plot. However, the original also does have quite a number of dull moments and too many missed opportunities, with a subplot that is totally underdeveloped. Aja's approach is kept simple, it approaches a more visceral and violent approach with more effective use of special effects. The computer-generated set designs in the American version is also a lot creepier than the brightly lit, newly re-opened store in the Korean version.

The main premise of ""Mirrors"" and ""Into the Mirror"", you guessed it, are mirrors. There are legends involving mirrors as another walkthrough to an alternate world, and that mirrors can used to capture hidden ""demonic"" entities. This legend was partly touched on in the opening act of ""Constantine"" and this film further expends on this premise. The plot also hits on some medical theories about schizophrenia and demonic possession. The laws of the ""mirrors"" may not be totally defined or fleshed out in this film but it does provide a good idea for a scary experience.

The problems with ""Mirrors"" begin with the script and the dialogue. Considering the assumed limits of Aja's English knowledge, the dialogue is pretty much obligatory and very dry. Also, the part with Ben's estranged relationship with his wife Amy is too perfunctory. I'm not sure, Sutherland managed to express some emotions but the style is too similar to his ""Jack Bauer"" portrayal that makes the ""meant to be"" scary scenes a little funny with a predictable climax after the encounter with the nightmarish ghoul. I really felt as if Aja meant for it to be this way but ended up hampering the film a little. The family tension also overstays its welcome after awhile and  Ben`s trip to the backwoods was too formulaic and too reminiscent of Asian horror films. I rather thought that the powerful social criticism and the subtle doses of satire in the Korean version may have assisted the film's screenplay.

Despite the uninspired script, the film is competently directed. I was impressed as to how Aja managed the shots, I would imagine that it would be a little difficult to shoot a film with a lot of mirrors (thank goodness for CGI) and Aja's set designs were creepy enough. The set ups for the gore scenes were well-directed and the film does have its share of unsettling images. The film's greatest strengths will have to be the opening scene, the one with mangled jaw, the flashbacks with a young Anna Esseker and Ben's first night in the burnt out building; accompanied by an ominous score by Javier Navarrete, the film does have its suspenseful moments.

""Mirrors"" is a more decent attempt at an Asian horror re-imagining despite its many flaws and the weaknesses of the script. I was just disappointed that the mythos of the mirrors themselves and of doppelgangers weren't more efficiently explored and settled to just become one more ""visually inspired"" horror experience. The climax is also very predictable. ""Mirrors"" is perfectly watchable although it is definitely forgettable and wouldn't stand out.

Recommended with caution to horror maniacs, but a RENTAL to experienced viewers. [3 Stars]",1231804800,,5035,5.007168458781362
3658772,4,B001JNNDC4,"Keifer Sutherland has become a force to be reckoned with. Not only does he have one of the hottest shows on television in 24, he's made a series of films that have been hits as well. While his latest may not have broken records at the box office, it does offer some truly terrifying moments, something that is rarely seen in a world that prefers gore over scares in horror films. MIRR0RS may have a bit of well done special effects gore as well, but the story itself and the telling of it offer some truly scary moments.

Sutherland stars as Ben Carson, a police detective down on his luck. Involved in a questionable shooting, he is on leave without pay. Drinking led to a separation with his wife and family. On medication, trying to get back on his feet, he takes a job as a night watchman in the burned out hulk of a building that once housed the biggest and best department store in the city.

It seems that one of Ben's predecessors attempted to burn down the building a few years back, driven mad and killing his family prior to doing so. Now Ben steps into his shoes and those who followed, walking the halls of the blackened building making sure no one breaks in or damages it further.

But something is strange here. Handprints on mirrors that seem to be everywhere in the building and visions of burning victims make Ben begin to question his sanity. Using the instincts honed by years on the force, he begins to investigate deeper into the building. The arrival of a package sent to him by the murdered previous night watchman leads Ben to look into the arsonist who burned down the building.

The trail of clues gives Ben the sources that he needs to get to the bottom of things. But at the same time, the evil that resides in the building, in the mirrors, takes its toll. It murders Ben's sister in one of the most gruesome scenes found in recent years. And then it sets its sights on Ben's family, his ex-wife who thinks he's losing it and his two innocent children.

As Ben races to find a solution to this puzzle, the evil in the mirrors gets closer and closer to his family. A discovery in the water filled basement of the building offers more clues, but time is not on Ben's side. With one way to put an end to the misery, Ben does all he can to save himself and his family.

This movie works on so many levels. The mystery that finds Ben trying to find out what caused all of the happenings at this location is well thought out and believable in a horror film way. His dealing with his alcohol problem and trying to get his life together form an integral part of the story as well. And the family placed in jeopardy not because of his police work but because he lucked into the wrong job holds the viewer in suspense as well.

The cast does a great job here. Sutherland shows torment and anguish well, working to cope with the most amazing scenes that play out before his eyes in the mirrors all around him. Underused is Amy Smart as his sister, offering solace and reaching a gory end. Paula Patton as wife Amy shows the biggest range going from shrill non-understanding wife to caring mother to supportive spouse all in one film.

The effects are marvelous here. Not just the mirrors themselves that curve and poke when the evil is revealed but the gore effects are mind boggling. It's twisted but you can't seem to take your eyes off when Smart's death scene plays out. The sets for the store are magnificent and as much a part of the story as the rest.

MIRRORS may not be for everyone. If you scare easily, tie yourself down while you watch. There are plenty of jump sequences and twists to give you nightmares of your own. The story unfolds well and the pacing makes you never look to see if you're close to the end yet. It's a well made horror film that offers scares. And that takes some doing in today's world.",1231804800,2,3839,4.373071528751753
