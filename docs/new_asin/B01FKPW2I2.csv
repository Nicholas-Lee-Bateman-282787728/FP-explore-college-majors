7750517,4,B01FKPW2I2,"I found this to be a pretty cool story,  as well as great animation.",1473897600,,68,3.857142857142857
7750518,5,B01FKPW2I2,"This is an excellent adaptation of the ""Monkey King"" legend. The animation compares very well to any studio on the planet: Pixar/Disney, Dreamworks/Sony, Ghibli, etc. The blackout between dramatic scenes may have been slightly overused, but that is such a minor criticism I almost regret mentioning it. The voice actors for this film were recognizable. and familiar. I've always been a fan of Jackie Chan. He just gets better and better with age. This film is easily accessible to both Asian and Western audiences. I'm going to start looking for other examples of Chinese produced animation based on this movie. Great story telling.",1473379200,7,632,5.145631067961165
7750519,5,B01FKPW2I2,"Just recently discovered the legend of the Monkey King, and was eager to see this.  While at times the dialog seemed slightly off, this was a solid hit.  Definitely would recommend.",1484352000,,181,4.806451612903226
7750520,2,B01FKPW2I2,"I love the movie in general, but the U.S. version cuts out some small stuff compared to the Chinese release which is disappointing.  I want the original, and not a cut version.  On top of that, the lip sync is off.  You can tell it's dubbed.  I wish they had put more effort into syncing it up for the English version especially when they close in on Sun Wukong's lips in one spot.  The massive difference in lip movement compared to what's being said is incredibly annoying.

We have the technology today to accomplish matching lip movement to words or language so I'm not sure why it wasn't done with this.  Also the stuff that was clipped was trivial.  I've seen worse in kid's movies in America that were *made* in America so it seems pointless to remove things even if they hold little relevance to the story.

I wish I could find a legit Chinese copy of this movie that wasn't bootleg, with good English subtitles.  Would have preferred that over what I got.",1483056000,,964,4.457142857142857
7750521,3,B01FKPW2I2,My son seemed to like it.,1482883200,,25,3.3333333333333335
7750522,1,B01FKPW2I2,"So, I saw this in Chinese and loved it.  The story and characters are great! So, when I saw I could get it on DVD, I was thrilled.  So Jackie Chan did the English dubbing?  Okay, cool.  I put it in and turn it on and am extremely disappointed it the sound and dubbing. Sound effects were somehow lost in the transition: in one scene a panicked villager yells about the attacking ogres while banging on a drum THAT MAKES NO SOUND.  It had sound in the original track; WHERE DID IT GO? Seriously, the weird lack of sound effects is disorienting and disrupts the enjoyment of the scene.  Plus the voice acting is mediocre.  The original made me want to cry in empathy; this one makes me cry with frustration.  I couldn't watch most of it.

Well, at least I can switch language tracks and just watch it with subtitles, right? Wrong!  There isn't any other language track.  How hard would it have been to keep the original language track on the DVD?  I mean, it wasn't like you had to record a new one, just leave a second track of the original Mandarin.  WHY?! I can't watch this, and I'm so very, very sad.",1479686400,10,1103,4.296116504854369

8760964,3,B01FKPW2I2,All dubbed movies look bad. Besides that its a great movie except for one thing. It ends very abruptly. During the credits some questions are answered but still I wish they had continued it for about another 10 minutes to shows us the happily ever after.,1519084800,,254,4.543478260869565
