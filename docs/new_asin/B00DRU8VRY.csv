5851693,5,B00DRU8VRY,"This is so funny, I never laughed so much nor learned so much about the worlds worst cars. Their knowledge about cars is fantastic and how it is presented is great. this is one dvd you will never tire of.",1385424000,,204,4.125
5851694,4,B00DRU8VRY,"This is a short Top Gear special presented by Clarkson and May. It starts as one would expect with examples of truly awful vehicles. But then with a clever twist it explores horrible cars that were produced by great manufacturers that should have known better. A good humored look at vehicles that proves you don't always get what you pay for. A few American cars make their lists of course. Clean language, suitable for the little ones. Good laughs.",1383955200,10,450,4.708860759493671
5851695,3,B00DRU8VRY,"Not bad, but not their best work.",1453852800,,33,3.857142857142857
5851696,5,B00DRU8VRY,"Very funny.  I thought they could have picked a better ""worst"" car though.",1453248000,,74,4.6923076923076925
5851697,5,B00DRU8VRY,"This movie is funny and thorough. I 100% agree with the car that was awarded ""the worst car in the world"". I've been a top gear fan for awhile and this didn't disappoint. Well done.",1446768000,,181,4.2

5851701,5,B00DRU8VRY,Excellent price! Got it for my husband as a stocking stuffer. He's a big fan of the show and really enjoyed the movie.,1423872000,,118,4.173913043478261
5851702,3,B00DRU8VRY,"Normally I love everything UK Top Gear and thought I would give this one a try but I ended up not really caring for this one. I though it just dragged on and their choice for worst car wasn't that great! I am sure there were much worse cars. Also missing was the humor that I normally get from them. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it.",1413072000,3,351,4.0285714285714285

5851704,4,B00DRU8VRY,"Good entertainment for the price, typical Clarkson and May humor, but that's what we expected.",1408665600,,94,5.333333333333333
5851705,4,B00DRU8VRY,"Typical Top Gear in all its glory though Richard Hammond is sorely missed. The ""Special Treatment"" joke was great!",1407456000,,114,5.052631578947368

5851707,5,B00DRU8VRY,It's always a hoot to see what these guys come up with and what they manage to do with it.,1402358400,,90,3.55
5851708,5,B00DRU8VRY,This is one of the best Top Gear specials yet though it only has Clarkson and May but no Hammond.,1398816000,,97,3.9
5851709,4,B00DRU8VRY,"Pretty much every year a couple of the Top Gear presenters get together to do some sort of tie-in to the main show, but outside of a series. Much like the May and Hammond 'At the Movies'. Here we have Jeremy Clarkson and James May and they are out to find an answer to the question of what is the worst car in the history of the world.

Now things start off with a range of truly terrible cars being trotted out and their faults mercilessly exposed and these cars are from fairly.... non mainstream manufacturers may we say. The boys soon ditch this schtick however as they point out that while the terrible cars they started discussing were bad they were at least cheap. So they turn their attention to lemons made by manufacturers that should have known better. All sorts of famous makes are lampooned for the car in their range that just didn't hit the spot. Again the chaps are brutally honest.

At the end they select one car and a special fate is reserved for it. And no that doesn't mean a piano falls on it like Top Gear usually do with Morris Mariners (and no the worst car in the world is not that - it wasn't a spoiler!).

If you like Top Gear and the personalities and the style of the show this is a safe buy.",1398297600,,1222,4.236051502145923
5851710,3,B00DRU8VRY,"Two guys from England compare vehicles two at a time, aspiring to be witty as they do so. Occasionally insightful.  At one point they have a racecar driver put a BMW through its paces on a course, then the two guys try to duplicate what the driver did with a '70's Lincoln and then a '70's Buick.

Occasionally insightful as they whip super cars around a test track (in slow motion). But, when one guy bad-mouths a Ford GT I had heard enough. They are picky about the smallest things.",1392163200,,484,4.366666666666666
5851711,5,B00DRU8VRY,"If you have watched top gear before and enjoyed it you will like this as well, very funny in my opinion as well as mildly informative.",1390348800,3,134,4.1923076923076925
5851712,2,B00DRU8VRY,"Average fare.  Not many laughs. A bit of  a let down, really.  I was frankly expecting more from the Top Gear team.  Talking of team, Hammond was sorely missed.",1390003200,3,160,4.413793103448276
5851713,5,B00DRU8VRY,"Never trust the man in a boat for he CHEATS, or so it is lead to believe.  Go and watch and enjoy.  Most excellent!",1388620800,,115,3.75
5851714,5,B00DRU8VRY,This was exactly what I wanted and it came in great condition. I love watching this show. Thank you very much.,1387238400,,110,4.285714285714286

8596889,5,B00DRU8VRY,What's great about this special is the banter played out between Jeremy and James when they are onscreen together.  This is my go to top gear special to pass an hour of time.  The variety of cars discussed is vast and hearing complaints about the automotive industry in this format is good fun!,1493424000,,294,4.528301886792453

8596893,3,B00DRU8VRY,"I love (original) Top Gear UK, honestly this was essentially just a mediocre episode. I've watched every episode multiple times (November 18th can't come fast enough), so it was nice getting something new, but this just wasn't all that funny. Spend your money on Perfect Road Trip 1 and 2. Much better.",1474934400,2,302,4.826923076923077
