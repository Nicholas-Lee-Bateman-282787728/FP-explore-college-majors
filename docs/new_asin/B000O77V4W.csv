2791886,4,B000O77V4W,"Whenever one of these young superstars comes shooting to the skies almost from one day to the next, one must inevitably ask oneself whether it's just all hype, or they are actually worth the fuzz. I have myself had a casual acquiantance with Justin Timberlake's music for the last couple of years - after all, anybody who does watch MTV just once every year will have stumbled into hits like Rock Your Body, Cry Me A River, Sexyback or What Goes Around (Comes Around) - and so, when Justin stopped by Copenhagen this year, to play for a whooping 54.000 people, I decided to give it a try, just to see what it was all about. And I must admit that back then, I was quite blown away. Not that everything was perfect on that occasion, but he just delivered a show that left no doubt that this was a power to reckon with, in showbiz and in music.

Therefore, when this DVD was announced, I decided to give it ago - to relive what was a great night of fun and music, and to see whether it could stand the test of return to subject. And I must say that overall, this does stand very well the test of time, at least so far. Again, it's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good, and more important, it's a very honest release.

The DVD opens with an interview section with Justin and band, which seagues into opening sequence and title track FutureSex/LoveSounds off latest CD - which also happened to be one of the strongest moments on the CD, and I must say that here perhaps the show falls slightly flat. I will emphasize and give credit to the fact that the songs are not just reproductions of the album tracks, they are fully interpreted in terms of being played live, and this quite stripped down version of the track perhaps falls somewhat short on the vocal part. I would like more presence of Timberlake in the song - large parts are delivered only by the multi-member back-up team, which is a bit of a shame. The same is true for second cut Like I Love You, and although both performances have all the groove one would expect of cuts as solid as these, the DVD does not come off on the best footing in my oppinion.

From third cut, My Love, Justin starts to step more into character, but I'll say his voice really starts to shine from Seorita and Sexy Ladies and onwards. It is evident that Timberlake doesn't have the strongest voice in the bussiness - one could argue that his voice is capable, but nothing more than that - but I will say that he does get the best of what he has got, which is sometimes as important as being talented when it comes down to showmanship. The vocal arrangement leans heavily on the backing section, but Timberlake does more than just lip-synch, and I appreciate the fact that whenever he sings, he sings genuinely live, and once he's started does that better than what I would have expected - and he certainly proves that his smooth falsetto is not just a studio-infused feature. Also one should add that he does a lot of movement on stage - dancing, and running (more about this later!), which naturally takes focus away from the vocal - not necessarily a good trade-off in my oppinion, but I guess that's part of the show, take it or leave it.

The tempo is decreased with the unset of ballad Until The End Of The World from the resent album - not my favorite cut of the record, but Justin does a blistering performance here, which is probably why this track has also been released as live video to promote the DVD release on music TV stations. Next up, however, is major smash hit What Goes Around (Comes Around), which clocks in at a whooping 10 minutes and is one of the absolute highlights of the concert. This is one of the great examples of how they rework the songs in the live setting: The song opens with a beautiful piano intro (the man himself at work here), and I must emphasize here the great sound on this release, which retains the full dynamic range of the music as it was played: The piano section opens quietly, and then halfway through drums, keyboard and guitar sets in to form a roaring crescendo. Amazing, and the song has not even kicked in yet. The song proper is pretty faithful to the album version, which is not a bad thing at all, but also adds a much rougher edge with more dominant guitars, and I must admit that this particular track really wow's me. The final cut before the intermission is the funky Chop Me Up, where Justin is joined on stage by name-sake Timbaland, producer, songwriter et al.

Blissfully cut out from this feature is the overly long and self-indulgant Timbaland-tribute-DJ-section featured in the interlude. This was both overly long and bordering on embarrasing, so I whole-heartedly support its omision. Instead we get a short interview with the two Timbers, before going into the opener of second set, Rock Your Body. I should mention here ther generally very well-structured set, which is a deffinite pro of this concert: Ballance is very well retained between old hits, new hits, and new unknown tracks, and the music flows very well, sometimes uninterrupted, from one track to the next.

The major weakness of this tour, however, is also displayed in this next part: With only two albums in his catalogue, Timberlake has only a limited number of songs to pick between, the next handful of tracks therefore moves far into what I consider banalities: The acoustic medley featuring a couple of N-Sync songs (Gone, Take It From Here, Last Night) is downright boring, whereas the dull Damn Girl from the new album is presented in an overly long version, complete with semi-naked girls which does nothing for Timberlakes musical credibility.

Things turn better, however, with the groovy ballad Summer Love and the almost gospel-like Losing My Way - one of my odd favorites from the recent album, here delivered as a sing-along over playback choir which I think is a wise choice, as the gospel singers form an important back-droping to Justin's fragile voice here. Speaking of back-droppings, I should also mention the ingenious scene-design here: Scene is placed in-the-round, i.e. audience is all around the stage. To solve this problem, semi-transparent fabrics are lowered at different parts around the stage, and works at the same time as giant screens for those who cannot see the man (because of distance, or simply because he's on the other side of stage!) and at the same time as emphasize of the light show. In this particular track, Justin is surrounded on all sides by images of the gospel singers, thus hiding him almost completely from the audience, and vice-versa, making a nice reference to the song catch line ""Is anybody out there?"". I should also say that Justin does an admirable job in moving around the stage, getting out to all parts of the audience, something which is not a small feat in a venue of this size with a 4-sided stage.

The final part of the set consist of a safe pick of major hits, and nothing to complain about here: Firstly, a surprisingly gritty delivery of Cry Me A River (no mention of Britney here!), this seagues into the funky Lovestoned / I Think That She Knows, which again seagues into a surprisingly gritty, at times almost sonically dirty version of Sexyback. Again I must compliment the man for his courage to rework his own songs, even if they are still true to the album versions, the live versions deffinitely has a character of their own, making this release worth having not only for the visiuals. Indeed, I'm somewhat surprised the package does not come with a CD with selected cuts, like similar releases from other artist (I will take the liberty to recommend Kylie's Fever Tour CD/DVD release and Madonna's Confessions Tour CD/DVD releases, both excellent releases).

A bit surprising for me, when I saw the show in Copenhagen, was the choice for encore, (Another Song) All Over Again. This song never did much for me on the album, but the intimate setting here, with Justin sitting alone at the piano, was amazingly strong, forming a nice contrast to the loud inferno of Sexyback. And the boy sings his heart out here! Since the concert here, this songs stands especially strong for me, and I must say it's a surprise highlight of the DVD, and brings the concert to a worthy conclusion.

OVERALL RATING 8/10

Final Comments:

Considering that the man only has two CDs in his bag, this offers both a very satisfactory overview of his career and a surprisingly robust selection of tracks - even though some of them could have been left out, had one had more material to pick from (Sexy Ladies, Damn Girl, and the acoustic medley comes to mind).

Technically, this is a pleasing release. Sound is perfect, and picture is great - and the editing is not too jumpy, as is often the case in concert movies. I could have gone without the cut-ins of interview snippets or comments a couple of places, but overall nothing really compromising.

On the bottom line, I must say that with this, Justin seems to emphasize that he is indeed a name to be taken seriously in the music bussiness. He might not be the worlds best singer, but as an entertainer, he's on the top.",1195948800,36,9107,4.596307692307692

2792000,4,B000O77V4W,"This evening's entertainment was a concert DVD, not a movie. Nice break. It was the ""Futuresex / Loveshow - Live From Madison Square Garden DVD. The concert was amazing. MSG is a huge venue and the elaborate stage was centrally located. Man, I can't even estimate the size of the audience but there were an ocean of people out there. The concert was very well done, but I have mixed feelings about it..

First of all, the filming was excellent. Superb! It gave a real nice feeling for the concert, the performers and the audience. Well done!

I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, and don't take that as a negative statement as I've never seen or heard him before. I've heard of him, but this was my first experience with his music and stage presence. He's talented, without question. He sings and dances and plays the piano, portable keyboards and guitar. Plus he's a good showman and interacts well with the audience. In short, the man puts on a good show and is somewhat reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Did I enjoy his performance? Yes. Also, the supporting cast of the band, singers and dancers were excellent. No expense was spared.

I have a problem with the sound on this DVD. It's awful! Okay, I'm a bit of an audiophile and I like clear, clean, pristine sound. I've got a reasonably good stereo and I can get excellent sound off of most LPs or CDs. No problem. The sound on this DVD is so muddled that I can't understand the lyrics or the voices when the music isn't playing. I've had this same problem with other live recorded concerts and I've had the same problem in going to some concerts. It's the room acoustics. If I had to listen to this concert without the video on a CD, I couldn't do it. No way. I just couldn't stand it. With the accompanying video, which is quite good, I can do it but it induces aural fatigue. That's too bad. It's an excellent concert DVD flawed by the sound.

However, for those of you who are lukewarm fans or if you're someone who appreciates a good live show, you have to give this a spin.

Justin Timberlake is a master performer.  It is his passion and you see it in every frame of this show.  From the stage setup to lighting, choreography to song selection, this concert has everything a music lover is looking for.

He's also insanely entertaining to watch.  His interactions with the crowd, crew and dancers draw you in as if you are right there on the front row.  He flows seamlessly from one song to the next, showcasing his flirtatious charisma as well as his musical genius.

Case in point, both my husband AND my brother not only admitted that they loved this show, but have watched it multiple times.  And they are total jam band freaks.

The only negative is the cutaway shots of girls who barely know the words but somehow got primo seats.  Those of us who have spent a small fortune supporting his career (who also have zero ""ins"" for getting front-row or VIP access) will always envy those who get to experience a performance of this caliber live.

2792007,4,B000O77V4W,"I wasn't that big of a JT fan until I'd seen this show. He has to be one of the most talented entertainers in the world. Everything in this show was nothing short of perfect--the dancers were tight, the vocals were incredible (especially considering his dancing at the same time), the entire band was top-notch, the general theme of the show was original, and the crowd loved it. It's on the top shelf of my collection, and remains one of my most-watched DVDs I own.

THEN, I finally put together a 5.1 surround system. I was excited to finally listen to the surround mode instead of the normal stereo mode. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Two words: subwoofer channel. The "" .1"" in 5.1 is GROSSLY insufficient. The first song is ""Futuresex Lovesounds"", and has that cool synth riff to start it off. I expected the room to be vibrating.  To my surprise, it didn't sound right at all.  I thought something got messed up--maybe my receiver was set in the wrong mode, or the subwoofer got turned off, or a cable got disconnected or something. I must have restarted the song 4 or 5 times changing settings trying to figure out what was going on, and eventually let it play through. EVENTUALLY, I FINALLY heard a wimpy little kick-drum come through the sub, alone. That's it. My sub ROCKS my house for other DVDs (Transformers was incredible), but is barely used for this show.

I DO love sub, but understand when the experts tone it down a little so that it doesn't distract from the rest of the show...but this is not rock 'n roll, it's not country--IT'S POP. It's SUPPOSED to have synthetic sounds and is SUPPOSED to sound ""fake"" sometimes. Sometimes I wish that some of the ""experts"" would retire with their Yanni and let someone else do their job.

More recently, I purchased the Blu-ray edition of this show, hoping it would have a resolution--no luck. I will continue to play it in stereo-mode and let my receiver split up the frequencies. To me, it sounds a lot better.",1290816000,3,1963,4.581196581196581
2792008,4,B000O77V4W,"If you like pop music, and particularly Justin Timberlake, you'll likely enjoy watching this concert DVD.  The NYC venue is high energy, having the stage at the center of the auditorium gives an interesting feel, Timberlake's singing and dancing are decent, his dancers are good, and his band is excellent (especially the drummer, though I found the lead guitarist to be weak, and I play both instruments).

At the same time, it's also evident that Timberlake isn't in the same league as people like Beyonce, Madonna, Prince, Janet Jackson, etc., so I consider this performance to be second tier, and there were certainly moments during this concert when I felt bored and wanted to hit fast forward.

In short, definitely watch this DVD if you're a Timberlake fan, consider it if you like pop music in general, and skip it if you don't like pop music.",1288569600,,851,4.815068493150685

2792016,5,B000O77V4W,"Fans of Justin Timberlake won't be disappointed with this superb performance live from Madison Square Garden in New York. A brief interview with Justin and his band starts the show, transitioning into the title track (Futuresex/Love sound.) Mr Timberlake, dressed in his signature suit, a funky hat and white running shoes looks fantastic and this is a fun, very sexy show in which all of his major hits are covered. Sporting a cheeky grin throughout, JT flirts with the camera, grooving and moving around a huge stage. Taking full advantage of his hot and occasionally half dressed backup dancers, talented singers and musicians. There's no lip syncing here.

My favourite track would have to be the 10 minute long (What goes around...) Opening with Justin on piano, this transforms into a climax of electric guitars, drums and lights. We are also treated to groovy ballads (Summer Love) and the gospel-like (Losing my way.) After an intermission things slow down for 3 different N-Sync medleys (Gone, Take it from here and Last night) before cranking up again on (Cry me a river) and the funky (Lovestoned.) Timbaland, the well known producer, songwriter joins Justin on stage for (Chop me up) and a great version of (Sexyback.)Although remaining true to the originals many of these songs have been re-mixed for the show and I liked these new versions.

Technically speaking this is a great release. The sound is perfect and the picture quality flawless. The stage has been set up in-the-round which gives Mr Timberlake plenty of room to move, showcasing his band and sexy back-up dancers. A bonus 90 minute second disk has been included which features; The making of Futuresex/Loveshow, additional backstage footage, a bonus video track (Lovestoned) and an extended interview with Justin and his crew in which he explains his song choices and their track order.

Songs included; Futuresex/Lovesound, Like I love you, My love, Senorita, Sexy Ladies, Until the end of time, What goes around...comes around, Chop me up, Rock your body, Gone, Take it from here, Last night, Damn girl, Summer love, Losing my way, Cry me a river, Lovestoned, Sexyback and a solo piano performance of All over again.

2792019,3,B000O77V4W,"Justin Timberlake's Futuresex/Loveshow was one of the biggest concert events of 2007. HBO Entertainment filmed the concert at Madison Square Garden for broadcast. This DVD capture that broadcast.

If one thing can be said about Timberlake it is that he is willing to take musical chances. He effectively turns the Garden into an intimate club by performing in the round. He also has both dancers and muscians in sync for the almost two hour performance. Something is constantly in motion on stage. As far as the music performed Timberlake gives his audience healthy amounts of his solo material with some older songs thrown into the mix.

The Blu ray DVD presents flawless picture and sound quality. The 90 minute standard definition bonus disc is perhaps just as interesting as the concert DVD. It features backstage footage, an extended interview with Timberlake and the band, and an interesting 1 on 1 segment in which Timberlake explains his song choices and track order for the entire show.",1245974400,2,995,5.024242424242424

My mistake was watching them first. I was so easily sucked in! Now I have to buy another copy of this dvd, so I can keep this one. It's the 4th one I've bought her (2 concerts & 2 music videos), and my favorite so far. It's the only one that hasn't been censored (I sought this unedited version purposely). There's a full length concert, and not just a few songs, like on ""Live From London"". As mentioned, there's an intro and outro with Justin and crew that gives interesting insight on their tour and relationship.

I'm not very familiar with Madison Square Garden as a venue, but it seems to change every time I see it. I like the effects, especially the netting that is used as a projection screen. I appreciated the fact (as a woman) that the dancers weren't emaciated and looked healthy and sexy. All of the back-up singers and musicians were wonderful, and you could tell that everyone enjoyed touring together and had a good relationship. Of course Justin shows some smooth moves, and Timbaland joins in on some songs. To me everything seemed just right. Not the best concert I've ever seen in my life, but highly enjoyable and worth purchasing and re-watching!

P.S. - I guess it's really a collection of 5 dvds now, including his Dec 2006 Saturday Night Live appearance. Darn good show, and ""Box"" is definitely a catchy tune!",1207872000,,1492,4.522222222222222

2792034,3,B000O77V4W,"Just a short review to say that, although I am sure I will like this video; if you have an el-cheapo (like me) DVD player.....wait for the  April 1 release also shown on search page.  I ordered this import and although the specifications shows it NTSC....it is actually PAL formatted (European) In fact, it has PAL printed on DVD.  My regular DVD player will not play it (it ejects on insert).  My GoVideo DVD-R will play it but video has horizonal lines running thru it and is unwatchable.  So if you order this import, BE SURE your DVD player will play PAL format!!",1205193600,5,567,4.466019417475728
2792035,4,B000O77V4W,"I'm not particularly a fan of Justin Timberlake, but I watched this concert on HBO out of curiosity, and I was very pleasantly surprised. This guy puts on a good show, even if he does owe a royalty check to Michael Jackson, among others. The voice holds up well live, the band was solid, and the choreography was well done; it came together for a very tight, well-produced show. However, that's also part of what I don't like about it: it's so tightly produced and choreographed that there's no sense of spontaneity. Except for the specific references to New York and Madison Square Garden, you get the feeling that it is note-for-note, step-for-step the exact same show that concert-goers saw in Los Angeles, Phoenix and every other stop on the tour. That's about my only qualm with it though... for anyone who enjoys dance/pop music at all, this is worth checking out.",1202774400,,870,4.730263157894737

2792037,4,B000O77V4W,"The show was fun and exciting, but the dvd offers a whole different insight into JT's personality and the group he performs with.  It's great to watch the show all over again (and again, and again) but the interviews and showbiz insights are even more worth the money.",1198022400,4,268,4.583333333333333
2792038,5,B000O77V4W,"Best concert I've never been too. He's always engaging the audiece and he makes the songs fresh so it's not EXACTLY like listening to his cds. I disagree with one of the guys who posted above, Justin has a phenomenal voice, and i think once you watch the video you'll see. Definitely buy the video, he's a musician, singer, and amazing dancer.",1197763200,,343,4.548387096774194
2792039,5,B000O77V4W,first of all i'm very impressed with how fast my dvd was shipped. it was in perfect shape with all original art work. i bought justin's dvd from the justified tour and this one was so much better. tons of songs and a terrific show. watch it on a big screen with surround sound and its almost as good as being in the garden with him. the bonus dvd was a great add. this concert is well worth the money i spent on it. a must have for any true justin timberlake fan. love it!!,1197072000,5,473,3.9894736842105263
2792040,3,B000O77V4W,"Justin can write, sing his butt off and is a looker. However, this performance was mostly good but a mixed bag.

Senorita and Cry Me A River were good save for the crazy electric guitar arrangement. Why that was included I don't know.

Now Justin is s true performer (dancing, singing and playing the piano) who shows talent. However, he's no Britney Spears or J.Lo when it comes to dancing.

The outro, Another Song (All Over Again) is spectacularly done production wise, vocal-wise and especially the lyrical content!

2792041,5,B000O77V4W,"I found this to be an excellent concert all around. From the attention to detail in making the songs sound as close to the originals as possible (without using a lot of taped elements), to the musicianship of JT himself, to his use of audience participation. The only minor complaints I had were during ""Cry Me A River""(should have had a drum/percussion intro) and at one point JT's pants were wet at the kneecaps and I coudn't figure out how they got that way. Odd, yes I know. Other than that, buy it and crank it up!",1196294400,4,519,4.360824742268041
