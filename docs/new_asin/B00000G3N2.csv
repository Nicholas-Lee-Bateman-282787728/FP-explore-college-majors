1215832,5,B00000G3N2,"I've seen many anime tapes/DVDs, but none compare to Sorcerer Hunters. I rented it and watched it so many times, my little sister memorized the theme song. In the first episode, An evil sorcerer is raising a Gamaru (an  evil dragon monster) by feeding him young, beautiful women, (which, of  course, gets Carrot on the job RIGHT AWAY)! In the second episode, another  evil sorceress takes DNA from Marron, Gatou, and Carrot(that surprised me)  to try and make 'the perfect man'. In the third episoide, Carret follows a  pretty sorceress to her castle and are in the bedroom when the rest of the  sorcerer hunters 'drop in' on them. Carrot is surprised when the 'Princess  of Pain' gets him. I strongly reccmond you see this if your an anime/manga  fan.",948585600,4,752,4.730769230769231
1215833,4,B00000G3N2,"I bought this on impulse, but dang if it wasn't cool. You have to give any anime credit that names its characters after European cuisine. The plot is a kind of surreal fantasy world where particularly nasty employers of black  magic must be punished (at the command of ""Big Momma"" -heh) by a  gang of one set of brothers, one set of sisters, and a dumb-fighter type:  the Sorcerer Hunters. The characters are pretty wild, if a bit unoriginal:  Carrot seems to be an older version of Urusei Yatsura's Ataru Moroboshi,  and his sometime love interest Chocolate Misu constantly smothers him,  Lum-style, to the point of calling him ""Darling!"" But the  repartee between the good guys is funny, and both Chocolate and Tira Misu  (voiced by the ubiquitous Megumi Hashabiyara, playing another chick with  taffy-colored locks) do this weird 'transformation' thing where they  disrobe into skimpy outfits and beat up the bad guys - and it's not Sailor  Moon style, which is a plus. The combat against the evil sorcerer is  usually resolved quickly by one team member, instead of through the typical  pitched anime battle. Overall, this series, although a bit derivative in  its character traits, is very original for anime fantasy. If a monster  doesn't need to be fought, they don't fight it, and the series has fine  animation, surprising character development, and more drama than one might  expect. Oh, and that theme song, ""WHAT'S UP GUYS,"" is one of the  catchiest anime theme songs since the original Dirty Pair TV series. ADV  Films found a good one this time.",931046400,,1559,4.8816793893129775
1215834,5,B00000G3N2,This movie is the best anime I have seen in a while. It is on my Christmas list you can be sure of it. The characters are cool in that they all try to outdo one another(except for the one who chases girls all the time). If you  want to find out who does what then watch it yourself and see who's who and  who does what.,928281600,,319,3.746268656716418
7908959,5,B00000G3N2,I for one don't see how someone could give this any less than a four. In fact I liked this anime so much I bought the complete addition. It is fun for the whole family this is one of those anime everyone can watch. The anime dub is perfect picture perfect plot perfect. If you like Project A-ko or Megumai Paridse or slayers you love this.,1069891200,,339,4.151515151515151
7908960,4,B00000G3N2,"The cover, I suppose, was mainly designed to boost sales from college boys and dirty old men.  ::shrug::  But what's inside is a truly funny little peice of anime dessert.  The main character, Carrot, is obsessive about women but endearing, and all the characters except for maybe, Gateau, are surprisingly complex.  Check it out for a few good chuckles.  :-)",1035417600,,359,4.916666666666667
7908961,5,B00000G3N2,"This video is fun. Pure fun. The dialogue knows exactly when to be fun, serious, sweet, or silly, the characters are fun, with their own little quirks (Marrrrrronnnnnn), the plots are interesting, and it's just plain great! From the moment I heard Carrot's opening line, ""I'm not a dirty old man! I'm a dirty young man!"" I knew I would love this series. The title and box illustration are misleading, though. They make it seem like it would be ecchi, but it's not. While there *is* some ecchi humor, it's pure slapstick comedy.

The premise is this: Sorcerers are oppressing the poor magicless people, and they need some butt-kicking. So people tell the benevolent Big Mama (yes, that is her name), who sends Carrot and Marron Glace, Chocolate and Tira Misu, and Gateau Mocha to take care of the job. These great heroes... Wait, what am I saying? These five are anything *but* great heroes. Carrot is weak and oversexed, Chocolate is hopelessly obsessed with Carrot, who'll barely even look at her, Tira is rather nerdy, and Gateau is...Gateau. The only character you could possibly take seriously is Marron, who is *very* protective of his big brother. Nevertheless, the motley crew somehow manages to defeat all the bad guys who come their way.

The art is very nice, even if the animation is only mediocre, and the battle sequences are actually pretty boring. But that's okay.  Marron in himself is enough to please dozens of fangirls. The dubbing is very good, with only occasional lapses from Tira, whose voice just sounds fake. So far, it's purely episodic in nature, but I did notice some dark foreshadowing in the opening theme song, such as images of Carrot getting hit in the back with *some* sharp objects and falling, and Dota crying. Also, before one of the episodes, there's an intro that could blow up into a great big Something.

If you love to laugh, this title is for you.",1019260800,,1890,4.753048780487805
7908962,4,B00000G3N2,"I thouht this was a good anime. I don't think it has a very good plot, but it's still good. It didn't really explain about the people, but you can still understand all the characters and their mission. What caught my was the songs. And Carrot is so funny. He may be nasty, but by the end of the episodes, he mellows out. I totally recommend this tape to the ones who like humor.",1002153600,,378,4.121621621621622
7908963,1,B00000G3N2,"I have seen a lot of anime, and I have put up with the usual disconnected and/or stupid storylines and insipid and/or ridiculous characters, but this one is absolutely the worst.  The characters are named after desserts.  The  basic plotline for all the very short bits (I can't bring myself to call  them stories) on this videotape go as follows: Carrot Glace, who looks like  an undernourished version of Goku from DZ, is horny.  He goes after the  first girl he sees.  He gets in trouble with an Evil Wizard.  The other  four members of the team, which include a dominatrix, a chick who pretends  to be a dominatrix, a gay wizard who waves a card around meaninglessly, and  your typical Big Dumb Strong Guy, fish him out of his trouble.  .... None of these  Evil Wizards are very frightening or even remotely interesting.  None of  the Sorcerer Hunters are interesting in the slightest, they're all carbon  copies of other anime characters you've seen before, minus any observable  personality.  Carrot Glace, who seems to be the main character, is purely  annoying on a level hitherto unknown to man.  He makes Spritle and  Chim-Chim seem like mental giants by comparison.
There is so much other  good anime out there right now you could watch.  There is absolutely NO  reason to insult yourself with this exercise in complete and total idiocy.  This is not only the dumbest anime I've ever seen, this may be the dumbest  thing calling itself ""entertainment"" that I've ever forced myself  to watch.  I kept thinking, ""Surely it must get better.""  It  doesn't.  I beg you to spare yourself this wretched mess.
To add insult  to injury, ADV has tacked on TWENTY MINUTES -- yes, I said TWENTY MINUTES,  I timed it - of coming attraction previews.  That proves they knew how lame  this is.  Why they even bothered to release it is beyond me.
Avoid this  at all costs.  Please.  I wish I had.",967248000,,1891,4.663608562691132
7908964,4,B00000G3N2,"This show is mismarketed.  The box makes the series seem very mature, but really the only mature thing that I saw on this tape was episode three, and  some skimpy ( but not to skimpy) costumes.  The only reason I am giving  this video four stars is because the last episode is way to much.  The only  redeaming thing in the episode was when Carrot gave the girl her flower in  the end of the episode.  The characters are complex which is kind of  shocking with this type of series.  And in the end I was pleased with this  more mature version of Slayers (as one person put it ""less chest jokes  and more chest"").",966816000,,612,4.226086956521739
7908965,5,B00000G3N2,"This was the first anime I actually rented, and I loved it!  The animation  is excellent, and as with most animes, there is a complex and always  expanding plotline.  The whole package is just wonderful, and I can't wait  to see more!",965260800,,234,4.476190476190476
7908966,3,B00000G3N2,"I really really liked the first two episodes on this tape.  They were really funny...I really enjoyed them.  The females transformation thing was  a little bit scary but I enjoyed it...however in the third episode (yes ADV  released a third ep on one tape scary) they had to whip Carrot to change  him back to a human...at this point a video tape that would have gotten 4.5  stars from me fell to 3 stars.  I give the first two episodes a solid 5 but  why did they have to add the whip thing.  Oh and the voice acting for the  sub taped takes 6 stars due to the fact that it has Megumi Hayshibara  (Slayers, Blue Seed, Cultural Cat Girl, a billion others) in it.",965088000,,662,4.216
7908967,4,B00000G3N2,"If you're are not familiar with Sorcerer Hunters (or Bakuretsu Hunter, as it's originally titled) let me familiarize you (the actual review is below). Sorcerer Hunters is a fantasy anime set in the land of the Spooner  Continent. Sorcerers have sprung up, and are using the Forbidden Magic to  harass the people. So a woman named Big Mama has organized a group of five  warriors to hunt these sorcerers down - hence the name Sorcerer Hunters.  The show is a fine blend of slapstick humor (often sexual in nature... but  not too bad), an underlying plot (although you'll have to wait for that)  and action (but it's not action-packed, if that's what you crave). This  formula has proved successful in other anime, such as Slayers and Ruin  Explorers, and works well here, too.
I personally love Bakuretsu  Hunters. It's a wonderful little farce of an anime, with great characters,  art, music and (later on) even a plot. However, the first few episodes on  this volume are not quite up to par with those later on in the series. The  three shows on this tape are connected only in the fact that they are from  the same series. There is no ongoing plot, simply three light hearted,  individual stories. I think the creators were just trying to familiarize  the audience with the characters and set the tone for the rest of the  series. So if your looking for a heavy plot, this is not the tape for you.  Starting with volumes three and four, the story starts developing, but as  for now, it's purely humor. So if that's okay with you, then buy this tape.",963705600,,1551,4.598540145985401
7908968,4,B00000G3N2,"Sorcerer Hunters is a funny show with really good art (duh, the character designs are by Keiji Gotoh) and funny characters.  The show is interesting but it doesnt really go deep into plot, and the episodes aren't really  related to each other in any aspect except for the main characters fighting  sorcerers in every episode. The only weird thing about this dub is the  voice of Gateau, which is in my opinion, kind of goofy; but everything else  is A-OK.",962928000,,455,4.6375
