7957578,5,B000060MW3,"Ever had the pleasure of coming home and finding a gorgeous, naked babe in your bathtub, eager to indulge you in sundry acts of sexual pleasure? Me neither. But surprises like this are not uncommon for Jack (Sebastien Guy), a freewheeling type that has an endless stream of women vying for his attention and a shot at landing a job at his prestigous modeling agency. Not a bad setup. But the business-and his enviable lifestyle-are in trouble when his father threatens to pull the financial rug out from under him. Predictably, all is well by movie's end, but not before taking the obligatory diversions that set up the numerous sex scenes.

The storyline may be predictable and formulaic, even a tad on the cornball side, but Model Solution nevertheless earns an above-average rating for a Playboy Eros flick. What it lacks in substance is ""fleshed out"" by a bevy of beauties that includes a great mix of familiar faces, fresh babes, a cross-over from the XXX side of the industry, and a foxy former Playboy Playmate. It's a great cast.

None will go away with awards for acting talent, but we're willing to tolerate stilted dialogue because they're all so likable, especially Holly Hollywood (as Emma) in her role as Jack's assistant. What's funny is that she's supposed to be the plain, bespeckled secretary-type, but who are they kidding? Just wait until the solo shower scene, when she takes off the glasses, shakes out her hair, and sets the hand-held shower to a very pleasing pulse mode. A legs-spread-wide close-up shot that lingers on the action made me forget, momentarily, that I wasn't watching hardcore; it's that explicit. According to my wife, who screened this movie with me, Holly's resulting orgasm is genuine. Maybe so, but I'll have to watch it several more times before I'm convinced.

Playboy mag readers will enjoy seeing Playmate Katie Lohmann (April, 2001) as she has her way with a shy, unassuming Jason Schnuit (as Steve), Jack's down-to-earth buddy, who graciously accepts her advances and enjoys a pleasantly erotic coupling. Personally, I've never gotten laid by playing the shy guy, but for Schnuit's character, it works like a charm. In one of the closing scenes, we're happy to see the likable introvert finally make a romantic connection with Emma (Holly), who's been pining for Steve's affections. Not to dwell on Ms. Hollywood (who we first took notice of as the sensual masseuse in Staying On Top), but we're going to give her the nod for this movie's Sexiest Starlet. Clearly, she's one actresses who's had real sex before and knows how to portray it on film.

Other noteworthy scenes have Schnuit paired with Diana Espen, who at one point get very creative with a position they must have learned from one of those glossy coffee-table-sized sex manuals. And the obligatory, but welcome, girl-girl encounter is very nice indeed as Kim Yates and buxom newcomer Kitana Baker do it soft and sensual in a hot tub. There's lots of soft caressing and a some nipple-nuzzling, but unfortunately, the ""No Deep Kissing"" rule was in effect (as it is in most EROS productions) and tempered what could have been a smokin' hot scene.

To be sure, we've seen better work from producer/director Edward Holzman (Friend of the Family, Sexual Magic), who's been churning out respectably good softcore for over a decade. That being said, I submit that Model Solution makes no pretensions about being what it is: a sexy romp with an appealing cast, with just enough twist on the sex to make it a good choice when browsing the EROS titles.",1120003200,11,3555,4.869421487603306
