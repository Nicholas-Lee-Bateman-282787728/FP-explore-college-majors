6295771,3,B00ITAQ4LW,"The Power Rangers craze was after my time as a kid and before my kids time so none of us have been exposed much to it. Honestly, I never got what all the hype was about. But the second my kids saw the Power Rangers for the first time, they were hooked! So I knew this new DVD Power Rangers Turbo Volume Two would elicit some excitement in my house. Indeed it did! My kids immediately demanded to watch it.

I always watch DVD's with them the first time to make sure it's appropriate for them at their ages (4 and 6). Some parents are hyper sensitive to violence so this probably isn't for them. It's a lot of action and fighting but in a cool way, not scary. However, if you don't like any fighting or bad guys at all, steer clear of the Power Rangers. I think fighting is fine as my kids understand that it's just pretend and we don't re-enact fighting in our house!

While it's often hard for me to watch, I do appreciate the way the Rangers work together to combat evil and always have each others backs. It teaches my kids the importance of teamwork and friendship and that hard work always pays off in the end. The acting leaves something to be desired for me but I just have to keep reminding myself, it's a kids show.

While I'm not a Power Rangers fan, Power Rangers Turbo Vol 2 was entertaining for my kids and they enjoy all the action!",1401753600,,1346,4.209302325581396
6295772,3,B00ITAQ4LW,I already said in my review of Vol. 1 that this is honestly not the greatest season of Power Rangers (unless you like PR with more comedy to it) but on a positive note with the new rangers the show DOES get much better in this Vol. 2. So this may be worth checking out.,1394668800,2,269,3.909090909090909

8645321,5,B00ITAQ4LW,"""Power Rangers: Turbo, Vol. 2"" picks up where volume 1 left off. With new Rangers from the first half of the season, the series returns to the tone and style of the original ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" episodes. The Rangers balance high school, personal lives, and fighting Divatox and her monsters. Divatox even relocates to a space station so that she can look down upon the Earth.
Like season 3 of ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers,"" the Turbo Rangers lose their original zords and must get new ones. They learn more about the Phantom Ranger and must save the Blue Senturion, who Divatox twice places under her control. The biggest stand-out episodes from this season involve Divatox's evil zords and the two-part ""Chase Into Space,"" which sets up the following season, ""Power Rangers: In Space."" Fans who felt that the series had gone stagnant after three-and-a-half years will find this season a pleasant return to form.",1505174400,,926,4.980645161290322
