8489360,5,B005YYCLHW,"So I grew up with Star Wars, have even played pretty much all the PC games involved in this universe, and my love for the movies stops with the newest trilogy which we all know had its moments but was god awful in story delivery.
I had seen a few Clone Wars shows on TV and realized the animation is actually top notch for this program.
I bought the season package of 1-4 and so far have been impressed with not only the animation but also the delivery of story as well. I have been told by many fans that season 1 is the most kiddie season of them all but that it begins to get better and darker as the seasons progress. I can definitely see the potential of the darker episodes and look forward to getting there but so far there are SO MANY EPISODES that I have yet to finish season 1! So is this worth it? Absolutely.",1360713600,3,820,4.099378881987578
8489361,5,B005YYCLHW,"I saw parts of season 5 on the CW Saturdays and had to investigate. Although at 125 USD it's pricy. Still, there are 88 episodes which should keep me in new, commercial free entertainment for months to come; can't wait to get season 5. It is an amination, but really well done with computer graphics. A great addition to a Star Wars fan's collection.",1358985600,,350,4.484375
