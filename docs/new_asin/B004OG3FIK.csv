8437203,2,B004OG3FIK,"This concert was not at all typical. I didn't get the horn section. Some song selections are disappointing. Debbie seemed a little off. I enjoyed the Rolling Stones cover of Start Me Up, but why here (for fun I guess)? This DVD cost much more than others, but cost is not justified. If you only want the best performances, don't get this one. Collectors will just get all available. The 1999 reunion DVD is out of this world great by comparison. There is a complete concert video from 1979 on Youtube that is a great companion to the reunion DVD. Look for ""Blondie - Live in Ashbury Park (Full Video Show 1979)"" on Youtube.",1390262400,,623,4.473684210526316
