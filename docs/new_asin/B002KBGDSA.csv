8371837,3,B002KBGDSA,"Somewhere it's written that this is the 1st episode in the series.  Usually, episode titles relate to the crimes of the killers.  However, this title refers to the 1st-time detective in charge of the case, and really, to the viewers as well.  This episode majorly rotates around whether a person can get rid of a corpse that weighs more than himself alone.  I watch many shows like ""Crime 360"" and it just irks me to no end when suspects say, ""I wasn't the killer.  It was this other guy whose name I don't know whose traits I can't describe.""  This episode also gives me chills because the killer shot the victim in his teeth.  At one point, you see some plumber's crack from the corpse and I don't know if that was an oversight or a subtle attempt to be titillating.  They show the 1st-time homicide detective interviewing a suspect alone.  I don't know why he couldn't have had a partner in the room.  Another shocking thing is that a trained sniffing dog originally ran to an innocent person's house.  One would assume that those dogs would be correct always, but here is actual proof that they are fallible.  If this were my 1st time watching the show, it would make me want to see further episodes.",1387065600,,1204,4.497695852534562
