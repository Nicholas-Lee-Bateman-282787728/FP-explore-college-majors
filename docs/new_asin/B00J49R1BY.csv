6332700,5,B00J49R1BY,"I love Westerns. And I'm tired of the films offered being more and more amoral. A story with a smokey, constantly moving standard of how the characters measure their own lives is silly and boring. Redemption of Henry Myers is neither of these.
The good guy did not always win and the bad guy did not always loose. Two terrific reversals here in this film plus a lot of excellent camera work and creative story telling.
The actors pulled me in to the story and I actually was anxious to see the next turn of events or outcome from scene to scene.
Great job!
FOLLOW UP TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have now watched The Redemption of Henry Myers several times. I like it more now than before. I think Clayton Miller has a genre he can come back to and be welcomed by true fans of Westerns. I failed to mention in the first review that the two kids in this movie were great additions to the movie. It's not a kid's movie and kids can be treated less seriously by some directors and wreck what might otherwise be a good movie. Miller did a good job with these kids and he had some good talents to work with.",1396310400,61,1098,4.233333333333333
6332701,5,B00J49R1BY,"The actors do a superb job, the storyline is wonderful.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I look forward to it becming available to buy.  Not only do I want one to keep but I plan to buy to give as gifts.  It's too good not to share.  I look forward to more movies from Echolight Studios.  They're doing a terrific job!  I want all my family and friends to see this movie!  Thanks to all who are a part of this coming about!!",1396224000,13,434,3.9651162790697674
6332702,5,B00J49R1BY,"This movie was excellent. It was an inspiring movie with action, drama and humor. The message of the redemption movie shows that there is nothing Christ won't forgive when we come to Him.
Thank you Hallmark Movie Channel!

6332706,5,B00J49R1BY,"Great acting. Great chemistry. Great story line, editing, lighting. This looks like a multi-million dollar project. Filmed on the set of the movie Cowboy's and Aliens, using the house that Christian Bale used in 3:10 to Yuma and the barn used in the ""Astronaut Farmer"" this movie flows smoothly. It is family friendly. The story line is one you will remember for a long time. The kids in the movie are pro's, incredible actors. Erin Bethea, (Fireproof, The Heart of Christmas, Amazing Love, Facing the Giants) and Drew Waters (Friday Night Lights) are the leads in this story of hope, forgiveness and redemption.
This is one of the top 3 faith based movies to come out in the last 10 years.",1395619200,76,690,4.710743801652892
6332707,5,B00J49R1BY,Another great faith based film.  We all need to be able to forgive.  How many could forgive one who killed one of their loved ones.  This shows whether we really believe or not.,1517270400,,177,4.303030303030303

6332709,5,B00J49R1BY,"I loved this movie and its powerful message of the power of God to redeem the sinner and forgive sin when the sinner is remorseful and asks for forgiveness.  Henry Myers has experienced a hard life.  He has made terrible choices which have made the innocent suffer greatly.  Yet, through love, patience and the word of God, Henry find hope in Jesus.  The acting is wonderful, the story solid and the message is unsurpassed.",1515974400,,423,4.675675675675675
6332710,5,B00J49R1BY,"Wow, what an AWESOME family movie - so much better than any of our expectations!! We loved it so much, we brought it to my parent's house on Thanksgiving Day and watched it with family members who would not have chosen this movie on their own but really enjoyed it too. What a great message of forgiveness and God's Grace for all to enjoy. So good with absolutely no swearing or sexual situations making it perfect for even young children to watch (with adult supervision during the mildly violent scenes). We have already watched it 3x and will definitely be watching it again soon - always good each time we watch it. Would love to see a sequel. Drew Waters is such an amazing actor, in fact, the entire cast was outstanding.",1515024000,,727,4.515151515151516
6332711,5,B00J49R1BY,"A wonderful film. The acting,set, and art design is AMAZING!! We would love to visit Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe New Mexico where the movie was filmed. The costume desgner also deserves a five star rating. Erin's tops were pleated perfectly, painstakingly smocked at the shoulders, larger wrist cuffs, etc. The set design full of antiques, like a hand crank washing machine, spinning wheel, log cabin siding, is beautiful eye candy. Topped with amazing actors, and a great storyline. This Movie is a real tresure.
We are pleased to have this in our Amazon Movie Library.",1513468800,,574,4.927835051546392

6332714,5,B00J49R1BY,"I found that the story is appealingly fresh and finally a story with a message, which is what I like in films. There is blood spilt but it is NOT the senseless blood and guts with fake he-men in a tired story line without substance. This is a great film for those who seek a redemption story with Christian values. Suitable for all ages above 7 years. It is exciting, surprising and is well told. At last a tale with a message beyond our world of immediate self-gratification. Character are well developed. Some nice extras too. Five stars for a tale well told.",1503100800,,561,4.456310679611651

The acting, although not perfect, was acceptable and never detracted from the story. I am not a lover of Westerns but this one was well done. It is an unabashedly Christian movie with Christian themes and values. I did not find it overly preachy. It kept returning to its main theme which was, ""a man can change"". By the end of the story the main character has changed but so have the attitudes of several other characters. This is a movie the entire family can watch comfortably and enjoy.",1463011200,,594,4.458715596330276

None of the filth that permeates the trash pumped out by Hollywood today.  A movie the entire family can enjoy together.  One that we are sure to watch again somewhere down the road.  Teaches children, and adults, about faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, forgiveness, redemption, GENUINE true love, and morals (something that most of America can find only in a dictionary).

6332790,4,B00J49R1BY,"A well-acted and produced Christian Western. The theme, ""A man can change,"" was convincingly portrayed in a plot twist that draws the viewer into the emotion and inner conflict in which you find yourself asking, ""Could I forgive in that situation?"" To be redeemed is to be loved, pursued, forgiven ... and yes, to change. The necessary elements of a Western, with gun battles (even with at least one bloody death), a saloon scene, horseback chases, a righteous and justice-seeking straight-shooting lawman, and a beautiful but strong frontier woman, are well-presented. I thought the acting was very good. The children are delightful. I would recommend this film experience to Christians who love Westerns where Good wins in the end. I will balance that praise and recommendation, though, with a few constructive criticisms:  Though the actors were good, they were limited in places by the script. When Henry knelt in the dirt and yelled, ""I hate my life,"" I found myself chuckling in spite of the emotional scene. Those words sounded so trite and over-used, that surely the script-writers could have been more original in this pivotal scene. And though I understand that a movie maker only has 1 1/2 to 2 hours to show a man changing, Henry changed so fast it defied belief. God may change our hearts and our eternal standing in an instance. But our outward personalities and character traits can take a lot longer to transform. For a man with such a rough past who had never before in his life sat down to a meal with a family, he seemed to swiftly take on gracious and wise ways, perfectly groomed, knowing just the right fatherly words to say to the children. This is where a novel or a longer movie could show more of the struggle and process of change. Still, there was struggle and this movie is a beautiful, entertaining, worthy picture of gritty grace.",1442620800,4,1861,4.797507788161994

When Henry Myers is shot by his old partners, he manages to escape their immediate detection and ends up helpless in the house of a widow and her two children. The widow is suspicious and cold at first, as is her son, but young Laura welcomes him with exuberance. Quite a bit of Scripture shared and read; however, it was done in quite a natural way and added to the whole movie powerfully. Erin Bethea as Marilyn, the practical widow, did an exceptional job; Henry Myers, Will, and Laura, were all excellently portrayed as well. The young man Will was so believable as a troubled, angry young fellow (at first), and any character change was done quite well. How will the small family be able to help this man who has been ""dropped on their doorstep""? Will they be able to convince him that, despite his past, whatever evil he has done, that there is redemption in Christ? What will happen when his old partners in crime come looking for him to get something he can't give them? Will the family that has softened his heart be safe from them? Well, buy it and find out!",1433462400,2,1306,4.400826446280992

6332820,5,B00J49R1BY,"One of the better Evangelical Christian, IMHO, films I have seen in combination with a 'Wild West' setting.  Nice cinematography. The clothing was period correct for the most part if you pick up on that kind of thing. The armorer however made a poor choice for his 'snipers' rifle. It was a badly disguised New England Arms or Harrington & Richardson break open single shot rifle currently available down at your local sporting goods store. There are plenty of good copies or even original Sharps, Remington, or Springfield rifles out there that could have been chosen that would have been much better suited to the time period. Same goes for the brass or gold painted modern scope and scope mounts. With that said, it didn't (for me take away much from the picture in general).
The characters were well played. The little girl was really good in her part.
Overall the title says it well, Redemption. Redemption is available in Christ for all who come to Him in repentance and faith.
While not a Robert Ford production it's leaps ahead of some of the attempts by Christian movie makers to do a faith based western.",1431648000,,1114,4.712820512820513

The little girl in the movie was great on her role.  The leading female role was to predictable and way too preachy. I am a Christian and I was even uncomfortable at times with how in your face the dialogue could be. I think these Christian movies could appeal to a much broader audience if the message was more subtle woven throughout the story....people are  not dumb...we can read between the lines and get the bigger picture.

6332972,5,B00J49R1BY,"I have been continually amazed at the quality and caliber of some recent faith-based movies. It is almost as if grace has been especially active in recent years, to help show the world the true splendor and beauty of a life of faith and virtue. It is difficult for us to understand today, since we live in a culture that ridicules God and tries to hide its face from Him. But everything that is good, true, and beautiful in this world, every heroic act of kindness, of forgiveness,and compassion, is all made possible through the God of Christianity. We don't realize it, but we live in a society that has been shaped by Christian ideals. Even the idea that ""all men are created equal"" did not exist in the world prior to Christianity, nor did hospitals, charities, universities, orphanages, adoption, or civil rights, all of which came from Christianity.

This movie is a good reminder of the beauty of Christian charity at work, when Christians actually act as they ought. It shows how the world can be changed for the good when people begin to love and care for one another; it shows how love is not an effeminate emotion, but is heroic and wields great strength to change lives. The acting in this movie was stellar by all involved, and the man that Drew Waters played portrayed all the qualities of Aristotle's ideal man (the man of virtue, who walks with slow but deliberate step, who speaks little but speaks profoundly, etc.), as well as ideal father whose hands are gentle in the home but fierce against foes.",1412380800,2,1518,4.643122676579925

I can't believe that a woman and her children could be lovingly comfortable with a man who accidently shot and killed her Preacher husband in the course of a crime. It's one thing to forgive a terrible crime but another to embrace him and make him a Father figure and  possible Husband. This Man is going to live with the family of the man he killed regardless of weather it was an accident is not believable. It would have been  more believable if Henry Myers died at he end saving her life. The ending needs a major rewrite. And the Grandfather who  was Father of the Preacher is the town Sheriff.

We watched it with the whole family (we've got young ones 6, 5 & 4) they've watched westerns and Star Wars before so violence was nothing worse than what we've already exposed them to. Didn't have to worry about language or immodesty which is something we always have to watch for in regular westerns. Our 4 year old daughter lost interest in the movie, but the 6 & 5 year old boys kept up with it pretty well, they got lost on the plot a few times. It opened up a great conversation with the boys about Jesus and the forgiveness of sins. It touched my heart when my 5 year old told me he already talks to Jesus about his sins and asks Him to help him do what is right. We're always looking for good quality, evangelical movies to show for our outdoor movie events that we use to reach out to our neighbors and this will be a great one that will captivate all the young boys in our neighborhood and will also keep the adults and teens entertained as well, plus a great presentation of the redemptive work of Jesus!",1407715200,,1140,4.306976744186047

6333086,5,B00J49R1BY,"I rarely give five stars to anything - but to this movie I do. It's about belief that a man can change, just as the pastor in the movie died for. When I first saw this on Hallmark Movie Channel, I was caught up in the story. I love surprises, and this movie and story did not disappoint.

It's great to watch Henry Myers change gradually. He wants to, but after his first revelation of what he did, he wasn't sure he could. And the widow and her children were fun to watch. When the widow discovers Henry's secret, of course she is angry beyond belief, as is her son. and yet, in the end - it's about forgiveness.

It's about redemption. I so loved Henry's scene in the desert where he rails against what he had become, and how he wanted to be changed. All that came before at the widow's house was seeding into Henry's decision to change. Because it's a choice to change. We need God's help to do it.

I felt this was a great western with believable characters and a plausible and surprising plot. The twists were great! I love that kind of thing. I'm reviewing an HD copy of Amazon Prime's Instant Video, and the quality on my computer screen was fine.",1405382400,2,1154,4.284403669724771

6333103,4,B00J49R1BY,"The quality of the production and acting is of a high quality you would expect from a Hallmark distribution.  Although only available in SD, the quality of the stream offered is comparable to other SD streams I've viewed on this service. The emotional scenes have an authenticity missing in most modern films with a spiritual tone.  The Western era turn of the century revival culture provides an atmosphere where Biblical concepts could be more openly expressed as opposed to our present culture where political correctness and outright antagonism disdains frank discussion.  The music is richly scored and era appropriate.
The story is predicable within the context of 100 years of Hollywood westerns.  There is no offensive language or sexual overtone which is a VERY WELCOME relief from standard fare.  I would not view the film with very young children who may be sensitive to gun violence there there are several gun flights with bleeding wounds and death.
