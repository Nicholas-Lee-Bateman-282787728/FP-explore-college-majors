2597850,5,B000G1R4UW,"This is my country?
I'm ashamed; I'm concerned; I'm frightened. But at least, now, I am better informed.
This is excellent film-making. It disturbs because in tells the truth (First, in Disc 1, the truth of Little Rock, Arkansas in 1994; second, in Disc 2, the truth 10 years later.)
Hold your breath, America; or cross your fingers, America; or--if this is your preference in faith--pray, America: a long, tragic ride may be beginning.",1265241600,3,436,4.905405405405405
2597851,4,B000G1R4UW,I heard about this from a website and knew I had to see it. It was very powerful and engaging. I have never been able to replicate the feeling of being raised in this type of a society. This dvd was able to capture all the emotion necessary to accurately depict the situation for many of its members. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to view it. Excellent purchase!,1207353600,4,377,4.25
2597852,5,B000G1R4UW,"This is a 2 video set that does a then-and-now look at the gang problem in a perhaps unexpected location.  The videos are excellent for trying to understand the gang mentality from a documentary perspective.

If your Smalltown, USA leadership is denying the existence of gang members 'cause they're just wannabe's, get this video and show it everwhere you can.",1170460800,10,360,4.983333333333333

8128534,3,B000G1R4UW,"This 2 disc set is just ""ok"".  The information is outdated and shows a bit more of the old ""gang banging styles"" if you are wanting to do some research into gangs from 80's and 90's era.  A lot of show but not truly the good information.  Like most gang documentaries it is hard to get truthful and not embellished information from the participants.  A lot of time is taken up with members of gangs showing how ""cool"" they are.  Its an ok documentary at best.",1327190400,,459,4.290697674418604
8128535,5,B000G1R4UW,I used this DVD as research on an essay that compared the warriors of Homer's Iliad to gang culture. Very informative. Very 90's. Get out your slap bracelet and Starter cap before you watch it.,1322179200,,193,4.542857142857143
