1347109,5,B00004S8JT,"I am glad they continued the story of Anne and Gilbert. It took Anne so long to let down her guard down and admit her love for Gilbert. This movie proves her devotion to him as a friend and as a husband. It is wonderful to see how pure and sacred their love for one another is.
From the reviews I have read in the past, some people did not like how it was a complete departure from the first two movies. It was, but that is their real life. These were actual occurances in the world. Anne grew up and became a woman. She still was a bit clumsy and stubborn, but it exemplifies the transcendence from girlhood to womanhood.
This movie still made me cry and laugh, but the whole time watching, I smiled with contentment. There is something about the Anne stories that take me to another world. This movie, by far, did not fail to carry out what we all feel when entering Green Gables.",1000771200,3,882,4.224852071005917
1347110,5,B00004S8JT,"I stand behind Byron 100%!!  I agree that it doesn't follow the books, but neither do the first two movies.  Megan Follows does a surper job as portraing Anne Shirley.  This third movie has romance, suspention (to a degree), and all the other qualifications for a movie.  If you are an Anne fan, you will enjoy this as much as I do and over and over again.",1000252800,,356,4.268656716417911
1347111,5,B00004S8JT,"After almost 10 years, Megan Follows returns to her beloved character Anne Shirley in ANNE OF GREEN GABLES: THE CONTINUING STORY.
Anne Shirley (Megan Follows) returns to Avonlea for the first time since the death of Marilla Cuthbert (Colleen Dewhurst).  World War 1 has just broken out, and all the able-bodied men in Avonlea are enlisted.
Anne stays with Diana Barrie-Wright (Schuyler Grant) and her husband while she waits for Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie), her fiance.  She is heartbroken at the state of Green Gables following it's lease to a string of negligent tenants.
Soon, Gilbert enlists in the war.  Fearful for his life, Anne joins the Red Cross and journeys through Germany and France, frantically looking for him.  Along the way she gets caught up in a smuggling campaign with her former employer Garrison (Cameron Daddo), and begins an adventure fraught with danger, exitement ....and death.
While not following the original storyline of the novels, this charming, emotional return to Avonlea is a must for anyone whose heart has been stolen by the world of Anne Shirley.",999734400,18,1090,5.106741573033708
1347112,1,B00004S8JT,"If you loved the books, you won't be able to make sense out of this movie. There is no connection with the books, except for a vague similarity between the time period of Rilla of Ingleside and the fact that there is a baby involved. One thing that really irked me about this movie is that our beloved Anne from the novels grows into a lovely, and graceful woman, yet here she is portrayed as ridiculously clumsy and rather awkward, as if she were 11 again. Also, the time period makes no sense; they jumped forward twenty years. I agree with previous reviewers; pretend the movies ended at the sequel, then satisfy yourself with the continuing story in the novels.",1518912000,,665,4.55

1347117,1,B00004S8JT,The Continuing Story strains to connect with the preceding episodes. It is just OK until Anne takes off to Europe during WWI where it changes from not-so-good to awful.

1347121,1,B00004S8JT,"There is nothing to recognize in this final segment.  I was spooked out!
(SPOILER ALERT)
  On her own, our Anne goes off to Europe during the war....looking for her husband.
The movie is DARK and everyone is completely out of character.  Anne finds herself living in London, with a baby who belongs to an old acquaintance from New York.  NEW YORK???  Also living in the apartment with them is her ""bosom friend's"" husband whom she rescued from the battlefront.  What???
  Not much Gilbert.  We sure missed him.  Diana's husband was much more prominent...and it was all very confusing.  I found myself fast forwarding  Again and again.....just hoping for a glimpse of Green Gables.  That glimpse leaves the viewer with a broken heart, and a desire to pitch this particular ""continuing story"" in the trash.  Truly awful!",1508457600,5,818,4.911764705882353

1347127,4,B00004S8JT,"An interesting wrap-up of the series. The story plot isn't as pure and simple as the earlier movies, but being a grown-up involves life stories that aren't as simple as when we're kids so I'm not sure that could have been avoided without trivializing the story or characters. This film isn't essential--it doesn't do much to illuminate or amplify what was in the earlier films. But fans of Anne of Green Gables will enjoy another chapter in the saga--revisiting characters and settings they've come to love. The photography is also compelling and the HD format is worth the extra $$.",1501200000,,583,4.84

1347131,3,B00004S8JT,"Between ""Anne Of Green Gables--The Sequel"" and this film, there apparently was a TV series ""The Road To Avonlea"" and between the three efforts, the story got out of sync by 20 years:  In the books, on of Anne's boys goes to WW1 and gets killed.  Here, the entire AofG story, and even more of the aesthetic is tossed by the wayside, and WW1 becomes a plot device to add suspense----will Gil survive?  Is he still alive?

WW1 got even worse treatment in ""Downton Abbey"" so it's nothing new.

Still, if you watch this series, you probably like the sweetness and the limited drama between characters, which always resolves itself.  While hardly as dark or as violent as ""Game of Thrones"" this movie has nonetheless almost nothing of what the others held out for the viewer.  Marilla is already dead at show's opening.  Pretty Green Gables has been sold, and rented out, and quite amazingly, well trashed by the time we get there.  Then it's off to Europe for the end of WW1, where there are various mumbled conspiracies, a traitor that seems to get away with it; an unexplained undercover effort and finally the movie gets back to Avonlea and ends as much mercifully as happily.

Fans who've gotten this far aren't likely to turn away from this dismal effort, but if one missed it one would not be missing much, having seen all the others...",1497916800,4,1337,4.60337552742616

1347133,3,B00004S8JT,"If you took any other characters, any other setting, and didn't try to place this series in the Anne of Green Gables storyline, it would be alright. From an outside viewer it could be fine. I found it palatable but far afield from what came before it in the CBC Anne of Green Gables series. It's depressing, strange, and downright bizarre at times (the nuns!?) but I think the ending sort of makes up for the mess that is the middle. I think it's more true to Gilbert's character than it is to Anne's. I could see how a young doctor at that time would want to go to Europe to join the war, that's believable. I can even see Anne following him. It's not really that their behaviors in the constraints of the weird plot that was constructed in the wake of the producers losing rights to the original storyline that are abnormal, but the storyline itself. Yes, Anne does a very Anne thing but she doesn't act like herself, probably because it's really hard to act like yourself when you're sneaking through battlefields in order to find your missing husband. This adaptation largely takes the light and the joy from the storyline. It was decidedly the writers who mucked this one up, not the actors.",1496620800,,1196,4.516129032258065
1347134,1,B00004S8JT,Watch this only if you want to see a storyline that is the farthest thing from what the author actually wrote about Anne's adult life. There is not a single recognizable thing from the books in this script. This movie is infuriating.,1495411200,3,233,4.571428571428571

Still very romantic, just in a more grown up real life way. And Fred is wonderful, but certainly not the same Fred. And since all of the other characters have stayed strong, it's odd for me to see a change. That being said. I do always watch it with the other 2.

1347190,1,B00004S8JT,"If we had never seen Anne of Green Gables, and the sequel, then maybe we could have liked this movie.  Maybe.  But as a sequel to the first two movies it was awful. Megan Follows forgot how to be Anne Shirley. Jonathan Crombie forgot how to be Gil, Schuyler Grant forgot how to be Diana. The only person who seemed to know their character was Greg Spottiswood as Fred Wright (Diana's Husband), and he wasn't even the original actor.

The movie is set in WW1, and we see a fair amount of gore.  In one scene, Anne puts her hand on the side of an injured woman's face.  When she pulls her hand away, we see blood pooling up as the woman dies.  Another scene shows a doctor from behind as he poorly acts sawing off a man's leg.  This is a far cry from Matthew or Thomas' death scenes in the first two movies.  It has a Saving Private Ryan feel about it, in that they are trying to show the horrors of war, but that's not what we want from the Anne of Green Gables series.

Toss everything you know about Anne of Green Gables aside.  This is a war and suspense movie.  Lots of action and spy type mystery.  There was only one scene where Anne even talked like Anne.  This entire thing was abysmal.",1452988800,5,1193,4.1798245614035086

If you want anything close to the story line of the Anne of Green Gables book series this couldn't be farther off base. I was willing to overlook the somewhat muddled plot lines on Anne of Green Gables,The Sequel. It had enough of the books to satisfy Anne readers. The Continuing Saga was so far off base it was unrecognizable. The only thing that was the same was the actors and the names of the characters.  For those of you familiar with the beloved book series you know that Gilbert and Anne were safely at home worrying about the fate of their grown sons during the Great War. Davy, another orphan Marilla adopted was running Green Gables. It was never left in the hands of renters. Anne and Gilbert's daughter, Rilla, raised a ""war baby"". Anne and Gilbert would have been married for over 15 years if you follow the timeline of the books. Gilbert would have been too old to fight in the war. There were a whole bunch of plot lines in the movies that weren't in the book at all. I don't understand why they couldn't follow the books a little closer. Had they followed the plot a little closer there could have been a lot more movies.",1452643200,3,1270,4.358649789029536

This however, is a dreadful waste and should be avoided by Green Gables fans at all costs, simply because it's such a jarring break from what we've come to expect. None of the characters seem like themselves and the story barely resembles anything written by L.M. Montgomery.  If you're interested in learning of what happened to Anne following the events of Anne of Avonlea, do yourself a favor and read the books instead of inviting this horrible thought out sequel into your DVD player.",1451001600,3,658,4.529411764705882

1347203,3,B00004S8JT,"As always a fine performance by all the actors.  I really loved watching Anne and Gil's relationship grow and mature.  My main complaint is for a girl who never wants to leave Green Gables Anne leaves quite often.  In all three movies she always mentions how much she loves Green Gables, how she could never be happy living anywhere else, how she wishes both Gil and her could grow old together here.  After all that and finnally getting Green Gables back thanks to Gil buying it for her she tells Diana that she can continuing living there while her and Gil go off and buy another house someplace else.  That's just plain stupid since Diana is rich enought to buy a house of her own and not sponge off of Anne.  However that is my only problem with the final chapter in the Anne of Green Gables saga.",1441324800,,801,4.378378378378378

I ordered this DVD and it arrived the next day (I do live in Ft Worth TX, very close to an Amaxon dist. Center). The movie was a nice ending to the series, but not at all what I expected. I enjoyed it, but I'd say it was the weakest of the three films, mostly focusing on the war.",1439510400,3,421,3.741573033707865
1347206,1,B00004S8JT,"This review is about 15 years late but I'm just now watching the movie. After the first two movies, this was a total disappointment! None of the starry-eyed innocence, or  go-get-em attitude, which made Anne's character so popular, is present in this installment. Although she plays a woman in her 20s, it is hard to get pass Anne's deeper voice, aged face, and emotionless personality. I can't reiterate enough that the innocence of the character is missing. Whereas the character in the first two installments is mindful of what is considered ""proper"" between unmarried men and women (during the early 1900s), the blushing Anne we had all come to love, is gone! Rather than a young man, and woman, who are experiencing young love, they remind me more of an old married couple. We are presented with a dull  Anne who is jaded, drinks, is flirtatious, and definitely not innocent. Given the bold passionate kissing and petting between Anne and Gil (before they are married), it is easy to get the impression that these two characters have already been sexually intimate, although it is never addressed in the movie; it is further suspicious when they both move to New York together, while still unmarried. As for the rest of the movie, I won't even attempt to describe the strange relationship between Anne and (1) her best friend's husband (Frank), and (2) yet another man who is in love with her (Jack). Neither will I describe the brutal war scenes with an occasional profane word thrown in. Let's just say, this movie was damn depressing!",1439164800,,1542,4.837121212121212

Megan Follows seems like a totally different person (probably because she had grown up so much since the original series!) and her character doesn't even seem to remind you of our beloved Anne.

1347213,3,B00004S8JT,"If I ignore any idea that this movie is supposed to be based on the books by L. M. Montgomery, then I could give this movie a five star rating. I decided not to ignore it and have given this movie three stars. The reasons I don't like this movie are as listed below.

1. It's like they took the characters created by Montgomery and make up their own story about them.
2. Some of the characters they put in the movie were NOT in the books.
3. Gilbert was NEVER in a prison camp.
4. Anne's children were her own biological children.
5. I don't believe the producers realized that Anne would have been ALOT older at the time of WWI. It's as if they took the books Anne's House of Dreams and Rilla of Ingleside and smashed them together along with their own creation.
6. The actors for Anne and Gilbert were WAAAAAY to old. The both had to have been in their thirtees. Anne and Gilbert would have been in their mid twenties when they goy married.
7. I can't quite figure out the relationship between Anne and Fred. Fred would say things like "" I feel like he's both of ours."" (speaking of the child) WHAAAAAAT!!! I'm sorry but the whole THING with them living in the little apartment, taking care of the baby, Fred holding her hand and saying things like what I just mentioned. (he said the same thing about the baby being both of theirs more than once) It all seemed creepy and inapropriate to me.

I did like the story and thought it was very sweet and touching. I just had to look at it as having nothing to do with L. M. Montgomery's books.
The acting was fantastic and I do intend to watch it again and again. The characters were believable except for the two American actresses, who befriend Anne. I am an American and, although, I know the makers of this movie didn't intend for it to come across this way, I found the silly, brainless characters to be offensif. I am sure American women did NOT behave that way. The movie is worth your time and money, but I warn you if you are a hoping for an accurate movie based on the works of Montgomery's books you won't find it here.",1434499200,,2077,4.269035532994923

1347216,1,B00004S8JT,"I agree with Lawrance Bernabo's review.  When I listened to Kevin Sullivan (the director) in the interviews attached to the first 2 movies, I too felt he did not ""get"" what L. M. Montgomery's stories were all about.  ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" leaves no doubt.  It is as though he took a beautiful rose and stomped it into the mud.  I also felt that he thought too much of what he had to say and too little of what the original author had to say.  It is a marvel to me that so much of the spirit of her story got past him into the 1st two movies.

The story was about a bright girl who was traumatized by the very difficult childhood of an orphan in the late 1800's struggling to find love and meaning.  Many adopted children at this time were essentially indentured servants, not sons and daughters.  Many people were changed for the better by their interactions with her, but Anne was profoundly changed, saved, rescued by Matthew and Marilla and many others in Avonlea and elsewhere who each had a profound influence upon her for good.  Anne starts the story with a high IQ, but a low EQ (emotional intelligence score) because she had precious few positive role models.  In Avonlea she found herself surrounded by people all of whom were flawed, but most of whom were not truly mean.

Matthew's wisdom is undervalued by everyone, including Marilla and himself, but he was the steady rock that anchored the lives of Marilla and Anne.  It is difficult to know his IQ because he received no education and did not say much, but, when he did speak, he clearly had a high EQ, much higher than Marillas.  By the time of his death, Anne had enough of a foundation to carry on.  Anne's story is about a young girl desperately grasping for hope and love who is rescued by an elderly brother and sister who never married and still lived on their deceased parent's farm (with them also being rescued in the process).  She and Gil get off to a very rough start.  Gil has loved her all along, but it took a long time before Anne could surrender her pride and admit that she loved him, too.  They developed a deep and committed love that made for a beautiful and lasting marriage.

That ""happily ever after"" was torn to shreds in this awful, horrendously-written movie.  It is Hollywood garbage and bears no resemblance to Montgomery's story.  The actors are very talented, but the scriptwriters failed them.  Do NOT watch it.  It will soil and taint the 2 movies that preceded it.  Watch ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel"" (also called ""Anne of Avonlea""), but do not EVER watch ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"".  I wish I could erase the memory of watching if from my brain.",1433030400,,2723,4.476673427991886

I liked that Anne and Gil are finally on good terms with each other and there are many innocent romantic scenes to be had. Gilbert is a dashing young doctor and Anne finds many jobs during World War I. Anne of course gets herself in all sorts of troubles while looking for Gilbert in Europe. She nearly gets herself killed a few times but manages to escape harm. Then of course there is a cute baby in the movie which keeps Anne very occupied. So the question is will Gilbert and Anne ever find peace and quiet for themselves. With all that goes on in this movie you will really wish for a happy ending.

At the time WWI broke out, the characters from the original Anne of Green Gables story should have been well past middle age (see Rilla of Ingleside, one of L.M. Montgomery's books in the series). It was entertaining enough, from a movie point of view, but very disappointing if you read the AGG series and were expecting the movie to tell the same story.

1347280,4,B00004S8JT,"It is disappointing that this continuation veered entirely from the book chronicle, which is excellent, but I have to say that it is a worthy enough presentation in production values.  They just couldn't resist the common urge to ""update"" the character to the ""modern ideal,"" according to the media anyway.  However, Anne was and is rock solid in her convictions, somewhat impulsive still, loyal to the death, certainly parts of her character.  But the books know nothing of these events. It is a tribute more to Megan Follows than to LM Montgomery.  The character of Anne is stellar and the Follows portrayal the same. though I agree she shows more wear here than her film contemporaries.  Yet, she delivers the book's wonderful girl and amazing woman.  Gilbert grows up very responsibly as well. I thought the actor's portrayal very nuanced, attractive and finely executed.

However, again, this episode is an entire invention and departure from the author's accounts.  Anne and Gilbert moved to their first house (House of Dreams) upon their marriage in another part of the island where Gilbert obtained his first medical practice.  Then, as they outgrew the house, they move to Ingleside, where most of her children were born and raised.  What is wrong with that?  Nothing at all. Mr. Sullivan, et al elected to position Gilbert in the war, perhaps for the adventurous element. The book facts are that Anne and Gilbert's grown sons went to war, Gilbert being too old by then and about the only established doctor in a large radius.  Anne never lost access to Green Gables, nor did it run down to shack status.  Diana's husband and marital situation are not developed in the books. There are needfully many new characters to go with the entirely new circumstances.

Credit must be given to the truly outstanding portrayals and overall authenticity of character development in this offering.  I was most impressed with the quality of performance from Ms. Follows in this. However, it remains a puzzling deviation from the books, which series is a merited classic.  Thus, four stars for performance and development of character, withholding the fifth due to disappointment over the totally invented circumstances.",1387411200,2,2214,5.0578512396694215

I have grown up with the whole series and I felt this one really made Anne feel she could not live with-out GILBERT for the first time he was not there and may not ever return to her. I also liked the fact that even though Anne choose to not sit by like most of the women back then and wait to hear if her husband was missing in war or even killed Anne had to go find him and help... just like when gill was sick when they were younger...She fought her own war and many challenges to get back her first love ...BUT.SHE also had her own life, it was empowering to me to see such a strong female roll , for Anne never gave up no matter what the circumstances.... Megan is a fabulous actress.  .. ...My favorite scene and the most emotional for me was when they finally spotted each other when she was on stage with the two women she met on her journey, it was very powerful ...I even cried...(its a read-head thing) I felt they both just had to get back to one another and when they did , the characters put such passion into it, it was very emotional for me I guess I'm just another hopeless romantic. I must say..this was the type of movie you think about days after(I guess thats why I am here writing about it)I felt the need to give props to all. I also loved the fact all the real cast was back years later it couldn't of been any other way.  ...However I was just able to see this series the other night on the channel INSP for the first time , I even sat on my couch for 4 hours to watch the whole thing(my ass hurt the next day) but well worth it. I was a little baffled to read a few of the negative post's for I thought it was done fabulously I loved the story , I learned that back then if you were a young man and didn't go fight in a war and put country first you weren't really respected as a man...and that the young men felt  obligated. Although I do want to thank all our soldiers who ever fought a day in a battle for us , you sacrificed so much. With that said...I STRONGLY suggest everyone who can catch this flick..I love it and a BIG thanx to all who had any part in this and all the series... Im glad to have grown up with all the characters...  ..How-ever I do have One question... is this the last series ... I thought there was a sequel but it doest have THe original cast...where Anne is older , GILBERT DIES...and they had kids...is this true...and why would the original cast not join I also heard Gilbert was killed ....

1347296,1,B00004S8JT,"I wish I could give this movie ZERO stars.  I will never watch it again.  I had recently seen the first two movies and was thrilled to find out that there was a third!  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. (I haven't read any of the books, although I'm going to read them all, now)

So, right away I'm wondering what in the world happened to Megan Follows' voice...why is it so deep?  Is she a smoker? Why does she look and sound so much older???? Only 5 years are supposed to have gone by. By the end of the movie, Gilbert is gray at the temples!

Then, the romance and chemistry between Gilbert and Anne is completely gone!  We had to wait for two whole movies before we get to see them share one kiss, and now, we find out, they've waited so long to get married that there is no thrill or chemistry left!

I'm sure at that time and date, these two would NEVER go off to live in New York without being married!

Why in the world has Green Gables disintegrated in 5 years?  Why does there have to be a fire at all?  Why is Diana unhappy, snooty and sending her kids to bed when it's broad daylight?  Why is she filthy rich and yet has to live at Green Gables after the war?

It's RIDICULOUS to think that Anne would share an apartment with another married man (who happens to be her best friend's husband).  She has two questionable, borderline relationships after finally marrying Gilbert!  By the way, don't hold your breath waiting for the wedding, it's completely silly, unromantic and over in a flash. We don't even get to see them finish their wedding dance.

Most of the movie Anne is running around, while the viewer is left wondering what in the world is going on...am I watching a ""war movie"" or what?  The movie is about war-war-war.  And of course Anne is running around carrying this baby who never stops crying (yet most of the time she is hiding and the crying never gives them away).  It's completely ridiculous!

When Anne and Gilbert finally are reunited and they return home, it's a big nothing. All Anne cares about is whether the boy will remember her.  Of course it's totally goofy, but this kid (who is just as cute as a button) remembers her and runs into her open arms, which no child estranged from their caregiver for that long would ever do.  Actually, the kid was so cute it was the only part of the movie I could even think of watching again. (But I didn't.)

How in the world could they do this to Anne and Gilbert?  I'm going to take the other reviewers' advice and read the books.  This movie depressed me for days. Don't buy it!  You will hate it!  Leave your memories in the happy place they were after the first 2 movies. I can't think of a single reason to ever watch it again.",1373760000,7,2726,4.294117647058823

1347321,1,B00004S8JT,"I first saw ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea""/""Anne of Green Gables- the Sequel"" as a child in the '80s.  I immediately fell in love with the romantic but realistic, warm characters I saw in the films, characters who made me feel at home with them in a special and magical place.  Anne was so sweet and smart and fiery- her spirit could never be diminished- I felt an immediate kinship with her.  Gilbert was so strong and smart, so romantic and loyal; his heart never changed.  Matthew was the sweetest man I'd ever seen, hidden behind that shy and somewhat gruff exterior.  Diana was the perfect best friend, and Marilla, though tough and strict, still had a touchable heart that was able to learn from and embrace Anne.  I was definitely a touch disappointed in ""Anne of Avonlea"" that we didn't get to see enough interplay between Anne and Gilbert, but I got over that.  Afterall, the storyline was still enjoyable and it still ended on a good note (though I sincerely wish that note had been extended to be a full magnificent song).
  I was so incredibly excited when I learned there was going to be a continuation of their story!!  Oh my goodness! I couldn't believe it! They were going to show me the interplay that had been missing in the Sequel! I was going to see all my beloved kindred spirits from when I was a child!  I couldn't wait!  I made my whole family sit in the room (even my father, who of course had very little interest but was supporting his excited daughter).  I made refreshments for everyone and did a countdown to the day.
  I don't know if I have ever been more disappointed in a movie.  The relationships didn't have their warmth.  I still didn't get to see the interplay that should have been there between Gilbert and Anne.  The wedding that should have been the pinnacle led up to by the first 2 movies was glossed over, almost an afterthought.  The storyline was ridiculous.  My beloved kindred spirits were painfully absent- their personalities taken over by some Sullivan monstrous creations.  Yes, they still shared the same names.  Yes, on paper some of the relationships were still the same.  Yes, I even admit that there were a couple of moments when hope began to bloom that maybe, just maybe, a few seconds of the old warmth was resurfacing, but it never actually happened.  This was NOT a true ANNE OF GREEN GABLES movie!!!
  That said, it's been years since that travesty of a first viewing occurred.  Nowadays I've learned to not hate the movie, and sometimes I even want to watch it.  But I've had to make a point of reminding myself that this movie is NOT about our ""Anne girl"".  I am forced to play a mindgame and tell myself that this is just a dream/nightmare that our ""Anne girl"" had one night and not the reality that she actually lived.  And by disallowing this from being the true fate of the girl who was my bosom friend in the 80s, I can actually find some enjoyment in what would otherwise only be a true cinematic tragedy.
  If you haven't seen this movie yet, my advice is that you're probably better off not seeing it.  If you have seen it and are having difficulty getting it out of your head when you're attempting to watch and enjoy the first 2 movies, my advice is to try the same mindgame I've been forced into ""This is not real.  These are not really Anne, Gilbert, Diana... They are figments from a nightmare Anne had one night and they will go away in a few hours and then she will be back to the real her and the real Gilbert and the real Diana and the real Avonlea...""",1344556800,7,3549,4.442724458204334

1347323,3,B00004S8JT,"Well, to be honest, I liked the story more when she was younger. But also because substantial portions of this film were taken up with World War One, and I don't remember anything about Anne going to war in the books. She grows up, goes to New York with Gilbert while he's in residence at Bellevue (I was a patient there once, but it had changed significantly in the meantime), works for a publishing company, and eventually has a book published. When she and Gilbert have both had quite enough of New York (and, by implication, of Yankees), they return to PEI to discover that the people who bought Green Gables had rented it out to some trashy people who very nearly destroyed it, which broke Anne's heart. Marilla's death is only mentioned in passing.

Then Diana's husband Fred volunteers for the Army, and when Gilbert goes to volunteer at a local veteran's hospital, he finds that the soldiers who are being returned home had not been treated properly in the field hospitals, or even on board the ships coming home, and he volunteers, too.

Anne's letters to Gilbert come back to her as unforwardable, and so she decides to go to France and see if she can find out what has happened to him. There are many adventures in between, but she does eventually find him. Almost none of this movie corresponds to anything in the books, but that does not make it a bad movie. It's pretty good, although I seem to recall I gave the first one five stars, the second four, and this one three.

The content of the film is quite dreary and depressing . . . . and not to mention lacking in ORIGINALITY.  If anyone has ever seen the 1977 film ""Julia"" with Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Robards, and Maximillian Schell, they would see quite a few similarities in the storyline.  Almost every scene dealing with the underground war effort in Europe is almost identical to those in ""Julia.""  Anne's relationship with Garrison is almost a mirror image of what was portrayed between Lilian Hellman and Julia.  Anne's perky and vibrant personality seems to be lost in this film, even without the distressing war scenes.

1347326,2,B00004S8JT,"In one of the early scenes in this movie, the main character, Anne Shirley spots her  beloved Gilbert from the beach and runs to greet him...only to do an epic faceplant in the sand.  This pretty much sums up this movie.  It strives and yet falls flat on its face repeatedly. It was an ill-conceived attempt to further cash in on the Anne franchise.  Unlike the first two parts of this ""trilogy"" of movies, this story is original and not truly based on the works of Montgomery at all.  Even overlooking that, the story is weak at best and reminiscent of an early soap opera or the worst of Danielle Steele.  Characterization is lacking.  Gone is the polyannish girl with red hair who would illuminate people's hearts with her flair for the dramatic and her love of words.  We are given in her stead a generic female protagonist who lives in fear and whose only real drive is to reunite with her husband--she could just as easily be a grown Nancy Drew.  The writing was stilted at the best of times, so it is a credit to the extraordinary acting abilities of Megan Fellows et al. that they were able to deliver some of these lines without choking on the cheese.  The Magic of Green Gables (and Avonlea in general) was that it was an archetypal Home.  It was a place where the pies were always hot and hearts were always glad.  This movie begins with a violation of that, so it begins on a note of betrayal. It continues in that spirit with the addition of adult subplots that have no real business in a young adult movie (marital difficulties, ethical dilemmas, hospital politics...)  I have given this movie a rating of two stars because as usual the acting was superb and it was just barely enough to pull this movie from the edge of the cliff.",1325548800,5,1745,4.449685534591195

1347342,1,B00004S8JT,"Like most other reviewers of this film I thought it was a horrible betrayal of both the books by LMM and their spirit. Like others when I first heard of this third film I had visions of the continuing story of Anne as told in the books by LMM. Imagine my disappointment to find that it was Anne in name only! I found myself wondering why the producers chose to tell a whole new story rather than continue to adapt the books. The only conclusion I could reach is that they could not bear portraying Anne as a contented wife and living the traditional life of a mother at the turn of the 20th century. It's true as the books continue Anne herself recedes into the background of the stories, becomes well, an adult, leaving most of her impish ways behind. But LMM then concentrates on the creation of a whole new set of youthful characters, Anne's children, who also have wonderful childhoods, romances, and grow up to fight in WWI with results that will leave a lump in any reader's throat. But I'm afraid that to modern sensibilities, after decades of radical feminism, Anne's character as it was developed by LMM was far too much of a ""happy homemaker"" for them to take. In short, they had no interest in an adult Anne living as an ordinary married woman at the turn of the twentieth century. Thus, this film where Anne lives as an independently employed professional woman, runs off to NY with Gilbert, the rushed wedding, and dodging shells on the warfront. Truly a dissappointing film all around. But there is still room for proper adaptations of the remaining Anne novels, even if they are made with different actors, and I'll welcome those if they're ever made.",1295222400,7,1666,4.575250836120401

1347344,2,B00004S8JT,"I knew that the reviews were bad here, but my daughter loved the first two films in this series and wanted the complete set for her collection.  Reluctantly, I got it for her, and my expectations - of the worst of the 3, a terrible film that almost ruins the whole concept -  were not disappointed.  Indeed, this film is so poorly scripted that I was shocked.  The actors are good, but even they could not save this.

The plot is ridiculously convoluted and impossible to believe after a time.  Anne goes to NYC with Gilbert, but both of them experience terrible career setbacks.  Upon return to Avonlea, they set about restoring Green Gables during the patriotic fervor for WWI, as seemingly all of their friends are departing.  Gilbert decides he must go too, only to vanish.  Anne decides to go and find out what happened to him, setting off a series of adventures that leads to a ring of spies, innumerable ridiculously unbelievable coincidences, all amidst war where the bombs are falling nearby, other people fall for Anne, etc etc.  Not only does it not hold together, but there is virtually no development of interesting characters, not even the writer who betrays her.  Some promising characters make appearances, but no depth or flesh is added to the bones of their behavior.

Beyond the plot, the spirit of the series is lost here.  There was something so urgent, so pressing about Anne's hopes and efforts, the blooming of her talents for friendship, love, and work - all the great signs of a healthy psychology - that are simply lacking in this film.  Even my daughter was laughing at it by the end, I am sorry to say.  She is glad to own it as it completes a collection, but I doubt we will want to watch this again.

There is some advancement of the plot lines.  Anne's bosom companion is not in a very happy marriage.  They do get married and decide to move on.  Anne still writes and works.  Gilbert is also brilliant and with singular integrity.  Finally, WWI is portrayed fairly well.  But that is it and it is all so predictable.  There is also very little humor or discovery in this

Oh and the wedding! Or lack there of I should say. Nothing from the books. Nothing. In this dumb movie they had a quickie wedding so Gil could go off to war.

1347349,3,B00004S8JT,"""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" is the third ""Anne"" television installment by Sullivan Entertainment, following the excellent ""Anne of Green Gables"" and very decent ""Anne of Avonlea.""

She and fiance Gilbert move to New York City, she to try her hand at writing, he to finish his medical residency.  The trip is a disaster, and their attempt to pick up the pieces back at Green Gables is overrun by the coming of war.

It is a delight to see Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie reprise their roles as Anne and Gilbert in a story that traces a pathway to their long-delayed wedding.  Less delightful is the decision by the producers to embed Anne, Gilbert, and a number of familiar Green Gables characters in a completely new, tangled, often implausible and sometimes disturbing storyline about the First World War.

1347352,4,B00004S8JT,"I very rarely review any DVDs I watch, but I felt that I had to write one for Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story, since I almost -- almost -- didn't watch it, due to the reviews I read here at Amazon.  Personally, I'm happy that I disregarded the majority of the reviews and decided for myself to take the chance.  For me, it was worth it.  Yes, this installment doesn't follow the books.  But then, I never really felt that the later books ever reached the high plateau set by the earlier books either. And yes, there were some facets of the miniseries (most glaringly, Ann's unexpectedly vocal antiwar stance and the uncharacteristic whiskey consumption, which at least had the benefit of eventually being related, if not absolutely necessary, to the plotline) that diverged significantly from the direction which Ms. Montgomery had taken Anne's character. And yes, there was certainly a good bit of playing fast-and-loose with the author's timeline.

On the other hand, if there was going to be a sequel, the time and cost demands of making such a production more or less required that the story could not follow the series of books. Just the basic setting up of the sequel as defined by the author would almost insist on a miniseries of its own, and let's be real: once Anne and Gilbert get married in the books, it's pretty well their children's story, and while I certainly can't speak for the other 300 reviewers for this miniseries, I myself can say that the reason I would -- and did -- watch any sequel to the first two installments was to see Anne and Gilbert finally get together.  At least in this series, we did in fact see Anne and Gilbert together at last, finally the kindred spirits they were always meant to be.  In fact, one of the major pluses for me for this series was that Gilbert actually played a major role in the plotline, rather than playing the peripheral character he has mostly occupied in both the earlier miniseries and the books.  And I have to say, it was good to see Anne, for once, putting her entire heart and soul into her devotion to Gil, rather than constantly walking away from his own never-wavering devotion to her.

Finally, let me say that I thought the performances were quite up to the standard set by the earlier miniseries.  Of course, Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie were admittedly more mature than they had been during the earlier miniseries, and that did take some getting used to.  But I also felt that their ages seemed more appropriate to the ages of the characters at this stage in their lives than was sometimes the case with the second sequel.  What did surprise me was how little Schuyler Grant had changed over the years.  That girl must keep the Fountain of Youth in her backyard!

All in all, I was pleasantly surprised with this final installment of Anne of Green Gables.  I honestly felt that the first half truly did reflect a great deal of the charm and ambiance of the earlier miniseries, and while the second half does occasionally strain credulity (Anne has the strangest habit of running into old friends and new acquaintances at the most unbelievably convenient times and in the oddest locations), the story always kept my attention, and in the end, I was glad I hung in there.

For what it's worth, my recommendation is to please do give this one a try, unless you're a dedicated book purist or you cannot bear the idea that favorite characters do grow up and change.  You may or may not be glad you did -- but at least, like me, you'll have made that determination for yourself.",1270857600,3,3565,4.597791798107256

She had no imagination in this movie, and it was a War story that made almost no since.

In this movie she would have been in her early 20's when married to Gill, and their characters looked so much older than they should have.  It was nice to see both actors back thou, and I do applaud Sullivan Entertainment for doing so.  It's just they should have made this movie sooner, than they did.

Third - What was going on?  I felt stupid for not really getting the plot of the movie.  At one point she is holding a child, the next in a conspiracy that made no since.  Dumb one liners thought-out the whole movie, to the point she looked like she was about to kill a Nun for not telling her where her husband was. :-p it's all good, but could have been better.

If you're like me, and never read the books, this show at least ends the Mini Series, and leaves no questions asked about Anne's relationship with Gill, or anything else.  Personally I wouldn't mind a reboot of the series with different actors.  Megan Follows was very good in the role, and I don't think there will hardly be anyone better, but the show could use an update, that way the third movie can be more like the book.  I gave this movie 4 stars only because it was not a bad movie, just not Anne in a way we knew her in the past movies.  If you didn't read the books, then you won't be vastly disappointed in the ending.",1248739200,,2482,4.030674846625767

The worst part (or the most amusing part) was the poor scripting, which ended up being rather funny it was so bad.  When Anne is looking for Gil, she attacks a NUN, reaching over to strangle her while screaming, ""Do you keep a record of the people who have died?""  There are many more memorable bad lines like this.  When London is being bombed, a woman sitting in the shelter asks Anne to remind the baby that ""he learned to tottle while London burned"" while smiling a strange pyscho smile.  I don't know why, but M. Follows' preformance in this movie was so bad, that it was hard to imagine that she had done such a great job in the other two movies.  This movie proves that you can have a top production company, a seasoned director and actors, but a bad script is something that is essential to good story-telling.",1245024000,4,1009,4.39247311827957

There was mention that Anne was unable to attend because she and some of their brood was ill.  So why would Kevin Sullivan write a totally different and unbelievable story in this third installment, in which the characters don't even fit into the time period?  I'm sure he must asked himself that question as well.  The fact he flunked on ""Anne of Green Gables, The Continuing Story"" production doesn't take away from the fact he produced two wonderful Anne of Green Gables productions and a great family friendly TV series based on Avonlea.

First of all, yeah it's nice that they got the same actors to play Anne and Gil, but you feel so horrid seeing them literally 20 years older than when we last saw them, even though it's only supposed to be 5 years since they got engaged, so it's really hard to buy. You FEEL like they've had a 20 year engagement, and it feels sad. I got all nostalgic seeing Green Gables again, but then they have to go ruin it again with showing it inhabited by trash people and run down and neglected. No, no, no!

I didn't feel a connection with Anne's character, either. I saw nothing of the girl that I knew. The things that she does doesn't feel or sound like what Anne would do. She seems kind of...glum.

Thirty minutes into the movie I was confused and discombobulated and bored.  An hour after that I literally felt nauseated.

I don't know if it is worse that this film is not true to the characters or spirit of the first two Sullivan productions or whether it is worse that Sullivan tossed out the entire Lucy Maud Montgomery Anne canon and made up a storyline that is so far beneath all that came before... again, all I can say is I literally felt ill.

That said, I loved it. For the first time Anne and Gilbert are completely in love, and there isn't so much tumultuous fighting. Also, although contrived, the plot is an extremely romantic wartime whirlwind, which thoroughly held my interest. I think it held to the spirit of both Anne and Gilbert, and the fact that they're older and it feels like things have changed with time, makes it all seem more like a genuine life story being lived and  adds this sweet sense of nostalgia and of growing up and moving on.

Not only is the film a betrayal of Anne of Green Gables, but even in its betrayed form, Anne of Green Gables: the Continuing Story is not an interesting story at all. It does not redeem Kevin Sullivan's ridiculous script. The narrative is a common storyline (wife looking for husband in a war-torn world) with terrible acting. I had problems with the 1st sequel since it did not really follow Anne of Avonlea. Sullivan tried to combine Anne of Avonlea and Anne of the Island with bits and pieces from Anne of Windy Poplars. This sequel ONLY worked because the acting was good. The 2nd Sequel, HOWEVER, is even more atrocious. Anne over in Europe? Looking for Gilbert? with a baby named Dominic???? WHERE THE HELL is this story from?

If Kevin Sullivan had a SOUL, he would've made this 2nd Sequel about Anne's House of Dreams. This terrible film leads me to believe that either  A. Kevin Sullivan was desperate for work and thus made this horrendous film
B. Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie were desperate for work since they were now reduced to B-List actors after Anne of Green Gables glory days.

1347399,1,B00004S8JT,"I finally broke down and decided to watch Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story.  For years I have put it off because everyone in my family hated it.  I did not want to see my favorite characters and story lines wrecked beyond belief.  I was not 20 minutes into this version when I realized my worst fears were reality.

The characters were ripped out of their normal timeframe and put into WWI.  It was jarring for me to see the costumes updated by 25 years or so when only 5 years are supposed to have passed.  In the books, it is not Anne and Gilbert who go to war but their grown sons.  Anne and Gilbert's wedding is supposed to be a joyous, intimate, fresh experience.  Marilla is supposed to be there.  I hate the way they changed the timeline.

I also disliked seeing Diana snobby and rich, married to a disillusioned and boring husband.  LMM wrote her as sweet, happily married and settled on a farm.

What was the purpose of burning a hole in Green Gables?  Why was it ever run down in the first place?  It seems to me that Sullivan wanted this movie to be as depressing as possible.  The new character (Garrison?) gets more screen time with Anne than Gilbert does.  I found the interest between Anne and Garrison ridiculous as the ""real"" Anne would never have behaved this way.  Sitting close to him on the train, kissing his head and saying she will always feel Domonique to be their child.  Staying alone with Fred in a suite and then mentioning they are like a married couple.  Again, so far from how Anne would have behaved.  Can you imagine what Marilla or Rachel Lynde would have said?

The political commentary Sullivan interjected into his Anne story must have LMM spinning in her grave.  She wrote these characters (including the women) as proud to serve their country and ready to sacrifice to end the evils of the Kaiser's regime.  Another reviewer mentioned that Sullivan borrowed LMM's characters to write his own story.  This is true, only he does not have the talent of LMM and should not have sullied her characters in this way.

The first two movies were fresh, innocent and a lovely interpretation of the time in which they were set.  This movie is dark, dreary and depressing.  There seems to be no good reason why Anne and Gilbert drag their feet to get married.  When they finally do, it is the most somber wedding I have ever seen.  People crying, tents falling over, a ridiculous minister, depression.  A lot of fans waited a long time to see the continuation of Anne's story only to be met with this disappointment.

I read there were lawsuits going on between Sullivan and LMM's heirs that prohibited Sullivan from using LMM's stories, though he did have the rights to the characters.  If this is true, then it is a shame they did not work things out and give legions of fans the Anne story they deserved and longed for.  Sullivan waited so long that the actors lost the bloom of youth and are hard to believe as young Anne and Gilbert in love.  Sullivan should not have proceeded with this mess.  Better not to attempt a movie at all than to wait so long and then depart so severely from LMM's vision.

It's a shame that we will never see Anne III as it should have been.  Perhaps eventually someone will make more of these stories with a heart for staying true to LMM's charming works.",1210809600,20,3328,4.477537437603993

The character development is excellent; the plot - strong; the story - riveting; even the special effects such as created scenes in Europe, while the whole movie was actually filmed in Canada are amazing!  If you enjoyed the other two ""Anne..."" movies and the main characters, and haven't read the books, I'll bet you'll really like this movie too.

To be fair, it is a movie and I believe it should be rated like any other movie one might watch.  I always hear people bemoaning the fact that movies don't follow books.  A good example is the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.  I have read that novel a couple times and will admit that the movies take liberties with the story and change the general flavor of Middle Earth.  There is so much singing in the various cultures in the LOTR books that the most accurate representation may very well have been movie musicals.  However, I think the overall effort was quite noble, and the movies were outstanding in their own right.",1201651200,5,1329,4.593220338983051

The things that Anne and Gilbert end up doing in this film are what their children are supposed to do!
So it might cost more money to introduce new characters, but as in the books, you don't actually see or hear about most of the older characters anyway, so new characters have to be developed.
They wouldn't have had to cover the whole time of the children growing up, but at least put the story and original characters (Anne and Gilbert) in the correct historical setting.",1198022400,5,667,4.25984251968504

If you like Anne, don't even think of buying this. Don't watch it if you're given it as a present. Don't give it as a present - not even to your worse enemy, because by doing this you would be supporting the terrible people who killed the idea of Anne like this.

So you want to buy it because you really liked the first movie? True, it was good, not really perfect maybe, but still a good one.

You kind of enjoyed the second movie? Yes, it wasn't bad, it had very little to do with the books, but still there was the spirit. Well, some spirit.

But please, don't even think of buying this one! I mean, Anne following Gilbert to Europe to fight in World War I? What on earth is that supposed to mean? Has any of the authors ever heard of how Maud, Anne's ""mother"", totally hated war and how she felt about it?

This movie is absolutely, totally and tragically horrible. It's soppy and nonsensical, its plot is utterly stupid and not even a tiny wee bit close to Anne's spirit.

If you were going to put the actors together, and have a budget for a movie of this size, why would you waste their time and your money to produce this sad thing?  It doesn't follow a hint of the Anne story line, the dialog is really bad, and the story completely breaks apart in the second half of the film with spy plots, kidnapping threats, Anne almost choosing to make a life with another man, and back-stage WWI intrigue as the armistice was signed.  I sat there going ""WHAT??? Where did THAT come from?""

The first half of the movie isn't horrible, and if you're a huge fan of the first movies, or the original actors, or the books...then it's probably worth it to see it, if only for the happy feelings of seeing Anne and Gilbert again.  Yes, they're a lot older than they should be, but it's still great to see them.  Just make sure you can sit down and suspect any expectations you have of what this movie ""should"" be like...because in the second half, it's all downhill.

Mr. Sullivan, this movie is just sad.  How awful that you wasted the chance to put these wonderful actors together again....and why would you choose to skip over the original storyline of Anne and Gilbert's first years together as a married couple?

The great expectations and anticipation that preceeded the the release of ""The Continuing Story"" were unfortunately unjustified, and I set myself up for a bit of a let-down.  Actually, that may be quite an understatement.

The first visual impression was that of ""age,"" especially as the term applies to the actors.  While I expected great things from the anticipated wedding of Gilbert and Anne, such as the event taking place appropriately soon after the beginning of ""The Continuing Story,"" I did not expect the forthcoming disappointment.  What should have been the climactic event of the film was unduly rushed, and it seemed like a mere afterthought as it was presented.  But returning to the theme of ""age,"" Anne, Gilbert, and the collection of former classmates that included Anne's ""bosom friend"" Diana, all appeared to be well into their thirties, not their early twenties.  In other words, ""The Continuing Story"" did a rather poor job of actually accomplishing a seamless continuance.

The story itself was quite improbable, and it was far too long.  I actually found myself squirming, trying to mentally accelerate a story that was mired in continuing intrigues that were definitely far from the thematic peace, love, charm and goodness one would normally associate with Green Gables and Avonlea.",1183334400,14,1505,5.160493827160494

Montgomery left a legacy for Anne, not to mention a mountain of other works, so to create an Anne like this is not only a complete departure from the character her creator wanted her to be, it is a departure from any political or cultural view Montgomery had.

First off, it is supposed to be five years after the second movie, but the actors all look like they have aged 15 years (big shock considering the huge time difference between the making of the 2nd and 3rd films).  It also took me about 1/2 of the movie to reconcile the new deepness of Megan Follows voice with the Anne character (which probably wasn't helped by the fact I had just finished watching the first two movies).  I kept getting pulled out of the movie by the age lines every time a close-up of Anne or Gil appeared.

Second, the relationship between Anne and Fred in London is just creepy.  And the way he looks at her at then end of the movie, with Diana happily preggers beside him, made feel like I needed to take a shower to wash away the ick.

Third, I just didn't like this Anne at all.  She had zero of the dreamy-eyed drama queen quality that made me love the Anne character to begin with.  She was kinda smarmy in the beginning of the movie and I'm not so sure they didn't cut out some love scenes with Anne and Fred and Anne and Jack because I got the distinct feeling that, despite her 'must find Gilbert' mantra, she was not true to her wedding vows.

Last, not enough of the Anne/Gilbert romance.  Come on...that was half of what sold the original two movies, the absolute certainty these two were soul mates!  Where was the wedding!  And why did it take five years to happen?  No way did the Anne and Gil from the first two movies wait five more years to marry!  And then him ship off with the ink barely dry on the marriage certificate, absolutely not!

What was wrong with giving the fans what they wanted, more of Avonlea life with Anne and Gil as a young married couple?",1177891200,38,1935,4.269230769230769
1347432,5,B00004S8JT,"All though it doesn't follow the original books, ""Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story"" is definantly worth watching.

 It begins with our familiar and beloved character Anne, as she goes to New York with Gilbert to see about getting her book published and waits for him to finish his education. As the story progresses, Gil feels the tug and the responsability of war and soon asks Anne to marry him before he is shipped out as doctor in the Canadian army. Soon after he ships out, Gill is posted as missing. It is all Anne can do to stand by and not know if he is dead or alive. The story gains momentum as she suspensfully signs up for red cross and completes a secret mission while looking for Gil and taking care of an old back-stabbing aquaintance's child, and her best friends wounded husband.

  Needless to say, this movie has a lot going on. And I feel that it has a very fitting and heartwarming ending.

  The only thing that I thought was a little out of place, is that Anne and Gilbert didn't start the movie already married. I think that this would have made the continuity of all the stories flow a lot better. Because they are in there early 30's late 20's and facing mature situations, it is hard to think of them taking such a youthfull position as newlyweds. After all, "" Anne of Green Gables the Sequal"" left us feeling that they were realizing how much they were made for one another. It is hard for me to understand them starting off this leg of the story like they are trying to get famliar agian, especially with the time that has gone by. You sort of want to say,"" Aren't they married yet?""

1347450,1,B00004S8JT,"I fell in love with the Anne of Green Gables series when someone loaned us the first movie.  I immediately went out and bought the books and found the 2nd movie that Sullivan made.  The first two movies were outstanding and did an excellent job of telling Montgomery's story of Anne.

Like many other fans of Anne, I anxiously awaited the third movie, hoping to see the marriage of Anne and Gilbert and the beginning of their married life and the starting of their family.  There is wonderful drama in the books of this period of their lives.  I thought, too, that a final movie would be very successful if it dealt with the wartime drama situated around Anne & Gilbert's oldest daughter, Rilla.

What Sullivan presented, however, after two wonderful movies, was not only a desecration of Montgomery's writings, but also just a bad movie.  If you have recently discovered Anne of Green Gables and love these tremendous stories, I strongly recommend that you buy the first two movies.  By staying close to the text, Sullivan managed to deliver two incredible movies, and Meegan Follows is simply incredible.

Based upon Sullivan's commentary's in the movies, however, we should consider ourselves lucky he got these movies right, because he really doesn't seem to ""get"" what makes Montgomery's stories so wonderful.  This is even more apparent with the 3rd movie, which I can only guess Sullivan put out there to try and make some extra money.  First of all, it has nothing to do with Montgomery's actual stories.  Sullivan should have kept to directing and left story telling to Montgomery.  Second, the movie is just bad.  It was a couple of hours that, unfortunately, I'll never get back again.

As other reviewers have commented, I own the first two movies and love to watch them with my family.  They are *perfect* family movies with incredible stories and superb acting.  The last movie shouldn't even be considered part of the story.  It's bad.  Don't waste any money on it.",1164153600,55,1980,4.821958456973293

1347453,1,B00004S8JT,"I fell in love with the ""Anne of Green Gables"" movies when I was a little girl because of they were such lovely interpretations of the L.M. Montgomery books. Meagan Follows IS Anne Shirley. When I found out that a third installment of the series was coming out, I could not wait. However, what I received left a very bad taste in my mouth. ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" was horrible! The story was terrible and did not live up to the previous installments that drew you in to the story. With this film, I really didn't care about the characters the way I had in the past. The only thing I did care about was the fact that Anne and Gil were FINALLY together, but was still disappointed by their rushed wedding - something I had been waiting for for a very long time. I don't think that we, as fans, had the opportunity to really enjoy their wedding the way we had always imagined we would. I also hated the fact that the character of Jack and his son, in a way, came between Anne and Gil. Sometimes I felt like Anne was cheating on Gil with her interactions with Jack. I wanted to see Anne and Gil have their own children and raise them in the wonderfully heartwarming way they were raised, not with all of the melodrama of WWI.

I truly wish that a better ending to an extraodinary series could have been made, but I guess I'll make do with the first two movies. I can't say enough great things about those films!

The only reason I am giving this film one star - I would like to give it zero - is because some of the original cast is back. It was great to see Anne, Gil, and Dianna once again!

If you are a fan of ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" (aka ""Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel""), don't bother purchasing this last installment. Although I'm sure you will want to see what happened to all of your favorite characters, your hopes will certainly be dashed and disappointed by a poor story and poor dialogue.",1162771200,43,1943,4.260162601626016
1347454,1,B00004S8JT,"If there was a way to go back in time and NOT watch this movie, I would do it in a heartbeat. I am so disappointed there are not words to express it. I am usually less critical of movie versions of favorite books than most of my friends... but this movie broke my heart with its awfulness. I couldn't figure out how to give it zero stars... but if I could have, I would have.

The entire Anne of Green Gables series is my favorite series of books. I have read them all dozens of times. I always say that I have a hard time deciding which is my favorite - the first or the last. If they had to put Anne and Gilbert in a WWI movie (her children fought in the war, not Gilbert)... WHY oh WHY couldn't they have used storylines from Rilla of Ingleside? The Anne I know and love is a dreamer. The third movie takes her ""impetuous"" nature (which she outgrows by her Redmond years, mostly) and runs with it... and completely ignores the aspect of Anne that is clever, and witty, and... kindred spirit-y. The Anne in this movie is NOT of the ""race that knows Joseph.""

I hated this movie so much that I won't even resell it to get it out of my house... then someone else would have to be subjected to it and I couldn't forgive myself for that. It just breaks my heart to have the first two movies desecrated by this 3rd... movie, for lack of a better word.

DON'T see it if you love LM Montgomery as I do. Navigate away from this site and order the book Rilla of Ingleside instead. You'll be incredibly glad you did!",1160611200,12,1508,4.139931740614334
1347455,3,B00004S8JT,"Is that you can skip the parts you don't like much faster than fast forwarding on video.

I mention this because I did a lot of that with The Continuing Story. I absolutely loved the scenes between Ann and Gilbert and that alone made it worth the purchase. It was wonderful to see them so openly affectionate with each other.

The chemistry between Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie was even better than Anne of Avonlea, perhaps because the two actors had matured as their characters had. It made Ann and Gilbert's love for each other palpable and very romantic. As Ann didn't hesitate to say, she was scandalously in love with him and I believed it.

The storyline with Jack Garrison did not thrill me and when Ann tells him toward the end of the movie that she would always think of his son as theirs, it was very un-Ann like to me. It seemed as though she was being unfaithful to Gilbert in a small way. Maybe I'm picking nits, but it was the one scene I really disliked.

On the plus side, many of the characters from the first two Ann movies made appearances and it was startling to see how much they'd aged. I do admit that I wish Rachel Lynde had been more a part of the story and was certainly surprised not to see her at Ann and Gilbert's wedding. And where were Gilbert's parent's?

While I was disappointed that the movie didn't have a wedding night for Ann and Gilbert, because the scene was ultimately cut, it did show up in the extras as a deleted scene. So that made me happy.

I've read and re-read, and re-read her stories again and again, and can't seem to get enough.  The first two film installments in the Anne of Green Gables story are warm, beautiful, funny, inspiring and moving pieces of work, that are more or less faithful to Montgomery's original novels.

The third installment is a travesty.

Anachronism, bad dialogue, bad plot and plain old bad acting plague this ""sequel"".  I say ""sequel"" in quotes, because the thing I dislike the most about the movie is the fact that the storyline is a complete departure from what Montgomery had envisioned for Anne so long ago.  What a way to end it.

That said, I've decided to purchase only the first two installments, and leave the third alone.

It was banal, boring, and for someone who really loves Anne, a travesty.

Only get this movie if you know nothing about Anne of Green Gables or L. M. Montgomery.

1347459,3,B00004S8JT,"Let's face facts. This movie sucked. It was so corny, I couldn't stand it anymore. Let me just say here that I love the first two Anne of Green Gables movies to death. I love the story, the characters (one of the best played-out romances on film, no doubt) and the romance. But in this movie, there were so many Anne/Gilbert make-out scenes that I was pretty much grossed out early on in the film. The dialogue between them was kinda corny and quite repetitive too. Finally, all those moral dillemas that Gilbert had to go through in the hospital were quite ridiculous. As for Jack Garrison, he was just another man who fell for Anne, but he was all right. I neither like nor dislike him.

I was also disappointed that there wasn't enough of the wedding scene either. We go through all this trouble of waiting years for this movie to come out and for Anne and Gilbert to finally get together and the wedding scene wasn't even three minutes long? I feel gypped here.

The only good things about this movie were that the main characters did an excellent job of acting, regardless of how bad the movie was. That and the scene when Anne and Gilbert find each other in Germany is just beautiful. Oh, and Gilbert's incredibly good looking too.

So that's my personal opinion of this movie. It gets 3 stars for the excellent acting, the adoption of Dominic at the end, and the reunion of Anne and Gilbert. I'll still watch it, but only with a grim look on my face.

1347463,1,B00004S8JT,"I'd second most of what's been said in the other reviews here--that it's nothing like the books and hasn't much of the magic of the first two movies.  Actually it's outright depressing.  And, it's a betrayal of LM Montgomery's books--it's kind of like seeing all the actors from the previous two movies playing different characters in a movie unrelated to anything she wrote.  It's kind of surreal and puzzling, not to mention BORING.  There's no sense to the plot--what the heck was the point of writing in as part of the screenplay Anne going to New York?  That entire section seemed totally irrelevant.  If Kevin Sullivan was going to depart from the books so completely, he might have tried to write something with at least a little internal coherence instead of a series of lackluster scenes without any overlying themes.

Since the characters are all 13 years older than in the movie before, there are some inevitable changes.  One of these that I can't get over is Anne's voice, which is much deeper.  She hardly smiles at all in this movie and it's no wonder because it's dang depressing the whole way through, with this dark overtone as in any war movie.

The extra half star over one that I'd like to give this are for the acting, which is pretty decent; Megan Follows particularly I think has improved as an actress.  Also Anne's hair isn't ridiculously and artificially bouffant like in the 2nd movie; it's just the right size and color.  Gilbert Blythe is much cuter in this movie than in the other two (the first one he had this strange perm, the second he still had baby fat on his face), and his chemistry with Anne is much more believable here too--in the second movie they seemed so asexual, whereas here their passion for each other is evident and I can actually imagine that they'd have enough sex to produce the huge brood Anne does in the books.

All in all a disappointment and also a movie that, because of how it strays so completely from the timeline of the books, makes it near impossible to make another sequel based on Rilla of Ingleside or other stories of Anne's children.",1149206400,14,2103,4.620967741935484

Secretly, men are gluttons for true romance, and I am no exception, so I ""reluctantly"" agreed. But this movie was unendurable. Far from the living room, I fiddled with other reading, but I couldn't help thinking about what sort of audience the writer was aiming for. As a stand-alone movie, it's simply terrible. So I assumed that it was just about sequel money. But it failed miserably as a sequel too. As I reviewed the reviews of reviewers more literate about the Anne literature, I also noticed the sprinkling of +positive+ reviews. Then I got distracted with answering the question: ""who could possibly write a positive review like this?""

1347465,1,B00004S8JT,"Having enjoyed the first two installments of the Anne saga, I was deeply disappointed with ""The Continuing Story.""

I expected to be re-introduced to the characters that I came to love. I expected to feel the same warmth and delight unique to the first two Kevin Sullivan films. Instead I found next to nothing reminiscent of Anne of Green Gables or Anne of Avonlea.  The story was moved from Prince Edward Island and relocated to war-riddled Europe in the midst of calamity and conflict.  Gilbert is sent to war and ends up missing in action.  Anne spends 90% of the movie searching for him amidst bombings, wounded soldiers, orphaned children, and every other depressing scenario peculiar to a war zone.  This is too big of a departure from the series and from the sequel long expected by Anne of Green Gables fans.  If Sullivan had wanted to make a war film, he should have done that, however, absent the Green Gables franchise.

I expected first of all that the setting would remain in Canada...Prince Edward Island, Halifax, etc.  Secondly, although I, quite naturally, expected Anne to have matured, I thought I'd still see the same irrepressible, colorful Anne that made her such a delightful character.  Instead she wanders through Europe on a search for Gilbert; and set against the gray and melancholy backdrop of war, there's no opportunity for her to be the quaint and eloquent Anne we came to know and love.

Sullivan's first two Anne films were perfect ""feel good"" family movies, but he strayed too far from a flawless formula with this one.  This movie was depressing, long, and cumbersome.  Since the essential elements in this film are so far removed from the first two Anne adventures, it, therefore, can not be considered a sequel or a continuing story. Nevertheless, in the end Sullivan takes us back to Avonlea, and we find that Green Gables is in ruins; and although there's some semblance of Anne's former home, we don't feel that we've returned to Green Gables.

This movie lacks the warmth, the imagination, the beautiful scenery, the amusing dialogue, and the uniqueness of the characters that Lucy Maud Montgomery created.",1148342400,14,2149,4.887052341597796
1347466,1,B00004S8JT,"As a huge Lucy Maud Montgomery/Anne of Green Gables fan, I truly enjoyed the first two Megan Follows Anne of Green Gables movies. The first movie stuck mostly to the book and was really wonderful. The second movie was a combination of several of the subsequent Anne books, and sticks less to the original stories but none the less is an enjoyable view and true to the books in most majorly important areas. The third movie was a bit of a disaster with plot, setting, and events totally fabricated and not at all from the books. YIKES! DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW INFO ON THE ANNE OF GREEN GABLES BOOKS BEFORE FINISHING READING THEM YOURSELF. (Though I highly recommend reading all the books in the series before watching any movie versions.) In reality, Anne does not go on to do anything exceptional by the world's standards. Montgomery chooses NOT to have her go on to become a great author. Instead she becomes a loving wife and mommy and her adventures continue to be Anne-like and focus on meeting new people and winning them over with her unaltered charm. She enjoys some occasional match-making. She and Gilbert eventually have a rather large brood of children and are happy and content in the normal everydayness of life. The stories are really very sweet and satisfying but not exactly the greatest movie material. The last two novels (Rainbow Valley and Rilla of Ingleside) focus almost exclusively on the lives and times of her children. However, this third Megan Follows movie has Anne embarking on an adventure in wartime Europe in search of Gilbert who left for Europe shortly after their wedding. Anne meets up with Diana's husband, Fred, who has been wounded and joins Anne in her quest to find Gilbert. At one point, Fred subtly suggests that they give up the search for Gilbert and just become a family themselves. Okay...ICK!  It ends with Gilbert and Anne adopting a war baby who had been under Anne's charge while she was searching for her missing husband in Europe. They hand over Green Gables to Diana and her emotionally-wrecked husband and plan to settle elsewhere and raise the little boy as their own. Someone behind this movie has a very active imagination. It is almost all completely made up. The final book, Rilla of Ingleside, does take place during wartime, but Anne's sons, not her husband, go off to war. Her teenage daughter, Rilla, does help to raise an infant whose mother dies and whose father is away at war.  However, this does not result in any adoption as the baby's father eventually returns to claim him. If you don't mind its almost total departure from anything having to do with the books, I guess this film can be entertaining. I just think it is such a shame that many people fall in love with Anne after reading Anne of Green Gables but never read the rest of the books in the series. Then they watch the Megan Follows movies and are walking around this earth thinking that her story ends with a wartime adventure for Gilbert and Anne who then settle down to raise their adopted son! It's sad, really. The only way I would recommend someone to see this film is if they can't get enough of Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie and cannot rest until they see them get married on the screen, even if they event itself, and more significantly, the events that follow, are remarkably different from L.M. Montgomery's books. Do read all 8 Anne books and do see the first 2 Megan Follows movies. I think you will find that they are worth your time and money!",1147737600,18,3514,4.6208
1347467,1,B00004S8JT,"This installment is a disaster.  If you are a fan of the Anne books, don't bother - the only reason to watch this is that some of the cast were reunited.

There is absolutely nothing in this tale that comes from the Anne books, and one has to wonder why they bothered to make it at all, except perhaps to satisfy a wistful demand for another sequel from the tv audience.  The cast have noticeably aged, and this forces the need for some grown-up behavior onto them.  This wouldn't be so bad except that the goings-on really don't seem to be in character, and the overall tone of the film is anything but lighthearted.  Nearly the whole thing takes place during, and focuses on, WWII.

The piece begins by establishing loud and clear that after five years, Gil and Anne still haven't managed to get married, and there's no date in sight.  Gil gets a job offer from a hospital in NYC that cares more about its reputation than the good of its patients, and Anne goes with him and gets an editing job at a publishing firm.  The firm's star author is a predictable rogue named Jack Garrison who swipes the manuscript for her latest work, and convinces her to let him co-author it.  Fancy the surprise when the book comes in with only his name on it.

From here, Anne and Gilbert go back home to find Green Gables fallen into disrepair under the care of a slovenly family, from whom Gilbert buys the place.  He wrestles with his conscience about joining the war effort as all of their male friends sign up and leave and hint that Gil is a coward, and he finally does join.  He and Anne then have a rushed wedding a few days before he leaves for Europe.

The remaining tedious 75% of this tale has Anne running around France trying to find Gilbert after her letters to him are returned as undeliverable, and on top of this she runs into writer-turned-spy/agent Jack Garrison and is saddled with his illegitimate child when his girlfiend is killed.  The only reason we bothered to watch the end of it was to see how much worse it could get.  There is one 10-second redeeming scene at the end when Anne wins custody of Jack's now-orphaned son, whom she hasn't seen in a year, and she picks him up at the train station in a scene reminiscent of her own arrival.  The kid is a cutie and the scene is a touching return to the style and feel of the books - too bad the creators of this film didn't think it was worth sticking to for the rest of the story.",1145232000,9,2442,4.334065934065934

In my opinion, Kevin Sullivan saw that the popularity of the first 2 beloved movies was still strong, and decided to capitalize on it.  But instead of understanding that the reason people loved the first 2 movies was the simple elegance and innocence of the story telling and setting, he decided to take the ""Hollywood"" route, and make a war & violence tale.  I guess following the stories in the book series (Anne & Gilbert get married, settle down, have a bunch of kids) was too boring, and didn't have the $ making potential for Mr. Sullivan.  It's a shame, in the quest for the almighty dollar, he let down a lot of fans.",1139616000,12,723,4.462121212121212

I wasn't even going to watch the first one, but found myself falling for the characters as it played on our TV.  Perhaps some of the other reviewers would have preferred a more conservative Anne, but I found this Anne to be an excellent snapshot of a mature woman who has come into her own, and who is simply NOT content with just being a married woman and doting mother (which is fine for those who want that).  Follows shows an Anne who is still very youthful at heart, but who grows so much by the end of this movie.

Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie took the characters they brought to life and breathed an adult life into them with this film.  Often, when actors return to characters they played years before, you can tell they were just doing it for the money.  Not with these two.  They presented characters that have grown since we last saw them - characters that time has touched, but still remain true to their core.

The writing is superb and the acting is excellent.  The transformation that the characters take in this movie simply must be seen.  Kevin Sullivan, Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie, and the rest should be extremely proud of this film.

As pointed out by other reviewers, the only similarity with the previous films are the actors portraying Anne and Gilbert, and even in this the chemistry they had shown in the first two films is totally lacking here.

Aside from that, there were so many ludicrous scenes that it was actually embarrassing to watch at times:  Do the makers of this film actually believe that Anne is capable of pulling out the slugs of ammunition with her bare hands and making a bomb from the gunpowder? and that the VIEWER will believe it?  Are you kidding me?  Have you ever tried to do that (not that I'd recommend you try it).  Do the makers of this film actually believe that of all of the thousands of railroad cars that she could jump into that were travelling throughout war torn Europe, the one that she jumped into also had as a passenger the one man in America who was hitting on her?  Come on you guys, how gullible do you take us viewers to be!?

I didn't buy into any of the plot devices used to gain our interest and I wasn't captured by any of the acting.

1347487,1,B00004S8JT,"In the previous installment of Kevin Sullivan series of ""Anne"" movies, Gilbert Blythe convinces Anne Shirley that if she wants to write a book that might actually get published, she should stop writing the ""high-faluting mumbo-jumbo"" stories that she had attempted for years, and write simple stories about the life and people she already knew -- people like Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde.  Anne finally came to realize that Gilbert was right.  Oddly, Kevin Sullivan thought Gilbert was wrong.  The result was one of the most horridly depressing movies I have ever endured: ""Anne of Green Gables -- The Continuing Story.""

The first two ""Anne"" movies were pure romance: they depicted (to slightly misquote the Cervantes character in ""Man of La Mancha"") ""Life, not as it is, but as it should be.""  Sullivan apparently wanted to leave such ""childish"" things behind, and produce an ""adult"" movie about Anne -- one with cynicism and violence and at least the possibility of illicit sex.  What he came up with was so foreign to the first two movies, and so ugly, that it should simply be flushed like all the rest of the... well, you know what gets flushed.

Think of the cinematography.  The first two movies were so visually beautiful that they could bring tears to the eyes simply though the scenery.  The colors were rich and bright and warm, and it seems the sun always shone.  The scene in the first ""Anne"" where Matthew brought Anne to Green Gables down the lane through the flowering orchard (""The Avenue"") was as beautiful as any scene I have ever seen in any move, ever.  Even the winter scenes were beautiful!  In real life, of course, Canadian winters are brutal.  But the Anne movies were romance: life, not as it is, but as it should be.  On the other hand, ""The Continuing Story"" seemed to be filmed in one color, a dead and ugly gray.  Sullivan undoubtedly thought that was more adult and more realistic.  He was wrong; it was simply ugly.

And consider the characters.  Sullivan apparently thought it necessary to include at least the possibility of illicit sex.  Certainly Anne comes close to adultery with that Jack Garrison character.  When thus tempted, the ""real"" Anne -- the one from the the first two movies -- could only have one response: ""There can never be anyone for me but Gilbert.""  That line, perhaps the most gloriously unrealistic, purely romantic line ever spoken in a movie, was what Gilbert said in the second movie, when he was explaining to Anne why he broke off his engagement with Christine Stewart: he could love only Anne.  And Anne could love only Gilbert.  That Anne did not tell Jack that in this misbegotten movie proves that it wasn't really Anne.  They called her Anne, and the got Megan Follows to play her, but it wasn't Anne.  It was a different character.

This movie deserves a lot less than one star.  Do not buy it.  It is really nothing but a lot of high-faluting mumbo-jumbo, as Gilbert said.  Kevin Sullivan should have known better.",1135209600,46,3003,4.743243243243243

Yet at the same time it does go well with the first 2 movies, it follows along with how far the producer drifted from the orginal book in the original movie as well as the second movie Anne Of Avonlea which just drifted even further from the books. So it truly was no wonder that the final movie was only sort of loosely based upon characters similar to those LM Montgomery once wrote about.

I had to give this movie 3 stars though because ""if"" you had never read the books and only knew of the tale of Anne and Gil by the first movie and then the sequel you would probably enjoy this movie very much. They did a great job in keeping the portrayers of the characters in the first and second movie, not only did Megan Follows return as Anne, but Gilbert returned as well as Diana and Fred, a rare thing given the time which had passed from the sequel to the filming of the third movie.

About halfway through the movie, I had the most confused look on my face.  Sure these were the same characters, and the same great actors portraying them, but what in the world is this story about?

I was looking forward to having this third movie pick up where the last one left off or at least keep true to the books by L.M.M.

However; as we were expecting it to be as close to the original book as the previous movies were, we were both grievously disappointed and had to force ourselves to continue to watch it to the bitter end.

This movie has none of the charm and none of the warmth of the original.  In fact, it is such a departure from ""Anne of Green Gables"" that it really doesn't seem like part of Anne's story at all.  Every action seems out of character for all involved and the storyline is too ludicrous to be belived.  Even if this had been a movie that was separate from ""Anne of Green Gables"" this movie would not be worth seeing at all.  There is absolutely nothing about this movie to recommend it to anyone, even for an Anne fan like myself.  It's downright boring.

  Anne (Megan Follows) returns to Green Gables and meets with Diana (Schuyler Grant).  Anne is so overwhelmed to see the green, fresh land she grew up on. She can't wait to see the house that was her steady home with Marilla.  The house was sold years ago.

But I still wonder why in the world they didn't follow the storyline from the books better (remember, the first original films didn't really follow the books but they were much more cautious and respectful to Lucy Maud Montgomery's work). They could have easily followed (at the very least) ""Anne's House of Dreams"" about life after Gilbert and Anne were married (speaking of which, Anne and Gil may as well 'eloped'. It sure felt like it because of their 'speedy' wedding...RIDICULOUS!). I guess the writers, producers...etc were 'nervous' that *if* they 'did' follow the original storyline, it wouldn't be as ""exciting"" as a WWI topic they pulled (which twisted the series around). I guess to them, watching things blow up is more exciting than watching couple of women drink tea. They have to remember that the reason why the first two were so popular was because the movie didn't follow the 'protocol' of excitement that so many of us are fed these days with the technology in movies. Had they kept the storyline from the books as they should have done, the ratings here could have been MUCH different.
A little additional note... 'we' Gilbert/Anne romance fans would have happily overlooked missing the actual wedding between the two characters in place where we could see their life after the ceremony with Gilbert's first years of him being a doctor and Anne's life while meeting new characters. It certainly would have been better.

One thing that absolutely BOTHERED me to no end was how they made Diana's husband and Anne too close for comfort. I simply didn't feel the 'passion' Gilbert and Anne had together in this film as when they last left us in a embrace at the end of the second movie. That in itself was a insult to the whole series and the many many years of fans discovering these wonderful books. And mostly, it's a slap in the face to Lucy Maud Montgomery!

I truly hope that SOMEONE who was in charge (or can be in charge) see these reviews and reconsider remaking another finale Green Gables movie where they can bypass their blatant mistake of this one. And to create a final movie that all of us fans deserve and what the book series deserves.

HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF THAT?!?!?! I'm sick and tired of people wanting movies to go buy the book, every page, every line, every word. So what if this film doesn't go buy the book? I'm sure the author wouldn't have mind at all because this should of been what really happened to all the characters from the stories. This film is touching, compelling, and real adventure for the young and young at heart. I really enjoyed it.

The story takes place during the 20th century at the time of WWI, and Anne (Meagan Follows, The Nutcracker Prince, Murder She Wrote) has just come home from college to Prince Edward Island. She meets her childhood friend Diana (Schuyler Grant) who takes her home to her family in her new house and car, where she meets her old friends. While at the beach, she meets her fiance Gilbert (Johnathan Crombie), who invites her to come to New York City where he could work as a doctor while Anne should work as an author. So, they came to the city, where Anne has success writing her book, but it is published by the boss of her company instead of hers! This makes Anne very angry, and is relieved when Gilbert tells her that they're going home back to Green Gables. When they get to the house, memories come rushing back to Anne. Times when she was with Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst, who died after the second Anne film), Diana, and Matthew. They begin to restore the house, but the news of war in Europe begin to send many of the Canadians to fight, including Diana's husband and Gilbert, but not before he marries Anne. Four years have passed, and many of the men who fought in Europe have been missing in action or died. Anne is worried about Gilbert, who hasn't been answering her letters. So she sets off to find him. Will she find Gilbert? Is he alive? And will things return back to normal after the war is over?

This film has so much emotion to it. The actors really put their heart and soul to make this film. And has some of today's issues put into the film, such as Diana's line to her husband, ""Your family is more important than your country."" I bet a lot of wives said the same thing to their husbands.

I'd started watching it about a week ago, and didn't finish it until last night--that's how uninterested I was by it. I would definitely recommend buying the first two Anne movies, and just ignore the 3rd, if you can. i still haven't bought the second movie yet--that's just my luck ;) but this is really absolute crap, the 3rd film!",1122854400,11,888,4.291666666666667

Although it was good to see the main characters, Anne and Gilbert, marry, the Continuing Story is so far removed from the previous stories that viewers will find it difficult to connect them. The richness and wonder found in the first two films are totally absent in the final.  After watching Continuing Story, I immediately threw it in the trash, then watched the first two again, and ""pretended"" the third didn't exist.",1122163200,6,552,4.680412371134021
1347503,3,B00004S8JT,"The first two movies in the Anne of Green Gables saga were richly engaging. With this installment, however, something seems to be missing. While it's really good to see the old familiar places and people its a little tough at first to settle into the flow of this story.
We've departed from Lucy Montgomery's novels and gone off into a fabricated new adventure patched together by the director. We've jumped twenty years in time, which is a bit much. We're supposed to believe that this story is taking place when Anne and Gill are in their late twenties or early thirties. It's hard to reconcile this with the time period in which the first movies took place. We've fast forwarded to World War I, but none of the characters have quite aged properly it seems. In the books Anne's children are involved in the war, not Anne herself. The director uses clips from the old movies to tie them into this one, and we're supposed to think they happened twenty years later than they did. Dates aside the movie is visually interesting to look at. The costumes and sets are stunning. This at least keeps things interesting as the story deteriorates on multiple levels.
The first half of the movie opens with Anne returning to Avonlea to a wealthy Diana and rundown Green Gables. She and Gil have been engaged for at least ten years or more which would have been bizarre then. All the actors seem to effectively recapture their characters and we can accept them as the people we know from the other movies. Avonlea is changed though and the charm and humor of the first movies, and even the Avonlea television series is virtually gone.
Anne and Gil soon move to New York together so Gil can pursue his career as a surgeon. Anne works as an editor for a publishing house, all the while writing a novel of her own. We see a few predictable events, Anne's work is stolen, and Gil is asked to compromise his integrity in order to gain prestige. Disillusioned and dejected, they return to Avonlea to renew a life together. Soon Gil goes off to war, he disappears and Anne goes off to find him.
The story moves at a choppy pace with the resolution of some conflicts being glossed over a little too quickly. For instance, in New York Anne collaborates on a novel called 'Kindred Spirits' with Jack Garrison, the golden boy of the publishing house where she works. The idea is that his name will make her famous and her talent will revive his dying career. Predictably Anne gets no credit for her work and drama ensues. A few scenes later, we see Anne working at her desk and we see a stack of books bearing the title 'Kindred Spirits by Anne Shirley'. We are left to assume that everything eventually worked itself out. This is kind of anti-climactic as it was such a major plot point in the first part of the movie.
The final twenty minutes of the movie feel the same way. Anne and Gil are trying to find a missing child Anne promised to care for. This in and of itself could have made for an hour's worth of story telling but it is condensed to a few rushed scenes that feel anything but natural. Suddenly everything is resolved and the movie is over. Perhaps the script was originally much longer and had to chopped to fit time constraints.
Overall the movie tries to get off to a good start but falls apart towards the end as too many different plot threads are wrapped up in a small space of time and some not at all. It all feels like it ends too soon.  Still, it's good to see old characters and places, even if they don't seem to quite fit. It's nice to finally see that Gil and Anne do get married and there seems to be some closure to the saga. What would have been wonderful would have been to pick up the story as Lucy Montgomery told it, and followed it through World War I from there.",1121904000,3,3779,4.429597701149425
1347504,1,B00004S8JT,"I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere, felt so sad.",1121817600,5,190,4.457142857142857
1347505,1,B00004S8JT,"In a time when wars, poverty, AIDS, 9/11 and murders dominate the headlines, I have always turned to Anne of Green Gables as a sweet escape reminiscent of of simpler times and honest romance.  I loved that Anne and Gilbert didn't fly into each other's arms without a struggle and that their love was based on faithful friendship and years of becoming ""kindred spirits""...the third installment of these movie series smashed all feelings of endearment for me...I could barely watch it!  I'm not a prude, but I couldn't help but cringe when Anne became almost TOO close with Diana's husband in Europe and seemed ready to hop into bed with an obvious cad.  I didn't believe for a minute that she was happy Gilbert was alive at the end - I almost thought she wished he would just disappear into the dust of WWI.  There was so much terrific material from the books - why depart from them so severely?  I was sorely let down by the wedding scene too - she seemed almost depressed to be marrying Gilbert.  I had to watch the first two all over again to feel reunited with the characters and Anne's spunky sense of awe...YUCK...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...just use your imagination to envision a third movie.",1121472000,10,1196,4.617924528301887
1347506,4,B00004S8JT,"Not having read the books but only having seen the two movies made by the same producer, I must admit that this movie is a great divergence from the other two.  I found that Anne held her tongue when she should have given someone a lashing.  I also found that she did not find the good in situations where she had done so in the previous two installments.  However, given the nature of this movie, she did not have time to reminisce at all.

Megan Follows was 30 when this was filmed... so the idea that a few years has passed was not that believeable.  Her voice did not have the youthful exuberance it did in the first two films.  And the script didn't give this much of a chance.

I fully agree with other reviews that this movie was an action movie.  From my standpoint, it was written for financial reasons more than anything.  The idea that it was to bring ""closure"" was simply not convincing.

Finally, being a great fan of Megan Follows, I thought the film did stand on its own.  It was riveting and the character of Anne was a bulwark.  She was believeable as a grown up Anne Shirley who would let nothing stand in the way of what she knew to be her duty.  Anne was unwilling to compromise her principles no matter what... which is what drew me to these films in the first place.  The world is lacking in heroes (and heroines) such as this... everything has become relative to the situation.

I enjoyed the film.  Not so much as the first two, but it was enjoyable just the same.  I'm sorry Anne ""purists""... but this is all fiction anyhow... so just enjoy it.",1119398400,3,1569,4.318493150684931
1347507,2,B00004S8JT,"When I heard Anne of Green Gables, the Sequel was coming out, I couldn't wait for more of the story. I was sorely disappointed when the entire Redmond years were left out - my favorite book was ""Anne of the Island"" - with all the chumminess and camraderie of Patty's Place. I glossed over ""Anne of Windy Poplars"" to get to Anne and Gilbert's wedding - FINALLY. The Sequel focused primarily and LOOSELY on ""Windy Poplars,"" however, and WAS the middle-aged Morgan Harris supposed to appease us for Roy Gardner?

When Anne of Green Gables, the Continuing Story came out I couldn't wait to see Anne and Gilbert finally together and in their ""House of Dreams..."" WELL, WWI happened, and while I could've reasonably gotten caught up in that with the beloved characters(instead of their children), I was disappointed. The wedding was a somber and short affair, Diana's unhappy marriage was demoralizing, and once AGAIN, we only had the enjoyment of Anne and Gil together at the very beginning and the very end.

What hurt the most was the ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE departure in having Anne care so much for Jack???  After yearning to see more of her and Gilbert together, I can hardly bear to watch it. When the armistice came, she mentioned Jack; on the way home from Europe, she was still obsessing over Jack and his son. Could we have had an ""Oh, Gilbert, I'm so glad you are safe and what would I have done without you, the love of my life""? The movie left us feeling like she would've happily picked up life with Jack and his son instead.

There were parts that I loved, and it was wonderful to see everyone again. I think all the characters have aged beautifully. I admit to liking this movie better than the Sequel, but I was sorry to see such a departure - again - from the books when there is such a plethora of wonderful stories to choose from there.",1119225600,7,1851,4.54954954954955

Instead of staying true to Lucy Maud Montgomery's story, Anne and Gilbert go off to the war, the war their children were actually fighting.  Instead of seeing Anne and Gilbert settle into family life with their children, the writers instead made up this crazy movie with so many plots and basically a lot of chaos. It was so sad to watch this movie knowing that they had officially ruined the Anne of Green Gables trilogy.  Sadly too, the movie was made so many years after the second one that Anne looks very aged.  It would have been much more appropriate to follow her family life and watch her children growing and all the great adventures they had.",1119139200,10,757,4.5777777777777775
1347509,1,B00004S8JT,"I loved the Anne series and ""Rilla of Ingelside"" was my favourite. This book was BUTCHERED in this movie. Walter (Anne's son) was one of my favourite characters and ""Rilla of Ingelside was really touching. This movie saw Gilbert fight rather than Jem, Shirley and Walter (All Anne's sons). It was terrible!

If the main characters were not called Anne and Gilbert there would be no way to tell this was a sequel of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" movies. It has completely left the Montgomery style and lacks depth. New characters were introduced (whom never existed in the books) and Anne was CHANGED. I felt disappointed that the producer chose to completely ignore Montgomery's ending to the Anne series for a trashy story of WWI. Especially since Montgomery wrote ""Rilla of Ingleside"" soon after the war, hence the book has some historical value. The movie gets historical events wrong.

I unfortunatley purchased this movie believing it would be ok but I recommend you save your money because fans of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series will hate it. If you really want to see it rent it because otherwise you most likely will never watch it again.

This is completely different to Montgomery's writings so if Montgomery is one of your favourite authors you will be disappointed by the way the movie changes events, characters and chronological order.

As many others have pointed out in the reviews the relationship between Gilbert and Anne is very disappointing. Also Anne adopts a child and goes looking for Gilbert who is missing during the war! All these things have abandoned the story Montgomery told of Anne.",1117324800,12,1614,4.87956204379562

I say this because, I noticed that the people who gave this third movie the most stars said they have not read the books. These films exist as ""Literature into Film""; therefore, they are not just movies to view to pass the time. These films (1 and 2) are so popular, because they gave us the characters as presented in the books. Yes, even the second film leaves out characters and deviates from sub-plots, but the essence of the Avonlea people is kept in tact, as well as Anne's charm. This 3rd installment... why was it even made?  I have to watch 1 and 2 all over just to find my Anne again. If you loved the first 2 films, then you SHOULD read the rest of the novels (starting with Anne of Green Gables), and then only watch this third installment if you are the type who craves disappointments.

It will brand lasting and scarring memories of  the beloved red-head dreamer, and leave you with a relativistic and dissullusioned Anne.

 You know something is wrong when Diane emerges at the beginning of the plot: a rich, materialistic, socialite, who, of course, has marital problems with Fred( Who mysteriously changed from being a short, brown-haired, stout schoolboy in Anne of Avonlea, to a tall, blond-haired skinny recluse)

It only goes downhill from there with a sequence of events that will leave this movie in Bi-mart's dollar movie bin. The plot is as hard to catch as Gilbert is. The action-packed adventure scenes mimic the near-escape-with-death feel that belong better in Mission impossible, as Anne chugs vodka in a nun habit, ignites a hand-made bomb, and smuggles jewels out of the country.

 The only part of the movie that holds some truth is where Anne, in the end, tells the love struck but disheartened Garrison that not all dreams come true. For all the disillusioned Anne Fans out there, ""Anne-the continuing story"", is living proof.",1114300800,16,1379,5.0

Plus, Anne and Gilbert look to be about 35.  Avoid seeing this movie - it is a waste of three hours of your life, and it doesn't actually in any way continue the story of Anne or Gilbert or anyone else.

However, the performances of both Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie were both heartfelt and flawles, and one still revels in Anne's warmth, sincerity and utter determination.  My guess as to why Anne acted so out of character at times is that she was struggling so very much through the war, and she was doing what she could to stay in control. Necessity obvioulsy outwheyed her pride at times, however one certainly has the sense of Anne's character growing through her turmoil. I loved the conclusion to the story, where we are brought back to the station where Anne met Mathew so many years ago. All things considered, I think that despite the storyline not matching the original Montgomery series, the film shows how any stories based around these brilliant characters can be a success.

It is depressing with such an out of character and time period soap opera storyline. It starts with a feminist conflict for Anne at a publishing house in New York, then drops that to move into the anti-war war plot. Anne the romantic goes to the battlefield chasing Gilbert, gets roped in as a spy (a naive, incompetent one, don't get caught drinking Anne-nun) and has some ""McGyver"" moments. Rooming with Fred and Jack's baby was the worst example of out of time period behavior. I could go into all the details but that's already been done.",1109203200,11,700,4.6

That book dealt with WWI also, although it was a completely different story.

I think it shows me that anyone could take Anne and Gilbert out of Avonlea and still weave an engaging story around them.

In my heart I wish that each of the books in the Anne series would have been made into it's own movie, but I will take what I can get.

They did a wonderful job capturing the innocence of Anne and her high spirits.  I loved it so much I had to read the books.  To my amazement I found the books very difficult to read.  The books said 6th grade reading level and I felt very proud to be able to finish them.  I have read and re-read the books (all 8 of them) again and again to help garner an understanding of life so long ago.  I still read the books to this day at the age of 27.  I love their innocence and I empathize with Anne's long journey into growing up.  What I liked the most was that the last 2 books of the series are written from her children's viewpoint.  We see WW1 rip into their lives in book 8.  Very tragic now that Anne is a mother of 7 children and some of them are marching off to war.  I hated the movie in that it jumped time so badly it completely cut out her marriage, the childhood of all her children, and the coming-of-age story of her youngest daughter.  Somehow they justified skipping 20 years for the 3rd movie.  I was so excited to find that Sullivan Pictures was going to put out a 3rd Anne film I automatically assumed it was going to cover ""Anne's House of Dreams"".

I have not read the books but I was disappointed.  You compare this to the first two and there's just not a lot of delight in watching it.

What I thought made Anne Shirley so wonderful to see was that she was this orphan who brought joy to everyone whose life she touched and yet I saw no joy coming from her interactions with other people.

I found her friend Diana's marital problems totally uncalled for.  I find it hard to believe that was in any books as L.M.M. seemed to write upbeat things.  I found Diana totally unsympathetic and the portrayal of her enemy Josie was just awful.  Josie was always stuck up but here she was portrayed as a self riteous shrew!  I didn't like to hate her in this story as in the past stories, I just wanted her to go away and for Anne and Gil to welcome her with open arms at their wedding?  Please...

Gil was Anne's love of her life so why was Gil absent for most of the movie and Anne's thrown into a relationship with a cad who's had a love child?  People have said that Anne and Gilbert had children why was it so important for Anne to adopt someone's love child and for her not to even be expecting a child in the end?

Anne in the previous movies seemed to have a knack for solving other people's problems and here she's just having problems thrown at her.  To put Anne Shirley Blythe in the middle of a war zone just seemed totally over the top and out of the realm of what Anne should be doing.

Someone said that there was a wedding night scene that was deleted in the American version however, I wish I could have seen it because with the way it all played out, I was wondering if Anne and Gil had even consummated their marriage before he left.

1)  Timing:  Anne's children fought in WWI, she would have been about 40 at this time.  Plus, she and Gil were long-married, not just newlyweds.

2)  Patriotism:  The filmmaker adds a sordid anachronistic ""anti-war"" theme which was absolutely not present in Anne's character, nor in her community.

3) Senitmental pap:  Anne was headstrong, but also a pragmatist.  She'd never have traipsed through the European battlefields searching for Gil -- nor put herself in compromising situations with friends.

4) The cry baby:  Throughout the last 3/4 of the movie, Anne lugs around a giant baby (at least 9 months old), which is accompanied by the soundtrack of a newborn infant wailing.  I'm serious -- this kid never stops crying.

Megan Follows really did not age well. Her voice sounds like she's a ""two-pack-a-day"" smoker. It really is sad. As for the actual story I can only say that it borders on the ridiculous and ludicrous and reeks with mediocrity. The World War I sequences are foolish and laughable. The several coincidences that occur throughout this story are beyond all credibility. Sequels like this often destroy the original. I hope this does not affect ""Anne of the Green Gables.""

We really were hoping to have a true continuation that followed the books and this was not it.
Once the war scenes started we had to send our five kids upstairs.  This movie is not for kids and definitely not an Anne movie.  Anne would never have acted the way this movie portrayed her.  They should have stayed with the books and then the movie would have been spot on.  The only scene that really reflected Anne how she would have been is when she first greeted Gilbert and fell flat on her face in the mud.
This movie was very anti-American and not particularly flattering to the British.  Though I did enjoy the scene during the enlistment of soldiers when they were being lead by a bagpiper.  That would seem accurate.

Where she would have acquired this new sense of ""worldliness"" I can't imagine (there's not a man in the whole movie whom she doesn't touch with more than sisterly affection; and the anti-war sentiment she displays is insulting to the Anne of the book series).  But if Kevin Sullivan thought that this would make her more appealing to today's audiences, he was sorely mistaken. What makes the Anne of Green Gables movies so appealing (and the books even more so), is the timeless beauty, mirth, and innocence that is so lacking from our own society.

1347551,1,B00004S8JT,"Heartbreaking!
I grew up reading the Anne books and watching the first two movies when they premiered on the Disney channel. I was hooked! I have had the first two movies (Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea) these many years and have loved them to near disintegration. I was delighted then to learn that some of my most treasured childhood friends had come back to the big screen in a new adventure.
Well, it certainly was new. Though the first two were not identical to the books, they were faithful to the spirit of the story and dialogue. Where this stilted, era-jumping mockery of L.M. Montgomery's story came from, I'll never know. I watched one time through, hoping it would get better. Many months later I decided to try it again and I turned it off after 10 minutes. I had to re-watch both of the previous movies to make myself feel better.
This movie took the cheesiest aspects of the characters, turned up the volume on them, and removed all of the wonder of P.E.I. so beautifully harnessed in the previous movies, plus took us to Europe and NYC?! Josie Pie morphs from a bratty gossip-monger to a militant war-monger, and Anne a near adulteress. These are not the characters I loved (and loved to hate).  The scenes showing the ruin that Green Gables had become were as heartbreaking as seeing my grandmother's house after Hurricane Hugo.
Perhaps this project was an attempt to make Anne a little more edgy, but unfortunately, the whole appeal of the previous movies and indeed of the books was that they were not edgy. They were sketches of ordinary life with extraordinary characters.
There was nothing extraordinary about this movie, except how extraordinarily disappointed I was.",1066867200,128,1700,4.762711864406779
1347552,3,B00004S8JT,"Having listened to Kevin Sullivan's commentary on the DVD versions of the first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" series, I was forced to conclude that despite the excellence of those productions he really has a very poor conception of L. M. Montgomery's stories. That certainly helps to explain the travesty of ""Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story."" As co-writer, Sullivan totally abandons Montgomery's Anne books to spin his own overly melodramatic tale of World War I, even though the author's ""Rilla of Ingleside"" deals with that same time frame. Of course, Anne is almost fifty years old by the time of that novel and it is a pair of her sons who go off to fight in the Great War. Montgomery's novel was published right after the end of World War I, making it a uniquely contemporaneous work which richly deserves a film treatment. Maybe Sullivan objected to the novel's politics, in which the characters supported the war and the Empire, unlike Anne in this film, but who knows. Clearly they waited too long to get around to making this third part, since Anne and Gilbert should have been married long ago. Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie are basically twice as old as the characters they first portrayed in the original ""Anne."" But while it is great to see these two playing Anne and Gilbert again and there is nothing to fault with either one of their performances, the story told here is just plain awful. There is no reason to tell the tale of a wife who goes looking for her husband in Europe using L. M. Montgomery's characters and if you want to do the struggling writer routine they could have turned to Montgomery's Emily books.
The first two ""Anne"" series were filled with warm and wonderful moments that you enjoy viewing again and again. The only moments that stand out in this sorry affair are when Anne finally finds Gilbert and when she goes back to the train station where Matthew first found Anne so many years ago to give us a sense of having come back to where we started. Of course, a lot of our disappointment comes from the heighten expectation of finally getting to see our beloved characters on screen again. I know I am not the only one who has read everything written by L. M. Montgomery after seeing the first ""Anne of Green Gables"" program, so I know I am not alone in being bitterly disappointed by this production. Even worse, the storyline here effectively kills ever returning to Montgomery's original stories, unless we are to suddenly believe Anne's kids end up being old enough to fight World War II. Watching this is just such a depressing experience that you have to go back and read again the best parts of Montgomery's novels or watch the first two series again. This is not something Anne's fans will ever treasure, even if they are compelled to check it out. When they see the ruined state of Green Gables, the aptness of the metaphor will be palatable.",1065052800,503,2903,4.6498054474708175

I felt as much as Anne fought for and loved ""Green Gables"" she never would have given it away, not only because she spent some wonderful years there with Marilla and Matthew, but because Gilbert bought it for her.

I much prefer it all as LM Montgomery wrote in the books and maybe being so familiar with the books was what spoiled the movie for me. I would have to say that the movie did not have a cohesive storyline, provided too many unanswered questions and unbelievable coincidences, and the character of Anne had sadly lost her magic and her spunk.

I was glad to see more of Anne and her life, and  I was prepared to see a story that didn't follow the books (this from reading the reviews).  I was just disappointed there wasn't more screen time for Anne and Gilbert together. I love watching these two actors portray their characters.  There is such chemistry between the two that they are enjoyable to watch.
The whole tone of the movie was somber.  The war storyline was the focus of the movie and could be called the ""second character"".  I would have liked to see the whole Anne-Gilbert wedding.  This was what I had hoped for in the two previous movies.  I think any Anne fan would want to see the whole wedding.
This movie didn't seem to have the same quality as the other two Anne movies.  It seemed like something was missing.  Of course I realize it has been quite a few years between the sequel and this movie and it would have been impossible to get all the actors back to portray their characters, but it seemed like something was missing.  Maybe it was because Marilla was not in this movie.  She definitely was a presence in the first two.  Of course, I would rather Marilla not be in the movie than to have someone else replace Colleen Dewhurst.  That would have been horrible. She set the standard for Marilla.

Anne and Gilbert never move to NY, Marilla was alive when they got married and they married at Green Gables in front of the tree Anne love so much.  Gilbert never went to the army but it was their sons who went.  But still the movie was good, it was such a moving moment when Anne found Gilbert and when the little boy Dominic and her meet again and in ran in her arms and it was a sad moment when Jack die.  Gilbert never bought Green Gables, they move right aways after their wedding to another place to raise their own family, they never adopt a son.  I thought it was odd that Anne who love Green Gables so much decided to leave it to Diana and her family make a fresh new start with Gilbert and Dominic somewhere else.  I found it sad that they didn't made a movie true to the book of Montgomery, it will be a good movie to watch but overall this movie was good and it could had make a good book too but like I said the movie is not what happen in reality in the books of the serie of Anne!",1054166400,,1184,3.9746835443037973
1347563,1,B00004S8JT,"When I heard this 3rd installment of the Anne of green gables series was coming out, i was so excited.  I fully expected the spirit of the first two movies to be carried on in the 3rd movie.  I was sorely disappointed.
Let me say that I did read the book series first.  The first movie, of course, was as excellent portrayal of the frist book.  Even though the 2nd movie was a departure in many ways from the storyline of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th books, the spirit and character of Anne and Gilbert were portrayed very well, and I enjoyed that story as much as the books.  However, not only did the 3rd movie not even take a shred of plotline from the books, but Anne and Gilbert, as portrayed by the Actors and the script, were no longer Anne and Gilbert to me, but two entirely different people.  In the books, Anne retains her imaginative spirit, even when her family experiences war and hardship.  Here she becomes someone else entirely.  As mentioned by others, the movie should have been set when Anne and GIlbert were married, and had children.  There were 3 books about her children, certainly enough for a good movie.
Don't bother watching this one.  Don't even rent it.  Just hope they might scrap this one and redo it right (or re read the books)",1053907200,4,1253,4.404347826086957

But being a devoted fan of the books, I don't particularly care for any of the movies, especially the last two, because of the way that the characters, events, and settings were distorted at the whim of the producers. Anne of Green Gables was OK, because it followed the basic story line, but I was dissapointed with Anne of Avonlea, which left out wonderful characters in the books, and threw in people who didn't even exist, as well as combing elements from books 2,3, and 4 in the series. The last film was especially dissapointing.  To begin with, the settings were all wrong. Anne and Gilbert NEVER lived in, or even visited, New York, or anywhere else in America, for that matter. In the books, the time of Gilbert and Anne's courtship was set in the 1880s -- a peaceful, prosperous time. The turmoil of WWI came much later, when Anne's youngest daughter, Rilla, was a teenager, and Anne's three sons go away to fight in the war. The wedding scene was a dissapointment -- I think they should have been already married at the time the film began , or at least at the beginning of the movie, when times were happier. We had been waiting to see it for so long that it should have been a very joyous moment, but instead it was rushed and clouded with sorrow. Also, the story should have shown Anne and Gilbert's own children (or at least one or two of them) instead of an adopted war orphan who didn't even exist in the books. I was horribly dissapointed in this film, and I'm glad L.M. Montgomery didn't live to see how her Anne of Green Gables series was so horribly rearranged.",1051574400,5,1763,4.475155279503106
1347565,3,B00004S8JT,"I heard that this movie completely slaughtered the true story of Anne and Gil in their new home in Glen St. Mary, and pretty much it's true.  This movie completely diverts from the storyline, completely skipping important characters and monumental events, like Marilla's death.  Instead of Anne and Gilbert getting happily married and having a family, they rush through a wedding in about fifteen minutes that almost all Anne fans have been anticipating in the past 7 hours or so of this series.  On top of that, some RANDOM kid shows up in their lives instead of the six amusing ones she has in the book.  Heheh, like all the other complaints about this movie, it just didn't go with the storyline all of us were expecting...
On a lighter note, the acting, cinematography, music, scenery, etc. etc. was spectacular...nothing less could be expected from an Anne movie :0) I was even moved to tears in some scenes (but then again, I cried in Disney's Tarzan) I have to admit that some tears were those of frustration when I so deeply disapproved of their short-lived wedding celebration.  And, I was a little amused by the fact that all the actors that returned looked MUCH too old...even if Gilbert is as good looking as ever :0P Not to mention that it's the completely WRONG TIME PERIOD! Anne's two SONS go to the war in the novels so obviously a little time-warp went on between Anne of Avonlea (aka Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel) and Anne the Continuing Story.
Overall, if you're not an avid Anne READER but you do enjoy the previous movies, this movie will not disappoint you.  However, if you read the Anne novels and loved Anne's House of Dreams onward....this movie would NOT be in your best interest.  Stick to the previous two...those definitely reflect L.M.

The whole thing is full of cliches. It feels like the story was written in desparation in about a night. I literallly cringed when images from the previous two movies were shown as Anne's recollections, i suppose to make us feel sentimental or something. Just one of the unsuccessful aspects of this ""film."" The film itself deserves zero stars. The one star is entirely for the sake of the cast members, who are not to blame for the abysmal results of this film, the ""plot"" is worthless.

1347570,1,B00004S8JT,"An ardent Anne fan since third grade, I've seen the first two movies (Anne of Green Gables, and Anne of Avonlea) and I continue to be surprised with the caliber of those two films. Anne of Green Gables remains overall faithful, and is a delightful film. Anne of Avonlea attempts to combine three of the books into one film, and although many character changes, stays true to the overall sentiment of the books. I was flipping channels one night however, and I saw that a new Anne  movie would be on, (The Continuing Story) which I had not seen. At the end of the movie, I thought that, I would be sick. Even other members of my family who have read the series, but really had little or no opinions about them, shared my sentiments. I was so outraged that I wished to see the author of this script, and ask them how they were hired, for they should have been fired upon the first draft. In this movie, there is nothing, that at all relates to any of the books. The characters zoom forward in time, placing Gilbert in the middle of war, when in the reality of the series, Gilbert was far too old to fight, and it was Anne's sons who went away. None of charming characters from Anne's later lives are present, and are replaced by idiotic characters, including the token ""Yankees"" Anne meets in her journey. The baby Anne adopts in the series is supposed to be a parallel to the baby her 17 year old daughter (yes...17 years old, and this is her YOUNGEST daughter) during the war, but in the series the baby is ultimately returned to it's father. This movie made me sick, and it will to anyone who cares anything at all about preserving one of the greatest works of fiction. On top of it all, it's simply what one would call a bad movie, plain and simple regardless of it's staying true to the series...it was baaaaaaad",1041724800,10,1815,4.385756676557864
1347571,4,B00004S8JT,"After watching the first two movies one after the other, then this last installment, it was an initial shock.  Made 10 years later than the other two, my first impression was ""They're so old!""  The movie starts in the lovely little Avonlea we are so familiar with.  The first half holds all the innocence, the town, the people we're used to.  Anne and Gil FINALLY are married...and all is good.  Then the war comes up, families are separated, Gil is MIA, and Anne goes to hunt him down.  This part of the story is an enormous departure from the books and is very different than the previous two movies.  The main theme still exists, though, that Anne is a strong, independent young woman who goes for what she wants, and that is the main message shining through.  After four hours of being wrapped up inside this story, the end is an absolute elation.
If you are an avid fan of the novels and would be upset to see the story portrayed anyway differently than what was written, I do not advise this movie.  You will be disappointed.  However, if you are open-minded and want to see another stages in these people's lives, the problems they face, and their relations with one another, I highly suggest this film.  It is an amazing story of sacrifice, fear, courage, and love.  It will leave you saying, ""Wow.  That was good.""",1037923200,2,1323,4.531645569620253

1347573,1,B00004S8JT,"An utter disgrace. This movie is an abysmal conclusion to the brilliant Anne saga. The warm and unfolding love story between Anne and Gil that kept viewers captivated during the first two movies, is abandoned in order to thoughtlessly pump out an Americanized, trashy, and nonsensical piece of soap opera, which bears no resemblance to the gentle and timeless Anne 1 and 2.
The wedding we had waited 10 years for was rushed and emotionless. Many scenes, including the wedding night fell victim to the cutting room floor. What remains of this movie is a betrayal not only to the characters, but to the scores of fans who have dared to dream about what was to be.
I could feel Megan's angst at portraying a character that was so terribly unfamiliar. Bitter, foul, unfaithful and totally lacking the graceful fortitude known to us, the new Anne goes about systematically destroying the image we all knew and loved. Gil? Non-existant. With the exception of a few token scenes at the start, he is not seen until the end of the movie. He is gaunt and bereft of the love and devotion that previously made all of us wish we were Anne.
Yes, this movie is a total departure from the original books. One could argue creative license. But what truly makes it a catostrophic failure is that there is no attempt at all to give the viewers -who have waited 10 years- what we so desperately wanted. Anne and Gil.
If this weren't meant to be an Anne of Green Gables movie, perhaps it would be classed as a feeble attempt at a war-time love story, overshadowed by an even more feeble spy story. In a word- GARBAGE.",1033689600,5,1596,4.564459930313589

My friends and I watched the movies in college over and over - I never expected them to make another, and wish they hadn't!  I happened to watch it on TV, and was crushed.  The second movie strayed slightly from the novels in order to condense the storyline, but the names and characters and ideas were all the same.  This third movie wasn't even close!  I don;t understand - a movie version of Anne's House of Dreams, or even Rilla of Ingleside would have been exciting and sweet, and much more scenic.  It also would  have solved the problem of replacing actors - there are so many new characters in those stories, and the aging of our favorite stars would have been more natural.  I was dismayed, until I happened to catch Anne of Avonlea on TV today - it reminded me of the Anne stories that i loved, and I am going to dig out my old books and read those stories again - hopefully purge myself of that awful #3!

I was SO excited at first but then as it seemed to be delayed for so long I became concerned that it was not going to live up to my expectations. It turned out to be even worse than I could possibly have imagined. I can't begin to say enough bad things about it; Anne drinking? Anne swearing? Anne flirting with adultery? Any one even remotely involved in the making of this travesty should be ashamed of themselves.

I'd probably give it four stars if the two main characters weren't named Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe. But then that's the crux of the situation--it didn't have anything whatsoever to do with the Anne of Green Gables book series.
It had most of the original cast from the 'Anne' films from the 80s (with the notable exception of Colleen Dewhurst, who died about six years ago), but honestly it had nothing to do with Anne of Green Gables. The only part of the movie that I recognized from the books was a mention near the end of Glen St. Mary. So for me, from the aspect of having been a huge fan of the Anne books and even of the first two movies for many years, this third installment was extremely disappointing. It did not portray the story you would expect from having read the books.
On the other hand, this was a pretty good movie, as I've said. It was an original screenplay that accurately depicted the horrors of WWI and even if I didn't already know Anne and Gilbert's history, I think it would still have been a kind of a sweet love story. If you were to take this film and judge it for the merits of it's story, acting, and cinematography, you'd probably find that it was a worthwhile investment of your time because it really is a good film from that perspective. If you were to take this film and judge it on the merits of how true it was to the books, you'd probably give it a negative ten stars and think that L.M. Montgomery must be rolling over in her grave. So let me finish up by saying this: If you liked the previous two 'Anne' movies and are just curious to see, you know, how the actors look today and what kind of performance they'll give, then by all means you should see this film. If you really liked the books and can't stand the idea of any director defiling L.M. Montgomery's vision in any way, shape, or form, then stay far, far away from this movie, for you are destined to be greatly disappointed.",1029974400,12,2044,4.311688311688312

It will only shatter every good memory you have of the others.
I understand that the reason the writers changed the story-line was the unfortunate absence of Colleen Dewhurst. Still they could have found ways around it. Instead, they've changed the story so ridiculously and drastically, that the beauty, strength, and grace of the characters (indeed the series) is lost.
The only good thing about this, is seeing Gilbert and Anne  married, and actually seeing how all the characters have physically grown and changed since we last saw them. (Most of the main actors are back, including Megan Follows, and Jonathan Crombie - who play Anne and Gilbert respectively.) To their credit, I must say that inspite of a very poor script, they still put on wonderful performances. Of course, there is only so far that good acting can carry a haphazard story-line.

I had in my heart a perfect mirror of Avonlea and all of Anne Shirley's doings.  Marilla and Rachel Lynde lived in Green Gables while Anne and Gilbert moved to Four Winds.  There was no war, no going to New York (which inflicted a horrible modernish streak to the setting of dear, old Avonlea).  To add events at the end of Montgomery's books I could tolerate, but to smash them in the middle does not fit.

Well, diverting 180 degrees from the source material (the anne of green gables series) doesn't help much. In the unforunate passing of Colleen Dewhurst (Marilla Cuthbert) the anchor of the previous two films, the producers decided to take the story into the own hands. While the premise of placing Anne and Gilbert in the midst of WWI had potential, the actual application of plots as grandiose as espinoage and intrigue leave a lot to be desired. The whole thrust of the story is haphazzard and sloppy with multiple scenes and characters very loosely tied together. It's as if the writers tried too cram to much in too little time. The stilted dialogue prevalent throughout the films entirety doesn't help the situation much either.
Perhaps the biggest criticism of this production is that it doesn't feel like an Anne of Green Gables story. The authenticity, charm and spiritedness that was so abundant in the previous two editions is no where to be found here. Instead, we are left with a story that obviously written from a cultural mentality that is decidedly modern as evidenced in the adulterous undertones in Anne's relationships with Fred Wright and Jack Garrison.
The performances by Megan Fellows (Anne Shirley/Blythe) and Jonathan Crombie (Gilbert Blythe) can hardly be faulted for the poor material that they are working with. One gets the sense that the actors inherently know the characters that they inhabit and are working hard to stay true to them despite the 180 degree turn of the sensibilites of the film series.

Anne and Gil's deep love for each other and mutual support of the other's achievements touched my heart. Their passion for each other has clearly amplified, and they FINALLY got married. I also found it refreshing that Gil placed compassion for his patients above personal ambition.
However, many other aspects of the film bothered me. For one thing, Anne is supposed to be in her twenties. I'm in MY twenties, and she looks far older than me (so does Gil). Another disturbing thing I noticed was uncharacteristic behavior from both of them. Granted, people do change (sometimes quite a bit). However, seeing Gilbert smoke and Anne drink seemed rather strange. And why is someone else playing Fred? Apparently Fred has changed a lot in his personality and looks. He doesn't even resemble the man I saw in the second movie!
Like many others who saw the film, I didn't like the ""spy element"" or the heavy-handed war theme. I had a difficult time processing everything I watched.
It also broke my heart to see Green Gables in ruins. I wonder what Marilla's reaction would have been if she'd lived to see how Mr. Harrison kept up the place. It would have been a no-nonsense approach, for sure. (Maybe a broom on his backside!)

But the rest of the movie... it's very beautiful in a way. Maybe if they concentrated more on the other parts instead of the war, people would like it even thought it didn't follow the books.
I never read much of the books, but I pashionately enjoyed the first two movies. I saw them when I was much younger, and the visual and artistic beauty is something that lives with me.
That's maybe what makes Anne 3 so painful. We expected her to be the same Anne that we saw when we were younger. Someone we could escape to. When our lifes have gotten harder and more painful as we have grown, we always wanted to see that Anne never changed.
But we have, and so has she. We can never go back to the world of the first two stories. It is gone. Anne admits that several times in the film. It is a great work of visual art in the end. They show Green Gables, they show the same scenery from the first two. But it is that sad end of a summer day feel. That it is over. We must move on.
I loved Anne 3 because it made me realize so many things about changing and accepting. I cried. I guess I could have done without the silly spy story. But the first and last parts of the movie are wonderful.
And we can still pop in the DVDs from the first two. They still exist. But I think Anne 3 is a truthful and beautiful (if someone stifled by silly whims of the writers) ending to the trilogy. It has never been the same Anne from the books... it is a different Anne. And I think this ending befits this Anne.",1016928000,,1679,4.075528700906345

I would have much rather seen Anne and Gil married with a head strong daughter of their own living at green gables then the way this movie goes While I am an Anne fan And will buy the film..

1347591,1,B00004S8JT,"Luckily I didn't buy this movie because I saw the miniseries on TV.  The main thing I didn't like about the second movie, Anne of Avonlea, was the how Sullivan Entertainment insisted on changing the story from what actually happened in the books.  I don't see why since the books were much more exciting then what they added in.  Anyway, this movie is not based on any of the books.  The only thing that comes from an L.M. Montgomery book is the characters' names.  I think Sullivan Entertainment just wanted to make a movie about WWI and figured Anne Shirley would be a good selling point.
One problem started in the original movie, Anne of Green Gables, which was that it was set several years after the books.  In the books Anne and Gilbert are married right after Gilbert finishes college, they never go anywhere near the United States, or leave the island for that matter, and their children are the ones that go off to fight in the war.
I'm very disappointed in Sullivan Entertainment for using the love people have for these books to con them into buying a worthless movie.
Honestly, even if you have never read the books I don't believe you would like this movie.  The characters don't even have the same type of personalities they had in the previous movies and the entire thing is very poorly done.",1013126400,14,1308,4.564102564102564

1347593,1,B00004S8JT,"I am a real fan of Anne of Green Gables and all of LMM's works, so like many others I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  I knew they departed from LMM's books, but I was shocked to find out how much.  The story is loosely based on the last book in the Anne series, ""Rilla of Ingleside"", about Anne's youngest daughter during the First World War.  Being the only North American woman's written account of the war, it is a very famous book, and although fiction, has historical value.  In the book Anne & Gibert are middle-aged and the book centers around their young adult children, but the movie has Anne searching for Gilbert on the battle lines!  Of course Anne has a flirtation along the way even though she and Gilbert are married.  What were LMM's descendants thinking when they allowed this movie to be made!?

The first two movies are splendid and are true to LMM's characters in ways that the third movie is not.  Although poetic license was used, especially in the 1st sequel, they went a bit further in this second sequel.  Anne didn't seem like Anne.  Gilbert and Diana were so thin they were almost unrecognizable.  How different was Megan Follows as Anne?  One of my friends commented to me that she had seen the movie and actually was under the impression that the actor who played Anne was not Megan Follows!!

I think the most unforgiveable thing to me is how they portrayed Anne & Gilbert's wedding, which was so beautiful in the book ""Anne's House of Dreams""!

My hope is that if Sullivan productions tackles such a project again that they present ""Anne's House of Dreams"", a wonderful story, and stick to the words that made LMM famous!  Hopefully it is possible to re-do Anne & Gilbert's wedding!",1011312000,152,1724,4.570032573289902

I have never read the books and I know I'm missing out, but the movies are so well done I just want to watch the character's act out their roles so beautifully. I wasn't really disappointed with this movie. I loved the fact that now I'm twenty years old and seeing the old character's again brought back so many wonderful memories. I thought it was good that Anne now went through more grown-up problems than before dealing with her love. The best part is seeing Gilbert Blythe again and the wonderful love that him and Anne shared. It will never live up to the originals, but I thought it was nice to see what happened 5-10 years later.

Of course, as in most cases, this movie did not equal or surpass the first two movies. The ending seemed a little too disappointing and disheartening; furthermore, the movie itself did not carry the same magic that ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" had, mainly because this one was not shot in Avonlea. It's basically a film about WWI that just happens to have Anne and Gilbert as the stars. We remember the ""Anne"" movies as magical films with gorgeous scenery and the beautiful Avonlea; this is a war story and therefore does not have the same enchantment. Of course, if you are an avid ""Anne"" fan like me, by all means watch this edition and enjoy seeing your favorite characters for the third time.",1009670400,18,885,4.716129032258064

Although I must admit I was a little disappointed this movie diverted from the books, I did enjoy watching it.  It would have been nice to have the story follow the books and pick up with Anne's married life with Gilbert in Avonlea.  Other than that, I thought this movie was done fairly true to the feel and tone of the orignal movies.  The music, sweeping views, and nostalgia were fairly well represented.

1347604,1,B00004S8JT,"What a waste.  The romantic and dreamy, humourous and impetuous Anne is gone, leaving behind a woman twice as old and unforgivably dull, along with her long-suffering love Gilbert - the both of them barely recognisable, as they have altered so much both in appearance and in nature, since the first two productions.
The feel of the Anne films, which were captured by the idealistic and diverse characters, the sweeping views and nostalgic settings, the musical score, the laughter and tears, in short the magic, is totally lacking in this third production.
Why didn't the creaters of this episode set the story in the context of L.M. Montgomery's 'Rilla of Ingleside', making Anne and Gil the parents of children who are caught up in the conflict of WWI?  This would have been infinately more believable considering Anne and Gilbert's respective age and appearance, and could have set out to capture the hopes and fears, loves and tragedies of the times. As is stands the story line is fantastical and devoid of interest.
It is ridiculous to ask viewers to believe that it has been a mere matter of a few years since Anne and Gilbert were betrothed.  Futher absurdity is found in the idea of Anne and Gilbert, still unmarried, going away together and getting jobs in New York. Then we are to beleive that Anne leaves Avonlea on an intrepid journey to find Gil in war-torn Europe.
Add to this Diana's transformation from a loving down-home family-and-friends woman to a affluent, materialistic, stuck-up tyrannical wife and mother.  Then add a Green Gables that has by some mystery in a brief space of years been allowed to decay into a complete ruin.
Dreadful.  I was so keen to see this film, as I'm an avid fan of both the Anne films and books.  Afterward, I wish I wouldn't have seen it at all.  What on earth were they thinking?",1002844800,63,1832,4.724137931034483

I was familiar with the story line only from having the videos, not from reading the books. I can't say that they were disappointing to me compared to the books because I had never read them, so I judged these movies on their movie merits not on how they compared to the books. This is how I judged the third movie, as a good, entertaining movie in and of itself. Others will tell you that this is a disappointing end to an otherwise great series, but I will not do that for that is not the way I felt. I enjoyed it very much.

1347606,3,B00004S8JT,"Having listened to Kevin Sullivan's commentary on the DVD versions of the first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" series, I realized that he has a very poor conception of L. M. Montgomery's stories. That would explain the travesty of ""Anne of Green Gables III."" As co-writer, Sullivan totally abandons Montgomery's work to spin his own melodramatic tale of World War I, even though the author's ""Rilla of Ingleside"" deals with that same time frame. Of course, Anne is almost fifty years old by the time of that novel and it is a pair of her sons who go off to fight and die in the war. Montgomery's novel was published right after the end of the Great War, making it a uniquely contemporaneous work which richly deserves a film treatment. Maybe Sullivan objected to the novel's politics, in which the characters supported the war and the Empire, unlike Anne in this film, but who knows. Clearly they waited too long to get around to making this third part, since Anne and Gilbert should have been married long ago. Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie are basically twice as old as the characters they first portrayed in the original ""Anne."" But while it is great to see these two playing Anne and Gilbert again, the story told here is just plain awful. There is no reason to tell the tale of a wife who goes looking for her husband in Europe using L. M. Montgomery's characters.
The first two ""Anne"" series were filled with warm and wonderful moments that you enjoy viewing again and again. The only moments that stand out in this sorry affair are when Anne finally finds Gilbert and when she goes back to the train station where Matthew first found Anne so many years ago to give us a sense of having come back to where we started. Of course, a lot of our disappointment comes from the heighten expectation of finally getting to see our beloved characters on screen again. I know I am not the only one who has read everything written by L. M. Montgomery after seeing the first ""Anne of Green Gables"" program, so I know I am not alone in being bitterly disappointed by this production. Even worse, the storyline here effectively kills ever returning to Montgomery's original stories, unless we are to suddenly believe Anne's kids end up being old enough to fight World War II. Watching this is just such a depressing experience that you have to go back and read again the best parts of Montgomery's novels or watch the first two series again. This is not something Anne's fans will ever treasure, even if they are compelled to check it out.",1001116800,13,2532,4.603982300884955
