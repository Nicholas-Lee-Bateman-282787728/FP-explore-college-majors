2840289,1,B000QUEPO6,"My son just loves trucks, anything and everything with trucks.  However, these dvds did not keep his attention at all.  I don't know if it was the format or what but there are other more interesting dvds out there on these same subjects.",1220918400,2,237,4.488372093023256
2840290,5,B000QUEPO6,"We own 4 of the Mighty Machines dvds and they have quickly become my 2 1/2 yr old son's favorite movies.  Beware that the theme song ""Mighty Machines"" will  get stuck in your head.  In truth, he's learned an awful lot about these types of machines, pointing out certain things I had no idea he knew!  (Which is even cooler, since my son has a speech delay.)  You can't beat the price for the length of the dvds, either.  They've been a lifesaver on long vacation trips this summer.",1218844800,,481,4.348314606741573
2840291,5,B000QUEPO6,my kids can watch them all day and never know why.......if there mom would let them,1214006400,3,83,4.25
2840292,5,B000QUEPO6,"This entire series is wonderful!  My son requests these DVDs more than any others we own.  They are about 90 minutes long, and explore the jobs of the machines- the trucks themselves do the explaining.  They are perfect for children 2-5, and provide hours of entertainment (and allow adults to get some things done in the process)!",1190592000,7,331,4.771929824561403
2840293,5,B000QUEPO6,"This is greatness- 180 minutes of GREAT, entertaining machines for less than $12.  My kiddos love this series- we're going to collect them all.
Good quality, educational, FUN.  A++",1189987200,4,180,5.172413793103448
2840314,5,B000QUEPO6,I bought these dvds when my son was 3. He's now 4 and still finds them facinating despite the fact that he's watched them over and over and over for the past year.,1256169600,,163,3.9696969696969697
2840315,5,B000QUEPO6,He is obsessed with trucks.  This DVD does the trick when we need him to settle down a little bit and just stay still.  We've owned this pack for a couple months now and I can see that the magic might be wearing off slightly.  But everytime I ask him what DVD he wants to watch it's always TRUCK!!!,1254787200,,298,4.016949152542373
2840316,2,B000QUEPO6,"I'd love to say these were fantastic since my sons are completely enthralled with trucks and tractors... unfortunately these are old footage, grainy and slow. It keeps their attention for a few minutes but just ends up running in the background. The voice over is dull and for some reason doesn't engage them. Really wanted cool truck footage but this is clearly old reel footage repackaged and just doesn't do it. One clip has been a hit... where they blow up an old mill. We just jump to that a lot. They're cheap for a reason.",1249948800,,529,4.520833333333333
2840317,4,B000QUEPO6,"This is a great gift for boys two years old and older! It has the perfect compliment of video, narration, and music. Our grandson loves it!!!",1242691200,,141,4.461538461538462
2840318,5,B000QUEPO6,Good prompt service.  Product just as described.  Will do business with this company again.,1239148800,,91,5.428571428571429
2840319,5,B000QUEPO6,"He's only 2-1/2, a little afraid of real sirens, but very interested. Lights & Ladders is just quiet enough so the WEE-OOO (firetruck) isn't frightening. He knows all the characters by name and can almost recite the dialogue word for word. The VROOM-VROOM-PEW (garbage truck) is another favorite.",1234483200,2,296,5.1875
2840320,5,B000QUEPO6,"These are nicely produced, with integrity towards children.oabout them. My 18 month old absolutely loves these dvds. He was into barney and the wiggeles but sinces I bought these he only asks for trucks! He can watch 100 times. Excellent dvds!",1231286400,,243,4.951219512195122
2840321,3,B000QUEPO6,"My son received several of these for Christmas this year: Tremendous Tools,  Big Wheels Rollin', Roadways to Runways, Diggers & Dozers, and Lights & Ladders.

While I have learned a lot about all sorts of vehicles, these videos are honestly kind of dull and slow-moving.

For example, in Lights and Ladders, we meet all sorts of city worker vehicles-- like street sweepers and trash trucks.  At once point, we spend several minutes watching the trash ooze from the back of the truck and it deposits it before it gets put into a landfill.  It is very dull-- in fact my son will spend about 15 minutes watching then run off.  Mind you, this is a 90 minute video!

I was hoping these were the ones that sneak letters, numbers and shapes into the program, like veggies in a casserole, but they are not.",1231200000,3,798,4.538461538461538
2840322,2,B000QUEPO6,Our two year old granddaughter was fascinated with the real thing when we saw some workmen putting in pipeline on one of our city's streets. I used to have video with heavy equipment machines at work. We had hoped these DVDs would be like our old video. Our granddaughter loses interest with these. Perhaps later she will have the patience to watch more. They could have used tighter editing or something.,1231200000,,405,4.71830985915493
2840323,5,B000QUEPO6,They're so simple compared to animated movies but yet so captivating!  Voices talk for the machines while they're working in their field.  They're lots of fun and I've never met a 2-5 year old boy who doesn't love them.  I've even learned a thing or two!,1230681600,,254,4.478260869565218
8197447,5,B000QUEPO6,Purchased as a gift.,1484179200,,20,4.25
8197448,5,B000QUEPO6,Perfect for our needs,1476576000,,21,4.5
8197449,4,B000QUEPO6,"I bought this DVD for my two grandsons (ages 3 and 4) and they love it.  They are into trucks, diggers, etc and this definitely keeps their attention.",1298332800,,150,4.357142857142857
8197450,4,B000QUEPO6,"These videos have a lot of repetition between the two but my three year old son loves them!  They each have 3 main videos and 4 shorter bonus clips.  The machines talk about what they do and explain everything that is going on at the construction site, garbage dump, fire house, demolition site, etc..  Perfect for preschool age kids that like trucks.",1288569600,,351,4.629032258064516
8197451,5,B000QUEPO6,I bought this for a gift for a friends son after my son has had much joy with it.  What a great buy and any little boy would love to watch trucks day and night.  You don't just watch trucks but you learn more about them as well.,1280620800,,228,3.7291666666666665
8197452,5,B000QUEPO6,"The DVDs were ordered for my small grandchildren who love to watch big trucks and bulldozers in action.  These videos are great, showing real people and real machines at work.",1279238400,,175,4.833333333333333
8197453,2,B000QUEPO6,"My son got this from his grandmother for his 4th birthday.  He loves dvds and has a good attention span for his age, but these DVDs don't quite capture it.  Honestly, I don't blame him...it's boring!  Maybe for a younger age...",1271548800,,227,4.487804878048781
8197454,2,B000QUEPO6,My 16 month old loves trucks so I was hopeful this would be a good dvd for him. He was mildly interested at first but it didn't last. There's not enough concentrated truck action or music but the trucks talk in the first person and have these really annoying character voices. I thought if I liked this one I might order more in the series but now I'm sorry I ordered this with the lights and ladders dvd. I rented a construction dvd that was shot in the 80s and is super dated but we both like that one better than this.,1269475200,,521,4.117647058823529
8197455,3,B000QUEPO6,"I do wonder if one day, I will forget the annoying theme song. Not likely in the future, since it is my son's favorite part of the video. In fact, he doesn't go too far beyond the theme song.

I do like these. I could do without the mindless banter and silly conversations between the machines. But these aren't for me.

My son, who just turned 3, picks these out every so often to watch. He very much enjoys the fire engine one. It does quite a bit of the behind the scenes, which includes things he doesn't get to see normally.

All in all, these are ok.",1268265600,,556,4.12962962962963
8197456,4,B000QUEPO6,"My son loves these series!  The theme tune is catchy and he loves to sing it, and the video footage is well shot and keeps him interested.  The only drawback is the voice over they do with the equipment, it is a bit cheesy and annoying to listen too, especially when your son watches it over and over and over....of course, apparently he doesn't seem to mind.",1265500800,,359,4.343283582089552
