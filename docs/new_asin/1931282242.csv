That is interesting, to put it nicely, considering the fact that the ladies who made this program are also from Birmingham, Alabama.  I cannot help but wonder if these people were asked to post positive comments about this product.  I am not making any accusations.  It is strictly my opinion.  In reference to the video program itself, I agree with the first person to rate this product and that is to ""please save your money.""  I truly wish this product could be recommended and I wish it were helpful, but unfortunately it is not.  The idea is good, but the results were not.  Please try to improve this product.  Thank you.",1128211200,6,693,4.614754098360656
7992391,5,1931282242,"I highly recommend this program for younger elementary age students to get a concrete foundation on social skills.  Honestly, most students with Asperger syndrome do much better if they can watch something over and over.  This video series has great topic selection related to real issues that someone with Asperger syndrome would face, and it is a great visual tool that the kids can watch, rather than something that is only for the teachers.",1124755200,,444,4.986486486486487

7992393,1,1931282242,"I was disappointed in this video series.  It shows the developers of the program introducing the segments.  Next, a group of children ackwardly, in most cases, say their lines. Then, one of the program developers comes back on the tape telling you to pause the tape and review the situation with your child.  Unfortunately, the program shows each child saying his/her lines often without a pause in between each child. There is one segment where the children sit around the table working on conversation starters.  Each child gets a chance to say his or her line.  I can only imagine a child or adult with Autism memorizing all the lines and using them all at once as conversation starters.  Ugh!  In addition, there is one girl on the videotape who speaks softly and it is difficult to understand what she is saying.  I have purchased many more suitable programs to help a child with an Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Unfortunately, this program will not be among them.  Please save your money.  The program had good intentions, but it did not show in the finished product.",1119052800,8,1070,4.760869565217392
