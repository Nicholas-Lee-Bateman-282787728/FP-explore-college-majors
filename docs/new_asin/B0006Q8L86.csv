There are basically only two different workouts, but also can make a great travel companion on the go, take it on your trip out of town.",1438041600,,243,4.191489361702128
8229717,5,B0006Q8L86,"I have both the power 90 & these, the power half hour tapes and although it is all good, I like these better. They are a no-frills way to get in shape. The power 90 tapes are a little boring after a while, but they do work  - especially the sweat & sculpt 3/4 advanced. The power half hour tapes consist of 5 tapes - the buns tape will make your buns burn even when you are more advaced because the people doing the workout are very advanced and you can tell they are working - it is all modifiable. That buns workout is the best, just personal preference. Abs is also really good - there is also legs & arms & a power stretch - all very good. I especially like Tony - he has a goofy personality & makes the workout fun  - not choreographed - when you have a goal, which I do, fancy, dancy choreographed moves don't give you results. I tried the firm & it was just like that - just when your heartrate got to a good steady point, they would stop & do something standstill, plus they moved didn't activate muscles consistenly in the cardio section, it was just tooooo dancy. The best part about p 1/2 hr. is it's only 1/2 an hour. The program also has alternative moves so anyone can do them and I am seeing results after doing them for about a month (along with other tapes - I bore way too easily). I have been exercising consistently for about 1 1/2 months and I am in ok shape - not falling apart or anything, but do have some weight to lose and since muscle burns fat, this is helping - 1 dress size already. The only thing that is a bit bothersome about the tapes is that there isn't much time (like 2 seconds) between the floor & standing exercises, so unless you pause for a moment, you inevitably lose a few reps somewhere along the way, but it is timed to be exactly 30 minutes (minus quick cooldown, so it packs as much as it can in the 1/2 hour. You don't rest in between like you do with power 90.",1108857600,37,1909,4.101604278074866
