7912334,2,B00000JKZL,I bought this in anticipation of my 2017 Grand Canyon rafting trip.  I thought it was rather boring.  I have since bought Wallace Stegner's book Beyond the Hundredth Meridian which I think does a more interesting job of telling the story.,1478563200,,238,4.780487804878049
7912335,5,B00000JKZL,"I have been interested in this historical event ever since seeing the Walt Disney movie ""Ten Who Dared"". This wonderful PBS program provides much more information on this daring expedition of the first men to travel the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Even though this was on VHS, it is also available on DVD. If you are interested in true life historical events, add this one to your list.",1415750400,,399,4.714285714285714
