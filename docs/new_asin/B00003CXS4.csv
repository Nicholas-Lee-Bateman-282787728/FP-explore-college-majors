1288505,4,B00003CXS4,guy ritchie is very talented and can make a quick pound on the multiplex market but the aim of this game after breaking the ice is to leave us with something that can linger. and riggle into a classic spot. sure for the moment he is setting the pace but if this is the pace then the film industry is going to speed up hollywood already churns out more crap then a elephant with diahorrea.  we all saw the explosion that almost devoured tarrantino crime thrillers with strange subplots conversation and sickly humour almost killing the market. this month alone i have seen four ritchie inspired gore fests involving a lot of old british television and film actors dressed in italian suits and using excessive violence and unfunny dialogue the worst being gangster no 1 and i don't think that there can be a second best the other ray winstone filled thrillers hold no weight. this is a great movie if only ritchie exposed this to the world first it appears as though he has just altered the major points and characters in the script and the fact that he has used the cast from lock stock just to show his love of familiar faces too woo the audience just represents the shadow that the first film has cast. guy has been whirled into a world of bright lights and movie premieres but the best work produced in the majority of art be it film paint or the even the written word is when you try to break new ground and try other directions. financially a sucess it keeps the young men happy but if ritchie wants the mountain he cant use a plane he has got to use the pathway.,978220800,,1567,4.384879725085911
1288506,5,B00003CXS4,"I had some time to spare while I was in Amsterdam, back in November 2000. I went in doubting I would like this Film, since I did not care much for Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock..."" To my astonishment, I loved it. I would go as far to say it was the best Film I saw in 2000. The acting was superb, the cinematography was brilliant, and the story was fast paced and fun. Brad Pitt along with the rest of the ensemble cast hit their marks perfectly, from the moment the Film starts till the second it ends you will not see a more entertaining Film this year. I don't want to give away any plot points, but trust me this Film is worth $.... I only wish we had more American Films of this caliber.",977443200,5,688,4.0661764705882355
1288507,5,B00003CXS4,"'Snatch' is comparable to 'Unbreakable'.  Not in the sense of storyline or content, but negativity. If you walk in to see 'Snatch' expecting another 'Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', you will be dissapointed, just as those hoping for another 'Sixth Sense' were.
'Snatch' is primarily the story of Turkish & Tommy, two illegal boxing promoters who get caught up in the world of underworld figure Brick Top, when their bare knuckle boxer Gorgeous George is incapacitated by One-Punch Mickey (Brad Pitt in his best role to date), over a caravan. Now short of a boxer, and seriously in debt to Brick Top, the boys arrange to have Mickey take his place, but Mickey is not going to throw a fight the way they all had planned, which leads to more trouble for the boys.
It also features a bunch of pawn shop owners attempting to 'Snatch' a diamond stolen by Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio DelToro).  Unfortunately, the diamond is also wanted by Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina), Doug The Head, Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie 'The Man' Jones) and Boris The Blade.
To those naysayers out there, let me tell you this, don't expect a sequel to 'Lock Stock' and you will love this film. Full of great camera action, absolutely brilliant performances all around, a clever, very funny script, add Brad Pitt's unintelligible Mickey, and you have a cracker-jack of a film experience.
By the way, the final sequence at another boxing match is one of the most brilliant scenes you will ever witness on screen. One reviewer described it as ""'Raging Bull' meets 'The Matrix'"". This doesn't even begin to cover it, trust me.
See 'Snatch' the second it opens, and then pre-order the DVD the second you get home.",976579200,,1678,4.762886597938144
1288508,5,B00003CXS4,"I absolutely loved this movie, there are no two ways around it, this is a classic.  Brad Pitt was excellent, believable, likeable, funny, and a well-developed character (something which is missing in many movies these days).  The numerous plots, each with its own twists and turns, meet in many places for some amazing action and dialogue.  I personally think that it was much better than LS&TSB, because it held your attention with some great action scenes to keep the plot moving (not too many shoot-em-up scenes too!).  Overall, Snatch is a breath of fresh air from the crap served up to us by Hollywood recently. Long Live British Film (and aussie too!!).",976320000,14,659,4.857142857142857
1288509,5,B00003CXS4,"If you liked ""LockStok"" and ""Fight Club"", This is it. Sarcasm, violence, fun, confusion, comedy all rolled up in to one dark atmosphere. It's just great, light, and you go out smiling.
Brad Pitt, great actor, no matter where you put him, he's just Believable, (if you got a good memory - he's like Harison Ford, in the early days - Indiana Jones or Star Wars) Great future!.
""Snatch"" is great I give it full five stars, with a happy gun smoking grin. Go see it on Theaters and then get the Dvd, and see it at home!.",974419200,,515,4.26530612244898
1288510,5,B00003CXS4,"Same sharp, dark humour of lockstock. Brad Pit is fantastic, Vinny Jones plays the usual hard man. From illegal boxing matches to extorting caravans, the movie has more twists and plot swings than you can keep up with in one sitting - highly reccomend this to everyone.",974419200,3,269,4.74468085106383
1288511,4,B00003CXS4,"One of the few movies that opened earlier in Europe than the USA, and i've read you still have to wait for 2 months to see it in the cinema, so i'll try to give you my opinion without spoiling too much. If you liked Guy Ritchie's last flick, ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", you're gonna love this one. The setting is a bit darker at times than LockStock, but the same sarcasm, the same London slang, the same types (even some of the same actors as LockStock, most notably Vinnie Jones), it's all there.
Only thing i have to get off my mind, is that i didn't really like Brad Pitt in this movie. Not that he was bad, but knowing he's an American actor, trying to portrait an Brittish camper with matching slang... it clashed somewhere. But that's just nitpicking, you might love him, you might hate him. But apart from that, Guy's fans are gonna love this. I know i did.",974246400,4,875,4.3090909090909095

I had not heard of it at the time, although I was familiar with Lock, Stock, etc.  Snatch did not disappoint.  I laughed so hard at times that I was crying.  The cast is remarkably optimal for the film - I can't imagine assembling a better group to highlight the various characters - and the film has its share of 'characters'.. I don't think you can call Snatch  'slapstick', although some of the scenes come close.  'Dark comedy'?  Maybe, but it is so much more than that.  This is a must see for yourself.  I am sure there are some who will watch it, and not make it all the way through.  But, if you like British wit in cinema, this is well worth watching.

This is a movie you don't have to make 8 to appeal to teens. As a note I like some of the fast and furious..I just think this movie is cooler..Lennie James before The Walking Dead..playing a fumbling pawn shop and low level crook..is a plus..He got to say the best line ""Don't Snatch"".. The show motion fight sequence  is amazing footage. Worth any gallery art show. Glad he got to play around with that a little more in Sherlock Holmes .On my movie wish list with Guy Richie I would love to see a Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as an add on one of his casts.

Guy Ritchie is exceptional on pointing out human errors, and compounding a hilarious story off of goofy seemingly-random events.

1291793,5,B00003CXS4,"Saw this one in the theaters, I've seen it about 10 times since. This one belongs on your movie bucket list.

It's particularly unusual because there's a huge array of different characters, yet they're all quite distinct in a way that you have zero problems remembering who is who and what they're after. They have a feeling like they're real. Since it is the mileau where Guy Ritchie, the creator, lived in, it seems likely that it's an at least partly true story.

The second film from Guy Ritchie. Watch this one along with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and the two Sherlock Holmes films, of his works. If you have not seen  Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I do recommend watching that first. You don't have to, but I think they work best that way.",1437868800,2,764,4.521739130434782

1293423,5,B00003CXS4,"Quick cuts, multiple plots, and memorable characters.  This movie never rests.  The main plot centers on a diamond ""the size of your fist"" which is stolen.  The path the diamond takes through the movie follows the myriad characters through their own tribulations.  Brad Pitt plays a supporting role as a gypsy ""piker"" fighter who has his own plans.  Jason Stratham plays the main character, a boxing promoter in debt to a psychopathic mobster.  Never a good idea.  The movie moves around seamlessly between the many stories, never spending too much or too little time on any of them.  It is a fast paced film which doesn't linger too long on any one subject.  It is not a movie like ""Crash"", which strained to weave the stories together.  This movie instead allows the stories to melt together more organically.  It has some serious moments, but they are tempered with comedy.  It is violent, but the worst of it is off camera and not in your face.  No nudity or sexual situations to speak of.  Appropriate for kids 14 and up.  Recommended if you are looking for a fast paced movie that will kill a couple hours on a rainy night.",1429833600,,1129,4.603015075376884

All performers gave excellent representations of their character, and all of the settings were an integral part of the feature overall. While I say that the ""meat"" of the story was a little foggy, yet the story and portrayals carried the story-line along well. So I can recommend this one for the character acting portrayals, the action, the sets, and the story-line. It was not boring and kept me watching throughout.

I'd have to say the plot was a bit thin; it won't draw you in like 'The Usual Suspects'. It's more what you'd expect if you were watching videos of world most bumbling burglars.
The most noticeable down side of it was that the trio of black thieves and their scheme were almost too clueless to fit with the rest of the flick; had I been black I would have felt properly insulted at the shallow scripting they black actors had to play out, and would've said to myself 'that's what I expect of a white guy'.
What worked best or me was the fast pace and how the scenes were sequenced and how unpredictable it was, Brad Pitt's excellent Irish Gypsy accent (I wouldn't know if it wasn't excellent, but he sure made me believe it) and that I laughed even when people got killed.",1427760000,,929,4.224719101123595

1295339,5,B00003CXS4,"This story is essentially a cast of eclectic and eccentric characters straddling the line into caricatures, all crossing paths with each other and reacting to each other more or less authentically. The cast is a combination of new, established, or veteran actors who inhabit their characters honestly and unabashedly. At the core of it is a very large diamond, the attempts to obtain it motivating a number of the characters, who in turn, bounce off other characters starting off slightly convoluted chains of events that intertwine with each other. A bit like a pin-ball game where the bumpers and paddles get bounced around the game as well as the ball.

You'll always want to know how something is going to turn out. You'll catch yourself slightly nervous at times, wondering ""how are they going to get out of this mess""? The is narration is superbly done by it's lead star Jason Statham (don't think it will work, well after watching this you'll see it works very well). Don't watch it in anticipation of a Jason Statham fight scene. This movie is much more compelling, and Jason Statham's character is not the one of the BA. He's no coward, as he keeps his calm in all situations. Snatch has many mini-stories going on that eventually all lead together. It's not confusing at all, every story has so much interest that you find yourself always wondering what's going to happen. In a nut shell IMHO Brad Pitt steals the show, he plays a part he was born to play. Great Movie!!",1426118400,,948,4.517441860465116

Best line in the film: Turkish and Tommy regarding the pos trailer they have; TOMMY ""What's wrong with this one?"" TURKISH ""Oh, nothing, Tommy. It's Tip Top. It's just I'm not sure about the color."" as he's pulling the door off the hinges. He says the line completely straight faced. And it's hilarious. The whole movie is like that. The editing and timing of the movie is perfect. I did have a little trouble with the accents, but I was able to rewind and watch again.

If you have a problem with F-bombs, maybe not your movie. 163 times. But gory violence? All the killings take place off screen.

Overall, a great film that might take a view viewings to get. But right now, it's free on Prime so have a nut!",1425686400,,1026,4.366492146596858

He wears this unique character like a custom-fitted shirt.  The other main characters are most impressive at the same time.  It's just not as big of a stretch for fabulous Farina and del Torro.  Alan Ford, the British super-bad guy is terrific along with an assortment of memorable characters.  There is no lack of entertainment, action, laugh out-loud humor and violence. Admittedly, probably more a guy's flick - but, damn it's good.  I always thought this movie and actors deserved a lot more praise than it got.  Great for any guy's library.

1298505,4,B00003CXS4,"This is a really good movie, and there are things about it that are (kind of) brilliant. It emulates Tarantino and ""Pulp Fiction,"" but that influence is so buried that it isn't bad enough to drag this movie down. There is more than enough to this movie that is original. The editing and action are more fast paced than ""Pulp Fiction,"" making it more adrenaline pumping, but probably less artsy, and not as good of a movie. This may be Brad Pitt's best role ever, in which you can't really see a lack of confidence. There are many clever jokes and situations, and the movie plays well. The only thing to really drag the movie down is that it is too violent and obscene, but the rest of the movie is really good. I take off a star for its overly violent nature. Also, the story aside from the violence isn't quite a masterpiece, as good as it is. Still a very very good movie.",1414972800,,874,4.303030303030303

Plus sometimes, because of their British accents, it's hard to understand what they are saying, especially the gypsies (Brad Pitt, et al). I'm also a Jason Statham fan, and this was his second movie, I think Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was his first, although this movie doesn't portray him as the character he's became.
It's just a very entertaining movie, if you like comedy / action flicks, and there is seldom a pause in the action or the humor, although, sometimes the humor is a bit dark.",1412899200,5,646,4.483050847457627

Indeed, the characters are the big plus, for the plot -- while it has its moments -- is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. In fact, the climax of the picture is, in terms of storytelling, not inventive at all. Still, those character portrayals are marvelous, the dialogue snappy and witty, and the editing first-rate.

1299841,3,B00003CXS4,"Snatch is close to a carbon copy of Guy Ritchies' earlier movie Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. It has the same frenetic, engaging style and leaves many of us trying to figure out who's teamed up with whom and why should any of us care? A bunch of low lives battle over who gets the big, stolen diamond and most of the main figures don't seem to make it to the end of the film, them being dead and everything. How they got this far in life without being eliminated so much earlier is not sufficiently explained. The film definitely has a comic flair and will delight any film goer who loved the scene in Pulp Fiction where the person in the back seat got their head vaporized by accident (if I remember correctly) by a guy in the front seat. What a laugh riot that was for the teenagers in front of me at the time. If they haven't sufficiently matured, they'd love many of the scenes here.

Luckily I took advantage of the subtitles so I could decipher much of the dialogue, particularly Brad Pitt's. (Pitt has the best role in the show, someone who is positively moral compared to the rest of the human dregs, though incomprehensible. Not in his aims; it's just that no one in the film or the audience can understand this Irish gypsy's garbled gibberish. But somehow the subtitles lady/guy did.) The unfortunate side effect of this gift from the filmakers was that I read most of the movie and was always a half second behind the actual action -- not because I'm a slow reader; it's just that the titles were a wee bit tardy. The director's strategy seems aimed at the attention deficit crowd. There's never more than a few minutes before someone is getting knocked out, crammed into a car boot, having his dead arm chopped off, running their car into a light pole, or shown spread-eagled in mid-air in ultra slow motion, hair and sweat flying, after being nuked in a boxing match (only to come back and knock out the bad guy. Natch!)

I have no argument with the acting. Overall, it was scary and appropriate. It's fun to laugh at really stupid people doing stupid things, but every one of those people here can back up their idiocy with firepower. Luckily -- hopefully? -- they don't inhabit your real world. Pitt's performance made me smile throughout. It's apparent he was having a good time with his role. But midway (or earlier), I was wondering who I was supposed to care about or identify with or even want to watch for very long. If your idea of a good time is to watch a morbidly obese getaway guy getting stuck trying to get out of his own car -- get the irony there? -- you'll like this movie. (I did like that clip.) If you're into clowns with huge guns mowing down other knuckle-draggers, you'll like this movie. (For me, that grew really tiresome.) In summary, it's a comic book of a movie. Colorful (but not in its camera work -- the film is set primarily in dingy locales -- fast-paced, perversely funny, derivative, memorable for certain scenes/characters, but ultimately a ""Meh.""",1374105600,,3005,4.511926605504587
1299942,5,B00003CXS4,"I was very skeptical about seeing this movie, especially since Benicio Del Toro gets top billing on the Amazon website (he is not a favorite). However, he plays a minor, and quite funny role, so bonus. What people need to know is that the movie, though raw and brutal in places, is outstanding. It is funny, dramatic, and offers several tongue-in-cheek segments that add to the overall greatness of the movie. Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Andy Beckwith, Vinnie Jones, Rade Serbedzija, Lennie Jones, and Alan Ford (as the pure evil Bricktop) are each excellent in their roles. I recommend this movie to everyone I know (adults only of course).

Brad Pitt's performance was incredible and unintelligible (I Mean That As A Compliment). I had to use the subtitle option whenever he was speaking as I could barely understand any of the words he anunciated. While the film shares a similar theme with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it has a bigger budget and a faster pace than the aforementioned film. Too, its ensemble cast really compliment one another and the movie itself.

I won't go overly into detail on the film suffice it to say that I enjoyed it and will say that anyone who liked Pulp Fiction or 2 Days In the Valley or Get Shorty will love this film.

It is also fun to see Stathem before he was such a big action star. He is a little more subdued, and relies on his acting more than muscles. Definitely a must own.",1356220800,,440,4.313253012048193

I actually rented this on Netflix and tried to watch it at least 3 times before finally giving in and just putting up with the speech in it.  I understood only about 40% of what was being said. The accents are horrible and I could understand nothing Brad Pitt said. The plot was confusing enough but when you add in the fact that you can't understand the dialog, it makes you want to give up on the movie.

The cast does a great job, I especially liked Brad Pitt as Mickey; his accent is very funny and has plenty of memorable lines like the ""D'ya like dags""/""Do you like dogs"" bit. I also liked how the film interlinked all of the characters so well. Plenty of memorable/bizarre characters, a very fast pace, great storytelling, and a great blend of action and comedy contribute to this film's greatness.

I highly recommend Snatch. I definitely had a great time watching this film. As of 8/7/12, Snatch is available on Netflix Streaming

1300344,5,B00003CXS4,"Of all the film genres, action and action comedies are where films by foreign directors have reached the quality of films by US directors.  It used to be that the best action movies and action comedies had names like Lucas, Spielberg, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola attached to it.  No more.  Now the top action and action-comedies are often made by Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo del Toro, Peter Jackson and other non-US directors.  This is probably most epitomized in the field of crime-action-comedy.  American films of this class has degenerated into rehashes of franchises such as Die Hard, Terminator, and Bad Boys, with over-the-top special effects, forgettable soundtracks, and bad dialogue.  England, on the other hand, is producing 1 or 2 great urban crime comedies annually.  It all started with this production from the pairing of Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn, Snatch.  Taking a look at the criminal underworld of the UK, we see splices from the world of gambling, money laundering, illegal fights, pawnshops, and the black market trade in jewels.  The movie populates this world with a collection of characters of varying dryness and sarcasm, all trying to outwit the other while staying alive.  Yes there are gunfights, but they are few and far between, and like real gunfights, and unlike those featured in US-made movies; almost everyone gets hit.  What carries the movie is the dialogue, and seeing how the different characters talk down, or up, or to each other; profanity or no profanity.  This ranges from Brad Pitt's take of a Irish vagrant to a Jason Statham's personification of an exasperated middleman caught between a rock and a hard place.  All of it is well-crafted and speaks to the script-writing underlying this movie.  Overall, well worth the watch.",1341187200,2,1832,5.104026845637584

And then there are the REALLY rough parts that are hard to get through.  I love the gypsy dog that swallows the squeaky toy (and then squeaks when he barks) along with everything else in sight, the Russian mafia guy they just can't kill, the huge getaway driver who can't fit through the car door nor back into a large parallel parking spot... but I could do without the violent robbery, mass murder, attack dogs, and foul language.

these few things should throw-up the red flag: it has Brad ""the arm"" Pitt in it along with Jason Statham. basically with Brad you're getting a Scottish accent that's so thick you have to strain to understand a word he says in this movie so that totally nullifies the point of him even being in the movie because other than boxing and talking Scott he doesn't have a part in the movie. all Jason does is use the F-Bomb word almost literally every other word throughout this whole pathetic excuse. and it was directed by Guy Ritchie, so this isn't actually considered a legitimate movie.

If you say ""F-Bomb"" every other word, everyday, all the time and it uses up 99% of your vocabulary, including using it in job interviews this one is for you.

I would recommend this movie if you enjoyed trash like the hangover.",1319414400,3,1434,4.44106463878327

The ending (while to some) might be a surprise, over all there isn't a lot of true surprises. With that said, this movie has action, humor and a few twists and turns. If you don't like Guy Ritchie movies, you probably will not like this. Not a traditional action film, it has its moments. While not as strong as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it still has a place in the ""should see"" movie lists. Brad Pitt is surprising good in his roll. He proves that he isn't just a ""movie star"" but has acting ability as well. Jason Statham is his usual self (which depending on your view of him can be a very good thing) and Vinnie Jones quietly steals the show as he always seems to!",1317772800,,784,4.304054054054054

1300634,5,B00003CXS4,"I have a bit of a thing for British comedies.  I enjoy various British accents and I have come to learn much of their slang, as well as to get used to their unique brand of humor.  Consequently, I loved this film Snatch.

I watched Snatch before Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, so I was unaware that Guy Ritchie basically just lazily reused the same concept from that prior film and threw in a couple of variables to make it seem different.  Now that I know, I can't say I honestly care.  Both films are good in their own right, but I think I prefer Snatch.  The ""formula"" of profane, heavily accented British thugs bantering with each other, and multiple plot-lines criss-crossing into total mayhem at the film's climax, is one that I have no problem seeing twice.

Snatch is a very clever movie.  Guy Ritchie came up with some great ideas on how to make the seemingly separate stories work together in perfect harmony, and managed to kill off nearly all the characters in one way or another, without making the viewer feel too sad about the losses.  The story, despite being rather absurd, is still fairly plausible, considering the ruthlessness of those involved.  Meanwhile, there is some side-splitting humor to be found, considerably more-so than in Lock, Stock... which focused more on dark, subtle comments.  My favorite part is the introduction to Tyrone, the ""getaway driver,"" as he attempts to squeeze himself into a Rover SD1 that is too small for him and then, after Sol and Vinnie discuss the merits of a SPAS-12 shotgun, backs into a van because ""I didn't see it there.""  I crack up laughing every time I watch that scene.

I also appreciated the film-making at work in Snatch.  The dark, gritty, overprocessed look really suits the dingy back alley settings of an overcast, seedy part of London and the insides of boxing rings.  The various slow-motion and unique angle shots contribute greatly to the feel of the film; the slow-motion shot of Brad Pitt/Mickey seeming to go down for good while boxing, and the waist-level upward shots of Brick Top's henchmen walking down the dimly lit, flickering halls really added a lot, in my opinion.  The soundtrack, as well, is amusing, fitting, and well-timed.  One of my favorite musical parts is the use of Mirwais' ""Disco Science"" as Tyrone and the hare are simultaneously being run down by gangster thugs and gypsy hunting dogs, respectively.

Overall, Snatch is a great movie, but don't expect to catch it all the first time unless you are really good at reading subtitles and seeing little visual details.  It's a movie that will benefit from several viewings, until you can catch all the vagaries of British slang and mumbling.  Whether or not Guy Ritchie blatantly recycled his ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" formula to make this film doesn't matter (and he definitely DID), because it is a gem in its own right (no pun intended....)

Enjoy it!",1282176000,2,2924,4.773359840954274

The movie's still great, and all the special features are there, but you can get everything in the ""regular"" release of the movie. Content-wise, there's no real reason to pick up this edition. The Deluxe Edition comes with poker cards, a dealer chip, and a ""scrapbook"". First off, poker wasn't even a big theme in the movie, so the entire inclusion of these elements is a bit iffy. I only picked up this edition because I just so happened to be looking for a deck of playing cards at the time, and figured hey, why not some awesome theme cards? I had no idea what a bad idea that would turn out to be.

The poker cards have a nice design, using characters from the films for special cards. The problem is, the cards are completely low-rent and unfinished. They stick together, they don't shuffle well, and the edges don't hold up. There were actually a few bits of paper falling off the cards' edges from the dodgy cutting. The dealer chip is just a piece of low-rent plastic, not an actual poker chip, and the word ""dealer"" was already a little rubbed off from the packaging. The scrapbook is just the sort of useless filmographies and biographies that have become infamous in attempts to fill up special editions, and is easily forgotten.

After seeing the extra elements, I just trashed them and kept the DVDs. Don't waste your money. If you're going to get this movie, pick one of the regular editions and just get the movie.",1274140800,4,1643,4.488294314381271

There are many funny lines that will stay with you a long time after watching this. Brad Pitt does a fabulous job as a gypsy bare knuckle boxing champ with an inscrutable accent. Dennis Farina is great as the only American character in the film. The rest of the cast is what makes the film tick Jason Straham as Turkish the narrator and small time hood is the glue that holds the whole thing together.

1300736,5,B00003CXS4,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""BLU RAY"" VERSION ***

Watching ""Snatch"" again - but this time on BLU RAY - I'm left reeling - I really am. It's clever, it's ballsy and it's just so ludicrously entertaining. But most of all - it's easily the funniest film I've seen in years. I mean when you're not laughing out loud (for all the wrong reasons of course), you're sat there giggling like a fool most of the time.

Writing wise too - ""Snatch"" is kicking like a mule, it's confident and beautifully constructed. It feels like a sort of updated modern-day Ealing Comedy - so good and so irresistibly English. I'm reminded a lot of the 1969 original of ""The Italian Job"" - another gem on BLU RAY (see review) that works its way into your heart and stays there. This is seriously impressive stuff - and especially as it was only Guy Ritchie's second movie.

But the really great news for fans and newcomers alike is the PRINT; it's RESTORED - and for about 95% of the time it looks immaculate in every frame. Very occasionally there's some blurring, maybe a few lines, but that's just the rough and tumble way it was filmed I suspect - and those shots as I say are very, very few indeed. Most of the time, it's looks fantastic and the clean up also seems to have brought the film so much more to life...it's a real pleasure to watch.

The extras are there too, which is great - and it's very reasonably priced.

You also forget about the sheer size and quality of the cast - Benicio Del Toro as the mumbling gambler Frankie Four-Fingers - Alan Ford as the fantastically crass and violent Brick Top - Rade Shelbedgia as the unkillable Russian Boris The Blade - Vinnie Jones as the man hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony - Dennis Farina as the Jewish American Diamond broker Avi, Mike Reid as his English equivalent Doug The Head - the gormless trio of Post Office robbers, Lennie James, Robbie Gee and Ade - Stephen Graham as the hapless sidekick Tommy who thinks too much about dairy products and what they do to the digestive system - and of course, the movie's trump cards - the pairing of Jason Stratham as Turkish and Brad Pitt as Mickey the bare-knuckle Irish boxing champion. Great stuff. Throw in hip music, choppy editing, apt locations and a dictionary of slang to work out what everyone is saying - and it's as chipper as a bulldog who's just swallowed a squeaky toy...

Having recently seen ""Sherlock Holmes"" at the cinema (and been seriously impressed too), I can feel the need for a Guy Ritchie spending purge coming on...

""Snatch"" on BLU RAY is brilliant fun - a winner to look at - and reasonably priced too.

Way to go guys.  Recommended - big time.

1300796,5,B00003CXS4,"By this point, I've seen all five feature films written/directed by Guy Ritchie, and his first two still remain my favorites and I believe, his best. Ritchie's debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was a refreshing, lean, original, and very funny British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. ""Lock, Stock.."" also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. Ritchie's next movie, Snatch, was my introduction to his work. It is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond as huge as these historic celebrated stones you might have seen on display in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom in London Tower or Washington Museum of Natural History or in The State Diamond Fund of Moscow Kremlin. No wonder that every character in Snatch tries to get it. Among them, low-levels gangsters of all sorts of mafia, including Jewish, Russian, and London based. Add to the mix the Irish Gypsies ""who can't be trusted"" because whatever they say could not be understood even by the native English speakers. Don't forget a sadistic crime boss who keeps huge pet pigs with very specific diet. And then there is a dog that likes to snatch and swallow things. All sorts of things.

I've seen Snatch many times. It is one of my favorite movies that I can watch from any scene and I would not switch the channel on it. I think it is the best Ritchie's film. A lot of his fans prefer ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" but my favorite is certainly Snatch. It is so perfect in its nastiness. It does not preach anything; it does not have deep message or any other purpose than to entertain and entertain it does. I've seen it so many times that I happily expect the familiar hilarious quotes or scenes or exchanges between the characters which are the best part of the movie. I pay attention to the soundtrack and to Ritchie's style that is known for frequent fast cuts and quick edits.  Just want to mention that the same technique was also successfully used in his latest, Rocknrolla in one of the most hilarious sex scene I've ever seen.  Ritchie likes to return to the same point in time several times to tell the story (or to show it) from the different points of view. The scenes of violence, sometimes grotesque, have been staged and choreographed so well that you can't help admiring them and smile while watching.  I enjoy acting by everyone and I believe that the famous (and not so famous but very talented) actors had as much fun playing their outrageous characters as I did following them on the dark and gloomy streets of London underworld.

Snatch is enormously enjoyable -on one condition though. You have to appreciate this kind of dark humor that goes together with strong violence. Otherwise, I have something to declare - stay away from it.",1245369600,4,3120,4.79182156133829

When you are dealing with so many characters that is def hard to do and pulls it off with this one...the cast and the story are spectacular and I feel that if given a fair shot with anyone, they will enjoy this movie all most as much as I did",1242777600,3,768,4.3776223776223775
1300878,2,B00003CXS4,"After the huge (and much deserved) success of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Guy Richie must have practically been begged to replicate it on a bigger budget and with big-name actors. The resulting movie, ""Snatch"", although just as successful, if not more so, than its forerunner, however, just isn't quite up to the standard set by Richie's first film.

The greatest strength of ""Lock, Stock..."" was its script. Richie's many stories of British lowlifes neatly intersected to produce one of the most memorable endings of all time. Richie clearly tried to write a similar script with ""Snatch"" and he succeeds to a certain degree - the multiple storylines are present and they do intersect to form a satisfactory ending, but the plot of ""Snatch"" (which centres around a diamond heist and illegal boxing games) is more convoluted than that of ""Lock, Stock..."" (there are too many storylines, which make the film difficult to follow at times) and the storylines don't tie in quite as neatly. While I still remembered the ending of ""Lock, Stock..."" over 10 years after I first saw it, I am having difficulties remembering the details of the ending of ""Snatch"" two days after watching it.

 ""Snatch"" is not a bad film and it contains some very funny stand-alone scenes. The cast is fantastic, although perhaps the film could have benefited from containing fewer big-name actors, since very few of the ""stars"" get the opportunity to shine, and in many ways Brad Pitt's character feels like a carry over from his previous movie, ""Fight Club"" (whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you). Nevertheless, I hesitate to recommend this film. If you happen to find it showing one night on late-night television, then it might be worth giving it a try, but it's definitely not an ""essential"" movie.",1240704000,2,1805,4.853896103896104

1300880,4,B00003CXS4,It's quintessential Guy Ritchie. A plot that has so many sub-plots you almost loose track but somehow it all holds together and works. The English accents can be hard to understand and the Gypsy accents are impossible. But it just adds to the hilarious mayhem of the plot (Ritchie's specialty). Good story. The entire cast is terrific and Brad Pitt is at his best in this kind of character acting. Good directing. I don't ask for any more than that in an escapist flick. This is a good one.,1238457600,,490,4.51685393258427
1300881,3,B00003CXS4,"Guy Ritchie's 2001 film SNATCH intertwines two separate plots among the London criminal underworld. In the first Turkish (Jason Statham) is an unlicensed boxing promoter, trying to ensure his fights for the gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) stayed fixed, in spite of the capricious nature of his boxer Mickey (Brad Pitt). In the second, a diamond stolen by the thief Franky Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro) is sought by the former Uzbek KGB agent Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija), the American jeweler Avi (Dennis Farina), and local pawn shop owner Solomon (Lennie James). The strands are pulled together by plenty of shootouts and some savage animals being set upon some poor victim.

In its varied cast of characters, all up to no good, and in its intertwining of separate plots SNATCH is like Ritchie's earlier film LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS writ large. Nonetheless, its action is sufficiently different that it doesn't feel like a repeat. Brad Pitt turns in an admirable performance as an Irish Traveler, with a convincing command of this group's peculiar English accent and sense of humor. I found the film's soundtrack often grating, however, and the lack of any female presence was glaring.

Featuring a terrific cast of many known and not so known actors all creating a character that you will remember and be able to quote by the time the movie ends. That makes repeated viewings all the more fun. Also featuring a clever screenplay and a stylish and very creative direction from Guy Ritchie. Far, far surpassing his feature debut - 'Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels' - in almost every way imaginable. Here the deliciously absurd tone and painfully funny dark humor is spread throughout the entire film, which is where 'Lock, Stock' was thrown off balance. It tried to combine humorous elements with scenes that were just plain old grim. A superb array of interlinked characters who help the movie flow seamlessly. This is also Brad Pitt's finest hour in my opinion, despite being unintelligible for almost the whole film! You watch the film and your loyalties for the characters changes as the film progresses, basically wondering how it can work out OK for all the characters, you won't be disappointed by the ending though.",1219449600,2,1137,4.865979381443299
1300948,4,B00003CXS4,"First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot. By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once. There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points. Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully. The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit.

This film has ""Pulp Fiction"" stamped all over it. They sell the screenplay to ""Pulp Fiction"" in the classics sections of bookstores in England, believing it comparable to ""Bleak House"" and ""Macbeth."" This film was made in the shadow of Tarantino's enormous influence on the Brits who love the antics of down and outers. It has many wonderful bits, combining a kind of Scorsese brutality with a Marx Brothers hilarity. It doesn't quite match its model for invention or genius but it is a lot of fun. It also has the virtue of being politically incorrect and is a tad less romantic than Tarantino's picture, which I remember as cloyingly optimistic.

1301032,2,B00003CXS4,"Certainly this film had a workable and even interesting script, a tale of British underworld boxing and jewel theft. Where ""Snatch"" fails, is the directors apparent belief that each and every character in the film is interesting or as important as the next, and in the films opening, we are ""treated"" to an introduction to the players complete with Fox News like ""swwoooosssh"" effects and title overlays. There are plenty of jump-effects and quick-zooms, techniques that have been played out in these type of genres. Just because you have that ""spice in the cupboard"", does it mean you really have to use it??

Unbelievable also is Brad Pitt. His role is an Irish gypsy with indecipherable speech and slang is comical, but as an underground boxing champ who rings the bells of much larger opponents, he just doesn't have the size or look of someone who could succeed in the ring.

As an unapologetic Yank, the very British nature of this film is also a turnoff. Even if you liked as I did other U.K crime films ( the original ""Get Carter"". ""Longest Day"" etc.), Snatch is very Brit-centric and Euro-flavored, and some terminology used in the film requires more  thinking on the part of this viewer than I want to do while watching what is suppossed to be  entertainment.",1201132800,3,1269,4.754545454545455

Brad Pitt's transformation into a tattooed, Irish ""pikey"" ( gypsy ) is the highlight of the film.  The DVD includes subtitles when Pitt and his gypsy brothers speak their unintelligible dialogue, which is simply wonderful.  ""Do ya like degs?"" Englishman, ""Heh?"" ""Do ye like degs!?"" ""Oh dogs.

In Snatch, several of the actors are back from ""Lock, Stock"", but all playing unrelated characters along side Brad Pitt. The first few minutes of Snatch looked like it was going to be a cash-in imitation of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but Snatch quickly developed its own story and characters.

Both ""Lock, Stock"" and Snatch are stylistically similar presentation-wise in a Pulp Fiction (1994) kind of way: Characters involved with various criminal activity are unaware of each other's presence throughout most of the movie, but then they are ultimately all connected by the closing credits.

There is a lot of violence seasoned with a good amount of black comedy. The acting is great. Ritchie is a master at getting a realistic reaction out of his cast...not just to situations and shocking acts of violence, but to people. The way the cast reacts to Brad Pitt's character is as believable as it is priceless.

Brad Pitt does a great job in this movie. I've seen a lot of criticism about Pitt's acting abilities, but I've got to say that I am mostly impressed with the roles that I've seen him in. And his character in Snatch, due to how well he played it, will stand out in my mind for a long time.

Jason Statham is as good as ever too. Like Samuel L. Jackson, Statham always seems to be the same guy in all of the movies he's in...same persona. And it just works every time.

Looking for a blast from the past with good actors, good action and a good story? Look no further. Here it is. Snatch may not be a collector's item, but it's worth the price.

I was under the impression that this was a comedy - and I really enjoy comedies - but the comedic moments were few and very far between.

1301205,5,B00003CXS4,"Snatch is a fast moving movie with little chance to catch your breath. It moves along at lightening pace showing the dark side of Londons criminal underworld at it's worst. It is a humourous film and one which will please anyone who saw Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

The dialogue is distinctly English and so it will be hard for some to follow easily. Brad Pitts broad Gypsy (Irish?)accent was so authentic I even found it hard to catch all his words. North American residents may struggle at times with this and may actually have to resort to subtitles.

To sum up. The movie is in the  classic Guy Ritchie mould . He seems to have picked up on Tarrantinos thirst for blood in most every scene. However, even the violent scenes are all done very well and with the humourous dialogue it still manages to make you laugh.  The cast all work well together in their respective roles.

I would not hesitate to recommend this movie but anyone who does not like the F word or to see too much blood should maybe try something else.",1153094400,6,1030,4.457446808510638
1301206,4,B00003CXS4,"The plot of Snatch is hard to explain, but while you're watching the movie it's not hard to follow. There are two story lines that eventually cross each other. Two low-level boxing promoters, Turkish and Tommy, get in trouble with a nasty mobster called Brick Top who likes to feed people to his pigs. Brad Pitt plays an incomprehensible Irish gypsy bare knuckle fighter who boxes for Turkish after putting Turkish's boxer in the hospital. His one problem is that instead of taking a dive as instructed, he knocks his opponent out with one punch.

In the other story, Benicio del Toro steals an 86 carat diamond in Belgium, then comes to London to give it to a man named Doug whose American cousin, played by Dennis Farina, is waiting for it.  However, there is a Russian named Boris the Blade who hires two pawn shop owners to steal it for him. Dennis Farina has to leave the states and come to London to find his diamond with the help of a man named Bullet Toothed Tony. The diamond changes hands several times and then there's the cute little dog who eats a squeak toy so he squeaks every time he barks.

Eventually the two story lines cross several times and it all makes sense in the end. Snatch is a fast paced movie with a fair amount of violence and humor. The overall story is clever and the characters are wild and varied. If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, you'd probably like Snatch.",1153094400,2,1399,4.47843137254902
1301207,5,B00003CXS4,"This is one of those movies that I've watched over and over again.  I was never a big Guy Ritchie fan until I watched Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  The fact that Brad Pitt was in this one was also a plus.  Brad Pitt is once again a genius.  He plays an Irishish (such a word?) gypsy who is also a bare knuckle boxer.  This movie is a fast moving story which keeps you riveted to the seat as people are shot, fed to pigs, and the two main characters, Turkish and Tommy are hysterical!  The humor in this movie is so dry.  I fully recommend this movie and I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to give away the story.  You MUST see it.",1149897600,5,651,3.992248062015504
1301208,5,B00003CXS4,"Let me just start off by saying that this is my favorite movie of all time, and I am a 31 year old woman, and not a 14 year old boy obsessed with guns and gangsters.  I first watched this movie on a lark, curious about Madonna's new (then) boyfriend's purported directing talent.  Guy Ritchie completely blew me away with this.  Smart, slick, and stylish, this movie is absolutely amazing.  Everything about this movie delivers.  The fast paced storyline, the amazing ensemble cast, the great soundtrack, and the didn't-quite-see-that-coming ending all amount to an incredibly entertaining ride.

The real stars of this movie are, of course, the stars, most of whom worked on this movie for virtually nothing.  Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Alan Ford, and the then relatively unknown Jason Statham, all bring their A-game without overpower the contributions of any of the other actors.

I would recommend watching this with both the English and Pikey subtitles the first time around.  If you love it and then wish to watch it again, you should be fine to go without the subtitles going forward.  I have probably seen this movie about 25 times and imagine many more viewings in the future.  If you like this movie, I would also recommend checking out Guy Ritchie's first feature film ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" which features many of the same British actors as well as Sting (I think that Sting's wife, Trudie Styler, was one of the producers for ""Snatch"" and that both she and Sting thought that Guy and Madonna would be perfect for one another, introducing them at a dinner at their Italian villa).  ""Lock"" is very similar to ""Snatch"" but just not quite as slick or polished.

It's too bad Madonna ruined Guy.  Any talent that he has, or may have had, seems to have been crushed under to unbelievable weight of her own stardom and career.",1148083200,5,1865,4.769470404984424
1301209,4,B00003CXS4,"I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes.

So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so? Well, because I usually enjoy ""stylish"" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible.

This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.

Something wacky is going on every few minutes in this film. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being ""Bricktop"" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too.

The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , at least here in the States, such as Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.

This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the clich? that ""this is not for all tastes"" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles.",1145577600,6,2426,4.712264150943396

1301211,4,B00003CXS4,"In response to the first review about the Superbit DVD, I thought it would've been the ORIGINAL from the SPECIAL EDITION version, but I was wrong and I did throw my receipt away.  For those who made the same mistake I made, you can buy the SINGLE-DISC EDITION, which is the same 'Disc I' as in the SPECIAL EDITION version.  Once that part is accomplished, you could try and pawn off the DELUXE EDITION SUPERBIT disc somewhere or hand it off to a good friend...*Shrug* that's what I did.

* * * * * * * * * *

Snatch is one of those rare movies where you might not be expecting much out of it, but when you see it, you fall in love with it and it only gets better everytime you see it.  Guy Ritchie (the director) had won a british award for Best Promising Newcomer Director for his previous film 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrell's' which I have not seen yet, but I will be sure to.  Snatch won some british awards as well for: Best Director, Actor (Vinnie Jones), and one for Sound Editing.  Vinnie Jones (Bullet-Tooth Tony) did give a fine performance for not having much acting experience according to his own words, along with Dennis Farina (Cousin Avi), which he always cracked me up in the movie.  Now...You've got Brad Pitt (Fight Club, SE7EN, Ocean's 11/12, etc...), who plays a gypsy, which doesn't have a lot of character when he makes his first appearance, but makes quite an impression when you find out he's a bare-knuckle championship star, along with his fights in the ring with Jason Statham (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrell's) and Stephen Graham (Gangs Of New York)...I wish Benicio Del Toro (Traffic [Won award for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR], Hunted, The Way of the Gun) was in the movie more as the famous, Franky Four-Fingers...Was a promising character from the beginning.  The DELUXE EDITION is great, the scrap book from the movie was fun to cruise through, but I didn't really understand the purpose of the poker set...The cards are cool and creative, heh.  Finally, the Superbit DVD...I remember reading on the back that there a couple features it was suppose to have on it like the Director/Producer commentary, along with the ""Stealing Stones"" Enhanced Branching Mode...They weren't on it...That's when I read the review down below about the correct disc, which is why I only gave this review 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall, the movie is fast-paced, dark, with that Pulp Fiction-type humor, and funny as hell (is reminded of the squeeking dog).  Own it, but remember to get the SPECIAL EDITION, or if you do get the disappointing DELUXE EDITION, keep your receipt and trade it in for the correct 'Disc I'",1142121600,8,2636,4.633047210300429

Don't know if this was widespread or not.

The cards are terrible.  The Suits are diamonds (like in the film) but also boxing gloves, guns and the dog.  WTF mate.  Also the numbers are in a bad font - stretched thin and difficult to read.

1301296,5,B00003CXS4,"Wow....great movie!! In the beginning, I was immediately turned off the minute I heard Brad Pitt's voice- the character he plays- a pikey-gypsy one-punch-fighter-machine obsessed with caravans- I didn't like it. But it grew on me...and the fact that Brad Pitt was able to pull it off suggests he has great versatility as an actor.

This movie is INSANE from beginning to the end. As another reviewer said- watch it with the subtitles on if it is getting hard to follow. I had to watch the beginning of the movie two times through because there are SO many characters and so many mini-story lines going on at the same time...but all characters DO come together in the end- and that is the best part, seeing how everyone runs into each other in the end.

Of course the movie all centers on this huge big-as-a-house diamond that is wanted by everyone basically (except Turkish & Tommy and then of course Mikey and the rest of the pikeys). What is stolen by Frankie 4 Fingers in the very beginning is stolen by Vince, Sol, and Tyrone. Then Boris The Blade steals it away. Then, Doug The Head, Avi, and Bullet Tooth Tony steal it. Vince, Sol, and Tyrone get it back and are in process of delivering it to Brick Top when Doug, Avi, and Tony take it back again. Then....in the very end my two favorite guys, Turkish & Tommy get it. (Yay!)

This movie isn't really about the diamond though. It's about people getting screwed over, fast thinking, and the occasional weird disgusting thing happening. (Like being shot 6 times and STILL not being killed. Or feeding the people you kill to a dozen pigs. Or of course, being able to knock someone clear out with one solid punch.)

1301361,5,B00003CXS4,"""Snatch"" is a wild ride with a complicated plot that centers on a stolen diamond and 3 different gangs who try to steal it.  This was Guy Ritchie's second film after ""Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels.""  I'm looking forward to Ritchie's ""Revolver"" with Jason Statham & Ray Liotta.  Obviously, ""Swept Away"" with wife Madonna starring was a misstep.

The cast is excellent.  Jason Statham is now a star after the two ""Transporter"" films.  As Turkish, he has a droll sense of humor, his own code of ethics and loyalty to his friend Tommy played by Stephen Graham from ""Gangs of New York.""  Turkish serves as the film's narrator.

The obvious scene-stealer is Brad Pitt as the nutty Irish boxer Mickey O'Neil.  Since Pitt's breakthrough role in ""Thelma & Louise"" back in 1991 and through his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for ""12 Monkeys"" (1995), he's developed into one of Hollywood's brightest stars.  The frustrating and amazingly hilarious schtick here is that you can barely understand a word of the inarticulate Mickey's dialogue, yet all his friends nod and agree profusely.  It really is funny once you get into the swing of noncomprehension.  The fight scenes are also excellent.

Somewhat overlooked, but equally impressive is the short cameo of Benicio Del Toro as the Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers who loves crime but has a weakness for gambling.  Del Toro is obviously a highly regarded actor with his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Traffic"" (2000) and his nomination for ""21 Grams"" (2003).  His ability to go from Jewish Orthodox to the volatile Frankie demonstrates great range.

Vinnie Jones plays Bullet Tooth Tony who is hired to find Frankie.  He does a great job.  Jones was excellent in ""Swordfish"" (2001) and is set to appear in next year's ""X-Men 3.""  Lennie James who was in ""Sahara"" this year plays Sol who owns the pawnshop and has two bumbling cohorts to help get him in trouble.  Alan Ford who was in ""American Werewolf in London"" back in 1981 and in ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" last year plays the wild gang leader Brick Top who likes to feed his enemies to the pigs.  Rade Sherbedgia who was in a film ""Fever"" (2003) with Vanessa Redgrave & Angelia Jolie (--makes you wonder, eh?--), plays the delightfully sinister Russian gangster Boris the Blade.  Dennis Farina who had a great cameo in the HBO mini-series ""Empire Falls"" romps around as Avi.  And of course, the dog that swallows the diamond is also tremendously funny!

""Snatch"" is excellent because it combines the MTV-style editing with a complex plot whose unifying element is the stolen diamond.  It's so fast-paced that it demands the viewer to be engaged or get lost in the action.  Ritchie and this excellent cast make this a memorable DVD.  Enjoy!",1128988800,36,2749,4.855913978494623

1301363,5,B00003CXS4,"Some people write in their reviews the movie is braindead, stupid and not funny at all. Well, it depends on what kind of humor you prefer.

If you can't stand all of the listed above - just skip this one.
To my opinion ""Snatch"" is much better then previous Ritchie's work, more than that - it's one of the best criminal comedies. It's more criminal than others, it's more funny than others. Guy Ritchie actually did his best here and created an atmosphere of absurd, chaotic fun. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt is totally different from what we used to see, Dennis Farina is just soooo hilarious! Now I can't normally see him in other movies - I recall ""Snatch"" and begin to laugh hysterically.
The characters' lines are funny and the way they deliver them is even funnier. By the way it's one of the few films I had to watch with captions - I couldn't understand much of being said because of their cockney (if I'm not mistaken) accent.

Or maybe its just that i think Guy Richie is up there with Quentin Tarantino in creating memorable characters. This movie is hilarious and smart at the same time.  Fans of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels will love this movie.  And will like the film quality upgrade not seen in Lock, Stock.

The actors are better for one thing, Dennis Farina is brilliant as the New York diamond merchant who hates to leave his country unless it's to sunny places where drinks are served with little umbrellas. Brad Pitt nearly steals the show as gypsy prize-fighter (accent spot on) who simply won't lie down and ads a thespian savvy and star quality that, let's face it, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrells wasn't exactly rolling in.
The story revolves around shenanigans in the London underground boxing world. Throw big money and lots of bad luck into the mix, sit back and watch the appropriate results ensue. Cue unhinged screen performance by Alan Ford as cockney gangland boss Bricktop, a guy you wouldn't want as your boss, for example, or bank manager. And there's Vinnie Jones, playing the poor defenceless lamb, a role to which he has become naturally accustomed.
The writing is good and tight and the whole package is elegantly put together with a tasteful collection of tunes for the soundtrack. And nice to see American thesps shine in Brit movies, for a change.",1121990400,3,1145,4.817258883248731

Of note is Brad Pitt's acting.  I never gave him much credit before seeing this movie.

Mr. Pitt, if you haven't seen him in this and other quirky roles, would appear to be just another of Hollywood pretty faces. But nobody, as pretty or less, can pull off the low-life, the unwashed, or the sleaze quite like our Brad. He is so extremely talented. It will warm your heart to see him in an entirely different venue, the UK, where few American actors could overcome the good looks and provincial fetters of US only roles. He shines and sweats, (you could almost smell this guy), he seeks vengeance and displays good old Gypsy smarts when the very bad guys burn down the family caravan with his sainted Ma within. Big credits to the artiste who created the tattoos adorning this bare-knuckles champion's stringy body and the costume designer who came up with his leather jacket and hat ensemble.

This and so much, much more could be detailed in a review to exhort readers to see this film. The only thing I can say is that once you gotten to the arm and briefcase scene, you will be glued.",1119312000,4,1554,4.709558823529412

1301461,5,B00003CXS4,"Fans of gangster movies, especially those with some comedy will love this one. I bought this based on the reviews here, and I'm glad I did. Being a fan of movies like ""Weekend at Bernie's"", ""Get Shorty"", ""Formula 51"", and ""The Transporter"", I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. It has superb editing, great acting, and wonderful music. It was so seamlessly made I have to say I am surprised this was not a big hit. But at least apparently it is getting its second wind like ""Get Shorty"" did some time after it was released on DVD. Don't be surprised if we don't see a sequel to this one in a couple years. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie.

It drew me along and familiarized me with the characters as we went down this winding path. The characters you thought would be killed somehow survive, and those you expected not to die are sometimes killed. The ways they are killed are often funny. There truly is genius that went into putting this all together. I didn't use the subtitles and I loved it in its raw in your face form. Most of the dialogue is easily discernable if you have watched Brit movies for awhile. If not it may take you a couple viewings to take it all in. Quite honestly I'm looking forward to watching this again very soon. It has great replayability and plenty of extras on the disc.

1301464,5,B00003CXS4,"This a great film that is well-edited, Brilliantly scored and masterfully acted. And now, a basic overview of the film:

The music-AMAZING. Perfectly matching the film's fast-paced caper nature, the best 2 songs in the film are ""F***ing in the Bushes"" by Oasis, played in the final fight scene of the film and ""Diamond"" by Klint. This song is played in the menu screen and in the character introduction sequence in the film.

The Editing- Crafty and sleek, smooth and mixed. The two best scenes in which Guy Ritchie's imagination is set free are in the character introduction sequence, where each character is shown doing something which blends into the next. For example, when a character named Mickey (played very well by Brad Pitt) picks up a jewelry bag, he is shown throwing it and in a quick change of scenery, another character, Vinny, is shown catching it. The other scene in which the editing is brilliant is in the final bare-knuckle boxing match at the end of the film. The impact of each punch is shown and the sequence switches from fast-motion to slow motion to regular, somehow keeping it from becoming confusing.

The characters- One of the main things I love about this film is the many different unique characters, all of which are introduced in the beginning of the film. The main characters are...

Brick Top- A ruthless gangster whos favorite means of dispatch involves feeding the dead to pigs, (not that gross in the film). As the main enemy in the film, he is the perpetrator of many of the problems that the characters face in the film.

Bullet-Tooth Tony- A bounty-hunter/killer/convincing intimidator for hire who is not all as bad as he sounds. A hilarious character played brilliantly by Vinnie Jones. In a comic twist, this character was shot 6 times in one sitting and had the bullets molded into gold and put in as fillings in his teeth. A very intimidating and funny character who adds to the film greatly.

Vinny & Sol- Two very funny jewelry store owners who are hired by Boris the Blade(mentioned later) to rob Brick Top's illegal bookies. The robbery goes terribly and hilariously wrong. These two sarcastic and teasing characters are a pair of idiots who somehow become mixed up into the story.

Tyrone- Vinny & Sol's hired getaway driver who isn't much of a driver at all. The sequence in which it takes him forever to get out of the car makes me laugh hysterically every time.

Boris the Blade- Otherwise known as Boris the Bullet-dodger. An impossible to kill, sneeky and devious weapon-selling russian who hires Vinny & Sol to rob Brick Top's bookies and steal the diamond which started all the mayhem from Franky Four-Fingers(mentioned later).

Franky Four-Fingers- The gambling-obsessed thief who steals the diamond that starts the mayhem.

Turkish and Tommy- Turkish is a boxing promoter who works for Brick Top, against his will, and Tommy is his trouble-prone partner.

Mickey- My personal favorite character, Mickey is a gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion who is barely understandable throughout the movie but is still very important to the plot.

The plot- Although very confusing to explain, the plot is simply a loy of mayhem coming from one stolen diamond. Believe me, it's better than it sounds.

A well-made and brilliant film that is a must-see for film-lovers everywhere.
Post your opinion please.",1108339200,10,3353,4.902826855123675
1301465,4,B00003CXS4,"4.5 stars.  Guy Ritchie's first film was the energetic ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" with its kinetic film editing and highly creative direction.  Much like Quentin Tarantino's first film ""Reservoir Dogs"" Guy Ritchie's first film was not as polished as their respective follow-up films.  For Quentin Tarantino his next creation was the landmark film ""Pulp Fiction"" which improved on every aspect of his first endeavor but with a more complicated storyline and more streamlined direction.  The same can be said of Guy Ritchie's second film, ""Snatch.""  His first film was fun and often exhilarating with its stylshly shot gun fights and elegant camera work.  But with ""Snatch"" the end result is more fluid, the interwoven plot-lines loaded with interesting characters and snappy British slang and wit (some of which may be a bit difficult to pick up on for first-time viewers).  ""Snatch"" also has a fine cast of international actors, easily the most notable being Brad Pitt (a bare-kuckle boxing champion gypsy) who steals every scene he is in.  No other character is as memorable as his, but all have their moments.  The actual filmmaking in ""Snatch"" is superb, with all the kinetic editing techniques used in ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" taken to a whole new level with additional freeze-framing, fantastic slow-motion photography, and some great sound-editing that hook scenes together.  Just watch the final bare-knuckle boxing match near the end of the film if you want to see how stylish Guy Ritchie's direction can be.  This is an entertaining gangster film with great characters and inspired direction from Guy Ritchie.  This is the British equivalent to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction.""

1301560,5,B00003CXS4,"If, as currently seems possible, Guy Ritchie's career as a director of unconventional British crime movies has come to a premature conclusion, it's truly a great loss for the film world.  In his first two movies, Ritchie created a pair of classics that effectively mixed action, comedy, and intrigue with a flair the likes of which you'll rarely find.  With Snatch, he succeeded for the second time at crafting a gangster flick filled with colorful characters and bizarre happenings and managing to be rather original in the process.  Sure, fans of Quentin Tarantino will recognize the disjointed time frame, violent excess and general amorality present in Ritchie's films, but Ritchie outdoes his American counterpart in his committment to lightning-fast pacing and outrageous humor.  This guy is truly a visual stylist of the highest order.

Like its predecessor, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch concerns gangsters and thievery in the less reputable sections of London, and like its predecessor Snatch is a hyperactive roller coaster ride of a movie that replaces the deep gravity of such old-time gangster flicks as the Godfather with Ritchie's stylized violence and offbeat characterizations.  Right from the opening scene, when a gang led by the aptly named Franky Four Fingers stages a daring jewelry heist while dressed as a group of Hasidic Jews, this movie offers the promise of something different, and it more than delivers.  For most of its running time Snatch borders on sheer sensory overload, with Ritchie's camera cutting constantly and the laughs coming as fast as the bodies pile up.  Bullets, fists, and profanities all fly as a seemingly endless number of plot strands come together, leading up to a blood-soaked finale that makes the conclusion of a John Woo movie seem almost tame by comparison.

Despite everything I've written above, it's really the dialogue and characterization that elevate Snatch above the crime-movie plain.  This movie doesn't just show you a bunch of colorful criminal types, it actually manages to make you like some of them, although maybe not always for the best reasons.  Here Ritchie assembled an extremely diverse ensemble cast, and it's one filled with memorable and perfectly portrayed figures ranging from a shady unlicensed boxing promoter to a legendary thug with two bullets for teeth to a local mob kingpin with a highly unusual method of disposing of victims.  Of course, it's the surprise casting of Brad Pitt that raised a lot of eyebrows when this movie came out, and with good reason.  Pitt strays far from his typical fare with his portrayal of a fast-talking gypsy boxing champ, but he's note-perfect in his role, right down to his semi-intelligible accent.  Ever since I watched Seven and Fight Club years ago, I've thought Pitt was an excellent character actor who just happened to be a star, and this movie only served to confirm that impression.  Vinnie Jones is once again brilliant as well in his role as Bullet Tooth Tony, even if his calm-and-collected-one-minute-raving-lunatic-the-next role isn't much of a stretch from his work in Lock, Stock.

Throughout its relatively brief running time, Snatch never lets up its frenetic pace, ensuring that even those possessed of the shortest attention spans won't wind up bored.  Now, as many have noted, Snatch isn't much of a depature from Ritchie's first film, right down to the repeated casting of Jason Statham in a leading role.  That fact notwithstanding, though, there's something to be said for staying in the same niche, especially when that niche isn't exactly being filled by too many other people at the moment.  Anyone who can churn out such distinctive and entertaining movies should be welcomed, regardless of such piddling complaints as repetitiveness.  Now, where's the third movie?",1101600000,3,3831,5.158319870759289
1301561,4,B00003CXS4,"Words can't exactly describe this film so perhaps this will sum it up: cockney criminals, underground boxing, and a big juicy diamond.

Vinnie Jones & (the incredible) Jason Statham from ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" return and Hollywood top dogs Benicio Del Toro & Brad Pitt join the cast. Pitt (who once again is swinging his fists as he did in ""Fight Club"") is hysterical as Mickey the mumbling Irish gypsy. Word to the wise: before starting the movie, go to the subtitle options and select ""Pikey, what did you say"" so you can understand what Pitt is saying through his jumbled speech.

""Smoking Barrels"" was great but ""Snatch"" blows that movie out of the water. It has more action, more humor, a surprise ending and of course, a terrific cast.  I love watching British crime & caper/action films and ""Snatch"" is one of the best to cross the pond.",1100131200,3,860,4.682119205298013
1301562,4,B00003CXS4,"_Snatch_ is a hard-hitting, fast-paced, fun film.  From the opening of the film, where we are introduced to the gigantic cast of misfits (each with hilarious nicknames and wonderful rich personas), _Snatch_ takes the audience on an incredibly entertaining and hilarious adventure that is a delight to watch.  While many have criticized the film for being a copy of _Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, or a sequel to that film, I would argue that it is exactly what we wanted.  While I would love to see Guy Ritchie extend himself beyond his current scope, I think that he does what he does really well.  I loved his first film and I loved _Snatch_.  At the end of the day, a good cockney gangster film is still a good film.  Period.

_Snatch_ is a success because of its characters, many of whom I would love to see explored further in other films-Brad Pitt's performance as an Irish Gypsy Boxer is an obvious frontrunner of the pack.  These characters are allowed to develop and display their quirky selves, largely due to the wonderfully written script.  The dialogue in this film is stunning-both engaging and hilarious at the same time.

Once again, I simply do not know what people are talking about when they describe the film as a difficult one.  The accents are not hard to decipher at all, with the exception of Brad Pitt's character.  In those instances where the dialogue does fall off, it seems utterly intentional on Ritchie's part and adds to the character development in the film.  Secondly, the movie's multiple storylines are spliced rather well and I do not think that the average film viewer will have trouble piecing together the plot.  As has been stated, the plot is not complicated in the least-it is simply how Ritchie spices up an old, well-traveled story.

If you want to have a good time watching a British gangster film, give _Snatch_ a look.  You will not be disappointed.",1099526400,,1903,4.721212121212122

1301564,4,B00003CXS4,"I really wish that I could give half-star ratings, because I think this movie deserves 3 and a half stars instead of 4, but since I can't, I'll be generous and round up.

This movie is (I think) Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels; it involves some of the same cast members and themes.  The movie follows the intersecting storylines of three main groups of people.  Criminals and boxing ""promoters"" Turkish (Jason Statham), his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham), and their prospects Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), who is a Pikey or a gypsy.  Then there are the jewel thieves Sol (Lennie James), Vinny (Robbie Gee), and their getaway driver Tyrone (Ade).  Also, there are the Denovitz cousins Avi (Dennis Farina) and Doug ""The Head"" (Mike Reid), their courrier ""Four-Finger"" Frankie (Benicio Del Toro), and their muscle ""Bullet Tooth"" Tony (Vinnie Jones).  Also, there are two characters who transcend the groups.  There is ""Brick Top"" Polford (Alan Ford) and Boris ""The Blade"" or Boris ""The Bullet-Dodger"" (Rade Serbedzija).  It would be very hard to condense the intertwining stories to fit into this review, so basically, there's this 86 carat diamond that the Denovitz brothers and Boris are both hunting down.  It falls into various characters hands throughout the film, as each character finds a need for it (besides the astronomical value of it).  For example, the jewel thieves need it to pay of Brick Top because they stole from him.

The writing and acting for this movie were pretty good.  I mean, the story wasn't anything totally original, but Ritchie kept things interesting.  On the acting, yes, the actors did a good job, but due to thick British accents, I could barely hear a word they were saying.  As for Brad Pitt's character, the joke was that we nor the characters in the film were supposed to understand him.

This film is definitely not for everyone.  While I don't see it as pure British humor, in order to enjoy it, one does need to at least be able to tolerate some British humor.  Also, not everyone will be able to follow the intersecting storylines.  But don't let me discourage you, this is a very funny movie.

Watching Snatch for the first time is to be jerked around (and hopefully entertained somewhat) by its elaborate but ultimately meaningless plot. To the watch it for the second or third time is to hang out with your old pals Turkish and Bullet-Tooth Tony, and to notice the little details of their performances which make their characters so vivid and endearing. Maybe not everyone will fall in love with this cast of thieves and murderers, but I think the reason for the comedic nature of the movie, whether Richie intended it or not, is to make it easier to relate to and sympathize with the characters. Someone else, hearing me describe the film, wondered if _any_ of the characters could be sympathetic, but in the end I think that all of them are. Even Brick Top. As Richie relates in the 'making of' documentary: 'I wanted him to be a character that people genuinely disliked...and I thought What do people really hate, and the first thing that came to mind was paedophiles. But my Brazilian cameraman pointed out to me...In England, molesting children is one thing, and torturing dogs is another. So I decided to have him torture dogs. And it was supposed to make the audience dislike him, but I found it had rather the opposite effect.' Indeed, seeing Brick Top's cheerful, earnest grin as he pokes a sharp stick between the bars of a dog's cage makes it awfully hard to dislike him.

1301615,5,B00003CXS4,"SNATCH, the latest film from Guy Ritchie's catalogue, continues the rollicking line of English gangster cinema spawned by the writer/director.  Once again, Ritchie manages to tie up all the loose ends of a variety of capers into one, big, package of corruption set in London and centered on one fist-sized stolen diamond.  Pulling from the same crowd of actors in his last hit Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, the director almost creates a sequel.  The film is full of talent, from the writing to the acting to the fantastic dialogue and on down even to the music.
  SNATCH stars some of today's biggest actors such as Benicio DelToro (TRAFFIC; THE USUAL SUSPECTS) and Brad Pitt (LEGENDS OF THE FALL; SE7EN; FIGHT CLUB) as tiny, yet extremely important characters.  Rarely do you find such talent filling in supporting roles in foreign films.  But, both DelToro and Pitt portray their characters beautifully.
  Pitt plays Mickey, a fast-talking, tattoo-sporting, gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion who refuses to go down in a series of illegal boxing matches.  DelToro stars as a Frankie Four Fingers, a Jewish gangster with some what of a gambling problem - he has debts he can't pay, so they give him the chop, hence the name.  Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is another actor hailing from our hemisphere.  Farina plays Frankie's cousin who hates England and hates the fact that he has to fly over there and get Frankie out of trouble.
  But, though the semi-American supporting actors do give the movie that good bit of USA flavor, it is the English cast that really makes the flick.  Turkish (Jason Statham) is a simple boxing promoter who is trying his hardest to avoid the crime lord of the illegal boxing world, Brick Top (Alan Ford).  Brick Top is known for feeding those he doesn't like to the pigs.  Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia) is trying to steal Frankie's diamond, but Frankie is off gambling on unlicensed boxing.  Meanwhile, Cousin Avi hires Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones - GONE IN 60 SECONDS) to locate Frankie.  Well before long, the entire state of affairs is so tangled up Ritchie himself could only put it right by killing off half the people involved, shoving the diamond down the mouth of a stray dog, and burning a few trailers.  Don't understand what I could possibly be talking about?  Rent this movie, and you'll get the picture.
  The only foreseeable problem I can envision with this flick is that you'll probably have to watch it a couple of times before you finally get the real jist of it.  Like Lock, Stock... it is impossible to take it all in on the first run-through.  So, I recommend you grab a beverage and a companion of your choice (be it man, woman, or beast), slip this cinematic masterpiece into your DVD/VCR, prop your feet up on the coffee table, and get ready to feel the adrenaline as this super-charged crime caper gets your heart going and reminds us insane Americans of our fanatical UK roots.",1077840000,3,2948,4.778656126482214

Snatch is a bunch of stories within a big story. You've got a stolen diamond that no one can seem to hold on to, underground boxing, gangs, and what modern gangst tail wouldn't have the russian and some ex kgb. Snatch has it all and it's fun wathcing each story develop in the film.
Guy Ritchie wrote and directed this one and he has made some excellent characters. You gotta love Brad Pitt's characther Micky the gypsy barefisted boxing champions. Jason Statham is great as Turkish the boxing promoter who things just go bad for. There are a lot of other fun characters in the movie and that's where the driving part of the movie comes from.
Snatch is a great film. I liked it a lot and would reccomend it to just about everybody. Fans of British humor will really get a kick out of it, and so will Brad Pitt fans. He does a great job in the film. I own the film and I'm glad to say I do.",1075420800,,1083,4.211538461538462

This is great stuff. Even though Pitt spends a bit too much time with his shirt off (my wife loved that part), it's difficult to describe him as ""pretty"" in this movie. His performance has further won me over to his side - he's an absolute riot! Thank God for the subtitles!
There are many memorable characters in ""Snatch"", and many great lines. The jump cuts and Brit slang, which some previous reviewers have criticised, are, to me, a big part of the fun. I found myself laughing out loud at several points, and smiling the whole way along.

1301724,3,B00003CXS4,"I had heard a lot of good things about SNATCH before I eventually got around to seeing it.  And when I did see it, I found myself feeling vaguely underwhelmed.  It's not a bad film; there are many great individual scenes.  But as a whole, it didn't quite work for me.  If I was feeling unkind, I might say that I was unimpressed because, after all, I'd already seen it the first time, when it was called PULP FICTION.
That is a little unfair of me.  SNATCH isn't a total rip-off of that film.  But much of it seems very familiar.  I've already seen the scene of two tough characters having a conversation in a vehicle about irrelevancies.  I've already seen people shot or run over for comic effect.  I've already seen apparently dissimilar gangster plots become intertwined through massive coincidences (and I think Quentin Tarantino's film was better at making its separate plot strands converge logically).  In short, I really didn't feel that the story I was watching was very original at all.
On the other hand, in a purely visual sense, SNATCH was astonishingly clever.  The camerawork is quick, inventive, and very original.  There are lots of little camera tricks, quick zooms, and flashy effects.  Fortunately, director Guy Ritchie is focused enough not to allow these to become annoying.  But even as the story was boring me, the direction kept me paying attention.  I would almost recommend this film to someone purely for its visual style.
I think the main thing that turned me off of this movie was the fact that I simply wasn't interested in any of the characters.  Unpleasant, unsympathetic people can often work well in movies.  You either want to cheer for them anyway, or you want to see them get what's coming to them.  But neither occurred here.  I simply didn't care if any of them lived or died.  The characters were far too superficial for me to invest interest.
And despite the large cast, you get the feeling that they all live in a tiny universe -- a universe where the characters in this film are the only people who live in it.  That's the only explanation I have for why they keep running into each other, when the simple law of averages would suggest otherwise.
In short, I found SNATCH to be a case of style reigning over substance.  It's not horrible; I just didn't enjoy it very much.  If I want to see PULP FICTION, then I'll just watch that film instead.  That said, I did like Ritchie's use of the camera, so I'll probably look for some of his other films, hoping that he has a better script there to go with his directing skills.  The problem was that the directing tricks didn't stick with me.  While I had a vaguely positive view of the film immediately after viewing it, the next day I realized that the only things I enjoyed were a few hilarious individual scenes and the optics.  The movie as a whole just bored me.",1058745600,5,2857,4.56188605108055

While Brad Pitt is genius in the role of a gypsy bare-knuckle fighter, Jason Statham, with poker faced portrayal of a illegal fight promoter is his best role yet.  He makes you laugh with his slightly sarcastic remarks and his seeming confusion about just how he got himself mixed up with this crazy gypsy and the most dangerous fight promoter by the name of Brick Top who has an unhealthy affinity for pigs.

The film has a host of subplots all shrewdly linked to the main storyline and a wealth of characters including a couple of likeley Cockney lads who are two novice unlicensed boxing promotors, Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), fellow boxing promotor Brick Top (Alan Ford), Mickey O'Neil played by Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy who gets roped into the boxing match where his opposition is rigged to win, Avi (Dennis Farina) as the man due to deliver a stolen 86 carat diamond and Bullet Tooth Villain (Vinnie Jones) who Avi hires to trace the diamond after he is robbed.

But once it settles down and we get into the flow of it, it is a very entertaining, even hilarious, movie.
Brad Pitt does a superb job and shows once more why he is not only a big star but a fine actor. All the actors in this are excellent. It's a film about confusion, dumb plots, and drastic mistakes made by people who think they're smart when really they are all dumb as lamposts.
This movie is made with real flair and an ear for ""talk."" I would suggest watching it with ENGLISH SUBTITLES ON. This is the great innovation of DVD and it makes the picture a bit more coherent. There is a section when Pitt delivers one of his prodigious mumbles that the subtitles simply give up. It is actually totally invented by Pitt.

Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones are great in their roles, and Benicio del Toro does well in his rather understated role.  Rade Sherbedgia is hilarious as Boris the Blade.
The camera work is excellent.  Guy Ritchie uses some great camera techniques that work well and really throw you into the movie.  The soundtrack is varied and excellent.  You won't see a song from The Specials and an Oasis song on one soundtrack very often.  The music is used very well and sets the tone and pacing for the scene.  The sound quality is excellent, and the transfer, even on the regular release, is one of the better ones I've seen.
The special features are interesting...not too involving, but some of the deleted scenes are hilarious and really should've made the final cut of the movie.

1301885,4,B00003CXS4,"Granted, as it has been written before, ""Snatch"" breaks very little cinematic ground when compared to Guy Ritchie's equally entertaining debut ""Lock Stock"". He uses many of the same high octane editing and super smooth camera angles as well as snappy smart dialouge that is hip, profane and quotable much in the vein of Tarantino. And because of that overriding similarity to the previous film, ""Snatch"" a very very entertaining and intoxicating work in its own right, suffers from the ""been there done that blues"".
That said, ""Snatch"" possesses a phenomenal ensemble of character actors all playing at the top of their game. There is not a weak sister to be found in the 98.9% male cast (save for the all too brief turn by the charming twins!). Like Tarantino, Ritchie structures his films like novels. He manages to balance character exposition with true development. It is far too rare to see real character development in contemporary film.
Where Ritchie surpases Tarantino, is in his ability to be hip without resorting to the endless self-conscious parade of pop culture reference. Tarantino's characters are often too self aware, while Ritchie manages to create beings that live truly in the moment, without awareness of the world at large.
Ritchie does need ( like Tarantino!) to vary he work, or he will end up repeating himself endlessly and lose the audience he so richly deserves.
Snatch is a great DVD also. The extras are a delight. The ""making of"" documentary really shows care and insight. The atmosphere that Ritchie creates on the set fosters the high energy spunk of his movies. The deleted scenes add fleshing out to the detail heavy movie and are a blast in their own right. A special feature allows the viewer to re-insert the deleted scenes into the film.

But, after you see it, you will need to repeat the process a few times.  If you have friends (you better know them well), this is a great way to kill time, as it is better to watch it in a group.

You've got to be on your toes to watch this fast paced, fast thinking, fast talking, comedy/suspense/gore-fest....written and directed by none other than Guy Ritchie.  It is smart and back and forth and sideways, but it is incredibly entertaining, now I'll try to explain it somehow.  Del Toro steals a diamond, Pitt gets into a fight, everyone want the diamond back, no one understand Pitt when he talks, and then there's the squeaky dog.  If that didn't make sense, watch the movie....you'll be lost too, for the first half hour, then it'll all be coming together, then everyone gets their own in the end and I can't say everyone lives happily ever after, but it works out.  It's well worth the ride, I hope you enjoy it....there's bungling robbers, the Russian guy who won't die, and that boxing promoter from hell who owns a pig farm.....trust me watch.

1301959,5,B00003CXS4,"I thought Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels was one of the best outrageously wild comedies I'd ever seen until I saw Snatch.  Following the same movie genre as Lock Stock, (which is very Pulp Fictionesque), and bringing back a majority of the raucious cast of characters, Snatch hits a home run and really rates 10 stars on my scale of 1 to 5.  The story goes from about 0 to 100 in about 4.7 seconds, which means it's bit complecated to explain, but not hard to follow.  Most of the story takes place in London so be warned the thick and heavy English diologue may confuse you at times, but that's what subtitles are for. Either way it's a fun and energetic movie that casts Brad Pitt as a Gypsie Irishman only your subtitles can understand. With characters like Bullit Tooth Tony, Bricktop and Boris the Bullit Dodger, you know your in for a wild ride.
On a different note be sure to buy this version and not the Superbit. As Iv'e noticed with most Superbit DVDs the level of detail you gain pales in comparison to the special features you lose. Finally, get the soundtrack as well, you'll love it.",1030060800,6,1099,4.430693069306931

I msut say this movie isn't for all audiences, expecially children, and adults who can't find humor in  sarcastic/dark comedy.  However for those of us who enjoy a sarcastic look at the world laced with just the right amount of humor, and a plot to complicated to explain, this is the movie for you!!!",1029369600,,502,4.483516483516484
1301961,4,B00003CXS4,"""Snatch"" is a gangster/action film that is most certainly a cut above the rest of this genre's offerings that I have seen in a while. Director Guy Ritchie really pulled no punches with this twisted tale of a diamond, and the chaos that it causes. The film takes place in London, mostly, and is centered on several main characters. The most memorable being Brad Pitt as a bare-knuckle boxing piker (by far the best performance of the film and one of the best of his career I thought). But all of the performances in this film were great. The actors did a great job. Pretty much everything worked in this film, especially the script. The dialogue was fantastic. Some of the best I've seen in a while. The directing was also fantastic. Guy Ritchie has a bit of a unique approach to directing, but it really works in this film. The movie moves along at a somehwat rapid pace most of the time and it kept my interest pretty much the whole way through.
I would give a summary of the plot line, but it is rather complicated and I'm sure one of the other 200 people who reviewed this already have. I will, however, say that the plot is good and I liked it.
The dvd is a very nice package. You can watch the film in Widescreen or Fullscreen. It actually gives you the option! It would be nice if more dvds picked up on this great feature. The picture and audio are both acceptable and the menus are clean and nice. There are a bunch of extras spanning a 2 disc set and have the usual suspects.
If you're a fan of gangster films, action films, dark comedies or Guy Ritchie's style of directing, then I highly recommend this film. Very Entertaining. 4 stars!",1029110400,2,1647,4.368078175895765
1301962,3,B00003CXS4,"Not the greatest comedy I saw this year, but I must applaud Brad Pitt in a stellar performance of a incomprehendible piker burned-out bare-knuckle boxer. The flick was fairly drawn out in portions, but somewhat memorable nonetheless.",1028073600,,233,5.324324324324325
1301963,4,B00003CXS4,"'Snatch' has many similiar story elements to 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' but has a better cast and, in my opinion, is just as much fun to watch.  In the immediate wake of Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' it seemed that every shootemup movie was being compared to Tarantino's work.  While I would still place PF and RD slightly above Ritchie's movies, I love them and feel that they can both be fairly compared to Tarantino's.
'Snatch' has a great soundtrack and the DVD will even let you turn on subtitles exclusively for the pikeys.  One thing that I like about Snatch is that, like in Lock Stock, all the scenes of violence are never shown directly.  While there is still more than a healthy amount of violence in these movies, it is nice that you never actually have to see someone getting shot or stabbed.
Oh and, I almost forgot to mention, this movie is hilarious.  Rent it first to see if its your kind of movie, but if you really love Tarantino and were disappointed by the last few incarnations of 'from dusk til dawn.' you may just want to go ahead and buy this one.",1026950400,2,1100,4.48
1301964,4,B00003CXS4,"I was irritated with the first half hour or so of this movie, as it looked like yet another attempt to rip-off Quentin Tarantino.  This is not always bad, since it would be nice if Tarantino released a movie once in awhile.  But this one started off to me as a blatant imitation, with it's low-life gangsters with fancy nicknames spouting off intricate dialog.  And that's when you can understand a word they are saying, especially Brad Pitt.
But once the plot gets established and the cast is able to gel, I enjoyed watching it, and was wondering how certain situations were going to be resolved.  The movie is still Tarantino-ish, in that every character is a crook.  The two major capers here involve the theft of a diamond that could choke a buffalo.  The people interested in this rock are also involved in an underground fight game, ironically involving Brad Pitt, who still has his physique from the orgininal ""Fight Game"".
Now the fights themselves are an interesting situation.  They seem to be popular, and of course have a lot of betting action on them.  But they all also seem to be fixed, which you would think would keep serious bettors away once the word gets out.  But when the fix doesn't always work, then those putting money on it would have to be betting if the fix was ""legit"" or not.
Which is why it gets interesting after awhile.  Brad Pitt enters the fight game after pulling a scam to sell a mobile home to some of the fight flunkies, one of which is a star fighter.  When the scam is discovered, the fighter takes on Pitt, and Pitt immediately cleans the guy's clock.
 Faced with needing a fighter or literally getting fed to pigs ala ""Hannibal"", they recruit Pitt to take his place, under the condition that he has to take a dive in the fourth round.  When Pitt's ego/stupidity results in another easy win, it sinks the surrounding mob guys into further pig doo doo.
I am not giving anything away here because the setup of the movie is that for the NEXT fight, Pitt is instructed to dump again.  Whether he does or not I will leave to your viewing, as they leave it unclear until the very end whether Pitt is going to play ball this time or not, and what will be the aftermath depending on that decision.  I thought all of this was very well handled.
Throughout all of this is intertwined the caper of ""diamond, diamond, who's got the diamond"".  This all involves Benicio del Toro as the guy unfortunate enough to have it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, a psycopathic Russian to whom the handcuffs are not a barrier, Dennis Farina who comes in from America, and three bumbling characters who don't seem to know what to do with it when they have it.  If one considers this all fun, then this is one fun movie.",1026777600,,2742,4.473895582329317

1301966,5,B00003CXS4,"I had no idea what I was in for when I decided to watch ""Snatch,"" but am I ever glad I took the time to watch this movie.  Let me say this: this has to be THE BEST CRIME CAPER MOVIE I have ever seen!  Wow, this is such a great movie...I don't know what else to say.
Just imagine a caper movie where everything that could possibly go wrong does.  Imagine a movie where different conflicts and interests drags all of these characters together in a unpredictible situation.  Imagine.....a dog that can swallow an entire squeeze toy ball??  Very possible in this movie, in fact, that's all I can tell you.  I don't want to give anything away.
Performances in this movie: very top knotch.  Brad Pitt once again shows how talented of an actor he is (and you can't even understand what the hell he's saying!!!!).  The writing is very original and clever, bringing tons of twists, crazy characters, and the most ridiculous scenarios to the tablle; with the end result being a very ingenious movie where everything all comes together and makes sense.  Brilliant directing, as well.  I like the slow-motion sequences; very clever and well-structured.
The DVD is very high quality as well.  Lots of special features, concidering this is a two disk set.  Haven't gotten through all of them, yet, but I liked what I saw.  The picture quality is very good and the sound quality is off the hook.  I was amazed by how good this movie sounded.  I'll have to get the soundtrack if I get the chance.
Despite what critics may think, this is a very clever and hillarious crime caper that will have you laughing like you would never believe.  This is one I will be sure to watch over and over again.  I am sorry if I couldn't get into too much detail about the story, but that would ruin the movie.  The best part of the movie is that it catches you off guard, showing you something you would never expect.  I went into seeing this movie without knowing a thing about it, except that is was a caper movie.  I am glad I didn't read any reviews that would give away the story.  All in all, ""Snatch"" is an amazing film that pulls no punches.  See this one as soon as possible!  I loved every minute.",1025136000,5,2174,4.407035175879397

1302058,5,B00003CXS4,"I watched this movie in the summer, but from that one viewing, I couldn't really review it. So I waited, and I got it again last night and watched it twice.
A second viewing is required to fully enjoy this movie. A first viewing, and you will say, ""Pretty good!"". A second viewing and you will say, ""This is so awesome!""-and every other word that is a synonym to awesome.
Slick, stylish, funny-everything you could want in this type of movie. Intermixing storylines give this movie a nice touch, especially when a person from one of the storylines does something that impacts the other storyline without even knowing it.
Each character in this movie contributes to the overall effect. By themselves, the characters may be boring. Together, each and every character compliments the other characters, meaning that they all suddenly become a whole lot funnier and more interesting.
The reason I needed the second viewing was also because I couldn't understand half of what was being said the first time I watched it. The second time, everything became clear, and suddenly, I understood the whole plot. The third time I watched it, I could understand 5/6 of what Mickey was saying. (and that is an accomplishment in itself) Even if you don't understand the characters (and as you see, half the characters in the movie itself can't understand Mickey either) it is still an enjoyable film. The best parts in this are definitely the ones where the storylines touch each other. Example-the three cars scene, the hallway scene, and even the dogs and a hare scene.
Tyrone and his ""funny angle"" part held a special laugh for my cousin, who backed into a Jaguar one day, and said almost the exact same thing.
Great acting from every single actor/actress here. This is the third film that I've watched with del Toro in it, and he hasn't disappointed me yet. (the others were Traffic and The Usual Suspects) Brad Pitt did a worthy job as the ""piker""/gypsy and Statham was great as Turkish.
The best-character-in-the-movie award has to go to...the dog (or the ""dag""). I LOVED the dog-he has the best part in the movie. I won't reveal anything, but let's just say that the name of this movie is most likely derived from this dog.
Also has a killer ending, and a great climax with the boxing match. You don't even really have to see the first movie (yes, this is a sequel) to understand this one-I certainly haven't watched the first yet (called Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) but I understood everything in the movie.

1302059,5,B00003CXS4,"There several interesting aspects of this movie to highlight:
The movie takes place with caracters that seem to come from the down and obscure world of modern England, where robbery and own-hand justice rule the scenario. Then, you will certainly notice the type of language this people use, sometimes impossible to understand and I guess even the English have trouble with it.
Now, with Brad Pitt (Mickey), he may be a pretty face, but in this film he is a tough and rude gypsy bare-knuckle boxer who takes the best out of people (materialisticly speaking, of course) and at the end of the movie... well, you will drop you jaw to the floor when you get there.
It is interesting to notice that this film takes in several completely different stories from totally different people that have to do nothing with each other, until destiny places them in the same place, at the same time and in the nastiest of the situations.
If you saw ""Amores Perros"", this is the type of Snatch. An exciting movie where everything is put together at the best of the movie, and where action is combined with caracter's intelligence to glue you on your seat until the movie is over.
By the way, there wouldn't be movie without the dog, so pay attention to what this amazing fellow does throughout the film.",1024185600,,1286,4.644736842105263
1302060,5,B00003CXS4,"Guy Ritchie is easily one of the most inventive directors around today, as is evidenced by Snatch.  The 2-DVD collection has tons of great features, some of which are hidden.  For example you can see a montage of all of the characters in the movie cursing by pressing the remote directions in a certain order (if I remembered it I would include it).  Otherwise the movie itself is a funny, exciting ride.  Following the misadventures of Turkish and Tommy, two unlicensed boxing promoters, Ritchie manages to make movie not only exciting plot-wise but visually stimulating as well.  The opening sequence of the jewel heist is one of the best openings to a movie that I can think of in recent memory.  The cast is great although not packed with huge names (Brad Pitt excluded).  Regardless each actor plays a unique character that viewers will come to favor (mine is Cousin Avi).

1302062,5,B00003CXS4,"This DVD is excellent.  This is probably one of the only movies I have ever laughed out loud.  Brad Pitt plays a character with a very funny oirish accent.  You can get many more things out of this movie than humor, such as action.  This is a good action movie, a good example would be when Brad Pitt boxes.  The first time I saw this movie was with my friend Jordan, I thought I was going to die laughing - literally. I would recommend this movie to people from the ages of 18+ for the reason that there is profanity in it.  This is a hilarious movie overall; and the accents are just hysterical.

I laughed as much as anyone at Brad Pitt's ridiculous oirish accent, but I loved his character, and felt that it wouldn't be half as good with decent diction.

1302065,4,B00003CXS4,"Critics of this movie get usually harp on its similarity to ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" -- director Guy Ritchie's first feature film. Both have a flashy, gimmicky, rock-video style, Martin-Scorsese-after too much espresso camera tricks and machine-gun editing that often leaves you as dazed as if Muhammad Ali just let you have it with a six-punch combination to the head. They also point out the British fixation on Quentin Tarantino and how both films seem to ape that combination of quirky dialogue, humorously bloody violence, and out-of-sync storytelling that seems to make no sense until the very end, when everything ties up.
These criticisms are all accurate and they are also the reason why most critics are fools. They just can't enjoy a movie for its own sake. You could make a number of 'legitimate' criticisms of ""Snatch"" -- but why waste your time? This movie absolutely rocks. Everything about it from the cast to the dialogue to the soundtrack fits as perfectly as the well-oiled parts of a brand-new pistol. Not a replica pistol either -- a Desert Eagle .50, to be exact.
I'll skip the plot. Other reviewers nailed it. It revolves simultaneously around a stolen diamond and a bare-knuckles boxing match, but the plot is really just a vehicle for A) mayhem and B) Ritchie's terrific cast of characters to do their thing. I am here to tell you they did it. Tip....top.
Jason Statham is spot-on as Turkish, the gruff and unflappable boxing promoter whose withering, double-barreled sarcasm is a far more effective weapon than any gun. Dennis Farina and Vinny Jones are also excellent as a vitriolic diamond dealer named Avi and his sword-wielding, Jaguar-driving, Guinness-drinking thug-for-hire named Bullet Tooth Tony, respectively. Alan Ford gives an Oscar-caliber performance (or what would be an Oscar-caliber performance, if the Oscars ever went to the right bloke)as Brick Top, a local crime lord who wallows in his own villainy like the Lanastershire pigs he keeps to eat the bodies of his numerous victims. But the brass ring goes to Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neil, an unwashed bare-knuckle boxing champ who speaks largely incomprehensible gibberish and comes off as a punch-drunk
half-wit, but ends up being the smartest guy in the film. Actually everybody in the cast delivers the goods and then some, but my Tam O'Shanter is especially off to Pitt, who destroys any remnants of the pretty-boy image that might have survived ""Fight Club.""

The dialogue just crackles. Americans may be defeated by some of the slang, but for the most part Ritchie's characters achieve the very impressive goal of both spitting out tremendously funny, profanity-laden dialogue and always staying in character, something that Tarantino's bad guys never seem capable of doing. Nor is this movie hamstrung by the long, boring, listen-to-my dialogue-isn't-it-quirky-and-original intervals that plagued ""Pulp Fiction."" But comparisons between the two are largely facile. ""Snatch"" is not a better-faster-more version of any other movie: it is its own crazy, crooked, wild ride. But who cares anyway? Another Commonwealth boy, Angus Young, once said about AC/DC's music: ""People always say, 'Those blokes made another album and it sounds just like the last one.' Well, give me more of the same, any time.""",1022457600,3,3324,5.144177449168207
1302066,5,B00003CXS4,"This isn't as good as Guy Ritchie's first film ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", but its still a great film. Ritchie went with what worked from his last film and incorporated it into a different story about a diamond. Ritchie likes to get into detail with each of his characters. Each gets his own intro, and some get their own themes. This helps the audience relate better to the characters and understand them better.
Overall, there are a lot of sub-plots and stars in this great flick about the search for ""a diamond the size of a fist"". A lot of action, snappy dialogue, and plot twisting is involved.
But be forewarned, if you don't like films where most of the characters have accents, use a lot of slang, and try to kill people  .... then go watch a freakin' Disney movie and keep living in happy happy land.",1022457600,,821,4.473333333333334

1302143,4,B00003CXS4,"Following the wave of movies about underground gritty British gangsters/drug pushers that began with Trainspotting, Snatch seems to rise above the sludge of its subject matter.  It bolsters a tight well-thought plot that (directorially and theamatically) snaps into place.  The movie holds an endearing charm as we follow its vivacious characters around England.  Bullet Tooth Tony almost steals the show from Brad Pitt as the quarky independant minded thug, but Pitt pulls the carpet away from Tony's feet with his beautiful ending.
All in all it seems as if the movie's director has spent years tightening up and editing his characters.  Indeed we even feel as if we have seen these wonderful pranksters before.  In reality that's not far off.  Ritchie's first film Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels seems like, if not a preliminary version of Snatch, at least a prequel.  Still, even though Snatch may not get an A+ in originallity, it did gain from the amount of work Ritchie has done in this area.  His expertise make for a wonderfully fast and visually stimulating experience.

1302144,4,B00003CXS4,"Snatch is a fast-paced gangster thriller from England. Like many such British films, it is equal parts drama and black comedy. Our friends in the UK may take crime seriously, but they can't bring themselves to do the same with criminals. Perhaps there is a lesson for us there. I thoroughly enjoyed Snatch, but I must warn you that the accents can sometimes be hard to understand. The one used by Brad Pitt is intentionally indecipherable. Fortunately, I watched the DVD version, which has an option that puts subtitles on the screen whenever Mt. Pitt speaks. The video edition does not have this feature, but that doesn't matter too much. His dazzling performance is entirely physical in nature, so what does it matter what he has to say? The other characters don't understand him either.
The movie was directed by Michael Ritchie, who is probably better known to Americans as Madonna's husband. His first picture, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, was also about psycho bad guys; in fact, Snatch is so similar to it that it is practically a sequel. The characters are different, but many of the same actors appear in both movies. Both films also share Ritchie's frenetic, stylish editing, as well as his fascination with lowlifes.
The plot is so complicated that describing it is difficult. I had little problem following it, but several reviewers admitted to getting completely lost. Basically, the story is about a huge diamond that gets stolen from a jewelry company in Amsterdam. It bounces from one group of criminals to the next, and, of course, everybody wants to get their hands on it at any cost. Meanwhile, a boxing promoter is having a very difficult time with a vile, ruthless gang boss who is demanding that he fix a fight. This is where Brad Pitt's character, One Punch Mickey, comes in. He is part of a band of gypsies [thus, the accent] who are the trickiest double-dealing folks you are every likely to see. Soon, everyone is merrily out to get everyone else.
The characters all have names straight out of a Damon Runyon story - Frankie Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth, Boris the Blade, Turkish and Brick Top are some of them. I think the names alone are enough of a clue that the movie is not to be taken seriously. One problem some viewers will have with it is that there are two or three times as many characters than in most movies. Keeping up with them can be a challenge.
Snatch should prove to be great fun for those who love for a movie to be fast and innovative. For those who like them to be cool, calm and collected, another choice of movies is recommended.",1016150400,2,2585,4.658643326039387
1302145,5,B00003CXS4,"Snatch is a hip comedy/heist movie that, while lacking any ""serious"" themes, is simply irresistable. Guy Ritchie [brings] the viewer in with his edgy camerawork and disjointed storyline. All of the performers are excellent, and their thoroughly memorable characters really come to life. Even the ""evil"" thug boss Brick Top is a likeable character.
It is an excellently crafted movie, and the sheer force and energy this movie conveys more than compensates for its lack of substance. Its the perfect movie for the intellectual who, jaded from seeing Requiem For A Dream, needs a light-hearted pick-me-up that doesn't insult your intelligence.",1015545600,,641,5.356435643564357
1302146,5,B00003CXS4,"The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off after about twenty minutes. I just couldn't get into at all for some reason. I was laying on the couch with my girl (my ex- now), who fell asleep after about fifteen minutes, and, for some reason, I could not see where the appeal was in this movie. I really didn't think I'd even bother trying to watch it again. Well, the next night my girl went home early, so me an' my homeboy bought a couple 18 cases'a beer an' ordered a pizza and decided just for the hell of it to pop in the movie.  I started it back at the beginning and we sat there, seeing if we could not only comprehend, but enjoy the film.  Well, I don't know if it was the alcohol, but when the movie was finished, I sat there in awe at what I had just seen, which was what I perceived as one of the best films in the past decade of cinema. I may be overstating it a little, but there's jus' sumpin' really alluring here that I'm not sure how to describe.

Unlike many viewers I've read here, I never once felt compelled to watch it with the sub-titles on, even if I didn't really understand some things. Instead, I was compelled to watch it over and over again to catch it all (I watched it twice in that first night and then again the next day! Okay, okay, I was unemployed at the time, but STILL). The story involves diamonds an' underground bare-knuckle boxing and different gangs of underworld characters with seemingly-irrelevant sub plots that all intertwine into one single WEIRD-ARSE story. The brilliant ensemble cast really bring the material to life. Even in his surprisingly small role, Benicio del Toro as Frankie Four Fingers, the high-profile thief who steals the diamond and has it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, turns in a unique, great performance. But is' definitely Pitt who steals the show though as ""One Punch Mickey"", an Irish Gypsy who becomes a pawn for two shady promoters who are in hock to a crime czar. Pitt is probably the most incomprehensible character in the entire movie, too. I mean, most of the time you really cannot understand a DAMN thing he is saying, but it makes it all the more fun.

The ending of this film will definitely trip you out, and I encourage repeat viewings from everyone who watches this movie. Guy Ritchie is turning out to be a very interesting director who I'm going to have to keep my eye on and see how his other projects turn out. I haven't seen 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' yet, and, from what I gather reading other reviews, it is very similar to 'Snatch'. I guess some people would view that as a good thing and some would view that as a bad thing. Don't worry, I ain't gonna form an opinion until I see it, but, any movie that is as smart, and well-executed as this one is sure to be a favorite of mine. I enjoyed this movie even more than I enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' if you wanna know how good I think it is, and I'm also downright ashamed that I didn't feel it the first time around. So, to all new viewers, when you watch it, don't be too quick to judge, because it may take a little bit to pull you in. But once it does, youse in for a real treat.",1015286400,5,3150,4.280201342281879
1302147,4,B00003CXS4,"With the recent glut of similar cockney gangster movies that followed in the wake of 'Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels', Guy Ritchie is back to prove that he really is the master of this genre.  Okay so the plot involving a diamond heist and a boxing ring may not exactly be world-class but it's milked for all it's worth with several fantastic characters.  Maybe it's Ritchie's management of an ensemble cast that should really be applauded here.
'Snatch' is obviously geared more towards the American market than his previous movie, with the addition of Brad Pitt and a relatively small role for Benicio Del Toro.  The rest of the cast consists of various British actors, and there's even an appearance from jungle artist Goldie.  However, it is Brad Pitt that really steals the film in his best performance to date as an incomprehensible Irish gypsy.  Of course Vinnie Jones pops up again in yet another of his stereotypical roles, but he's still very funny so who's complaining?  It's depiction of hard gangsters and wannabe gangsters also fits in surprisingly well with the movie's artier tendences.  For instance, slow motion is used to great effect and the camera work for the fight scenes is genuinely inspired.
Finally though, 'Snatch' is absolutely hilarious with its quickfire conversation that doesn't patronise its audience.  Ritchie sure doesn't pull any punches.",1015027200,15,1379,5.044052863436123

Loaded with extras, including a very amusing detailing of Guy Ritche's system of ""fining"" the cast and crew for various infractions during filming.

1302232,5,B00003CXS4,"This movie is a Guy Ritchie masterpiece that shows of hiw new age still of directing.  He is the director to follow for the next few years to come.
This movie incorporates the lately popular still of movie making which is to have one main goal or plot, and then numerous sub plots and stories that all center around the main point in this case the diamond.  This is a well done film and leaves nothing to be desired.  The use of talent in this movie is also something that makes it what it is.
The action is non-stop and the transition between scene is something really to admire about this film.  The movie always keeps you inticed to know whats going to happen next from beginning to end.  The DVD sound quality is good enough to please anybody, even those audiophiles.  The picture, visuals and cinematics are stunning and extremely pleasing.
The extras I cannot comment on because I have not yet watched through them, but I am sure there great.  If not the movie was awsome and definitely worth buying, or renting if you are not a collector.",1013126400,,1045,4.468421052631579
1302233,5,B00003CXS4,"From beginning to end, this movie is incredible.  The characters all fit together so perfectly.  I saw this in the theatre without any preconceived expectations and was extremely happy with the experience.  So much so that I went back and saw it two more times.
Recently, I have purchased this movie on DVD and have already viewed it a couple of times.  It's definately in my top ten of all-time.
Each character in Snatch is funny in their own right.  Like Tarantino films, you find yourself laughing when maybe you shouldn't be.  However, there are plenty of times you should laugh in this movie.  It's hilarious.  This is modern film making at it's finest.
My favorite line in the whole movie is when Tyrone says, ""It was a funny angle.""  The accents in the movie are great.  In the beginning, it took me a while to get use to the dialect, but now that I've seen it several times I have no trouble at all.  Well, maybe I still need to work a little on Pitt's ""pikey"" accent.  It will take most people a while to get the hang of it.
Guy Ritchie did it all here.  I have since seen ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and enjoy it as well.  If I had to take one with me, I guess this would be the one.  It just has a bit more.  The irony is the main aspect in ""Snatch,"" just as it was in ""Lock Stock.""  I feel that the characters made this a better film of the two.
I'm guessing that most people will like this film.  Give it a shot if you haven't.  If you do rent it or buy it and don't fully get it the first time, give it another go.  There are so many things going on in this movie that you need to see it a couple of times to pick them all up.",1012089600,3,1651,4.068322981366459

The movie revolves around an 84kt diamond and underground, unlicensed boxing. Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham all do wonderful jobs in portraying these charaters. Fans of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Pulp Fiction will absolutely love this film.",1011312000,,609,4.700934579439252
1302235,4,B00003CXS4,"The general haplessness and incompetence of the various criminal elements and their grandiose schemes and their confounding in this film put me strongly in mind of Donald Westlake's novels of thief Dortmunder and his buddies (""Bank Shot"", ""Don't Ask"").  Not the movies made from them, which have never quite displayed this level of precision and deftness, but the books themselves.
This is the type of film that can look so easy to just sort of toss off, but is actually quite difficult as one works to get the different story elements to work out at the right times to mesh to convey the story.
Vinnie Jones, as has been mentioned quite a bit, is a treasure; his ""replica/Desert Eagle"" scene, a sort of ""elder statesman of mayhem"" monolog, is one of the better menace bits i've seen in a while, as well as a helpful lecture on the basic mechanics of their chosen profession to a couple of junior thugs.
Dennis Farina and Brad Pitt, presumably chosen to give ""Snatch"" a bit more USAn appeal than ""Lock Stock etc""'s all UKan cast, fit in nicely with the home-grown thugs; and, of course, Pitt's total incomprehensibility to everyone (Thank the DVD Deities for the special ""Pikey"" subtitles) is used to the fullest effect.
The mayhem herein is a bit less random and coincidental than was the case in ""Lock Stock etc"", in that almost everyone has a Plan revolving either around illegal boxing matches or the 86-carat diamond or both. Some of them are quite Clever Plans.  The various story lines are a bit better explicated and easier to follow, as well.
Unfortunately for these fellows, it is a military truism that even the best battle plan seldom survives first contact with the enemy.
Impressively, unlike ""The Big Sleep"", which got so complicated that even the author of the original book was unable to figure out who killed the chauffeur, all is resolved by the end of the film, and we know what happened to whom.
OTOH, the end of the film also indicates a continuation of the screwball action...",1010966400,2,1999,4.724928366762177

Benecio Del Toro as a small part, but he is important to the story. Ilike how every time they tell him not to gamble, it shows him with a cigar and cards and Elvis singin Viva Las Vegas. Tommy is just the goofy side-kick. But my favorite person in the movie would have to be Boris ""The Bullet Dodger."" Why do they call him the bullet dodger?

1302324,4,B00003CXS4,"Folowing on from the very enjoyable and original low budget Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, this could almost be considered Lock, Stock part II as it reunites most of the cast and crew and it's another gangster movie set in London. However, although the stories are similar there are enough differences and new twists to allow this movie to be considered as a good and original movie in its own right.
Snatch starts with some jocular credits, and the robbery of an Antwerp diamond merchant's office by four thieves disguised as Hasidic Jews. Initially appear in black and white on a succession of CCTV screens, then when they reach their target, they're in colour as they grab the guns concealed on the chest of their leader. Seizing an 86-carat, size of your fist, diamond the robbers head to London to sell the stone and of course this is where the fun starts as all types of cockney and foreign misfits then become involved in the theft and counter-theft and attempted sale of said diamond.
Among the colourful array of characters on parade this time are jewish jewellers (Mike Reid and Dennis Farina), cockney hardman Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), a truly disgusting underground fight promoter by the unlikely name of Brick Top (Alan Ford), a Russian hitman - Boris the blade (Rade Serbedzija), a fight manager - Turkish (Jason Statham), and Irish traveller Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Ultimately the surprisingly excellent Brad Pitt steals the movie as the boxing `yardy' nobody can understand but veteran British actor Alan Ford as the disgusting `Brick Top' runs him close for best performance kudos.
Like its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch is full of twists and turns and plenty of black humour but unlike its predecessor it's a bit more violent and the language is even stronger. It will probably still be unfairly compared to Tarantino but its still a clever and fun movie. My only criticism of Guy Ritchie would be that he needs to learn that less is sometimes more; the movie doesn't need as many twists and it doesn't need so many alternative showy camera angles and film styles. Don't get me wrong, they're good, just a couple too many. This is a four star movie that could have been five.
Pretty much the whole world knows Guy Ritchie's name now. Sadly most people rather insultingly and condescendingly know him as Mr Madonna but just like her first husband cruelly christened Mr Madonna, Sean Penn, Guy Ritchie is a great talent in his own right. However, the acid test of Guy Ritchie's talent will come with his next movie starring `er indoors (as they say in cockney vernacular), the so far allergic to anything resembling believable acting Madonna. If he can get a decent performance out of Mrs Ritchie he truly will be hailed as a genius.",1010620800,2,2791,4.8045738045738045

About one week ago, I bought the DVD for all the extras.  The VHS is wonderful, but the DVD is even better.  On DVD, you have behind the scenes (with the actors and special effects), deleted scenes, pictures, filmographies, comments.. just great stuff, especially if you like the movie.  The only thing I would change about it is the fact that it didn't show enough Benicio del Toro.  But that's my opinion.  The movie is still completely AWESOME and everyone should go buy it now, its worth it.

The plot is essentially several layers of subplots that are intertwined, all culminating in the search for an 84 carat diamond. Most of it takes place in England, and thus there are some thick accents. There is a lot of profanity, almost every scene has at least one cuss word. There is also a lot of blood. Everywhere. Coming out of people's mouths, eyes, on the floor, on the ground, anywhere. Do not see this movie if such things offend you, because you will be offended like never before. However, it is a very good movie. Really. It has several memorable moments, a lot of black humor, and a lot of bodies. While there were a lot of characters, and most of their time in the movie is markedly brief, the coolest character is mickey, a ""Piker"", or gypsy, played by Brad Pitt. He is the very definition of badass. Perfect muscles, tatoos everywhere, and he can knock the living...out of anyone in a barefisted boxing fight.

1302329,5,B00003CXS4,"So, the follow up to 'Lock, Stock' and the general consensus seems to be that it's been rubbished by the US. Come on, the Brits don't often make a quality cult film like this! This was a good follow-up and the action flowed a little better with the dialogue being slightly sharper. Vinnie Jones, though having a small role is excellent. Whilst being similar to Big Chris in 'Lock, Stock', the character is a tiny bit softer and funnier. Jason Statham is excellent as the cool-headed Turkish, backed by the funny Tommy. Remarks that audiences couldn't understand the accents so the film failed itself, are unfair. The majority of films on the market are American and we have to deal with the huge range of accents. The director has made a huge effort to keep the accents and settings authentic e.g. Brad Pitt went on location with some gypsies to get his accent right (backed up by Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham). Perhaps what this film does best is to point out that not all Brits sound posh!!! This is a good cult film on this side of the Atlantic and Guy Ritchie is set for big things.

Snatch is not a follow up but a film featuring similar elements. It is set in an English underworld of illegal boxing matches hit men and Jewel Heists.
The film is in reality a comedy but it is a violent one. It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond. Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches.

The Brad Pitt character is really funny. I love the way he talks, sometimes I understood him and sometimes I didn't, no matter how many times I listened to him. The aggressive style in which Ritchie directs is fun to watch and the cool dialouge and plot scenarios make it a movie worthwhile to see.

1302332,5,B00003CXS4,"Personally, I'm not a film fan. I mean, I can watch a good film and enjoy it, but even some of the better ones won't have me rushing to watch them more than once or twice. I never buy films, just rent them or record them off the TV. It's simply not something that concerns me - once you've seen it and you know what's coming then where's the surprise? Why waste your cash?
Not Snatch. Snatch is a film that I can watch over and over. I watched the intro alone 5 times in one morning. I simply cannot say enough good things about this film. The only other film that compares is Braveheart (although where Braveheart is simple yet highly effective Hollywood film, Snatch is the opposite - gritty, complex, British and full of black humour). This isn't even a comedy, yet I found myself laughing more than I ever did when I watched Scary Movie, Meet The Parents or any other naff cliche you can think of. Not that this is a cheap laugh. It also has times where you near on cry - they're that powerful. Sometimes its simply all out war, with gans blasting and boxers fighting. The music is also slick - the Russian acoustic guitars tickle my ribbs, while the fight music goes through my head every day (and I listen to metal f'crying out loud!).
The characters Sol, Vinny and Tyrone are also some of the funniest in the film (""Never underestimate the predictablity of stupidity"") while Brad Pitt is hilarious as the ""sweet-talking tattoo-sporting pikey"" (to some extent he steels the show). Mike Reid doesn't once make you think of Eastenders and Benicio Del Toro is as cool as ice. Vinnie Jones is his usual snarling self but its the grim reaper Brick Top that is the scariest character in the film.
Many people know Guy Richie from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but as good as that film is, it doesn't have the sheer revisitablity of this masterpiece. The comparisons to Lock Stock are justified, true, but what does that matter when the delivery is this good? Warning though, the humour is very English, as are the references and dialect - although with the amount of good comments coming from American's as well it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.

Snatch is in no way whatsoever formulatic, sure many compare it to its prequel of sorts ""Lock Stock.."" but they are both in the same vein and tell a continuing story. But back to Snatch. I rarely give out 5 stars, yet this movie deserves it. The story moves at a quick pace and is very unpredicitable. Along the way, we are given stellar performances by Brad Pitt (not just a pretty face, the man can act. see this, se7en, fight club, etc.), Denis Farina (hilarious in the little screen time he had), Rade Sherbedgia as Boris the Blade (who also provides many hilarious moments), and Alan Ford as a kingpin who has a rather...unusual way of disposing of his victims (oink oink). The movie is billed as an action flick, which it has a lot of, but it could just as easily be billed as a comedy. The dialouge is witty and realistic, and once again the characters are vibrant and played extremely well by this ensamble. The only small problem I had with the movie at first was the heavy british accent nearly everyone uses (the movie is set almost entirely in London), which can take some getting used to, but do NOT let that dissuade you from seeing this movie.

1302427,5,B00003CXS4,"that are superb and enjoyable without knowing exactly what is going to happen in the first 3 minutes of the film .....
Ok .. there is one thing that may detract from this movie, and may be a reason for some people to review it negatively, and that is that you must be quiet and pay attention to the film. Oh my goodness thats almost blasphemy today in a world of very very light intellectual fare .....
The character study and writing is absolutely fabulous and so well balanced that all the actors absolutely shine and are able to present challenging roles perfect to character. That the director, Guy Ritchie, cast Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy with a dialect that only his band and his mother would understand took courage, and thats what makes this film exceptional. I mean all
you have to do is watch 'Enemy at the Gates' and listen to the stupidest accents of the Russians and the Germans to know what a 'sell out' directs work looks like ... total poop .... Anybody who has ever met a gypsie knows that they have their own 'for all intents and porposes' language that they only understand...
That then is the juice of 'Snatch' in that the other characters all make bets and buy things from the gypsies without really knowing what they are buying or betting on, and, they are too embarrased to ask ... Meanwhile, the gypsies don't take any notice, since they understand everyone perfectly, and just wonder why everyone around them is so stupid and practiccally begging to be taken advantage of ....
Tyrone, played by Ade, the getaway driver that is bigger than the car and can't drive was so hllarious I could barely get off the floor laughing ....
On the technical side the disc has been flawlessly produced and has been cut as a dual-layer-disc allowing the viewer to see this film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:85:1 ...

One of my favorite scenes is when they are all dressed as Rabbis and go in and rob the Jewl store, the filming is cool and different. The down to this movie is the fast moving plot. I had to see it twice to get it fully but then I had a ""oh ya I get it"" type of reaction.
When I ask my friends If they have scene it they say ""oh that movie with Brad Pitt ya it was okay."" Brad Pitt (although he is in it) plays a CO starring role. Some of the larger roles are givven to Vinnie Jones and Jason Stathem. Despite the fastness of the plot Snatch is definatly worth a shot at seeing. See it agian if you don't get it.

1302516,4,B00003CXS4,"When Guy Ritchie (more famous for being married to Madonna than a filmaker)made Lock, Stock in 1998 he left us wanting more of Guy's unique story-telling and original talent.""Snatch"" is more of the same and not much more. With lines like, ""I thought you said he was a getaway driver. What the fu** can he get away from?"" And ""You know, London...fish and chips, cup o' tea, bad food, worse weather, Mary fu**in' Poppins...London,"" make it an absolute CLASSIC of a film. Not to mention a great cast including Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Mike Reid, Dennis Farina & Jason Statham. A great story, comedy and brutal violence.
The story follows ""Franky Four Fingers"" (Benicio Del Toro) who steals a diamond with 3 other goons in Antwerp. Franky visits dodgy ex-KGB Russian, ""Boris The Blade"" (Rade Sherbedgia)to buy a guy. Franky buys one, but in return Boris asks for him to place a bet at a bookies instead of cash. So he does.
 Boris then pays a visit to 2 small-time pawnbrokers , ""Sol"" & ""Vinny"" to hold-up the bookies and rob Franky's diamond for 50 grand's work. Sol & Vinny get ""Tyrone"" their getaway driver involved.
 Sol & gang rob the bookies and get away with Frank and his diamond (the diamond's in a case attached to Franky's arm).
 ""Tommy"" (Stephen Graham) & ""Turkish"" (Jason Statham) are partners in the world in boxing promoters. Tommy & Gorgeous George(friend and tough guy) visit some ""Pikeys"" (Irish gypsies) to buy a caravan for an office. The Pikeys are lead by ""One Punch Mikey"" (Brad Pitt).The caravan's wheels fall off, the Pikeys refuse to give them their money back, but instead Mickey challenges George for a fight to decide who gets the caravan. Mickey surprisingly beats George with one punch and puts him in a critical state. It turns out Mickey is a bare-knuckle boxing champion. This leaves Tommy & Turkish with no fighter, they decide to use Mickey, but will ""Brick Top"", their boss mind?
 Brick Top runs an illegal bookies (yes, the one that Sol & gang robbed).Brick Top uses Mickey but states clearly that he has to get knocked out in the 4th round. Bric Top sets out to find out who robbed his bookies.
 Everything gets complicated after this, ""Avi"" & ""Doug The Head"" who are cousins, and friends of Franky set out to look for him after he doesn't show up for a meeting. They get they help of ""Bullet Tooth Tony"" (Vinnie Jones) to help.
 This film is truely entertaing. Not as original as Lock, Stock but still a winner. I think film critics didn't give this good reviews because it doesn't live up to the expectations of Lock, Stock.

One of my only gripes is I was disappointed with Benicio Del Toro's small amount of screen time. The commercials and reviews give the impression that he's one of the leading characters. Brad Pitt was funnier than I was expecting; his portrayal of Mickey seemed very accurate. Turkish's wry narration kept me chuckling throughout, and the introduction of Bullet Tooth Tony towards the end made up for Del Toro's small screen time.
All in all, very entertaining quality film. What pleased me the most was the lack of romantic sub-plot, which is now becoming almost a strict formula in films. I thought the plot moved nicely, with an appropriate ending.",1001635200,,838,4.786206896551724
1302521,5,B00003CXS4,"I've never seen such an eclectic group of actors, as well as characters, that worked so well together.  Snatch brings together Hollywood major-leaguers Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and Dennis Farina and throws them into an off the wall British comedy with hilarious results.
Loosely, Snatch is about a diamond heist, gone horribly wrong.
Frankie Four Fingers (Del Toro) and friends pose as Hasidic Jews to steal an 84 carat diamond in Antwerp.  The plan is for Frankie to take the diamond back to New York (via a stopover in London) and give it to Avi (Farina).
However, he is waylaid in London by Boris the Blade, whom he goes to for a gun. Boris is tipped off by one of Frankie's collaborators (who just happens to be Boris's brother) about the stone, and about Frankie's gambling addiction (how do you think he came to be minus a finger ?).  Boris devises a plan to get the diamond for himself.
Enter a slew of characters that are as hilarious as they are diverse:
Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee), petty thieves running a not-entirely-reputable pawn shop, and their oversized getaway driver (""What the hell can he get away from ?"" Vinnie asks Sol at one point) Tyrone (newcomer Ade);  Brick Top (Alan Ford),  a vicious modern day gangster that arranges (and rigs) all kinds of illegal fights (of both the animal and human variety);  and last but certainly not least Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephan Graham), partners (but not the kind that ""hold hands and take windy walks,"" as Turkish puts it) in running an illegal bare-knuckle boxing ring.
What follows is so fast-paced and intertwined that it is hard to describe it. [....] I loved this movie so much that I find it hard to keep it to a minimum when discussing it.  I haven't yet found a review that truly did it justice, and I'm sure I'm not doing much better.

As for the Special Edition, well some of the deleted scenes are huge (that is to say, just outright funny as hell) -- however, I can never understand why they (the manufacturers) don't use double sided DVDs and save us a little green. This DVD has the WIDE and the STANDARD view on on side -- why not put the bonus footage on the other side of the disc instead of having a second disc.

Thanks to DVD you can catch the dialogue in the subtitles and I guess that's what went wrong for this movie as the theatre audience felt a little helpless trying to understand the dialogue.
Guy Ritchie in his latest offering gives us something which is a cross between ""Lock Stock and 2 Smoking barrels"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".
The story involves Diamonds and underground bare-knuckle boxing and different gangs of underworld characters with interesting sub plots all intertwining into 1 single story. Snatch is a bit more riveting and also a lot more violent than LS2SB. Giving away the story would be a crime as half the fun in the movie is in the process of discovery and the element of surprise (sometimes shock !!!).Guy Ritchie handles the camerawork brilliantly and the actors playing their parts are well chosen. Jason Statham and Vinny Jones return along with some big stars like Dennis Farina, Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro. Overall a smart and witty film which inspite of the amazing complexity and the frequent jumping back and forth in time does not confuse the viewer.

Brad Pitt in all the scenes.

Ritchie's maybe employing the same formula and some may argue ""Snatch"" offers nothing new, but same can be said for certain George Lucas and his original Star Wars trilogy, or F.F. Coppola's Godfather epic. My answer is the same for all: ""Why change something that works?"" At least until it becomes a boring routine, which this is not (yet).
The story involves fixing illegal boxing matches, diamond heist and sumggling and then it gets complicated (in a goody good way).
Characters are so comic (in both meaning of the word), dialogues sharp and funny and directing is stylish and fast-paced.

1302647,5,B00003CXS4,"It would be very easy to call Guy Ritchie the English Quentin Tarantino. The two directors have a great deal in common as filmmakers. They differ in one major fashion: Tarantino likes to wallow in Americana in his films, while there is no similar celebration of English culture in Ritchie's films. Ritchie also tends to be far more kinetic in his use of the camera, using a lot of jump cutting, shots with unexpectedly harsh lighting, and some almost surreal insert shots. If Quentin Tarantino were English and had watched RUN LOLA RUN twenty or thirty times, the result might be a film that very closely resembles this one.
The cast, many of whom are either well known in general or known from Ritchie's other hit film, LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, is absolutely first rate. One of the great virtues of the film is that despite having a large cast and a devilishly complex plot, one rarely gets genuinely confused about the interrelationships among the various characters.
The one actor who especially impressed me was Brad Pitt. In my opinion, there are two Brad Pitts. The better known is a mildly entertaining but mainly boring romantic leading man. Star of such dull flicks as MEET JOE BLACK and LEGENDS OF THE FALL. The other Brad Pitt is one of the most effective character actors in Hollywood. We have seen this Brad Pitt before in films like THE TWELVE MONKEYS (for which he received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor) and TRUE ROMANCE. Pitt stands out in this film as a gypsy who is both an extraordinary street fighter and the speaker of his own language. Approximately 10% of what Pitt says in this movie is recognizable language; the other 90% is some form of indecipherable language. But the great thing is that it never sounds like just gibberish. Personally, I wish Pitt would never make another romantic movie--whether comedy or drama--and spend all his energies as an actor on quirky character roles. He is fairly boring as a romantic actor, but is utterly remarkable in his character roles.
Ironical casting: One of the gypsies is portrayed by Jason Flymyng, who played Frederick Pope in THE RED VIOLIN, an English Lord who obtained the title instrument from some gypsies, one of whom he later ""entertained"" in his bedroom.

I think that this movie and the movie Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, are both way ahead of their time in terms of the type of comedy, the type of camera work, the type of everything.

The DVD actually gives you the option of enabling ""Pikey"" subtitles so you can understand what Brad is saying. Brilliant!

 The acting for this movie was always on queue. The combination of old and new actors was a great mix. Del Toro, Pitt and Statham were perfect selections for the roles.
 The special edition DVD has interesting commentary with deleted scenes that should be watched just to see how the director had a difficult time to select the proper scenes.

But ""Snatch"" is worth watching (again and again and again) because of vivid, colorful characters (realized perfectly by an ensemble cast), clever, humorous dialogue and confident, stylish direction.  To be sure, ""Snatch"" owes much to Tarantino's films, but it's much more ...and stands up well on its own as a fun, entertaining film.",997056000,,483,5.17948717948718

Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) has secured himself financially by stumbling across an 84 carrot diamond as big as a man's fist.  Little does Franky know that other individuals are also interested in the diamond.  Boris the blade, an ex-Russian KGB agent has taken it upon himself to get the diamond.  A man with connections in the diamond industry in new york Cousin Avi and his British counterpart Doug the head have also taken an interest.  Then there is another plot about two unlicensed boxing promoters, Turkish and his partner Tommy that have to come up with a way to rid themselves of their slimy boss, Brick Top.  Brad Pitt enters the film as Mickey, the bare fisted gypsy boxer that is hierd by Turkish to come and fight for him.  An amazing tie of the film in the end.

1302788,4,B00003CXS4,"If you have seen Guy Ritchie's first feature, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, you know that he has a very unique and refreshing style of movie-making.  Like LS&TSB, Snatch is basically the story of several groups of bungling underworld characters whose stories intermingle in several different ways.  Without giving too much away, it basically revolves around a diamond and illegal underground boxing.
But the thing that makes this movie great is the fact the style.  Ritchie manages to take several storylines and intermingle them flawlessly.  Any other director would just confuse the audience, but Ritchie's gritty, yet stylish editing keeps you laughing AND following the story, all at once.
The characters are all funny and well-developed.  And especially look at Brad Pitt's performance, easily one of his best (and funniest).  And this, like LS&TSB is a movie you will have to see several times just to pick up on all the little nuances and dialogue you missed the previous times.
The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because as good as it is, it is not as ""fresh"" as LS&TSB.  Still, it is very highly recommended.",996710400,4,1147,4.9119170984455955
1302789,3,B00003CXS4,"Three small-time hoods (Robbie Gee, Ade, Lennie James) walk into a bar and pull guns, pointing them straight-armed and trembling at a big-time hit man (Vinnie Jones), seated. Slowly, he reaches into his shirt, pulls out a much larger, cooler looking gun than theirs, and sets it on the table. He proceeds to point out that the word &#8220;Replica&#8221; is inscribed on the sides of their guns. Switch to close-up: beads of sweat forming on the brows of the three hoods.
This is the type of methodical, tension filled yet droll scene that can be so effective in a film like this, because the outcome is unpredictable. There are no heroes. Anyone could die, on purpose or from a stray bullet--and anyone could end up with a big bag of cash in their hand, only to lose it again and subsequently be chopped up and devoured by pigs. ...
Like Ritchie's debut project, &#8220;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,&#8221; &#8220;Snatch&#8221; has enough twists and turns to choke a man-eating hog. But &#8220;Lock, Stock...&#8221; also had a charismatic character in the lead, missing in &#8220;Snatch.&#8221; Here, the character we latch to is One Punch' Mickey ONeal (Brad Pitt), who we end up wishing had some lines we could understand without translation (although a subtitle feature is available with the DVD).
 &#8220;Snatch&#8221; is a fast-paced, clever film with some definite gems. Benicio Del Toro's brief appearance as Franky Four Fingers, Jones' reprisal of his tough-guy persona as Bullet Tooth Tony, and of course Brad Pitt's mean Right Cross are all worth a second look.",996624000,,1579,5.026717557251908

Ritchie's first film invloved a few brits in deep trouble with a dodgy hustler, and in this film...a pair of brits in deep trouble with a crooked boxing promoter. Add a jewel thief with a penchant for gambling, several small time crooks with the worst luck, a rich american who tolerates his hate of London in search for the diamond, a dodgy russian with seemingly matrix-like ability, a hitman who is dragged along for the ride, and a very mysterious gypsy who is hired to fight for the two brits in trouble after he knocks their prized fighter senseless.
And then watch their delicate wishes get thrown into chaos.
However enjoyable this movie is, in comparison with Ritchie's first effort, there isn't a whole lot of new material to fairly distinguish this movie into a class of its own. But, based on cast and execution, it almost doesn't seem to matter.",996364800,,1039,4.6521739130434785

1302867,4,B00003CXS4,"Some say that Snatch is a poor follow up of Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  I say that this is an improvement on his signature style, an aggressive and a supercharged 21-gun salute to Britain film/filmmakers. The deftness displayed in this writer/director's pacing and editing is at times electrifying and sometimes simply beautiful. The soundtrack is not only superb and includes one of my personal favorite bands, Oasis, and is used to great comic effect as an poignant accompaniment to certain scenes.
A more violent film you aren't likely to see this year. In the vein of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, and Fight Club, Snatch is a gritty dance with the criminal element, revolving around a stolen 86-karat diamond that any good crook would give  his right arm for. (And in one case, I mean that literally.)
After a boggling series of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and multi-crosses,  Snatch becomes a game of who will end up with the gem -- and how will they get it? Ritchie keeps us guessing at every turn, with Russians hiring mercenary crooks to steal the jewel, hit men sent to kill the mercenaries, mobsters trying to outwit the hit men, Jewish jewelers scheming to undermine the mobsters, a crazed bare-knuckled boxer looking for his payday despite the chaos, and one dog who's lost his bark.
And every one of these stories is hilarious.
Vinnie Jones (Gone in 60 Seconds) as Bullet Tooth Tony, a hunter/assassin who chills his  prey with deadly stares; Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) is caught-in-the-middle robber/gambling addict; Dennis Farina, a stressed jeweler who can never catch a break; or any of two dozen other apt actors who fully own their roles. In the end, though, you have to give a hand to Brad Pitt, still buff from Fight Club, as a slur-mouthed Gypsy boxer who always manages to get one step ahead of the crowd.
Guy runs through the entire pantheon of MTV camera tricks: slow motion, fast motion,  stop motion, reverse motion, low angles, high angles, upside down camerawork, and more.
There are some funny lines, and some of the violence is quite inventive. Several times in this movie I was reminded of the ""strange occurrences"" theme seen in Magnolia. All in all this film I wholeheartedly recommend.",996019200,,2255,4.923684210526316

But my worries were all for nothing. Snatch is an incredible movie. A great plot, amazing characters, and spectacular performances make this one of the best films I've ever seen. Brad Pitt, Rade Sherbadgia, Jason Statham, and Alan Ford give the four best performances as the almost intelligible gypsy bare knuckle boxer Mickey, the crooked Russian gun salesman Boris the Blade, boxing promoter Turkish, and ruthless gangster Brick Top, respectively. And the characters of Vinny, Sol, and Tyrone (the actors names fail me at the moment) will have you laughing constantly.

Brad Pitt is a bare-knuckle Gypsy boxing champ who apparently speaks a hybrid Welsh-English, but in a funny and completely indecipherable dialect.
In fact, the entire film needs the optional English subtitles, but I think that's intentional.  The point of the movie is that it's all about the comic-book images and the sounds -- not words.

If you are unfamiliar with british accents and their slang, you will DEFINATELY need to watch it multiple times.  Guy Ritchie has the habit of making things jump around unexpectantly, and you could possibly miss something.  If you watched Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, you know what you're getting yourself into, mind you though, that while may of the same actors are in both movies, they don't play they same characters.  This is a funny, chaotic film that will keep you locked onto the screen.

1303002,4,B00003CXS4,"I enjoyed this movie. But it didn't have the charm of Ritchie's first film, ""Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels"".
This movie's got some strong points. It's funny, well shot and fantastically edited. One of the film's running gags is the difficulty in understanding certain characters. Which brings me to my strongest complaint about the film. If you don't have an ear for accents, good luck understanding ANYONE in this movie. It gets frustrating at points. I had to see the movie twice just to get straight what everybody said to each other.
There are a lot of similarities between this film and ""Lock, Stock..."". But the first one had more of an appeal, because it was about long-time friends getting themselves in a mess of trouble. It makes it easier to identify with the characters. We've all got friends who get us in tight spots, and that's why ""Lock, Stock...."" is more fun to watch and more engaging.
I would say that if you're a big fan of ""Lock, Stock...."" and Ritchie's style, get this. I did and I don't feel cheated. But this film does have some marks against it. This isn't a buy everyone should make.",995587200,,1115,4.608040201005025

Think of Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail (except remove the slapstick and insert London gangsters) and you'll have the right idea.  Even though everything hangs together, each scene is enjoyable by itself.  You could start this movie at almost any point and just start laughing your head off.
What amused me most about ""Snatch"" was Guy Ritchie's use of incredibly brief flashbacks and cut scenes as a means of characterization.  Franky ""Four Fingers"", a gangster who also happens to be a compulsive gambler, is a perfect example.  Every time somebody mentions gambling around Franky, we a treated to a quick scene of Franky's eyes glazing over, followed by pictures of him ridiculously drunk in a Las Vegas casino all set to the tune of ""Viva Las Vegas"".  Very funny!  As always Brad Pitt is hilarious.  You should defiantly check this movie out.",995500800,,1019,4.877906976744186

1303005,5,B00003CXS4,"Movie Summary: Turkish and Tommy are two likable small time wanna be gangsters. They live in England and run a few money making scams including bare knuckle boxing and slot machines. We follow their adventures as they try to stay out from under the thumb of Brick Top a gangster higher up on the food chain. From there things get more complicated and more fun as we are introduced to a myriad of characters most of which are trying to get their hands on a giant stolen diamond.
My Opinion:  I was very pleasantly surprised with Snatch. I really had no expectations and ending up liking it a lot. There was tons of action and that was great. It was quite violent, but the violence was part of the story and not thrown in as an after thought. There is a slightly complicated plot that holds the entire movie together and that was great as well. There were a lot of very interesting characters and you guessed it, they were great! I could see how someone could get confused by the plot or the large number of characters, but with a little bit of attention you can do it. Everything just fit together so well that I was amazed. I haven't seen Ritchie's other movie Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, so I can't comment or complain about the similarities but I can't imagine complaining no matter how similar they are. In fact if they really are similar then I've got another great movie to look forward to. Brad Pit is incredible as the fighting Piker. I really wasn't a fan of his before this and really didn't want to be, but I'm definitely leaning that way now.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 as well as full screen. DD 5.1. Both picture and sound quality are great. This is a two disc set with the second disc containing tons of extras including trailers, Making Of feature, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.
What You Should Do:  See Snatch. It is a violent complicated fun movie that deserves a look. If you are a big fan of Lock Stock then you are probably going to want to own this full featured DVD.

1303006,4,B00003CXS4,"I'm an avid moviegoer, and usually, I like everything I see. I give movies the benefit of the doubt, even when they don't deserve them. When ""Snatch"" was released in the theaters, I knew I wanted to see it, but after rewatching it again on DVD, I knew why I loved it so much the first time. Although I haven't seen Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock..."", ""Snatch"" is one of the movies that simply carves a genre all its own. The entire collection of characters, setting, and dialogue is so believeable, yet so over-the-top, that you simply laugh when thinking about it. The English crime underworld is the main focus of the story, and Ritchie pulls it off in a satisfying crime caper gone terribly awry. Benecio Del Toro's Frankie Four-Fingers is presented hysterically in snippets of Las Vegas footage that will have you crying, and the rest of the characters, from the bumbling fools Sol and Vince to the evil Brick Top, are extremely memorable. Oh, and don't forget the dog.
If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, then Snatch should be right up your alley. Some may call it a rip off, but the story is unique on its own. The DVD's special features are pefect, and when you turn on ""Pikey Subtitles"", Brad Pitt's character is THAT much better. And the deleted scenes feature (""Stealing Stones"") while playing the movie really gives terrific insight into the director's thoughts. As does the commentary track.
Snatch is a gritty, nicely paced, comedic crime heist picture that should make its way into your DVD collection. Be warned, however: If you're turned off by sometimes indecipherable digalgue (yes, the Brits are hard to understand sometimes), then Snatch may not be one of your faves. Also, it's definitely a testosterone-driven flick, so you women may have some problems enjoying the ridiculous violence and gangster goings-on.

After hearing that he Benicio Del Toro (who I adore, see my Fear and Loathing review) were ""starring"" in Snatch, I was sucked into the theatre to see it. Up until that point, Fight Club had been my favorite movie, and now Guy Ritchie has bumped Fincher's work down a notch. Here's the good stuff: 1. The cinematography was spectacular through most of the movie, esp. the Cousin Avi/Concorde part, the Desert Eagle part, and of course the boxing scenes. 2. The soundtrack just plain worked. 3. Brad Pitt, proving once again that he is one of the most versatile actors on the screen. 4. The wheels-within-wheels plot style (which is becoming all the rage again with movies like Traffic, Lock Stock, and Go) 5. Wonderful acting by nearly everyone involved, even the minor characters. This is interesting considering that most of the cast had little to no acting experience. 6. The car scene 7. The intro Now, the few nit-picky complaints: 1. Too short. The first time you see the movie it seems 3 hours long. In reality, its only an hour and forty minutes. So much more could have been added in without slowing the movie down too much. 2. Some of the ""main"" characters don't get enough screen time, namely Doug the Head, and Frankie Four Fingers. 3. The deleted scenes on the DVD make you scratch your head wondering where Ritchie was originally going with some aspects of the plot. The Bottom Line: If you like British comedy, buy it. If you like twisted comedy, buy it. If you like Tarantino-style movies, buy it. ..., just plain buy it.",995328000,,1610,4.613240418118467
1303008,5,B00003CXS4,"This movie has been the movie all year that has impressed me the most. Guy Ritchie, in his sophomore directorial outing (the last being 1998's fantastic and critically acclaimed ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"").
The movie is different than what you're advertised though, the movie takes place in England and everybody including the American actors (except 1 or 2) have heavy heavy accents, it'll be hard for you to break down some of the dialogue so the first time you watch this watch it with subtitles on, even though i watched this on VHS on a TV with no closed captioning. It'll help you get a little more about the movie.
The movie has several plots that cross paths including betting on illegal boxing matches, the war over a diamond and mob wars. It's really confusing but it's worth sitting through, it's better than 90% of the movies we get in America. I don't want to spoil the plots so i won't get into detail.
All in all this is a big step up for Guy Ritchie and it's even better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. From the looks of this DVD (Which is a two DVD set with a whole disc of extras, yay), it looks like a must buy. Anyway, which ever route you go you need to give this movie at least one viewing for yourself. It's definitely worth at least the price of rental but i'd advise you to buy this DVD that's been put together for us.
I'm surprised that a film with such substance and great acting/directing/writing was a big hit in America, we usually like 100 million dollars of explosives and silly teen comedies meant to capitolize on the few with substance like American Pie.

There are two reasons this film works: the soundtrack and the cast. The music for this movie runs the gamut, from such bands as Massive Attack and pop icons like Madonna (hey, who's she married to again? I'm kidding.). The cast is great, with some shockingly funny performances by Brad Pitt (the subtitles for him specifically on the DVD shed some light on his dialogue), Benicio Del Toro (good for the time he's in this), Vinnie Jones (thoroughly smooth), and many, many others. There are some great scenes, inlcuding a botched heist (apparently inspired by many crimes caught on tape), a seemingly unkillable nemesis that refuses to stay dead, and a few thoroughly horrible deaths.

If you didn't like ""Lock Stock,"" then by all means, stick with the trite Hollywood excrement you know and love.  This film deserves much more praise than it's received, and most of the ""It's just like the first one"" claims are only skin-deep.  True, the style of the films is greatly similar...but the same can be said for Hitchcock, Scorsese, Spike Lee, and (especially) Tarantino.  That doesn't mean that they're not great film-makers.  It simply means that they have a distinct style...which I think is a good measuring stick for the talent of a film-maker...especially in the 21st century, when there have been so many films released that maintaining one's own style is increasingly difficult.  The plots of the two films are truly not that similar.  The only main comparison is that they both involve diverse people getting sucked into something that is beyond their comprehension...or, at the least, much bigger than they'd imagined.  In this film, there is a distinct lack of the Cockney rhyming slang which permeated its predecessor.  It is NOT a sequel.  Only a handful of the actors from ""Lock Stock"" appear in ""Snatch""...and they appear as different characters.  Brad Pitt is a welcome new addition, portraying a nearly indecipherable, omni-tattooed Irish gypsy named Mickey, who engages in some bare-knuckle boxing that is strangely reminiscent (though not particularly DERIVATIVE) of ""Fight Club.""  Benicio Del Toro also gives a brief, but fabulous, performance.  No card-playing, no antique shotguns, no madman with an afro, no former-singer-for-the-Police dad, no gratuitous beatings administered with marital aids.  This is a film unto itself, and one which deserves recognition as such.  The only thing in this film which is truly derivative of ""Lock Stock"" is the scene in which Vinnie Jones (as Bullet-Tooth Tony) is slamming some poor schmuck's head in a car door, just as he did (as Big Chris) in ""Lock Stock""...I'm certain, however, that the scene was VERY intentional, designed to get a laugh out of viewers who remembered the scene from the first film.  And it worked.  So...if you're a fan of cutting-edge British cinema, check out ""Snatch.""  And don't worry if you can't understand 60% of what Mickey says.

1303137,5,B00003CXS4,"'Snatch' is a great, great film. It is very well directed by Guy Ritchie and full of some interesting characters. From the character introduction to the 'pieces fall together' end, writer director Guy Ritchie does a wonderful job. Although we could have seen more of wonderful Benicio Del Toro, the cast was wonderful. Vinnie Jones was great as Bullet Tooth Tony, Denis Farina did a wonderful job as Cousin Avi, Rade Sherbedgia was superb as Boris the Blade, Alan Ford was VERY evil as Brick Top, and Brad Pitt was hysterical as the unforgetable One Punch Mickey. The movie made me laugh and struck several emotions all while giving a general feel of cool. Some of the more emotional scenes were Gorgeous George's knockout and the caravan burn. One of my favorite scenes of all time is the final fight where Mickey goes underwater. I can only hope that the Guy Ritchie can out-do himself in his next film.
The DVD is great, too. With a hilarious and insighting commentary track by Guy Ritchie and producer Matt Vaughn. The sound and picture are crystal clear, and the ""Making Snatch"" featurette is one of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries I've seen (a lot of work seemed to go into it). The deleted scenes and trailers from other films are an added bonus. Also, unlike Terminator 2, you don't need a DVD-ROM to check out the storyboard comparisons.

One note, this movie is definitely done by and done for the MTV generation -- very quick shots in rapid fire format, intensely quick short cuts to what can only be described as 'imagery', and occasionally nauseating camera angles.

 What I found was a movie that is simply brilliant. It is filled with some of the funniest scenes you have seen in a long time (top-notch humor, the type of Saturday Night Live, but British-style), and therefore deals in that way with a whole ganster-like plot with originally many separate threads, which are progressively combined in a very smart way, much like the maestro Tarantino would do.
 If you enjoyed ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (Richie's first movie) you'll love this one. If you haven't seen it, after you see Snatch, you'll die to see it and will love it every bit as much. Richie uses again a large part of the same cast from the first movie (including the main star, Jason Statham).
 The only thing I regretted was that Del Toro did not play a more important role in the movie. But then again, Pitt's rendition of the impossible-to-understand-yet-incredibly-funny gipsy was a sample of sheer genius!",994464000,5,1131,4.702020202020202

1303254,5,B00003CXS4,"LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS showed the new talent in the noir/comedy genre that is Guy Ritchie.  SNATCH proves that he is terrific at what he does.
SNATCH is a giddy, rollicking gangster comedy that is one of the funniest things I have ever seen hit the screen.  LOCK STOCK was very good, but Ritchie proves that he has an original visual style that works well with his films' typical fast paced styling and editing.  Ritchie's camera moves all over the place in odd spins and twists, jumpcuts, sudden speed changes, and pauses.  It's brilliant camerawork that adds to the impact of the more serious moments of the movie.
Even though it is the supporting cast that truly keeps this film chugging, every single actor is great in their part.  Benecio is quite funny in his small roll, as is Brad Pitt, who steals every single scene he is in.  But the fast paced, rapid-spit style dialog that is given by each actor is so funny that there seems to be no way anyone can screw it up.  This is a guy film all the way, even considering that the only female actress who isn't nude is Pitt's ""mother,"" who registers well in her roll.  The actors have terrific chemistry with everyone, and that makes every performance even more believable.
The story really can't be explained, since it's all over the spectrum, but it involves underground boxing, a HUGE diamond, a funny yet mean dog, and lots and lots of unsavory characters.  Ritchie's script is full of terrific one-liners and spouts of hilarious dialog, along with some very interesting takes on things such as the birth of Jesus and the meaning of the word ""Nemesis.""
One thing in great films always sticks out, making the film evern better, and in SNATCH, it's the music.  It's a great blend of pop, techno, rock, and off-beat classical.  Every character seems to have some sort of theme song that is perfectly matched with their personality.
Overall, SNATCH is great fun.  It's funny, smart, fast paced, and never bogged down in its own pomposity, as many ventures into this genre are.  Ritchie, to me, is like Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, THE WAY OF THE GUN).  He knows he is good in his genre, but it will be extremely interesting to see both of these great writer/directors as they move into unkown territory of film.",994118400,3,2289,4.661691542288557

Every time I start to wonder about why (aside from his looks) he has a career at all, I'm reminded that, to me, he was the only redeeming feature in Thelma and Louise. In Snatch he is perfection: the incomprehensible dead-on Irish blather, the banty-rooster fighting fists, the mother-loving sentiment; the entire package is just fabulous.

1303260,4,B00003CXS4,"I guess if you can only do one thing, you may as well do it really well.  I'm not saying Guy Ritchie has limited talents, mind you.  I'm sure he could write and direct a ripping-good romantic comedy or an intimate costume drama.  But he hasn't yet.
""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" (LS&2SB) has spent the last two years on my list of 'movies most recommended'.  It's a rocking tale, following an eclectic blend of lower-class British gangsters bumbling after precious loot.  ""Snatch"" can be described in basically the same way.  And you know what? I didn't mind the similarities.  Probably because Ritchie is that rare director (I dare say auteur) whose talents range from concocting convoluted but interesting stories, to writing iconoclast and stylish dialogue, to getting the best from his actors, to displaying a kinetic but controlled visual style.  And he does it all in one movie.  Let's not judge him on that forthcoming romantic comedy, because he hasn't made it yet.  He has made ""Snatch"", and it's a great film.
A plot summary would be pointless, because trying to follow the plot here is half the fun.  Time doubles back on itself repeatedly, scenarios play out one way and then are revealed to have played out another, and the audience never really knows who has the upper hand.  ""Who"" meaning an enormous (and deliciously named) cast of characters, each doing their best to get their hand on an enormous diamond.  Needless to say its all an excuse for some ridiculous action sequences, some seriously funny (rolling on the floor laughing at times) dialogue, and several temptations of fate that leave you asking the questions: ""How can these guys be so stupid?""
It's also an excuse for some seriously inventive displays of stylish virtuosity.  Ritchie employs a multitude of techniques: slow motion, quick edits, split screens, hyperactive cameras, odd angles, etc.  They never feel forced or contrived, but rather necessary.  He also pulls off some neat trickery, like filming the opening sequence entirely through the security camera monitors of a diamond shop.  Or an extended pause that studies the faces of three characters, and explains how the expression on one doesn't bode well for the baddies in pursuit.  Or the photomontage that shows Frankie Four Fingers in gambling ecstasy.  Or Cousin Avi's quickly cut Trans-Atlantic flights (which reminded me of a similar but distracting technique Darren Aronofsky utilized in ""Requiem for a Dream"").  Ritchie uses the whole palette at his disposal, and it's mighty fun to watch.  It should also be noted that, thankfully, the style never gets in the way of the actors.
Most of the acting is top notch.  Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro, and Jason Statham all bring a world-weary blend of cynicism and exhaustion to their roles.  Alan Ford and Rade Serbedzija do some top notch scenery chewing, appropriate for their malevolent characters.  Robbie Gee, Lennie James, and Ade are appealing and goofy as pawnshop owners charged with stealing the diamond.  They all combine for a fine ensemble cast, an interesting tapestry of characters.  Thank god they are all capable, because they are nearly overshadowed by two performances here that, if they had shared any screen time together, would do determined battle for the status of ""actor who steals the movie"".
Vinnie Jones essentially reprises his role from LS&2SB, a determined bounty hunter named 'Big Chris'.  Here, he's named 'Bullet Tooth Tony'.  The only real difference here is that Tony doesn't drag his son around to do jobs with him.  Jones is a cool customer, very low-key, matter-of-fact, and incredulous when things don't go exactly as planned.  Unfortunately, Tony comes to the story too late, and leaves too early.  I wished we could spend some more time with him.
Brad Pitt gets just enough screen time.  He plays a gypsy (he and his fellow ""Pikeys"" live in a trailer-park commune) boxing prodigy named 'One Punch Mickey O'Neil'.  Picture ""Fight Club's"" Tyler Durden, with an incomprehensible Irish accent (to be fair, attention and concentration will allow you to decipher just enough of Pitt's dialogue to get the gist of what he's talking about).  Here, Pitt repeatedly gets the tar beaten out of him (the boxing sequences are great fun), sports a dirty beard and greasy hair under his ever present leather hat, and appears to be having a heap of fun.  That is, until one heartbreaking scene that violently throws the movie towards its engrossing third act.
If run back-to-back, one would be hard-pressed to determine where LS&2SBs begins, and ""Snatch"" ends.  Hopefully, Ritchie will tackle some new territory with his next projects.  But for now, he does what does extremely well, and that's really all one can ask from him.  If you liked LS&2SB I can guarantee you'll like ""Snatch"" too.",992995200,2,4824,4.998746867167919
1303261,4,B00003CXS4,"I am a true believer in a strong soundtrack...If I was making a movie, a killer soundtrack would be a must.  Tarentino's movies may be ""stylish"" with ""hip"" dialogue, but its his ""ultra-hip"" nack of picking the right songs from his music vault that truely makes his movies what they are.  Same with Guy Richie... In Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, sure he had cool characters and whitty dialogue, but it was his insertion of equally cool songs that brought the movie from average to ""cutting-edge cool.""  Pete Wingfield's ""18 With a bullet"" the Castaway's ""Liar Liar"" and a collection of oddities and favorites from a variety of musical genres brought the picture to a head. In ""Snatch"" we find a movie that is peculiarly similar to Lock Stock, maybe too much so.  It has the same random characters, and the same way of bringing the different characters in different scenes back into one another.  We have the same whitty razor's edge dialogue...and the same compolation-cool-various music-genre soundtrack throughout the movie as well... Songs like Klint's Diamond fit well...but as a huge fan of both the specials and the stranglers I was really glad to see ""Ghost Town' and ""Golden Brown"" on the soundtrack... he even includes his wife Madonna's bubble-gum-teeny-bop classic ""Lucky Star"" as well.

1303352,3,B00003CXS4,"Since ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was released in 1998, British cinema has been eager to cash in on its succes with imitators. That could be one of the reasons why ""Snatch"" is such a disappointment. Its due to the fact that writer/director Guy Ritchie hasn't built on the promise he showed. Yes, his undoubted visual perfection is still there - never so clearly than by the firey opening - but don't believe the film-maker's hype that ""Snatch"" is 'completely different' to ""Lock Stock"". It isn't. But Mr. Madonna's effort is ultimatley damaged, while it also serves to harsh facts: for one, it is becoming very apparent that Ritchie's writing skills are no match for his directorial ones.!",992649600,,699,4.882352941176471
1303353,3,B00003CXS4,"SNATCH is the much anticipated ""sequel"" to director Guy Ritchie's hugely successful affair, LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS. But where the first film was fresh and original, the second seems to be more a blank copy, which is forced to exaggerate typical ""crowd-pleasures"" such as violence and ""hip"" filmmaking. SNATCH manages to create several funny moments, for sure, but for the most part the film loses itself in its own ego (it's as if Guy Ritchie is saying ""we're the coolest people around""). It's just a little too much of everything in SNATCH. But maybe I'm judging it a bit too harsh. Let's focus on the positive things... The cast is great. Brad Pitt is funny as the Irish Gypsy, One Punch' Mickey O'Neil. Dennis Farina is always good as a gangster. Benicio Del Toro has way too little screen-time. And Vinnie Jones fits the role as a tough torpedo. And there are several memorable moments and quotes in the film (Uncle Avi (talking to Bullet-Tooth Tony): ""What should I call you? Bullet? Tony?"" / Bullet-Tooth Tony: ""You can call me Susan if it makes you happy""). But I guess the point that I'm trying to get across is this: The film may deserve more credit than what I'm giving it, but because of its excellent predecessor, I couldn't help but feel all the more disappointed about this one (million dollars may be a lot of money, but not compared to a billion dollars).",991958400,,1382,4.644897959183673
1303354,4,B00003CXS4,"&#8220;Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels&#8221; reinvented the British Gangster film and gave the world a Great new director, Guy Ritchie. &#8220;Snatch&#8221; is Guy's Second film, and although it doesn't reinvent any genres, it is still one of the most Fun Gangster films Ever made.
The Story is far too complex to summarize, so I'll just jump straight into the Review. Everything that made &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; such a Success is Here in Abundance, The Oddball Characters, the Ultra-Slick Dialogue, the Over-the-top Violence, &#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Everything &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; had Except it's Freshness and Originality.
The Performances, Familiar or Fresh, are Wonderful. The Casting of Brad Pitt and the Creation of his Odd-ball Character was a Stroke of Genius. Vinnie Jones might as well have been called Chris (his character from &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;), as his Bullet-tooth Vic character here is virtually Identical to him in Every Way. Dennis Farina does his Mob guy routine again and it's as Funny as Ever. Jason Statham isn't really good enough of an Actor to Lead the film, he fit better as Bacon in &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;, the Ultra-Slick dialogue comes out of him a little Stunted, but he's Likeable enough. Benicio Del Toro is as Wonderful as Ever, his lack of Screen time downright Angers me. In the end it was Rade Serbedzija as Boris the Blade who I wanted to Win the Day. He is a Character that Cannot be Killed and an Actor who Cannot give a Bad Performance.

You can see the effort the director and stars have put in, and they deserve praise for their attitude. The story brilliantly splits itself 3 separate ways, telling stories that at the end someone match together. The script works this out nicely, making sure there aren't too many plot holes, although many scenes will confuse some audiences. The acting is good from a great esemble cast, Brad Pitt steals the show as Irish boxer Mickey. However, the camera tricks take the cake, they're as effective as the shots used in The Matrix, and the sound effects and the editing are excellently done.

1303453,5,B00003CXS4,"""Snatch"" is alot of fun!  You can't help but love the lead characters, even though they are, for the most part, just a pack of losers.  Brad Pitt is truly marvelous as the mush-mouthed gypsy (which I read was a take on Benicio Del Torro's ""The Usual Suspects"" character) and, as in ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", Vinnie Jones is a major scene stealer.  The plot twists are great and I never found myself getting bored.  While similar to ""Lock, Stock..."" in some ways, it is definately it's own film.  If you like your movies fasted paced, violent and wildly funny, then see ""Snatch"".  You will love it!",989280000,2,611,4.559633027522936
1303454,4,B00003CXS4,"Ok right off the bat I liked this movie a lot, but come on you can't say that this is just a remake of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  If you can't see the similarities, just look again cause it's pretty easy to see them.  I like how Ritchie handles this genre but I really feel that he needs to head in a new direction.  Brad Pitt has a great supporting roll and his accent is one of the best I've ever heard.  At first you think he's just mumbling, but then you realize that he's actually speaking real words.  It's amazing.",989193600,,533,4.135922330097087

Thanks to Guy, Benicio, Brad and others for this great film!",989107200,,185,3.65
1303456,5,B00003CXS4,"This film is not a sequal, its not a prequal its just supurb, all by its self! The DVD is literally packed with amazing features, i have seen the film 10 times and everytime i see it i notice something new. The music rocks, the acting is first class (brad Pitt is truely sensational.) and the story line is exciting, original and packed full of laughs. I wouldn't call it a comedy but take this film seriously at your peril!!
Finally a director/writer is showing the world what Britain is really like, we're not all Tea lovers with perfect accents!
Just a tip, when this DVD does arrive in the US, i suggest you watch it on Subtitles, Brad pit is even better when you know what he's saying!! The deleted scenes are even good. Top Film!",988934400,,735,4.372262773722627
1303457,5,B00003CXS4,First of all this movie just plain rocks.  I was laughing from start to finish.  Everything from the weapons used to the pitbull eating a squeak toy is funny.

1303458,4,B00003CXS4,"Here in Oz, we've been lucky enough to get the Snatch DVD recently. But it's worth the wait.
The commentary with Guy Ritchie and Matt Vaughn [the producer] is as erratic as the film. They're never able to stay on topic for long [the producers are giving them sheets listing things to mention], but they do fill the track with plenty of laughs. These guys have got stories.
The 'Stealing Stones' feature is like the 'White Rabbit' one from The Matrix. When the diamond comes up, press on it and you'll see a deleted scene entered into the film.
The picture disc, photo gallery, talent profiles and production notes are the standard stuff, but the way they're presented makes them far more entertaining than usual [see the little characters besides everyone in the talen profiles].
You get a 25 minute 'making of' feature, which I can guarantee will make you laugh. Witness the antics of Bo, the dog, and watch Guy handing out fines to people who stuff up. From watching this you can tell they had a blast making the movie.
6 more deleted scene w/ optional commentary. Good stuff, but you can see why it was cut.
Storyboard to film comparisons. Normally these are dull, but here they're energetic and off three different views. It actually offers moving shots rather than just stills.
The interviews are a little dissapointing, but only a little. It's mostly snippets.
Of course there's the trailers and TV spots, and even song samples from the soundtrack. Finally, another behind the scenes feature, equally as good as the other.
If you loved this movie, you have to get this DVD. You'll love it.",988329600,14,1595,4.720430107526882
1303459,5,B00003CXS4,"Guy Ritchie knows his way around a movie camera.  His last film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, handed us a bunch of guys down on their luck and out a couple of grand.  In this movie we get a group of all-star competitors all on the hunt for a diamond the size of a fist.  Brad Pitt, a bare-knuckled boxer gypsie?  Dennis Farina, a crime boss?  Benicio Del Torro, a crook with a gambling problem?  You better believe it.  And you have to see it to do so.  The editing of the film is exquisite.  Every scene you either laugh histerically or you cringe at the gruesome violence.  You have to own this one.  If you loved Lock, Stock, then you this movie is a MUST own.",988243200,2,671,4.1640625
1303569,4,B00003CXS4,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the film (any movie that drives out a group of senior citizen viewers 40 minutes into it is GOLDEN to me) but the whole time I could not shake the feeling that it was nothing but the violents bits of Lock,Stock warmed over with a darker storyline and more dumb humor.
Lock,Stock was a classic not only for the violence, the quick edits, and the vernacular, but for the intricately plotted storyline that effortlessly interwove a cast of many into one big tapestry that flowed perfectly.  Snatch seemed disjointed, almost as though the interactions were forced there, just to suit a gag later on, or merely to invent some eccentric humorous character.  Nowhere do you get the feeling that this is more than just a funny heist-gone-wrong movie, unlike Lock,Stock which was a very well-thought-out cohesive film.
Brad Pitt?  Big deal.  He barely spoke in the entire film.  Yet the theater practically erupted in paroxisms of sympathy laughter when he did.  I'm guessing people were more into the role he played than how he played it.  The movie would have been better without him (though I'm sure his presence helped the box office receipts.)  Dennis Farina (real life ex-cop) is SO genuine as the exasperated American of the caper.  Brick-Top is genuinely scary, and Vinnie Jones gets to play another smooth-talking tough guy.  The rest are either pathetic or forgettable, and that goes for the 2 leads, as well as Benicio Del Toro.
Not a wretched cash-in sequel, but definitely not the inspired work of art of Ritchie's first and superior film.  And the critics are right, as much as I liked both films, he's played the ""dumb gangster"" card twice now, but 3 strikes and you're out, old chap.
Bottom line: A violently ""in-your-face"" yet affable black-comedy missing the soul of the original.",988243200,2,1817,4.829032258064516
1303570,5,B00003CXS4,"If you were to chose 1 comedic DVD to buy this year it should be Snatch! It continues where Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels finishes althought it's funnier and more violent, not in a redundant excess like Hollywood movies.
It shows off Richie's inginuity with camera editing and storytelling and his facination with the underworld and indie films.  The cast is brilliant, you've never seen B. Pitt as a comedic hard hitting gypsie. It's worth the price of watching Pitt speak! Jason S. is excellent and you almost feel compassion for the 3 hapless black guys. Superb typecasting of Vinnie Jones, Dennis Farina, Goldie ect.
In short, it's hilarious, action packed and suspenceful but you have to understand european humour.
So Snatch it before your neighbour. On DVD region 2 it has a good extra material disc.",988156800,,810,4.869565217391305
1303571,5,B00003CXS4,"I went to the multiplex a few days ago. I saw a double feature, with this and ""3000 Miles To Graceland"", and since the movies were both about crime, I was expecting to have a ball. I loved 1 of them and disliked the other. Guess which catagory ""Snatch"" went into!
I never saw ""Lock, Stock, And 2 Smoking Barrels"", but it was highly advertised and looked like something cool. I knew that recently, Madonna married this films helmer, Guy Ritchie, so I figured he had to be artistic to be married to the most washed-up, over-the-hill case of I-have-no-career-so-I should-hide-on-a-ranch syndrome that Micheal Jackson endures. I was right
From the opening scene, which shows Oscar nominee Benicio Del Toro leading a pack of Hasidic Jews to steal a diamond, to the later boxing match, this is a work of excellent filmmaking. Ritchie wrote and directed this hilarious action-comedy, so I give him full credit for this films brilliance. Did I mention you should see it, or ze germans might see it first.
The acting is excellent. Yeah I know, every magazine/newspaper on this planet says Brad Pitt holds the film together. They are so wrong. While his performance is hilarious and inspired, the rest of the cast (Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, and Ade most significantly) is also very gifted. Without Farina's sarcastic comments, Jones's sadistic sarcasm, and Ade's struggles to exit his car, this film would probably suck.
You don't get me? Let me make it easy for you. Snatch-good. ""Graceland""-bad. Farina,Jones,Ade-funny. See now-or-me brake-you-legs. Get it? Got it? GOOD.",984009600,3,1566,5.003831417624521
1303572,5,B00003CXS4,"I have seen all of the big releases of 2001, but Snatch is absolutely one of the funniest movies I have seen a long while. Guy Ritchie the director of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has outdone himself this time. Brad Pitt is hilarious, and Jason Statham gives an award winning performance as the lead charachter Turkish. Its not a family movie, but I would absolutely recommend this movie to any of my friends or just fans of a good comedy. It was definitely a nice surprise.",983491200,8,480,4.465909090909091
1303573,5,B00003CXS4,"For years I have not bothered too much with 'movies', not liking much of the cliched hollywood drivel.  But since getting a DVD player I have also found myself going to the cinema.  What a treat to see SNATCH.  Brilliantly funny writing, superbly executed by the actors, realistic dialogue, believeable characterisations.  Fast moving, sub-plots neatly interwoven, casting brilliant, all in all superb.  I came out of the cinema having laughed myself stupid whilst at the same time having enjoyed a storyline which was both simple to follow but complex in makeup.  Guy Ritchie has done a great job on this, the cast was superbly chosen, even Brad Pitt, who, heretofore, has not been a particular favourite of mine.  I have now also bought the DVD, two disks, masses of extras, have watched it four times, cant watch again, my ribs won't stand the pummelling they take. I recommend this to all.  To our American cousins, I think it is only recently released, go and see it now, you will love it.",983059200,3,994,4.771929824561403
1303574,5,B00003CXS4,"When I heard 'that guy who stands next to Madonna all the time' was making a follow-up to his brilliant debut, I knew that I would be parting with the cost of a cinema ticket regardless of any biting reviews that may have ensued. This is partly due to the fact that being from London I have come across a few cockneys in my time (and a few Irish gypsies for that matter)which enables me to get more out the movie than one my American cousins via an enhanced understanding of not only the dialogue and accents, but of the modus operandis of cockney rebels. Hence that this over-worked genre appeals to me. Basically, this is more of the same from Guy Ritchie; Not only has many of the cast from Lock Stock remained (Jason Statham, Alan Ford, Jason Felmyng), there is also the now-familiar plot of a mixture of 'firms' coming together in a violent-but-funny farce. New additions include the generally excellent Brad Pitt who puts in a very good performance, especially by the way he has negotiated the almost unrecognisable accent of an Irish 'Pikey'. He is also well supported by not only the reliable Statham, Ford, and Flemyng, but by the spread of lesser-known actors. People who wanted a completely new offering from Ritchie should be reminded of the old ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it"" adage. On the other hand, we wouldn't die of violent comedy starvation had Ritchie's recent eloping with the said pop star mellowed him towards milder genres. I have to say that the direction of Guy Ritchie is instantly impressive. The clever visual elements are refreshingly achieved by skill and a seemingly natural feel for the job, rather than being reliant upon the special effects studios which are employed with pretty much every Holywood release these days; To me an offering by Alfred Hitchcock can be more satisfying than a Ridley Scott simply by the fact that he has achieved it with less technology. Ritchie has light years to travel before he reaches such greatness, but if he continues in the same vein and dabbles with a few more genres, he can make his mark on movie history.",982886400,,2083,4.678474114441417
1303575,5,B00003CXS4,"Can you say Snatch?  This movie is great from beginning to end, the ensemble cast including Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt is to die for!  With character names like, Frankie Four Fingers, Mickey One-Punch, and Turkish, this raw display of awesome film power thrills me to the extreme!  A must see for anyone who likes indie films!
Benicio Del Toro captures the screen as Frankie Four Fingers, the jewish theif/currier who makes stupid bets with the wrong people!  It's a great small-part Del Toro film like: The Funeral or Basquiat and a different type of Brad Pitt film, I actually enjoyed his portrayal of Mickey.  It was a good move on his part to take this role!  He should look for more like it.

I watched Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and thought it was a pretty good flick, but it didn't grab me like Fight Club.  But when I saw Snatch I was blown away.  This movie starts off slow, but then goes 0-90 in a few seconds and before you know it, it is over.  I was so disappointed when this movie was over.  I wanted more.  90% of the characters were phenominal.  The action was great, the story had no holes.  I was amazed at the depth Guy Ritchie developed for each character in such a short amount of time.  I was hyper for a couple days after seeing this movie.  I continously tried to explain the plot to everyone I knew, yet it seemed impossible to do so.  Despite that, you never get lost in the movie, it just happens so fast and so much, you cannot catch your breath.  Really a triumph in cinema.  I am completely impressed with the film and I consider myself a tough sell.  Really worth watching....  4 or 5 times.",980812800,2,1057,4.112745098039215
1303578,5,B00003CXS4,"Hey, have you heard about that guy who just married Madonna? Who knew that he also made movies! Guy Ritchie has done it again. Where ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" knocked on our hip-dialouge-driven-action-movie starved door (due in part to the 3 year absence of Mr. Tarantino), ""Snatch"" kicks open the door and comes at us with guns blazing.  Snatch revolves around a stolen ""diamond the size of a fist"" that changes hands between quite a few of London's most unsavory characters. Characters such as underground boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Stratham) and thief extrodanaire/gambling junkie Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) Others include an impossible to kill russian hitman, a ganster that feeds people to pigs, a 400 pound getaway driver, and a squeaking dog.  The story line is masterfully balanced, giving ample screen time to each and every facet of this amazing, gritty world of Ritchie. There are more than a few memorable performances, but none seem to shine like Brad Pitt as Mickey O'Niell and Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony.  Brad Pitt is hardly recognizable as a scruffy, tatooed gypsy boxer who can knock any man out with one punch. You can tell Brad leapt entirely into Mickey's skin and started running. His barely intelligible gypsy drawl is far and away the funniest running gag in th ewhole film. Pitt has given us the antithesis of what Holloywood has deemed him, no more is he to be called the sexiest man alive. He has now earned the title of the ""best damn actor we've got!""  If you haven't heard of British bad boy Vinnie Jones yet, you will now. His performance as the enforcer Bullet Tooth Tony is the breakout of the millenium. His quiet fierce intelligence burns through his gruff appearance and into each member of the audience, leaving them felling enlightened and warned all at once.  I only have 1000 words to use here, that hardly seems enough, but I can think of one word that describes this movie perfectly, ""neccessary"".  It's refreshing to have a film that entertains without insulting it's audience's intelligence. Mr. Ritchie, thank you for giving movie viewers hope of a brave and ballsy new world. In a time when the genre has faltered, it's nice to know that the hip and frantic world of bad boys who know how to use both brains and guns is alive and well and married to Madonna.",980294400,42,2340,4.77970297029703
