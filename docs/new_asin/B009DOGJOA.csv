8540389,5,B009DOGJOA,"This is my second favorite presentation by Michael.  My favorite is Fasting, and a close runner up is Sugar Oil Salt. You will learn more about how to heal and gain control of your health outcome by watching these videos.  His Blood Test DVD is not bad either, just wish that one went far far deeper than it did.  Hopefully he will do a mulit-DVD series on Blood-Tests in the future where each DVD focuses on Cardio, Diabetes, Cancer, Obesity etc.",1497916800,,447,4.493827160493828

His dietary recommendations, prevent & reverse heart disease. (Our #1 killer, in the US.)

8540393,5,B009DOGJOA,"Dr. Klapper is a really great speaker. All of his information was presented in a format that was incredibly easy to understand and really get into. I have only watched this once since I bought it but I really intend to sit down with a notebook and take some extensive notes.

Dr. Klapper has many other video's and I intend to purchase all of them. I fully expect that his other products will be as informative and as interesting as this was.",1419811200,6,442,4.390243902439025

8540396,5,B009DOGJOA,"I heard Dr Klaper in person deliver this lecture this past March 2014. It was not only filled with great info it help to clear up a lot of the myth of what and why we eat. Dr Kalper is so easy to listen to, and his good sense of humor makes it fun too! He also has a DVD called ""Digestion Made Easy"" and ""Understanding your Blood Test Results"" very handy to have if you ever have your blood drawn. GOOD STUFF, Thank you Dr Klaper for you knowledge and Compassion for all!!!!",1403913600,3,474,4.053191489361702
