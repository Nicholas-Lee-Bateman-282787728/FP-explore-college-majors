7962750,4,B000067IWX,"I expected more than just MVs. There are some bonus stuff like pics and mix song in the DVD, but that's not enough for me. The MVs are already on YOUTUBE and the it is not necessary to buy this unless you are a huge fan of Usher - I will buy it :)",1333756800,,247,3.5925925925925926
7962751,5,B000067IWX,I love usher and every thing he dose. This is the best 5 stars.,1093132800,3,63,3.5714285714285716
7962752,1,B000067IWX,Ok when i first bought this i was so excited because i'm a big Usher fan and i could not wait to see it. The bad thing about it was when i open the case and but the cd in the dvd player what came on instead of Usher was Pink (the singer). I guess whatever company that made this dvd mixed the cd up. I was to mad. I don't know how they could make this kind of mistake. On the dvd cd it even says Usher big in black but when i put it in the dvd player it's Pink the singer. If you have this dvd please tell me if your usher dvd does the same.,1027036800,,541,3.5546218487394956

7962754,5,B000067IWX,Usher realease his first DVD single and more... and this is one of the best artist out right now and He could be better than Michael Jackson if he releases another 2 or 3 CD's and keep doing what he does best.... U Don't Have To Call a single that did alot of things in the U.S and U Got It Bad a TRUE single and classic......... 1.,1023062400,,332,3.8970588235294117
