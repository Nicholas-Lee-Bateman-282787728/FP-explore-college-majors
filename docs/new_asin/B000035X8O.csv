8611668,5,B000035X8O,"This is the movie that started it all.  Great music (even today!) and cool riding fill this movie from start to finish.  If you haven't seen it yet, it is worth getting just for the funny Elvis footage!  You gotta see it and  then you will laugh outloud.  If you haven't seen it in a while it  definetly should be seen again and added to your video collection.  Oh  yeah, you don't want to miss the interviews with Travis Pastrana, James  Stewart, and RC from their mini days.  These interviews are very very  funny.  Plus, it's cool to see what these stars were like back in the day.",956016000,,584,4.305555555555555
