2593013,5,B000FW4N60,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this, other than that I'm researching this subject personally. Honestly, I'm a visual person, and the cover didn't attract me, nor did the initial start up music (not my style) when I popped the first dvd in... But WOW!

WOW is exactly the right word, because this dvd series really wowed me, blew away my expectations and beyond.

First of all, it does not go off on extra-Biblical speculations, but really delves INTO the Scriptures (with an obvious DEEP respect for them).

Secondly, it's obvious that a lot of research and careful planning went into this series. I kept thinking throughout how well laid out it was. I never felt like I was wasting my time--it was always thorough, thought-provoking, respectful of all sides, and yet VERY very challenging.

The quotes by complementarian leaders and the the audio bites--wow... Breath-taking stuff. At times my jaw was just stuck hanging open in amazement.

I would recommend this dvd series to any on either side. If anything, it will help you see where pro-women-in-ministry people are coming from--that it's not always just a ""liberal"" thing, but that many evangelical/fundamental Christians are asking questions BASED on the Scriptures, not in spite of it. I am not sure if anyone could come away from this series not challenged in some way. It really was that well done.",1163462400,11,1372,4.896551724137931
8127546,4,B000FW4N60,"Though I don't agree with all of what is presented, the vast majority is right on Biblically in my opinion.  Many in ""biblically conservative""  churches are diverted from God's truth on this subject by present culture, lack of understanding of historical biblical culture and misinterpretation of a small handful of texts.  It's better to be biblical, than it is to be ""conservative""!",1388188800,,384,5.161290322580645
8127547,4,B000FW4N60,"I have purchased this DVD because I was looking for an explanation about some verses that apparently conflict with God's message.
The DVD is well researched and presents a lot of information about Jewish culture and how to read some Bible's passages in light of the Jewish cultural context, referencing to the commentaries by Adam Clarke and John Lightfoot, among others.
The DVD attempts to explain that men and women are created equal and they were both designed to rule over their family.
This DVD also presents and criticizes the complementarian's view, referring mainly to the book Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, edited by Dr. Grudem and Dr. Piper.
I believe that everyone will find this DVD informative, entertaining,  and useful to help making up his/her mind,  regardless of their opinion on this subject,",1332979200,,825,5.149253731343284
8127548,2,B000FW4N60,"I shudder at the bickering and biting and devouring of each other that this topic has brought forth. I am a woman, and am all for equal rights: I work full time and study and can comprehend the scriptures too ;) I have felt terribly wounded by this feeling of dismissal and rejection women in the church, mostly concerning the priestly role. It seems like disrespect based solely on gender, and it hurts greatly to hear people say disdainfully that women should be ""barefoot and pregnant"", ""helpmeets"", blah blah blah blah blah.  Especially when it comes from men of God or Gods word Himself! Wow...that really stings more than it would from just any old redneck. :'(

I preface my comments with the above because I sincerely desired that this presentation give me a good reason to continue in the good fight against all unfairness and inequality when something in me didn't feel right about it. But despite all the intellectual arguments put forth by Ms. Schatz, I became unconvinced of her viewpoint in the end. First, it spoke as mere intellectualism and not to my heart or spirit at all (except in warning) and I stayed angry - there was not the peace I was looking for. Second, despite the intellectualism, it failed to define what in a priests role the women were looking to do, which without definition you will not answer the question of ""why"" women cannot be priests.  Were you looking to be a Catholic priest and hear confession, absolve sins, and perform transubstantiation, or contributing to a scholarly journal, be a Protestant Minister or a Deacon or Preacher or an Elder?  The whole thing started to assume the fragrance of wounded pride and rebellion: ""don't tell me what I can and cannot do! You're not the boss of ME! I'm as good as you are!""  Isn't that what Cain thought of Abel and his sacrifice to God? Third, I did research each claim myself, and I do not think that the arguments stand up under close scrutiny concerning the priesthood (such as a Catholic priest).

I agree that women can preach, teach, set doctrine, and inspire zeal and holiness. I listen to and read many of their works, and out of 33 doctors of the Catholic church, 3 are women. Their writings are fabulous, as are the men's. I agree that women can write scholarly journals, be great counselors and directors, etc. Gosh, I seek both men and women in all of those things.

But all this discussion misses a crucial point: the point is that the priesthood is not a thing to be grasped, much like Jesus did not find equality with God something to be grasped. The priesthood is not about power and pride, yet when the subject of women priests is discussed, it elicits those very things. Let it go. We're called to be of one accord, humble servants of all, not self important covetous and rebellious creatures. I have come to understand the order of God: Jesus is the bridegroom, His church is His bride, and women (in this life) are the bride of God and man - but we are not his priest. God values order, obedience and unity in His members more than sacrifice or rebellion. Power, pride, rebellion and selfishness are not of God.

So, despite all that, why did I give it two stars - why not one? Because there was good effort in the research, it was well organized, concise, and it was interesting to listen to the arguments put forth while I wrestled and prayed over this subject. The real ""decision"" was made in my spirit and heart, but the intellect was warring against them. Refuting the arguments helped my intellect get in unison with what the warning in my gut was telling me.  This precious union freed me to once again have a grateful and peaceful heart, and a gentle spirit towards God - to delight in all His tender care and mercy. He is so awesome.

God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him...surely our King rewards us in other ways. When I read Songs in the OT, it is such a glorious reward we have here and now. When I meditate on Mary's humility in Luke 1-2, I see that she never grasped at power and prestige: ""Hey all you Apostles - I gave birth to and raised that boy - y'all ought to listen to ME. No one knows Him better than His mama. I was at the cross, not you!""  Our Lord has His reasons for doing things His way. He Himself bore the ultimate unfairness. Trust Him in humbleness dear sisters, our reward will be great in heaven. This life is but a mere moment.

Best regards to you, and may the humility, the love and peace of God our Father and of our Lord Jesus Christ abundantly grace your hearts.",1284076800,,4526,4.479368932038835
8127549,5,B000FW4N60,"This is a great way to get the essentials of the egalitarian position without having to read through numerous books. It was wonderful to share with my husband who is a new Christian and doesn't have time to read much.
 I love the exposing clips of the complimentarian position done from their own audio teachings. My favorite line was from John MacArthur saying ""women were created to need a savior"".WOW thats heresy! No one,male or female,was originally CREATED to need a savior,but since sin came into the world we have all needed a savior...",1240272000,2,544,4.787234042553192
8127550,5,B000FW4N60,"Wow! As much fun as it is to tell women to shutup, take off their shoes, and go to the kitchen -- I think those days are coming to an end -- at least as far as the bible is concerned.

who also made us able ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.
(2 Corinthians 3:6 LITV)

I could never figure out where in ""the law"" it teaches that women need to shut up at church?

But the ""talmud"" does teach this and Paul was correcting a Talmudic Jew who was angry that women were speaking in tongues, and prophesying and carrying on in the Holy Spirit in general.

When I told one of my religious friends what's on these DVD's he said, ""let's see who should I believe Joseph (yours truly) or Paul? Hmmmm I'll choose Paul..."" meaning that he didn't believe it and he still thinks the point of the bible is to make women shut up at church and be seen and not heard.

That's his little slice of hell. I'm sold -- in the Spirit we're all the same!

Awesome resource to show how when the bible is read ""literally"" instead of ""spiritually"" it kills instead of brings life.",1227398400,4,1124,4.180555555555555
8127551,5,B000FW4N60,"Cheryl has presented us with a well researched DVD set on women. Carefully, point by point she presents her case.  It is both easy to understand and deeply theological at the same time.  This is a must have for anyone wanting to know more about the debatable Scriptures on Women in the Bible.",1219536000,3,292,4.490566037735849
8127552,5,B000FW4N60,"I have to admit that when I purchased this DVD set, I was expecting to find some liberal theology. Not so. After reading Cheryl's blog and watching this series many times, I know that Cheryl is dedicated to ONLY the truth in the Word. She has done her homework and one thing you will NOT find is any proof texting of scripture. Her love of the Word and our Lord, Jesus Christ shines through. Get your Bible out when you watch!

Cheryl is very careful to give all resources and references so everything is easy to check out. I had always felt there were clear contradictions in scripture about women and 'roles'. Now, I understand there is NO such contradictions... only error in teaching.",1201132800,4,688,4.548387096774194
8127553,5,B000FW4N60,"I am a Senior Pastor of a Foursquare Church.  I have never been satisfied with the interpretations offered over several difficult verses which seem to restrict women in ministry.  Not because I did not like them, but those interpretations left God Almighty constantly contradicting His word, or at least these interpretations.  This DVD did an outstanding job of linking the passages together and answering them in a thoughtful and exceptionally Borean way.  And they no longer make God out to be a contradictor of His own word.  Wonderful job Holy Spirit, Thank you.",1198108800,3,567,5.053763440860215
8127554,5,B000FW4N60,"Yes Women Can Teach In Leadership!

Cheryl Schatz has done her homework in a very thorough and thought-provoking manner. She brings to our attention the pertinent scriptural teaching that helps us see the freedom women are given by the Lord for leadership in the church and the exercise of their God-given spiritual gifts.

Every Thing is Scripture In Context Not ""Adding or ""Taking Away"". The video is done tastefully for those who oppose and is done with Great Care! This DVD set is a must for every Christians Library an or Church Library as well.

Also notice that the reviews about this DVD that you are now reading are coming from Men not only women! I back this DVD up 100% The Teaching is so Powerful and Biblical!",1196640000,2,722,4.625
8127555,5,B000FW4N60,"This is very very thoughtful presentation covering the puzzling ""women and ministry"" verses in the Bible.  She gives a very compelling argument as to why these verses may not actually mean what the gender hierarchicalists say they mean.  I learned a lot from this set, she has some insights I have not seen elsewhere and this is one of my focus study areas.  Her main topics are Genesis 1-3, 1 Corinthians 11 and 14, and 1 Timothy 2.

I was very impressed with the way she treated her theological opponents with respect.  She includes audio quotes, so one can hear the actual tone of voice in her opponents.  Some of the quotes astounded (and ssddened) me.  You can see for yourself how much eisegesis her opponents do and read into the text what is not there.

If you are puzzled by these verses or even if think you know what these verses mean, you really owe it to yourself to check out this set, as one  seems right until the other is heard.  Be a Berean.",1185667200,3,959,4.3977272727272725
