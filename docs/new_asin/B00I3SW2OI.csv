8638825,3,B00I3SW2OI,"I like this film conceptually, and although I can tell it was on budget, I liked the sets and characters.  The film has fun with the ideas.  However, the directing feels flat, there is no energy or whimsy.  Too often it tries to rely on music to sell the tone.  The actors are no always on, they aren't giving it 110% and after a while the film feels lethargic.",1471564800,,361,4.188405797101449
