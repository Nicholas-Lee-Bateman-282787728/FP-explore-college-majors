8435726,5,B004M9QNUG,A few years ago I tried to purchase this video only to find out at check out it wouldn't be able to be shipped to where I live and I was so disappointed. Now I FINALLY got my hands on this DVD and it was worth the wait to get it! Too bad it wasn't worth the viewing time. It was so BORING!,1479254400,,289,3.6031746031746033

8435728,3,B004M9QNUG,"The original documentary film of the Hindenburg disaster is impressive. However, I thought that the reenactment of the escape of the airmen from the tail section of the ship was poorly acted and even, perhaps, a little pointless. I am sure the cost of production would have been huge and have to wonder if it was really worth the effort!",1453766400,,337,4.633333333333334
8435729,1,B004M9QNUG,"This is NOT the wonderful 1996 A&E documentary as described on the container but the 1975 Universal theatrical film, in a terrible transfer! What were you thinking, History Channel?",1440115200,,181,5.275862068965517
8435730,5,B004M9QNUG,We watched the Hindenburg first and found it extremely informative and helped to put a better understanding into the making of the Hindenburg.  It was amazing the work that was done before making the  movie.  If you enjoy history you will enjoy both this movie and The Hindenburg.,1377129600,,280,4.791666666666667
8435731,5,B004M9QNUG,"I have been a student of the Hindenburg tragedy for years and really enjoyed the video. Although it was not the one I originally thought that it might be, it turned out to be thoroghly fascinating. For those that enjoy Historic mysteries and recreations, I highly recommend this home video!",1358380800,,290,4.82
8435732,1,B004M9QNUG,I purchased this DVD in hopes that it would be a documentry about the the Hindenburg.  It was only a making of a digital recreation for a small film.  Don't bother!,1354924800,,164,4.258064516129032
8435733,5,B004M9QNUG,"I highly recommend this documentary. Verrry interesting. I just wish it was longer. I didn't want it to end.
The History Channel is always fascinating. Well done!",1315008000,,162,5.037037037037037
