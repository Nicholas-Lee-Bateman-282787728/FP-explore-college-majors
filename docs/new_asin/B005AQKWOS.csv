No HD Telecine was done for the first season of The Big O. This is unacceptable since the first season is almost entirely
film based, (the second season is all digital aside from flashbacks/reused footage from the first.) Now there could be two reasons for this: 1) they lost the original film master, so they had no choice but to upscale SD masters. 2) remastering will cost them too much considering the prospective sale figure. After all, the show was not that popular in Japan. Another bummer is the TV OP 1 isn't included...DOUBLE FAIL. For whatever reason, the JP DVD box sets used the 2nd season OP for all episodes, while the US releases used the first season OP for all episodes. LOL, a lot of issues.

Either way, The Big O deserved better. If they don't think it's worth spending the money to do a HD telecine for an anime
that's film based, then it's not worth the spending the insane amount of money on their release. Vote with your wallet. Better hope no US company re-releases this in West until a proper restoration is done. At least they got Roger Smith's No. 1 rule right, (which a US company could never do) - black Blu-ray cases.",1411171200,10,1261,4.478260869565218
