7911061,2,B00000IO02,"The history of the the Academy Awards is interesting,but this collection has flaws. I tried contacting Mill creek to report that Martin Luther King Jr wasn't assassinated in 1967. I called 8 years ago. You can't sell DVD collections with wrong information in them. I'm very disappointed in them.",1521849600,,295,5.040816326530612
7911062,5,B00000IO02,"This THREE-DISC sets contains TEN HOURS of OSCAR history, trivia and information!  In addition to a year-by-year chronicle of the Oscar CEREMONIES, there is a PHOTO GALLERY of Oscar winners and a SEARCH ENGINE!  BE WARNED!  This set only covers the FIRST 50 YEARS of the Oscars!  This is a LOW QUALITY product that will make you wonder why somebody has not bothered to do the ACADEMY AWARDS up right!  But if you want to see what happened at the Oscars BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, then this will certainly manage to at least do that!",1001808000,16,527,4.505263157894737
7911063,2,B00000IO02,"This three-disc boxed set is amateurish and disappointing. As an avid Oscar follower and fan, I considered this a must buy, but don't be fooled by the lack of similar titles  - this just isn't worth it. The series is  dogged by repetitive footage (no interviews are included, only scenes from  trailers) and monotone narration that frankly drives you crazy after a few  minutes. Very little insight is brought to the Oscars story, and the few  bits of interesting information that are included would barely fill a 10  minute segment. At almost 10 hours, you can see how padded out it is...  And, to add insult to injury, the image and sound quality is poor and the  packaging shoddy! If you're interested in this subject, buy the Academy's  authorised book ""70 Years of the Oscar"" instead...",964915200,37,791,4.757352941176471
7911064,1,B00000IO02,"Bad audio, lousy picture quality. Enough said? Do yourself a favor: do not buy this insult to dvd technology.",947462400,8,109,4.7894736842105265
