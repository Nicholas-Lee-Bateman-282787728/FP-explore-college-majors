8519555,4,B007MS6N2C,"This 1950 relatively short (just over an hour) black and white B film with stereotypical subplots was interesting enough that I watched it until the end. Connors is a well-informed sergeant, who knows the ways of local Indians (a group of Apaches), is part of a small group of soldiers under the command of a lieutenant who is a graduate of West Point and who had been in the army for nine years (he counted his four years in West Point), in comparison to just over four years for Connors. The lieutenant also fought in Indian wars in the east. But the lieutenant feels that non-officers know nothing worth hearing. He makes many mistakes, such as thinking it best to corral the horses apart from the men so that their sleep would not be disturbed. Connors had suggested they be placed near the men. As a result, the Indians stole the horses. Besides the errors in judgment, the lieutenant is harmed by the heat and sun while they walked to the fort. Connors takes over command. The lieutenant calls it mutiny and most of the men agree with the lieutenant.
Connors, of course, is not perfect. He dislikes all Indians. This situation changes when the small troop found two beautiful women, one of whom was the daughter of the warring Apache chief. There are attempts by the soldiers to rape the two women.  The lieutenant swears that Connors will face jail time for mutiny, and most of the troops agree. The troopers face attacks by the much larger number of Apaches. It seems they will all die. But will they die?",1470614400,,1513,4.583025830258302

8519558,3,B007MS6N2C,"The acting is good,story is good,casting good,b&w,1 hour long,and transfer is a 3 out of 5. The dvd-r skips out toward the end, so you miss the ending. A good solid western with Chuck Connors at his best...support your favorite artists.",1370044800,2,236,4.780487804878049

8519560,5,B007MS6N2C,"Facing a court martial, Sgt. McCoy (Chuck Connors) takes over command from an ignorant officer (injured from an indian attack) who has no clue about leadership and chooses his ego over the safety of his men. Before the group reaches an empty fort, they are attacked by indians several times featuring some good action. Anyone doubting McCoy's leadership, is immediately put in their place. Two cuties are captured (one indian, and one indian raised white) causing drama with the restless men. Using a firm hand and a stern voice, McCoy convincingly scolds those who get out of line. Overcoming their differences, the troops face an all-out assault on the fort by the Apaches. Connors easily carries this film and gives us a rare chance to see him in another western outside of the Rifleman! Fullscreen dvd video and audio is surprisingly good.",1361750400,10,843,4.943661971830986
8519561,4,B007MS6N2C,"This movie was a big surprise for me. As a fan of Chuck Conners I had to have it for my collection. The Video quality was good and sound as well.  Once I started to watch it I was glad I purchased it.  Not Academy Award material but worth a look on a rainy day. Nice to see Chuck Conners in a different role from ""The Rifleman""  which I also own the entire series on DVD.",1352764800,4,371,3.8552631578947367
