8756175,5,B01DKGAR1M,"This movie is beautifully animated, and just so good. Typical Square Enix, and a must for any Final Fantasy fans.

This box does include the english dub for Kingsglaive. The box is beautiful and the art book is really cool to have.

There really isn't much else to say. It's a great film.",1478995200,2,288,4.415094339622642
