4182939,3,B003R9IET0,"This movie was ok not funny nothing out of the norm.

I would not recommend it.

The story goes not were not climax or anything resolved.

Just one night and four stupid guys that have no life who get into
some trouble. And then go home in the morning.",1314662400,,252,4.1020408163265305

Most of these movies are sad and depressing, sometimes diluting the good will behind them. The exquisite ""La ltima is nos Vamos"" takes a different approach and the result is fascinating. It has charm, humor, political undertones, humanity, and it is also very sexy.

""La ltima is nos Vamos"" is a phrase, quite common in Latin America, which is said by people before they leave a party, sort of the ""last drink before we go."" Where I come from [Panama], we call it ""el arranque"" (start leaving). And the title of the film fits well, because that is precisely what the story is about. In it, four friends, from well-to-do families, decide to get together for some drinks and fun in the well-known Plaza Garibaldi, a popular place in Mexico City. They appear to be easy-going, fun-loving fellows, with no bad intentions. After some time, they decide to split: two will remain in Plaza Garibaldi and two will leave and go to a strip joint, to see if they get lucky. The rest of the film, which I can not go into detail without giving away the story, follows the lives of these young men that night and what happens to them. And, as we follow these guys, we discover another part of Mexico City at night that is unknown to many, and director Eva Lopez-Snchez does a great job in slowly building the climax, without giving any clues that might make us guess the ending.

""La ltima is nos Vamos"" takes a creative look at the lives of the have and have nots in Mexico City in a very smart way, making the point without depressing the hell out of us. There are good guys and bad guys in both sides, and the film was done based on several real-life stories. The movie cast is amazing, with Juan Pablo Campa, Sebastin Hiriart, Manuel Garca-Rulfo, Gabino Rodrguez, Montserrat De Len, and Liz Gallardo in the main roles, supported by veteran actors Luis Felipe Tovar, Roberto Sosa and Lisa Owens.

8403470,3,B003R9IET0,"From the site's description of the film, I expected something of a little more substance, a bit more thought-provoking.  However, what I got was a couple of hours of entertainment more like an episode of a soap opera for cholos than an edgy, artsy, deeply thought-provoking or disturbing Almodovar production.",1419465600,,309,5.18

8403474,3,B003R9IET0,"The movie is about the night out of four friends from the upper class. The portrayal of the nightlife of Mexico city is picturesque, and the strength of the movie probably lies in its display of the close coexistence in this very city of 1st and 3rd world.
The ability of the different characters to bridge the social gap seems however overly optimistic, kind of fairy tale or ""Pretty woman"" like. In the end, as far as I am concerned, the movie lacks bite.
Not suitable for classroom activity, a few scenes with nudity.",1357948800,3,520,4.542553191489362
8403475,4,B003R9IET0,"Having just watched Fuera Del Cielo immediately before watching this film, I expected a lot more to go wrong in the way of violence and crime, in Mexico City.  Instead this film, effortlessly follows three separate, but equally interesting stories, as the four young men separate and have their own adventures and misadventures, over one evening. All of the actors are good, but I especially liked the beautiful Montserrat De Leon as the Bus Driver (that is her on the DVD cover.)  This is more of a character study and the connections the characters make with the people they meet that night. This was not really a comedy, but there were some funny moments.  Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  I liked the fact that most of the characters were decent people and not the usual jerks that inhabit the American version of this type of film.  The subtitles were a little quick and I had to hit pause a few times to keep up, but otherwise no other problems. Good Direction by Eva Lopez-Sanchez.",1355184000,,993,4.651428571428571
