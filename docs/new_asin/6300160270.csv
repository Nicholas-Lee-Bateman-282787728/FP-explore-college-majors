210418,5,6300160270,"This is the best of the series.  All three of my kids have loved it and the video keeps their attention throughout.  I don't approve of using TV as a babysitter but this video gives me a 30 minute un-interrupted break to do  laundry, cook dinner, read, or even take a short nap.",953683200,,278,4.2075471698113205
210419,5,6300160270,"A friend of mine passed on 3 volumes of baby songs to me when I was pregnant.  I began playing the videos for my daughter when she was about 4 months old.  She was and still is (at 8 months) mesmerized by the videos.  She will sit for the entire 30 minute viewing session.  In addition, when I  sing the songs to her, she immediately calms down. There is nothing else on  TV that holds my daughter's attention.  I have tried a number of other  videos, but for some reason the Baby Songs videos are her only interest.  Hap Palmer's use of real people combined with appropriate song make his  Baby Songs video a hit!",953510400,,614,4.260869565217392

I SOMETIMES  FIND MYSELF WATCHING IT WITH JOY AND WHEN IM NOT WORKING IT SEEMS AS IF I  AM SINGING THE SONGS ALL THE TIME.

I've tried putting other videos in the machine but this is the only one he will sit down and watch.  He gets so excited seeing the other real children.  I just hope that he'll  get the gist of ""My Mommy Comes Back"" very soon!  I can't wait to  get the rest of the collection.",947462400,2,392,3.9615384615384617
210422,5,6300160270,Better than a baby swing! My seven month old is absolutely absorbed in it! He watches it repeatedly. The only thing I regret about it is the inconvenience of having to rewind it again and again for him to watch over  and over. I highly recommend it!

Being produced in the 80's, it's not as slick and sharp resolution as modern stuff, but it has heart, it's charming and kids still love it.  Better than anything they are making today.",1482796800,4,484,4.322222222222222

I gave her this DVD, as a gift for her daughter, and she and I sang the songs (by memory)...still favorites, after all these years. These songs are great for helping toddlers learn some of the basic things in life, like letting go of your blankie long enough for it to be washed...and that no matter where or for how long your Mom leaves you, she ALWAYS comes back to get you.",1480118400,,517,4.285714285714286

I scoffed originally despite the knowing smile from the mom gifting Hap Palmer's original Baby Songs tape, but it turned out was like magic; entertaining a fussy month or two old baby and held their interested until they were ready for preschool.  They never got tired of it.  Nothing soothed better for some reason.  But it worked its magic on them.

Now that I am a grandparent, the DVD I bought is doing the same magical and mesmerizing work on my first grandchild.  Baby songs only gets played probably once a week but kids months old to years old are transfixed.

Now our grandchildren are enjoying the series as their parents continue to add good memories to their old ones! It's a joyful noise, kids singing along & interacting without it being obnoxious. I always felt good about popping one of these in to watch. It just promoted good feelings all around! I can't imagine any child not enjoying the program!",1406592000,,607,4.241379310344827

My 26 year-old daughter is now expecting her own little one, and is excited to bring Hap Palmer's Baby Songs to a new generation! I must say, however, that we enjoyed listening to the songs more than watching the video, but that was long ago, so maybe today's kids prefer to watch a video.",1405987200,,564,4.475728155339806

They sing about things relevant to the children's lives. I would recommend the songs for between 6 months - 4 or 5 years old. Infants and toddlers love to watch other children. As a rule I didn't watch television with my children when they were young with the exceptions of some DVD's and Baby Songs were among the few.

All of the grandchildren had the CD and now the great-grandchildren will have one too.

HOWEVER; our son, 15 months old, LOVES it. He asks for it a lot.  And after you get over the initial ""this is weird!"" impression, the songs will grow on you and you will see how much your kid loves it.  Do not abandon it quickly like some people have done.  My wife and i have lots of little jokes about it and we make fun of the people in the video (dont judge me until you SEE them) while our son enjoys it. Win-Win.

The dvd has an option to put the songs on a loop which is nice, but we haven't tried it yet.

She LOVES this video and watches it just about everyday for 30 minutes.  She has learned the tunes to several of the songs and likes to repeat the fun actions that the kids perform in various parts of the video.  One of her favorite songs is ""So Big"" and after watching it on the video, she now nods her head ""yes, yes, yes"" the same way. Even our 4  1/2 year old enjoys watching it with her little sister and quickly learned all the songs to which she happily sings throughout the day.

I think it's the guy's voice, plus I think the songs are relatable for a toddler.  It's just perfect for that age.  It was my brother-in-law's favorite VHS as a kid (he's now 17) and all the kids my mother-in-law watched loved it as well.  When my daughter was a baby my MIL pulled it out and had her watch it.  I was like whatever, she'll never like this, but she loved it so much I ended up buying my in-laws the DVD for their house to replace the old VHS.  Now I'm looking for a CD of the songs to play in the car because my daughter is always requesting them and my singing voice is not the greatest!

It didn't take long for me to notice that my kids were MESMERIZED by Palmer's music videos.  I quickly recognized the prints and hairstyles from my own childhood (80's kid) and went on a search until I found the DVD's here.  The kids LOVED them and now that they are almost two they actually ask for them by name.  I would HIGHLY recommend these DVD's to anyone who is interested in exposing their children to music, rhyming, social skills, development skills, sillyness and laughter via your DVD player.  I am not saying they take the place of actual experiences but they sure do enhance them.  You don't know how handy it is to get your triplet toddlers to quickly cooperate and follow instructions by just singing a simple song to them. Anyway, long story short....

I thought about how much they used to love this video.  I figured I would give it a shot and try to find it and here it is.  My kids used to watch it non-stop when they were little.  I ordered it and can't wait to get it for my new baby.,1179705600,,407,3.477777777777778
211014,4,6300160270,"This video is so cheesy and silly and seemingly low budget but for some reason, I haven't met a baby who isn't mesmerized by it. I had it for my kids and I just bought it for my new neice. Works every time.",1179100800,,206,3.813953488372093
211015,4,6300160270,"I was looking for some songs my 1 1/2 yr old could enjoy that were fun and cute and not commercial. She watches very little TV and when it's on, it's usually because I need her distracted. This fit the bill perfectly. Baby Einstein was boring her and she was reacting to those images in stores, but she loves songs so I bought this. The first time I watched this, I cracked up the whole time because it is a flashback to the 80's.  The hair and the clothes are so funny (as a child of the 80's).  It also has a very ""filmed in my basement"" feel to it.  Average every day (and sometimes homely) kids dancing around and making mistakes, puppets with big strings, and some strange amateur footage but through it all the cutest songs come through.  We both love the songs.  They have a very parent, real life oriented theme.  My favorite is ""My mommy comes back, she never would forget me"" (all about going to school and babysitters).  Her favorite is ""my doggie"" (person in giant dog costume dancing).  I also like ""sometimes my blanket gets washed"" and ""sharing."" You get the drift..songs about things you want kids to do.  There is a bath song, potty song, and whispering song too.",1173916800,2,1180,4.425925925925926
211016,5,6300160270,"My 17 month old twins have been enjoying this series since about 10 months old & they love it more & more every day.  As they get more coordinated & confident in the movements, they are attempting to imitate the children on the DVD and it is awesome to watch.  I highly recommend this series, especially BS ""Original"" BS ""Baby's Busy Day"" BS ""Animals"" and BS ""ABC, 123.."".  We also have BS ""Rock & Roll"", but my twins aren't too enthused by it yet...I just think it's above their developmental level currently.  A+++ Series...Highly recommend for hours of quality entertainment.",1168819200,,578,4.75
211017,5,6300160270,"My 22 month old daughter loves the Baby Songs video.  She asks for it frequently.  While the costumes, etc. are a bit dated (from the 80s), the songs are catchy and entertaining.",1168732800,,178,4.53125
211018,5,6300160270,"All 3 of my kids have enjoyed this video. I first bought the VHS version in 1997 for my son. He and his brother loved it. Now, my third child is watching the DVD and he loves it as well. They are sort of funny since they are filmed in the 80's -obvious by the clothing and hair styles. But the music is fantastic. Our family highly recommends all of the baby song videos!",1168214400,,371,4.027027027027027
211019,5,6300160270,"We bought the videos for our children years ago.  When our grand daughter turned 18 months, I went searching for the DVD.  At first we accidentally bought the CD.  Rather than send it back, we just kept it for road trips.  We ordered the DVD, being more careful this time, and we love it.  More importantly, she loves it.  It was like seeing an old friend.  Now our Natalie has music at home and in the car.  We couldn't be happier.  Good, clean songs with cute lyrics.  Truth be told, I probably love what the words say more than anything!",1163116800,3,540,4.31

My granddaughter was entertained by the singing and kids in the video literally from birth.  Now she is almost two and can sing along with the kids and do the dance moves.  I would highly recommend this video - it grows along with them and provides hours of healthy entertainment!",1152921600,,431,4.417721518987341
211027,1,6300160270,To start with...this is the first DVD I have played for my child that he did not take to immediately. Any new DVD show he stops everything he's doing and goes up to the tv to watch it. Usually takes a few times of watching something for him to finally get a little tired of it. He has never ever decided to crawl away the moment a new DVD show came on but he did with this. I had to take him over to the tv so he could see it was a new show and he had zero interest! Totally shocking! Turns out lucky me though cause this dvd and the music are horrific! Unbearable to listen to and that's putting it mildly. OMG! Just so incredibly bad I cannot even describe. You people are nuts!,1152662400,,680,3.9708029197080292
211028,5,6300160270,"We love baby songs at our house. I have a three year old and a one year old and Hap Palmer's songs never fail to put a smile on their faces. I was first introduced to Baby Songs as a teenage babysitter in the early 90's. The toddler for which I babysat had 2 Baby Songs videos which he loved to watch. I found that songs like Today I Took My Diapers Off and Sitting In My Highchair would be running through my head for days. Years later, after having a child of my own, I was delighted to discover that many of those same catchy tunes that I remembered from my babysitting days had been compiled in DVD format. We started by renting at the library and then purchased our own copies of Original Baby Songs, Baby's Busy Day, the ABC Baby Songs, and Baby Songs Animals. I prefer this Original Baby Songs and Baby's Busy Day to the other two we own, but in all fairness, my kids seem to adore all four equally. Yes, the songs are a bit corny and the hairstyles and clothes are a bit outdated (which I find endearing in a nostalgic sort of way), but your baby, toddler, or pre-schooler is sure to adore it. Isn't that what really matters? At 7 bucks it is a super bargain and I'm sure you will find it money well spent.",1147824000,,1214,4.148305084745763
211029,4,6300160270,While I enjoyed this DVD. It does not contain the all of the songs from the video More Baby Songs as is reported in some reviews. I bought this based on those reviews because those were the songs my kids wanted (they wore our video out) and only 3 of the songs are included. Just be aware.,1144368000,3,289,4.087719298245614
211030,5,6300160270,"My 15 month old loves watching baby songs!  She is very clingy, constantly right underneathe me, so when i need to cook dinner or clean i just put on babysongs and she watches it the whole time!  She dances, and tries to sing...lol !  It is soo cute!  My 4 year old also has watched babysongs since she was 1 year old, and still likes it....it is somthing they like to watch together.",1142553600,,384,4.219178082191781
211031,5,6300160270,"We had purchased this in VHS tape  format for my 7 1/2 year old when he was 2 years old.  We now have two more boys, 4 and 1, and when the tape finally failed there was no question that this was an item that had to be replaced!  My 7 year old will still sit down and watch it sometimes.

Charming songs, visually interesting footage of real kids and people, it touches on many aspects of what it's like to be a kid.  It's a great rainy day, ""I'm bored"", or all the kids are squabbling solution.",1141689600,,494,4.0
211032,5,6300160270,"I don't find this video/DVD to be corny or out-dated but perhaps I'm seeing it through a child's eyes.  It seems almost timeless. We began with Baby Einstein for our grandchildren, and then added the Baby Songs series as they got older.  This particular video is probably my favorite and our almost 2 yr old granddaughter loves the songs and asks for them by name.  When our grandson showed signs of separation anxiety in pre-school, ""My Mother Come Back"" was a big help and we still sing it.  The ""Security"" and ""Today I Took My Diaper Off"" are wonderful.  I even like ""Rub-A-Dub"" with the Alien.  The songs and visuals are intended for children, who somehow know when something is silly and not real.  I don't believe that children are instinctively afraid of things, but rather pick up cues from the adults.  Actually, the Alien is sort of endearing as he bathes and interacts with the real little boy.  This could be helpful if you have a child who does not like to take a bath.  I watch the videos with the grandchildren and we talk about them.  I like the idea that the video primarily shows real children in various situations.  I would recommend this video/DVD to everyone.",1138752000,2,1181,4.598086124401914

211034,5,6300160270,"We all love it.  My boys are 8, 6, and 10 mos.  Even my husband can't get the songs out of his head - not necessarily a good thing!, but the songs are catchy and humorous:)",1127952000,,172,3.75
211045,5,6300160270,As a Mother of 3 and grandmother of 3 I highly recomend any of Hap Palmers videos or dvd. Hap Palmers Baby Songs is one of my 14 month old grandsons favorite videos.  I have the entire collection and Nathaniel drops what he is doing and runs to the tv when he hears the theme song.  Great music with young children in every scene.,1127260800,,330,4.140625
211046,5,6300160270,"I bought Baby Songs and More Baby Songs on VHS when my 19 year old daughter was born, when these first came out in 1986.  Now she has a baby of her own (4 months) and sings these songs to him.  I am thrilled to be able to order it still and she can share the videos with Zack.  It's a sentimental thing, but they really are great - both my kids loved watching them over and over for a few years.",1125964800,,395,3.792682926829268
211047,5,6300160270,My mother originally purchased this 16 years ago for our first born and he loved it. It was on VHS and after our daughter was old enough and we thought that we wouldn't have any more kids we donated it. We had two more kids and they are 2 & 3 and they love it just as much as the older two. It is so cute to see that these songs have withstood the time and I love to hear the old songs again.,1125100800,,392,3.6785714285714284

211049,5,6300160270,"I love Hap Palmer's voice.  He has a real soothing sound.  The songs are funny.  The artwork between each song is very cute.  It's closed-captioned so you can put the words on the screen and sing along.  The diaper song is funny (how the pants are not puffed out in back, LOL!).  My baby clapped and enjoyed it.

The songs are: Piggy toes, Shout & Whisper, Share, My Mommy Comes Back, Baby's Good Doggy, Rolling, Security, Rub A Dub, Today I Took My Diapers Off, I Sleep 'Til Morning.

We also have Hap Palmer's ""Baby Songs ~ Follow Along Songs"" and ""Learning Basic Skills"".  I'd recommend them both.  Please read my other reviews for more childrens videos.",1114473600,4,657,4.538461538461538
211050,5,6300160270,If I could recommend a baby show this would be it.  How cute!  My son loves it!  This and It's Potty Time are the cutest shows.  It shows other kids his age with favorite blankets and Mommy comes back song... I think the songs are catchy and fun.  My son and even 4 year old daughter love to sing along with it.  I've even caught my 11 year old singing along too.,1104796800,,363,3.9722222222222223
211051,5,6300160270,"I recieved this as a baby shower gift from a friend who said her daughter just loved it. I thought it was a little cheesy because the look is so dated - straight out of the 80's. BUT my 15 month old daughter LOVES this video - she wants to watch it every day. She is transfixed when it is on - she just loves to watch the other children in it. It seems to be shot from a child's ponit of view, so she can relate to it. The songs are all very happy and tell about the things in a young child's life - I like them a lot. I don't like her to see much TV, but I feel good about her watching this.",1103155200,2,592,3.6692913385826773
211052,5,6300160270,"Hi. My name is Darcy

  My mother purchased ""Baby Songs"" for me in 1988 when I was two years old. We brought it when I was crying in the Albertson's in Fresno, CA. I just looved the cover, and I couldn't let go of it, so we brought it.

 Once we got home, I handed it to mom, and she put it in the VCR, and I loved it.

 It teaches you about sharing, getting things washed in the washing machine, and how to ""Shout and Whisiper"" (I love you!)

It's like yesterday, I was threee again... Shout and whisper, that's what we do/ shout and whisper I love you /Shout! I love you!/Whisper I love you""!

Perhaps the song that still forver touches my heart is with the puppet, in bed, flying over the moon. He sings

""I rest until the birdie sings/ goodbye to the golden moon""...

 I had a dream when I was little that I was doing that, along with Bert and Ernie :-)

 I also like the ""Don't Take my Blankie Away"" song. That's still my number one joint!

 Anyways, I STRONGLY reccomend this video, even if it is seventeen years old. It will forever stay with them, like it did with me! And I'm eighteen now!",1097884800,,1098,4.1084905660377355
211053,5,6300160270,"I bought this video on sale (...)thinking that if my son did not like it,  it was not a big waste of money.  He now watches it at least once a day.  We also have the Baby Songs, Baby's Busy Day which he also watches at least once a day.  Now normally I would not let him watch that much t.v. but our 3 year old son has a severe language delay and since he started watching these videos he has been singing along, using more words and is communicating much better.  They are not annoying at all and are in a nice laid back format.  The music would be great in the car.",1094342400,,567,3.9298245614035086
211054,4,6300160270,"My 15 month toddler is absolutely addicted to this video.  Ask him ""How big is baby?"" and he throws up his hands like the kids in the song ""So Big"".  He claps along with the kids, spins when they spin and so on.  I like it, too, because MOST of the songs are very cute and educational.  But I have to skip ""Rub A Dub"" with the ugly alien, and ""Shout and Whisper"" with the shouting.  With time, I've learned to ignore the very dated costumes, which remind me of my high school days.  The main drawback -- the embarrassment of being caught singing ""I have a little potty of my very own..."" in the grocery store.  It's a catchy tune!",1091836800,,630,4.1570247933884295

211066,5,6300160270,"This video was played and replayed for my 2 sons and nephew.  They absolutely loved to bop along when they were younger, and soon started to sing along.  The lyrics are cute and fun, and the accompanying stories on the live action video were eye catching.  This was a must in our VCR whenever the boys were cranky.  I have a newborn, and can't wait to see if he finds it as compelling as his older brothers.

Whenever we need a little ""down"" time, we ask him if he would like to see ""Baby Songs"" and he gets this big grin and I know we have thirty minutes to enjoy him being a ""baby"", and we get to relax a little as anyone knows a two year old is a handful!

I swear he is singing along with the all the songs.  We don't have a dog and He keeps saying doggie. Which is from the song ""Baby's Good Doggie"".  You will find yourself singing the songs to your baby all the time.  My husbund does too!  I just recently purchased the Baby songs play along songs tape which is also really good.

211071,4,6300160270,"This video will either be a great hit, or it won't. When I first put the video in the VCR I geared up for a disappointment - I think this was filmed in the 80s, and the production quality is on the low side...but I was surprised! My 2 year-old absolutely adored it, and he didn't care that it looked home-made. And, best of all, I didn't find it irritating. Hap Palmer has a smooth, enjoyable voice, and his songs are homey and easy to sing along with. I get a real kick out of some of the lyrics he sings without busting out laughing! Can you imagine standing with a guitar and singing ""I have a little potty of my very own, it has a yellow duckie to hold on to,"" without laughing? Good for him.
My son will put this video in the VCR by himself. And if I put it in, he will stop what he's doing and settle down to watch. It's a perfect length at just about 30 minutes, and the animated segments in between songs are well done and your little one will be able to identify them. I think the worst segment on the video is the last, which uses a really hokey marionnette sequence - talk about piles of fishing line all over the screen! The song is OK, so I just shut my eyes or walk out of the room for that one :-)
But on the whole, it's surprisingly good enough and engaging enough that I'd have no problem expanding my Hap Palmer library. It just goes to show you that often simple IS best.",985564800,11,1390,4.058181818181819
