8206539,3,B000SSETB0,"A three hour plus DVD that tells you, the viewer all about a large outdoor UK music festival that featured many bands of various genres - psychedelic, punk, progressive, folk and reggae. Event took place over the course of several years but I'm pretty sure that most of what you see here is from 1978. The music segments are okay - some have a slide show of each band to go along with a chosen track of theirs - others feature actual 'rare' video footage of the artist performing live. Wanted to make it quite clear that 'Deeply Vale Festivals' is not a concert DVD, but a documentary. Part one (102 minutes) shows you songs by Here And Now, Spizz Energi, Wilful Damage (really liked these guys), The Fall, Tractor, The Ruts, Nik Turner, Body, Steve Hillage, Accident On The East Lanes, Fast Cars and a an unknown new waver / punk wanna-be Elti Fits covering David Bowie's ""Rebel Rebel"". Part two (48 minutes) have interviews with some of the artists now to get their perspective of Deeply Vale here - some thirty years later. Part three (50 minutes) brings you more interviews. Enjoy.",1256428800,,1085,4.597938144329897
