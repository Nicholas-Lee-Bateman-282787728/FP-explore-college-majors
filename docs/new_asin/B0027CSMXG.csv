3864347,5,B0027CSMXG,"If you love Prison break and miss it, then this is the the set for you to have. It takes you from the pilot that started it all to the last season. Seems  so long ago that it all began, the actors seemed so new . Fallin love with it all over again,and be reminded why you do and will always have a place in your heart. I recomend this very much,and for me its a precious treasure. A must have!(I recomend  ""the fianl break"" to complete the set.)",1264809600,14,445,3.9887640449438204
3864348,5,B0027CSMXG,"I'm sure by reading some of the reviews on certain seasons, some people will hate mine because I do agree, that Prison break should've ended at season 3.

For the past month I've watched all 4 seasons and I am on of the biggest fan's of the series. This was my second time watching it in it's entirety (Watched it when it aired, and just now on DVD). I love the series and am sad to see it all over.

There are 4 seasons to prison break, and a movie which is supposed to fill in all the gaps and loopholes the series left. In my opinion, season 1 was the absolute best, followed by season 3, then 2, and then 4. Season 4 was all over the place. It's hard to explain without spoiling anything, but in the last 6 or 7 episodes there was always a huge swerve that completly changed everything, and it just felt rushed upon us. The ending of the series happens way too fast as well. Season 4 in comparison to the others was a huge dissapointment.

The casting was great, almost perfect. Dominic Purcell and Wentworth Miller (They play the protagonists; Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows) did an amazing job, and really get you to believe them.

Season 1 has to go down in history in my opinion, as one of the best debut seasons of any show in the past decade.

I love the series, and the way season 3 ends, it could've definitly ended there and should've. Season 4 just made everything way too unrealistic, even by TV standards.

Anyway, I still say this is definitly a pick-up. Personally my favorite TV series I've ever had the pleasure of watching.",1256947200,33,1550,4.346020761245675

3864423,4,B0027CSMXG,"Easily one of my favorite shows, but I was very disapointed to find that the last season is not dubbed in Spanish. I had seen the whole series on Netflix and decided to use this as quality viewing time with my family, but bought the dvds specifically so that they would be able to enjoy it in their native language. So imagine my surprise when the last box was not, especially when they were already hooked on it! So the docked star is for false advertising of the product, not for the show itself.

3864425,1,B0027CSMXG,Started watching it somewhere in the middle.  Not my cup of tea.  These kinds of shows I expect a little realism.  This show definitely doesn't care about that.  I can't grasp these prisoners have that kind of freedom & control.  I'm sorry not my cup of tea.  I'd rather rewatch the sopranos,1465689600,,291,4.5

3864435,4,B0027CSMXG,"Ok, I am a 75-year-old woman who generally likes good literature. Dr Zhivago is my all time favorite movie. A younger friend practically forced me into watching the premier of Prison Break. That said, I was hooked from the start. For the next  two weeks and 79 episodes I got very little sleep.  While myriad with unlikely incidences this series has more cliff-hangers than the Grand Canyon. Anyone expecting more than pure fantasy will be disappointed. This is high entertainment with a great cast of intriguing characters. The acting is excellent and the action non-stop. Wentworth Miller and Sarah Wayne Callies are certainly not hard to look at and it was so refreshing that their romance had depth instead of the usual sweaty sex. Robert Knepper made my skin crawl as intended. Fichtner always delivers and the rest of the characters were loveable and/or hateable by turns. There  is lots of bloody violence but I applaud the writers for the lack of foul language. Very happy to hear there will be another season.",1449360000,,1018,4.872832369942197
3864436,3,B0027CSMXG,"Some mild spoilers here...
The series is well written and well shot. The characterizations are complex and the characters believable and you care about them. The acting is not all that great, though. The actors are more there for eye candy and strong characterizations, particularly the brother, Lincoln, on death row, although Michael isn't far behind trying to see how far you can act your way through a series simply by looking intense and enigmatic and whispering a lot. The plot points are 90% predictable and it is child's play to predict what comes next or even exactly what a character will say, but I do have to give the writers credit for throwing in a few good red herrings and other unexpected turns of events to account for the other 10% such as how it plays out when son T.J. is waiting hoping for his father to show up but also waiting and hoping to flush him out are the bad guys. Watching the series, for me, is like tearing your hair out, where almost everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong and the plots and even individual scenes can just drag out forever, seemingly just to extend the drama and pad out more episodes. Such a majorly-overextended scene is the one with Sara (the lady prison doctor) being threatened by the inmates trying to break in her office during a riot in Season One, a scene that is spread out over 2 episodes and, although including the time spent cutting to other scenes, takes in excess of what seems to be 20 minutes. A solid 3 stars, but why not just try a solid 4 star show such as Strike Back (although that show is maybe going to appeal more to guys than gals).",1448323200,,1625,4.456375838926174
3864437,4,B0027CSMXG,"Saw most of this series when it first aired. Mostly high quality action/suspense material.
I'm writing this mostly to help everybody avoid the confusion concerning this Blu-ray package and the Blu-ray of ""The Final Break."" When I ordered this complete four season package I didn't know it included ""The Final Break"" in it. Yes, at the end of the editorial review it says ""including The Final Break"" and if you zoom in on the photo of the back of the package, it says the same, but I didn't notice so I ordered the separate Blu-ray of The Final Break. Lucky for me, I got the ""Complete"" package first and when I saw that ""The Final Break"" was included I was able to cancel the separate Blu-ray before it was shipped.
Part of the problem, if you haven't had this happen to you before, is that the separate single Blu-ray is listed in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section making you think you need to buy that too to complete your collection.
Interestingly, this exact same thing happened to me recently with amazon's dvds of The Munsters TV show. The season two dvd package now includes an extra dvd of the two movies ""Munsters, Go Home"" and ""Munsters Revenge."" That two movie dvd is also available separately and also listed in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section. And, the season two listing does not say that this extra dvd is included. Of course, amazon gave me a fast refund, so no big deal for me. Just wanted to let everybody know about this situation so you can look out for it in the future.",1448236800,7,1507,4.564575645756458

3864467,5,B0027CSMXG,"If I were rating this show merely on the quality of the actual show - I'd give it five stars as well. But this review is for the actual physical product.

For the price they are charging, this product is WELL worth it. For one, it's on blu-ray. For two, it also contains the 'Final Break' in addition to the four seasons.

I've seen this show at Walmart recently by individual seasons on regular DVD selling for $13 each. Add that up and you'd pay $65 for standard DVD at Walmart, no less. Sure it's more expensive elsewhere. Add to the fact that this set is blu-ray and you'd easily be paying around $100 at Walmart IF they sold the blu-ray which they don't (at least I haven't seen it).",1438214400,6,688,4.2846153846153845

3864677,5,B0027CSMXG,This was just what I ordered. Very happy with purchase. I would recommend this to any one that likes Prison Break.,1359072000,,114,4.476190476190476
3864678,5,B0027CSMXG,"It's been many years since I have since a show that I just couldn't wait to see the next episode. The writer's are brilliant, all the actors were fantastic!!!! I really can not write in words just how much I enjoyed it. I made my son & his girlfriend watch two episodes - and they were HOOKED! They took the whole series home with them and had a Prison Break marathon. I highly recommend this series.",1358985600,,400,4.276315789473684
3864679,5,B0027CSMXG,"After seeing the first couple episodes, I had to buy the whole series.  The characters (good and bad) are addicting to watch, as are the complex and stressful situations they get into. There are so many twists that I never know what's coming, and I love it- more than I ever have another show.",1356393600,,293,4.425925925925926
3864680,5,B0027CSMXG,Excellent series and keeps you interested through the entire show.  The actors and actresses are fabulous and so believable to the theme of the series.,1355875200,,151,5.04
3864681,5,B0027CSMXG,"The rather cliche laden title: ""Prison Break"" may turn off some viewers who will not watch this series and, boy, these viewers will miss arguably the best American t.v. series ever. The series manages the virtual impossible in either movies or t.v. films: it blends action, strong characters (and complex characterization), very fine acting, a few compelling themes and  an extremely well-written series, the writing of which seemed to have stimulated excellent direction and, as stated above, very good acting. Wentworth Miller,the actor playing the series's protagonist, seems to have come out of nowhere, unless he acted in plays of which this writer is ignorant. His t.v. and movie resume was and still is very thin. Yet he makes a difficult acting assignment seem like the proverbial ""walk in the park."" Other characters are equally well acted. The show is fiction but the versimilitude quotient is very high--genius i.q. of a show.
  Many reviews, quite wrongly in my opinion, believe the series worsens after the first season. I feel the opposite. The show continues its excellence from first episode to last. One problem I am having is finding the episode that contains the real final ending to the show, which is quite well done and legitimately evokes genuine sentiment. I rarely buy dvd's of shows that I can still access without the purchase. But this is the one show worth having your own copy. I have a large library of books, but few dvds or video recordings. I highly recommend watching this show, whether or not you purchase your own copy. Many films advertise themselves as having fine action coupled with deeper thematic elements--this is one series that surpasses any hype the show might engender.",1346371200,4,1717,5.017543859649122
3864682,5,B0027CSMXG,THIS IS THE BEST TV SERIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED.  I AM JUST NOW WATCHING IT ON HULU PLUS AND I WISH I HAD WATCHED IT BEFORE NOW.  i do agree that the show is better when you can watch all 4 seasons at one time.  Highly recommend this.. i am even buying the series on dvd so i can go back and watch it over!!,1341360000,,306,3.606060606060606
3864683,5,B0027CSMXG,"If you haven't seen Prison Break yet, you're missing out. Great acting, great cast, great story plot, great great great!",1333152000,,120,5.05
3864684,5,B0027CSMXG,"My husband and I started watching the re-run series of Prison Break on Netflix. My husband, who is much more particular about tv shows and movies, was totally into it from the very beginning. Usually I pick what we watch. But with Prison Break he is asking to watch it. Because it was near his birthday, I purchased through Amazon, the entire series and the movie that came out after that we didn't even know about.

The show is exciting, intriging and thoroughly entertaining. Always leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The charachters have interesting layers to their pasts and you find yourself liking  or at least having sympathy for a charachter, whom you previously despised. The acting is good, the storyline is great. And yes, I like the show too!

Currently we are on Season 3. We look forward to the rest of it.",1332374400,2,830,4.594594594594595

3864717,5,B0027CSMXG,"I am not going to try to fit everything I want to say about this series in this review.  Well written, great acting,and great characters.  It was filled with drama, suspense, comedy, and plenty of non stop action!  Michael, Lincoln, Fernando, Alex, Sara, Theodore aka T-Bag, C-Note, are just some of the characters that make this series strong.  I watched it on Netflix which was a good, yet bad thing.  The problem was that I did not want to stop watching & missed out on some sleep!  Each episode had a cliff hanger.  The series had me on edge from start to finish.  I did not want the series to end!",1322524800,7,602,4.36036036036036
3864718,5,B0027CSMXG,"I just finished watching the last of the four seasons of Prison Break and the quality and condition was excellent! I have ordered season sets of other products before, and there has always been a problem with at least one disk. This set was perfect in every way... delivery time, packaging, and quality! If you are a Prison Break fan, this is the set to purchase! I also suggest that you order the corresponding movie. It made the Prison Break experience all that much better!",1320969600,,476,4.6117647058823525

3864722,5,B0027CSMXG,"There are very few shows out there that keep you on the edge of your seat from episode to episode. Prison Break is one of those shows. I never saw it on TV and I am quite glad. The suspense and waiting would have driven me nuts. I would have gone insane waiting week to week for the next episode and seasons 1 and 2 end with you wanting to yell at the screen because the season is over. Fortunately, with this set, you can simply pop in the next DVD and keep watching.

Michael Schofield is like the modern day MacGuyver. Just when you think he's outsmarted, you realize that he planned for that eventuality and already adjusted for it. This show also makes you want to cheer for the prisoners (most of whom deserve to be in prison). Schofield's brother, Lincoln Burrows is on death row for a murder he did not commit. You can guess that Schofield's goal is to break him out. The plan seems simple enough but naturally, he finds himself in a lot more than he ever expected (hence the series going on for 4 seasons). I won't get into too much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but this is a great show, from start to finish. There are a number of people who say that the show should have ended after season 2, if not season 3 but I did enjoy season 4.",1282348800,4,1289,4.156
3864723,1,B0027CSMXG,"Purchased this series last Sept. and am just now beginning to watch it. It would be very enjoyable except about half the disks are damaged.

3864724,5,B0027CSMXG,"Prison break is a good show... as long as you have an imagination.  Completely unrealistic, lots of twists and turns, but always exciting.  I watched the entire series and I would watch it again.",1271376000,,195,4.705882352941177
3864725,5,B0027CSMXG,"I bought this package when it was 95 bucks, it's a shame the price was raised.

Great show, the price is still good for all the discs you get considering that each season is between 40 and 50 bucks sold separately.

My discs for the last season didn't come with Spanish subtitles. That was very important for me.",1265932800,,312,4.362068965517241
