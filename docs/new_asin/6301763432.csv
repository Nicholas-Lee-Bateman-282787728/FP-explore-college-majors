7815452,5,6301763432,"What can I say about American Ninja 2 that hasn't been said before? `camp', `awful', `I haven't seen a girl naked' were the reviews when it went straight to video.

This winner of the coveted 'Campest Movie Award 1987' is a modern celluloid classic that ranks up there with the Godzilla films for depth, plot and mad ninja skillz, its obvious when viewing that Stevie Wonder was in charge of the camerawork with direction from David Hasselhoff, special effects are clearly done by Budget On A Shoestring Inc.

Watch in awe as a non descript ninja gets a beating, choke as you drive an oil tanker through the gaping holes in the script, look away in disgust as a burly Marine gets his USMC issued dress tunic ripped and torn off him in an homo-erotic struggle inside a drinking establishment, cry with joy when the heroes finally defeat the enemy and high 5 each other at the same time complementing each other physiques with a friendly bit of banter such as `you been working out?'.  A bit like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but with beer bosoms.

It makes you want to complete your degree in Movie Buffology.",1119312000,,1110,4.619289340101523
