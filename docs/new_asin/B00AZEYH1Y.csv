8559575,5,B00AZEYH1Y,"Great film that shows that in some cultures woman are viewed as objects- to be traded, discarded, mistreated and disfigured. These women, although disfigured, are role models of strength and support each other emotionally and spiritually. The plastic surgeon who volunteers to help these women become ""whole"" again is truly an angel although you can see and feel the emotional toll this takes on him.",1466553600,2,400,5.1692307692307695
8559576,5,B00AZEYH1Y,"I read the other reviews, who talk most about the horrors the women go through. And it is horrible.  For me though, I suffer through painful disabilities, what spoke most to me was the courage of the women who step forward.  The worst case, a woman who lost basically the left side of her face including not just her eye but her eye socket, was thrown acid on when she came out of the courthouse for applying for a divorce.  It took a very long time for her case to be bettered but the courage and dignity of her and the other woman the show really spoke to me.  If she can smile though her difficulties, I cannot help but try to match her.",1458000000,5,640,4.137096774193548

8559579,5,B00AZEYH1Y,"a stunning description of how the Women of Islam suffer.  A must see for anyone who is interested in human rights. In traditional Muslim societies women have few rights and few laws to protect them. Poor women are the most vulnerable. The film examines one kind of horror, but there are comparable horrors all over the world.",1387670400,3,325,4.701754385964913
8559580,5,B00AZEYH1Y,I screened this film for high school students taking my women's studies and feminism class. The 40 minute length of the film is perfect for screening in school. My students found the film a powerful component of our discussions of violence against women globally.,1382054400,,263,5.0
8559581,5,B00AZEYH1Y,"This is a film that everyone needs to see.

When it was first made, I saw a trailer for it and desperately wanted to watch it, but I have never seen it anywhere to actually WATCH, so I ordered it.
Shipping was prompt, package arrived intact and undamaged.

The content of the film just blew my mind. It was even better than I expected it to be. It will shock you, stun you, break your heart, and raise an unfathomable anger within you. It will make you cry.

It is also the most beautiful thing I've ever watched, just as full of hope as it is pain.",1369785600,6,549,4.11214953271028
8559582,5,B00AZEYH1Y,"I really enjoyed the video, I actually purchased this movie because of a research paper at my school. I would recommend this documentary to everyone because people need to be aware of the barbaric issues women face do to  violence in their country.",1367452800,3,248,4.767441860465116
