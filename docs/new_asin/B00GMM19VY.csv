6086944,4,B00GMM19VY,American Experience does it again! Another educational program that brings our history alive while providing a snap shot into the early development of forensic science. Not to be skipped.,1393891200,,187,5.482758620689655
6086945,4,B00GMM19VY,"Well presented overview of the beginning of forensic science/medicine in the US!  You may be surprised at what you don't know. This offers a glimpse into an era of changing attitudes about 'cause of death' and the system of political appointees that had no knowledge of medicine. Alexander Gettler was a man that wanted answers about a subject that was not well understood. His ability to isolate poisons and to create techniques that gave exacting answers offered credibility to a new form of science. Recommended viewing . . . learn what you might not understand about government agencies that are intended to keep people, at home or in the workplace, safe. Well worth the time even for those of us who already know the information. PBS docudrama at it's best!

6086947,5,B00GMM19VY,"I just watched this today and I was floored. A fascinating look at Depression Era America related to crime and poisonings. You might think that this doesn't sound very interesting but trust me, this is riveting drama. The two main characters show fortitude and determination to advance their field of science. Would we be where we are today without their pioneering work? Perhaps, most would say probably. But someone has to lead because everyone can't be a follower and I thank our lucky stars that we had two individuals as dedicated as this to take point. Bravo American Experience! Great show!",1391558400,,597,4.920792079207921
6086948,4,B00GMM19VY,"This was a fascinating look at our country's early self-experimentation with chemicals, the devastating consequences that sometimes followed and forensic science's attempt to keep up.",1391040000,,183,6.36
6086949,5,B00GMM19VY,"This was a wonderfully done documentary. It explores the pioneering work of Charles Norris (medical examiner) and Alexander Gettler (toxicologist). Viewers are transported to a time period when chemistry and science began to take a more prominent role in forensics. The element that makes this documentary so compelling is that it shares Norris and Gettler's story in the context of historical events that took place during the time period when they conducted their work. There are also some reenactments and real photos to give viewers more context. After watching this documentary, viewers are educated about forensics and American history",1389312000,14,641,5.484848484848484

6086951,5,B00GMM19VY,"I am an AVID documentary watcher. Any kind really, as long as its interesting to be honest. This one was really interesting. Only problem was I started it at night and then I had to go to bed but I wanted to finish it! Start this when you have the time too, it will really pull you in. It is also very educational and not in a YOU MUST LEARN! kind of way. It shows how two people see the world before their time and now they want to shape it for the better good. For the future of the American people. Even in the documentary says that doesn't mean what their dream turned into doesn't make huge mistakes or is wrong. FDA * cough* but the protection of the people should be one of the governments top priorities.  Though again in today's climate and whose our so called president that all changed. Anyway I Would and probably will watch again.",1518566400,,843,4.236024844720497

6086972,5,B00GMM19VY,"I thought this was going to be simply about solving murders, and it is, but it is far more than that as they go through the life experiences of a New York toxicologist starting in the 1920s solving mysterious deaths for over 75 years. In the beginning science was little understood in the court room but by the end of his career if the toxicologist showed up at court it was all over with. You were either guilty or innocent based on his testimony.",1514419200,,448,4.345238095238095
6086973,5,B00GMM19VY,"First of all, there is NOTHING that I liked the least about this film! It was AMAZING and taught me SO much about the history of forensic science and the art of toxicology. I have always been intrigued by crime scene investigating, but they only had to examine the body of the deceased to solve these crimes.
Also, how AWFUL was prohibition! A country trying to poison most of its citizens. Terrible people.",1513468800,,407,4.589041095890411

6086975,5,B00GMM19VY,"This was a great documentary. Throughout the entire episode my wife and I were glued to the TV. Coming from a chemistry background, it was nice seeing how New York solved cases using their new toxicology department using chemistry techniques we were taught in college, science that was new and just getting started back in the 30's. The history of NY and how they grew their ME's office over the course of 40 years was very interesting. I was extremely happy to have found this.",1511740800,,478,4.635294117647059
6086976,5,B00GMM19VY,"Very well-made documentary, I like how they try to illustrate the chemical tests as close as possible. I have to be honest that this documentary motivates me to finish my phd despite feeling down with failed experiments. It really takes perseverance to do good work like Alexander Gettler.",1511308800,,289,5.041666666666667

6087038,5,B00GMM19VY,"Although now the sort of thing I normally watch, the Poisoner's Handbook is a fascinating program, set in the early years of forensics work when the job of coroner was just another lucrative job to be handed out for political favors. New York City really pioneered the scientific approach to studying the dead in order to determine the cause of their demise. This documentary looks at several ""chapters,"" each defined by a specific case and a specific poison. It really keeps you interested and the twist at the end is a very nice touch. Very well done.",1446076800,,553,4.711340206185567
6087039,5,B00GMM19VY,Amazing. This documentary is eerie and at the same time very informing.  I like stories about forensic detective work and how it is used to track down killer. But what do you do when the killer is the U.S. government?  This story makes me very grateful that I live in an era where chemicals are regulated and the Medical Examiners office (in most states) is responsible and works to resolve mysteries.  Very Good movie. I highly recommend it.,1445904000,,442,4.641025641025641

Described through the history of forensic science and chemical analysis, not only to solve crime, but to hunt down the hidden dangers of everyday living.  One other take away, early 20th century city living is definitely far more dangerous than I could have ever imagined.",1445558400,,345,5.142857142857143

6087044,5,B00GMM19VY,"This was an excellent history into how the understanding of how much times have changed. Society takes ""household"" toxins more seriously.

This is very interesting and entertaining.",1445212800,,368,5.589285714285714
6087045,5,B00GMM19VY,"An excellent documentary on the origin of CSI in the early 1900's. Two issues were the problem, corruption and the newness of the science. It seems that the job of coroner was a political appointment that anyone could have which lead to corruption. Poisons were household items that were very easy to get. Expert testimony was inaccurate at best. Two men worked in tandem to solve this in NY city. The documentary tells a fascinating story using real cases to show how CSI became the gold standard.",1445040000,4,498,4.735632183908046

6087047,5,B00GMM19VY,I had no knowledge of Dr Getler and Dr Norris and their contribution to public health.,1444780800,,86,4.4375
6087048,5,B00GMM19VY,"This documentary weaves a biography into the context of New York politics, social mores and science. I was spellbound from the very beginning, but the main reason why I rated this so highly is I dug into a few sources after I watched it and it was substantially factual with no exaggerations. It's rare to have a documentary that is so compelling that is not embellished in some way.

There are actually two main characters whose biographies are address: Doctor Charles Norris, the NYC medical examiner and his chief toxicologist Alexander Gettler.

There would have been no story without Norris, but Gettler's role is the real focus. Norris is responsible for totally changing the way law enforcement in New York approached investigations - and that approach spread to nearby cities and states. Gettler's genius as a chemist and his innovations in forensics with respect to poisoning is the real focus, but Gettler is but one reason why Norris himself was so successful. For one thing Gettler had the latitude to pursue and develop a lot of that is the foundations of his area of forensics because Norris handled the politics and also had the overarching vision. That is not to diminish Gettler's role or his truly significant contributions. I just want to point out that while Gettler is the main focus, there is a larger story.

I love the example cases that were used to illustrate Gettler's genius and integrity. That, like the rest of the documentaty, are presented in context of social, legal, political (to some degree) and scientific factors. That is what makes this such a fascinating story. The acting and even the cinematography are also exceptional. You feel as though you are in the periods represented and are interacting with the principals.

If you love CSI, science or just have an inquisitive mind you will love this!",1444348800,,1836,4.912903225806452
6087049,5,B00GMM19VY,"I really enjoyed this presentation.  It was interesting to see the progression of toxicology from not being a forefront of police investigation to being the key to solving many crimes now-a-days.  For anyone interested in forensics, learning about Dr. Gettler is key!  Great documentary!",1444176000,,287,5.4772727272727275

There was a lot of history told.  I'm not a history buff, but found this very intriguing and informative.  Which brings us to the 3rd level (history related), it just goes to show that history repeats itself over and over: politics, money, and self interest continue to rise above many people's ethics.

I watched it again with my boyfriend and enjoyed it all over.

6087093,4,B00GMM19VY,"Enjoyable and educational story of the life work of New York's first medical examiner Charles Norris, and his head toxicologist Alexander Gettler. Before Norris, New York coroners (as in many places) weren't doctors, and often had absolutely no scientific training. It was more a give-away, political patronage job, and forensic evidence wasn't taken very seriously by juries, judges, or lawyers.

But Norris and Gettler dragged New York, and ultimately the rest of the U.S., into the age of science in the courtroom. For this show it specifically focuses on the issue of poisonings and how Gettler and Norris got ever better at exposing the truth behind these killings  to the point where intentional poisonings in New York went from hundreds of cases a year to only one or two. That's how good they were. It was no longer worth the risk.

Unlike most American Experience films, this relies heavily on reenactments. That usually means cheesy and unimpressive. But here the acting is first rate, and it makes the device work surprisingly well. One could imagine a fascinating series about these two  a sort of real life Holmes and Watson.",1417478400,,1138,5.005291005291006

It also helps that I've read the book form by the same name (which is ever so wonderfully accessible on Amazon in Kindle and other formats).

I spent many long hours absorbed by the book, the history and cases and gradually progressive movements into the formation of modern forensics and toxicology. The cases mentioned in the movie are all listed in the book with a wealth of minute and fascinating details that aren't exactly touched on in the movie, and the book has even more cases and substances to read about. But not only is it (both book and movie) a history of the blooming forensics field, it's a also an mid-depth history of the early decades of the 1900's and the transition of society from the 20's onward, going from Prohibition and its repeal, the beginnings of the Second World War, how the many different levels of NY society lived and worked in these times, as well as how the standards of manufacturing, drug/product testing, and safety procedures were informed, updated and implemented.

I would say that if you have any interest in the science fields such as medicine, forensics, toxicology, chemistry or biology, this is just one of those movies (and books) that will truly satisfy you. Please, look at both and decide for yourself!",1414800000,3,1416,4.871369294605809

8624697,5,B00GMM19VY,"-This is an absolutely riveting portrayal of the infancy  and growth  of the field of criminal forensic medicine....Utilizing reenactments, old footage, and newspapers and court documents, this program traces the growing influence of science in criminal law, focusing on some of the most horrifically difficult who-dun-its, in the process....

-Above all, it is the story of the absolute dedication of a handful of individuals who were determined to end the system of, Its-Who-You-Know-That-Determines-Your-Guilt-Or-Innocence......Absolutely engrossing documentary. Highly recommended.....",1524960000,,589,6.623376623376624

8624699,5,B00GMM19VY,"Every time I play this for a visiting friend, they think it's something they've already seen, or that it will be boring.  But once the program begins, they remain glued to their seats until the very end.  This is not a story, it's a history, and a very interesting history, too.",1522108800,,278,4.431372549019608

8624702,4,B00GMM19VY,"While Norris and Gettler are stellar people, it should have been pointed out in this documentary that not all forensic science today has a solid base in science.  The National Academies of Science in 2010 published findings that many forensic science disciplines presented in courtrooms are not reliable, such as bite marks and tool marks.  This was a starting point for making the full range of forensic analyses actually science-based, but the funds for doing so have been cut off by the Trump administration.",1519171200,,511,5.071428571428571
