8436479,5,B000KK9LTQ,"My daughter is on a youth cheer squad. This DVD is perfect. She loves the routines. She does them alone and with her friends. They're fun and the instruction is fabulous with the Cheeracise instructional flip. I've never seen that before and makes learning the dances easier. The plyometrics is great for her legs. Helps her stretch and strengthen. To tell you the truth, I've joined her a couple of times. My legs feel pretty good after that workout. I recommend this to any girl who cheers or wants to cheer and for any mom who needs to give a good gift too.",1175299200,2,560,4.446601941747573
8436480,4,B000KK9LTQ,This is great! I love that it teaches fast but it uses current music and that you can catch on pretty quickly. It offers great hints on how to stay in shape and look your best. I use this for my squad and for myself. My shoulders already feel this as an asset to my workout.,1170028800,2,274,3.9107142857142856
