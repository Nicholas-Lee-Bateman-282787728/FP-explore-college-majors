7976138,4,B00007G22T,"while i am not a fan of scott cole, he seems to have gotten better choreography for the cardio/aerobics part. not nearly as silly as the abs of steel for men tape. i don't really feel anything in the abs as i am working out with this tape, but i notice my entire mid-section seems a bit tighter after following along with the two shirtless wonders (i forget the other guy's name) on this tape. the workout seems a bit disorganized with some of the more complex moves being hard to follow due to them not demonstrating slowly enough. i would say this is not a workout for total beginners. that meaning someone who is newly off the couch who has never worked out before. but overall it's a good workout. i already do a lot of the moves they show with my kickboxing workout so nothing too new here. i do like the idea of working out the abs by doing standing workout. sometimes you just need to be off the mat.",1123545600,5,907,4.2485549132947975
