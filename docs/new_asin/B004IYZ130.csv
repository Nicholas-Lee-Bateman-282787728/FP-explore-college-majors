8431377,1,B004IYZ130,"This DVD is really worth nothing.
The various stories told in this dvd is pure invention based on the falsified narratives and stories of the christian ""historian"" Pavstos Byuzand and Gregory Partev's private ""historian"" Agatangeghos.

Ararat has nothing in common with zion.
Armenians have nothing in common with jews (except that the first christian high priests and preachers were all either jewish or other assyrian semites).

This whole thing is a fabrication.

After the 301 CHRISTIAN GENOCIDE perpetrated by Gregory Partev of Persia, the entire Armenian History has been re-written by radical christian historians.
They tried hard to burn the whole of Armenia's anciant history going back thousands of years. But thanks to Movses Khorenatsi and other honest historians the history of Armenia is now resurging and ready to be digged in by true scientists.

So, please do not buy this falsification of facts!",1356307200,,913,5.319444444444445
8431378,5,B004IYZ130,"For those interested in a truly spiritual quest to holy places, while learning history, and while visiting amazing landscapes and understanding the real meaning of divine inspiration, then this would be the film for you.

Through the story of close to two millenia of the perilous journeys of Armenian pilgrims to the Holy Land, this film manages to shine the spotlight on the greatness of our spirit.

The production quality is top notch.  The documentary material research second to none.  The narration is unbelievable.

If you want to understand that the real divinity in us is a powerful uniting force through our common human experience, then you will appreciate owning this DVD.  The only thing that can top its experience, is retracing the footsteps of the filmmakers and actually visiting these miraculous places on your own.

It will make an excellent addition to your DVD collection.  It would be even better if you got a copy for your local school or public library.",1322438400,2,978,4.957055214723926
