8219931,4,B000VTJ13W,"Hey, I have been teaching guitar now for 24 years and this book is a good choice for day one beginners.  There are alot of duets and I find that it is best in the early stages for students to not play duets since another guitar playing something different can be distracting.

There are plenty of basic melodies and chord songs.  Make sure you are working everything to a metronome.
