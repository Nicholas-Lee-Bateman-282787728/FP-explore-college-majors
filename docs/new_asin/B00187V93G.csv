8268825,1,B00187V93G,"Leon (Michael Harris) and Rodney (Randy Clarke)are two young men who want money, but don't want jobs. Whatever money they can get hold of, the spend at a strip club, going so far as taking in their change jar. Rather than get a job to pay for their habit, they opt to start their own strip club in Rodney's parent's garage irregardless of any licensing or zoning issues. Rodney's parents are charging him for rent and every meal. Leon has gambling debts.

They hold auditions and get four slightly handicapped women apply for the jobs. One has Tourettes Syndrome, one has a wooden leg, one has a voice box and another is narcoleptic. The acting was bad from beginning to end. The film is cheesy and is designed to be cheesy. In spite of that, it failed to deliver one good laugh. Not worth watching or reviewing. I'm sorry I did both.

8268827,1,B00187V93G,"Bad comedies are the worst type of bad movies to suffer through. Bad horror, bad action, bad fantasy and bad sci-fi can be enjoyable in their badness(so bad its good) but I have yet to see a bad comedy with that redeeming factor. That much being said this is the lamest attempt at comedy that I have seen all year and is definitely on my list of bad movies. The whole story is some punk kid(I don't know his name and I really don't care) gets harassed by his over-the-top stereotypical mother and father to get out of the house and get a job so he and his friend come up with an idea that to run a strip club out a basement. So they hire a group of mentally and physically handicapped women to work for them.

Opinion: Read the so-called plot again and you'll realize why it sucks. This movie is not only conscious of it being low budget but the people in this ""movie"" act act just like people in a low budget comedy would act. The attempts at humor are pathetic and everybody in this movie is a caricature. You got the stereotypical strict black parents who act like fools, you got the two boys that this ""film"" is centered around who act like black versions of Tweedledumb and Tweedledumberer. The strippers are as follows: a Hispanic with Tourette's syndrome, one Caucasian with a hole in her throat and talks through those electronic devices, one attractive black girl with a peg leg and another atractive black girl who sleeps a lot. I can see why they chose these girls to be strippers. They're perfect! Look, Im not expecting top notch acting from a low budget comedy but at least put some effort into what you do. This film just plops itself on the screen and stays there for an hour and 40 minutes with nothing funny happening. This movie is not even fun to pick apart and makes Soul Plane look like a classic.",1219190400,2,1819,4.381656804733728
8268828,4,B00187V93G,If you are into low budget hood comedies than this is for you. This funnier than some of the big budget movie I've seen this year. Don't go in  expecting great acting and you'll find your self laughing a lot at this movie.,1217721600,2,222,4.162790697674419
