8256207,5,B0014SBZYM,"As a First Class Fire Control Technician on the USS Georgia SSBN 729 (Blue) I was an uncredited extra while acting as the assistant Public Affairs Officer (PAO) to Lt. John Zimmerman (credited) when the Discovery Channel filmed our crew for the Sharks of Steel series. I am seen jumping through a hatch in the first few seconds of the first episode while Capt. Razz (credited) was speaking. The director watched me do this jumping through during a transition period of filming and decided to add it to the opening sequence!

It was hard work, but I really enjoyed the process and the resulting videos.  Talking to Adm. Kaufman, the sponsor for this project and Naval Academy instructor, was also very informing!  I also enjoyed working with the film and support crews during this effort, and would gladly do it again!",1470614400,,817,4.780141843971631
8256208,5,B0014SBZYM,Great videos.  Especially cool to see my husband in quite a few of the shots.,1431302400,,77,4.133333333333334
8256209,4,B0014SBZYM,Really a great set and being a submariner I find it actuate for the time frame. I like the fact that the documentary is non bias and covers all the big countries. Even through there are more it is still a great set,1383177600,,214,4.0
8256210,5,B0014SBZYM,"I first saw this documentary on the Discovery Channel. Most of what is contained in the four-disc set was compressed into a two-hour segment but I have to say that with this DVD set you get to go deeper into the world of the submariner. It's an illusive way of life for only a select few in the military, but in today's volatile climate of global instability, very necessary!  The documentary explores the history of submarine warfare during the cold war and up to present day of keeping a watchful eye on America's silent and deadly foes under the sea.  With in-depth interviews of experts as well as, past and present submariners, you get a real sense of what life is really like onboard some of the world's most powerful war ships.  I would highly-recommend this DVD set to anyone interested in submarine service.",1370390400,,816,4.652777777777778
8256211,5,B0014SBZYM,"I was serving in the US Naval Submarine Service when this was released. Even then, I considered this a good documentary exploring the little known world of submarine service. And even after all those years, it is still relevant. Granted, the Navy has seen quite a few changes since I served, but much of the human aspect remains consistent. Anyone interested in military history & culture, especially if those interests focus on submarines, this is a good watch. There are, indeed, newer documentaries, but not many as detailed.",1368662400,5,528,5.011363636363637
8256212,5,B0014SBZYM,"If you are a military buff and esp like naval warfare, then this DVD may interest you. Very well done",1367798400,,101,4.1
8256213,5,B0014SBZYM,"I bought this to replace my VHS cassette version, hoping that this will last longer and be playable when VCRs are out. It appears to be good quality, although I haven't played all 4 DVDs. I am satisfied.",1352592000,,203,4.368421052631579
8256214,5,B0014SBZYM,"Recorded this on VHS when it was 1st released but, the VHS copy does not do it any justice. Watched all the DVD's
in one night. Being I am a  Navy Vet, I had to have this in my collection.",1344384000,,188,3.7
8256215,4,B0014SBZYM,I saw this some years ago and thought it a great one size fits all (almost) documentary about submarines and submariners. I wore out my VHS tv recording and was so happy at seeing it on amazon that I bought it straight away. Time hasn't dented my satisfaction with this programme. I recall there was another great programme called SUBMARINE (I think ) by the BBC (where else of course) which would be a great companion piece to this - but anyway - full marks to Scott Hicks for making a programme that to me would appeal to the wife as much as the husband - while getting into useful detail - but not too much - about what makes a submarine and the men within tick. I wish they would release more of his work. Anyone remember his excellent programme on the Chinese army just post Tienamin Square - WALL OF IRON?,1326672000,3,811,4.30718954248366
