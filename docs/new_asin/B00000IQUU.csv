They should've ended the film with a good fight scene but they drove a car off a bridge to end the movie. It seems as thought they were trying to make this like a Die Hard in space. The film suffers in two ways: 1) Speakman needed more fight scenes. 2) Speakman is so bland and doesn't  show any emotions, he has the same expression in every scene. He needed to try harder to act in his scenes. Speakman has more to do here than in The Gunman and he is the hero of the film. However, this is definitely not as entertaining as his earlier films like Street Knight. There is no sex, nudity or profanity in this film.",1485388800,,705,4.1838235294117645

7911466,2,B00000IQUU,"This is a sci-fi movie about an unusual team of people hired to go up and investigate an abandoned spaceship.  However, as they reveal what happened, they also find out that someone among them is behind all of it.  Intriguing?  Mildly.  Overdone?  Probably.  The main reason to see this movie is for Jeff Speakman.  Jeff Speakman is a Kenpo Karate expert, who has sadly done many bad films in his career.  However, if you like to see martial arts action, you may like to see this movie.  Toward the end, Jeff gets a fight scene in which he gets to crazy against his opponenet.  I think Jeff has some of the fastest hands in the martial arts movie world.  I dare say that he is faster than Jackie Chan, and maybe even Jet Li.",996969600,5,724,4.3283582089552235
