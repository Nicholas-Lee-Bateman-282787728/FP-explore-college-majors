8560440,3,B000HD1MZC,This is a very informative video! If your child is a new player this video goes over the basic skills for all the positions! It teach some basic drills for each position for your child to practice and master basic football skills. You may have to watch it the first time with your child as it uses football terminology but doesn't always explain them completely. Not a difinative guide by any means but a good place to start teaching the skills for a first year player.,1182643200,6,469,4.465116279069767
