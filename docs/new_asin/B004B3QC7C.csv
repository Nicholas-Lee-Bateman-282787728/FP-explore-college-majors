8421473,5,B004B3QC7C,"This is a wonderful tribute to one of Baseball's finest players and most sterling characters.  The testimonials are well done, and it reminds you of a time when character was an important trait in life.  Sadly, as we 'progress,' Gil Hodges has been forgotten by baseball, but Marino Amoruso is one who's doing his best to ensure Hodges will be remembered.  Not just for his feats on the ball field, but for his leadership abilities.  Well done and a fine tribute.",1433289600,,463,4.679012345679013
