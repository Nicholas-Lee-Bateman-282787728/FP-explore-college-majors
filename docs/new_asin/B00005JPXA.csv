1574366,5,B00005JPXA,"There are so many nasty comments about this before it even comes out, what kind of people want to attack ideas before they even know what they are?

I wanted to see this movie ever since I have seen the previews of it almost a year ago.

This movie follows in the format of the documentary ""The Corporation"" in that is has brief interview excerpts from lots of very bright people all talking about what humanity is doing to the Earth.

One focus in on temperature.  Global Warming, Climate Change call it what you will, the concensus is explained to people in a way non-scientists can understand by scientists.  One example is how the polar ice caps function to reflect some of the heat radiation from the Sun away from Earth out into space.  As we warm the planet the polar ice caps melt and we lose this balance so that not only do we not reflect heat to space, we actually absorb more heat causing a positive feedback look. This system can push us past a tipping point from our nice comfortable zone of termperate stability into an unknown weather system that could conceivably take up to the extreme of our other to solar neighbors, Mars or Venus.

Another focus of this movie is human population which we all know is a problem.  The problem is explored in terms of the net energy use by our species and the need to ""mine"" stored solar energy in the form of oil/coal since we surpassed the number of humans the Earth can comfortably support living on current solar energy the way we used to live in non-technological times.

Then some solutions are explored, and new terminology is explained.  I have been familiar with these ideas and terms for a long time, but I was glad to see a well done popular explanation of them in documentary form that was not a political diatribe and in fact almost had a spiritual twist to it.  Because that is what is going to be needed because as most scientists agree not only are we in the 11th hour, we are at the 59th minute of that hour and counting.

Humanity has to move fast, and it has to do something it has never done before and may not be capable of doing, and that is to change our nature and act like the intelligent creatures we purport to be rather than the unthining animals who foul their nests and destroy their habitat.",1188518400,13,2274,4.413875598086125
1574367,5,B00005JPXA,"THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER GLOBAL WARMING FILM...so let's start there!
THIS IS NOT AL GORE,DEMOCRAT or REPUBLICAN...so let's say that!
THIS IS NOT A BASHING FILM...so there is no excuse for anyone to not see it!

Anyone who follows the current trends in weather patterns,global warming,greenhouse gases and has seen  2006's Oscar winning AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH will not be a stranger to a lot of the material presented in this expertly crafted semi-doc narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio. What sets this film apart from it's predecessor is that real concrete solutions are brought to us and a great deal of the film concerns itself with renewable energy possibilities that are quite encouraging and challenging. If you want to do something more than what you have already done, then this film is for you. If you are a skeptic,go see it anyway and maybe this time you might be convinced that something IS terribly array with The Earth.

Yes, I am as ""green"" as I have been able to be in the last year (which has done wonders for pocketbook and self esteem!). This film takes you even further. If the future life of this planet is of any concern to you, THE 11TH HOUR will give you hope and determination to do all that you can reasonably do in order to hold back the hands of time from striking 12!We are the generation that can do something great instead of the generation that sees our planet extinguish itself.

1574544,3,B00005JPXA,"Rather disappointing overall. No one watching this will be swayed if they don't happen to believe humans are capable of effecting climate change. Keep in mind that most who reject that idea do so from a religious doctrine that says we are utterly incapable of doing so. This might be good to educate or introduce students to a topic they had not considered in depth before. The intended audience may even be young teenagers.
Just a few of the speakers offered insight that was informative or unique perspective. I understand that having all scientists from Stanford or Cambridge would make the discussion less accessible to the average or younger viewer, and it was supposed to appear as an everyman topic because it's an everyman problem (with or without an everyman solution). So in that aspect, though it made it less interesting or informative as far as I am concerned, it was nice to have random businesspeople and enviro-fans talk about loving the Earth. This was half stock-footage stark music video, half ominous finger wagging, and no one really likes to be scolded. One guy made the point that we're basically doing everything wrong. But don't despair viewers, that just means we have the opportunity to fix everything. Lucky us!

 Considering that humans are not apart from nature but a part of nature is something we should keep in mind. The way we deal with nature is a product of society (or culture as one guy said), because we deal with politics and consumerism. I'm sure we'd all love some Solar City roof shingles, since they're only going to cost what a normal roof costs, except if rumors are true, Musk's definition of normal roofs is 10x what a normal person's definition is ($10-15,000, not $100,000). Not that people need government subsidies, but as technology evolves it is adopted slowly as people learn about it or save money to afford it. Price decreases with demand and then supply increase and therefore improved means of production drive the price down so it becomes more accessible to a greater number of consumers. It's a little discomfiting to be lectured about my consumerism in a movie by one of the wealthiest people I've heard of, but I'll get over it. The psychologist was getting a little philosophical when he stated that humans are unfulfilled and that's why they shop. While he may be right, that is the basis for some religions, and ironically, the idea that religion as a goal itself has been surpassed by non-religion which may lead to the lack of fulfillment which drives some of that consumerism. I'd also suggest that spending is both power and expression, while we remain beasts of burden we have few ways to explore other aspects of our personalities, and with the removal of any significant binding moral or religious or scientific (or whatever) goal/theme, we have apathy and disillusionment. In some ways this video felt oddly un-scientific, so many speakers warned about the progress and acquisitive nature of humans, and how detrimental is has been to the environment, they seem to ignore the fact that those may also be the root of the solutions to our past mistakes, and that progress is not necessarily about a cessation of industrialization or a return to a certain perfect balance of human population to Earth creatures. Our desire for progress and growth won't allow us to head backward, no matter how many hippies say that's progress, but perhaps instead of hitting some upper limit of population which leads to some devastating event, such as human extinction, that growth will lead us over that boundary into, for instance, outer space? And the idea that humans, or human industrialization is (like) an infection on Earth? Well, there is a solution for that, but I don't think we'll get everyone to agree to it.
Because we're looking at the snapshot in time, post-industrial society that is learning to be more self-sustaining, we look back at times of less prosperity and realize a generation ago people had so much less and re-used so much more, we can imagine a future (right, we're the only species that can imagine and plan for the future!) where we produce enough for everyone and without much waste. We can look at resources as an equation, nothing is really destroyed, even if it disappears to the dump instead of the recycling facility. If we remove carbon from trees or oil and put it into the atmosphere, doesn't that sound like it might effect how something else would work? Like keeps a little more heat in, so ice melts a little more, sea levels rise a little, storms become a little stronger and faster and more frequent, deserts become a little wider and dryer and hotter? It's sort of math-like, we're just shifting variables around. It's not climate change that we debate whether it is or is not happening, it's following where the variables go and realizing that must alter the equation.

My rebuttals to individual speakers:
 Consumerism drives technology, which drives advancements in the quality and efficiency of technology from consumer pressure with consumer financial backing, which of course leads to the solutions that people are begging for. Frugality is not a goal you can place on an ever-growing human population, especially when that world has extremely varied levels of prosperity.
 Arguing for nature to be given legal rights is probably the type of ideological creativity that off-puts a lot of people from caring about environmental policy. While the idea is not repugnant, it certainly is probably not taken seriously by the average person at present. Perhaps we should be more concerned with the undue influence certain people with more self-interest than environmental interest have over environmental policy than whether or not nature gets to vote about its own future.
 The best advice from this movie, paraphrased from one expert: ""People ask me what they can do. I answer, want to do something?... Get involved."" That's not even a bunch of nothing, it's a very minuscule amount of nothing. Don't be so abstruse. Give practical everyday advice for the average person listening to you that they can achieve with their income, lifestyle, and amount of time available or when asked that question respond that you do not have any advice for them at this time.",1494547200,,6264,4.915879017013233

1574546,4,B00005JPXA,"""We are nature.""  I liked this statement.  I feel that in some parts they could have taken the video further.  In the book ""the lives of a cell,"" the author points out that the world would be one mass if not for our immune systems.  Everything in our universe runs on electricity.  This is even how we absorb nutrient, through potential difference of charges.  Also, energy is conserved.  So, when they mention us using up all the ancient sunlight, what they are talking about is pulling the carbon potential energy stored within the earth and putting it in the air, land and oceans.  I would like to have heard more about the science of it all.

They do mention that we are in danger of becoming like Venus, a gas planet where temperatures are 250 degrees and it rains sulfuric acid (the stuff morticians use to clean flesh off of dead bodies).  And, they talk about the global warming turning off the ocean's natural cleaning mechanism of cycling clean water from the bottom to the top of the ocean.  This would then leave us with stagnant, polluted water.
They do not mention what I have heard in other articles..that if the sea ice melts entirely we would experience a 250 foot  rise in ocean levels.

I think the only way to solve this problem is to encourage introspection and not tolerate oblivion.  It is a lot like rehabilitation for a drug addict. The only escape is to be made to think deeply.  For example, when a tree is cut down, to be made aware of how it has a 57000 gallon water storage capacity that will be lost forever.

I liked the psychologist's conclusion that our out of control consumerism is a response to the void left by the destruction of nature.

I would have appreciated more specific examples of destruction:

the garbage patch in the Pacific
the coal veins that are ignited to burn for thousands of years in response to coal mining- emitting toxic gases and carbon
Canada's cultivation of oil sands
Merkel turning a beautiful German town into a coal mine
Norway blowing up the top of a mountain to get tooth whitening minerals even though it pollutes the Fjords
the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef
the oil cultivation threatening the Amazon
The 9 toxic dumps in Italy that were run by the Mafia and not regulated by the government
The illegal dumping of fluids by cruise ships
The destruction of the bees by the cultivation of field corn to be used as ethanol
The destruction of amphibians which have been around for 400 million years and evolved into frogs, salamanders, etc 250 million years ago

One of the points that this program states is that we must raise our level of consciousness about the inter-connectivity of all life on our planet since all life as we know it is in the balance. We can't count on governments or politicians. We need every person on earth to understand the issues and to care about them. We all have to do what we can to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. There are many things we can do as individual's. We can all use stainless steel water bottles. We can recycle, reuse and reduce our waste. We can eat less or no meat. We can compost. And those are just a few of many things we, as individuals, can do.

Like in this documentary it said that there was something like 37 trucks of waste for 1 truckload of useful goods.  I really don't buy that for a second.

1575186,4,B00005JPXA,"Great idea.  Would have been more pertinent about 15 years ago.  Great starter  documentary for those who  may not know some of the things  the global warming signafies.  Leonardo is in it.  Great nature shots.  Cons:  We are not in the 11th hour.  Ecologically speaking it is 11:59 and a lot of information was not here that has to be and should have been.

1. The import of methane gas release as a cloud or overall was not mentioned.

2. the bleaker , yet potentially pertinent view point of Guy McPherson (""into the dark"") was not mentioned, specifically a number of important pieces of data he provides from several key documents from the UN to NASA recently released (2013) but actually written in 2007.

3. The FACT that methane releases have risen exponentially from occasional vents at 30 cm in the Arctic to some sited by NASA at 150KM across  in the Arctic

4. The import or meaning of our government using Haarp to try to stave off the effects of a depleted ozone layer by the use of chemical trailing applied by jets

5. the obvious problem with the modules of greed vs sustainability and why the factor of greed not only trumps doing anything but why we will fail due to capitalism not having a paradigm for saving anything or conserving anything that interferes with making a buck.

The take away was that this was a great movie giving hope for the future if we take heed.  It is a public service blurb so that people like Leonardo can look like they did something meaningful.  We now know that the projections of rising seas and ice loss are WAAAAY behind the reality both in pace and scope and the idea that we have miles to go before we sleep and at least a few decades is also false.

We may have less than 2 decades at most (by the most conservative) with many saying we have less than 5-10 years.

but no one wants to do a movie about the 1 ""THEN WHAT"".  What happens if we continue apace (and we ARE continuing apace)

There is no movie that is telling the avg Joe who still thinks ""global warming means they will get to wear a sweater in the winter and have less snow to shovel"" ---there is NOTHING telling them that is global warming continues--you won't be here--no one will--no children or grandchildren or humans or very few  (actually none) and no animals.

There is no one telling the millions who have heard the term, debated the term, maybe even denied the term, that if we cannot stop this show, that in less than 50 years the planet for life as we know it goes extinct--not of a few species but perhaps as many as 95 to 99% and that includes humans.

No one is saying that in this so called, enlightening video and this inability to face this horrifying and most inconvenient truth is why we are continuing down the path of huge SUVs, and planning for a future when the signs are showing more and more that we may have actually less than 20 years before for mammalian existence, on this earth--there is NO LIFE at all.

It's like a Nature vid, with Leonardo cameo shots and great footage of ice falling and polar bears--but if you are a newbie it gives you a glimpse but it does nothing to tell the real story and so it plays like it is everyone else's problems and not those in the US Heartland or the mountains--because it FAILS to discuss the rising temperatures and the loss of all the green stuff like trees and grass which then renders starvation imminent and pesky things like breathing (what all the trees help us do) impossible.",1401667200,,3470,4.415094339622642
1575187,4,B00005JPXA,"This video is important because it shows how the biosphere is under multiple threats.  Therefore, only a broad based response will work.  It would be a problem if only global heating is occurring and excess coal is being burned, but when you combine that with continental scale tropical deforestation, then the natural brakes on carbon are impaired.  The same can be said of the ocean.  Fisheries can be part of the carbon cycle and provide long-term food supplies (see ""End of the Line"" film) but this is now at dire risk too (see ""Harvesting the Biosphere"" by Prof. Vaclav Smil).  The multitude of problems at first is saddening, but ultimately a call for strong action.  I would just like more bold solutions, not 10 or 20% changes in energy of food supplies.  Population is another challenge and either we share the planet with other life or we'll find most people fighting over scraps in a ""Mad Max"" world.",1400544000,4,911,4.727848101265823

Since its release we have had the BP disaster in the Gulf Coast, and a tremendous increase in fracking of oil and gas wells across the country contributing to the pollution of much of our ground water supply(and yes, earthquakes). Let's not forget the ongoing mountaintop removal operations in Appalacia. They won't stop till they've extracted every ounce of coal they can get out of that poor region of the country. Oh yea... There is that chemical spill last week that poisoned the water supply of 300,000 people in 9 counties of West -by-God Virginia. This also relatating to the coal extraction industry. It seems that every week I hear of another railroad tank car exploding while hauling oil from the Alberta Tar Sands across our country. Look for one coming through a town near you! That brings us to that infamous monster bearing down on us known as The Keystone Pipeline. Sorry, but I have every reason to believe that it will be approved. This film was done seven years ago and a lot has happened since then.....none of it good! This is but a short list of the environmental disasters that plague our planet.

I might add that among the steps we should take to respond to environmental degredation is to ask legislators to pass laws making it illegal for anyone to breach nature's laws.  Civil laws are necessary for a functioning society.  Nature comes with a system of laws that keep it life supporting.

The over-use of both renewable and nonrenewable resources is stressed, along with how much humans have changed entire surface of the earth. The ending provides the possibility of change, especially through the housing industry.
I would not recommend this movie as an informational documentary, because I did not find it very informative. The use of pathos arguments in the movie was distracting, and it became hard to distinguish between fact and opinions.

The multitude of Bill wannabes are not.
11th Hour refrains from hyperbole and heavy-handed far left propaganda. The cinematography is evocative. The mega slum sequences are especially memorable.

To be sure, the 11th hour was an interesting documentary of the effects of global warming.  However, much of what was stated in the video was nothing new.  One can get the same information after taking a geography course on global climate change.  What is the most disapointing feature is that it did not discuss in greater detail the politics of ecological destruction and the politics of capitalist ventures that prevents the possibility of an alternative future.  In fact, the 11th hour streamlined the environmental issue into a logical-positivist frame.

Finally, the solutions they offer to mitigate the ecological crisis is geared towards those who are privileged.  Where is this in the video?  I found it quite unfortunate that one of the biggest problems behind mobilizing the green revolution was not discussed--that the consolidation of power in the hands of the few prevents distributing the means for which mobilization can take place.  The environmental problem likes to pretend that it is not a class issue, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Proper education, affording organic products, making simple changes that reduce one's carbon foot print and so on are only available to those who have the time and money to do so.  I think this discussion needs to be situated within a Marxist orientation so that the problem of environmental disaster is more contextualized.",1299110400,6,1423,5.116883116883117

1575875,4,B00005JPXA,"A companion-piece of sorts to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" ""The 11th Hour"" is an informative and compelling documentary about the adverse impact humanity is having on the place we call home.

Written and directed by Leila Conners Petersen and Nidia Conners and produced and narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio, ""The 11th Hour"" shows how de-forestation, the polluting of the air and water, the over-consumption of fossil fuels, the overwhelming accumulation of waste, etc. are collectively contributing to the larger problems of global warming and climate change. It chronicles the impact such changes will have on the people of the planet, as widespread droughts, mega-storms and rising waters make themselves felt with ever-increasing frequency and force.

As the filmmakers see it, the root of the problem lies in the disconnect between humans and the environment, in our self-absorbed insistence that nature is ours to subdue and dominate, not to live in harmony with. In an ironic twist of fate, it is that very attitude that may well lead to our ultimate destruction. For it is plainly evident that in a battle between humans and the planet that sustains us, the planet will emerge victorious in the end.

After making its case on the scientific level, the movie then takes on the monetary and political forces that make addressing this issue so difficult to do on a practical basis. It goes after profit-driven multinational corporations - primarily the oil industry - for, essentially, buying politicians and, thus, effectively disenfranchising the everyday citizen and voter. But those citizens don't get off scot-free either, as the film makes the point that it is the near-universal obsession with rampant consumerism that greatly contributes to the problem.

The last third of the film is devoted to finding solutions to the problem, to designing and developing new technologies that will actually help to make it possible for us to live in harmony with nature. The argument is that this new technology will ultimately result in a new economy, one based on clean-energy and recycled resources, rather than heavily polluting fossil fuels.

Scientists, authors and other experts in the field - including Stephen Hawkings - are interviewed throughout the course of the film.

The movie ends on an upbeat, power-to-the-people note, showing how all individuals can make a difference by raising their awareness and making informed and thoughtful choices in what they do and buy - and by getting involved.

It's an inspiring message from an inspiring film.",1298764800,3,2550,5.235294117647059

Due to DiCaprio's role as narrator it should be a documentary received by a wide audience and is a must see. I think (or wish) it was a must see for all and not just environmentally oriented minds as they are already aware of the concerns expressed in this DVD - it is the ones not aware that we need to get onboard and this DVD will certainly be one such vehicle to gain access to a potentially new crowd.

Why would you have someone that is always flying around in planes and works for an industry that builds sets then tears them down and throws them in the trash be the main speaker instead of having a reputable scientist? The only reason that I can think is to attract a larger audience, but at a price of doing exactly what they say is bad for the enviroment. I would have rather seen Ed Begley in this movie at least he lives the lifestyle. The movie itself was ok but there are a lot better resources and movies out there than this one, but if you are interested on this topic then I would recommend it because any/as much information is always good.

1576009,4,B00005JPXA,"After reading two of the ""one star"" reviews, I can't help wondering if there's an Evil Twin of ""The 11th Hour"" out there making the rounds.  Otherwise, those two reviews make no sense.  Neither of them even comes close to expressing the essence of what I saw on the dvd I watched.  It's true that the film makes greater use of interviews than visuals - and that would be a defect if there were not already an abundance of images in the public domain showing melting glaciers, rising sea levels, deforestation and extreme weather.  It would also have been a defect if the people being interviewed had been incoherent or overly academic in their delivery - but they weren't.  Each one offered ideas and studied opinions on various aspects of the problems facing us from the perspective of their particular field.  The film is far more about offering solutions than simply re-stating the enormous problems facing us. The one thing, more than anything else, I got out of this film - the one thing I hadn't really gotten from any other source - is that we already have the technology we need to begin moving away from fossil fuels.  That technology is not still in the development stage; nor is it 20 or 30 years away - it's already here, and ready to be adapted to the scale needed to make it a practical reality.  What's missing is the political will to make the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.  And that's basically what the film was about: identifying the thing that's keeping humanity tied to the fossil fuel treadmill that's slowing making the planet uninhabitable for humans and most other species currently alive.  It's not rocket science; it's the two ancient bugaboos of political science: ""creature of habit"" and ""status quo.""  We don't want to be bothered just yet.  There was a quote in the film attributed to Winston Churchill which just about says it all: ""The Americans always do the right thing - after they've tried everything else first.""

In other words, it sets up the current picture, but then leads the audience to think abouth how we could change the way we look at things so that we might be able to change to more sustainable ways of life in the future.

1576200,5,B00005JPXA,"The film is not so much about climate change. It is not so much about CO2. It is not so much about any ecological theme in particular, polluting the atmosphere, poisoning the oceans and waterways, exhausting the soil. It is about the inner truth that is ours, what has been our truth from the very start and what it is supposed to become if we are to survive as a species on this planet. Our inner truth is that we have a  brain in connection with a body and its senses capturing the surrounding environment, which provides us with the possibility to think, to analyze, understand, synthesize and modelize what we can capture with and via our senses, the possibility to create tools and procedures that enable us to multiply our resources, and the possibility to communicate to other members of our species, present or future, through oral and written communication, live or recorded on various media, memory having been and still being on particularly efficient and economical medium. And I must admit I was nicely surprised by the maturity of the discourse. Instead of only culpabilizing us and making us feel guilty about what we do to the earth, it takes a different stand that insist on the absurdity of our present attitude that has developed to an extreme point over the last two centuries after the first industrial revolution. It does not preach going back to a pre-electricity age or to a pre-mechanical transportation age. It defends the fundamental principle of the human species in its long fight for survival and development: frugality, economy, saving, using resources with the principle that says as much as necessary but no more than needed. No waste at all, then no want eventually. And the best way not to waste is to use things and resources that are renewable, hence sustainable. Sustainability comes from the fact that we aim at economizing and never exhausting any source of whatever it is we want or need. At this level of reason and responsibility, the film turns marvelously poetic. The images, be they of catastrophes or of vital miracles, everyday natural life, are extremely beautiful and dealt without any fake editing, or so little. The beauty of the penguins walking to the ocean after their release on some beach is a moment of grace, and that shows what nature is all about: life and saving the natural resources we need to remain alive. The penguins go to the ocean the way we go to energy but they would never try to pollute or exhaust it. They will naturally live in equilibrium with their environment. And this we do not do right now. We have to change our way of thinking more than anything else. And that has to be done immediately, drastically and fast. That is only a question of political leadership, and not any maverick-ness or maverick-ity. We need calm, pondered upon and collective leadership that will give us the right, the duty, the responsibility to make the main choices and to manage and command the various procedures that will come out of these decisions. And once again the film turns poetic speaking of the mind, of the beauty of our spiritual capabilities. It valorizes in us our unique human creativity in order to make us reject our ubiquitous greed and desire to exploit to exhaustion if profit there is in it. We have to go back to the ecology of the mind our distant homo sapiens ancestors demonstrated when they started inventing tools to make hunting and fishing more efficient, and the domestication of animals and the cultivation of the earth to increase their collective resources in order to sustain the survival and development of the community with only one rule in their minds: economy, i.e. no more effort or work than necessary and no waste of what was gathered, hunted, fished or cultivated. The economy is part of the biosphere of this planet but the biosphere is not at the service of the economy. The economy must develop and can only do that by using the biosphere and its resources but in such a way that the biosphere is not exhausted, hence in a sustainable way. And that's the poetry of the message. You are not guilty of anything but humanity in general  has grown irresponsible, hence wasteful and un-sustainable. Like a poem never uses one word or even syllable too many, we have to learn how to use what we need, not more, and make sure what we have used has been renewed or is being renewed for the future generations.

1576202,3,B00005JPXA,"THE 11TH HOUR is a cautionary and doomsday documentary with a powerful line-up of intelligent men and women speaking to the destruction we as humans are doing to our planet Earth. Hosted by film star Leonardo DiCaprio (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M5AJQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>) and with a stunning array of cross-cultural people backing up claims surrounding the terrible price of the human footprint on the globe (from Stephen Hawking to Michel Gorbachev and David Suzuki), the stories of doom and gloom will most likely make your hair stand on end.

Before we get into the meat and potatoes of this documentary, let me say that I believe in human causes for global warming. And that we have polluted -- and continue to pollute -- this pale blue dot we call home. Governmental apathy and greed have played a huge role within this problem, but so has the greed of your average Joe with a 401k (ever look at where your money is invested? Which stocks? Is Chevron or Mobil or Shell in there?).

The 11th Hour lays out a great set of problems facing us as a planet, not as individual nations. But what it failed horribly on is showing us those that don't believe what is being said by the ecological community. Yes, they probably are backed by Big Oil. Yes, they probably aren't looking at the scientific data and only the emotions behind them. But I still would've liked to have seen SOMEONE (anyone) with a dissenting opinion so that the documentary had a better balance to it. I've complained about this before, and I don't think it is beneficial to those with a genuine concern for the planet to simply eliminate opposition. I say take them on! So what if they have more money than you. So what if they can bend the ear of every Senator and Congressman in Washington. Let's see their faces and let us know who they are. Those DVD watchers with even half an intellect will be able to sort through the details and understand what is being done and by whom. Don't fear the opposition. Use them to your advantage. Show how weak their arguments are and put them into the debate.

That being said, the study of Earth's problems (from globalization to the destruction of species and habitat) is a hoary one. The advancing issues aren't going to go away as we use more fossil fuels, pump out more babies (no population controls), and desire more ""things"" that we feel will make us somehow better than the Joneses ...until nothing of humanity remains.",1223769600,2,2526,4.856148491879351

""An Inconvenient Truth"" does a great job of presenting the science behind GW but is not well received by some due to the political image of the narrator.  ""The Great Warming"" a Canadian documentary film, is a very comprehensive and well scripted presentation on GW suitable for all audiences.  They have two versions tailored for churches, one for wildlife organizations and a general version.  ""The 11th Hour"" is a hard hitting video.

Yet Leo certainly did a great job, both with the production and with his narration. It took the concept a step beyond AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, which concentrated mainly on the facts. Leo brought in accomplished scientists and engineers to outline solutions - which most people, I'm sure, don't even know exist. These experts emphasized something that I don't think many people are aware of: We have the solutions. We have the technology to get back on track and begin to restore the Earth. There are methods that have already been tested and perfected, and if the Powers That Be were willing, we could get the ball rolling NOW. Yet it is that very power structure that is holding us back for the sake of lining its own pockets. In one sense, DiCaprio might be preaching to the choir - but on the other, his film is shouting loud enough to reach beyond the church walls. The film has all the impact of Michael Moore's SICKO. Congratulations, Leo. You've done your part.

Now: Who is going to take the next step? Who is going to stick his or her neck out and emphasize that if we don't start to heal the planet NOW, the rich and powerful won't have much time to enjoy their wealth and power. What good is having control over thousands of people when those thousands are too weak and sick to work? What good are fancy cars when there's no place to go anymore? Contrary to what some people think, we can't wait for that generation to retire or die off. Now that we know what the problem is and how to correct it, what next?

1576414,5,B00005JPXA,"The 11th Hour is the most thorough and balanced assessment I've seen yet of the effect of human activities on the planet Earth. The well-paced narrative is shared by many authoritative voices, all of whom have taken the courageous first step of daring to speak up.

The best thing about the film is that it leaves one with the sense that ""we can do this"".  We can stop the insanely escalating motion of Man's destruction of their own habitat--our own habitat.  This message is backed by very concrete practical actions to take.

I first learned of Global Warming in 6th grade -- that was 44 years ago.  It scared me then, and it has come to pass exactly as the scientists were predicting at that time ""...if people don't change what they are doing"".
Now, finally, I understand what I have to do and how to do it.  And I know there are millions of other earth-residents who are doing the same thing.

Why watch a movie about it?  Because the film inspires.  I needed inspiration.  As an addict of just about every kind of convenience, I needed positive motivation.

Think of it this way -- positive change starts with the first step.  Letting yourself get inspired (and helping to inspire others) is a pain-free first-step of self-discipline.  After that, the rest starts to feel more like an adventure.

Before I watched this film, I was without hope, but doggedly looking for a cause for hope.  After watching this film, I am energized and looking forward to participating in the great awakening of humanity.",1211760000,,1509,4.662878787878788

However, I never had the chance to view the movie I bought from you because it was returned without ever reaching my door step, the one I watched was rented from Blockbuster. I don't know who you use for shipping, DHL perhaps, but you should strongly consider another service as this one has proven to be quite unreliable. I double checked all of the info I had provided to you and everything was correct on my end. Another product ordered within minutes of this purchase through a different Amazon vendor arrived on time without any issues to the same address.

I guess I give Amazon the credit for auto-reimbursing me, but it happend the day I was supposed to receive the movie. It's still a bit confusing/frustrating why it is so difficult for a company to find my house, I live in the suburbs, not off on a dirt road with no street signs. Oh well.

In closing, it's a decent movie worth watching, but for me the previews made it out to be much more impactful than it actually was.

The 11th Hour makes Gore's film look like child's play; as if it were put together by a team of complete amateurs.  This groundbreaking docu-drama (I like to think so anyway) provides enough information & data (all of which is provided by the scientists themselves - Hawking, to name one) to potentially convert the most staunch opponents of global warming.

1576418,2,B00005JPXA,"Let me just give you some pros and cons, as that's what seems to work best in reviews for things like this:

Pro's:

1. Well written, well produced. This is a pretty slick presentation.
2. The running time is long enough to make a strong argument, but short enough to not put a casual viewer to sleep.
3. The soundtrack was gentle, austere and not too over-dramatic which would've obscured the telling of the narrative.
4. Leonardo DiCaprio, surprisingly, has a good voice for narration which isn't that bad to listen to, unlike other productions which can just turn a person away.
5. A lot of the diagrams, charts and animations are incredibly overwhelming and informative. This is a cleaner presentation than what was done in 'An Inconvenient Truth'.
6. The story presented flows well and is educational to anyone who hasn't yet heard any of this information.
7. $4.99 at Target was a fantastic price. Nice touch.

Con's:

1. The strong endorsement of Biofuels, which is now a dead issue makes this DVD Documentary outdated, antiquated and seemingly foolish to have released without editing out. This drastically cuts into the credibility of this Documentary and thus a lower Amazon star rating. Leo is more of a victim of early adoption than anything, which is forgivable, but not something to overlook.
2. Overpopulation is mentioned a few times in the documentary, just to make rebuttal to the other reviewers, but only briefly and in passing. Overpopulation is not something that was focused on, which probably should have been the opening segment. To be fair though, the subject of Overpopulation is not something that the media mentions a lot, so it's not a surprise that Leo would've also overlooked it, as he's more of follower with this production than a leader. And a populist rather than a modern thinker.
3. There are many shots of Leo standing around observing the scenery in different locations throughout the World, which is something Orson Welles was fond of doing in his footage, but it just comes across as 'Where's Waldo', instead of adding to the narrative.

There it is in a nutshell. Hopefully that helps. I was able to get through to the end, where I was greeted by Coldplay, but I doubt I'd watch it again. Maybe his next effort on this subject will be more carefully thought out, but equally crafted.",1210723200,63,2327,4.822055137844612

1576420,1,B00005JPXA,"It's tough for global warming believers (of which I am one).  On the one hand, we have to present scenarios that make the everyday person recognize the scope of environmental problems, but not make the potential outcome seem so bleak as to discourage action.  The 11th hour doesn't help much.

While I guess it's a good idea to have scientists speaking for themselves, it's not so useful when all you get from them are a sentence or two--devoid of context and essentially serving as a plug for their pet issue.  As usual, big business is presented as a ""villain""--the issue of why businesses full of smart people would choose to completely ignore seemingly unchallengeable science avoided.  The implication is that they are ""greedy"" ready to destroy the planet for that extra dollar.  Not so convincing to anyone that's worked in big business.

I've read things by most of the commenters that compose the film, and most of them have more depth to their ideas than is apparent here.  Maybe it would have been better to have 5 people talk about their ideas in depth rather than 100 speak for 30 seconds.  You essentially have to be a ""believer"" going in to the film or take them at their word.  Wouldn't convince any smart person I know of anything.",1210118400,12,1247,4.678899082568807

1576523,2,B00005JPXA,"There was no mention of the human race trying to control its spiraling population. Human overpopulation has now become the Problem more than anything else. They made a mention of there being twice as many people today as there were when Kennedy was president. Their hopes for the future of technology are just too hopeful. They put me vaguely in the mind of old science fiction novels that assumed by the year 2000 humans would have colonized Mars and all of us would me moving around via individual jet packs. Even if eventually possible, the technology they mention  can only raise our carrying capacity for a very short while. (For more information about this, google Albert Bartlett. He has some amazingly entertaining video lectures that are sure to please you.) Consider that when the deer population in American woodlands increases to a certain level, hunting is encouraged by the government to reduce the deer population. The argument against animal rights groups is thus: the deer that will survive hunting season will have more food and will therefore be healthier. Since the makers of this documentary consider us part of nature, they need to realize that the planet cannot sustain more human population growth.

We NEED negative human population growth NOW.

If the human population continues to grow, there will be dire consequences. In the words of the famous Isaac Asimov, ""Democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people into the world, the value of life not only declines, it disappears. It doesn't matter if someone dies. The more people there are, the less one individual matters.""

Moreover, I begin to question the whole intelligence of this documentary because of their (granted very brief) endorsement of biofuels. Everyone knows that biofuels are very bad for the environment, considering how much deforestation will have to be accomplished in order to grow corn and soybean to turn into fuel. Not to mention that biofuels are driving up food prices, causing more and more people to starve.

The comparisons to the 2006 Al Gore documentary on the subject,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Inconvenient-Truth/dp/B000ICL3KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, are expected and actually quite interesting.  Gore's film is The 11th Hour-Lite, but really it was a bit more compelling because of it.

The 11th Hour is still a decent film despite its flaws and it presents a great mix of concerned voices for change.  The list includes Stephen Hawking, Mikhail Gorbachev, David Orr, Paul Hawken, James Woolsey, David Suzuki, Kenny Ausubel, and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, among many others.  There are moments when different people express the same point based on essentially the same evidence and there are also moments of great truth and insight.  This is Leonardo DiCaprio's film and I know there are a lot of conservatives out there who I disagree with more often than not who wince when seeing DiCaprio here, but I couldn't help but catch a little bit of the fever that conservatives have when attacking Hollywood's elite with that sort of ""shut up and act!"" aggression.  He is just an actor after all, and even though it's nice that he has a cause, it just doesn't sit well that he is narrating a film poised as a voice of authority when so many great thinkers on this very subject get less face-time.  I say that not as a criticism that Leo is expressing his well-informed opinion, but that his presence seems a tad bit egotistical.

I'm conflicted though because what I liked about the 11th Hour is that it has teeth, so its propaganda label is a double edged sword for me.  I like the fact that it attacks the audience into action because it does so by presenting us not just facts but scientists and other authorities backing the facts up by saying essentially the same thing; we're doomed if we don't change.  Folks don't want to here that and even if things are not as dire as they're presented here, action is a necessity at this point.  The most important thing that can come out of this is that people will talk and maybe read about this important subject, even if their research is a way for them to try and challenge the validity of anthropogenic global warming.  Remember though, one of the film's most important points is that this is not a matter of faith, the overall subject is science and these assertions are based on observation, predictability, and above all evidence.  We must all remember to let the evidence rise above the hype and the politics, no matter how boring it is to learn about or how scary it will be to understand the truth.

Mixed recommendation overall from me here, but for five dollars you really can't go wrong.  Be sure to supplement your viewing with some informative literature on this material, so you are well-equipped to read between the lines.",1209340800,3,4055,5.487138263665595

1576527,5,B00005JPXA,"Mother's Day is getting close and for 40 plus years I've discouraged my kids from observing this lemming, corporate driven holiday.  I've always seen it as a device perpetrated by advertising and merchandising executives to feather their bottom line at the expense of children.  No matter that the ""children"" are in their 40's, they are still brainwashed into falling into lockstep at the local mall to purchase jewelry, flowers and candy for Mom on this contrived holiday.  This year will be different for me. I've purchased 8 copies of this DVD (in it's eco-friendly packaging) and will be sending it away to each of my offsprings and a few significant others, asking that they give me 92 minutes of their time and watch this documentary.

It's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" for the common man.  The lessons are easy to understand and the basic message is hard to deny.  Corporate America is responsible for many of the ills of the world today.  They give lip service to long range goals but the reality is that they can't see further than the next quarters bottom line.  I'm asking my children to not conjure perconceived notions of what this films material will be and to not make a judgement until the film is over.  I'm then not asking that they even buy into the doctrine - just accept that their mother does.  After all these years, I want to have my day.  bg",1209168000,,1361,4.652719665271967
1576528,4,B00005JPXA,I paid $4.95 for my copy so was extremely pleased.  The documentary provides the best all around analysis of the devastation caused by the disease that is the human race.  The only shortcomings are Leonardo Dicaprio's reading the tele-prompter as if he was actually concerned and the lack of solutions proposed.  Great movie for anyone who is interested in being educated about the global energy crisis and environmental problems associated with humans occupying the entire planet.,1208649600,,481,5.302631578947368
1576529,4,B00005JPXA,"I just finished watching the 11 Hour last night and my impressions were that the wide host of interviewees not only appropriate touched on all the necessary points but that they were amazingly articulate and interesting as well. The Documentary also has some fantastic but often horrific images. These really hit home what those being interviewed had to say.

After a while it got a little doom and gloom and I was wondering when they were going to get to the solutions providing a glimmer of hope. Not only did they do this but they gave more time to it than many documentaries on the subject which all to often only lightly touch upon the subject in the last few minutes. That is my biggest problem with the Inconvenient Truth. The 11th Hour also has a whole bonus section entirely devoted to solutions which I thought incredibly wise and will probably have a much greater effect because of it.

Though I am thankful Dicaprio produced this timely film unfortunately I think he was the weakest link in it. I felt either a different narrator or none at all would have been best. Overall still it is a must see in my book and I am thankful we have yet another wonderful environmental documentary out there.",1208649600,,1205,4.6
1576530,5,B00005JPXA,"This film is truly amazing.  It is like nothing I've ever seen about the environment or global climate change crisis.  For the first time in years, I actually felt hopeful instead of hopeless in the face of these issues.  Every time I watch a documentary, news show or science show and they talk of global warming, the environment, etc. it is just depressing.  To make the difference needed requires a fundamental change in humanity, who we are, and how we think.  But this film showed that although there is much to be done, there are people well on the way already.  You should give a copy of this to anyone you think will watch it.  We ordered 10 copies since it's on $5.",1208304000,,674,4.430894308943089
1576631,3,B00005JPXA,This documentary is just okay. It is more informative and educational than An Inconvient Truth and doesn't exaggerate as much. I believe it betrays global warming more factually and shows more critical thinking. It does suggest that the earth will be okay but humanity may suffer real setbacks. The documentary had less sizzle though and Leonardo DiCaprio disappoints me. He had less persona than the scientists. I thought this documentary would just copy Al Gore's documentary but it doesn't. This documentary would have been better airing on Discovery than theaters.,1208131200,,568,5.322222222222222
1576632,2,B00005JPXA,"I was deeply disappointed after watching 11th hour. Having read positive reviews and a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio I was looking forward to a good documentary on global warming. Unfortunately this documentary failed miserably and is rather forgettable.

The first of several problems that made this fail is the exectuion. Almost the entire film is nothing but interviews blended together and every so often intercut with scenic scenes. Yes this is a documentary but some of the interviews with scientist which were very vague or just plain confusing to the common watcher.

The narration by Leonardo DiCaprio failed horrible due to once again very vague and hard to understand terms that made you zone out as he was talking. After listening to the interviews and then hearing the narration made you just want to shout ""TELL ME IN PLAIN ENGLISH!"".

Another thing was there was nothing really new, after Al Gore's very informative documentary there was nothing new on Global Warming and the ideas for the future change is good but they are such big changes that need to take place you feel hopeless. Especially as even the interviewees admit many of the probelms are due to leadership/law issues with congress and the white house.

Overall a HUGE disappointment, I give Leo credit for trying but unfortunately is was so poorly put together and almost feels purposely made uninteresting and dull.",1207872000,,1395,5.0
1576633,3,B00005JPXA,"This movie was billed so highly that I expected it to be riveting.

They don't let the ""experts"" share the exciting things they are up to and give a very stilted view of who these (mostly) men are.  Considering this was basically a bioneers conference syllabus except with better visuals I think they left out some of the most exciting things afoot right now.",1206489600,,499,4.6477272727272725

1576635,5,B00005JPXA,"This film is leagues beyond the Al Gore film and does not have any politics riding it like a  donkey either.

Is the planet warming? Yes. Is man the cause? Not 100% sure. Should we be way more responsible with the environment regardless? You better believe it!

This film is not just some scare tactic movie with charts and graphs guilting you into buying a hybrid car. This film brilliantly proposes a fundamental shift in humanities overall attitude and approach towards just about everything.

I could not help think of Star Trek and feel hopeful for our future provided we stop fighting, come together as one people and see ourselves as a single race of humans on  a single planet rather than a bunch of disparate peoples arguing over semantics while inefficiency is the norm.

The future is now people. We can all change our ways almost effortlessly while saving ourselves money as well. Simple changes will collectively have a huge impact on the world and will send a powerful message to the business world that we want change for the better now.

I personally have a very small car and have switched my home to energy efficient light bulbs. I also now use my own bags in stores when I shop. This has saved me money with little expense up front.

No need to debate global warming. Making changes for the better is simply the right thing to do, and  as stewards of this planet there is no time like the present.",1197417600,49,1416,4.565217391304348

1576637,5,B00005JPXA,"Thank you Leonardo diCaprio and all those involved in making this film and bringing it to the people's attention. I live in Alaska, the effects of our warming planet is before my eyes every day. The sink-holes here (created by melting perma frost) are getting bigger, big enough to swallow trees and small sheds. I pass two glaciers on my way to Anchorage every month; For the past 15 years the glaciers that use to be very close to the road have receded back about  mile. There is black mineral where glacial ice once stood; and for the past 10 years our politicians in Juneau have been telling people in Washington  ""there is no scientific evidence of global warming"" (our Juneau politicians are in bed with the oil barrons) I ask you, does one need ""scientific evidence"" when the effects grow before our eyes daily? My fear has been that people outside (lower 48) would believe the politicians from Alaska. One of our city mayors is smarter than our politicians in Juneau; he invited some people from ""outside"" to come and see for themselves, the bare ground that has never been seen before. There are many more signs of too much warming. My Great Grandmother used to say ""when there is no more land for them to take, they will take it away from their children."" This film tells the truth about how the land is being stolen from the children. I was paying so much attention to the  message that I did not notice the technical aspects of dialogue, staging, lighting, or any of that other stuff.",1196899200,10,1496,4.574626865671642
1576638,4,B00005JPXA,"Do we have ""all the time in the world""? We never do. The clock is ticking, and so live well. In this profound assemblage of sweeping themes and smart people, we are reminded how lovely, how lovable, how tragic and how complicated life is now on Planet Earth. ""The 11th Hour"" transcends the genre of environmental movie; it takes on LIFE as we know it. It is a collage, spliced together to great effect with a fantastic soundtrack, an homage to the globe as we know it today, in 2007. It may be the best human document of the year -- and even of the decade (we'll see). ""The 11th Hour"" brings together threads that in so many other works remain disparate. Here, the collective tapestry is compelling, tying together plants, animals, biodiversity, food, population, immigration, migrations of all sorts, global climate change, pollution, politics, religious strife, war, conflict, the human will and the human spirit and what it will take to counter these challenges, to reverse the tide of dangers we face.

The selection of talking heads is stellar, and there are 55 interviewees cited in the credits, ranging from Stephen Hawking to Paul Hawken to Jerry Mander to Paul Anderson to Hermann Daly to one of my ultimate environmental heroes, David Suzuki, who, in my mind, provided several of the most evocative moments in the film.

Perhaps the talking heads are not household names, but this is not a film of, by and for nerds. It may be of and by nerds, but it really is for anyone who loves the planet and is looking to connect with the best minds and the best innovations in which we may realistically base some hope for improving things soon and in the near future.

Not all is gloom and doom in ""The 11th Hour."" The last third of the film is filled with a vast array of innovations that we can get going with now. They come by at a fast clip, so much so that after seeing the film once just a few days ago, I was almost immediately ready to watch it again. And perhaps that is the best compliment for any film, and especially a documentary. Could you watch it again? Would you want to? I think thousands of viewers will give a resounding ""YES"" to both questions.

Surely, the added bonus features to be included on the DVD will add even more to the richness of the experience -- and the power of the messages, the insights and the WISDOM of ""The 11th Hour.""

Thanks to Leonardo diCaprio for producing the film, but alas, it is because of diCaprio that it loses one star. His periodic narration is journeyman quality at best, not stellar, and strangely, his segments are shot in nice outdoor locations but poorly lit with subpar sound quality. Perhaps a more compelling narrator would have strengthened the film even more. But that is a small quibble in the big scheme of things, and this is an important work about the biggest of all things, so don't let any quibble stop you from getting a copy of this film to share with family and friends who care enough to pay attention and perhaps even, when it comes to our greatest challenges, to act for the greater good of all people and life on Earth.",1188950400,22,3099,4.526785714285714

Of course, comparisons will be made to An Inconvenient Truth, so I'll cover that too: it's clear that this project was always intended to be a film; it didn't begin as a PowerPoint presentation.

While I found it tempting to think ""what difference can I make alone?"" I came to understand is how can I contribute toward the whole. What I as an individual can do may not be significant, but when many people become aware and take action the combined actions can become significant.
