2472422,5,B000CS45II,"I have been doing Leslie Sansane's workouts for years.  I like her simple approach to fitness (no confusing dance steps).  It's refreshing to see the workouts with models of all shapes, sizes, and ages and Leslie's enthusiasm is very motivating. The Walk Strong dvd at 33 min. is my favorite because it has a great mix of weight training and walk aerobics and utilizes using more than one muscle group at a time.  Even though it seems quick, I definitely feel like I've had a great workout that keeps me going all day.  It skimps on the stretching at the end, so plan on adding 5 min.to your workout time to do your own.",1151625600,7,620,4.412280701754386
2472423,5,B000CS45II,"I have been walking with Leslie Sansone for two years, and I have 20 of her workouts. This one is definitely in my top five, and I keep it in rotation several days per week. I have no trouble getting my heartrate into my target zone, and I'm no beginner! I love the intervals, and I enjoy the multi-muscle toning combining upper and lower body. The music is zippy and motivating. I get a good sweat and have a lot of fun. Walk Strong is unquestionably one of Leslie Sansone's best workouts ever.",1151539200,12,495,4.333333333333333
2472424,5,B000CS45II,"This is most definitely one of the most enjoyable workouts I've had in a long time. In just 30 minutes, I did more squats and lunges than I would ever have done on my own. I like her attitude. I didn't find her voice annoying while I did the workout and the music (wasn't listening for the words, just the pace of it) was pretty good too. She definitely broke a sweat out on this newbie.

The only thing I didn't like was that she didn't emphasize enough about the dangers of overextending your knee and since I have knee problems that is most definitely something I need to be considerate of.",1151366400,,593,4.294642857142857
2472425,4,B000CS45II,"I used to keep in shape by doing the old Firm workouts.  I slacked off for a VERY LONG time and recently bought all those old tapes again only to discover, to my chagrin, that I was far too out of shape to follow the Firm tapes.  I needed gentle cardiovascular conditioning and gradually build back up to the Firm tapes (duh!)...and I was lucky enough to discover Leslie.  I have a couple of her One Mile workouts and I was looking for something a little more challenging.  Walk Strong fits the bill.  This is a wonderful workout and a great change from her other walking programs.  It really is Firm ""Lite"".  Though she's a little short on instruction, she demonstrates perfect form so keep your eye on her.  And you have to love an exercise video in which the participants actually sweat!!  How motivating! I also like that there is ZERO banter to her fellow exercisers (she still talks a lot, though!).  That said, this is a wonderful addition to any workout library and it can grow with you because you can just increase the weights as you go. One thing though, lifelong couch potatoes may not make it all the way through the first few times...I couldn't! A wonderful buy!!

Update:  I've owned this DVD for a few weeks now and I love it!  If I could change my rating to 5 stars, I would!  It really is one of Leslie's best!",1150502400,19,1328,4.389344262295082
2472426,5,B000CS45II,"I have many of Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds workouts and in my opinion this one is by far the best. The pace is fast enough to get your heart rate up. Even during the intervals of using the weights my heart rate stayed up. Leslie's workouts were instrumental in my 30 pound weight loss last year but after a while I felt like I needed something more. I definitely felt the burn after doing this one. It's challenging but it won't kill you like some other workouts. The lunges and squats did a good job of working my thighs, which is a trouble area for me. And if you need more of a challenge you just add heavier weights or go deeper into the squats and lunges.

I have no doubt that if I keep doing the Walk Strong video it will boost my metabolism enough to help me finish shedding my extra pounds. If you are new to WAP or have been doing them for years, I believe you will enjoy this one and I highly recommend it.",1149379200,10,919,4.105555555555555
2472427,5,B000CS45II,"You need 3lb. or 5 lb. weights for this amazing interval workout. Leslie alternates between fast walking (with no weights) and strength training (with weights). She does this for the equivalent of two miles. Her strength training segments are super-efficient as she always coordinates upper body work with lower body work (you'll do more than 100 squats during the workout!). This is the most effective and enjoyable ""Leslie workout"" yet. I'm finally seeing results. I absolutely recommend this DVD!!!",1146528000,27,501,5.3544303797468356
2472428,5,B000CS45II,"I have about 7 other Walk Away the Pounds tapes/DVD's and this BY FAR gives me the best all around workout of them all. It's an interval workout with weight training and walking inter-mixed. The walking is very brisk, and the toning is really challenging. I used 5 pounds weights like Leslie, and I felt the burn. She doesn't tone one body part at a time, ie: arms, then legs. She tones arms and legs at the same time, which makes you work SO much harder. For example, you do lunges while doing tricept kickbacks and then squats while doing bicept curls. This tape is a fantastic 30 minute routine with cardio and weight training packed in together. She doesn't waste one minute. Awesome, awesome, awesome!",1145577600,39,706,4.611111111111111
2472429,5,B000CS45II,"This workout is the one of the best workouts for your rear end, your legs and your upper body that I have ever done.  All the while it is low impact.  Great for folks with a back injury (like me). This workout is equal to two miles of walking.  A word of advice, you might want to do it one time without any weights to get the hang of the lunges and the hand movements.  The intervals make the time fly by.  I love this workout and will make sure it stays in the rotation with the other walking workouts I have.",1145318400,50,511,3.9705882352941178
2472430,5,B000CS45II,"Although there's nothing in the marketing of this workout that would tell you this, this workout is filmed in the same studio and with the same walkers as the Walk & Kick and Walk & Jog workouts, both of which are also excellent. This is a 30-minute workout (equivalent to 2 miles, Leslie says) in which you do Leslie's usual walking steps interspersed with several 3-minute intervals of strength training using handweights. The 5 walkers, including Leslie, use no weights, 1-lb. weights, 2-lb. weights, 3-lb. weights, or 5-lb. weights. She demonstrates good form as you do lunges and various lifts to work different parts of the upper and lower body. I wish she gave a little more instruction on the safety of doing lunges so that beginners won't injure their knees, but overall it's an excellent workout. It's easy to follow, gives you a good overall workout,  and is a great introduction to strength training if you've been wanting to try it on your own.",1144108800,96,957,4.8
2472431,5,B000CS45II,"I have lots of Leslie's walking dvds and this one really gives me a workout - I think it's because it has the lower/upper body work intervals along with the fast walking. You walk briskly, do a few minutes of lunges/lifts, etc. in between and then resume walking briskly again.  My heart rates goes even faster while I am doing the toning segments, so I wouldn't worry about not keeping your heart rate going at all. I can finish the walk but it really gets my heart pumping thanks to the lunges and squats.  I feel like I am more sweaty and tired after this walk than any of the others - even the longer ones.  I like this dvd a lot.",1143417600,33,634,4.180327868852459

2472444,5,B000CS45II,"This is my favorite Leslie Sansone dvd. I have about 10 others and rotate them regularly. When I read the other reviews about the included weight training I was intrigued. I lost 100 pounds 5 years ago going to Curves which alternated cardio with strength training. I have gained some of the weight back because my Curves closed 3 years ago:(

This is closest thing I have found to replicating the Curves workout. The first time I did it, I used no weights but I did all the squats and lunges. Needless to say I was so sore the next few days it was hard to sit down and even walk. I have done this workout about 4 times since with no soreness. I get the most unbelievable and fast workout in 30 minutes! I sweat like a pig, more than I do with her 3 and 4 mile walks. I highly recommend this workout. Just be careful on the lunges and squats. If something hurts stop doing it!",1458691200,8,876,4.183431952662722
2472445,4,B000CS45II,"This is a nice DVD for interval training.  After the warm up, Leslie alternates her brisk walk routine with weight training.  Beware haters of squats and lunges, you will be squatting and lunging while using weights to tone your upper body!  Personally, I like that the full body workout continues with the weights.  Leslie is motivating, as usual.  I appreciate that she really explains and teaches the moves, so important with weights.  This is an older DVD.  The backdrop is more Italian Villa circa the 1990's.  It is amusing but not distracting.  A trivial complaint that does not mar a good workout.",1456099200,5,605,4.852941176470588

I like the music, and I like the fact that Leslie is not as chatty as a few other videos. She concentrates on the workout and gives valuable tips on doing them correctly. I like the music too. This is one of the more challenging videos I purchased on Leslie Sansone. I'm 61 years old, and I work out with a friend who is in her early seventies.",1442620800,,450,4.125
2472448,5,B000CS45II,"Only one workout with this DVD, but it packs a big punch. It's a 30 minute workout with a few minutes of stretches at the end. The workout includes a warm up walk, then intervals of brisk walking alternated with intervals of muscle toning. Small hand held weights can be used during the toning intervals, or for the entire workout, or use no weights at all, whatever works best for the walker.",1441497600,,393,4.472222222222222

2472470,5,B000CS45II,I just discovered Leslie Sansone last summer and have a variety of her DVD's. I have lost 50 pounds and wanted something to help me with toning. This DVD really gives you a great workout. I love the three minute intervals between walking and toning. This workout equals a 2 mile walk and goes by really fast.,1397692800,,308,4.421052631578948

2472483,2,B000CS45II,Well-  it has a good idea to it - but breaking up the walking doesn't keep my heart rate up and the leg/arm work really wasn't enough to feel effective.,1382745600,,152,4.066666666666666
2472484,5,B000CS45II,"I used this tape to get in shape for my wedding, along with dieting.  It is a great workout.  Very repetitive in the steps so easy to follow but can get boring after a while.  I would recommend using this tape in addition to other workouts to keep things fun.",1377043200,,259,4.14
2472485,3,B000CS45II,"I like it because it helps me stay strong and healthy.  It is well worth using to stay in shape.  My main criticism is that it is not as lively, with input from the other people in the DVD, such as in Get Up and Get Started.  I alternate use of both DVD's several times a week.  I am very appreciative, however, that Leslie Sansone has created these DVD's and I have used them for many years.  I am now 73 years old and in pretty good health, including being at a normal weight for my height.",1372636800,2,492,4.030927835051546

2472488,5,B000CS45II,"One exercise routine - a combination of brisk walking and strength training exercises. This routine requires a stretchy band, which I already had from another DVD. It did not come with its own. The routine takes about 37 minutes.",1365984000,,229,4.897435897435898
2472489,4,B000CS45II,"I've been on a journey to lose 50 lbs since the end of last year (I'm halfway there now!). My buddy who's a trainer suggested I start weight training as that burns a lot more calories than cardio alone. However looking at the machines at the gym, and not having a clue where to start/what to work on, I was a bit intimidated.

I found this DVD at a used store and after having been on Leslie's walking workouts for a month or so decided to try it out. The first time I did them, I didn't feel like I was doing much until I woke up the next morning, my arms and thighs were sore!

The workout itself is mainly arms, upper legs and not much core work. If you can't do squats or lunges yet, I wouldn't recommend it as there's no real modification for them. Overall, it's still pretty low impact but you'll work up a nice sweat.

Leslie's usual perkiness is definitely prominent through the video, and the video quality is reminiscent of the 90s videos with some weird decor. But since I'm there to workout, that's a bit irrelevant but I'm sure it's something noticeable while watching.",1363996800,,1082,4.346534653465347

2472502,5,B000CS45II,"I bought this after seeing a clip on youtube.  And I love it.  My heart rate hits 80% during the first weight interval, and stays there until the cool down.  I have been alternating this video with the 4 really big miles every other day 7 days a week and this has created a winning combo for me.  My arms and shoulders were the first to transform.  One thing though, since I wasn't real familiar with squats, learn how to do them properly to prevent pain in your knees.  There are lots of videos on youtube that demonstrate proper form.",1350691200,,536,4.31

I am a little more advanced as far as workouts go, usually 40-45 minutes and strength training on alternate days, but this workout is awesome. Combines both, is easy but advanced enough to get you sweating, which is what you want. I live in an area where you don't workout outside in the Summer, it's just too  hot, so I use this dvd (it's my second copy!) three times a week coupled with treadmill and lap swimming on alternate days.

The only problem I feel I must warn other Boomers about is the strain it may put on your knees.  The weight training intervals are made up entirely of squats and lunges.  Normally, I only have occasional minor knee pain, but I can only make it half way through the strength segments of the workout before I'm afraid it will do some damage, and have to finish it walking in place while I do the weights. I'm going to stick with it, and try to ""work through it"", as they say, but I don't recommend it to anyone who already has knee issues. Squats and lunges are not your friends!

I don't like ""dance-y"" or complicated routines, such as step or Jazzercise. This is much more my style: easy directions with a heads-up by Leslie when she's going to change a move. You can make this a tougher workout as time goes on by increasing the amount of weight you use. The half-hour goes fast, which is great. I felt good after I did it and can't wait to do it again!

This is for viewers who don't like complicated routines, but want a thorough workout that can be done in a small area. It's also very low impact - no jumping or bouncing. Great for seniors or others who want gentler strength-building exercise.",1257120000,3,775,4.344827586206897

2472527,5,B000CS45II,"I bought this DVD in a package of 3: ""Walk Strong"", ""Muscle Mile One"", and ""30 Minute Walk"" for about 20$.  As an uncoordinated individual, I have enjoyed Leslie's DVDs very much.  I live in cold North Dakota, so her DVDs are wonderful for times when I can't get outdoors.

I have been weight training as well for the past 2 years and I swear by how wonderful strength training can make me feel all day long, so I wanted to know how Leslie would combine strength training with aerobics.  This was a simple, basic video that even I could figure out with my two left feet!  I'm mildly annoyed that she is selling ""Walk Away Weights"" when any sort of weighed object will do, but she doesn't turn her video into an infomercial and her walkers use a variety of hand weights.  (As a poor university student, I used two full water bottles, and I can see myself filling them with something heavier as I get more accustomed to this workout.)  Also, unlike some of her other videos, I found her to be much less chitty-chatty -- I think she'd be great as an in-person instructor, but since I use the DVDs over and over again, I don't want to memorize her pep talks.  Just cut to the chase, tell me what I need to exercise safely and effectively, and let the music entertain me, please!  ;)

She says the workout is the equivalent of 2 miles -- this might be so in terms of how much energy is used, but my pedometer only shows about a thousand steps.  No big deal -- muscles help me all day long!  I am glad this DVD is in my collection.  :)

For some reason, Amazon won't let me give this video 4 stars, and it's better than 3 stars, so I've given it 5 stars.  Really, I think it's a 4.5.",1232236800,2,1677,4.196875

I like to walk for a workout, but I wasn't sure I'd ever enjoy interval training. Yet, after doing this workout the first time, I felt great. The moderate pace was just right, yet challenging enough to bring good results.  So, after renewing my library copy at least once, I decided to purchase my own DVD.  Thanks, Leslie Sansone!",1220572800,,433,4.917808219178082
2472532,5,B000CS45II,"I've had this DVD for about a few months now, and I really enjoy it!  The fact that it's interval training (combining cardio and strength training in intervals) makes it a winner to me!  I began with 3 pound weights (hand-held dumbbells) that I purchased at a local Wal-Mart.  They were too light (I didn't feel a burn) so I bumped it up to 5 pound weights.  They have definitely played a key role in the results I've obtained!  I've noticed a difference in my arms, core, and legs.  Now I'm thinking to move up to 8 lbs soon as the 5 lbs are starting to feel a bit light, and I'm not working up as much of a sweat as I used to when I first started working out to this DVD.

The workout is only around 30 minutes long, and the time literally flies by!  For those whom the lunges/squats remain a challenge, I suggest following Ms. Sansone's advice which is to not go too deep.  Keep the movements shallow until you are able to work your way up to a greater level of resistance by going deeper.  I believe the key is consistency, to keep going and not to give up!  You will never challenge your body that way.  I've lost a considerable amount of weight working out to WATP DVDs, and I continue to lose and tone/shape my body!  I personally wouldn't attempt weight loss any other way!",1215561600,4,1281,4.243801652892562

I do this DVD every day along sometimes with a two or three mile walk and it has completely transformed the way I feel.  I have increased the weights I use and I always come away from it feeling energised and great.

This is a favorite and must have.
I currently use 4 lb weights and a heart monitor, this work out gets me and keeps me at my target heart rate and I am a big girl.
I have at least 30 of Leslie's workouts but I only have a few that are my favorites.
This one, the 3 mile powerwalk, the 3 mile weightloss walk(w/MaryKay leading the second mile) the 4 mile challenge, the 1 mile super challenge for the abs, walk stress, and 2 mile watp for abs.

Its not too fast paced but your heart rate will get up there. And the strength exercises are all the basics, and anyone can do them. I get in the lunges, squats, and tricep work, and it doesn't feel like over exersion. Plus, after getting to know the video, I can play music and put the video on mute, and still follow along.

This video involves the use of hand weights in intervals, so I get some strength training at the same time as my aerobic workout.  I also like that Leslie's workouts are easy to follow and don't involve a lot of complicated moves.  This workout is easy to understand and follow and can be adjusted to different intensity levels (by using larger/smaller movements and by using larger/smaller weights) to meet my own individual exercise needs.",1193702400,3,633,4.684684684684685

Then before you are to walk again the you will need to stop to put the weights down.  Seems like there may be a  better way to do it, and I found it in her 3 mile walk with weights.  Much better but much more rigorous.  Anyway the Walk Strong DVD is still good for a nice workout.",1193443200,3,442,3.760869565217391

This is a great one; I love the interval training with weights.  I never fail to break a sweat with this DVD and I feel as though I've accomplished something BIG before 7:00 a.m., which sets me up for the day in a positive way.  Leslie is so bubbly and encouraging that it makes the time fly by.

I alternate this DVD with her 5-Mile Walk and the old One Mile/Two Mile Walk DVDs, as well as the Lotte Berk Method ""Muscle Eats Fat"" and The Bar Method ""Body Sculpt"" DVDs.  With this combo of aerobics and stretching, in less than two months I have lost two dress sizes and my legs, bottom and arms are lookin' good...the abs are coming along nicely as well (I'm very lazy about ab work).  People compliment me all the time on my newly-toned figure and I love showing it off!  Size 8 feels great and I'm headed towards a 6, all thanks to Leslie!

Ususally you use weights and are going faster. I kept my heart rate at 80-90% of maximum. I keep a chart on the wall and check during the workout.

I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser (steady exercise routine for over 10 years), and I find that this video gives me a great workout. I love the fact that Leslie uses intervals since interval training helps burn fat faster and keeps the metabolism boosted throughout the day.

I wear a heart rate monitor, and I'm amazed at how high this workout raises my heart rate. I am 20 years old and weigh about 150 pounds and burn approximately 420 calories with this workout (per my HRM).

I would highly recommend this product for all exercise levels, as it is easy to modify and grow as you build endurance.

This is a great cardio and toning workout, particularly for the legs/thighs. The video rotates for 30 mins w/ 3 minute segments of cardio and strength training. There are a TON of squats (with different variations) in each strength segment that will have you shaking and sore by the next day, but this feels GREAT!

I am heavier and it bothered me that all of the leg work was lunges (not sure what the alternatives were, but wasn't happy).  I ended up doing mostly just the arms and then the walking work out.

There are some lunges, so be careful of your knees.  I modify the lunges to suit myself. Leslie always allows us to modify and customize to our own individual needs, and that's why I like her workouts so much.

8101605,5,B000CS45II,Nice easy work out.  But I should have looked closer for many different sets.  This only had one set.  But it is good for my first time CD.  Just right!  I'm happy with it!,1518739200,,172,3.9411764705882355
8101606,1,B000CS45II,Waste of money. The DVD skips through the whole exercise. Its not the DVD player because library DVDs which you would expect to skip from multiple use don't skip.,1516406400,,162,4.620689655172414

8101610,5,B000CS45II,"LOVE THIS!  It's short, effective, and fun, and therefore one of my favorite workout DVDs, and I own quite a few.  The pace is fast so your heart rate stays up for a good aerobic workout as well as toning.  You get a lot done in a short amount of time.  I make a few modifications like varying the weights according to the exercise being done, substituting static lunges for the side lunges because it's easier and less awkward for me, and at the end during her cooldown, I add some bent over rows, bridges, bicycles, and pushups (there's plenty of time and you've already starting to cool down because her last segment was toning rather than cardio, so you don't need to do hers), then add my own quick stretch.  Works great for me!  I think you burn more calories on this one compared to some of her newer ones.",1478563200,,813,4.3509933774834435
