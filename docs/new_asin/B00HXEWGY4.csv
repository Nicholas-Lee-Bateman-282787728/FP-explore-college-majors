6242507,5,B00HXEWGY4,"Great having this collection on bluray.  Funimation is always quality.  This anime is not widescreen ratio, but still good to have on blu for those of us transitioning our collections from Dvd.",1402963200,,193,5.0
6242508,4,B00HXEWGY4,My only complaint is that the cardboard sleeve was slightly damaged. The dvd's all worked fine and this is a great anime series.,1402531200,,128,4.608695652173913
6242509,5,B00HXEWGY4,"My review here will echo many of the thoughts that I put in my review for Part One of this release.

The video quality is as good as you can expect from a series that originally aired in 2005-2006. This set has the series in its original 4x3 screen ratio so don't expect this release to be in widescreen. For this reason, it's only in 1080i instead of the ever more prevalent 1080p. The audio is only 2.0 as well for both Japanese and English.

Unlike Part One, you will not find an additional bonus disc in the box. Instead, most of the bonus features have been put on the last disc, including a textless version of the final episode. In either case, the ending version you'll find in this release includes all the animation fixes that were missing in the original Japanese broadcast ending. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, then you can ignore can ignore this.

Just like I said for Part One, if you've been on the fence about purchasing this series, this release is probably as good as it's going to get, and I would certainly recommend it.",1399161600,7,1057,4.410256410256411
6242510,5,B00HXEWGY4,"You can read my review of Eureka 7 part one Limited Edition if you would like. This will be pretty much more of the same.

If it were possible for me to rate this higher than Eureka 7 part one, I would. It's just that good. The expanded character progression is very nice, many of the mysteries are explained, and events are wrapped up quite nicely.

The ending will make you sad that it's over.",1397433600,5,395,4.253333333333333
6242511,5,B00HXEWGY4,I am so glad that funimation brought this series back from the abyss. I couldn't really afford to spend high prices people where asking for to get the old bandai copies. And now they are on Bluray my preferred format. Now if funimation could get there streaming services right.,1392768000,4,277,4.673469387755102

6242530,4,B00HXEWGY4,"I had the original 12 disc set ,which took over 3 years,to come out.

6242540,5,B00HXEWGY4,"Lower in price than the actual DvD. obviously because dvd is collectable i guess? *rolls eyes* better quality. It's not in full screen for the 1080p  experience, but that's because it was made in 2006 and wasn't designed with HD tv's in mind.

The box art matched up along side Eureka Seven AO as well as the movie. I do not want to go into details about the anime because other posts have done so. I had no problems with the product and was very happy with its quality! If you are a fan of anime and are looking for a fun, affordable classic, this is for you!

6242557,5,B00HXEWGY4,if you already know the show theres not much to say but if your looking to start it then the blu ray disc is the way to go. but there was one thing that made this just a bad item and that was the fact it was not wide screen (16:9) it cones just in 4; something can be bothered to look.,1414368000,,285,3.6129032258064515

6242559,3,B00HXEWGY4,"I watched Eureka Seven Part One first and realised that I really needed to watch Eureka Seven Part Two as well if I was going to have any hope of understanding the series. You can find my review of E7 Part One on Amazon and this review will concentrate on Part Two almost exclusively.

This is a 26 part series which follows on from a previous series. In fact Parts 1 and 2 are really just one very, very, very long series. In part two we are able to understand what the overall peril presented to the characters actually is. The world is coming to an end and this is being hastened by Lt. Col Dewey Novak. The Gekko state must stop Dewey's plan and save the world. This series doesn't hang about. There are a lot of things to resolve and the story moves along well. I was pleased to see that the character development of Talho, Renton and Holland continued. It was also good to see that the relationship between Dominic and Anemone was also explained and expanded.

So why does this only get three stars?  Because i didn't really enjoy it. The action was good and the plot held some tension and most of the outstanding questions from part one were resolved. But two fundamental problems remain, the first is that in its current form I don't think you'd get too much from this if you hadn't seen part one. And, part one is way too long and slow. Secondly the actual ending is weak as is the whole explanation of the scub coral and the information limit. To have characters waltz off like Oberon and Titania from a midsummer night's dream at the end of 50 episodes was a let down. Even Cashern sins did better with the epilogue. Eureka Seven Part 2 had a couple of episodes of surprising emotional beauty especially ""World's End Garden"" but it isn't enough. Even though part two is more exciting and coherent it can't separate itself from part one. I'm glad I watched it all the way through but I find I don't want to watch it again. Hence 3 stars. I do thoink a lot of people would get something from this but buy it second hand if at all possible as it may disappoint too.

One more thing. This still probably isn't the best love story ever animated but the best love story in this isn't between Eureka and Renton or even Charles and Ray but it's the story of Talho and Holland.",1411257600,,2279,4.342723004694836
6242560,5,B00HXEWGY4,"Eureka Seven is the greatest animated love story ever. If you enjoy a love story, you will probably love this series.",1410134400,,117,4.619047619047619
6242561,5,B00HXEWGY4,Sweet story,1409184000,,11,5.0

6242567,5,B00HXEWGY4,"Combining surf culture with giant robots is a hard task, with one usually featuring people driven only to find the next great wave and the other to (usually) save mankind from extinction, be it from an external force or internal. Eureka Seven has done a fantastic job merging the two while keeping the magic of both cultures. Johnny Yong Bosch does an amazing performance as usual and the other characters provide a quality cast for him to play off of emotionally. While I don't consider this to be ""the greatest romance ever animated"" it was a fantastic show to watch and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of animation, giant robots, or surfing!",1406937600,,650,4.612068965517241

The series was a little weird. I would just rather watch Gundam Wing or Neon Genesis Evangelion (If I wanted real self-punishment). Too bubbly and hippy for me. My wife loved it though.
