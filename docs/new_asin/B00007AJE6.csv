1804878,4,B00007AJE6,"""It's Gaillardia! La Guardia is an airport in New York.""  This satire about the Cold War and British de-colonialization is a neglected classic.  Keep in mind that films are coded for particular audiences, and British films are more colloquial than their American counterparts and given their rather modest budgets tend to lack international appeal.  For a good example of what I am talking about, compare ""when Eight Bells Toll"" or ""Puppet on a Chain"" with ""Ice Station Zebra"" or ""Where Eagles Dare"" to see what the British could do with Alistair Maclean compared to Hollywood.  Obviously the Hollywood product is much better, and it should be given the difference in production values.  To properly appreciate this Carlton-Browne of the F.O., put yourself in the perspective of a Brit in the 1950s.  This was the period of near national bankruptcy, labor strife, and institutions that didn't work (even though they very carefully maintained the appearance that something useful was actually being done). The character Carlton-Browne (played by TT), who is an incompetent Foreign Office official, becomes immediately endearing.  Peter Sellers does not manage to steal the show as the chief advisor to the young king of Gaillardia, which is good.  I bought this movie as part of the Peter Sellers Collection but it is Terry-Thomas who brings out everything that is so frustrating yet loveable about British society of the 1950s.  That fact that this nation could laugh at itself goes a long way to proving that there was a lot of good nature buried underneath the disfunctional institutions.  I am not going to say any more about the story - you will have to watch that yourself.  The transfer on my DVD is perfect and appears to have been restored.  Unfortunately there are no subtitles, otherwise I would have rated this Anchor Bay release *****.",1371945600,8,1847,5.019672131147541
1804879,5,B00007AJE6,"This movie is a little-known gem from the Boulton Brothers, British filmmakers who produced a string of comedies in the late 50s to early 60s. While it is a gem its only flaw is that the parts  the individual ingredients   are greater than the film as a whole. The ingredients, though, are noteworthy:

1. Terry Thomas. He has the starring role. Any movie with TT is worth watching, because he was the embodiment of what Monty Python later would call, the Upper Class Twit. With noble stature, controlled aplomb speech, and dignified manner, he symbolized a Britain which was fast becoming extinct, yet, gleefully clueless.

2. Peter Sellers. This is PS in his movie teenage years. He is still finding his voice, searching for his satiric self, looking for that role where it would all come together  i.e., Jacquac Clousseau.  His accent in this movie is a strange one, a cross between Spanish, French and Italian. He is definitely earning his movie bones in this one, and he is a delight to watch.

3. Post-WWII metaphor of England. Briefly this movie concerns the UK making overtures to a long-standing but long-forgotten ally, a tiny, insignificant island in the Mediterranean. When natural resources are found on the island, UK engineers a division of the island through the United Nations, to gain control of the portion containing the resources. Then, UK finds out that they do not control the portion containing the resources  and go back to the UN to withdraw their request to divide the island. Mainly due to the fact that these actions are carried out by an incompetent diplomat (TT) they can do nothing right.

4. Cold War Allegory. Because this film was made during the height of the Cold War, Russia and the United States get involved. The more they view the confusion in the situation, both sides conclude that it all is not worth it.

The film also features a very young Ian Banner and a gorgeous Luciana Paluzzi. Well worth watching.",1361923200,,1949,4.7880597014925375

1804881,4,B00007AJE6,"""Carlton-Browne of the F.O."" is an hilarious effort by the Boulting Brothers, those masters at skewering British life after the war. This one aims a bullseye at Cold War intrigue, the British Diplomatic Service and the United Nations. The Amazon Review perfectly captures the essence of the sometimes confusing plot but does not do justice to the superb cast, headed by Terry Thomas as the dimwitted Minister, Raymond Huntley as his boss, Peter Sellers as the crooked public servent etc. The script is so full of satire that this is a film which requires a few viewings to catch all the barbs. Note too the cameo by one of my favourites, Irene Handle, as the typical English housewife - hysterical!

Most importantly, the print is immaculate but the only extra is a biography of Peter Sellers which can be viewed on the screen and is refreshingly realistic about his limitations and temperament. A commentary would have been welcome because there are so many stories to tell about the cast and the Boultings themselves.",1285459200,,1019,4.890173410404624
1804882,3,B00007AJE6,"CARLTON-BROWNE OF THE F.O. (1959) is a Terry-Thomas film that's best remembered for co-star Peter Sellers. Billed as a comedy, this rather dry Cold War picture has few laughs, mostly from sight gags like a collapsed reviewing stand or a gout-bandaged leg bumping into things.

Thomas is an unambitious foreign office liason. Disdained by his boss, he's sent to obscure Gallardia, an island nation divided north and south following their king's death. Sellers is the duplicitous prime minister negotiating for a best personal deal with both the Soviets and the U.K. He also plays both sides in a brewing revolution.

A subplot which ultimately takes center stage is the new king's romance with a princess who is also supported for the throne. The story's a muddle of intrigue and shady deals that ends with the lovers married and the baddies in exile. Kind of a bore, it's complicated by clipped accents, rapid-pace dialogue and too much political detail. For Sellers completists only.

1804884,4,B00007AJE6,"It's a little disingenuous to promote this film as a Peter Sellers vehicle because he is essentially a bit player here as the corrupt prime minister of the neglected British outpost of Gaillardia.  There's nothing here to suggest the immense talent that would emerge in his later work because his part is merely functional.  The funniest thing about him is his costume consisting of white suit and hat, droopy mustache, and greasy hair suggesting a stereotyped banana republic corrupt politico.  As for the film itself it is a fitfully amusing satire of British imperialism and it's role in the new world order dominated by cold war politics.  Terry-Thomas does a nice turn as the bumbling low level Foreign Office functionary sent to quell the winds of change in Gaillardia.  The film probably had more resonance upon it's release but now it stands as a time capsule of British politics circa 1958.",1129075200,3,899,4.927152317880795

1804914,5,B00007AJE6,"This is a very funny British movie made for British audiences.  Even though it was released in the U.S. as The Man in the Cocked Hat, the humor is very British - and not the Benny Hill kind.  It immediately reminded me of The Mouse That Roared, released later in 1959, and also starring Peter Sellers.  The humor in Carleton-Browne is not as universal as that in the Mouse but it is still an entertaining movie.  Our seven year old and I were playing a war game when I told her about the troops in the movie attacking their own headquarters.  She thought that very funny as do I.",1454976000,2,579,4.275229357798165

1804926,3,B00007AJE6,"This is the sort of farce that was comment in the 1950s and early 1960s. The movie is listed in imdb.com as ""Man in a Cocked Hat"" with the original title ""Carlton-Browne of the F.O."" F.O. standing for the British Foreign Office. The story is about how British and the Soviets are making a big fuss over a small backwards nation somewhere on the map. Peter Sellers appears in this movie in a role that predates his role in ""The Mouse that Roared""
In this movie he plays a corrupt minister of the island nation. As advisor to the king he takes every chance to ingratiate himself to whomever seems most profitable. Sellers plays a minor role in the movie.
Terry-Thomas plays the titular character an ineffective and clueless government official. Who stumbles his way to success.
The real star of the movie is Ian Bannen who plays the young king Louis. Playing opposite as the Princess Ilyena is Luciana Paluzzi. She plays the niece of the ruler of the northern half of the nation.

For those of you who have never seen either a Peter Sellers film or have never heard of the great Terry Thomas, I would recommend it. Mr. Sellers has an amazing ability to satirize the thought process of those in charge, second to none, a skill he puts to use in this story, while Mr. Thomas delivers a fine performance, in doing something other than his typecast role.
