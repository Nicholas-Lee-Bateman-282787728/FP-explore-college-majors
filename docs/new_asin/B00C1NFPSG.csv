5685960,5,B00C1NFPSG,"I have been using Heidi Butkus' Sing and Spell Sight Words for several years, and it has made a huge difference in how quickly my kindergarten kids have learned to read and spell those tricky sight words.  Nor only do they sing along, but it also gives them a ""wiggle break"" as they do the motions.  And the bonus ""I'm Done"" song has been a great help in helping them remember the period at the end. We love Heidisongs!",1364601600,8,419,4.291139240506329
5685961,5,B00C1NFPSG,I have used the DVD on first grade spelling phonics patterns for two years and my class would beg for them each day.  They loved moving and singing as they learned.  It provided variety and fun in our learning day.  Now I am switching to kindergarten I can't wait to try some of Heidi's other DVDs.,1435795200,,298,4.285714285714286
5685962,1,B00C1NFPSG,"I purchased this product based on the great reviews. My son loves music and dancing and sounded like it would be a great product for him! Unfortunately, it was not! I tried doing the dances with him but the boring lady doing basic silly movements did not keep his attention! Perhaps it is better for a class setting where 20 kids are doing it at the same time. Definitely not a good product for home use.",1435622400,,404,4.328947368421052
5685963,5,B00C1NFPSG,"The teacher next door used the Sing and Spell video with her kindergartners last school year. The kids loved it, plus it helped them with writing and reading, so I decided to purchase a video for my class. This product is great for brain breaks.",1435017600,,245,4.466666666666667
5685964,5,B00C1NFPSG,We love it!,1432684800,,11,3.0
5685965,5,B00C1NFPSG,It's everything I hoped for,1429401600,,27,4.6
5685966,5,B00C1NFPSG,The songs are very catchy and my five year old seems to be picking up the sight words faster with this video than with flashcards. It is worth the purchase.,1425772800,,156,4.233333333333333
5685967,4,B00C1NFPSG,Great home resource!,1420588800,,20,6.0
5685968,4,B00C1NFPSG,"I'm seeing great results with these dvd's, but wish there were more options to make using them easier.  I'd like to be able to adjust playback speed. I wish it would not play the introductory music in a constant loop on the main menu page (makes it hard to get it up and running in advance unless I have the sound off on my computer, but then I can't use my computer for anything else that requires sound. The other option is to launch the dvd right as I need to use it, which takes awhile.)  I'd also like to be able to save a copy to my computer so I wouldn't need to insert the disc.

I only took off one star for these issues, because, except for the speed of the playback, the convenience issues are not a reflection on how well these songs work to help kinders remember sight word spelling.  They work awesomely - (I need to practice the songs slower without the dvd with my second language learners, but they are learning, too!)",1419120000,2,935,4.235955056179775
5685969,5,B00C1NFPSG,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Heidi's ""Sing & Spell the Sight Words"" dvds! My students are learning their sight words AND having a fabulous time learning them - singing the catchy songs, using their bodies to dance and doing the motions, listening to and watching Heidi, reaching all of my students each with their unique learning styles. I strongly recommend ""inviting"" Miss Heidi into your classrooms today!!!",1417046400,2,398,5.138461538461539
5685970,5,B00C1NFPSG,Thank you! Lots of fun and held the children's attention!,1415145600,,57,4.8
5685971,5,B00C1NFPSG,My students love these videos!,1410825600,,30,5.2
5685972,5,B00C1NFPSG,This is a great dvd full of sight word songs.  I had the cd for years but only recently got the dvd.  It is really wonderful.  My kids get their wiggles out and sing their sight words all at the same time.  They literally beg me for more sight word songs.  They love it.  They are really retaining their sight words this year.  I work at a school that is predominately English Language Learners. I think it is important to integrate movement with song to learn- as well as having great visuals.  This applies to all learners.  When the word pops up at the beginning and end of the song they read it.  They can see the sight words in the background during the song. The tunes and movements are catchy and fun. I truly recommend this product.,1394582400,5,740,4.297101449275362
5685973,5,B00C1NFPSG,Amazingly successful at helping children learn. I have used Miss Heidi's DVD s with K & now with 1st.  The children love and remember her songs.,1394582400,,144,4.538461538461538
5685974,5,B00C1NFPSG,Heidi Songs have helped my kindergarteners learn all of their required words...and they do not even know they are working hard! They think they are just having fun!!! This is the only developmentally appropriate way to help our young learners meet the new rigorous standards! I am so thankful to have found a fun and engaging way for my students to be successful in their reading and writing!,1394582400,,392,4.779411764705882
5685975,5,B00C1NFPSG,My son loved these videos! The rhymes would help him through his writing if he ever got stuck on a word. His whole class loved them!!,1394582400,,133,4.153846153846154
5685976,5,B00C1NFPSG,"My Kindergartners loved Heidi time because they could dance and wiggle.  The more we sang the songs, the more they remembered the words.  I usually picked the words we were working on that week, or the ones they needed the most help with, but we always had to do their favorites too.  I could hear the kids whisper-singing sometimes when they were writing -- great carryover!  And as I told my students, having met Heidi, she was just as nice in person as on the video.

5685977,2,B00C1NFPSG,"I was hoping this would really help my kindergarteners learn their sight words, but most of the songs have too many words and they don't help my kids learn the words. The songs need more repetition so that they learn to spell the word and recognize it. I found most of them too hard to learn myself.",1388966400,,299,4.2631578947368425
5685978,5,B00C1NFPSG,My 31/2 yr old grandson does the Heidi songs at preschool and it is fun to do them with him now at home. They are easy to.follow with just the one woman on the screen. I highly recommend them all if you have a very active little one!!,1388880000,2,234,3.8958333333333335
5685979,1,B00C1NFPSG,"Not only did the students stare blankly but they couldn't get all the different moves so they gave up.
The lady is very boring wearing mom-pants and is in the same setting over and over again.",1387065600,4,192,4.361111111111111
5685980,5,B00C1NFPSG,I teach transitional kindergarten. My scholars love watching it and are learning the words. When they use these words in writing they sing out their words. I plan on buying the rest in the series.,1377302400,7,196,4.628571428571429

8576296,5,B00C1NFPSG,Heidi Songs are loved in my classroom!  Good quality DVD.,1488585600,,57,4.7
8576297,5,B00C1NFPSG,"Everything Heidi Songs does is awesome! There are catchy jingles and motions for dozens of sight words on this DVD. I love that the songs emphasize spelling the words, not just identifying them. I highly recommend this product, as well as her Sounds Fun DVD, which focus on phonics/digraphs like ch, sh, aw, in addition to her Letter sounds DVD, which has songs and movement for each letter of the alphabet.",1481328000,,407,4.746478873239437

8576300,5,B00C1NFPSG,"I work with students with ADHD, Autism and communication disorders, and they love these songs. They are learning to read and spell, and it is helping them with letter identification as well. I have one student who has been non-verbal and he has started singing along.  Truely a wonderful, fun, and engaging product. :)",1457222400,,318,4.888888888888889
8576301,5,B00C1NFPSG,great deal.  Need a bundle package,1453075200,,34,4.666666666666667
8576302,5,B00C1NFPSG,"My 4 and 5 year old sing these words often.  My 16 mo old is watching siblings and dvd carefully.  I expect him to start spelling when he can identify the alphabet.  (He's already moving his body mimicking the movements from classroom management dvd also by Heidi Butkus).  Did I mention I'm a kg teacher?  Also a hit with my ESL, which became ELL (English Language Learner) and now ENL (English as a New Language) kids... They need something to catch their attention; singing and dancing to these catchy tunes really help them remember the spelling.  Great DVD.  Wish I had the funds to buy all her dvds.",1451520000,,605,4.546296296296297
8576303,5,B00C1NFPSG,"I have a home daycare with children birth to five and we received this dvd as a gift last Christmas and most of the children can sing, spell and read the first twenty words from this dvd. Heidi also has free extension activities on her website that support learning these twenty-six sight words. I am purchasing volume 2 today :)",1442966400,,329,4.5
