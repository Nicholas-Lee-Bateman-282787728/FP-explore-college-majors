4600073,3,B0058MXA52,"I recorded the Daniel O'Donnell Live From Nashville program on PBS.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the DVD.  I am very disappointed with the DVD because several songs that were performed on stage and available on the CD version were missing from the DVD version.  The DVD label states ""AS SEEN ON PUBLIC TV"" and that is WRONG WRONG WRONG.  If they can get a 120 minute movie on DVD, they should be able to get 120 minutes of music.",1316044800,22,437,4.228915662650603

4600120,5,B0058MXA52,"Daniel O'Donnell has such an amazing voice, then put that with your favorite country music songs that you grew up listening to and you have a DVD you'll be buying every couple months because you'll wear it out.",1402876800,,210,4.552631578947368

4600122,5,B0058MXA52,"I did not know Daniel O'Donnell until a few months ago when I saw him on LPB. I thought he was a dynamic entertainer. I now have 2 of his DVDs and hope that I can buy more. This DVD is fantastic. It contains good old country music and he makes you feel comfortable. I highly recommend the DVD. Daniel is in a league with Perry Como and Andy Williams, all superb entertainers.",1398211200,,375,4.1506849315068495

4600134,5,B0058MXA52,"He'sngreat and fills our need for great music. We saw him in our area a few years ago annd this is the next thing to being there. Very well, done. Some videos do too much moving the camers all over the place and you get dizzy watching. This one doesn't do that. Some movement but, not bad.",1396224000,,289,4.087719298245614

4600137,5,B0058MXA52,Have ag great appreciation for Daniel's music and shows. Just took in one of his shows in Branson and as usual is great entertainment for 3 hours. His band members and back up singers are fantastic. The quality of music from having band with him for over 20 years makes for enjoyable music listening,1384992000,,299,4.555555555555555
4600138,5,B0058MXA52,"Daniel is the best entertainer. He sings for all generations. I love his smile, wink, and no one else dances as he sings these songs.

4600143,5,B0058MXA52,I am a confirmed Daniel O'Donnell fan. I first watched and listened to this DVD when it was loaned to me by a sister in law and I enjoyed it so much I just had to buy it. Being of the older age group ( late 70s) I have always been a lover of traditional country music ( no time for new country) and I really liked the selection of songs presented on this DVD most of them ones that I have enjoyed listening to over the years from many of the country greats. He has a beautiful voice and has the ability to connect with the audience in the way not many singers are able to do. He is a showman which adds to the enjoyment of watching him. The duets with Mary Duff are very good and she is such a great singer as well. Nashvile. Volume Two will be my next purchase.,1370736000,,762,3.92258064516129
4600154,5,B0058MXA52,It showed up at my door sooner then I thought. I bought this for an Easter gift for a friend. The packaging was new and the DVD played as it should. No complaints.,1366329600,,163,3.9696969696969697

4600158,4,B0058MXA52,"This is a good DVD but I was disappointed. I have most of the DVD's from Daniel O'Donnel and I now have Volume 2 Live from Nashville.  In my humble opinion, Both are missing something. I don't know what and maybe it is just me. He sings and dances as good as always. I have Daniel O'Donnel Live from Branson which I used as my comparison. There is NO comparison!  Live from Branson is fantastic. Live from Nashville is good. Both volume one and volume two are just good. I will always buy Daniel's DVD's. I think he is a fantastic entertainer and can sing anything. I have seen him in person and his show was wonderful.",1335484800,3,619,4.282051282051282

4600163,5,B0058MXA52,"Today this DVD arrived, and I just finished enjoying it immensely.  Daniel was at his most personable, fantastic, adorable, handsome, and talented best for this PBS special from the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. He could not have appeared more happy to finally have his delayed-a-year-due-to-flooding 'Nashville Dream' come true.  For his fans, it was worth waiting for, and I do not think I could ever tire of watching it.  The filming, lighting, and choice of music made me wish it could never end. Memorable songs were ""Red is the Rose"", ""Mother's Birthday Song"", and ""Praying"", though every song is wonderful.

Possibly, though I have not read or heard, are we to hopefully have a ""Volume Two"" with the additional music recorded that evening, since this was labeled ""Volumn One""?  Some of it is on his Nashville CD.  That is certainly something to look forward to also.

Mary Duff sang two special songs and another with Daniel and looked as beautiful as ever.  And Majella, Daniel's lovely and talented wife, looked fabulous and sang with Daniel the beautiful ""Eternal Love"" and a solo seeming to feel right at home on stage.  Both are certainly wonderful complements to Daniel.  I do not want to forget the wonderful band and the two ladies singing backup, who also make the show so enjoyable.

What dream is next, Daniel?  I can hardly wait!",1316476800,7,1349,4.868421052631579
