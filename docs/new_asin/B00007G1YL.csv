1808941,5,B00007G1YL,"I too remember seeing this documentary on England's Channel 4 and was immediately impressed by the understated tone that let the central characters speak for themselves and the horror that slowly unravels as the snow continues to fall.
It's rare to find a product that receives so many five stars and be so justified.",1089763200,4,317,4.888888888888889
1808942,5,B00007G1YL,"Murder happened in the Sierra-Nevada mountains in the winter of 1946/1947. This is the story of the fabled Donner Party. The heroes were the indian guides who refused to eat human flesh, and were murdered for it. Heroes also were the members of the four rescue parties who fought the worst winter on record to save lives. Heroes were all those who did not forsake humanity to survive. Survival alone isn't worth compromising what your life is supposed to mean. The villains in this story are those who killed to live. This is an astonishingly vivid depiction that draws emotions to the surface and makes you ask: What if? What if just a few of the decisions were slightly altered? And what if it were you up there?",1069804800,,714,4.5859375
1808943,5,B00007G1YL,"Highly recommended.
A very matter-of-fact approach to describing the tragic story of the Donner party. Heavy reliance on actual diaries and notes those involved. I thought it demonstrated the strength of the human spirit but, more evident, the strength of the women. While many of the men went nuts, several of the mothers somehow manaaged to keep themselves and their children alive.
So many twists and turns you would think it was made up. A women watches her husbands heart being cooked on a stick. Failed rescue parties. And, in the ultimate irony, the only member who publicly admitted to the cannibalism ended up opening a restaurant.
Cons: Not long enough. Not enough use of maps - would have liked to see more big-picture mapping of events.",1068336000,3,748,4.897637795275591
1808944,5,B00007G1YL,"The Donner Party has to be one of the best documentaries ever made, a tale of impossible hardship, a journey that tests the human endurance and puts a new meaning to the words, survival instinct.
I first watched the Donner Party on UK's Channel 4, way back in '92, with the title 'Death of a Wagon Train', and it really blew my mind, and I have been searching since then for it to no avail, until quite recently when I was pleasently surprised by its release on DVD. Thanks PBS.
In a way, we should consider ourselves lucky, for despite the atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty that palgues the 21st century, our age offers us vast technological advances that makes life much easier in all aspects. Yet we do take so much for granted, for there was another time, a time of continious struggles to survive. The 1840s in the States was also, I would imagine a very exciting time, for along with the difficulties, there were dreams to seek a better life and fulfil them through uncharted and virgin territories, a vasteness that can devour as much as lead to 'eldorado'. The 'eldorado' in question was California, and emigrants way before the Gold Rush of the 1850s, rushed there to improve their lot and seek their fortunes. These people were really brave! To decide to leave the certainty of their established lives, and jump into the unknown needed a lot of courage! But it is this courage that made the emigrants of the Mayflower leave Plymouth, and it is this courage that made America the great power that it is today.
The Donner party was one of the unlucky ones, who decided against the advise of a more experienced tracker,to take a shorter route to 'eldorado',a mistake that would cost most of them their lives, and would push some to the darkest recesses of the human soul. While many emigrants successfully made it to California and rebuild their lives and rewritten the country's history in the process, most are fogotten. The fate of Donner Party on the other hand is not, not only because most failed to reach their destination, but because of the horrors that they experienced trying.
Ric Burns brilliantly captures this ill fated journey, through the letters of both the dead and few survivors (perfectly read with an errie tone), soundbites from historians (just a few), and beautiful cinematography that captures the beauty and hostility of the landscape. Brian Keane adds so much power with his gorgeous music.(I am still waiting for the soundtrack to be released, it is worth it!!!)
You have to buy the Donner Party and look in awe and fascination at the courage of early emigrants, and in sheer terror at the tests that the human being is put under and the lenght that he/she will go to to survive. Scary Indeed!",1059609600,4,2732,4.69375

1809006,5,B00007G1YL,"I first watched the American Experience documentary ""The Donner Party"" when it debuted on PBS in 1992. I came away so deeply stunned I thought about the film for days, if not weeks. I never knew just how unimaginably horrifying this tragedy was. You think you've read and seen everything about man's historic suffering, and then comes the Donner Party. This is not just an incident about cannibalism, but an excruciatingly endless march of families, women and children suffering on American soil. It's a tale without peer, genuinely avoided because of its deeply disturbing exposure of the potential darkness of humanity.

Written and directed by Ric Burns, brother of Ken Burns of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Burns-The-Civil-War-Commemorative-Edition/dp/B004AR4WSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Burns: The Civil War (Commemorative Edition)</a>&nbsp;fame, I consider ""The Donner Party"" to be one of the greatest documentaries ever made. It is a haunting testament to the endurance of man, faced with unfathomable deprivation because of a series of 2-3 misguided decisions. With the exception of a handful of very good books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordeal-by-Hunger-The-Story-of-the-Donner-Party/dp/0395611598/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperate-Passage-The-Donner-Party-s-Perilous-Journey-West/dp/0195383311/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperate Passage: The Donner Party's Perilous Journey West</a>), the Donner Party's 1846-47 pioneer disaster has barely a contemporary document detailing the subject, and narrator David McCullough states as much in the introduction, ""This documentary is a first.""

The production values are magnificent, with haunting footage of the vast American landscape skirting the Oregon Trail. The deep snows of the Sierra Nevada mountains have rarely been so menacing, appearing so cold as to give viewers chills. The musical score, part synthesizer and piano mixed with authentic rural riffs, creates an intensely simmering dread, as if tragedy is following these doomed souls like the darkest of clouds. ""Turn back,"" you keep saying. ""Turn back!"" But they don't.

The authentic, contemporary photographs are equally moody, detailing the shadows of 19th century souls near Truckee Lake, lounging as if in thought about all that unfolded during the unforgivable winter of 1846-47. The narration from diaries and letters of members of the wagon train are earnestly read by a series of great actors including Eli Wallach, Amy Madigan, Timothy Hutton, J.D. Cannon and Frances Sternhagen, bringing the varied and complicated emotions to life. The historians, or the ""talking heads,"" are unusually perceptive, with Harold Schindler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Another-Time/dp/0874212421/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Another Time</a>) providing some of the most straightforward and unforgettable quotes.

American Experience's documentary ""The Donner Party"" is a masterpiece, an appropriate revelation of domestic catastrophe. There's truly not enough time within the film's 90 minutes to cover all that happened (the documentary inspired me to read several books on the subject), but the major incidents are covered and no punches are pulled. It's an unblinking creation of what happened to these souls. So much so, this could potentially give young children nightmares.

They were 87 pioneers who entered the American west with dreams and ambitions. By journey's end, almost half had died, with many resorting to ""survival cannibalism"" to avoid starvation and the loneliest of deaths. Some Donner Party members and their rescuers were heroic, others perhaps not. But as you sit in the warm hearth of urban comfort while this heartbreaking drama unfolds, you will shiver at its revealing essence. You will realize, ""There but for the grace of God, go I.""",1467244800,3,4045,6.360655737704918

Hubris and heroism, foolishness and brilliance, violence and grace, and the whole range of humanity seems to have existed in this little party of people trying to reach California in the 1840s.

Ric Burns does a terrific job, using diaries and letters to establish clear and distinct individual voices and perspectives on exactly what happened on that tragic journey. Among the fascinating facts, more women and children survived than grown men, and it seems it wasn't only because the men took more on. It also appears that, while physically stronger, the men were often mentally weaker.

This is a mesmerizing account put together and told from firsthand accounts of the events that transpired during the Donner Party's trip to the wild west from the east. Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Every bad decision that could be made, was made.

This is gripping, suspenseful, sad, horrible. The suffering these people endured is unbelievable, especially the women and children. The firsthand accounts from letters and journals and oft told tales, lend a very personal experience to what the group went through.

I had seen this documentary on PBS many, many years  ago and thought it was an excellent depiction about the Donner Party and their plight.  I enjoyed it then and still enjoy it now, though I wished the outcome had been one of triumph rather than trial, tribulation, and ultimately death.  Yet, the outcome of their journey is what it is and will remain in the annals of history as one of the most horrific and horrifying events of human endeavor.  This video is of the same caliber as that of Ken Burns' ""The West"", ""The Civil War"", and ""Prohibition"", and is loaded with plenty of information though not nearly as long.

1809096,5,B00007G1YL,"PBS's long-running documentary series ""The American Experience"" had provided a huge mine for all who are deeply interested in our country's rich history.  One aspect of that history is in the big westward migration of the mid-19th century that eventually led to the northwestern part of what was once Mexico coming under American control.  And of all the stories of that part of our history, none has been as heartbreaking, poignant, or shocking as that of the Donner Party, that emigrant wagon train that, through several fatal mistakes, the biggest of which was taking a cut-off through the Utah mountains and the Great Salt Lake Desert, found itself stranded during the harsh winter of 1846-47 in the Sierra Nevada, only one hundred fifty miles short of their final goal--Sutter's Fort in Sacramento, California.

As documented by Ric Burns, brother of Ken Burns, THE DONNER PARTY recounts how two prominent families of Springfield, Illinois, led by James Reed and George Donner, decided to make that long 2500-mile track west to California in order to make a better life for themselves.  With narration by David McCullough, and excerpts of diaries read by people like Eli Wallach, Amy Madigan, J.D. Cannon, and others, we get a sense of the roughness and danger of the cross-country journey, and how much more dangerous it got when the Reeds and the Donners made the catastrophic mistake of listening to the advice of an ambitious would-be ""emperor"" named Lansford Hastings and took a shortcut across rugged terrain that could only be accessible on horseback and certainly not in a wagon.  The party lost almost an entire summer making that dangerous ""shortcut"" that actually turned out to be much longer and much more treacherous than the established path.  And while they reached the foot of the Sierras in the last week of October in what was thought to be enough time left to cross the pass that would eventually be named for them, they unfortunately got caught in an early blizzard, losing their race with the weather by one single day.  What happened over the next five months in the Sierras remains one of the greatest tragedies ever experienced in the annals of human history.

Of course, the most notorious aspect of this entire story is the fact that many of the survivors were forced to resort to cannibalism; and that part of the story isn't ignored.  But what the documentary also explores is the fact that so many of the men in that party perished, and that two-thirds of the women and children were able to make it out of there alive; that James Reed, who had been banished after having killed a teamster, found, much to his amazement, that his wife and four children had survived; and that nine snowstorms enveloped the mountains during that winter, hindering the fourth and final rescue party by an entire month.  Historians Joseph King, Wallace Stegner, Harold Schindler, and Donald Buck, also comment on what the saga can teach us about the limits of human experience and can-do American optimism, and how it can be tripped up, fatally in the case of the Donner Party, by not listening to sage advice being given by those who knew better, including James Clyman, the mountain man who had advised his old friend Reed to take the established path to California and not take Hastings' cut-off.

What is most heartbreaking, of course, is that, when one comes down to it, the people in the Donner Party really weren't any different from us.  They knew nothing more about the virgin territory they were stepping off into than those whom they followed; and while in hindsight it's easy to say that they should not have trusted the bogus statements of Lansford Hastings, who is to say that we wouldn't have acted any differently if we had been in their shoes at that time?  This documentary poses that question, and many others, to us as we watch the tragic and horrifying saga unfold over a ninety-minute running time.  It is one of the greatest and most tragic sagas in our nation's history, and one that, without this documentary film, many people would probably still have a lot of the wrong ideas about.",1360108800,,4123,4.8215297450424925

1809127,5,B00007G1YL,"In the late 1970s, I did a foolhardy thing. Armed with a used $10 Argus SLR camera, I walked through a blizzard in downtown New Haven, taking b&w snapshots of the havoc that a raging storm could cause. As afternoon turned to evening, winds grew to near-hurricane strength and pushed me toward home, three miles up Whitney Ave. Had the gusts blown in my face instead of on my back, I might've died from exposure. As it was, I barely made it to safety after two hours of struggle. The backs of my legs were bright red and numb to the touch for a full day. I'd escaped frostbite by inches.

Having first-hand experience of the blinding snow, bitter cold and fierce gusts of a blizzard, and the pain these cause, I cannot imagine how any of the Donner Party's remaining 46 survived NINE such blasts, way up in the Sierras where the temps are much lower, with no food and little shelter, for nearly five long months. Drifts 20 feet deep... it's incomprehensible!

Everything seemed to conspire against these emigrants to California: bad advice on a ""short-cut"" that proved longer by far and more treacherous, a band of attacking Indians that killed much of their cattle, and a snowfall that closed the mountain pass only one day before they reached it. Had their small wagon train left Missouri just a little earlier or taken the well-worn, proven path by the Great Salt Lake. If they'd only rested their oxen four instead of five days before making that last push up the pass...

So many what ifs, so much tragedy.

The starving were forced to strip what little flesh that remained from the dead, cook and eat it, just to survive.  And yet, some time after the ordeal, Virginia Reid claimed in a letter to a cousin that her family were the only ones that didn't resort to cannibalism. How is it possible to go all that time without food and still have everyone in your family survive, while death and the unthinkable is all around you?

Just one of the unasked questions this 90 minute AMERICAN EXPERIENCE documentary leaves us with. Narrated by  David McCullough, and with the voice contributions of Amy Madigan, Eli Wallach, George Plimpton, Timothy Hutton and others, this 1992 episode of that long-running PBS series remains one of its very best.

Written and directed by Ric Burns, who uses antique photos (obviously post-1846), newspaper and other print relics, plus survivng letters to tell this most harrowing of stories, which is summed up in its last moment by the quote that tops this review.

""The Donner Party"" is a show not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. It's also a cautionary tale of Mother Nature's hazards I wished I'd known about back in 1978.",1334534400,14,2674,4.660297239915074

1809129,5,B00007G1YL,"I first watched this documentary when I ordered the Time-Life ""American Experience"" series on VHS more than 15 years ago. I finally found it on DVD and, though I had to pay more than usual, I just had to have it. This is why:

1-The research is thorough and rich in detail; especially with the use of authentic pictures, letters and journal entries from the time period.

2-The experts used in telling the history were great story-tellers and very knowledgeable.

3-Using actors to voice the various characters and further the story was fantastic. It really made the story more dramatic; if that's even possible.

It isn't surprising that Ric Burns, the director, is the brother of documentarian Ken Burns (""The Civil War"", ""The War""). They have a very similar style and it's fantastic. You really get a personal feel of the story and it just comes alive more than most documentaries. You really feel for everyone on a strong, human level. I've watched it often and I attribute this documentary to awakening a genre preference I didn't have before.",1330128000,9,1048,4.837988826815643

1809131,4,B00007G1YL,"One might ask, why was this group of tenderfoot emigrants known as a ""party?""  They had no cake, wore no funny hats, sang no songs, tippled no champagne.  Rather, they set out on a long trek from Illinois to California and met with disaster.  If most people know anything about the group, they know simply that they were reduced to canibalism to stay alive.

This video does an excellent job of describing the group and the perils they faced--including misrepresentations by a self-styled expert and the worst blizzard the California mountains ever experienced.  Not all were named Donner, despite the program title.  About half of them survived the ordeal and went on to become citizens of California.  The story is dramatic in the extreme--and that's where the fault lies, perhaps.  The facts alone were sufficient to claim the watcher's full attention, but the voices-over, in providing words from diaries and other accounts, almost whisper in an attempt to lend more drama to words that could have stood alone quite well.  And that's why four stars, not five.  The attempt to punch up the drama was annoying.  I wish that choice had not been made by Mr. Burns.",1320105600,,1164,4.8578680203045685

I remember watching it on PBS when it aired and this DVD brought to mind also the book I had just recently read called Desperate Passage. While these are actors reading excerpts from various diaries and recollections of some of the survivors of the Donner Party it still seemed so real. You can't expect a 90-minute spexcial to go into the depth a long book can as to all that the early pioneers endured just reaching the passage leading over the Sierra Nevada Mountains in 1846, let alone what one terrible winter did to those holed up in cabins, lean-tos, or holes dug into the snow itself. Add to that the fearful conditions the four different rescue parties had to cope with just to reach the survivors, and you get an idea of what these humans perished from, and triumphed against. The weak, tired voices you listen to, and the somber music, make this a chilling retelling of this tragedy in our history. Just as an afterthought on the timeline, I read A Terrible Glory right after finisheing Desperate Passage and was interested to learn the Battle of Little Bighorn took place only 30 years later, in 1876.",1257465600,10,1215,4.577981651376147

I later bought the VHS tape and recently got the DVD from Amazon.  The Burns brothers are excellent story tellers through their films and Ric Burns is just as much a master documentarian as his famous brother Ken.  The story of the Donner Party is haunting, their tragic ordeal seemed almost as if it was predestined.  This is one of the best documentaries ever made.  The movie has a 'you are there' feeling to it, the actors' voices sound believable and are well matched.  Even the music carries a sense of hopelessness and doom hanging like a dark shadow over the whole tale.  If you like watching history on film, you definiately want to see this one.
