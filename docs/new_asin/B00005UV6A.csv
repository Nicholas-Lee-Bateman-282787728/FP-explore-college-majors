No disappointments here.  Unfortunately for the band giving a live performance, there seemed to be about 12 people in the audience.  Gee, what a waste of a really great live performance.  Glad we got this one on tape!",1150243200,13,380,4.5
1668774,5,B00005UV6A,"A wonderful last snapshot of the unbelievable talents of Buddy Rich.  A delight to watch and listen to, a must for Buddy Rich fans.  If you want to see the ultimate perfectionist, a master at work, watch this!  Swings like crazy!",1143072000,18,229,4.536585365853658
1668775,5,B00005UV6A,"I'm sure everyone that had heard BR play before knows that he is the best drummer by far. So I'm not going to accentuate that fact again here. What I do want to says is that the recording & audio quality of this DVD is one of the best I'd heard. When I first played the dvd and the main menu's music came up (it's a fragment of one of BR solos), my jaw just drop to the floor `cus is was just like having BRich playing in my living room, and I know about drum set in the living room , my dad is a drummer from that era.
Some people mention ""muddy/thin"" sound on this dvd,...all I can say is , you're missing the point completely. The idea is to get a truly Big Band sound `al natural, without any type of eq/effects/amplification. This is not a radical novel concept; this is the way classical music has been recorded since, er, for ever. You just don't close mic every violin, cello bass and every tympani,  the sound will be very unnatural.  In my opinion, the engineers did a superb job on this recording.",1086048000,,1008,4.164102564102564
1668776,5,B00005UV6A,"I have been playing for 32 years and I have never seen anyone close to Mr. Rich. I can still recall all ten concerts of his I attended,and can truthfully say that in the 17 years that he has been dead, I still consider him the 'worlds greatest drummer'. Case closed!",1072915200,,266,4.235294117647059
1668777,3,B00005UV6A,"It is always a pleasure seeing the worlds greatest drummer play. The only problem with this video is that his playing although great in it is not by any means a true representation of the unique, special & unmatched fire that Buddy Rich was blessed with. Certains things in life are unexplainable, Buddy's gift is one of them. This video doesn't show that, although it is very enjoyable.",1028246400,2,387,4.705882352941177
1668778,5,B00005UV6A,"It was thought these tapes were lost in a fire and have not been commercially available for 10 years or more.  This is a wonder of current technology that these tapes have been recovered and restored.  Originally released in 1985 on Cafe Records as a double-CD set (Mobile Fidelity Labs) and on Beta Hi-Fi, this is one-half of the recording session.... The West Side Story Set.  The other, hopefully,  (The Channel One Set) will be restored as well.  I'll be first in line!  This was ""State of the Art"" recording for its time.  The recording was done on the SQ/Tate Surround System, which was left in 4-channel format when transferred to this DVD into DolbyDigital 4.0 and DTS 4.0.  The producers, obviously, felt that going the 5.1 route would mess to much with the original sound.  Not to worry.  It's the best available recording yet of Rich and his mastery of the drums. The microphones are arrays set back to capture a live feel.  Some may prefer the up-close technique, but that does produce a clinical studio sound.  This sounds like you are sitting in the audience.  The seven video cameras have slik-stockings stretched over the lenses to achieve a ""soft film feel"".  I'm not crazy about that, but hey, I am so happy to have this on DVD I'll gladly forget about that.  Eight tunes comprise the set, topped by West Side Story and 2 solos by Rich.  Even at 67, Rich was a blaze of speed and played everything in front of him.  Watch his second ""West Side"" solo as he sticks the bass drum, the rims, and even the sticks themselves!  A legend and the best drummer of all time.  Don't think about it..... BUY IT.",1019088000,18,1616,4.529411764705882
1668779,5,B00005UV6A,"If you love Big Band jazz like it's supposed to be, big bad and dirty!!!! You'll love this. Buddy's band is just as I remember seeing it, tight and groovy. The only dissappointment is that Buddy is not with us anylonger. I wish I could bring my son to see him as my dad did with me. Thank You for giving us this true treasure. I am alive again......

1668780,5,B00005UV6A,"This DVD is simply fantastic! The West Side Story Set has NEVER been commercially available before this and is a MUST for every Buddy Rich fan or anyone who desires to see a genius play a set of drums unlike any other. The band is wailing and the extra family interviews, backstage clips, and interview with Buddy himself, it's worth the purchase price alone besides the concert! The audio/video transfer to DVD is A-1 and I only hope that the Channel One Set is also released on DVD soon! This disc is so hot, I have two copies! Highly recommended!",1006732800,5,549,4.5
1668781,5,B00005UV6A,"""I have been waiting for this dvd and it was worth the wait. The audio is crisp and clear. The picture is so much better than any of the videos out there and Buddy's performance is outstanding. There are great shots of Buddy throughout. The song accessing is a great feature and the way the solos of each musician can be gotten to makes the disc a lot of fun. The commentary
from his wife and daughter was a great touch and I enjoyed the photo archives.
It shows Buddy performing some of his finest music. I recommend it to anyone interested in Buddy Rich, great jazz music, or the drumming of one of the masters.""",1006732800,9,614,4.301724137931035

7955506,5,B00005UV6A,Buddy at his best.  The producer's created a nightclub in a factory for this DVD and set up a number of cameras and special sound systems.  Only a handfull of people were there for a magnificent performance by Rich and his band.  The last ten minutes of this video has shots of him doing amazing work. The perspiration rolls of him as we watch from different angles.  Even the commentaries are worth watching after you've viewed the concert.  If you are a Buddy Rich fan this DVD is a definite must.,1168387200,10,499,4.43956043956044
