8590834,5,B004047XVQ,"I can write a review about this show,  because I'm one of the few people who has watched it already.  I bought the VHS tapes, and the Laserdiscs.  I am very happy that these are going to be released. With my limited, at the time, knowledge of Japanese in 2004, I totally enjoyed this anime.
  It is a little risque,  with very occasional nudity , but the hi jinks of Yokishima are great!!  And who gets tired of watching redheads in pole dancers one pieces?  They showed it in Mexico where it was a huge hit, but they cut out all the dirty parts!! I am sure the translators will clean up some of the lines, as there is a bit of cursing.  The American translators always seem to clean them up in commercial releases,  so unless you know you're Japanese curses, you will miss some of them.  A good idea would be a adult script that had the
dirtier jokes in it.  That could be password blocked so the kiddies won't see them.
  The stories are very varied.  Some are very sad,  like the tennis pro one.  Others are downright hilarious.  It is one of the most brightly colored animes I have watched as in terms of the Backgrounds.  My favorite episode is the one where yokoshima gets Dragonball like powers.  There are tons of other good episodes.
  I hope the transfer is of decent quality!!
  Enjoy everyone!!!
