Great for high school and even grade school children.",1517961600,2,296,4.285714285714286
5832961,5,B00DMB8J84,Awesome series. I loved it.,1517788800,,27,4.6
5832962,3,B00DMB8J84,"Short ""chapters"".  Educational but pedantic.  How the Universe Works and Hyperspace with SAm Neil are favorites.  But the best is Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.",1458432000,,162,5.4
5832963,5,B00DMB8J84,Excellent all the way around. I would buy from them again. Very satisfied overall.,1414713600,,82,4.928571428571429
5832964,3,B00DMB8J84,"I think this series could work in some secondary education earth/space science classes.  The content is fairly up-to-date.  For visuals, well done computer graphics are heavily used,  although some sequences are reused in some episodes.  The narration is straight forward.  The background music is quite diverse, so you will not be hearing the same artist playing the same song all the time.  However, in a few episodes the sound level of the background music is louder than the narration.  One thing that holds down the rating in my opinion is the DVD home/title menu screen.  The longer episode titles are cut off by edge of the screen!  This can make it difficult to determine what episode you have selected!  I think that a ""Play All"" episodes option would have made a good addition to the DVD home/title menu screen!",1385856000,,821,4.841726618705036
8594425,5,B00DMB8J84,"This has got to be one of the best things about film these days. I love this amazingly produced and informative show. Not only is it beautiful, it showcases wondrous and current content regularly. My only complaint is I wish they came out with an episode every day. There is so much space going on!
This is one I watch time and time again, all the episodes. Bravo! Encore Forever!",1529884800,,380,4.442857142857143
8594426,3,B00DMB8J84,"Ep 5 at about 17:10 the narrator confidently states that ""One to the power of thirty... [is] one followed by thirty zeros"". I'm no astrophysicist, but even a grade school mathematician knows that one to the power of thirty is... one. The graphics are cool, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired.",1523664000,,300,4.574074074074074
8594427,5,B00DMB8J84,I really liked how graphics intense this series was.  Lots of great visualizations and images.  No scientists babbling on with their knowledgeable mug on the screen. ;),1521417600,,168,5.185185185185185

8594429,5,B00DMB8J84,"A few dated pieces of info, but on the whole, it's a wonderful collection relatively short and concise pieces of info on a variety of space related topics.",1520035200,2,155,4.571428571428571
8594430,3,B00DMB8J84,"This is just a rip off of the ""Faster Than Light"" Documentary ... or maybe it is the other way around. Either way, the material is the same in one as it is the other, so don't waste your time of the other if you have seen the one...",1519516800,,232,3.7551020408163267
8594431,1,B00DMB8J84,"We've never witneseed any real footage / video of any shuttle docking with the ISS or any launch of any rocket, shuttle etc from start to reaching orbit ever. Its always stopped or interrupted with clever or distracting excuses beccause of the firmament. If I'm wrong, show me any 180 degree video panning of any space walk ever. Its because its all fisheye lensed round Earth BS, there is no 4th wall, the same as any TV set, the 4th wall in space is the production angle, its not real. Prove me wrong, I'll be the first to eat crow, stand corrected if you find real footage.",1518825600,,576,4.392523364485982
8594432,2,B00DMB8J84,Couldn't continue watching because the writing is so bad.,1518652800,,57,5.444444444444445
