5972898,4,B00FA9CIKG,"In the aftermath of the Kage Summit, Sakura is determined to kill Sasuke, by herself. She realizes her ""love"" for Sasuke was only based on his looks and physical prowess. She is seeing that Naruto has a beautiful soul; she was unfairly burdening him, by expecting Naruto to keep his promise of bringing Sasuke back to the Leaf village, alive and well, at his own peril.
We learn Danzo did indeed order Sasuke's older brother, Itachi,  to assassinate the Uchiha clan. However, was it for the benefit of the Leaf or himself? Danzo stole the Sharingan from several of the Uchiha and plans to use them to defeat Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Obito Uchiha (Tobi, Madara) is present to add color commentary to the fight.
Meanwhile, the now aligned ninja lands are preparing for the fourth great ninja war against the Akatsuke.
This set shows a lot of fighting and a lot of introspect into the REAL feelings Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke have for each other and for themselves.
This set is not to be missed by any Naruto fan.
The DVDs are dubbed in English, but text has not been translated. This makes for difficulty if you can't read Japanese. This includes episode titles and signage and other text items in the episodes.
It would also be nice if more than 13 episodes were included in a set.
As a personal gripe, I don't like that the episodes are split into two parts each.",1389830400,2,1368,4.560975609756097

5972931,3,B00FA9CIKG,"Since so many other people have covered all the high points, let me just touch on the more frustrating aspects of this box set. I'm on episode eight of the twelve, and so far not a single one of them has held new content through and through. Every episode so far has either shown excessively extensive flashbacks (that we've already seen countless, numerous times over the course of the anime) or else started so far into the prior episode that you feel like you only have to watch half. I was truly hoping for more new content, more plot progression, but it feels too much like all I'm getting is rehash after rehash of what I've seen before. Not too happy, but I'm too invested in it now to stop, and I guess that's how they get you.",1392854400,5,735,4.333333333333333

5972936,5,B00FA9CIKG,"I bought this because I have the previous box sets of Naruto & Naruto Shippuden. This box set was terrific, finally Sasuke fought against Danzo & anyone who has beaten the game of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 knows what happens. That battle was truly intense & Sasuke also fights Naruto again briefly, Kisame battles with the 8 tails Jinchuriki Killer Bee. Which was a great battle also & more of the story was revealed.",1390780800,,432,4.697368421052632
5972937,3,B00FA9CIKG,"I wanted to like this set cause a lot did get done.

So I feel like I watched the same episode over and over and over.",1390694400,,326,4.508474576271187
