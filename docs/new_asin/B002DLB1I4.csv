3911657,3,B002DLB1I4,"First of all, I've been watching and enjoying Eddie Izzard for a long time. He is hilarious, most of the time. This set does have some moments that are funny, but it is not his best work. I've never been put off by his outfits in the past, or the make-up or any of that. The outfit he wears for this set though is truly an eyesore, the point of distraction. It's just gaudy. He's got a miniskirt, fake boobs, and a long coat that just does not work. It truly is difficult to get past it. As Eddie himself has said, it's 90% how you look and only 10% what you say. Eddie, this outfit is awful! The comedy was just not that good. I don't think I'll spend much time watching this set, although I've seen some of his other shows many, many times over.",1257292800,5,747,4.08843537414966
3911658,5,B002DLB1I4,"This guy is hilarious. He is able to bring comedy to subjects that people normally wouldn't touch, such as religion and Star Wars into stories that will make you wet your pants.

And even Americans can enjoy it! This isn't dry British comedy, it's simply a funny guy in drag with a British accent.
You will not be disappointed by this DVD and the fact that it was recorded at Wembley makes it all the better.

Might I add, he performs better in heels than I do.",1257292800,4,461,4.287356321839081
3911659,5,B002DLB1I4,"I bought this DVD and I because I am an Eddie Izzard fan, I also have Sexie and this is a completely different set and a different venue. Any body who is a fan of Eddie will enjoy this immensely...as I did and it is incredible to see him perform on stage at a venue as iconic as WEMBLEY ARENA! I would recommend this to anyone.",1257206400,28,327,3.9696969696969697
3911660,5,B002DLB1I4,"Eddie is simply one of the funniest and most innovative comedians out there.  He's very much a comedian for real comedy fans delivering sharp, witty punch lines.  I was lucky enough to see him play Wembley and this would be a great dvd for both those familiar with and new to experience Eddie.",1257120000,,293,4.509433962264151
3911661,3,B002DLB1I4,"I'm writing this two months before the release of the DVD and I'm posting this so people will have an idea as to what this is since its not clear.

This appears to be a version of Eddie Izzard's show Sexie from 2003 which was never released on DVD here in the US (This was taken at different performances of the show). This is probably a good thing since the region 2 DVD of Sexie seems to be Eddie on an off night

I saw the Sexie show a couple of times when it played live in the US and it really was a mixed bag. the first night I saw it I found it absolutely hysterically funny. The second night was less as good. The import DVD wasn't all that good. Much of the material performed has to do with Eddie's film career and when it works its very funny. I'm guessing that this is going to be worth picking up for any one who is a fan of Eddie's stand up because many of the bits are choice even if the show over all isn't great. Besides even allowing that this was recorded at a different series of shows than the original DVD, Eddie's shows are never the same, he's always changing bits, indeed even his recorded shows are never the same with the audio tape, CDs and video recordings of his early shows all being different.

(Thank you to Auntie Momo at Cake or Death for seconding my suspicions)",1251590400,91,1298,4.142857142857143

It's interesting to see the roots of some of his best routines. However, the picture you see on the cover just isn't the same entertainer. And that's referred to as ""A Bait And Switch Scam"".

3911676,5,B002DLB1I4,"This is great comedic entertainment! He provides barrels full of laughs while hitting on issues such as old legends, myths, and dentistry.  He does a great job taking cues from the audience and running with their responses.

His outfits may be a bit much for some people but he is definitely worth watching - I highly recommend watching all his stuff!!",1397347200,,352,4.754098360655738
3911677,4,B002DLB1I4,"Classic Eddie Izzard fun. Eddie is my all-time favorite comedian. A thinking man/woman's wit. Live performance filmed over the 4 night sold-out show at Wembley Stadium.

3911679,4,B002DLB1I4,"Eddie Izzard is a comedic genius - I love his shows and his movies.  This one was more frenetic than usual, but rippingly, incredibly humorous!  He says the most outrageous things (and mostly basically true!);  he's fantastic to watch and listen to.  Talk about shaking up (and taking on) the Establishment!  You go, Eddie!

3911684,2,B002DLB1I4,"Bought this just because my entire Eddie collection is still being shipped over to our new home and it was about the only one I hadn't already got.

Was somewhat disappointed to find that it is basically just another performance from the Sexie tour. One or two different bits as you always find watching Eddie on different nights but not really enough to justify this being released.

If you own Sexie on DVD, don't buy this. If you don't own Sexie, buy it as it's a better performance.",1350259200,4,486,4.511363636363637
3911685,5,B002DLB1I4,"This DVD is another winner from the comic genius of Eddie Izzard.  In one of his biggest venues, Izzard holds nothing  back, leaving your sides aching from laughing so often and so hard.  Fantastic, clever, witty...and funny as all get out.  I dare you not to laugh.",1347321600,,266,4.595744680851064
3911686,5,B002DLB1I4,"Live from Wembley is a pinnacle performance by the British ""Executive Transvestite"" comedian Eddie Izzard from his Sexie tour. Unlike the eponymous release, Live from Wembley features Eddie on form and the audience in the palm of his hand.

Eddie's performance is wonderfully energetic and imaginative. Unlike the performance of Circle - which had brilliant material but Eddie was a bit too self-conscious that night - Live from Wembley features Eddie with a great stage presence and swagger. The material is wonderfully diverse, and Eddie's pantomime and train of thought is hilarious and a riot to follow. Eddie covers everything from Neanderthals to Medusa's hairdresser, from sharks to disco flies, and back again.

This is Eddie at his best. Stripped is a more average show with lesser delivery (although Live from Madison Square Garden is to that tour what Live from Wembley is to Sexie). While not on par with Definite Article, Glorious or Dress to Kill, Live from Wembley is a riot of a time that had me in fits of (almost quite literally) non-stop laughter. The hour-and-a-half you invest in it flies by, and you better try your best to keep up with Eddie.",1346371200,,1165,4.938775510204081
3911687,5,B002DLB1I4,This is an unfair review since I am a big fan of Eddie Izzard.  He can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.  I've traveled far and wide to see him live (but only to locales I've never been).  Not a stalker by any stretch of the imagination.  He's a lovely man inhabiting this planet with us and we are lucky to have him.,1331769600,,320,3.876923076923077

3911689,5,B002DLB1I4,This was one of the best shows he's put on and we own most of his shows on DVD's and one CD. He is one of the wittiest showmen around today.

3911692,3,B002DLB1I4,"I had high hopes for this to come out. I've seen this material live, and suffered through watching it in small chunks on YouTube, because for some unknown reason, it won't be released in Region 1 format(same deal for the Stripped DVD). But this performance isn't as good as the one captured on Sexie. Eddie is all over the place and he has added anecdotes from the American leg which fall flat(encore with that boring story about the western movie -- yawn). Eddie was at the end of touring this material and he seems tired of it as well. The bonus Work-in-Progress set isn't even all that compelling either. Release Sexie and Stripped now.",1273708800,2,639,4.614035087719298
3911693,5,B002DLB1I4,This performance is a hardcore Izzard fan-pleaser...delivers laugh after laugh just like Dress to Kill.,1273104000,2,103,5.933333333333334
3911694,5,B002DLB1I4,"I love this show. Dress to kill is my favorite, and this ties with Glorious. The auditory component to his pantomimes has really become strong; it adds a cool new layer.",1272153600,2,169,4.483870967741935
3911695,4,B002DLB1I4,"When Sexie came around in the U.S. I saw it live, and it was AMAZING.  I laughed so hard for hours, and could have continued for more.  When ""Sexie"" was released as a DVD in the UK, I purchased a copy.  Yes, this DVD was funny, yet not as good as live, nor as good as this ""Live from Wembley"" copy.  However, I'm extremely disappointed that they changed the name.  I had no idea this was exactly what I already owned, and now since I've opened the package I cannot return it.  I will say the quality is better, and his delivery is too in this edition.  Eddie is a favorite of my household, and I love his work dearly.  It is the marketing here that is wrong!",1265155200,5,658,4.0859375
3911696,5,B002DLB1I4,"As an Eddie Izzard fanatic, I was pretty thrilled upon hearing a new DVD was coming out. However, this is more or less the same show as on the DVD ""Sexie"", but made for American DVD players. I don't think Sexie was released for America (even though I did buy it and watch it on a friend's player), so it's nice to have a port of this. It's still awesome to see Izzard work his way through a set in his unique way and to see him reach his jokes in a more roundabout way. Highly recommended, but don't expect brand new material.",1264550400,2,526,4.116504854368932
3911697,3,B002DLB1I4,"If you are a die-hard Izzard fan, you'll probably want to see this and may even really like it. Of all the Izzard DVD performances, however (I've been a fan since long before Dressed to Kill), this is by far my least favorite. There are some funny bits, but the material just isn't fresh and the show is uneven, compared to previous shows. I have the Region 2 version of Sexie and this DVD. Not thrilled with either. I saw Stripped last year live. It was hilarious--brilliant. I'm looking forward to a Stripped DVD and the Stripped II live show.",1263513600,4,545,4.46
3911698,5,B002DLB1I4,"Anyone who has ever seen Eddie Izzard will love this one. He's funny, funny, funny. If you have never seen him, you're missing out. Will watch this over and over.",1262995200,,162,4.433333333333334
3911699,5,B002DLB1I4,"Yet another great example of Eddie Izzard's brilliant humor!  Seems to be a version of the SEXIE tour and is just as wonderful as I remember it being live!  If you like Eddie, this will not disappoint!",1262822400,,201,4.405405405405405
3911700,5,B002DLB1I4,"I'm a longtime and big Izzard fan, but I was a bit worried I'd find the Wembley show disappointing after reading a fair number of mixed reviews here.  I'm happy to report that Wembley's among the best DVDs he's released.  I'd say a couple notches below ""Dress to Kill"" (what isn't?) and on par with ""Glorious.""  To be more specific, I disagree with both of the main concerns people mentioned:

1) ""Eddie seemed nervous at the start"": didn't get that in the slightest... his opening few minutes (about his breasts) are among the funniest, and are certainly no more manic or free-associative than he normally is.

2) ""The audience wasn't as into it"": I think people are responding to the fact that, since it's a stadium show, the sound of the audience is bigger, but more diffuse and removed than a hemmed-in theater crowd.  Once you get used to that sound difference, it's clear that they're every bit as on board as usual.

Buy the Wembley show without fear--it's hilarious.",1262822400,11,974,4.694117647058824
3911701,3,B002DLB1I4,"Eddie, got to love him. He's the funniest comic ever but saying that this DVD was not his best. What I think most people miss is that he was very nervous.  He was very hyper at the start. He didn't settle down for 20 minutes or more. One of Eddie's true gifts is his ability to take his time to tell a joke and during that time the audience becomes completely invested in everything he has to say. He owns us. He was possibly nervous because most of his audience had never seen him with his breasts. Maybe he wasn't sure how he would be accepted. The spiked heels seemed to be a problem for him. He seemed to have a great deal of difficulty standing up or standing still in them or maybe that was also just part of being nervous. The film quality was not as good as his other DVDs. All in all my husband and I always LOVE Eddie. We would like to see him get some leading rolls in film. He's fabulous.",1261785600,3,900,4.084745762711864

Unlike all the other DVD's there are no subtitles or closed captions.  It looks like they put a lot of money and effort into this production, why couldn't the spend the extra couple of $ to put subtitles on it?  It makes very me angry at the production company and sad to not be able to enjoy the show.",1259971200,23,450,4.044943820224719

3911707,3,B002DLB1I4,"I am an absolute true fan of Eddie Izzard's work and was very anxious to view this DVD.  As most of his fans, I know his work well; seen him in person (well, I was in the same room...sometimes one hears more than one sees) and have all his released works.  Favourites:  Unrepeatable, Definite Article, even Live at the Ambassadors, Dressed to Kill and the others.  What makes his DVDs so enjoyable to me are his Commentaries.  I very much enjoy hearing his point of views after the fact...that is he comments sometimes two/three years after performance and chuckles along with you over his missteps, highs, lows, providing an entertaining back drop.  The background from these ""Specials"" add so much flavour to him and the appreciation for his pieces.  What is more fun to watch than Lust for Glorius or Dress to Circle en francais or the fantastic Je Suis Un Stand-up, Eddie Izzard Abroad!  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the early DVDs but I thought this was rushed, not his best work, maybe released in advance of his UK/USA tours and the promotion tour on the Coastal states for his Believe release which will be a general release in late January.  I personally am sorry to see his show go so large in such huge venues like for me the United Center and Madison Square Garden in New York.  The comedy gets lost; the intimacy...he uses his countenance and physicality when he works and all of that goes missing on those large screens..I pay to see him on stage.  I don't want that nth delay while watching him work...I'd rather just watch my DVDs at home.  I love that he has become such an amazing success but his is a different median; is it necessary that he be a Comedy Jock Star!  Am hopeful Believe will assuage my disappointment with Live from Wembley.",1259539200,3,1753,4.562300319488818
