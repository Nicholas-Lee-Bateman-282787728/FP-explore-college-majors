690358,3,630362751X,"Although I like Shemp, this one is not quite as funny as some of them.  But it has its moments.  It is always fun to see the other actors and realize how much they support the Stooges' routines.  I also found interesting the roles the women play in the routines.  The women range from dominating types to submissive types.  Even with all the Liberation, people seem to be much the same as they were back in the 1940s. Just as there is nowadays, back then there were wimpy men and overly aggressive women as portrayed in the skits.  It seems very arrogant of modern day people both men and women to be blind to those that have suffered and gone on before us.",1397433600,,657,4.300813008130081
690359,5,630362751X,"Shemp, some call him the fourth stooge, must get married by 6 pm TODAY if he I to inherit half-a-million-dollars (how many millions would that be in today's dollars? many!!)

Nobody wants to marry him, that is, they don't when they don't know about the money. But once they find out that he'll inherit the money, everyone wants to marry him.

Even though this is a spoiler, it does not ruin the ""short"". What makes the Three Stooges priceless is their comedy style, their mix of verbal and physical humor.

Sometimes, it is painful to watch their humor, but it is still funny, you could say painfully funny.

Of course, I enjoy all their humor, in small pieces at a time.",1393459200,,671,4.520661157024794

690362,5,630362751X,"I was never a 'Shemp' fan, always looked forward to Curly in every episode. But make no mistake, Shemp is the star in this episode and it's one of the funniest Stooge clips of them all. It's a classic by itself, and any Stooge fan who misses this episode is missing out on some great fun and laughs. My favorite scene is when the Preacher says (2 or 3 times), ""Hold hands you lovebirds!"". One time he has a bird cage crashed over his head by a fickle woman for saying that. It's a hilarious episode!",1383091200,,499,4.208333333333333
