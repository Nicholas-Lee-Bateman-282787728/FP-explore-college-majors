7875384,2,6304682107,"Much of this DVD is delivered in a thick British (Australian?) accent by the male speaker. The woman is clearer, at least for us non-Brits. The planning and content of the spoken material also seems haphazard and poorly thought out. For a better Tarot DVD, get ""Rider-Waite: Learning to Read the Tarot Intuitively.""",1179014400,7,315,4.962264150943396
7875385,3,6304682107,"This cassete is an introduction to tarot, and is equivalent to a first frontal lecture in a tarot course. It is a bit over 30 minutes long, and uses the time well.
It speaks *about* tarot, rather than *how* to use it, and does a reasonable job of that, but with a few problems :
* The presentation of tarot's history is [bad], and many unbased legends about it's origins are presented, e.g. that tarot cards were used to tell fortunes right from the time of it's invention, which has little factual basis, or that the Egyptians got their wisdom from aliens.
* For some reason the cassete goes into the cartouche deck, which beside being a deck of cards has little to do with tarot. IMO, the time would have been better used to go a little deeper into tarot.
On the positive side :
* the cassete shows several decks (though without the decks' names), allowing viewers to get an impression of what kinds of decks are available.
* It covers the structure of the deck (major & minor arcana, the four suites, numbered cards & court cards, the general meanings of each suite, a few keywords for cards, etc).
* It shows actual tarot reading sessions by a knowledgeable & solid reader, which gives a good picture to both readees and people who want to become readers an example of what a good reading is.
This cassete is good as very first introduction to tarot, but not much more. My main objection is that it's not worth it's price, except maybe for tarot teachers who want to use it instead of passing the equivalent material in a frontal lecture.",980208000,8,1542,4.471631205673759
