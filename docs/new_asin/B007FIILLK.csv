8515797,3,B007FIILLK,Ostrich Egg Carving needs to be more detailed. Video is good quality .Would like to see more of this work to get a better feel for carving.,1403654400,,139,4.185185185185185
8515798,1,B007FIILLK,very poor quality video that is very hard to watch. I would not recommend this to anyone who is a first time carver as they would probably become very discouraged with the idea of egg carving.,1358208000,3,192,4.361111111111111
8515799,3,B007FIILLK,Great teacher but poor camera work. Not for beginning egg carvers. Knowing what I know now I would rather have bought the DVD or not at all. After download it keeps stopping and you must start all over again. If you have experence carving eggs & want to learn from one of the best carvers around order the DVD not the download. Save your money.,1332892800,5,344,4.3076923076923075
