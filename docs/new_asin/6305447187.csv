1065886,4,6305447187,"I liked this movie and thought it was very good but my husband absolutely adored it, which is why we saw it twice.  In post WWII Texas, virtually every man in town is in love with Patricia Arquette's character.  ""Obsessed"" might be a better word.  This includes the poorer men of town, recently returned from the war, played by Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup, as well as the richer ones.  She married one of the rich, older but unattractive men during the war, caring solely for the money and security he offered her. Stephen Frears, the writer-director, has made a career out of doomed love and lust stories though and this one is no exception.  I preferred his ""Dangerous Liaisons"" though, probably his best piece of writing, and with the high watt talent of Glenn Close and John Malkovich.  I liked his ""My Beautiful Launderette"" about as much as this film, which featured an unknown Daniel Day-Lewis, wearing a mohawk hairstyle, playing a young gay man in present day London vis a vis a young Pakistani man whose family owns launderettes.  Frears always works with very high caliber acting talent and Hi-Lo Country is no exception.  Harrelson has been doing excellent work for a very long time and doesn't disappoint here. Crudup was new to me and I liked him the best as both actor and character in the film.  I think you may have to be a man to fully appreciate Arquette.  In any event, this is well worth trying out.

1065887,5,6305447187,"Set in the late 40's in New Mexico, HI-LO COUNTRY has the nostalgic beauty of things passed. Pete and Big boy live in the traditional cow-boy way ; hard days in the company of cows and horses in the tough new mexican  climate, heavy drinking in the bars of the towns at night and the usual  women & rodeos cocktail on week-ends. But this life cannot last for  ever. Progress, lawmen and fast money are killing little by little one of  the most enduring american dream.
Director Stephen Frears opposes in  HI-LO COUNTRY these two different ways of life that can't live together.  Curiously enough, the new generation is prompter to use guns in order to  solve problems and young senoritas are far more rational than the sons of  John Wayne. But one thing doesn't change in the turmoil of time : nature  and its breath-taking beauty.
HI-LO COUNTRY is a beautiful movie, an out  of time movie which can reconcile you with true cinema. Note the wonderful  musical score which explores with subtlety different atmospheres :  country-music, folkloric tunes and lyrical LEGENDS OF THE FALL-like  themes.

1065888,5,6305447187,"What critics can't understand is that this is the way these ranch people were and still are. I was partly brought up on a ranch in West Texas, near the Hi Lo country in New Mexico. Ranch People really do have names like big  boy and little boy and often speak in a slow taciturn way like Billy's  character. And there are a few wild ones like the Woody Harrelson  character. What the film portrays is the genuine hardness of life and human  relationships in this lonely stark ranching environment, which was even  more so in the time portrayed. I have met all these characters many times  in real life and this film touched my heart for a way of life which is  still painfully dying. The film is a great slice of American life. I will  be interested in seeing what the same critics make of the soon to be  released All the Pretty Horses, similar in many ways and also filmed in New  Mexico. Critics,  how about some respect for new Westerns that do not star  Clint Eastwood and lots of violence or showcase sentimental Robert Redford?",937872000,29,1034,4.412698412698413
1065889,5,6305447187,"This movie stands shoulder to shoulder with ""Giant"" and ""The Last Picture Show.""  Woody Harrelson has a power that matches any male performance, anytime, anywhere.  This is twentieth-century  Texas and New Mexico, as anyone who is familiar with that region will know.  The dialogue is at all times poetic and haunting, particularly the barroom  scene where ""Big Boy"" speaks with Greek eloquence about  the  ""bottom"" possessed by a Bucephalas-like horse named ""Old  Sorrel.""
It is inexplicable why this movie is not being spoken of as  a great classic.

1066131,3,6305447187,"Max Evans' fine modernist Western novel fairly begged to be filmed, and no actor wears a Stetson so rakishly as Woody Harrelson. But Stephen Frears' involvement in this project defies belief (even Ang Lee might have been an apter directorial choice). The film is, frankly, a mess which trashes Evans' tighter, more coherent book. Frears is completely disengaged and rather unsympathetic to the principals in the love triangle, and any film that wastes Penelope Cruz, or Sam Elliott's magisterial authority, is beneath contempt. Speaking of contempt, even the not dissimilar and fluffy Cruz film ALL THE PRETTY HORSES with its borderlands landscapes and fine performances by Bruce Dern and Miriam Colon is a far better postwar Western than this.

Still I own this product--for Harrelson's valor (and Crudup's fine too), for Sam Elliott, and for the unheralded cameos, late in their storied lives, by two country/honkytonk legends, Don Walser (""the Pavarotti of the plains"") and Rose Maddox, too briefly glimpsed as feisty Granny and nicely channeling Beulah Bondi. The great Katy Jurado pops up briefly as a bruja, and the quickie rodeo sequence gets some authenticity from Ty Murray, Rob Smets and Bob Tallman.

HI-LO COUNTRY is certainly worth a look for Max Evans readers, Harrelson fans, and admirers of the New Mexico landscape (cf. John M. Stahl's LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN), but Frears' followers will be crestfallen and the stiff list price is not justified.",1392508800,,1459,5.177966101694915

Its also one of those disks that will refuse to track accurately in your player so that its impossible to tell where you are and how much is left to play.

A horse opera that begins with a cowboy getting thrown from a standing horse. Doesnt sound like a propitious beginning, does it? Woody Harrelson gives his usual over-the-top performance. Billy Cruddup on the other hand is understated as always, the kind of actor who inhabits his part without drawing attention to himself. The two make uncomfortable partners in style and in this movie. Billys character gives background narration throughout. The movie left me feeling uncomfortable as if something is missing but I just cant put my finger on it.

Shot in 1998 at a time when Woody still had hair on his head. Cowboy Westerns were well past their heyday and open range worked by men on horseback had become a thing of the past. For the price this disk is well worth the price of admission.

Possible spoilers

Narrated by Billy Crudup one of those actors whose name you may remember seeing in a list of performers but most would find difficulty in identifying. I think it would be safe to say he has a love/hate relationship with Hollywood--it's where you go to make the movies but you don't want to get drawn in too tight. After all he refused the lead in Titanic to play a movie few have probably seen.

Ironic that at 6 1 Cole Hauser who plays Little Boy towers over his brother Big Boy. This movie turns the classic love triangle into a quadrangle as our two principals share an interest in another man's wife. Pete lusts after the unattainable while ignoring the woman who has always truly loved him. Is the baby whose name is to be Pete the child of his seed? Just asking.",1387238400,,1909,4.553935860058309

1066267,5,6305447187,"""...a song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know, Hi Lili, Hi Lili, Hi Lo......""

Hi-Lo country is about New Mexico in the early to mid 1950's, shortly after WWII ended. (it may not have been filmed there, but the landscape chosen fits the beautiful and lonely  N.M. Southwest terrain very authentically) It is a well spun reality tale about enduring friendships, unbending loyalties and ""taking sides"" in the feuds of a ranch country that is beginning to prosper and change with the times but isn't quite there yet; and of two young men (Woody Harrelson as Big Boy Matson and Billy Crudup as Pete) whose fate brought them together early through the sale of a spoiled horse. That particular moment with the horse defined the relationship that ensued between the two boys - even during a first horse trade they were honest with each other, thereby establishing an unusual bond that they both recognized; one a year or so older, dominant but truly genuine under the wildfire, the other younger, quiet and seemingly passive, but that turns out to be ""still water running deep"".

They both end up being attracted to the same woman, Mona (Patricia Arquette). She's not a good woman, either, though of course that's part of the charm. She's also the wife of the ""arrogant without a cause"" Foreman on the spread of the most powerful cattleman in the Hi-Lo country; it's a dangerous place to be and tensions run high - everyone knows what is going on; but the only one gutsy enough to be open about his relationship with the married woman is ""Big Boy"" Matson (Woody Harrelson) He doesn't give a rip what anybody thinks because he is fully capable of taking care of himself. This begins to spin out of control, and Pete and Big Boy are in up to their hats. Sam Elliott is perfect for his role as the stockman sitting back like a vulture, waiting for bankruptcies that he will use to extend his vast land and cattle holdings. He exudes the confidence of a big money cowman and is amused by the foibles going on around him, keeping the pot stirred for the entertainment value.

Woody Harrelson gives an absolutely superb performance as Big Boy, in my opinion. He's entirely comfortable in the part; a stark reality in his understanding of the character he brings to life - and effectively gives us the underside personality of a wild, unruly yet sexually vulnerable cowboy as though he were born to it. It's a complexity that's hard to fathom in someone like Big Boy, and that's what Haralson's talent successfully achieves. ""Big Boy"" also has a shiftless little brother, aptly named ""Little Boy"" who has lived in the shadow of his older brother and all his life and can't compete with him. This is the one person - and he's family - that Big Boy can't handle. He's everything Big Boy is and nothing that he is. The long suffering women of their family have cause to bemoan the uneven genetics of the patriarch (Big and Little Boy's father) of their clan at every turn; it's become their excuse, their lot and is accepted with resignation revealed in the lines on their face.

This movie is very well done in all areas; casting, photography, story concept, lifestyle research, even down to the music that was being played during that time. I thought it excellent entertainment, although somewhat unexpected, under the direction of one of the best, Steven Frears. I highly recommend this for those who are appreciative of good Western film and wants to seek out the best of them - without the lack of understanding of the subject that is so rampant within the genre. It's attempted, but rarely accomplished.",1354060800,,3607,4.656200941915228

1066318,3,6305447187,"Hi-Lo country's plot has already been summarized here a few dozen times, so I'll get right to the element that followed me after I finished this film. The principle friendship, between Crudup's and Harrelson's characters, appear like many of our own at first glance: rock-solid, inseparable, and fixed upon the strongest loyalties. They fight for one another and watch each other's backs like hawks; and yet, when a woman comes into play and divides them, the wheels of their loyalty come unhinged and a crashing course of events takes place.

I found this to be the chief factor of the film, and one that has essentially been the downfall of many friendships in my own circle of influence. Hi-lo country doesn't show us the way it should be when faced with divided loyalties; it shows us the way it actually is, and I applaud the film for that, if nothing else.",1212019200,,862,4.708609271523179

1066321,5,6305447187,"This movie is basically for affectionados of Sam Pekinpah and Walon Green.  The message of this film is that the nature of western life is underscored by the propensity of its people to live with recklessness and violence in generational terms. Think of it as sort of like, ""The Wild Bunch"" aftermath, about forty years beyond.
While the ""Wild Bunch"" was about the west during the period of industrialization around the turn of the century, ""The Hi Lo Country"" deals with the period of superindustrialization following World War II.
Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup play two cowboys who fall for the same woman, Patricia Arquette.  Harrelson as the violent ""Big Boy"" shows no sense of morality or humilty as the film's main protagonist, while Crudup as ""Pete"" is almost the exact opposite. Sam Elliot portrays a villanous rancher/industrialist, while the desirable Penelope Cruz is the overlooked, unrequitted  love in Pete's life.
All of the actors turn in solid performances, but what makes this film special is the story itself, the direction, and Jerry Goldsmith's subtle, forceful soundtrack.",1073865600,4,1097,5.186440677966102

Homesteading cattle is no easy task in the hardpan Hi-Lo country, and certainly no place for the Hollywood glamor factory. Except for a few questionable touches (Sam Elliott's leering villian, for one), the viewer gets a real sense of time and place, and of what goes on with the hard-bitten folks living there. The movie's core, however, remains  Woody Harrelson's Big Boy whose boisterously callous behavior develops so slyly, you may not notice your own shifting responses. The jut-jawed Harrelson is near perfect, as are the cow town atmospherics with their smoky Saturday night honky-tonk. Seldom has anyone gotten a cowboy so right, and seldom has any film blended landscape of place with landscape of character more successfully than this one. Both demonstrate how sheer surface expanse can overwhelm frail emotional depth. Martin Scorese ( a most unlikely source for a Western theme) was a background producer, and I suspect it is he we have to thank for getting this very non-commercial story onto the video screen. Stephen Frears directs at a leisurely but revealing pace, allowing the occasional quiet but necessary moment to creep in. This minor gem should satisfy anyone curious about those obscure backwaters of the American West that appear mysteriously as blank spots on the road map. Despite undeniable concessions, Hi-Lo Country remains truer to its prosaic sources than the mock heroics and contrived mayhem of the traditional western, and is thus well worth a look see. Give it a try.",1042243200,6,1764,5.082758620689655
1066323,3,6305447187,"This character study, set in New Mexico in the early `40s, begins with an enigmatic narrative that infuses ""The Hi-Lo Country,"" directed by Stephen Frears, with a tension that ultimately runs high throughout the entire film.  The story focuses on the friendship between a couple of cowboys, Pete Calder (Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody Harrelson), who upon returning from the war are trying to make a go of the cattle business, while bucking some stiff competition from the local cattle baron, Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott).  At the same time, Pete becomes aware that he is not alone in his obsession with a married woman, Mona (Patricia Arquette); Big Boy has it bad for her, too, and she just happens to be the wife of Jim Ed's foreman, Les Birk (John Diehl).  And, as usually happens with a situation involving obsession, things quickly begin to get sticky for all concerned.  Big Boy, it seems, is the one headed for trouble; he's hot-tempered, stubborn, and fearless to a point bordering on stupidity.  Pete, on the other hand, has a good head on his shoulders and has a couple of things going for him:  One is a woman named Josepha (Penelope Cruz), who cares deeply for him, and the other is his unwavering loyalty to Big Boy.  The tension continues to mount, and the situation is complicated further by the fact that Big Boy isn't exactly discreet about his feelings for Mona, nor of his disdain for Jim Ed Love, for whom his younger brother, Little Boy (Cole Hauser) now works.  Inevitably, things come to a head; but when it happens, the arena in which it transpires is something of a surprise, though not entirely unexpected.
 Frears does a good job of capturing the essence of another time and place that seems so near and yet so far away.  The world was changing around them, but in the Hi-Lo country there were still cowboys who punched cattle and drove the herd to market on horseback.  Theirs is a fairly self-contained world, far removed from anything that is happening elsewhere; if a butterfly flaps it's wings in New York, it isn't going to affect Pete or Big Boy.  Frears takes a look at the difference between the two men, Big Boy, who lives primarily for the moment (or so it would seem), and Pete, who is more apt to consider the consequences of his decisions, except, that is, when it comes to Mona.  But even in that respect, it's Pete who ultimately shows some restraint.  And Frears maintains the tension by keeping the situation between the men and Mona precariously balanced on the fence.  You know that someone is bound to fall, but you don't know who it will be, where or when.
 Crudup is convincing as Pete, bringing him to life with a reserved, understated performance.  He brings an intelligent and introspective quality to the character that leads you to believe that Pete is always cognizant of what is going on around him, and where it's all heading.  With Big boy, on the other hand, you never know if he's ever really aware of his situation, or if he just doesn't care.  As Big Boy, Harrelson gives what may be his best performance ever.  His portrayal is that of a true, rugged individual who keeps his deepest feelings to himself, but just may be a bit more savvy than he lets on.  Initially, it appears that Big Boy and Pete are opposite sides of the same coin, but in the end you realize that they are not so different from one another after all.
 As Mona, Arquette gives a somewhat subdued performance.  Though attractive, she doesn't exactly exude the kind of sensuality that would seemingly elicit the obsessiveness of the men that is called for by the story, especially in Pete's case.  Knowing what you know about the characters involved, it is hard to believe that Pete would look past the lovely and more alluring Josepha for even a second glance at Mona.
 The supporting cast includes James Gammon (Hoover), Darren E. Burrows (Billy), Lane Smith (Steve) and Jacob Vargas (Delfino).  A good, solid drama, ""The Hi-Lo Country"" may not be entirely original, but Frears has a nice touch and gives it a sense of realism that will get you emotionally involved with the characters and their story.  And, upon reflection, it's a glimpse of a world that not that long ago was so much bigger than it is today.",987206400,21,4253,4.636
1066324,5,6305447187,"Returning to the Hi-Lo country of New Mexico after World War II, two cowboys (played by Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup) resume their friendship. That friendship is compromised when both fall hard for the lusty young wife (Patricia Arquette) of a competing ranch's foreman. Crudup is forced to suck it in as Arquette appears to prefer Harrelson; and it poisons the possibility of a relationship with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who detects that his love for her is divided.
 This is the New West, where small ranches are being gobbled up by larger ones such as that run by Sam Elliott, whom the other cowboys hate and fear. The work is hard and dangerous and the rewards few. But the Old West lurks not far beneath the surface, and bullets still fly.
 Director Stephen Frears did a magnificent job with this film. It made we wish that more Westerns were made, even if by ""furriners"" like Frears. Billy Crudup is a young actor whose career I will follow with interest: His restrained role of a man who cannot do what he most wants sticks in the memory. It was good also to see Katy Jurado of HIGH NOON fame in a small scene-stealing walk-on as a Mexican witch, or bruja, who tells fortunes.",977961600,3,1188,4.572769953051643
