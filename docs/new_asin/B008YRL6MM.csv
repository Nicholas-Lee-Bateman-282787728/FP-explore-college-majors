5191342,5,B008YRL6MM,"Sad that you can't get the English dub on netflix or hulu plus anymore? Not sure if you want to drop the cash for all 3 seasons of Sgt. Frog? Maybe this can help...

5191346,5,B008YRL6MM,"for those of you who are hating on sgt frog because u think its repetitive or has bad animation you can all shut the F#### up and stop bein a hater.  you all need to come to terms with the fact that this anime, while it may not be very serious it is one of the funniest most entertaining and best things to happen to Japanese animation.  and if u think i'm being a jerk when i say you need to shut the F### up and stop hating i'm not, i'm merely saying that if you don't like it don't get it just so you can critize it. this goes for anything not just Sgt. Frog.",1358294400,4,562,3.836206896551724
5191347,4,B008YRL6MM,"If you liked the other seasons, you will probably like this too, and for the newcomers: this is a sitcom. A lot of crazy stuff happens but is forgotten in the next episode, where everything returns to normal. There is also a small amount of serious episodes, and I bet most of the fans will enjoy them the most.

But it's still the same procedure: A whole lot of sexual innuendo, mild nudity, sci-fi violence and PG-13 level language. The episodes are more cheaply made this time, so the animation is worse than ever. There aren't as many parodies to other Anime in this season either. A whole lot of the episodes sucks too, I've enjoyed about 1/2 of them!
It's a good set if you are a fan or want to support future seasons, but the episodes aren't really the best ones out there. Get the 1st and 2nd season first.
