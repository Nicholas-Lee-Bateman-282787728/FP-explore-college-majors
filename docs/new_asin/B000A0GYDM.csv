8071502,5,B000A0GYDM,"I loved this DVD.  Not only was it informative and educational, but I thought the moves were very practical and explained well.  Joanne proves her knowledge by demonstrating all the kicks and punches with vigor and self-confidence.  I was attacked several years ago and wish I would have been informed with how to protect myself.  After watching this DVD, I know I am now equipped to deal with an attacker and have gained the confidence to defend myself in a dangerous situation.  I would recommend this to all women.",1161907200,7,517,4.764044943820225
8071503,5,B000A0GYDM,"I was attacked several years ago and did not have the tools to defend myself, either physically or mentally. In this unique DVD, Joanne Harris guides you through powerful combinations to defend yourself in the event of a violent attack. She carefully and with detail demonstrates various highly effective moves that not only provide a great physical workout but boost your self-confidence. After years of searching, I now have a fitness program that has strengthened my body and given me the confidence I needed that was so lacking in my life. I feel less helpless and more prepared, safe and secure. I highly recommend this instructional DVD to anyone who wants to get fit and learn an original and powerful self-defense form. It's amazing, You won't be disappointed!",1161734400,10,768,5.0078125
8071504,3,B000A0GYDM,"This dvd is done by a black belt Joanne Harris on a basic set with pink marble background, very soft, light cheap elecronic music & a guy demonstrating as an attacker in some parts.
There's an introduction how she did martial arts after being mugged & about size not being everything.
There's a demonstration of her responding to attacks w/the video stopping & her narrating what move she used in a combo that is just an overview. There are moves to show how to get out of holds, such as neck holds. She uses basic terminology to name them, such as using two hands as ""batter up"" or ""knee to groin"" she does use palm strikes & elbows which is great.
There is a basic warm-up straight from a 1980s feel with running in place & basic stretches for a good 10 min.
There is the five-star workout which she deonstrates each of the moves more in depth & lets you practice with her a few times for about 20 min.
There is the Links workout which is doing all the moves w/o stopping for explaination for a decent 20 min workout.
It's followed by about a 10 min basic crunch & other similar abdominal workout.
The cooldown is about 3 min.
The menu is pretty good, the lighting & sound is good, just everything is a bit monotonous.
Joanne is great though, she speak a good clip speed, not too fast & gets to the point, no dilly dallying, so you know she understands how long lectures can kill anything.
The only things I wish was more information & her way of demonstrating the moves seems a bit lazy, she doesn't remind you to really use muscle strength & intention when you practice with her. It more seems like relaxed aerobics. She does tell you to watch out for joint locking & to punch THROUGH your target, not at it.
All in all it's good for a short amount of info for those with little time & those who aren't looking for a serious workout or hard moves due to muscle or joint limitations.
For more serious info & more info, get ""Fit to Defend"" it's 2 disks & teaches karate & grappling jujitsu.",1156982400,22,1992,4.314666666666667
