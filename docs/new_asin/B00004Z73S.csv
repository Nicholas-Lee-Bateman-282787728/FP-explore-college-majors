7928318,5,B00004Z73S,"Okay, so I might have been really lucky with some of the workout tapes I've recently chosen, but this is another one I couldn't possibly give less than 5 stars.

Nancy is amazing (and my personal favorite, Minna is in the background) - she has put together three truly effective sets of buns exercises; a few I haven't seen anywhere else before and there are some really amazing combinations as well. She gives perfect cues and is inspiring without being overwhelming.

I don't even remember the last time I did a workout tape and felt it the next day - the first time I did this one, it happened. I could just SO feel my buns. :) I can't tell how effective doing only one ten-minute set at a time is, because I always do all three in a row, but this way it sure works!

Great job, Nancy!",1101772800,2,788,4.275167785234899
7928319,5,B00004Z73S,"I really like this video.  It's fun, and Nancy, Minna, and Julie are great at keeping my interest.  I usually do one or two segments in a day, but maybe soon I'll do all three. :)  My favorite is the third section, which is floor work.  I seem to feel that one the most.  But all three are good, and great for doing on a tight schedule.",1019433600,6,336,3.955223880597015
7928320,4,B00004Z73S,"This is a great workout, if you are short on time and can't workout.  There are 3 ten minute workout routines, I personally enjoy the very first routine and the time goes by so quickly.  This is a great workout for your buns and legs.  I only wish the workouts were at least 15 minutes instead of 10.  However, I am happy with the results that I am starting to see.",1014163200,4,365,4.098591549295775
7928321,4,B00004Z73S,"I own over 25 workout tapes and have to count this one as my latest favorite.  It has 3 individual 10 minute toning sessions that truly work your buttocks area.  I will do one of my aerobic tapes then end with 10 minutes of this tape.
I had hestitated to buy this before as it wasn't one of the ""name brands"" I usually get, but now I am back to order the others in the series.
I work out daily and have to say this one you can feel working.
Also, the women in the tape are not annoying as some can be.  They don't chit chat and there is no wasted time in the video.  10 mins really is 10 mins.
Only wish they would have put 5 10 minute sessions on the tape --for a week's worth of workouts.  Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.",993686400,13,737,3.8543046357615895
