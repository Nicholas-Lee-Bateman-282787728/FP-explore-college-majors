8292911,5,B001DE29TW,"Erik Estrada made a comeback in 1993 in the role of Johnny Villegas in Dos Mujeres Un Camino, one of the most popular telenovelas ever made. There is an inside joke made each time the show comes on, about Estrada's role as Ponch on the popular 1970's American TV comedy-drama CHIPS, when he rides up to the camera on a motorcycle, and takes off his black aviator sunglasses, smiling.

The show stars Mexican songstress Laura Len as Johnny's wife Ana Mara and Bibi Gaytan as Tanya, the young woman who Johnny meets at her father's restaurant and falls in love with, while still in love with his wife. Thus the name Two Women, One Road. It is hard to hate the other woman Tanya (Gaytan) because of her sweetness and the fact that she does not not know Johnny is married right away. When she finds out, she is torn up, loving Johnny while not wanting to hurt his wife, who by the way, she manages to meet up with and become close friends with without either of them knowing that they are in love with the same man. Itati Cantoral plays Graciela - Tanya's best friend.

One of the main subplots in the show is the fact that the head (played very well by Enrique Rocha)of the Montegarzas, a very rich mafia type family is after Johnny because he thinks that Johnny caused the accidental death of his son. A police officer Reymundo, played by Robert Palazuelos and later by Sergio Sendel is in love with Tanya and is working with his partner Angel played by Jorge Salinas to bring down Montegarza.

The story has a surprise ending which I will not reveal so as not to ruin it for those who have not seen it. I enjoyed watching this show back in 1993 and I wish I could find it on DVD, but although it was released on DVD, I have not had any luck finding any available so far.

The late undisputed queen of Tejano singers, Selena, made a couple of guest appearances on the show as did the popular Mexican group Bronco which added to the appeal of the show. The show's theme sung by Bronco was a hit song during the run of the show and earned gold and platinum records.",1284508800,11,2061,4.331606217616581
