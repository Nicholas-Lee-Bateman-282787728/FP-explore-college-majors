448593,5,6302287634,"One cold rainy night in England with nothing to do I turned on my television (only four channels available) and found a new show called Inspector Morse. I have always been a fan of the detective story in print and had read extensively in the genre. Similarly I was a great action buff, with one of my favorites being the Streets of San Francisco (I wonder why that is not available on tape or DVD?).
At first, the pace of the drama was slow and a little bit irritating but I recognised John Thaw from that superb action show, the ""Sweeney"" and Patrick Troughton as the irrepressible second Doctor Who. It did not take long before I was hooked by the simple device of trying to figure out whodunnit. Usually in these things, especially Columbo, it does not take that long to figure out but in this case it was clear that there were red herrings and little cul-de-sacs aplenty to intrigue the viewer.
 The main character was often morose and grumpy, with no time for the trivia of life and did not bear fools gladly. Unlike most other shows, this Morse did not pander to popular culture, utilizing it to sell the show. Instead it was clearly aimed at a more highbrow audience yet through a medium that was often the subject of disdain in those circles.
Pretty soon the two hours of leisurely paced drama was over and that was IT. As I lived near Oxford I sought out the locations on my next visit. It took some time to digest the content of the drama over and above the story itself, the insider's view of the contradictions of the city of Oxford, the juxtaposition of town and gown etc.
But getting back to the story itself. This is more of a movie than a TV show. It is a gripping, compelling piece of police drama set against a backdrop of relative opulence and wealth as well as against a working class city background. It is a story of a dreaming city, of intellectuals and academics, a story of the mundane, of passions and secrets. It is the story of a man of Oxford and at once against the rituals and spectacle that the University has to offer.
At the end of this show, I came quietly. I have had the pleasure to have enjoyed every minute of Morse - being entertained and perplexed until the final moment when the killer is revealed.
This is a great introduction to a marvellous run. One last thought - how measured and appropriate the incidental music and theme are.

For those who haven't seen Morse on PBS or A&E this is a good start because the story has all that a police story needs and does it well.

448595,5,6302287634,"THE DEAD OF JERICO was the first Inspector Morse tale broadcast in the U.S. on 'Mystery Theatre', the series developed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (PBS). For those with an intellectual bent, this series was ""heady"" stuff. Morse is the hard drinking, Wagnerian loving, Jaguar driving, crossword-puzzle working, police officer created by the Oxford writer and acrostics maestro Sir Colin Dexter. Played by the wonderful actor John Thaw, Morse is known only by his last name. His first--Endeavor, for the famous Nelson ship--remains a secret to most. Morse code buried in the theme music by Phelong Barrington spells out M-O-R-S-E.
In THE DEAD OF JERICO, Morse acquires his trusty sidekick, the loveable Lewis played by Kevin Whately, whom, by way of introduction he informs, ""I'm a different kettle of fish."" An intellectual loner, Morse has a less than sucessful way with women, and in THE DEAD OF JERICO his bad luck is evident. His love interest a woman named Anne, played by Gemma Jones (the mother in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and THE WINSLOW BOY, which she also co-produced). Anne is a piano teacher and member of the the Oxford Community Choir along with Morse.
Anne lives in a newly refurbished town house in Jerico, a gentrified neighborhood in the city of Oxford.  After choir practice, Morse walks her home, and occasionally they have a drink in the local pub or she makes him a cup of tea at her place. One day, Anne fails to appear for a scheduled choir performance. When Morse goes to check on her after the concert, he discovers the police have found her dead. Who killed her and why?  Or, did she die by her own hand?  At the beginning, Morse is viewed as an intruder by the officer assigned to the case due to his involvement with the deceased, but soon Morse is placed in charge of the investigation.
This is not a run-of-the-mill mystery. THE DEAD OF JERICO is a wonderful adaptation of one of Colin Dexter's fine books. Anthony Minghella directed this tale, and then went on to direct THE ENGLISH PATIENT, for which he won an Oscar. Kevin Whately (Sergeant Lewis) also had a role in THE ENGLISH PATIENT--as one of the two sappers who defused bombs left by the Nazis.
The DVD version of THE DEAD OF JERICO is outstanding. The cinematograpy is excellent, the color is clear and bright. The film is filled with footage showing the City of Oxford and the University, and if you're an Anglophile you will love this film for these shots alone. Inspector Morse's red Jaguar never looked better--in between repair jobs. I love the Morse series and recommend this DVD for your collection.

Throughout the ""Inspector Morse"" series, the opening and closing music theme spells out M.O.R.S.E. in Morse code. According to composer Barrington Pheloung, in ""The Making of Morse"", in some episodes the Morse codespells out the name of the murderer OR the a cryptic version of the killer's name OR the name of an innocent suspect. If another viewer has a better ear than me, I would love to hear about your discoveries of a Morse episode where the theme music spells out something other than M.O.R.S.E. in Morse code! (I've added a photo of the code for M.O.R.S.E.!)

Dexter has a walk-on in all but three ""Inspector Morse"" episodes.

In the Inspector Morse books, written by Colin Dexter, Sergeant Lewis is in his 60's. Kevin Whately was only 26 when he auditioned, but he was so perfect that he got the part in the TV series. Good thing, given that the series lasted 13 years, and we now get to see Whately's follow-up series, ""Inspector Lewis"" [ Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis ], which I also recommend.

THE DEAD OF JERICHO:
This episode shows us three of what will become Morse hallmarks: He is unlucky in love. He doesn't give out his first name. And when Lewis accompanies Morse to a pub, he usually ends up paying and half the time Morse is ready to go before Lewis is half-started.

Chief Inspector Morse is late to choir practice. He's got his eye on another choir member, Anne Stavely (played by Gemma Jones). He walks her home and she says, ""You know, I don't know your first name.""
Morse, ""That's right.""
Anne, ""So?""
Morse, ""I don't use it.""
""That's silly!""
""It's my parents who were silly.""

Morse shows up at Anne's home to pick her up for their choir concert. The door is open and he calls to her, but he eventually has to go alone. She never shows up, and he finds out why. She's been found hanging in her bedroom. Morse cannot believe that it could be suicide. Detective Sergeant Lewis asks an important question: ""Did Sophocles do it?""

Trivia: Jericho is an area of Oxford. The episode was written by Anthony Minghella, based on Colin Dexter's 5th Morse novel of the same name, originally published in 1981. In this first episode, Lewis (played by Kevin Whately) is attached to Chief Inspector Bell, not Morse. Bell is promoted at the end of the episode, moving up to Superintendent at another branch. This leaves Lewis to move over to work with Morse.

Morse has trouble viewing Anne's body, not only because of his personal association with her, but because Morse has a phobia of dead bodies, which we see throughout the show. He also is scared of heights (hypsophobia) and flying (aerophobia).

THE SILENT WORLD OF NICHOLAS QUINN:
It starts with a Thursday cocktail reception at the Foreign Examination Syndicate. Nicolas Quinn, who works at the syndicate, spends most of the reception trying to adjust his hearing aid. He leaves the reception with another employee, Philip Ogleby, telling Philip that Roope and Tom Bartlett are selling exam secrets.

The following Monday, Quinn's body is found at his home, and Morse is sure that it is murder. Does Morse's law apply? As he tells Lewis: ""You know Morse's Law? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed.""

This is the first episode where we see Morse with one of his passions, crossword puzzles. He interviews Ogleby (played with excellent intelligence and slyness by Michael Gough), and finds out that Ogleby is Daedelus, a demon crossword setter who frequently bedevils Morse with his 5 Down. But, is Ogleby TOO clever?

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on Colin Dexter's 3rd novel of the same name, published in 1977. Dexter knew a bit about deafness. He was a grammar school classics teacher until 1966, when he was forced to retire by the onset of deafness. He then took a post as Senior Assistant Secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE). That's not quite the same as the type of examinations in this episode, but there are similarities.

Colin Dexter is a dedicated crossword puzzler himself. He named his two main characters after his favourite crossword compilers, Sir Jeremy Morse and Mrs. B. Lewis!

SERVICE OF THE ALL DEAD:
Morse and Lewis are called to the church of St. Oswald's. The body of church warden Harry Josephs lies in the vestry, stabbed through the chest. They figure it was done by a tramp named Swan, who was at the service, according to the few congregants who attended. Then Max de Bryn, the rumpled pathologist who admires Morse and meets him head to head, drops a bombshell. Josephs was dead from a large amount of morphine mixed with wine - before he was stabbed. Morse tells Lewis, ""I'm not supposing anything until I've had at least two pints of beer."" Another hallmark of Inspector Morse. A pint, as he says, helps him think.

Morse goes to the church to ask Vicar Lionel Pawlin to come down to the station for questioning. Then follows one of the most memorable scenes in the Morse canon, set to haunting music. (Which scene I won't give away.)

Trivia: This is the first episode, but not the last, where we see Morse's fear of heights. This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on Colin Dexter's 4th novel of the same name, published in 1980.

THE WOLVERCOTE TONGUE:
A tour bus pulls into Oxford. It's a high-end tour with only 12 participants, lead by the tired and disaffected guide, Sheila Williams. She rushes from the bus to meet Dr. Simon Kemp - whose name should be Dr. Shallow - only to have him tell her his wife says he can't see her anymore.

Laura and Eddie Poindexter are on the tour. The Oxford stop is important, because the wealthy Laura is donating the Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology. The tongue is part of an ornate two piece belt buckle, somehow separated after they were dug up together. The Ashmolean already has the buckle. Eddie returns to their Randolph Hotel room to find Laura dead and the Wolvercote Tongue gone. Was it really just a heart attack?

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on a short story by Colin Dexter. In 1992, well after the TV episode first aired, Dexter expanded the short story into a novel titled ""The Jewel That Was Ours"", though there are differences between the novel and the show. This episode is full of lovely wry humor, especially in the interactions between Morse, Lewis and Max de Bryn, the pathologist.

LAST SEEN WEARING:
Morse is grumpy when he's given a new file. It's Valerie Craven, a teenager missing for six months. Lewis is raring to go, trying to give Morse the 3 files compiled on the missing girl, but Morse isn't interested: ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, Lewis, but she's dead.... They put me onto these things when they can smell a corpse. One file - Anybody. Two files - Ainsley or McCay. I'm the three-file man. No, she's dead.""

Another reason Morse is disgusted with the case. He's supposed to solve it, but he's not supposed to bother the family. He interviews the father anyway (which gets him in trouble). Lewis: ""The thing with you is, if somebody tells you you can't do something, you go right on and do it, don't you?""
Morse: ""I make it a rule.""

This is a murder mystery, so there's going to be a body. But will it be Valerie's?

Trivia: This episode was written by Thomas Ellice, based on the 2nd Colin Dexter novel of the same name, published in 1976.

448650,5,6302287634,"I've become an ardent fan of the Inspector Morse series since discovering it about two months ago. I came to Morse by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.

In this first episode in what would become a long-running series, Chief Inspector Morse falls for one the singers in a local choir (of which Morse is also a member). Her name is Anna Stevely (played by Gemma Jones who first impressed me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001ADXWYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection</a>) and she lives alone, making a living as a piano teacher. Morse tries to gently court her, but he senses something is not quite right, not that this puts him off. Well, the romance is short-lived as Anna is found dead, hanging in her kitchen. Is the death suicide, or is it murder?

Morse applies himself diligently to figuring out who Anna really was, and makes some startling discoveries. Anna used to be married and had a child; she also had an affair with her superior at a company she used to work for; there's a rather eccentric student of Anna's who appears to have stolen money from her; there's the peeping tom sleazy neighbor; etc. In what would become trademark Morse, viewers are left trying to figure out who the perpetrator is, and this is never easy as the list of suspects is usually long, and there are red herrings aplenty.

448651,5,6302287634,"The highly acclaimed British police mystery series involving Inspector Morse appeared on British, American, and other countries' TV for years. It began in 1991 and starred the now deceased award-winning actor John Thaw. This DVD is the first episode.

 Morse is an iconoclastic heterodox cop. He follows his own ideas tenaciously and is generally, but not always successful. He uses no first name. He is a heavy drinker, morning, afternoon, and night, especially good beer. He enjoys classical music and singing immensely. He drives a beautiful red car that is involved in two crashes in this film. He is never successful in romance, as shown in this first as well as some later films. His superior officers recognize his usual successes, but he is passed over for promotions because of his investigative methods. Sergeant Lewis begins to work for him during this adventure and remains his frequently overworked sidekick throughout the series.

 Morse meets a beautiful woman who sings with him in a chorus. He is attracted to her and tells her. He dates her a couple of times, when she tells him that she is involved with another man in a strange relationship. Morse mumbles that it was too good to be true. She is found hanging. The police think, but are unsure, that this was a suicide, but no suicide note is found. Although it is not his case, Morse investigates the matter. He develops an unusual theory of suicide involving the Greek classic play by Sophocles Oedipus the King. Viewers will enjoy watching him move from idea to idea, from suspect to suspect, as he resolves what really happened.",1309132800,2,1602,4.8786764705882355

""The Dead of Jericho"" is entry number one of the video taped thirty-three episode great mystery series.  The events that take place throughout this installment foreshadow many of the situations and circumstances we will encounter time and again during the run of the series, i.e.: Intellectual and cultural activities; thwarted romance; various forms of sexuality; the by play between Morse and Lewis; the amicable jousting of Morse and Max; the confrontations between Chief Superintendent Strange and Morse; and let us not forget those sudden plot twists and surprises.  If you haven't experienced Morse, make this your first choice - to set the stage, so to speak.  If you have already experienced Morse - see this next as it will recall some of your favorite elements of this series and add to your enjoyment.

448694,5,6302287634,"The Dead of Jericho, the first episode of the video series of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse, gets the series off to a roaring start!  Filled with local color, an atmosphere of intimacy, wonderful photography, and the best music ever for a mystery series (choral, piano, and opera selections), it completely involves the reader in the action and stimulates interest in the lives of Inspector Morse and Sgt. Lewis. The talented John Thaw, as Inspector Morse, is a man who is passionately interested in music, crossword puzzles, and beer at the pub, but he is also interested in finding a woman who shares his interests.  In this episode, he has made the acquaintance of Anne Stavely, a woman who sings in his chorale and whom he would like to get to know better.

Anne, however, has a painful past history, and she is reluctant to begin a relationship with Morse.  Before Morse finds our more about this, however, Anne Stavely is found hanging in her apartment.  Several plots unwind simultaneously as Morse investigates Anne's death and tries to find who might have wanted to kill her.  A neighbor has been peeping through the window at her;  her boss's wife suspects he has been having an affair with Anne; a young druggie with money problems steals money from Anne.  The producers, however, let the threads develop on their own, leaving the action unclear at first and forcing the viewer to become involved and draw conclusions about how or whether these plot lines may be connected.

This series changes the character of Morse and Sgt. Lewis from the book, where Morse is actually younger than Lewis, and Lewis is more adept at police procedure.  Here Lewis (Kevin Whately) is the perfect foil to Thaw's Morse, less educated and proud of it and willing to do the leg work for Morse.  In this episode, Morse is actually a candidate for police superintendent, with Inspector Bell as his rival.  Max, the coroner, makes an appearance and highlights Morse's queasy stomach in the face of bloodshed and death.  Elegantly produced, with wonderful on-location shots of Oxford neighborhoods and homes, the series starts with a terrific mystery, involving a woman Morse cares for and develops in surprising, dramatic ways.  A worthy debut for a terrific series!  n  Mary Whipple",1159747200,6,2272,4.908376963350785
448695,5,6302287634,"I appreciated seeing the first episode of this long-running series adapting Colin Dexter's fine novels. Seeing how the characters and their relationships were introduced and begun to be developed is helpful to me as I now catch-up with the rest of my Morse education.

The accompanying documentary, ""The Mystery of Morse,"" is very well done--informative, funny, and poignant in places. John Thaw speaks eloquently on how he got into acting in the first place, the character of Morse that comes through him, and the price of fame (always feeling he is being watched). He makes it clear that there was always an emphasis on keeping the character of Morse (slightly morose and wonderfully eccentric) at the center of each Morse episode.

It's that emphasis on character that deepens this effort at sleuthing the secrets of death--and life.

For example, a blackmailer is murdered, even though the reason for this drastic measure is not completely clear or convincing--- since the wife of the person being blackmailed already knows the relevant salacious details.  Additionally, Sergeant Lewis displays at least one behavior which was inconsistent with the development of his personality/character in the later episodes.  Lewis, always something of a moralistic Boy Scout at heart, commits an act of doubtful legality (without the slightest protest) by willingly searching offices without a warrant and without the permission of the occupants.

448700,5,6302287634,"Dear Inspector Endeavor Morse of the Thames Valley Police in Oxford England (the late John Thaw) is a good police officer. When he isn't dectecting, he's home listening to Wagner or Turandot on the phonograph and drinking whisky. On duty, he may often be found having a pint of dark bitter at a pub with Sgt. Lewis (Kevin Whately). Morse does have his problems with the opposite sex, however. He meets attractive women left and right, but they always seem to have a dark secret. Sooner or later, he is embroiled in their problems.
In THE DEAD OF JERICHO, Morse encounters the lovely Anne Stavely (Gemma Jones, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY) a fellow member of an Oxford community choir. One evening after choir rehearsal, Anne invites Morse back to her new flat in the recently gentrified Jericho section of Oxford. One thing leads to another, and soon Morse discovers Anne has troubling secrets she won't share with him.
The day of the choir concert, Anne does not show up. Morse drives to her flat only to discover Thames Valley Police SOCO (Scene of crime officers) at hand. Who killed the victim, or was it suicide? Who was the young man staying with Anne who kept a copy of ""Oedipus Rex"" beside his bed? And what about the nosy neighbor--did he see something he should tell the police? Morse soon steps into sticky ethical waters as he is no longer a disinterested bystander. His difficulties grow more complex by the hour as he discovers death, backmail, and other illicit activities in Jericho--all involving Anne.
This is an excellent DVD and a good recording of the original TV show. My DVD has a little documentary of the ""Making of Morse"" showing locations around Oxford. A definite plus for Anglophiles.",1030924800,19,1707,4.77027027027027

Synopsis:

Anne Stavely is a music teacher, (she proves the theory of nominative determinism), and sings in a local Choral Society as does our hero, Inspector Morse. Morse is attracted to Anne but unfortunately for Morse she is in love with her former employer. When Anne is found hanged in her kitchen, Morse is determined to discover the truth of why she committed suicide and what drove her to it.

Here it is , the first episode of a series that would captivate me to this very day. With a great actor in the leading role and being ably supported by the British institution that is Kevin Whately. Throw in some great British character actors like Patrick Troughton and Gemma Jones and with hindsight it is difficult to imagine the show failing.

I have to admit that this particular episode doesn't feature in my top ten all time favourite episodes. However, when the episode is put into context, i.e. the first episode of the first series and taking on a new format of a two hour show, then it can be seen as a fabulous episode that sets up Morse's character for future episodes. Thankfully, Morse's leather jacket and hat combination never resurfaced in future episodes.
The episode starts off like an episode of The Sweeney (the section about the raid on the garage at least) and one wonders if this intentional by the writer Anthony Minghella. Is it possible he was trying to wrong-foot the audience? Before that scene we have the incongruous Vivaldi music playing from Morse's car as he drives to the garage and then of course the cut scenes of the Choral Society. The audience must have wondered what kind of detective show they were watching. I love the incongruity of the typical police show scene with a raid on a crooked garage and the sound of Vivaldi and Parry. How many of the audience were waiting for John Thaw to jump out of the car and shout, 'You're nicked'?

There are two small problems I have with the episode. Firstly, is the Agatha Christie style gathering of the suspects at Anne Stavely's house. This scene just doesn't work in relation to the rest of the episode. Thankfully, there was no such scenes in future episodes that I can remember. Secondly, the blackmail letter received by Alan Richards. Whose letter did he receive? George Jackson sent a blackmail letter as did Ned Murdoch. Was this a mistake in the script or am I missing something.

A great cast with a solid performance from all concerned. The interaction between Morse and Lewis is excellent and sets us up nicely for forthcoming episodes.

Memorable Line - ""You're a clever sod but you don't say the right things to the right people."" Spoken by Strange to Morse.",1400630400,,2831,4.685483870967742

So beautiful.  Who knew that such suspenseful goings on happened behind those hallowed walls?  Add this to your collection.  Very enjoyable viewing.",1397779200,,314,5.2
7823621,5,6302287634,"As devoted a fan of Inspector Morse, played by John Thaw, as I was. I had never seen the first episode in series one. I lived the series, and I was so sad to see it end. I had read several of the books by Colin Dexter in the series, and, now, after all these years, I have seen the first.

John Thaw was an actor of high acclaim. He starred as the melancholy and romantic Inspector Morse. And, as we find out, he never used his first name. He found pleasure in ale, classical music and difficult crossword puzzles.  In this episode we meet Sergeant Lewis, played by Kevin Whately.  Morse uses his intellect and lust for truth to investigate death and murder in the English university town of Oxford. He loved women, and as the series proceeds we meet many of them, however, he was unable to find a permanent relationship.

This first episode, 'The Dead of Jericho' was first seen in January 1987.  Morse meets a young woman, Anne Stavely, played by a very young, Gemma Jones, at a classical chorale. Morse is taken with her, and they go out for drinks. He discovers as he sees her home, that she is involved with someone else. Hope makes plans, however, to pick her up for their big day when the chorale sings in public. He goes to pick her up, finds the door open but no one is home.  He later learns she has been found dead, hanging. This is not his case, but he hones in. After a bit, the Inspector in charge of the case is promoted to Superintendent, and Morse is put in charge.
Thus begins the famous Morse/Lewis partnership.

Morse suspects foul play and sets out to discover the truth. The esteemed, Anthony Minghella wrote the episode, and it was directed by Alastair Reid. This episode still holds up today. It is fun to see these actors playing in the prime of their lives. You can go home again, in a way.
