5904031,5,B00ECXJBX8,"VAMPIRA AND ME opens up a vast, largely unknown story of the astonishing Maila Nurmi, a pioneer of television and an icon of several intersecting cultural movements.  This is MUCH more than a fan expose (though Vampira enthusiasts will rejoice at the extremely rare footage director R. H. Greene has uncovered).  Greene's personal access to the elderly but still vivid and emotional Nurmi is remarkable, and the film is a soaring tribute to a woman who shattered just about every convention of her time.  Highly recommended!",1378252800,7,524,5.069767441860465
5904032,5,B00ECXJBX8,"A very moving film of a Hollywood icon, a woman who broke the stereotype and created her own life mold.",1503446400,,103,4.2
5904033,4,B00ECXJBX8,"It's an absolute crime that so little Vampira footage exists today. Director R.H. Greene did a good job of preserving the only remaining moments available. He also did a good job of padding this documentary with decent back-up visuals. Overall, I found this to be a great source of information about Vampira / Maila Nurmi. I just wish it would've covered a bit more of the court battle against Elvira, and I would've liked to hear Maila discuss her thoughts on Tim Burton's Ed Wood film. It's a shame that Maila's life story was so sad, but she left behind an iconic figure that'll last forever.",1502323200,,595,4.622641509433962

5904035,5,B00ECXJBX8,"I've always loved the image of Vampira, she was just so vampy and glamorous in every sense that I gasped the first time I saw a photo of her. Towards the end of the documentary, the narrator notes how most fans love the icon but fall in love with Maila Nurmi and that's definitely what happened with me. What an absolutely gorgeous human being who deserved so much more. I vaguely knew about her connection to James Dean, but their relationship was so touching it really made me appreciate the work they both accomplished. The way the information was presented was a bit all over the place at times, but being able to hear her speak and share her experiences was well worth the time!",1500854400,,683,4.472
5904036,5,B00ECXJBX8,"Before this documentary-esq film I really wasn't a fan of Vampira but after I have absolutely fallen in love with her.

This film really illustrates a completely different side to the character we all know. Definitely enjoyed every minute of this.",1499126400,,247,5.024390243902439
5904037,5,B00ECXJBX8,"I only came to know of Vampira through ""Plan 9."" I was aware of Vampira's lawsuit against Elvira, but didn't really know that much more about her. When I saw this movie available through Amazon Prime, I thought I'd give it a try. (Independent documentaries like this can be really hit and miss.)

The documentary itself was very nicely done, very professional -- I'm sure on a very limited budget. The subject matter was fascinating. And the lady herself -- marvelous! I'm so glad her thoughts were captured so well and sympathetically before she left us for that ""other planet.""

Are there other documentaries available from the same people? If so, I'd like to know. Thanks.",1498348800,2,675,4.810344827586207
5904038,5,B00ECXJBX8,"Seldom does any ONE person literally create an entire genre, singlehandedly.  This was the film contribution of Maila Nurmi, also known as TV's ""Vampira.""  Without her deathly white makeup, stellar figure, and outrageous, campy attitude, their wouldn't even be such a thing as Elvira, the Goth movement, Women's Lib, counter culture, or even the Addams Family movies.  SHE was the groundbreaker, SHE was the first, SHE was the best, SHE was the eternal icon.  In this loving and respectful tribute to Ms. Nurmi, her memory is once again reborn, as if from the grave.  RIP.",1496188800,,572,4.978947368421053
5904039,5,B00ECXJBX8,"First, the bad / sad news: Only about 2 minutes of footage of Maila Nurmi's VAMPIRA show are known to exist -although I did read an article a few years ago that stated that most of the full episodes were still in existence, held by a nameless ""owner"". Now, the good news: VAMPIRA AND ME is a loving, fascinating look at Maila Nurmi and her alter-ego, told -mostly- in her own words, in the flesh! Writer / Director R.H. Greene went to great lengths to present a tribute that isn't just some fawning, fanboy fiesta. He allows the tragedy and pain of Maila's life to emerge, filling in the blank spaces. From her first wearing of the VAMPIRA persona at a masquerade party, to her meteoric rise as the dark star of KABC-TV in Los Angeles, Ms. Nurmi was larger than life. Still, though she had her time w/ James Dean, dated Elvis, and ultimately fell from grace, spending many years in abject poverty, Maila comes off w/ dignity and poise. Of course, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is covered, as is her wondrous part in THE BEAT GENERATION! Also, her meeting up w/ punk / horror band THE MISFITS is discussed. However, for me at least, the best, most haunting part of the entire documentary is Maila's singing / reciting the song GENOCIDE UTOPIA w/ SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS. This impromptu performance gives me goosebumps, no matter how many times I hear it! The fact that Maila was 64 when she did it, says all we need to know about her blazing, undying spirit! Also, her other performance w/ SC called I'M DAMNED, plays during the end credits. Highly recommended...",1491177600,3,1553,4.56989247311828
5904040,5,B00ECXJBX8,"Thank you to R.H. Greene for sharing this personal and intimate documentary of and memorial to Vampira.
She is back on her home planet and the anxiety is gone.

Some invent and others copy and take the inventors money to their own bank.  Love the inventors.

It really was a misfortune that the recording technology was not around when she did her show and that it was only regional.  Damn the corporations and the copy cats.  I know Whispers is burning in hell where they belong.  At least that fact allows me to smile through the grief.",1490572800,,538,4.494845360824742

Definately worth viewing for the long lost footage.  Unsure why ""and me"" was added to title because specific relationship - or historical perspective of importance of alleged acquaintance/relationship - was never logically explained.  Nurmi was a marvelous comet would should gave had an ""and me"" looking out for her in the 1950's when she needed it most.",1478044800,,518,5.070588235294117

5904067,5,B00ECXJBX8,"Interesting and informative film about Vampira, Maila Nurmi. Probably an excellent example of being so well known as a character and of the actress indelibly identifying with it, that when the fame was over it was hard for her to do anything else. This was a journey into her life and career. Also, a bit about her friendship or kinship with James Dean. I found it to be very poignant and a little sad too. I'm glad she found friendship with filmmaker R.H. Greene and that she lived to see her Vampira character become a cult sensation.",1475193600,,536,4.536082474226804

My heart aches knowing she does not get the justice and recognition she so much deserves for paving the way. This documentary shows a cheeky, real side of horror host, Vampira and leaves you feeling warm and appreciative for everything this lady has done. A true pioneer of her time.

At times I thought the director was a bit self indulgent and interjected too much of himself into the story, but the approach also kept the story from becoming too dry and sterile.  I was impressed by the film's attention to detail and historical context. I appreciated the extent to which much the archival footage was painstakingly restored to nearly its original quality.

It's worth owning just to have the only known footage of Maila Nurmi on TV as the Vampira character but there's so much more here. The interviews with Ms. Nurmi are touching and left me with a much better understanding of the woman I was introduced to as a silent ""ghoul"" in Plan 9.

5904086,4,B00ECXJBX8,"This is a very well made documentary about Maila Nurmi who would be much more well known as Vampira. And make no mistake Maila takes full credit for developing the character that in many ways would become a cultural television icon. Though only shown in the Los Angeles and surrounding area it seemed everyone knew who Vampira was and would receive fan mail from around the world. She had a look and style about her that television had never seen before and would never forget.

But this documentary is so much more then just about Vampira. This is an in depth look at the life of Maila Nurmi and what an interesting life that was from ""cheesecake model"" to actress to TV Horror Show host. Of course what makes this documentary so interesting is the fact that the majority of the film has Maila herself talking about her life, loves and career. Even if you had never heard of Maila Nurmi or her character Vampira you just may find Nurmi's life story compelling to watch and listen to.

5904091,4,B00ECXJBX8,"R. H. Greene's affection for Maila Nurmi/Vampira is infectious.  It is true that Nurmi--a kind of counter-culture Auntie Mame--fascinates on her own.  The fascination intensifies when Nurmi's story is viewed through Greene's lens and spirit.  Greene has unearthed as much fifties footage of Vampira as possible, as well as clips from Nurmi's few film roles; his detective work is commendable.  Even more commendable is the way that Greene conducts the interview with the aging Nurmi, who tells her story with humility and sadness.  I am tempted to say that the filmmaker-subject relationship has a Harold and Maude quality but that's not quite it.

Documentaries about presidents and generals can be such a bore.  How nice to see one about someone who skated along on the underside of the ice.",1413417600,,793,5.10077519379845

The film is cautious to focus on Maila being a real person and Vampira being a character, which seemed to be an uncommon separation during her life.

5904110,5,B00ECXJBX8,This documentary was excellent...covered Maila's story so thoroughly and entertainingly....truly a woman ahead of her time in the industry!!! There would have been no Lilly Munster or Elvira if Maila hadn't paved the way.,1389052800,2,221,5.529411764705882
5904111,5,B00ECXJBX8,"Containing almost all known photos and salvageable footage of Vampire left in the world, this is the ultimate insiders look at the icon who's legacy lives on in such modern icons as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

5904112,4,B00ECXJBX8,"I think I first saw Vampira in her Plan 9 role...I was just a little too young, and on the wrong coast for her TV appearances, but as a horror buff, she's always been an iconic figure, and paved the way for the likes of John Zacherle (Zacherly), who was the cool ghoul for those of us growing up on the east coast. This was an enjoyable film, although it's sad that she, like the three stooges, was used up, and then tossed aside by the industry.",1387152000,,446,4.137931034482759
5904113,5,B00ECXJBX8,"THE BEST homage to  Vampira I have seen to date  there are others out there and they are good ones, but this was done as a project by a true fan who appreciated the lady behind the make up and took great pains to locate NEW footage and show specials where they had her on and you get to see her good comedic humor.  A much more intimate look into her life and trials and shows just how far ahead of her time she was for the dark and gothy genre.  But while it is sad in some spots  you still walk away wanting to watch it again.  Dear Mr. Greene  THANK YOU for this over-the-bar work of yours!  If you ever uncover more show footage and guest spot programs, I hope you will consider doing a supplement DVD.  But mainly  thanks from another Vamipra fan,  for the deep care, that went into this.

5904116,4,B00ECXJBX8,"getting past the directors narration that after a while starts sounding like a werner herzog docu, the viewer is treated to never before seen tv footage of maila nurmi doing guest appearances as vampira on many popular variety shows from the mid to late 50's. also there is an extensive amount of info given first hand by maila in some funny, dramatic and witty interviews.
  my only complaint is that her real desire was to be a televangelist (or at least a traveling evangelist) is not mentioned anywhere.
in ""vampira the movie"" maila talks on many occasions about this subject. her plan was to make enough money so she could realize her dream of becoming an evangelist (of sorts).",1382313600,,683,4.73109243697479
5904117,4,B00ECXJBX8,"There are roughly two other Vampira/Maila Nurmi documentaries (I have them both)and this one is definitely a labor of love and gives much more insight to who she was as a woman (I could have added much more to that aspect, but wasn't asked). Maila was a 'woman of truth' and she would have definitely wanted the details of her later life told. She did not sugar coat things. I appreciate the sympathetic tone of this film. There were but a handful of us who know those stories. The extraordinary 1966 audio tapes are total treasures, as that was a time in her life we know next to nothing about.

The archival footage is amazing and it's so great to know at least some were preserved. It shows sides of the character, Vampira, that we certainly never knew! It is unclear if we are seeing these clips in their entirety, however, but it is a joy to see ANYhting, as there is so little out there.

This is an absolute must for any Vampira fan.",1381363200,13,940,4.365714285714286
5904118,5,B00ECXJBX8,"My fear in buying this documentary was that it would be yet another amateurish and thoroughly crummy Ed Wood-related project that was packed with talking heads and little insight. What I watched last night, however, was entirely free of the trappings of Ed Wood World (with Ed confined, rightfully, to the margins of Maila's life). Instead, what I witnessed was one of the most intimate and penetrating documentary portraits of an individual that I have watched in quite some time.

Even if I had never had an interest in alt-cultural-pioneer Vampira - which I most certainly do - I think I would objectively say that this movie is a well made and artfully directed piece of work. The insightful narration provided by the director, a friend and confidante of the late Maila Nurmi, aka Vampira, provides the beating heart to this story and also helps us to get under the fragile and wounded skin of this most interesting of women. So many of the questions I had about her life (in particular, how she fared after the decline of her career) were answered too in this documentary - such was the tragedy though of her demise, that I am now thinking that perhaps I wish I didn't know those details after all. And yet, hearing her full story and learning about the tough circumstances she endured for so long made her so much more alive and real to me.

Perhaps the greatest thing this documentary does in the end though, is to rescue Vampira / Maila from the shadow of Plan 9. I love Ed Wood and that whole scene, but Maila was so much more startling and original than her ghoulish demeanor in that movie have ever seemingly suggested to so many over the years. Previous documentaries have captured some of her wit and sparky personality for sure - but this one in particular places her front and center as a complete human being: tough and funny, ambitious and bright, wounded and wary, defiant and dignified, creative and unforgettable.

Featuring previously unseen and lovingly restored footage of Vampira and lots of interesting extras, this is Vampira's / Maila's biography in motion. This documentary may make you want to scream about the sadness that must have invaded her life, but ultimately it will actually leave you amazed at the unbroken and unbowed soul of the lady who kept her wits and class about her to the bittersweet end.

RIP Maila / Vampira will live forever",1381363200,32,2375,4.715662650602409
5904119,5,B00ECXJBX8,"Whenever I find myself confronted by televisuals of Vampira and Maila Nurmi, I always find myself being seduced by Vampira but falling in love with Maila. And that is never more true than with VAMPIRA AND ME, the definitive documentary about Vampira and Maila Nurmi by R. H. Greene.

VAMPIRA AND ME is so much more than a valentine, so much more than a collection of anecdotes, history and rare film clips. It is Maila Nurmi's own story in her own words, a record of her essence, really, perhaps even a self-portrait where Greene may have held the brush but his hand was certainly guided by Maila.

Maila Nurmi's struggles, pain and betrayals are laid bare but are balanced by her uniqueness, regalness, intelligence and passions. Unless one were fortunate enough to have been part of her world, this documentary may be as close one can get to understanding such an arresting character and wonderful woman. Even at her advanced age her eyes are uncannily young and bright.

This DVD is more than a Halloween purchase. It is more than a chronicle of Vampira's cultural impact. It is a bittersweet celebration of someone who deserved more than she received as far as comforts are concerned, but whose experiences are a prince's palace of riches.

And of course there is an abundance of rare audio, photos and video, the icing on the cake being footage (unseen for almost sixty years) of Vampira's sketch appearance on THE GEORGE GOBEL SHOW. Watching the sequence one cannot help but feel one is watching the first video incarnation of Morticia Addams.

Take Vampira home with you and let Maila Nurmi into your heart.

Viva Vampira!",1381276800,15,1629,4.8
5904120,5,B00ECXJBX8,"I discovered VAMPIRA AND ME attending a film festival and came away thoroughly impressed by the filmmaker's accomplishments, so I'm very pleased to see it's getting a DVD release.  Growing up in the Bay Area in the 70s, I fondly remember tuning in weekly to the local affiliate's ""monster movies"" show, Creature Features on KTVU.  Remember Bob Wilkins, people?  However, I had no idea of the cultural elements at play in the prior decades, that paved the way for the show I grew up loving.  With editorial dexterity, R. H. Greene cast his eye on the media and cultural landscape of the 50s (and beyond) and crafts a fascinating filmic essay - one that gave me a fresh and welcome new perspective on the America that Hollywood was a part of post-World War II.  The filmmaker delivers his larger historical explorations inside a very personal story of a friendship that blossomed unexpectedly with the person at the center of this film.  Detailing her impressive accomplishments as well as some of the unfortunate low points in her life, this fuller telling of Maila Nurmi's life - largely in her own words - truly elevates the film above the ordinary, dry, entertainment channel biographies one runs across on the tube.  There are a lot of interesting rarities, and a wealth of carefully chosen and illuminating archival films. The filmmaker's affection for his subject is felt throughout, and he has delivered a thoughtful and moving tribute to a pioneering entertainer whose work is, to this day, still reverberating throughout the culture.  A unique documentary!",1381190400,2,1564,4.9655172413793105
5904121,4,B00ECXJBX8,"The best films present not one well-constructed message but many, providing the audience with endless avenues of meaning and discussion. VAMPIRA AND ME offers just that. As a young woman, Maila Nurmi's journey felt extremely poignant to me. Few works of film or television offer such a relevant picture of the professional and personal struggles women must endure, particularly those in the entertainment industry. The documentary also acts as a fascinating gateway into Goth culture, one this reviewer was hitherto only superficially aware of. We see how instrumental Ms. Nurmi was in shaping so much of the Gothic culture we've come to take for granted. And not only that, but Ms. Nurmi sheds many of our preconceived notions of Hollywood's Golden Age and reveals the giants of that era for what they really were. VAMPIRA AND ME is an engaging sociological and historical study as well as a deeply personal exploration into how a woman like Ms. Nurmi could've suffered so greatly.",1378512000,5,982,5.067901234567901

8604070,5,B00ECXJBX8,"A unique biographical documentary of Maila Nurmi (aka Vampira), who burst upon the Hollywood television scene in the early 1950s, saw her career completely evaporate within just a few years, and spent the rest of her life trying to recapture her ""one minute"" of fame.  Considering the paucity of archival material, this documentary does an outstanding job of telling Nurmi's story and making you forget entirely that only a few minutes of original Vampira footage yet survives from the 1950s.  This is a sad story of a would-be star who was, for the most part, chewed up and spit out of the Hollywood meat-grinder with not much to show for it, aside from a nostalgic and cultish goth legacy.  Contains a rare and extended interview with Nurmi, but sort of glosses over many details in favor of others.  Essential viewing for retro horror fans.",1518480000,,843,4.833333333333333

Most of the work done by young sexy Vampira was never recorded so we don't get to see that. Instead we get to see a lot of the 90 year old woman who used to be Vampira.
