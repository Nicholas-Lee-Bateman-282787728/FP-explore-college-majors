4106540,4,B003BJO8M8,It's a shame that A&E cancelled any future episodes of this drama series. I personally thought it was very well done and held your attention through the entire hour. The cast was great and this series was based on true facts. The broad spectrum of characters that were addicted to drugs was so interesting. Made you realize that drug addiction is no respecter of persons. I recommend this two season series hightly.,1300147200,6,415,4.777777777777778

4106542,5,B003BJO8M8,It is such a shame that this series was canceled.  Some of the best acting and realistic story lines ever.,1277683200,7,106,4.3
4106543,2,B003BJO8M8,"BACK WHEN IT first aired on cable, A&E - which still translates to Arts and Entertainment - used to air import series, such as ""The Lovejoy Mysteries,"" based on the books by Jonathan Gash and starring a young Ian McShane.

The art is gone: A&E is a wasteland of reality shows: ""Hoarders,"" ""Dog, The Bounty Hunter,"" ""Intervention"" and the latest chronicles of Kristie I'll-Exploit-Anything-For-A-Buck Allie where the entertainment factor is, at best, questionable. These programs are geared towards the voyeuristic and disturbed because nothing's more engaging than actual violence, the addicted and the mentally challenged.

Among A&E's short-lived drama category are two series with ""edgy"" leading roles: ""The Beast,"" starring the late Patrick Swayze, and ""The Cleaner,"" starring Benjamin Bratt. Problem is, ""edgy"" translates to ""unlikable"" meaning un-watchable. You can't doubt the charisma of actors such as Swayze and Bratt or the loyalty of their fans. But you can torture said-fans into viewing misery-in-action under the guise of extreme reality-based entertainment.

""The Cleaner,"" based on the exploits of William Boyd, is about a former drug addict who, after losing it all and spending time in prison, believes he's received a calling from God to detox other addicts by any means possible at the expense of the law, his family and business. There's nothing noble about him; he kidnaps his prey and, with his team, tortures them into submission because contracts with God allow this kind of behavior.

""The Final Season,"" A.K.A. ""The Second Season,"" provides more of the same in brilliant color and excellent sound. There are 13 episodes on four discs. Extras also include cast and crew commentaries on a few episodes, deleted scenes, a gag reel and promos.

Whoopi Goldberg co-stars as Banks' recovery sponsor. Mariette Hartley, Gary Cole, Joe Don Baker, Shirley Jones and Christine Lahti are some of the guest stars. Comedian and actor Richard Lewis appears as a heroin addict in the final episode, ""Trick Candles,"" where Bratt's character reconciles with ... well, that would be a spoiler. Still, you've got to care enough to watch and that's not recommended.

Is it time A&E considered changing its name? -Agent Meerkat",1275436800,7,2233,5.276056338028169
