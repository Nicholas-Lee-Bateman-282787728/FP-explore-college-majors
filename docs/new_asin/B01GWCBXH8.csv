8764110,5,B01GWCBXH8,"I saw this in the theatre as a child in the 70s, still LOVE IT today as an adult. This movie inspired me to read the books. Ive remained a Tolkien fan my ever since.  True lovers of Middle Earth and the books will cherish this. Those who only enjoy big budget Tolkien motion pics may be disappointed.
This movie has all the MAGIC of the book, but condensed.
WELL CRAFTED animation for its time. The story is followed with INTEGRITY.
The only significant creative license taken is the pronunciation of Saruman (frequently called Aruman), but clearly this was done with the intention of avoiding possible confusion for the young. Saruman/Sauron.
Unfortunately, its comprised of mostly the first two books and doesnt take you through to the end of the trilogy. SATISFYING, nonetheless.
A REAL GEM!!",1522022400,,795,4.845588235294118
