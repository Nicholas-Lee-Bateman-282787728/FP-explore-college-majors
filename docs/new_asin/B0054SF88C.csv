8457048,5,B0054SF88C,"Regarded with great affection by children of a certain age, the classic 80's/90's British television programme T-BAG has now been released on DVD, after years of tireless campaigning by the fans who'd never let it die.  One of the most imaginative series of it's time, T-BAG ran for nine seasons, each one a complete adventure in itself.  The basic premise was simple: a little girl would have to collect a certain series of magical objects in an effort to stop power-mad witch T-Bag from destroying the world.

The original series of T-BAG was commissioned in 1985 as an educational programme to help children to learn to read (this educational bent was soon forgotten in later series, which were very much for entertainment value!).  Debbie, played by Jennie Stallwood, is on her way home from school when she happens by an old Curiosity Shop.  Stepping inside, she spies a boardgame entitled ""Wonders in Letterland"", which magically flips open to reveal a tiny gardener (Jim Norton), who explains to Debbie about the current strife in Letterland.  T-Bag (Elizabeth Estensen), the inhabitant of the game's T-square, has banished the letters from the enchanted legend chest, and outlawed reading.  By ""thinking small"", Debbie launches into the game to collect the missing letters and complete the legend.  Along the way, she's helped by a series of characters (mostly played by Norton), but also hindered by T-Bag and her pint-sized caddy T-Shirt (John Hasler).

Flute-grass, Balthazar the Bouncer, Indiana Inkspot, Skipper McKipper, Seraphina the Sea Sprite, Polar Pete...they're all here!

Filmed on a shoestring budget, the charm of T-BAG comes a lot from it's obvious cardboard sets and dodgy special effects.  Later series had bigger budgets from which to work from, and by the final years the show ran like a well-oiled machine.  But the performances are excellent - for many, the definitive T-Bag remains Elizabeth Estensen and her commanding yet comical presence.  Jennie Stallwood's Debbie was one of T-Bag's most formidable, feisty little enemies and would return in two more series.  John Hasler literally grew up in front of the camera, starring in all nine series and eventually taking T-Shirt into the difficult teenage years.

I have very fond memories of watching T-BAG as a child.  It was most often screened during school holidays here in Australia, and I used to have to arrange the rest of my holiday actitivies around the show!  I loved it so much - and still do.  To have the show on DVD is an absolute dream come true.  This DVD includes all 10 episodes from the first series (WONDERS IN LETTERLAND, re-titled TROUBLE WITH T-BAG for copyright reasons), plus special audio commentaries also available on select episodes with Elizabeth Estensen, Jennie Stallwood, John Hasler and Jim Norton.",1316995200,3,2813,5.102620087336245
