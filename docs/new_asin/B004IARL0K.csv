All their facts and figures are just as bad as watching a 24/7 news channel. Basically you're supposed to believe what they say simply because they say it.

...I sir refuse to believe you just because you say its true. Its the whole space kettle theory all over again.",1340755200,,432,4.333333333333333
8430544,5,B004IARL0K,"Whether you are someone who is interested in learning more about the process of mediumship and its application in historical research, or simply interested in all things paranormal, this DVD is for you. Fear not,  for this is not your run-of-the-mill, over-produced,  look-good-on-tv, unresearched and unscientific paraceleb ghosthunting package.

Bonnie Vent is one of the most genuine mediums I have had the opportunity to observe.  She works tirelessly at providing tangible proof of Life After Death.

And Bonnie is a true ""Spirit Advocate"" able to bridge the dimensions and provide a voice for the spirit people on the other side of the veil;  those who are seeking to complete unfinished projects, or to send a message to loved ones and to those on this plane of existence.

The process of delivering these messages, at times, requires some historical research to provide proof of the accuracy of the message, as well as action items to assist the spirit person in finishing their projects here with us. These are just to name a few of the more fascinating aspects of this process.

This DVD provides two interesting segments.

The first segment is dedicated to Yankee Jim Robinson and the apparent reasons why his spirit has been present at the Whaley House in Old Town San Diego. In this particular instance Bonnie Vent works from Yankee Jim's own account about his death,  using the process of researching historical records to validate the information, and to determine what actually transpired with the events leading up to his death; and where the historic record may be inaccurate about the details of his passing. There are numerous surprising details. This seems to be an inter-twining story of Yankee Jim and Thomas Whaley and current events, which seem to be intent on keeping the true facts of what transpired at that time hidden from us. All that may be causing Yankee Jim's energy to remain in place at the Whaley House.

The other segment is dedicated to the haunted Cosmopolitan Hotel and shows channeled communication via Bonnie with the spirit people residing there. In addition the hotel staff's personal accounts of their experiences with the energies at the hotel are documented and are also quite interesting. The interviews are facilitated by John Streiff.  The switching of the channels of communication  via Bonnie, provided some additional validation for the historical record of Old Town San Diego as given by some known and lesser known, as well as prominent personalities. Very interesting and is well worth watching.",1326412800,,2552,5.076555023923445

She was a joke - reading off prompt cards throughout the show, and finally doing a ""And-you-were-there"" conversation with the (""quote"") dead - - - which was SO PHONEY that I finally had to shut the whole stupid movie off !  It was HORRIBLE !  The interviews with hotel employees was SO BAD, that it looked like the editing was done by a child.  Just ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC !  I was hoping for a GOOD solid DVD about probably THE MOST HAUNTED HOUSE IN AMERICA:  The Whaley House, in Old Town, located in San Diego, California.  Instead, I watch a trashy and C-grade blunder of what could have been an AWESOME DVD !
