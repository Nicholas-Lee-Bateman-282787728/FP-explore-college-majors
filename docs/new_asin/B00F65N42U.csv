They sound like foreigners who just got off the boat and are trying to pronounce english words according to french rules.  It is in turn irritating, laughable, and stupid.  Why should these well meaning folk have put so much effort into getting so much right, costumes, decor, choreography, lighting by candlelight, etc. and have not seemed to care if they were pronouncing the english words right?  After all, they are right across the channel from England, and could have sent a boat over to get someone, anyone, to help them get it right.  If William Christie spent most of his laudable career doing many of the unknown french baroque operas in a similar fashion, and had singers who could not properly pronounce french, he would have had a very short career indeed.  And if the french speakers are so sensitive about their own language, should they not have thought that we english speakers would not be so, too, about ours?  I have been so put off by so very many operas being put onto dvd, with eurotrash and dumb director's far-fetched concepts, and time after time have read reviews where the reviewers ended by saying, it's nice to listen to, just turn off the picture; in which case, putting on a cd and imagining your own scenario would have been just as worthy.  Here, we have the opposite: it's very nice to see, and the singing per se and dancing are very fine, but you might as well put on a cd to hear it intelligibly.  I put the english subtitles on and the disparity between what the text was and the sounds they were making, well....So be forewarned, if you can put up with amateurish values in a crucial way, you might enjoy this.  I do not feel I shall watch it again, EVER!",1392768000,7,1873,4.544642857142857
8612599,4,B00F65N42U,"This is in many ways a  very beautiful production. It is the only existing DVD of this first Baroque opera by John Blow, about Venus and her obsession with Adonis who is killed by a boar while hunting and it is admirable to have fine singing and baroque dance.

Unfortunately, there are severe defects that should have been corrected in a production of this level. For the first baroque opera in the  English language, it would not have been so difficult to bring in a  diction coach for this cast. Instead, the English is at times incomprehensible and sounds very strange at best. The staging could have been much more interwoven with the meaning of the words. In this production, no one looks at each other. Everything is facing out to stage front, so most of the time the characters do not speak to each other. That being said the dancing and singing are at a fine level and the set, made up of candles and trees create an atmosphere. Venus is beautiful and sings well. Cupid, the boy soprano sings well and is beautiful but no one coached his English and his""acting"" is flat and not the playful cupid of Blow's score. Perhaps the director's vision was to have cupid as a mannequin for some strange reason. Blow's score portrays him as comic the diversion.

The choreography  was  very beautiful as is the singing. The use of the doves with the muses is outstanding and the recorder players as part of the ensemble also works very well.",1391299200,11,1439,4.554263565891473
