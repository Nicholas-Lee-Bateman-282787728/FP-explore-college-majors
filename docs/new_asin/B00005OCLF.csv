1640999,3,B00005OCLF,"This is a ""who done it"". It has nothing to do with the synopsis. There is no psychiatrist, there are no students and there are no vignettes about sexual deviants.

Its surprisingly good for a Franco movie but its also from very early in his career (way before he started losing all sensibility). Gothic noir with murder, ghost stories, great setting and pretty good acting for 1962. Although, there are a couple of quick boobie shots (if you watch real close), the erotica count is nil.

If you want to see a gothic noir from 1962, or want some different Franco for your collection, this is a very good movie (very good). If you read the synopsis, you'll think it sucked. :)",1373760000,19,674,4.516393442622951
1641000,5,B00005OCLF,"So many sexy woman always manage to walk alone at night along sinister streets and alleyways when a mad rapist/killer is on the loose! They're just asking for it...and Franco films it all with stylish camera angles among gothic German locations!
Great little horror mystery with a tight script and fine acting. Is the ghost of the sadistic Baron Von Klaus really reponsible for the gruesome killings or is it someone more human? The killer appears to have stepped out of Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, only Franco's film was made years earlier!
The winter location shooting adds a nice touch, there's a rough nudi torture/murder scene and it all manages to come off as a stylistic art film. An absolute must-have for Jess Franco fans and lovers of b&w Euro horror of the 1950's-60's.
Highly recommended!",1208649600,11,801,4.854014598540146
1641001,5,B00005OCLF,Howard Vernon stars in this classic Jess Franco film about a man who inherits his family's sadistic habits. This disc contains the often missing dungeon/torture sequence that is a real eye opener. The widescreen transfer is perfect and this is in french with english subtitles. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Franco fans and horror fans in general.,1011484800,4,340,5.2

7948770,3,B00005OCLF,"Jess Franco's ""The Sadistic Baron Von Klaus"" (1962) provides a viewing experience that, I felt, displayed the (then) young director at his BEST in terms of cinematography, but also presaged the tendency that most of his films exhibit: to somehow manage to suck the energy out of stories and imagery that should be viscerally exciting and render it bland... his WORST directorial trait!

The positive aspects of this film include: truly stunning B&W photography with great noir-ish lighting and artful composition of scenes - creating a genuinely eerie atmosphere.  The musical accompaniment is also striking - providing a blend of avante-garde jazz riffs and brooding classically inspired themes, as required.

The negative elements are that, despite all the wonderful Gothic ambiance and potentially transgressive story-line, the film actually generates little excitement nor empathy for the proceedings & characters involved.

Looking at the 'Sadistic Baron..."" within the context of Franco's career it may be acknowledged that this was a pivotal film for him and (perhaps) European horror cinema, and, as such, certainly deserves viewing by aficionados of the genre & Director... however fans of Franco's later, more 'sexually transgressive' offerings, will likely find this a rather dull watch.

There is a lot of 'talking' in this film about 'ghastly and torturous' events, but very little of such actions are actually shown. Pretty much all of the 'nasty' doings are either alluded to, off screen, and/or are so 'artfully' bathed in shadow that it's difficult to make out what's happening. The 'infamous' torture scene is notable ONLY for its' historic precedence as a 'first of its' kind'- what might have seemed shocking to audiences in the early '60's would barely raise an eyebrow today.  There is also very little nudity in this film - the aforementioned torture sequence is the only scene where any naked female flesh is (briefly) exposed.

Shortly after producing 'The Sadistic Baron Von Klaus' Franco hit upon the formula that was to secure his place in the hearts of (s)exploitation fans - adding lots of naked women to the mix - the key ingredient that makes sitting through his otherwise generally meandering & un-exciting films 'enjoyable'.

Despite its' titillating title, ""The Sadistic Baron..."" delivers few thrills and would largely be of interest, for more esoteric reasons I'd imagine, to rabid fans of Franco and/or Euro-Horror.  Unless you count yourself amongst such, I'd rate this one as more of a 'renter' than a 'keeper'.

Technically speaking - the letter-box widescreen DVD transfer from Redemption is exquisite - the only 'extra' (on the regular DVD version) is the original trailer for the film.",1434844800,6,2729,5.28175519630485
7948771,4,B00005OCLF,"I decided to try this film since I enjoy the Awful Dr. Orlof a lot, and after taking it in, this film isn't bad at all. I really enjoy the black and white cinematography as it gives the film a good atmospheric feel to it, and yes it can be slow at times. Its not quite up to the level of Dr. Orlof but it's still a good little mystery. There is one really shocking moment at the end which was the real payoff. Franco was *groundbreaking* for his time.
The blu ray from Redemption is a good presentation, the picture quality looks mighty good. Black levels are fine, good contrast. The audio is excellent. The movie is in French with no English audio, but does have English subtitles.. Not much in the way of extras but at least its available on bluray for legions of Franco fans.",1432944000,3,779,4.27027027027027
7948772,5,B00005OCLF,"Forget the older reviews; mine is for the fresh 2015 DVD and Blu-ray remaster of this classic film, as only the mind of Director Jess Franco could present! I haven't had the pleasure of seeing how good the Blu-ray must look, but based on the DVD from which I had the chance to watch several scenes, I've already ordered two of the Blu-ray copies!

From the title, you might imagine ""The Sadistic Baron Von Klaus"" to be a macabre evil film, but it's actually a decent murder mystery with the ""classic"" dungeon scene that most American audiences never got to watch when it was originally released.

It was also a bonus to learn that Kino International is handling the 2015 DVD and Blu-ray release of this title!",1431907200,,709,4.574803149606299
7948773,3,B00005OCLF,"The long, varied filmography of Jess Franco is littered with far more perils than treasures (especially as you progress through his life), and ""The Sadistic Baron Von Klaus"" is typically referred to as a lemon that pales in comparison to his more famous ""The Awful Dr. Orloff"" and the more artistic ""The Diabolical Dr. Z"". Upon first glance, the turgid pace and well-worn techniques used in those movies would seem to confirm this; however, this one has more to it than meets the eye.

The movie may not be great, but I found Franco's various eccentricities kept this one interesting. For most of the movie, Franco maintains his poker-face and let's the story unfold like a creaky murder mystery, only allowing his glare to falter when he reveals the murdered an hour before the movie is over! Couple this with an ending full of jazz, sadomasochistic tendencies and bondage and you've got a nice little hoary flick here! It may not be great, but it's classic Franco.",1410048000,,966,4.7844311377245505
7948774,3,B00005OCLF,This is not a movie I would watch in the middle of the night unless you wanted to fall asleep reading subtitles.  Most moves have the disclaimer of subtitles on it but this one did not. It did not also list that it was from the early 60's.  If you are looking for a black and while subtile movie this might be good for you but if not then move on and find something else to watch.,1387843200,2,380,3.9220779220779223
7948775,4,B00005OCLF,"Ok, maybe there's a bit of overbearingly annoying piano accompaniment here and there, but overall a good film. If it'd used a solo viola instead, this film could have been legendary...Oh well. But yes, some confused Amazon intern apparently got this synopsis mixed up with a whole different film. Either way, I'd recommend it. A subtly gothic murder mystery.",1384732800,,358,5.084745762711864
