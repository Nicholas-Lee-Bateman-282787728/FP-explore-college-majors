7013519,4,B00TOTZ1GQ,"Here, you have the BEST feel-good, MAINSTREAM, Hollywood, Drag Queen Movie YET made, in my opinion.  You have our Trans-Trinity of Swayze, Snipes, & Leguizamo - BIG, macho, POPULAR Names, at that time.  A supporting cast, that includes the GREAT Stockard Channing & a cameo by Robin Williams.  Heck, Steven Spielberg's Production Company powered its creation.  For its subject matter, at that time, it performed pretty well at the Box Office.

So WHY is there NO proper U.S. Blu-ray Release?  This Italian Import was better than nothing, but you have to always have to go into the menus to change the language back to English.  Also, this Blu-ray is more BARE-BONES compared to the U.S. DVD release, which had Deleted Scenes, at least.

The MOVIE itself is WONDERFUL, though, & I am GLAD to own the HD version of it, finally.  :-)",1459296000,6,830,4.788732394366197

8702400,4,B00TOTZ1GQ,"The mastering of this Blu Ray is questionable.  For the price, I may suggest waiting for a US release if you want the true Blu Ray experience -- especially when you can get it for $6.99 streaming HD on Amazon.  It is otherwise fine. Again, you have to select English 2.0 from the title menu.  Does not include DVD + Digital HD like the title originally stated when I bought it.",1516665600,,377,4.28169014084507
8702401,5,B00TOTZ1GQ,Aha by far one of the funniest lgbt films Ive seen. This is my second favorite film with John liguzamo he plays a hilarious drag queen. Probably the only time I liked snipes in a movie as well. This is a classic and a must own or watch movie.,1515801600,,242,3.9591836734693877

8702405,1,B00TOTZ1GQ,"Really quiet terrible!
I don't know of any drag queens that wear full drag while driving across the county in broad daylight.
The characters are not likeable and the storyline is full of stereotypes and does not make sense.
Very poor rip-off of the superior Australian film ""Pricilla, queen of the desert"".
You have been warned.",1493769600,,328,4.875

8702408,5,B00TOTZ1GQ,"To Wong Foo"" is still a romp decades later.  Who knew Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo and Wesley Snipes were such hot chicks? The retro fashions are a scream, and I was finally glad to get rid of the horrible image of Stockard Channing (in her role of the battered wife, Carol Ann) as the obviously-way-too-old-to-play-a-high-school-student Rizzo in ""Grease""!!! She certainly aged well, and Julie Newmar is as statuesque as ever.  This movie is just plain fun through and through.  Drag queens are anything but a drag.",1474502400,,517,4.988372093023256
