8509206,5,B0073GZWSO,"We have been Johnny Weir fans for a number of years, but hadn't seen this. It was an interesting trip back in time to see the complicated life of an athlete--especially an unabashedly gay one. Enjoyed it immensely. Hope he'll be doing commentary on the Kentucky Derby this year.",1426032000,3,278,4.6938775510204085

8509209,5,B0073GZWSO,Intriguing from start to finish. The dedication and enthusiasm this young man displays for his sport LEAPS off of the screen capturing viewer attention. You couldn't  watch this DVD and NOT be inspired. Wonderful humor injected throughout. An essential addition for every DVD Library.,1345680000,5,284,5.454545454545454
