8291813,5,B001D5YGQ0,"This video shows the history behind famous Christmas Carols. Each segment lasts less than 5 minutes. It's great to watch one each day as we prepare for Christmas.
The songs are not really played but only explained so in order to complete the video segment I finish by playing the song and we all sing it together!
This video is for everyone but little children might find it difficult to understand. Kids 8 and above and adults will enjoy it.",1291161600,4,442,4.5375
