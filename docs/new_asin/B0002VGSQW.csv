8033435,4,B0002VGSQW,"This little half-hour video is like an appetizer or teaser, introducing the viewer into the sardonic social-commentary of Mark Twain--a master observer and fearless ""whistle-blower"" on human nature in all its varieties.",1381708800,,219,5.875
8033436,3,B0002VGSQW,"I have this on VHS and was somewhat surprised to find it on DVD for the price. The running time is just over a half hour and there are no extras listed. Most of the film was shot in South Royalton, Vermont back in the early '80's and some of the stores kept their Hadleyburg logos into the new century. I used to have a summer home six miles away, but if you didn't, the nostalgia is not worth twenty bucks. I'll keep my VHS tape (if I can find it.)",1205280000,4,449,3.9450549450549453
8033437,3,B0002VGSQW,"This TV production from the 1980s is a decent translation of Twain's classic story to the small screen.  Robert Preston is always a joy to watch, and Fred Gwynne is good in his role as the minister.  This was one of a number of American Short Stories filmed for a PBS series, and its small budget does show -- the production and technical values are not impressive.  But content trumps in this case, and the power of the story takes you through the bumps.  The show has NOT been remastered for DVD, so the print has dirt and is not as sharp as it would be if it had been mastered from the negative.  The show (like all of the shows in this series) is only about 40 minutes, so at this price, it's a complete rip-off.  The video distributor should have put 4 or 5 stories on a disk, and then it would be worth buying at this price.  So rent it from NetFlix -- the cost of this DVD will pay for a month's subscription, and you'll be able to rent 10 or 12 of these and get your money's worth.",1146441600,12,989,4.0932642487046635
