533788,5,6302969271,This movie is perfect! Laurence Olivier is the only actor who has mastered Shakespeare to perfection! He truly is Richard III in this awesome movie. The only thing I am disappointed with is why this great movie is not on DVD yet! Hey people at the DVD company get off your bottoms and make this a DVD!!! And don't make it a sloppy one either! Make it as good as the movie!,1065139200,3,372,4.180555555555555
533789,5,6302969271,"A masterpiece! This contains most of it's actors finest performances of their career. Ralph Richardson, is far from his usual cuddly, highly comical performance (which is a little bit too mean on a fine very capable actor), we really get a sense of what Ralph must have been like at Shakespeare. John gielgud also delivers a fine performance, it is one of his best for this period in his career although i felt he was much better in his later years. I think the thorn in the film is undoubtedly the performance from Claire Bloom, I found her unconvincing as the seduced Lady Anne. Olivier's direction and tweaking was lthough not as original as Mckellen's Richard, was nevertheless inspired!
Well i have left the best till last and that was Olivier's performance itself, The man is a genius, the very way he coaxes you in is magic, it feels like he is takng your hand and making you a part of his conspiracy. It feels like he is right there with you sniggering. It is hard to believe that the man is 50 years behind you. You are on his side right the way through the film, it is a rare experiance to b so truly enraptured, in love with such a villain. His Death scene is history making, it is so tragic, you feel so sorry for him which is certainly not what you are suppose to feel for a man who has supposedly killed his brother and 2 nephews and has basically murdered his way to the top, but nevertheless Olivier has once again put a new perspective on the bard's work.",1020556800,13,1472,4.375912408759124
533790,4,6302969271,"Ah, but is it really HIS kingdom, this stolen crown of England? Shakespeare's ultimate justification of the Tudor claim to the throne, ""Richard III"" is one of the orginal villains you just love to hate.  Laurence Olivier struts his humpbacked stuff as the murderous Richard, Duke of Glouchester, plotting to get the crown for himself, even if it means killing off just about everyone related to him to do it, including the two little princes in the Tower. Olivier is joined in this movie by two old cronies, John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, and together the trio show us Yanks what British theatre was like at its best.  Watch and learn.",997315200,8,639,4.747747747747748
533791,5,6302969271,"Laurence Olivier does a FANTASTIC job of being so fantastically and deliciously evil in a wonderful production of this Shakespeare classic.  This is NOT meant to be historically accurate, but merely a telling of the play as it was written.  Olivier stays very true to the script although he adds some lines from Shakespeare's earlier plays to help round out the evil, plotting of Richard.  Necessary since the film audience wouldn't be as familiar with Shakespeare's historical plays.  It actually works really well and Olivier carries an unusual ""hero"" movie as the focus is on someone who's supposed to be despicable.  Olivier makes Richard so likably evil though, that you just end up cheering for him.  McKellan's version is good, but he just doesn't have the charisma of Olivier.  Go with this one first.",993081600,6,809,4.992537313432836
533792,5,6302969271,"Only two of Orson Welles' Shakespeare films rival ""Richard III"" for the title of greatest Shakespeare movie ever made. That said, Olivier's film may contain the most sheerly enjoyable performance any actor gave on film.  His Duke of Gloucester is the definitive performance. Elia Kazan once said Olivier had a certain girlish quality, and that quality is used in the film: His Richard is seductive--a prancing, charming monster whose voice sounds like ""honey mixed with razor blades."" But one look into his black eyes, framed by false hawk nose, violently angled eyebrows and fright pageboy wig, will tell you that he's also stone-cold pure evil. Richard enacts all our homicidal, plotting fantasies as he cheerfully knocks off all his stuffy relatives and rivals.
  Olivier emphasizes the black comedy and wittiness of Shakespeare's play, which he cut and refashioned into a star vehicle for himself. Though Sirs Gielgud, Richardson and Hardwicke co-star, they don't make much of an impression. (Blame that on Shakespeare too) Interestingly, Olivier later regretted not having cast Orson Welles as Buckingham.
  You experience two major innovations concerning the filming of Shakespeare: the first is Olivier's old custom of using extremely stylized, artificial sets, thereby making Shakespeare's stylized, artificial verse fit in with the settings. The second is the source of Olivier's triumph: he delivers his soliloquys directly to the camera. This daring move destroys the fourth wall and takes true advantage of what the movies offer. He becomes our friend and confidante and we become complicit in his mounting evil.  The production values are top-notch: we get deliriously vibrant technicolour, William Walton's pompous, irresistible music of pageantry, and the book-of-hours sets. And through those sets Olivier's camera subtly glides and skulks like the snake Richard himself is. Olivier is still an underrated director, and his grasp of the frame's spatial properties is excellent: he knew how to move the camera into and out of the frame for maximum impact. For an example, look at the moment Richard finally becomes King, and his satanic powers become unbottled: He slides down the bell rope to greet his minions, and expecting to shake his hand they approach, only to fall on their knees when  Richard silently demands they kiss it. As they sink downward, the camera flees backward until the awful composition is complete, with half a dozen men in black on their knees as Richard presides all in the center of the frame: on twisted and bent legs as the bells announce the triumph of evil.",988502400,54,2603,5.227817745803358
533793,5,6302969271,"Shakespeare's Richard is a villian of a most terrifying persuasion: An intelligent man of extreme privilege and rank who also routinely manipulates and murders friends and relatives for his own political gain. Olivier portrays the fiend with his trademark excellence.
Olivier's skills are in full glory as he becomes the unctious Duke of Gloucester; During the soliloquies, He shares his depraved and bitter complots with the viewer by speaking directly to the camera. It creates the effect that Richard is sharing his secrets with you in confidence, and allows Olivier to give you a ""private"" showing of his incredible depth in expression and physical gesture, and his astounding richness in vocal characterization. His Richard is also paradoxical, and his portrayal at times approaches farce. He paints the picture of a pampered, prating, and downright prissy Gloucester, but who also has a heart of dark hate and nerves of steel.
The amazing fact is that Olivier's Richard is actually likeable. The text calls for characters in the play to find Gloucester's charm and confidence so overwhelming that he wins their loyalty, and Olivier plays this part effectively. Part of this Richard's charm is a brash sissiness that cloaks his vile treachery. But his manner flatters the viewer as well. He seems at times to be almost winking at the audience, mocking his prey before us as he uses them. The fact that Richard can successfully woo even the audience makes me feel a palpable element of parody in the film, which gives it a sense of depth I really enjoy.
Enjoyable also is the work of the supporting cast: Sir Ralph Richardson as a wry but reasonable Buckingham, Sir John Gielgud as a hapless Clarence, unknowingly sent to execution by his evil brother Richard, Claire Bloom as the pathetic Lady Anne, hostage to Richard's lying heart. I will mention however, The actor who played Lord Hastings was woefully inadequate. His and a few other minor parts were portrayed with exceeding dullness and detracted from the overall.
But on the whole, I would put this in the highest class of Shakepearean rendition, with Olivier's vision as director and performance as actor as the two chief reasons.",982800000,4,2193,5.027472527472527

533899,4,6302969271,"A London Films creation, the movie Richard III was probably a modern marvel when it was first released in British Technicolor back in 1955. The cinematographer, Otto Heller, did a wonderful job and the technicolorone of the two major color motion picture processes of the timecreated a heavily saturated and vibrant look that brought out every little intricate detail of the costuming in a very gorgeous way. It also possessed very beautifully designed and authentic sets, including full scale castles, as well elaborate period costumes to make it all appear the more genuine. The movie likewise boasts an impressive, award winning cast of old school actors and actresses, including the legendary Sir Laurence Olivier and the beautiful Claire Bloom, both of which who had a presence in the theater and cinemas alike. Olivier not only plays the role of the title character, but also produced, co-wrote the screenplay, and directed the film. He did take a lot of creative liberties with the historical characteristics of the story, though the same can be said of Shakespeare as well; I don't believe it took away from anything so I didn't mind it. The description when I found this movie listed for a small fee on Amazon even praised Olivier for his work in all of those roles, especially as Richard claiming that this performance was even viewed as one of the greatest of his career. That being said, I personally found this adaptation of the play by William Shakespeare to be a bit lackluster.

Aesthetically I thought the movie was solid. The elaborate backdrops and the more or less static cameras even sort of evoke the feeling of watching the characters perform the scenes on a stage, with several instances of iconic theater body language and even occasions of the dramatic soliloquys being spoken directly to the audience. It is every bit as worthy of a theater stage as the it is the silver screen, and though the expressions and interactions could come off a little overly melodramatic at times because of this, I actually found this aspect to be rather enjoyable. None of these things took away from the story of the ambitious and manipulative man intent on gaining the throne occupied by his brother, Edward IV (Sir Cedric Hardwicke). In fact, I believe that many of these things are probably what made it so successful when it debuted. The overall cast was outstanding in spite of several roles being heavily reduced from the original play too, but the thing that I found so disappointing about this movie was actually Richard, the Duke of Gloucester himself. There were certain facets of the performance that I enjoyed. He delivered the lines with sincerity and definitely held his own against the other actors. However, for all that Olivier is an impressive actor, I thought he lacked the certain presence needed to accurately portray the depth and complexity of the character.

In spite of any historical accuracies or inaccuracies, Shakespeare wrote this historic tragedy and developed one of the most multifaceted and devious characters in all of literature. In the play, Richard is both the villain of the story as well as the protagonist. He is equally twisted and deformed in body and mind, yet also still highly intelligent, politically brilliant, and very manipulative. He can be chilling at times, especially for the atrocities enacted upon his own family in order to attain the crown. Olivier simply does not deliver this. He certainly goes through the motions of observing then systematically manipulating and murdering those around him to close the distance to the crown and place himself in power; he succeeds at seducing Lady Anne (Bloom) during the funeral of the murdered Henry VIeven though Lady Anne knows of the role Richard had in murdering both her late husband and her father. He likewise spoke the lines with a genuine passion. Olivier gave a decent try with his performance, but there was a distinct lack of power behind it to make it believable.

Would I recommend this movie? It depends. I will not deny that this film has a certain charm to it. There were several things about it that I even enjoyed. The production alone was incredible and I have a bit of a fondness for the vivacity of technicolor films. It is not difficult to imagine that this adaptation was probably once even considered an incredible feat and possibly even a stepping stone toward modern film or acting. I would recommend watching it at least once and give it a solid Four Stars for those reasons. However, it is rather hard to enjoy a movie when the lead is lacking. He was just too mild to play a ruthless man that essentially has no qualms what so ever about eradicating brothers, nephews, friends, wives, and anyone else who stands in the way of his royal aspirations and desires. I might just be a bit biased because I have watchedand admittedly preferthe 1995 interpretation of Richard III directed by Richard Loncraine. It stars Sir Ian McKellen, who adapted it from a previous the stage production that aired at the Royal National Theatre, and he is simply mesmerizing as Richard. After seeing it, I doubt anyone could live up to that performance. This version by Olivier is probably one that everyone should view just once though. I probably will never watch it again, but I am glad I watched it if only to see the beauty of the film. It is currently available to watch on both here on Amazon and on Hulu, so I encourage you to go make up your own mind whether or not you agree with my findings.",1471305600,,5517,4.817510548523207

To more modern tastes, including myself, Olivier overacts with ridiculous abandon.

The Blu-ray version is sharper, clearer, more colorful and perfect than any version you will see in the cinema or on TV (unless they are using this Blu-ray). It has been expertly, lovingly transcribed from the original negative,not from a worn out cinema print. And each frame has been repaired and revived. The bonus extras include an explanation of this process and a 1960s Ken Tynan (highly revealing) interview with Laurence Olivier. Then there is the play itself. Olivier worked tirelessly to develop a cinematic version of his theatrical chef d'oeuvre, reducing the grotesque nose length and speaking direct to camera (instead of to an entire theatre) in a way that was adopted decades later by Ian Richardson as the villainous Francis Urquhart, and, two more decades later, by Kevin Spacey in the epigone American series. Shakespeare's juvenile offering is of course a masterpiece of political propaganda, demonizing the last English king to die in battle and deliberately omitting his achievements, which include the first glimmerings of legal aid and the presumption of innocence. As Duke of Gloucester, Richard has his brother drowned in a butt of malmsey, apparently only because he stands between Richard and the crown. In fact, the Duke of Clarence had taken part in two rebellions against their brother, King Edward. Shakespeare, as an actor and writer with The Queen's Players, presumably felt it natural to show the ruling Tudors as putative deities, and Richmond (the future King Henry VII) is accordingly portrayed as such at the end of the film. Olivier's performance as the persuasive, devious pantomime villain is a delight. His utterance of ""I am not in the giving vein"" to Buckingham, which Olivier spent much effort in perfecting, is the crux of the whole play, and sounds like it. In the unlikely event that you are not a Shakespear enthusiast, just watch this film for the costumes, whose color and texture radiate in the excellent picture quality.",1429142400,7,2004,5.094224924012158

There is so much going on, and so much treachery and devilish machinations that one cant help but get caught up in it all.  I think those same pluses can be attributed as faults as well, since the film kind of gets messy in the translation.  It feels cluttered, and with so much going on it can get a tad confusing.

Ill also attribute that confusion to the very poor sound quality here (that echo made me want to break my television) and it was a distraction from the whole exercise.

I think that a lot was lost between Laurences stunning work on Hamlet and this production.  Some of the mystery and suspense is lost in Laurences attempt to make this a grander work.  I much preferred his intimate hand in the 1948 Oscar winner.  Here, Laurence extends himself a bit too far, and it shows.  He just didn't have the production values to carry his aspirations.  The final battle scene looks like it was staged in the woods behind my house, and because of that they really lose all life.  Olivier was also a bit of a tonally challenged actor.  He had this one note that he played to death, to the point where it feels like all of his Shakespeare productions could bleed into one another without a change of cast or characters.

The supporting work around him is pretty stellar, with both Mary Kerridge and Claire Bloom taking best-in-show notices (Bloom is especially moving as Richards tortured wife), but Olivier has such a straightforward vision that his film feels almost stilted in the arrangement.  There is a lack of life here, and while I applaud his devotion to Shakespeare and his ability to transfer stage to screen with integrity, sometimes you need a fresh voice to convey these themes.

534201,5,6302969271,"It is marvelous to watch Laurence Olivier strut and fret his hour on the stage. He has the uncanny ability to almost make you like Richard as he closes in to talk to the camera, closes in to talk to you, occasionally cracking an almost mischievous smile making you his confident. He is so magnificent an actor that he almost overwhelms the beautiful Shakespeare verse, making its majesty serve his purpose well. Even at his most nasty, such as deliberately lowering his hand which as King a courtier must kiss, causing the courtier to kneel, it is almost impossible to hate Richard.

Olivier plays Richard with a slight humpback, a game leg and a deformed hand, but he loses nothing in the way of virility. When he runs he scurries along rather like a crab, again not a creature inspiring contempt or pity but rather a sort of camaraderie. At one point he even swings down a bell rope, the bell ringing wildly its exuberant clang echoing Richard's triumph over becoming king. He gives one of his half-grins, almost a chuckle, when he leans towards us and hopes his new kingship ""will leave the world to me to bustle in."" In his very first scene, peering familiarly at the viewer he sets the tone for the whole movie with his superb rendering of the famous winter of our discontent speech.

The film is full of nuances which you may not notice the first time you view it. For instance, just after Edward IV is crowned, he passes his mistress Jane Shore and playfully touches her cheek with his scepter. The Queen scowls. Mistress Shore leaves all alone in her own carriage and is frequently seen in the company of lords, a knowing smile on her face.

The Earl of Richmond who destroys Richard at the Battle of Bosworth is a  noble looking young man, a far cry from the real lanky- haired,suspicious, somewhat shabby future Henry VII. Of course we have to go with Shakespeare, here, who was writing to glorify the new Tudor regime. But Olivier manages to give Richard a multi-layered personality and although the villain of the piece, an arch-villain in Shakespeare's eyes, you can't altogether hate him and that is Laurence Olivier's magic as the greatest Shakespearean actor ever.

The costumes and sets are magnificent, the colors rich. The use of shadows is effective and Richard casts a lot of them, and of course they are symbolic. ""Richard III"" is a work of art, a meticulous production from the hands of a master- the director, producer and star, Laurence Olivier.",1398816000,2,2470,4.682027649769585

It is still staggering to me how clearly the whole thing unfolds. Sometimes I have found Shakespeare's language difficult to access, but in this production, and especially Olivier's perfect performance, everything is utterly understandable. Fascinating for the particular intonation he adopts for various passages, such as '...Now is the winter of our discontent...' - a performance that is unsettling, giving us the image of a man set apart from others by how he has been made, so to speak. Repugnant, scheming, tortured, callous. In actuality, that really doesn't set Richard apart from many powerful figures across history, but the magic is in how Shakespeare has been able to communicate such vileness on the written page. True genius. Lawrence Olivier demonstrates what true acting means - to subjugate the ego, to disappear within the soul of the character, to become another, larger than life and the manifestation of evil jumps out at you. A superb supporting cast also. I found it captivating, unsettling, timeless, majestic, perfectly realised and so much more powerful because of the quality of the production. It is a pity that so many of the greatest actors of the stage have left us. It is fantastic that we have collections such as Criterion to remind us of their greatness and thus to immerse ourselves once more in such unparalleled artistry and accomplishment.",1384473600,3,1555,5.125984251968504

This movie really presents Richard III in an accessible and credible way, but it IS dated.  It is hard to get past the silly costuming and the flat photography for someone in the 21st century and just concentrate on the story.

After reading about the recent discovery of Richard the Third's skeleton in a car park, I decided to reacquaint myself with Shakespear's tale of the battle for the throne of England which was lost by Richard to Henry Tudor thus issuing in the line which would give us such notables as the infamous Henry III and bring and end to the plantagenet family rule. This story was written for the Tudors so one must expect the typical tale of the tyrant Richard rather than the portrait of his character painted by scholars today. Still it is amazingly well acted, produced and dirrected stared in by Oliver himself as Richard III.

534483,5,6302969271,"The last time I saw Laurence Olivier's rendition of Richard III before procuring the DVD I am now reviewing, was about thirty years ago.  I loved it then and never forgot it.  Most particularly, I never forgot Olivier's portrayal . . . Olivier's transformation into a conscienceless, subhuman fiend, yet with enough subtlety that this evil creature is competently portrayed as disguising his true nature from most of his acquaintances.  Viewing once again, on the DVD, Olivier's portrayal, and all of the great portrayals (Ralph Richardson, John Gielgud, Claire Bloom . . .) in this lavish though realistic production, my concluding opinion is that it has lost none of its power, none of its gripping intensity.

I received my DVD of Richard III subsequent to having just viewed Olivier's Hamlet.  Without question Hamlet is the better play.  It has so much more depth, dealing as it does, in this flesh dimension, with the value of existence itself.  Hamlet is an extraordinary person: among the highest type of human being-questioning himself, questioning life, even while knowing the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, though uncertain as which course of action his unique circumstance demands, while always thirsting for true true justice.  So the prince of Denmark takes the play to all of the above mentioned places; all of the levels, high and low, that exist in an intelligent, sensitive, questioning human being.  Whereas the character Richard III is a devil, a monster, a creature of the lowest order, the drama's plot being relatively simple: tracing Richard's lust for power and the corpses this lust leaves in its wake.  Yet the play is an historical epic; or certainly raised to that level with Olivier's colorful production.  However, though I consider Olivier's rendition of prince Hamlet to be one of the two greatest performances of all of the movies I have seen in my life (the other being Frederick March's rendition of Matthew Harrison Brady, i.e. William Jennings Bryan, in the classic Inherit the Wind), Olivier's performance as Richard is not lacking in the slightest way!  What determines that his performance as Hamlet is more remarkable is not Olivier's superior talent in that play as contrasted with his performance as Richard.  The contrast is between the plays themselves and between the two different roles.  The nuances of Hamlet's character, including his sensitivity, intelligence, depth of soul, make Hamlet a more demanding role than that of Richard, thus requiring use of the widest range of acting talent that can be required by any role.

Richard III is different than Hamlet, but it is a great play in its own right, and I think no better rendition of it can be found anywhere than that of the Olivier/Korda  production beautifully captured on this DVD.

As could be expected in a film starring and directed by Laurence Olivier, the acting is generally outstanding, except maybe for the death scene which is rather outr for today's tastes.

By current standards, this production clearly benefited from a relatively low budget, with much money certainly going to the battle scenes that involve considerable cavalry.  Thus, the sets and the minimal special effects look tacky and require a major `suspension of disbelief'.  Though the costumes were undoubtedly designed with much care, they are garishly colourful and often plain ridiculous, including the crowns adorning kings and queens in their daily activities and ... the tights worn by many male actors.  The loud and syrupy music, typical of the 1950's, overemphasizes dramatic moments.

534488,5,6302969271,"I have to admit that I only seen a couple of Richard III plays but his presentation stands out as it is the unique blending that explains the history and purpose of Richard III (Laurence Olivier) for those of us that only have a cursory knowledge of English history through film. We also get a look at the major players in the War of the Roses.

The presentation at times comes from our world and at others seems surreal.  Therefore, I suggest you watch the presentation as designed, and then watch with the commentary and again without. You will find yourself periodically re-watching this Criterion version and each time finding nuances' that were missed on the original viewing.

This film also give a lot of know actors a chance to express their talent and show that they do not out shine their character. Even though Claire Bloom (The Lady Anne) has been inserted in the play she adds significantly to the understanding of the events.

534529,5,6302969271,"Many excellent actors have tackled that ""foul lump of deformity,"" the hunchbacked Duke of Gloucester, a.k.a. Richard III. Among them such acting greats as Ian Mckellen and Al Pacino. Say ""Richard the Third,"" though, and I immediately think of a human spider with hooded eyes, a pageboy haircut, sharp nose, and halting chicken legs in black tights. In other words, I think of Laurence Olivier's Richard III.

This ranks as one of Lord Laurence's greatest performances, if not the greatest. It's certainly his most darkly sardonic and deliciously self-confident. Olivier was really at the top of his game when he made this movie in the mid-fifties, and his performance has the joie de vivre of an actor at the height of his powers. I was in a somewhat morose mood the other day when I popped this into the DVD player, and Olivier's infectiously energetic performance transported me to another world. Richard's a spiritual cousin to such scene-stealing villains as Iago of 'Othello' and Edmund of 'King Lear', and, like them, he's impossible to resist. This Richard embraces his own superficiality, takes malevolent delight in his clear-cut villainy.

Olivier surrounds himself with an all-star cast. Sir John Gielgud, he of the honey-dipped vocal chords, cuts a noble figure as Richard's doomed brother, Clarence, but is dispatched (memorably, in a barrel of wine) relatively early in the film. Claire Bloom, beautiful, brings poignancy to the underwritten Lady Anne. Sir Ralph Richardson is excellent as the politicking Buckingham.

Yet supporting characters fade into the periphery and all that's left is the highly quotable, irresistibly charismatic hunchback. Richard III is kind of like Hamlet's inverse: he doesn't know how not to act. He's like a shark that'd die if he stopped moving, and he consumes everyone in his path to the crown. Even on the battlefield, in the face of overwhelming odds, Richard goes out with a bang: ""My kingdom for a horse!"" In moments like those I'm like Lady Anne: falling for Richard against my better judgment.",1235865600,2,2047,5.104477611940299
534530,5,6302969271,"One of the greatest movies of the 1950s and in fact of all time, Laurence Olivier took Shakespeare's historic classic and turned it into a stunning masterpiece.
As for those who criticize the movie for it's slight departures from the written play, they obviously do not understand the versatility inherent in Shakespeare which allows for rich adaptation.
The movie begins with the last scene of Henry VI, with a fawning Richard, Earl of Gloucester (Laurence Olivier) ingratiating himself with the new King Edward IV (Cedric Hardwicke).
It is in the next scene where we view Richard's famous soliloquy: ""Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York, And all the clouds that glower'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried"".
Olivier is both frightening in his superb theatrical portrayal of the total evil of Richard, and blends Richard's wickedness with such wit that his plotting becomes a delight to watch.

His speeches to the audience about his own wickedness born of the resentments from his deformity, and the focus of the camera on his clawed hand are memorable. Olivier's face was made up for this movie and his nose cosmetically lengthened like a witches. His hands too are hooked and fingers deformed.

What stands out are the scene where he tries to woo the grieving Queen Anne (Claire Bloom) by the coffin of her husband, and she unleashes her contempt. Later after being forced to be Richard's bride we can see Anne's sadness that she knows she will die at Richard's hands. Richard's rage at a childish remark by one of the child-princes, his nephews, referring to Richard's shoulder (his frightening reaction accompanied by the child look of pure terror) where we know that the fate of the young princes has now been sealed. And who can forget the beautiful performances by Paul Huson and Andy Shine as the handsome little princes, so clearly born to one day be leaders (dying tragically at the hand of a tyrant reminding one of the later cruel murder by the Jacobins of the ten year old Louis XVII of France and by the Bolsheviks of the children of Tsar Nicholas II).
Richard III's quips about his own villainy:
""Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass; that I may see my shadow as I pass""
and ""But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
With odd old ends, stol'n out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil"".
Many of his speeches take place in a stately castle, often in front of large statuesque wooden doors.
The banner of Gloucester's Boar give background to the comments by The Lord Hastings that ""The cat, the rat, and Lovell the dog / Rule all England under the hog"".
And then there are the chilling visits on the night before the Battle of Bosworth of  a few Richard's victims: The young princes, the Duke Of Clarence, King Edward and Queen Anne.
The last battle sequence pits the forces of the Duke of Richmond's dragon against Richard's boar, and the final scene of Richard's killing by Richmond's forces, where Richard writhes like a rattlesnake before dying.

A splendid and sterling masterpiece, full of majesty and colour.",1199232000,,3211,4.67787610619469
534531,5,6302969271,"Indelible is the word for Olivier's personification of Richard III. The door swings gently open, and the monster takes you into his confidence. You become the co-conspirator and malevolent confederate. The character enters your mind and etches itself permanently into the memory. It's impossible to erase, and any later interpretations will always fight a losing battle. There are the usual customary petty complaints about the sets and the settings --- like Bosworth Field doesn't look like England. Who cares? Shakespeare's plays are about words and their delivery. Olivier delivers. Call it hammy, call it over-the-top, it's the way Will wrote it. It was good enough for Garrick, and Olivier was Garrick's heir. Makes your hair stand on end. Richard's deformities (sorry, disabilities) are absolutely central to the psychology of the part: you've got to feel a little sympathy for the man. He has a sense of humour, and finds his incredible success as a wooer both funny peculiar and funny ha-ha. He's also got guts: in for a penny, in for a pound. Devils just happen to be  more fascinating than angels. That's the way of things. I'm looking forward to getting this edition, as my present one has poor colours and no extras. P.S. The manner in which the production is filmed may be theatrical (and why not?), but it is also highly cinematic. The lighting, the shadows, the camera movements and the closeups all work perfectly.",1186099200,,1430,5.008403361344538

Opera lovers knows that one of the worst things ever is the fact that Maria Callas never recorded a full version of Verdi's Macbeth; luckyly, the olympic talent of Laurence Olivier created this jewel.

For me, it goes ahead even before Olivier's Hamlet: this very personal approach of the Duke of Gloucester goes surrealistic enough to be modern. I saw it first when I was a child and I will never forget the impression that Olivier's eyes caused.

Cast, with Gielgud, Richardson, Bloom and Hardwicke among others, supports Olivier's experiment transforming the text of Shakespeare almost in a modern thriller about the corruption of a soul obsessed with power beyond all limits.

It was necessary the maturity of another great stage and cinema actor (Al Pacino) to almost reach Olivier, but this one is still a landmark.",1177200000,3,919,4.834394904458598
534533,5,6302969271,"I have noticed that it is fashionable in some circles (particularly in the 'acting community') to be highly critical of Laurence Olivier and his interpretation of Shakespeare... While I have no credentials to speak of myself, I find these sorts of criticisms to be misplaced and they tend to unfairly take on Olivier without considering his times - Olivier was something of an outsider in his approach to Shakespeare - and the task of transfering his ideas of shakespeare into a rigid studio film (which nevertheless Olivier brilliantly succeeded in doing) would put Olivier right into a very vulerable place for an actor/director to be in.. Olivier was a believer in the human aspects of Shakespeare - he radically saw the possibility of a modern shakespeare - a shakespeare one could consider alongside the advent of modern psycohology and literature.. a sort of Freudian Shakespeare.. Now that Freud is also out of fashion it is easy to judge.. But the most important thing Olivier did had nothing to do with theories - he brought shakespeare to a larger audience - he made shakespeare more accessible.. He also did something only the best actors can do - he put his own personal stamp on the character of Richard III..His Richard is a serpentine feminine richard.. You clearly see a man who suffers within his body and mirrors this malace on to the world he confronts.. Olivier's Direction is also something remarkable - he combines the stage with celluloid in a way few have been able to manage... Criterion's transfer of this classic film is brilliantly crisp -you can't help but think of walt disney when you see this (or maybe powell and pressburger) - this is a perfectly legitimate portrayal of richard III and one that people will watch for years to come - what more could an actor achieve?",1171929600,6,1801,4.831715210355987

I already know that people generally LOVE Larry's,well, anything Shakespeare,BUT, as a Shakespearean actor myself,(and one whose favorite role is the Hunchback King),I must say that Richard's character has much more potential than Olivier's rendition reveals. Also,the play is abridged by about 30 min. of cut material,(in order to cement Richard's one-dimensional cast). I didn't particularly like Olivier's Shylock either. To be fair,his Hamlet is brilliant,but unfortunately,it too is abridged,like, where are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern anyway? Apparently this is done for the shorter attention span of the American audience?",1169078400,4,687,5.679611650485437
534535,5,6302969271,"No one could rival Laurence Olivier (Hamlet, Henry V, Richard III) as the scheming, ruthless youngest son of the 3rd Duke of York, who stopped at nothing to be King Richard III. His first appearance was deceptive. I noticed only a big nose and recognized him only after he spoke. Burdened with a crooked back, limp and shrunk hand, his ambition for kingship only burnt more feverishly. With disguised humbleness, he made peace with other royalties. His words were sugar-coated and gay. He killed Warwick, the 'KingMaker' who helped enthrone his elder brother as King Edward IV, and wooed Warwick's daughter Anne(the beautiful Claire Bloom) to marry him shortly after killing her husband. His planned murders of his elder brother Duke of Clarence, Lord Hastings, his young nephews (heirs-to-be), his wife Anne made even today's politics pale and unexciting.

Yet the movie about such a dark character was beautiful in VistaColour, set and costumes, cinematography. Scenes of executions, nave Lord Hastings (Alec Clunes) walking into his death trap, innocent heirs-to-be greeting uncle Richard and Richard's final battle are memorable. All the other characters exuded integraity, royality and humanity. They were handsome in appearance and noble in heart, so different from Richard III. Even the once accomplice Duke of Buckingham (Ralph Richardson), without whose help there would be no Richard III, showed a moment of caution in doing any more evil. Perhaps it's this great contrast between Richard and everyone else that made the movie luring and tragic. In his last battle of Bosworth Field, Laurence Olivier showed a more reflective and human side of Richard III. When nearly everything on his side was lost, he marched, with a handful of supporters including his royal page (Stewart Allen), and fought valiantly.

The movie also succeeded in its clarity and fluidity. The powerplay of an excellent cast of experienced actors with great screen presence made 155 minutes fly without notice. With no prior knowledge of the Wars of Roses (House of York vs House of Lancaster), I am not at all lost in the many characters and relationship. And the crowning of Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond, as Henry VII marked the beginning of the most filmed Tudor dynasty - a perfect prologue of films about the lives of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth.",1155772800,18,2341,5.1096605744125325
534536,5,6302969271,"Here is Olivier at his rollicking best.  This movie must be seen to be believed, and once seen will likely be regularly revisited throughout your life.  It is beyond superlatives.

The reviews on this site amply speak of this great film's riches.  While not one of the so-called ""major tragedies"" of Shakespeare, Olivier uses the play to to hammer home the most essential 101 level lessons about Shakespearean drama and performance -- its broad and physical appeal, its bald directness and outrageous humor, plain human pathos.  If your kids need to start somewhere with the Stratford Bard, this is the place.  It is highly likely that this single film will make a lifetime believer out of them -- and you too.

Olivier uses the adaptation of the play by the great British actor David Garrick from a couple centuries back, using the last part of Shakespeare's Henry VI, part 3, for necessary background, and then going off full-tilt into the best melodrama in the English speaking world.  There is no reason to set forth the plot -- Richard himself delivers it to you inch by inch as he schemes his awful trail to power.  Yet too, you laugh with him -- evil is not a black and white, Sunday school, cardboard cut-out proposition.  The drama faces you with its terrifying seductiveness.  This is a lesson once thought vital for developing adults in the English-speaking world, before the current monkey see/monkey do miasma of political correctness -- saying ""good things"" just to get ahead.  Indeed, Richard is nothing if not the epitome of political correctness.

Of course, the story of Richard's character, as Shakespeare presented it, is Tudor era propaganda writ large -- still subject to reasoned debate.  The drama, however, rightly retains its place  as absolutely central to the ethos of the English speaking world, and its cultural claims.  And Olivier nails it at all corners.  Simply, this movie is as essential as a good dictionary, a properly translated bible, and a fundamental background in literature and the language.",1141257600,5,2035,4.95575221238938

A filming accident gave Olivier a real limp during the shooting of the movie, by the way. His portrayal of Richard is riveting and, in the opinion of many, definitive.

As usual with Olivier's Shakespeare productions, his version is different from the written original, especially in the order of the scenes. But unless you are following along with the play in front of you, you will hardly notice. The battle finale on Bosworth Field is exciting and richly done.

Apart from the incredible film , which has helpful subtitles , you have an interview with Olivier on the second disc .

The Shakespearian actor can be a bit haughty and snobby , thinking they are as important as the words they are saying .

Olivier comes across as very thoughtful and is pleasant to watch as he makes his way through his own career .

This movie is based on William Shakespeare's history play of the same name that was written circa 1592.

The movie begins with introductory printed words:

""The following begins in the latter half of the 15TH century in England, at the end of a long period of strife set about by rival factions of the English crown, known as the Wars of the Roses.  The Red Rose being the emblem of The House of Lancaster [while] [t]he White [was] for The House of York.

The White Rose of York was in its final flowering at the beginning of [this] story...""

Then we are shown a brief ending to Henry 6th Part 3 and after this the camera zooms in on a solitary misshapen figure.  He is humpbacked, limping, a withered arm dangling from his side and he slowly drags himself toward the camera and utters this astonishing soliloquy (which is the actual beginning of the original play):

""Now is the winter of our discontent,

Made glorious summer by the sun of York,

And all the clouds that loured upon our house

In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

Now we our brows bound with victorious wreaths,

Our bruised arms hung for monuments,

Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,

Out dreadful marched to delightful measures.""

In his opening speech, Richard 3RD (Laurence Olivier, who also produced and directed) tells us his strategy, revealing the man behind the smiling mask.  He pledges himself to villainy, treachery, and conspiracy in order to acquire the crown.  By confiding in us, he chillingly pays us, as far as he is concerned, the supreme compliment: he makes us his accomplices.  He does this through most of the movie.

This viewer was mesmerized by his droll, mocking voice and by the sheer charisma of this man.  He has the tone of a highly refined villain:

""Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,

By drunken prophesies, libels, and dreams.

To set my brother...and the King

In deadly hate the one against the other...""

Richard's world resembles a chessboard, and he's now plotting his moves: four jumps and the throne is his.  All he must do is remove the obstacles: his brother, King Edward the 4TH (who conveniently dies) (Cedric Hardwicke ); his other brother George, the Duke of Clarence (John Gielgud); then his nephews, the young Prince Edward and Prince Richard.  And in the course of the play he also manages to dispose of his first wife, as well as several others who stand in his way.

After obtaining the crown through his devious, murderous ways, Richard quickly loses it in a final battle.  It is in this battle that he cries out, ""A horse! a horse!  my kingdom for a horse!""

For newcomers to Shakespeare, this is the place to begin.  The language is accessible; the acting could scarcely be better especially that of Olivier as Richard.  It's said that all subsequent portrayals of Richard are based on this version and that Olivier was the first to exploit this ""smiling villain's"" comic potential.  All supporting actors do an excellent job.

The vivid colors add to each scene of this movie based on a dark play.  As well, there is a rousing musical score.  My only minor complaint is that some scenes look staged.

Though not absolutely necessary, I would read a brief outline of the play's plot before I viewed this movie.  As well, I would have a list of the play's characters.  (I have mentioned many of the major characters above but there are quite a few minor ones as well.)

Finally, the DVD (released by Criterion in 2004) is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras that are worth exploring.

BOTTOM LINE:

This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.

534582,5,6302969271,"Sir Laurence Olivier's absolute mastery of another of William Shakespeare's timeless plays (his previous two self-directed efforts being ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"" [see my review on it]) is revealed yet again in this sumptuous adaptation of another of Shakespeare's most beloved tragedies. He is nothing but the absolute villain as Richard, Duke Of Gloster, who schemes to get the crown. His appearance was so scary, that he doesn't seem like the brooding Dane who won my sympathy in ""Hamlet,"" the jealous Moor who took my breath away in ""Othello,"" or the evil general who made me squirm in ""Spartacus."" He was an excellent actor, stepping into/becoming each character that he played. I really liked the camera showing his deformed shadow as he walked, his soliloquies to the camera, as if he were involving the audience in his wicked schemes and the way he was able to slither his way to the top unsuspected, NEVER backing down for even a second, evil to the end, not to mention the choice additions (the final scene from ""Henry VI, Part III"" and portions of a speech from that same play, which really fleshes out his character even further, so that we empathize with him throughout the film) and cuts (Queen Margaret and an interesting, but long scene between Richard, his mother, Margaret and Queen Elizabeth; if I forgot any others, let me know). As usual, Olivier cut a lot out, but that was just to keep the running time under 3 hours; you want uncut Shakespeare, see Kenneth Branagh's excellent, 4 hour take on ""Hamlet,"" also done masterfully by Sir Laurence Olivier (see my reviews on both of them). All the actors in this film did an excellent job, ESPECIALLY Olivier, who was nominated for Best Actor, but lost to Yul Brynner for ""The King And I"" (see my review on it); should've been a tie. The film opens with a great prologue to the story, for those who aren't familiar with the play, showing the cast of characters before AND AFTER the film. The royal-sounding score, as composed by Sir William Walton, who also scored Olivier's ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"" (see my review on it) is terrific. I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys Shakespeare, NOT the s**tty 1995 ""Remake"" (which I haven't seen, but the concept is just ""Bleah!!""; see my review of Luhrman's sh-tty ""Romeo + Juliet"" for more information) of this classic tragedy ""Of a hunchback who sought solace and glory in being a king."" What I really enjoyed about Olivier's films (mostly the Shakespeare, even those that he didn't direct, such as the 1965 stage production of ""Othello"" [see my review on it]) is his ability to transform a play into a movie, while maintaining the essence of theatricality at the same time (at the end of his ""Hamlet"" [see my review on it], you see that part of the scenery [the stage in the play] was a real stage, etc.)

My only complaint is that the VHS (the MUST-HAVE 2 Disc Collector's Edition DVD being priced at almost $28) is poor quality (but not so bad as to prevent you from seeing the picture clearly, isn't widescreen as it said it would be when I ordered it from this site and isn't closed-captioned (which I would definitely recommend to keep up with the dialogue, even if you are familiar with the Bard's works and know every line...or every FAMOUS line, that is), but it's not bad-quality wise, the movie is EXCELLENT. Only Kenneth Branagh can equal Sir Laurence Olivier in everything Shakespeare (they both produce, text-edit, direct AND star in most adaptations of Shakespeare, take leading and small roles in others, etc). This film is Not Rated.

The Criterion Edition of the film is well-worth it. It includes 20 minutes of footage cut from the VHS version, an interview with Sir Laurence himself, excerpts from his excellent book ""On Acting,"" a 12-minute trailer and more.",1111363200,2,3793,4.754172989377845
534583,5,6302969271,"This old classic has netted so many sterling tributes on the net review site - it seems pointless trying to cap them with more superlatives, much as the film - and Olivier's acting deserve them. Olivier's performance in this film absolutely electrified me as a young boy, and it still does. It turned me on to Shakespeare - and what a great thing acting can be, as a way of exploring the multi-faceted mysteries of human nature.

 The only thing I would wish to add - to what other reviewer's have had to say, concerns Olivier's adaption of Shakespeare to the screen/film medium. Some feel that Olivier's Richard III is a bit 'stagey' - that Olivier failed to make maximum use of the camera, technically. It is surely obvious that Olivier expressly intended the film to look 'stagey' - to convey the feeling of theatre. The make-up is purely 'Stratfordian' and traditional. Admittedly, it comes over different - on film, but satisfying, because it still feels 'Stratfordian' (you can almost smell the grease-paint, and imagine nose extensions being applied in the dressing room). In key respects, Olivier made intelligent use of the camera - bringing a greater intimacy between the audience - and Richard's scheming soliliquies - than would otherwise have been the case - watching the play in a theatre. Otto Heller's camera-work and lighting has generally been praised, satisfying the requirements of Olivier's instincts - as a director. This film dates back to 1956 - and yes, it was a 'low budget' movie, compared to Hollywood productions, past or present. Britain wasn't that wealthy in the 1950's (t.v. had barely arrived, for most people). Buying tickets for the theatre in Stratford would have made a large hole in most pockets, so the advent Henry Vth and Richard III - at the cinema, was the first chance many had to see Shakespeare's 'plays' in action. What with the addition of William Walton's music, the extra pageantry afforded by the use of film - this was a real treat to watch, and it still is!",1108598400,,2011,4.826086956521739
534584,2,6302969271,"This is a splendidly acted filmed play - notice how I write ""filmed play"" for this is by no means a masterpiece in anything but acting.  Do not misinterpret what I say - Laurence Olivier's performance is a SPELLBINDING one, and, as with almost all the cast members, is just absolutely magnificent.

However, acting can only hold one's attention for all of ""Richard III"" if that person is a lover of the stage, because this `movie' feels like nothing more than filmed play.  I don't give a damn how good the acting is - I'm a film major and was abhorred at the lack of use of cinematic techniques.  Editing, camera angles, lighting, lenses, and so on could have taken this movie to another level.

I do not believe that a film should ever be so bland in its making - Technicolor is invariably the wrong choice for this, although that probably reflects the public's demand of it, so I'll let that slide.  The fact of the matter is, filming techniques COMBINED with those stellar performances would have made a knock-out hit.  Even if I attended theater performances regularly, I would still have disliked this movie, because it is not a movie and does not deserve that title.  This could have been one of the greatest films of our time (it was, after all, originally written by the greatest author of ALL time), but instead I found myself looking at my watch because it failed to glue my eyes to the screen.

If you want a glimpse of combining technique with acting, watch Al Pacino's ""Looking For Richard"" (1996).  It is filmed documentary style with handheld cameras and luminous lighting, which, although may not be the best way to film it, at least is one way to FILM it, creating a FILM.  I happen to believe that Pacino's film is a great movie and a must see for anyone who purchases this film.

So, if you love the theater or are a Shakespeare nut, go ahead and buy it - you'll love Olivier's performance (it's almost impossible not to).  But if you are a film lover first-hand, you will undoubtedly be disappointed.",1101945600,12,2021,4.5497237569060776

The camera shots are very long and there are very few shifts in angles, there are almost no close-ups, the settings, costumes and makeup are overdone and look too fake and low-budget (perhaps on purpose?), and it's done almost entirely in a studio (the outdoor battle scenes feel like a Western..). The result is that you feel that you're watching a two-dimensional play. Perhaps black-and-white would have been a more suitable vehicle.
I'm also annoyed with the liberties the movie has taken with the text, shifted scenes around, chopping lines, etc. I didn't like that it begins with a scene from Henry IV. The Bard's original structure is better. Stick with it!
Also, for the first half of the movie I felt distant from Richard, possibly because until then we almost always see him from a distance and rarely up close. That changes once he become king. Overall, the second half is much better.
If you want to see a truly great Shakespeare adaptation, watch ""Julius Caesar"" with Marlon Brando and James Mason, even though the play itself is not as good as Richard III.
In spite of all this, I recommend it. Certainly worth seeing Olivier in action.. and it has some great moments.",1084147200,14,1437,4.729083665338646
534587,5,6302969271,"I won't rehash the plot. Suffice to to say the Olivier's performance is magnificent. Also magnificent in this Criterion collection edition, is the addition of a top notch commentary which explores both Shakespeare's structure of the play and Olivier's decisions in bringing the character to the screen. Also interesting is a 1960's era interview with Olivier that reviews his acting career.",1083542400,5,390,5.409836065573771
534588,5,6302969271,"Those who criticize Laurence Olivier and Alan Dent -- co-authors of the screenplay -- for taking certain liberties with Shakespeare's play should also criticize Shakespeare for taking certain liberties with the historical material on which he often relied so heavily. In this instance, Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland, Vol. 6, and various Tudor Historians. In my opinion, such quibbling is a fool's errand. This much we do know about the historical Richard III. He was born in 1452 in Fotheringay Castle, Northamptonshire, the youngest son of Richard, Duke of York. He was created Duke of Gloucester by his brother, Edward IV, in 1461, accompanied him into exile (1470), and played a key role in his restoration (1471). Rewarded with part of the Neville inheritance, he exercised vice regal powers, and in 1482 re-captured Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Scots. When Edward died (1483) and was succeeded by his under-age son, Edward V, Richard acted first as protector, but within three months, he had overthrown the Woodvilles (relations of Edward IV's queen), arranged for the execution of Lord Hastings (c. 1430-83), and had himself proclaimed and crowned as the rightful king. Young Edward and his brother were probably murdered in the Tower on Richard's orders, although not all historians agree. He tried to stabilize his position but failed to win broad-based support. His rival Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), confronted him in battle at Bosworth Field (August 22, 1485), when Richard died fighting bravely against heavy odds. Though ruthless, he was not the absolute monster Tudor historians portrayed him to be, nor is there proof he was a hunchback.
Cleverly, this film begins with the final scene of Henry IV, Part III, the coronation of Edward IV (Cedric Hardwicke). Locating himself at a strategic distance from the throne, the Duke of Gloucester (Olivier) carefully observes those around him. He shares with those who see this film or read the play his most private thoughts and feelings, many of which are as deformed as his body. Gloucester's ""winter of discontent"" will soon end. With a systematic tenacity unsurpassed by any other of Shakespeare's villains, Gloucester's coronation as Richard III (his own ""glorious summer"") will be the fulfillment of his royal ambition. The acting throughout the cast is outstanding. I do not recall another film in which Olivier, John Gielgud (George. Duke of Clarence), and Ralph Richardson (Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham) all appeared together, joined by Claire Bloom (Lady Anne Neville) and Stanley Baker (Henry Tudor). Special note should also be made of Otto Heller's cinematography which is integrated seamlessly with their performances. It is a pleasure to have this film now available in a DVD format, one which offers much sharper images and much clearer sound. Other special features of this DVD version include high-definition digital transfer; newly discovered footage; a  commentary by playwright and stage director Russell Lees and John Wilder, former Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company; 1966 BBC interview with Olivier hosted by Kenneth Tynan; a 12-minute television trailer; a theatrical trailer; and an  essay by film historian Bruce Eder.",1077580800,119,3242,5.330078125
534589,5,6302969271,"In what I deem Laurence Olivier's finest Shakespearean performance, Richard III is quite simply an absolute must see for any true Shakespeare aficionado.  Having just read the play and viewed the movie subsequent to the reading, I was afraid I might be somewhat disappointed after such an enjoyable read.  Not the case.
From the word go, or rather the words ""Now is the winter of our discontent,"" Olivier adroitly plays a most egregiously evil, yet sinfully likable, villain.  Olivier's skillful mastery of the soliloquy is readily manifest as he conspiratorially confides in the audience his countless connivances and sordid schemes as he maniacally murders and manipulates all of those unfortunate enough to be in his way on his morbid quest for the crown.  He's so good you'll find yourself rooting for the dastardly villain that is Richard III.  Pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.",1076457600,8,890,5.068493150684931
534590,5,6302969271,"""Richard III"" was the third film I ever saw based on a play by William Shakespeare.  The first two were Franco Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  Watching Laurence Olivier's Richard approach the camera, hold his hunchbacked body at an odd angle, and declaim ""Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York.""  By the time Richard's opening monologue, with additionally dialogue pulled from a similar speech in ""Henry VI, Part III,"" I was totally convinced me that if I ever played Shakespeare on stage it was this part that I wanted to play (for lead parts that remains true, although I have a great affection for John of Gaunt in ""Richard II"").
Now I know that Olivier's portrayal of Richard Crookback is an extension of the interpretation he first brought to the stage in 1944.  At the time all I knew was that the tradition was that an actor performed Richard before he tackled Hamlet.  I was not sure why this should be the case at the time, but I have a sense of it now for whereas the Prince of Denmark is doomed by his failure to act, Richard, Duke of Glouster and thereafter King of England, is relentless in his pursuit of the crown.  The idea of Olivier's Richard as a malevolent spider is apt, for he is beyond the stereotype of the power-hungry politician.  He is a ruthless, dominant, and unforgettable figure, who consumes everything in his way and ultimately himself.  The cast of this 1956 film includes John Geilgud, Ralph Richardson, and Cedric Hardwicke, but these actors have no more chance of standing up against Olivier's performance than their characters do of stopping Richard.  For me the most memorable scene ends up being when Richard seduces the Lady Anne (Claire Bloom) over her husband's coffin, probably because that is the point at which Richard's ascension is assured as well as where he goes over the line.
The job by Olivier and Alan Dent, his text advisor, of making Shakespeare's play accessible to the masses who attend the movies is rather brilliant, not only in terms of the cuts (e.g., the character of Queen Margaret) but also the choice additions as well (the coronation of King Edward IV).  The use of the crown motif is made clear without being forced, providing a cinematic way of reinforcing the power struggle, and we also have the overly bright Technicolor photography of Otto Heller giving a sense of pageantry to the proceedings.  But we keep coming back to Olivier's performance and his dramatic appearance: the long black hair, the thin lips, the deformed left hand, the elongated nose, the crooked back and the sidling walk.  It is no wonder that during the dark days of Watergate the idea of Richard Nixon as the American modern version of Richard Crookback took such a hold in my imagination.  However, since I have seen this film there is only one other character whose evil has been as overwhelmingly charismatic, and that would be Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter.  This is only a minority opinion because very few people have seen both films.  But if you have, then I would think you be inclined to agree.",1072915200,16,3123,4.736162361623617
