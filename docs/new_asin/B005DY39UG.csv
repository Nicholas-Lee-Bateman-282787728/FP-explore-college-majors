4663125,5,B005DY39UG,He loves it and the price better than department stores!,1394668800,,56,4.7

4663127,5,B005DY39UG,"Of course, they depart quite a bit from the original storyline, and there is a lot of blood flying, but the portrayal of Spartacus vs. Crassus is first rate.",1393718400,,157,4.448275862068965
4663128,5,B005DY39UG,"The Spartacus series is about a time when Rome ruled over nearly everything. Rome was a super power to say the least during its time. Gladiators were one of the most common forms of entertainment, along with lots of sex and alcohol. The story of ""
Blood and Sand"" introduces us to a Thracian warrior to which we do not know his name. I will not spoil any large details, but after he is eventually captured by Roman soldiers(for which reason I will not mention) he is thrust into the world of kill or be killed. While Spartacus may have too many sex scenes for my liking. There is an occasional slow spot in the series but those parts are required to progress the story in good fashion. The action and the plot that rapidly grows as the story goes is pure genius. If you are like me and like your action and violence to be more often then not, then Spartacus is an excellent series to turn to. If you have not yet watched a series from Starz, I would certainly recommend this at the top of the list.",1392336000,,998,4.257894736842105
4663129,5,B005DY39UG,Great box set for the Spartacus fan. I was given this set as a Christmas gift and really enjoy the great digital picture on my bluray.,1384732800,,134,4.1923076923076925
4663130,5,B005DY39UG,"Great deal that I have only found on Amazon but I had issues with the disc skipping and Amazon sent a replacement extremely fast. Not a show for everyone. A little campy, extremely bloody, explicit nudity and sex reign supreme in a show that I think paved way for shows like Game of Thrones. Gods of the Arena is actually a prequel mini series to Blood and Sand but needs to be watched after BaS. Definitely will purchase seasons two and three when I'm done watching these.",1384387200,,473,4.448275862068965
4663131,3,B005DY39UG,Awesome show with over the top bloody seens but the packaging  really sucks DVD on cardboard for the loss good price on the combo,1382313600,,129,4.375
4663132,5,B005DY39UG,"This TV  series is awesome in every way. Excellent made in all aspects story, cast, well directed, costumes, etc)  Very entertaimning.",1378512000,,134,5.333333333333333
4663133,5,B005DY39UG,"By far something that must be watched by everyone!! Nothing comes close to this one Guys, the story is great, the characters are even better , gives you everything you can handle , excitement, sadness, sex,violence, and gore. Dont miss spartacus my favorite show on TV.",1378512000,,269,4.869565217391305
4663134,5,B005DY39UG,"This is by far the best show ever, if you love gore, killing, sex, and war then this is a must buy",1375920000,2,98,3.5
4663135,2,B005DY39UG,"The extras doesn't run quite good, the package is good and original, but not easy to pull out the discs.....
Good price but the product is not so good.....",1375833600,,155,4.379310344827586
4663136,5,B005DY39UG,"This combo pack was a great way to get the first seasons of this great series on blu ray.  While the effects in the first season may not have aged well, the acting and storytelling are top-notch.  The commentaries and bonus features are great too.  This series is not for the faint of heart.

I did not experience the skipping and other problems some other reviewers had.  My discs worked just fine.",1375488000,4,399,4.486111111111111
4663137,4,B005DY39UG,That's why I don't like buying refurbished Dvds/Blurays. Had to return it for a full refund. Never again will I buy refurbished.,1374624000,,128,4.863636363636363
4663138,5,B005DY39UG,Good show for a great price. I hope to see more prices like this in the future. I do not mind buying  used blue rays just as long as they play.,1371600000,,143,3.6129032258064515
4663139,5,B005DY39UG,"I would have spent over $60 in the store for both sets of movies but paid wwwaayyyy less, and Im very happy with this product. A truly great value!!",1369180800,3,148,4.137931034482759
4663140,5,B005DY39UG,"Packaging was excellent, and a great over all deal. Two seasons for less than the price of one at a retailer.",1368057600,3,109,4.238095238095238
4663141,5,B005DY39UG,"Who doesnt like burly men cutting off some limbs in the old Roman Empire setting?  Well casted, well written and well filmed.  A shame it only aired on Starz before going to disc.  But if you were fans of Gladiator years ago this will bring back a fair amount of the flair that movie had and then some.  Good special effects and gracious use of gore and blood puts this on par with 300.

If you heard anything on this series and were interested, take a look.  It will not disappoint.",1367712000,,483,4.252747252747253
4663142,5,B005DY39UG,"By far my favorite show of all time. Bought this as used-very good but it was brand new. Yes, it froze in 5 scenes during the entire season, but picked right back up. For the $11.50 I paid for it, I can deal with 5 small freezes, opinions will vary. Had I paid $30 or more, I would have sent it back. Tons of blood, sex, and violence. What more could you ask for?!",1366502400,,364,3.9324324324324325
4663143,5,B005DY39UG,"Great entertainment, watching dvd over and over. Told all my friends about it and let them sample now half off them own it",1365206400,,122,4.3478260869565215
4663144,5,B005DY39UG,The Spartacus: Blood and Sand / Gods of the Arena blu ray collection is awesome.  Now i don't have to keep them on my DVR.  This is such a great series.,1365120000,,152,3.870967741935484
4663145,5,B005DY39UG,awesome series --  I've only watched the first season but if the gods of the arena and second season are just as good then I will do the marathon like I did for the 1st season within 2 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had skipping problems too though!,1364256000,,243,4.4
4663146,1,B005DY39UG,The item was claimed to be new but it was opened and the corners of both box sets were damaged and definatly used I won't be ordering through them again.....EVER!!!!,1363392000,,165,4.533333333333333
4663147,4,B005DY39UG,"I like very much this TV series, is different if you like Gladiator from Russel Crow you will love this TV series.",1363392000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4663148,5,B005DY39UG,My friend loves this show through and through. he would love to see it in 3 d in the future.,1363046400,,92,3.65
4663149,5,B005DY39UG,"I had originally ordered this set from Amazon, but the discs would skip and kept messing up so i had to return it.  So I ordered this one to replace it, it came really fast, and the setup was nicer than the one i bought from Amazon.",1361318400,,232,3.9361702127659575
4663150,5,B005DY39UG,I has great quality. It is very enjoyable. I waiting for the third season to go on sale so I can purchase it.,1361059200,,109,3.782608695652174
4663151,1,B005DY39UG,"Great show, but unfortunately one of the discs skips.  I ordered several months ago and just got around to watching and now I can't return since it's outside the return window.  Tried on two blu ray players with the same results.  Did some research and discovered that disc 3 (Blood and Sand) problems are being reported by numerous folks.  Disc 3 episode 1 is where I'm having problems.",1360886400,4,387,4.647058823529412
4663157,5,B005DY39UG,"Great show, I will need to find where I put this so I can watch it... wait I think I know where I put it.",1359590400,,105,3.24
4663158,2,B005DY39UG,"some of the discs skip at certain points of the movie.  I have not finnished all of them,for now though it gets a 2 star",1357948800,2,120,3.8
4663159,1,B005DY39UG,"Let me start out by saying that I absolutely LOVE this show.  Not a single bad episode, in my opinion.  The only reason I rate this so low is the discs skip constantly and some episodes don't even start until about 5-6 minutes into the episode.  I've tried it on multiple blu ray players, but the issue persists.  Bought this as a gift for my brother, who is also a huge fan of the show so it doubly disappointing.  I know not all the discs have this issue, but it sucks that these had to be ours.",1357776000,2,497,4.082474226804123
4663160,1,B005DY39UG,"I ordered this set twice with the same outcome.  It would not play properly.  I have a brand new Blu-ray player and attempted to play the first disc, but both times the disc froze.  This has only happened with this set and no other blu-ray disc.",1357257600,3,245,4.282608695652174
4663161,5,B005DY39UG,"This show could be considered soft porn by some however I absolutely love the story line and how all of the characters intersect. It is definitely my guilty pleasure, much like ""Hercules"" with Kevin Sorbo was back in the day.",1357084800,,225,4.65
4663162,5,B005DY39UG,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas, it was on special as I recall. Great Blu-ray collection, both season 1 and 2 are included. The only gripe that I kind of hame for this item is the packaging. It's that cardboard like case and was kind of dented on one end, not a big deal but it kind of irked me. Other than that, great item.",1357084800,,332,3.970149253731343
4663163,5,B005DY39UG,"These is a excellent production, history line is going to make you ask for more, the detail of arquitectural, dressing & social facts of the Roman decadency  is incredible",1356739200,,171,4.896551724137931
4663164,5,B005DY39UG,"Perfect show for the action/historical drama fan. Has everything you desire in a cable TV show - Sex, Drama, and the ACTION! I bought to catch up and get ready for the coming season in January. A MUST WATCH show!",1356652800,,212,4.325
4663165,5,B005DY39UG,It is a very great deal.  Two seasons for a such a low price.  It was a must buy for me.,1356652800,,88,3.142857142857143
4663166,5,B005DY39UG,"If you are a fan of Spartacus, and you should be, then you need to add this to your collection!",1356652800,,95,3.8
4663167,5,B005DY39UG,"The box it comes in is very unique.if you love this show like me,blue ray is a must.if you havnt watched the series,its one of the most violent sexual shows you will ever watch",1356652800,,176,4.205882352941177
4663168,5,B005DY39UG,"This show is like a cross between ""Rome"" and ""300"" with a bit of Skinemax mixed in! Every season is worth twice as much as I paid for it!",1356566400,,137,3.7586206896551726
4663169,3,B005DY39UG,"Great DVD,this was Christmas present, except the third disc in Blood and Sand has a small section that does not play",1356480000,,116,4.571428571428571
4663170,5,B005DY39UG,"Great series. The story of Spartacus in the arena told in high def. Starz did a magnificent job bringing Spartacus to life, and telling the story of how he and Craixus overcame the romans to eventually free Rome.",1356393600,,212,4.605263157894737
4663171,5,B005DY39UG,"Worth every penny. If you like action mixed with an epic story filled with an excellent cast, your on the right track. Was recieved in good condition, as amazon does.",1356048000,,166,4.566666666666666
4663172,1,B005DY39UG,"I'm on my second set of these Bluray discs and the 2nd episode of both have scenes that have stuttered, pixelated, froze, and fast forwarded. These have come with the yellow stripe on the plastic sleeve.",1355443200,6,203,4.666666666666667
4663173,5,B005DY39UG,"Such a spectacular and addictive series. From start to finish, this show keeps you hooked and never lets go. They picked the perfect actors and actresses and it truly makes you feel like you are in ancient Rome. Though I am not quite sure how historically accurate it is... it is HBO after all.
If you like the movie gladiator or anything of that like, this series is a MUST SEE! Like any good HBO show its got all the necessities; action, blood, gore, nudity, drama a fantastic mix in each episode.
Highly recommended!",1355356800,,519,4.531914893617022
4663174,5,B005DY39UG,"Amazing deal. I got this during the Black Friday lightning deal for $35. I am very pleased with this product. The only thing to complain about is that the two seasons are too short! I finished Blood and Sand in one sitting. That's almost 12hours straight. The story is great and the action and sex scenes are very engaging.

I do hate digibooks because of the difficulty in getting the discs from the holder. But I can live with it. For fight/action fans, this one is a must-have.

For a view of this product, just search ""Amazon Exclusive Spartacus 2 Season""",1355184000,,559,4.524752475247524
4663175,4,B005DY39UG,"My wife and I enjoy these shows.  There is gratuitous nudity, sex, violence, vulgarity, and no sensitivity.  It's refreshing to watch a show where no one is sensitive.  If you enjoy scandal, mass amounts of gore, and tons of sex where everyone is as oiled as a hair care product, you'll love this show!  Of course, there's some plot thrown in there too...",1354838400,,355,4.587301587301587
4663176,3,B005DY39UG,"After receiving this ""box"" set and opening the first season package I noticed that the disks were put in between two solid folds of paper(cardboard idk) instead of the plastic holds that disks usually clip into. This made me wonder if I would scratch the disks just taking them out. Soon as I saw this I knew I wouldn't be using this to hold my disks after viewing. Sure enough after putting the first disk in, after a while I found that the each episode would pause and skip at certain spots. I pull the disk out and notice some odd circular scratch around the center (light scratch) and kinda an odd pattern round it as well. Pull out all other disks and see the same issue. So since then returned this to Amazon hassle free (Amazon always does a great job with all forms of shipping). The show itself from the first disk I sat through (trying to ignore the skips until I found it happening to frequently) seemed pretty great. Plenty of action and seemed less predictable then I thought it would be, from the four episodes I viewed anyway. The packaging and disk damage is why this gets 3 stars over 5.",1354579200,10,1104,4.390243902439025
