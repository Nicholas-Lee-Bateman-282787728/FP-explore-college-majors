All your favorite actors sit down to ""A dinner for 5"" and talk about experiences and encounters in filming their movies. A true gem of a show!",1436572800,2,245,4.3478260869565215
8230442,1,B000Y056XM,"I live in Australia and am REALLY frustrated that I can't download this material based on geography.  I have heard great things about the Vince Vaughn/Rory Cochrane episode but can't buy it on dvd, it's not shown on Australian tv and we can't download it through either Amazon or iTunes.  This system means if you live outside the USA you might as well live on the freakin' moon!!  IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!  Come on Amazon - look after your international customers as well.",1324080000,,466,4.716049382716049
