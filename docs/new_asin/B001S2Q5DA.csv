8339376,4,B001S2Q5DA,"Less well known than Area 51, but with even better evidence of the existence of UFOs! Area 51 is full of obvious cover ups and lies, and while obviously the government couldn't hide the aliens from us they did a great job of mixing up all the information. Aberystwyth is FULL of very concrete evidence, and has proven to be much more difficult to discount that Area 51. This is why more people have heard about Area 51--aberystwyth is a bigger threat to the powers that be.",1374883200,,473,4.448275862068965
8339377,5,B001S2Q5DA,The fact that there are actually pieces of metal from this crash is amazing. The truth is right in front of our eyes. It's almost as if it scares people too much too actually acknowledge it. Must see for the ufo fans.,1374883200,,217,4.190476190476191
8339378,4,B001S2Q5DA,"Having studied Roswell, Area 51, etc. this video was of great interest to me. I think there is no doubt that the piece of wreckage they have from this crash is not of this earth. UFOs are worldwide, time to study up.",1359072000,,216,4.166666666666667
8339379,5,B001S2Q5DA,"This definitely isn't the first story of its kind, where there's some overwhelming UFO activity and the government steps in to remove all evidence and try to convince people that they never saw or experienced what they did.  But this story is different from the others I have researched.  A chunk of a UFO remains...they weren't able to gather ALL the evidence.  And nobody can trace where this chunk came from, no company manufactured stuff like it.  It's very cool.  I thought I'd heard it all & was just looking to supplement my knowledge, I didn't expect to learn anything new here, but I did.",1355961600,,597,4.647619047619048
8339380,3,B001S2Q5DA,"The lead figure in this film, Mark Olly, tries far too hard to appear like some mystery figure; an old fashioned ""highway man"" of old Britain.  In truth, you would expect to see exactly such characters in this costume making the rounds at all the renaissance faires, or as an unpaid extra on the set of The Fellowship of the Ring, lurking around the Prancing Pony Inn, spying on Frodo.  Such a pathetically, quasi-comical appearance does little but distract from the meager content this film contains.  It is also a (much deserved) invitation to all those rabid debunkers who like to point to the entire subject of UFO research as the domain of nuts, kooks, and those who live in the twilight zone between the real world and the world of their runaway imaginations.  Truly, Mark, if you want your opinions and the information you wish to convey to be taken as anything other than a joke, drop the Dennis Moore attire (Monty Python fans will know exactly what that means!)  Good grief, man, your viewers are all afraid you're going to rob them of their Lupins.  Put on some clothing that is at least circa twentieth century, and maybe, just maybe, someone watching will take you seriously.

As to content, there is precious little of interest here.  Nevertheless, there is the tiniest smidgen, so I rated this one at 3 stars.  Production values are close to non-existent.  Anyone with a modern, digital video recorder could do a much better job with very little effort.  If this had been a project for a junior high class in cinematography, Mr. Olly would be fortunate if his instructor did not fail him for the class.  It's exceptionally amateurish.  I rated it at 3 stars, and someone could make a case with very little effort that this is far too generous a rating.  It is definitely not a $20 DVD.  One sometimes runs across videos at the bargain bin at Walmart for $2.99 or $4.99.  Maybe it would be worth it at that price, but certainly it isn't worth any more.

Would I buy it again, knowing what I know of it now?  For the comedic value...  Hmmmmm... Tough call.  But, no, I have to say I would pass on this one if I had it to do again.  It certainly isn't a video I'm going to pull out and show to anyone who comes calling on me at home.",1314489600,2,2245,4.466830466830467
8339381,4,B001S2Q5DA,"A friend of mine worked at area 51 for awhile and, although he was sworn to secrecy, he did tell me that there were things he saw that were very ""exotic."" Things he had never witnessed since.  Although I respect his vow of ""loose lips sink ships"" I get the feeling that what happened in Roswell NM isn't a lone incident.

Europe's Roswell, UFO Crash in Aberystwhyth proves this.  There were so many witnesses to this strange happening and some pieces of this strange ship were left behind.  These aren't tiny pieces either, one is about a 12""x12"" and doesn't look like anything I've seen in my life.  If it was simply a weather balloon or some other easily explainable happening, why the big cover up?  Governments don't want us to know about these beings.  I found this DVD to be fascinating and another notch in the ""UFO proof"" belt.",1274140800,2,835,4.526666666666666
8339382,5,B001S2Q5DA,"On January 23, 1983, something happened on a farm in Aberystwyth, Wales, which covered a farmer's land with a wide area of metal/resin/foil debris.  From here, the story is very similar to the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO story.  The police were called and couldn't figure out what it was, the RAF showed up, couldn't identify the chunks of material, were certain it wasn't one of their aircraft, then the Ministry of Defense shows up and removes every scrap of evidence, or so they tried.

The twist here, which makes this little documentary truly amazing, is that whatever crashed in the fields, first sheered off the tops of the trees of a nearby woods, and deposited debris where UFO researchers found their own samples before officialdom actually leveled the woods to the ground and sealed the area.

We get a good look at a number of chunks of this wreckage, one piece a foot square.  It's some sort of composite material, 6-sided honeycombed foil/metal stuff sandwiched between a plastic resin, still never identified.

Even after all these years, all that can be deduced from analysis is that yes, this is some sort of material you might use for an aircraft, but no, nobody knows who makes this, or how.  It's very strong and very light and that's the whole story.

And we get to see it.  I think it's the real thing.  I think it's amazing.",1273622400,2,1344,4.680851063829787
8339383,4,B001S2Q5DA,"if you are into this subject, this is worth seeing, especially at reduced ""used"" price",1246492800,2,86,4.8
8339384,5,B001S2Q5DA,Europe's Roswell is just what you would think it would be.  The study and explanation of a UFO crash in Aberystwyth that rivals our own Roswell.  Interesting and compelling cash for a UFO crash.  Entertaining and well worth the time to see this little film.,1236902400,5,257,4.666666666666667
