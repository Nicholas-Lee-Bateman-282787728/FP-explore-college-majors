8647188,5,B00J11U52C,"4 1/2 STARS FOR OUTSTANDING MOVIES BUT EXCLUDED EXTRA DISCS IN SOME INSTANCES.  FOR THOSE LOOKING, THIS IS NOT THE AWARD WINNING DOCUMENTARY OF THE SAME NAME.  ***SLEEK, BUT BARE BONES SET FOR AN ECONOMY PURCHASE IF YOU GET THE RIGHT PRICE.***

At time of writing, there was almost no detail in this Amazon listing regarding what is included in the poorly named set (which is dressed to look like the documentary of the same name).  Many of the great movies are not actually about D-Day, though that in itself is not a problem.

This set contains already released war films lumped together in a single box set.  The box is sharp looking though simple, sturdy enough looking, card stock. A single, thick blu ray jewel case slides into the side entry of the box or sleeve and houses all the discs.  Movies included are:

The Longest Day
The Great Escape
Battle of Britain
Patton
Tora! Tora! Tora!
A Bridge Too Far

******There is only one disc per movie so in any case where the movie has a multi-disc release elsewhere (like Patton or The Longest Day 3 disc set), you are not getting those program extras.  However, any extras found on the main discs of individual releases, like the Coppola introduction to Patton, will also be found in this release since the main discs were carted over pretty much as is.

This set does include a simplistic D Day map fold-out and some collector's cards from the movie ""The Longest Day"" that are about post card size and appear as photos of the D-Day landing (but from the film).  I would not buy this version just for those small tokens while giving up much of the digital extras from the individual releases.  If you have not already started collecting the movies, prefer condensed packaging, and don't care about things like extras, then this set is definitely the right way to go - if the price is right.  I suggest a much lower entry point than the $100+ price when the set was first released.  It has been offered below $30, which is definitely cheaper than collecting every movie separately.

It would take more than a page to review each of these very famous movies individually and they each can be viewed on their own Amazon page so I will leave it with just a product description.  Personally I like the extras on some of the individual releases where normally extras don't matter to me.  Usually it's historical movies that have potential in that area for me because of the extra context they can add.  I also like individual place holders on my shelf for these particular movies.  But, that is all personal preference and many people out there will find this exactly the economical package they need.  I highly recommend it and would give it an unreserved 5 stars if it just had all the digital extras.",1400803200,48,2750,4.594262295081967
