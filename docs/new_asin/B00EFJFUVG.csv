5911525,5,B00EFJFUVG,"Such an adorable movie. The characters are cute, the story is quite fun and poignant at times, and the whole thing is just so funny and sweet. Rob Schneider is hilarious as Dodo the bird...and Josh Duhamel add the main character Ace has a sweet dignity and cuteness that melts your heart. Kids under 10 seem to all love it, and there's a cpl wonderful lessons in it as well, that parents will appreciate.
I would definitely get it for any kids I care about. And anyone who says it is a copy of Disney's Planes, is utterly wrong...because this movie was made first. So if one is a copy...well, it isn't this one :-)
It's a movie with heart, and character..and kids would be lucky to have it.",1390089600,2,690,4.3565891472868215
5911526,2,B00EFJFUVG,"This was a very bad knock off of planes. The animation is bad, the plot isn't any better.  Don't waste your time or money!!",1389398400,,123,4.125
5911527,1,B00EFJFUVG,"I don't care if this movie predated Planes.  People in the industry have known about Planes for years.  There would be no Wings w/o Planes and all the advance marketing to build up the buzz.  Don't fall for this cheap imitation. My 8 and 11 year-olds turned it off 20 minutes in. The plot and characters are flat, clichd and uninspiring.  If you don't mind showing your kids junk, you won't mind this movie. But if you have any respect for your kids' developing minds, you'll avoid this embarrassment.",1385337600,,501,4.595505617977528
5911528,5,B00EFJFUVG,"Lately my 2 year old son enjoys playing with trains and planes (replacing the usual cars), and he loves this movies.  He requests to watch it everyday.  We're certainly not movie critics or enthusiasts, but we enjoyed watching it, and for this reason alone it gets 5 stars.",1384646400,7,273,4.666666666666667
5911529,5,B00EFJFUVG,"My 3 year old son watches this movie over and over. So to me, this is a win!!  I am happy if he is happy.",1384041600,6,105,3.2
5911530,3,B00EFJFUVG,"ever since Wings came out a few months ago just about every website that talked about its release had TONS of people claiming that this movie was a rip-off of Planes and that it only came out to ride on the wave of popularity Planes had. well i'm here to set that rumor straight, cuz i've been a fan of this movie for a long time and know that rumor is not true.

Wings was originally a Russian movie called ""Ot Vinta 3D"", which came out in mid 2012 in Russia, PREDATING Disney's Planes by a year. i would recommend anybody who was a fan of Planes to watch this movie, as Disney took many different elements from this film and put them in Planes (the main character being afraid of heights being the most significant). so that being said, Wings could not possibly be a rip-off of Planes. Ot Vinta 3D was eventually released in Germany over the summer as ""Jets: Helden Der lufte"" and eventually in America as ""Wings"".

the plot is very similar to the first Cars movie, which attracted plenty of critics in Russia, Germany, and America alike, and the animation quality is obviously poorer than Disney's animation in Planes, which is to be expected as not many animation studios have the budget Disney has. so if you're looking for stunning animation, you probably won't find too much of it here. (the cover is also misleading on what the main character's face actually looks like; none of the characters have mouths that big, or convey expressions that dramatic)

Wings is significantly different than the original Russian version though; the entire soundtrack was changed, certian objects in the background like the clouds were changed, and (to my annoyance) the dialog in certian scenes was changed. all of this makes for what ends up being a slightly hard to watch movie for kids and adults alike. the original Russian version was full of emotion and depth, with the soundtrack and dialog all playing a role in that. however in Wings, with the change in soundtrack and dialog, the movie seems shallow and flat, despite the seriousness of certian situations the characters experience in the film.

so yeah, i would recommend this movie for parents of little children, Disney/Pixar fans, or just fans of the movie Planes (just to check out the movie that inspired a good chunk of the plot in Planes). however the original Russian version has no English subtitled version on youtube anymore (at one point in time there was, but it was taken down) if there was an English subtitled version out there though, i would recommend watching that instead of ""Wings"" XD",1380240000,25,2558,4.703125

5911973,3,B00EFJFUVG,"Not to be confused with the 1927 silent war film or long-standing unrelated sitcom series of the same name, Wings is the 2012 Russian CG animated film known as Jets for most of the world.  Perhaps the name change was due to the fact that given its uncanny similarity to the much more popular (and just better in general Disney franchise Planes), so similar a title encroached upon copyright infringement.  I suspect if theres one thing LionsGate would like to try to avoid in the situation, it would be Disneys legal department.  And while comparisons are inevitable, the inferior Wings isn't quite the train wreck (plane crash?) it could have been given the deplorable method of its domestic existence.

Wings, like countless other films in the direct-to-dvd CG film genre before it, is in fact a foreign film that receives a dubbed English vocal track, a new name and is pawned off as an original movie.  In the event that this is the first of my reviews youve encountered, let me just summarize years worth of complaining on the subject into a single sentence: Rarely does this technique work.  On its simplest level- there is the matter of matching mouth flaps of another language into English so that the whole piece doesnt resemble a Godzilla movie from the 1960s.  On its most complex, there is the issue of cultural difference and the timing of natural conversational flow.  More often than not, films created of this manner are forced to rely upon heavy exposition, narrators, subtext and all sorts of cheap-out techniques just to make sense.  Young viewers, of whom films of this nature are designed to appeal to first and foremost, are often most sensitive to the clumsiness of this practice and lose interest very quickly.

All of that being said, Wings is an at least watchable example of the technique.  Does that mean it can give Planes a run for its money?  Absolutely not.  However, when compared to some of the more painful examples of the practice out there (look into Legend of the Sea as an example of how wrong it can all go), this one is at least watchable if not enjoyable.

Wings tells the tale of Ace; a lowly fighter jet whos job is to apparently change the weather over some crop fields by disrupting the clouds above (yes, I realize they couldn't make him a crop duster for legal reasons mentioned above, but really?) who aspires to be a prestigious stunt jet.  A few weeks before a big airshow competition, Ace gets tricked into believing he was invited to take part in the competition.

Determined to be the next champion, Ace ventures out to find and train with the elusive Colonel, a legendary retired aircraft trainer.  Long story short Colonel reluctantly takes Ace under his wing (pun- too much?), Ace nearly quits along the way but is forced to dig in deep, a villain in the form of Cyclone tries to foil Aces ambition, the day of the competition comes and the true definition of a hero is discovered by all.  There is nothing new under the sun here, and in fact, when viewed back to back with Planes, perhaps Disney need fear a mole leaking animation info across the pond like some Cold War era spy; which, by the way, would have made for a much more interesting movie.

The piece comes in at a runtime of 88-minutes and wears a G rating.  Also like most foreign-turned-domestic CG efforts, this one manages to secure a pretty solid vocal cast for dub duties: Josh Duhamel as Ace, Hilary Duff as love interest Windy, Rob Schneider as the loyal but annoying chicken sidekick Dodo, Jesse McCartney as the villain Cyclone and Tom Skerritt as Colonel.

However, all the acting talent in the world cant save the film from its biggest downfall (yes theres one even bigger than the lack of originality here): a muddled plot.  In summary like above, it seems straight forward enough but the way the plot unfolds is very odd.  It almost feels as though there are pieces to the story missing; the ones necessary to justify the character motivations.  The plot is riddled full of happenstance and odd directorial choices.  Well suffer through 15-minutes of unnecessary dialog but the scene where Cyclone finally gets his come-uppings happens so insanely fast and nonchalant as to appear an afterthought.  So much for dramatic resolution.

Then, and this may be nit-picking, there is the little annoyance that manages to totally undo the brilliance of Pixars Cars/ Planes universe that may go unnoticed by younger viewers but was glaring to me:  The reason these films work is the lack of biologic lifeforms preset.  Were to suspend disbelief on account of the fact that everything in these worlds is anthropomorphic inanimate objects; a metaphor for society if somehow we weren't involved in any capacity.  Wings almost gets it right but then interlaces biological animals to the formula.  We have blackbirds, insects, chickens- that apparently can talk for whatever reason and speak to/ understand the vehicles.  A minor complaint, sure, but small questions start to surface before long- are there other talking animals in this world?  Are there people in this world?  Could these talking animals communicate with humans as well if so?  Just more sloppiness to make the experience a tad less enjoyable.

Finally I suppose I should mention the visuals as, surprisingly, they are by no means the weakest link to this chain.  The character models and textures are surprisingly solid.  In fact, there are moments (like when the farm vehicles wake a sleepy Ace) where its almost easy to forget you aren't in fact watching a Cars or Planes film.  The backgrounds definitely take a hit though when compared to the above examples and the mechanics of motion aren't nearly as precise.  Objects move far more stiffly throughout the frames- the concept of flight nowhere near as lifelike as the latter.  However, all in all, creating and animating objects as stiff and non-biologic as planes, cars and tractors is definitely a wise move on behalf of the smaller studios, as it takes a lot less detail work to look convincing as say an animal or human character.

In conclusion, unless you are a die-hard collector of film involving anthropomorphic vehicles or your little ones simply cant get enough of the stuff despite there being at present two Cars films, a series of Cars Toons, two Planes (with a third one on the way); Wings and its abysmal sequel (Wings: Sky Force Heroes) are probably best left to collect dust in the bargain bins.",1417132800,,6457,4.790613718411552
5911974,5,B00EFJFUVG,My son loves this movie. After the 3 time renting it from redbox I figured it was time to just buy it so when the price dropped I picked it up and have it hidden away until Christmas.,1416700800,2,183,3.8421052631578947
5911975,1,B00EFJFUVG,"I hate to speak ill of it because it comes from a company with good intentions producing family movies with good messages.  But the movie was just bad.  (And to the person who said it's not a Planes rip-off because there was another version of Wings out in 2012 obviously missed the fact that there is a Planes TRAILER in the Cars 2 DVD that came out in 2011...Sounds to me like the story line got leaked and someone snatched it up...The difference is Disney took the time to do it right...)

With that said, Disney's Planes has a GREAT message even if it's not put out by a ""faith based"" company.  It's a movie I had no problem with my 4 year old seeing (and I'm picky about movies-VERY picky).  And it's just a better movie than Wings.  Wings lacked excitement, adventure and a clear message... it would be hard for little ones to follow.  I don't get tired of watching Planes, but Wings bores me.

5911977,3,B00EFJFUVG,"The Movie is OK.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is due to the plot.  This could have been so much better but they made the plot a bit too complicated to hold the little ones attention.  My Grandson just loved Planes and Planes Fire and Rescue!  There was a lot of action in those movies to keep him glued to the screen.  He is only five and was able to sit through both those movies in a theater without getting distracted or losing interest.  This movie kept his attention for maybe 15 minutes and then he was off doing other things.  There just wasn't enough action packed scenes to keep his attention and the story line is really more adult oriented.  That being said, my Grandson is not your average 5 year old.  He was reading at age 3 and probably intelligence wise is a couple grades ahead so if he wasn't entertained then I can only assume this movie might be better suited for a younger person at the age of maybe 8 to 10 yrs and up.",1407283200,,946,4.153846153846154
