6472791,4,B00L6AW7CC,"This DVD makes a great companion to the book (available on Amazon), especially if you read the book first. Seeing the main characters of this true-life story come alive through archival footage really vitalizes the reader's/viewer's involvement with this bizarre and fascinating human adventure. The DVD alone, while excellently produced, can be confusing in the storyline, as there are interviews with people who really had little to do with the actual events depicted in Dore Strauch's original memoir. Basically many of the interviews are from the descendants of other colonists on other islands, and I suspect their experiences were quite different from those of the original settlers on the island of Floreana. Nonetheless, that portion of the video that does deal directly with the trials and tribulations of the Ritters, the Wittmers, and the ever-notorious ""Baroness"" captures the tension, anxieties and the hatreds that developed on this little island. All in all, a splendid cautionary tale about the dangers of seeking paradise here on earth.",1411603200,9,1053,5.387878787878788

6472794,5,B00L6AW7CC,"Ever since the late 1800s when Jules Verne began publishing his international best-sellers, the world has been fascinated by the idea of dramatically escaping from civilization. Flash forward to 2014 and a dozen popular TV series are fueled by that same desire. In late September, the National Geographic Channel will debut another one: Live Free or Die, a series that looks at Americans trying to survive in remote woods and swamps.

Now, Zeitgeist Films brings us one of the strangest true stories of escaping adventurers. This mixed bag of misfits converged on a remote island in the Galapagos chain between the two World Wars. Their tale is so wild that a writer for the Smithsonian Institution, reporting on the Smithsonians extensive archives about this strange adventure, described the story as a screwball farce peopled by eccentrics that abruptly turned to tragedy.

During the heyday of this Galapagos experiment, lurid magazines around the world published fanciful dispatches from this little colony with headlines that included: The Nudist Empress of the Galapagos and Mad Empress in the Garden of Eden and The Insatiable Baroness who Created Her Own Paradise.

As it turns out, the real pioneer in this paradise was a German doctor with a grandiose vision of his role as a philosopher and naturalist. He apparently was a very effective wilderness pioneer, building many hand-made devices to make his island home a pleasurable place to live. But he also was motivated by a selfishness that amounted to loathing other people. When an odd-ball mix of other adventurers showed up on this doctors remote island, trouble was all but certain.

The adventurer who was chiefly responsible for the islands global acclaim was a woman with even more grandiose visions than the doctor. She called herself a baroness (even though she wasnt) and very publicly set up a household with a rotating series of male lovers. She even began production on a silent film with herself starring as a savage, scantily clad pirate! Some footage of this bizarre movie is included in the documentary.

This new documentary was directed by Dayna Goldfine and Dan Geller, the folks who brought us the acclaimed documentary, Ballet Russes, which also dipped back into this pre-World War II era in its vivid portrait of the world-famous Russian troupe.

As a journalist, most of my career has focused on interreligious and cross-cultural issues. So, why am I reviewing this film? Because dreams of finding a remote paradise run throughout the long and tangled history of the worlds great religious movements, from some of the founding communities in what is now the United States (Remember the Pilgrims, the Puritans and the Shakers?) to tragic cults like Jim Jones Jonestown in Guyana where more than 900 people died in 1978.

Perhaps most fascinating about this cautionary tale from the Galapagos is that the German doctors master work of philosophy was ultimately of no interest to publishers in the civilized world and, instead, in 1935 his lover Dore Strauch published her own version of the island experiment, Satan Came to Eden: A Survivors Account of the Galapagos Affair.

This definitely is a mesmerizing two hours! Its also a good choice for sparking conversation in any small group that enjoys discussing either new films or global issues.",1410134400,10,3329,5.095412844036697
6472795,4,B00L6AW7CC,Quite clever material; and from real life too?  Somebody knew a cool story when they researched this one!  Well done changing sequences from modern day Galapagos residents (and sometimes generational survivors) to retelling the story preWWII.  History buffs will not have known this one!,1409702400,3,287,5.4772727272727275
6472824,4,B00L6AW7CC,"It is very interesting and includes old video and photo footage of the characters, Europeans settling in the Galapagos years ago, with a touch of scandal. Will be visiting there soon and trying to learn as much as possible about the area. Also, was pleased to be able to rent this

6472867,4,B00L6AW7CC,"Good documentary on a unique German Doctor and his girlfriend who escape civilization to build a isolated life in the wilds of the Galapagos Islands and their struggles and trials. The publicity and descriptions for this doc makes it sound like a 2 hour murder mystery, but its not. The disappearance of two of their hour long away neigbors doesnt come into play until the last 15 minutes or so of the film. And its not that hard to figure out what really happened. Still a good film though with footage actually taken by the Doctor.",1416614400,,533,4.5625

Now, it is kind of a shame that we don't have insider testimony from the weird S&M triangle centered around ""The Baroness"".  But nevertheless this is quite entertaining.  It plays like a dark comedy - ""you can't make this stuff up"".",1415059200,,382,4.7272727272727275

6472871,3,B00L6AW7CC,"I so loved the idea of this film better than I liked the actual film.  I just felt it dragged...a lot.  I did love the use of vintage images and film, but the voice overs with accents just got to be a little much, and even confusing at times as to whom exactly was speaking.  And a lot of the film felt superfluous, especially at a 2 hour length.",1412640000,2,346,3.9855072463768115

8664009,5,B00L6AW7CC,"An excellent documentary.  It is true that paradise is not a place but a condition, and that wherever you go you still take yourself with you -- so if you are the problem, then there is no place you can go to get a fresh start (as Dr. Ritter almost certainly discovered).  The story of these individuals who sought to abandon civilization and create their own 'paradise' is thought-provoking on so so many levels.",1500595200,2,413,4.5675675675675675
8664010,3,B00L6AW7CC,"Seemingly no adult in this story has clean hands. Self-centered fools displaying the worst in human nature. 'Paradise' indeed looks more like hell. Still, an interesting,bizarre story and well made.  3.5 / 5",1498694400,,207,5.2727272727272725

8664016,5,B00L6AW7CC,"This is the best Doc. I have ever seen in my life. I have been watching at least 2-3 new Doc's a month, for the last 30 years. I'm the worst critic, easily bored and I must tell you, I can't stop thinking about all the unanswered questions and mysterious situations that still remain today.  The original footage just blew my mind. I'm having a private showing/party at my home, we will all dress as the characters, and dine on boiled chicken and exploding pig BBQ, downing tropical cocktails. LOL ! My husband is a dentist and I'm begging him to (make me a crude metal teeth partial ) for the party! Everyone of my friends will get the Doc. & book for Holiday gifts this year...via Amazon.
I did not buy this Doc. On Amazon, I purchased from a Film Channel, but did buy a few of the books. Advise- see the Doc first then read the books...that is the only way to get the ""full effect"". Hats off to the film makers, once again you have created a masterpiece. I have been a fan for awhile...but this is your crowing glory!",1467331200,,1020,4.284974093264249
