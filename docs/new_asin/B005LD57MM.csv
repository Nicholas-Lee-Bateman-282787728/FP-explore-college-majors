And none of the scenes in this film, as lovely as they are, achieve the power of similar scenes in earlier Angelopoulos films, partly due to the lack in other areas, but mostly due to the anomy this film inhabits and inflicts in its viewers. Cinematographer Andreas Sinanos does his usual good work, and the film is radiant, in its 1.85:1 aspect ration, but the best part of the film is the scoring by Eleni Karaindrou, which is unfortunately never put to the best possible use, due to the visuals that Angelopoulos and editors Yannis Tsitsopoulos and Giorgos Chelidonides pair it with. Also, this film has substantially more shorter takes than most of Angelopoulos's canon, and far fewer longer ones. The script, by Angelopoulos, with some help, apparently, from Tonino Guerra and Petros Markaris, is not up to the usual standards of these men. The DVD, by Artificial Eye, has no extra features, and is in a Region 2 format, so North American viewers will need a codeless DVD player. Languages used are English, Russian, German, and Greek, with subtitling, as necessary.

  Overall, The Dust Of Time has glimpses of what made Theo Angelopoulos one of the all time greats of cinema, but not enough to make this merely solid, but frustrating, film, great. It is not a bad film, like the later films of other cinematic greats like Ingmar Bergman (Saraband) nor Federico Fellini (Intervista), but it definitely is an `old master's film,' in the worst possible, and most self indulgent ways. Still, for its moments and its technical skills, it should be seen. More importantly, though, it should have been better. Much better.",1340236800,,2078,4.847887323943662
8478078,4,B005LD57MM,"Three pillars of the European auteur scene, Bruno Ganz, Michel Piccoli and Irne Jacob, and Willem Dafoe as the Filmmaker. Using the ""Film within the Film"" gimmick, Theo Angelopoulos leads us to Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Moscow and the Siberian goulag in order to to tell us the second part of Spyros and Eleni's story. It could have been boring or didactic, it's not. Some frames of The Dust of Time are simply arresting. Imagine the beauty of a scene filmed by Werner Herzog but without an ecstatic music or an hypnotic rhythm. Just the Beauty. Imagine. Note that you can find a zone 2 DVD at Amazon.co.uk released by Artificial Eye. Highly recommended.",1327968000,,650,4.761061946902655
