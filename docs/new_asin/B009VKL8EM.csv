family oriented...................a close group.  It is nice to see a clean cut band.",1361491200,,204,6.285714285714286
5369109,5,B009VKL8EM,The energy and the fun this group has while performing comes through loud and clear in this DVD.  One of the best concert discs I have ever seen!,1361145600,,145,4.178571428571429
5369110,5,B009VKL8EM,"The day I received the Mumford & Sons Road to Red Rocks DVD, we were rearranging my house which included setting up all the electronics in the house.  I thought we would never finish, and this DVD was my encouragement not to toss in the towel.  Finally, once everything was hooked up, instead of cooking dinner, well, you guessed it.  Better than any meal in a five star restaurant!!! M & S have given substance, intelligence and pure entertainment back to the world of music--a pure joy to watch and listen to.  And what a venue for their first DVD release!!!  There is just something about Red Rocks that does seem to literally not only bring the best performers but also bring out the very best from those performers.  Practically every day I have to have a ""fix"" and watch at least some of the performance.  My husband even chides me, asking, ""Which is your favorite song today?"".  There literally is not a ho hum performance of any song on the DVD.  Not enough thumbs but highly recommend this DVD.  If you are not familiar with M & S this will be a great intro.  And if you are already a fan, you will not be disappointed!",1360540800,3,1128,4.400966183574879
5369111,4,B009VKL8EM,Mumford and Sons puts on an amazing show.  They were able to capture the essence of their music in this DVD.  Red Rocks was the perfect venue for this show!,1360281600,,156,4.166666666666667
5369112,5,B009VKL8EM,"Attention Mumford and Sons Fans!
So... I was in the market for a good blue ray disc that had some of my favorite music to play through my home theater system. My mission was to find a very good sounding high definition performance disc that could make sound system and tv shine. I searched far and wide to find either music videos or great concerts in High Definition picture and sound but it was very hard to find!

I was so happy to see this performance on Showtime one day. I liked it so much I bought the disc.

What a great sounding blu ray. If you even remotely like mumford and sons this is a must have.

This blu ray shows you really short clips of Mumford and Sons road trip and a couple very brief interviews while going back to the live performances at Red Rocks in Colorado.

This dvd is mostly them performing these songs listed below live. In my idea, this is a must own if you enjoy there music!

I only wish that there was a part 2

Great songs great quality live performances
They sound as great live as on cd.

They perform
Lovers eyes
Little lion man
Below my feet
Roll away your stone
Lover if the light
Thistle and weeds
Ghosts that we knew
Awake my soul
Whispers in the dark
Dust bowl dance
I will wait
The cave

Stick to studio recordings and pouring everything into it. By the way hire someone to write your set lists ..horrible layout of song sequence. My resume for my opinion? Over 375 shoes in 22 years and a collection of over 125 set lists for bands...three i created for the shows of some headline bands and they loved the sets and show. The ebb and flow of a show is so important.",1416873600,,544,4.281553398058253

5369166,5,B009VKL8EM,"Some how I had never heard of Mumford & Sons. Then I see on the local news that they just played the Monterey Fairgrounds, 5 miles from me. I check them out on Amazon and really enjoy their music.  Started collecting their music, then I saw this video on TV and realized that Monterey was part of the road.  How great is this band??  They get classified as Americana and they are British, is the invasion coming again. It seems they gave their all to Red Rocks and the crowd loved it. Kick myself for missing them in Monterey.
You will love this DVD, can't say anymore.",1398729600,,569,4.299065420560748

5369169,5,B009VKL8EM,"I fell in love with Mumford and Sons after watching The Road to Red Rocks on PBS several years ago.  I bought the CD, and I often thought I wish I could have been there.  Last year, they came to Oak Mountain in Pelham, Alabama.  I didn't get to Red Rocks, but I did get to Pelham.  They are a unique group of mates who have made some of the most original music I've ever heard.  I'm glad their road led them closer to my home.",1394841600,,426,3.9069767441860463

5369171,3,B009VKL8EM,"This show was a great show for Mumford in Sons.  An extrememly distracting trend in concert videos is a producer/director who switches camera angles too quickly.  this ends up being a VERY big distractor from the experience.  Take a hint from ""The Last Waltz"" where there is patience by Martin Scorcese with the performers.  In this Mumford video, the director feels that by switching angles quickly, especially as the tempo of the music picks up, he is adding to the performance.  He isn't.  If anything he is taking away from the experience.  Let our eyes move to the performers and sit the camera back.  What happens is just when we are settling in to watching an angle, it is switched!  Then as the tempo quickens it shifts every 3 seconds and almost throws you into a seizure.

For others out there who are realizing this, this video isn't the worst out there but pretty bad.  Unfortunately mumford picked the wrong director for this.  Hopefully the director learns how disctracting this is",1392768000,6,995,4.754385964912281

5369191,5,B009VKL8EM,"This film is amazing!

I am not going to lie... at first, I wasn't a very big fan of Mumford & Sons. I bought the first album and thought it was decent but nothing I would want to spend money to witness in person. Then one night as I was flipping through movie channels, this film was scheduled to play at 2 a.m. and I couldn't stay up to check it out, so I went ahead and set my DVR to record it so I could watch it the next day. After watching them perform live, I gained a whole new respect for them. After watching the DVR movie channel version about 10 or more times, I realized that I had to purchase this film for myself!

Not only does the film look & sound better than the DVR recording I had originally watched, it also had more songs than the movie channel version had shown! There's something great about watching this band live as opposed to listening to an album. To me, it is what makes them go from a decent band to a great band! This film is a MUST for all Mumford & Sons fans!",1380844800,,994,4.015151515151516

5369194,5,B009VKL8EM,"The energy and driving beat of Mumford and Sons is compelling, and the pensive lyrics are a beautiful counterpoint to it.  I enjoy the music, but seeing them singing is even better.  How did they come up with the combination of British working class harmonies, bluegrass, and rock?

5369213,5,B009VKL8EM,"This DVD was exceptional. It could be partially because Mumford and Sons is so awesome to begin with, but the video has clips of the road trip including fun, candid interactions with the group that really give a glimpse of who they are. Red Rocks is the most incredible venue as well..icing on the cake",1368057600,,302,4.509090909090909

5369223,5,B009VKL8EM,"Watching these four musical modern day poets (plus an ensemble of other musicians) on a television obviously falls short of actually watching them live but I must say I got exactly out of this film what I had hoped for.

These guys are absolutely electric on stage, the production quality is great, I love getting a taste of how these guys operate off stage, and let's not forget what an absolutely magnificent venue this must have been to play at. Beautiful live set all around and I know you'd all enjoy this as much as I did.

This is a must see for everyone!

The music coverage is simply great, but I wished it had given a little more background on the band's experiences and all the people they met while over here in the U.S.

5369231,5,B009VKL8EM,I was lucky enough to be at Red Rocks for this concert.  It was a very memorable experience and this video is as close to being there as you can get without having been one of the fortunates who was there.,1363737600,,205,4.0
5369232,5,B009VKL8EM,"All thier hits from the first two albums with minimal and undistracting interviews.  The cinemaphotoghrapy of the band, the venue, and the involved audience all add value to the CD listening experience.",1363737600,,202,5.3125

5369234,5,B009VKL8EM,"The title says it all. This film is a nice glimpse into the touring style of the band, although I can't say that watching this equates to seeing Mumford and Sons play live. Their musical brilliance definitely does shine through in ""Road to Red Rocks.""",1363564800,,251,4.6

5369243,5,B009VKL8EM,"I think I saw a version of this concert recently on Showtime but I watched it again, this time on a beautifully presented Blu ray disc, complete with a stellar DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track.  It is amazingly good, both in terms of a natural surround sound coming from the Red Rocks venue as well as the great songs performed by the band.  The video as well is excellent.  The great colors of the Colorado countryside are well displayed in full 16:9 aspect ratio.  There are no extras on the disc.  Numerous language sub-titles are available as well as Dolby Surround 5.1 and a PCM stereo track.

One of my biggest complaints of music concert films is the jerky quick-cut editing.  While some of that is present here it is less noticeable than most concert videos.  The 88 minute film, shot over 2 nights in the summer of 2012, intercuts several short segments of the band appearing in less well known venues such as Portland...Maine.  These only last a couple minutes each and are not terribly distracting.  Certainly less so than the long winded gibberish some performers exude.

As far as the music, the band is certainly at its joyful, playful best.  The 4 primary band members are joined by others during the concert, depending on the song.  The band Dawes comes out on ""Wake My Soul.""  The music is great.  Always well written songs from this group who is about as popular as any band on the planet right now.  Why?  The band seems to transcend genres, cultures and generations.  I've been listening to a lot of Eagles music lately.  I think one of the reason their music remains popular is great song writing and angelic harmonies.  The same can be said of Mumford and Sons.  I suspect they will be around a long time.",1362355200,21,1730,4.570032573289902
5369244,5,B009VKL8EM,"Coming from someone who has never seen Mumford & Sons live, I love this DVD.  It is mostly of their performance, with a little background video and sound clips.  And since this is a band that actually has talent, you can't go wrong.  I have heard the songs that are played a thousands times each, but watching these guys perform them is a whole new experience.  I will not be happy until I see them live, now.

Songs performed:
-Lovers' Eyes
-Little Lion Man
-Below My Feet
-Roll Away Your Stone
-Lover of the Light
-Thistle & Weeds
-Ghosts That We Knew
-Awake My Soul
-Whispers In the Dark
-Dust Bowl Dance

5369245,5,B009VKL8EM,"Great video - lots of energy & captures the essence of the band. The music was the best part of the video, but the other background content didn't take away from it. Quality was excellent and it was absolutely worth the cost.",1362009600,,225,4.380952380952381
5369246,4,B009VKL8EM,"Overall, a fantastic production. I would love it more if I could watch it with/without commentary. Generally, I tolerate commentary once...conversations once...radio intros once...but the songs I would be happy to listen to over and over and over. As is, the chit chat is minimal but still noticeable. The performance is premium and this is a must have for fans of Mumford and Sons. There is some typical band talk that you wouldn't find on a CD, so you won't be using this to put your kids to sleep. It's good to enjoy in the background while your cooking or relaxing with friends though.",1361750400,,589,4.673076923076923
