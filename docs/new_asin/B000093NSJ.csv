7988966,4,B000093NSJ,"It was only $4.99.  This movie was extremely weird.  It strangely reminded me of John Lennon's movie ""How I Won the War.""  The Nazi Otto Meissner ( i.e. a patient/doctor who thought he was Otto Meisner ) was portrayed as homosexual in this movie which I am pretty sure he was not.",1395878400,,280,4.346153846153846

7988968,4,B000093NSJ,"""Snide and Prejudice"" falls into a difficult movie category: dark, satiric comedy -- but some people may find its subject matter more disturbing than funny. This unsettling film may remind you of a satirical comedy like ""Dr. Strangelove"".... although ""Snide and Prejudice"" is far stranger, or at least strange in a different way, than that Stanley Kubrick classic.
In addition to the movie, the DVD contains a good assortment of special features. Don't miss the ""director's commentary"" audio track in which director Phillipe Mora discusses the film with the characters of Cohen and Michael/Hitler, with Auberjonois and MacFayden recreating their roles -- the resulting conversation is fascinating and very, very funny!
If you are interested in an unusual movie experience, I recommend ""Snide and Prejudice."" It may upset you, and it may make you laugh -- and it also may make you think.",1063238400,5,886,5.2027972027972025
