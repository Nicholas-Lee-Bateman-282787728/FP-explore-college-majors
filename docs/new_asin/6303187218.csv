600775,3,6303187218,"Indeed, it is a predictable premise...only instead of the psychotic ex lover, it's the psychotic soon to be ex-wife...out to get ""her family"" back.
Jamie Lee Curtis is chillingly convincing as Jude, the maniac woman who left her family three years previous.  Now she's back, and she'll do anything to keep her family.
This is probably the only movie of Jamie's besides True Lies that I like - she does psychopath extremely well.
The other adult characters in the movie, with the exception of Jude's mother, (played by Vanessa Redgrave, with a pretty good resemblance to Jamie btw...) are imbeciles, but Jamie makes it all worth while.  She's that good...she's sick, and she convinced me-- whether she's trying to molest her 12 year old son or get the family dog run over by a car, she's got what it takes to make us believe it and make us all want her dead.
Peter Gallagher was better in While You Were Sleeping - at least he was supposed to be comatose there.
It's a little cheezy, it's kind of cliche, it's fairly pretictable - but it isn't a total waste.  And be sure to let the closing credits play - the theme song, ""The Longest Night"" is beautifully haunting and will make your hair stand up.",1088985600,4,1198,4.562790697674418
600776,5,6303187218,"Jamie Lee Curtis is a much better actress than most people have ever realized.  Typically cast as the terrified young ingenue who could really screen, e.g., HALLOWEEN, Curtis takes a turn as the woman from hell in this underrated chiller.  She joins a list of notables in this genre:  Jessica Walter in PLAY MISTY FOR ME; Patsy Kensit in HELL'S GATE; Kathleen Turner in BODY HEAT; Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION; Rebecca DeMornay in HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, to name just a few.  And Jamie's right up there with them.
Jamie plays a mother who abandons her family twice, once for 3 months and then for three years.  All of a sudden, she's back and she wants her family.  However, hubby Peter Gallagher has fallen in love with assistant principal Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and is going to divorce Jamie Lee.  Jamie's mama, played low key and convincingly by the still lovely Vanessa Redgrave, also thinks the divorce is for the best, harboring a surprising secret to justify this.  Of course, Jamie does everything within her power to get hubby and boys back, including poisoning the oldest son's (Luke Edwards, an excellent performance) feelings towards his new mother.
There are some disturbing scenes involving incestuous overtones between Curtis and Edwards that are handled tastefully, and there are three scenes that will pull you out of your chairs!
Curtis exudes a sensuality and evil never seen in her prior to this.  With ""Freaky Friday"" and memories of this gem, Curtis will someday get the Oscar and praise she deserves!",1074816000,13,1529,4.918287937743191
600777,3,6303187218,"What's this? Jamie Lee Curtis is the bad guy, not the victim? Yes, she really can act (not just scream). This movie can be summed up in one word: predictable. If you've ever seen Fatal Attraction, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, or any other film of that ilk, then you've pretty much seen this one, too. Still, it's worth watching, if for no other reason than to see Jamie Lee in the role of the psychopathic killer.",1031011200,,416,4.346153846153846
600778,4,6303187218,"Apparently this was one of those movies for which there was not a big publicity budget. Too bad, because Jamie Lee Curtis' acting stands out, and as a big fan of her, I admit she also looks gorgeous!
 The suspense type of movie. Very good for a weekend...",998179200,,255,4.3125
600779,4,6303187218,This is an OK thriller.  The shortcomings in the script are compensated for by Gallager and Jamie Lee Curtis. I have never seen Jamie look so sexy and so evil.  She is quite convincing as is Peter Gallager.  The actress that plays his wife is awful and is as one-dimensional and phony as a paper doll.  The weird sexual tension in the bathtub scene has burned a image of Jamie Lee's wet buttocks in my mind.  Get the DVD just for that.,972172800,3,435,4.2560975609756095

600896,5,6303187218,This was a film that I viewed when it first came out many years ago but could not find to buy until just recently.  I really liked all of the actors and the storyline is both fascinating and frightening.  It showed how much a mother can be manipulative for her own purposes. I do not want to give away anymore.,1405382400,,310,4.15
600897,4,6303187218,"Jamie Lee who usually plays the ""good"" girl part is fabulous in this ""bad"" girl role.  Some parts are predictable, but still an entertaining flick. She leaves her husband and sons for a few years and then comes back hoping to pick back up where she left off. Her husband is in a relationship with someone else and boy is she upset about it. She torments the woman and develops a strange relationship with her oldest son and tries to turn him against dad's girlfriend which works for a while. The kid sees her for what she really is...a little on the wacko side, and in the end goes against her.  All in all, pretty good.",1398643200,,620,4.336206896551724

JAMIE LEE STARTED IN 1978 IN HALLOWEEN, WHICH TO ME IS THE BEST  OR 2ND BEST HORROR FILM. HER MOTHER PLAYED I N THE OTHER BEST HORROR MOVIE PSYCHO. I WAS VERY SURPRISED  SHE COULD PLAY A PSYCHO PATH.

She wants her family back, but even her own mother thinks that's a bad idea. Chaos ensues then on out.

600972,5,6303187218,THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE WITH JAMIE LEE CURTIS I LOVED THE INTRIGUE AND THE SUSPENSE. JAMIE LEE IS AT HER BEST AGAIN.,1362182400,,125,4.25
600973,5,6303187218,"I first laid eyes on this movie in the movie SCREAM...the poster is seen in the background of the video store sequence. However, I did not notice this until I saw this DVD in a video store in the horror section. On the cover it stated, ""The FATAL ATTRACTION of the 90's!""...that alone got me hooked, as I am a huge fan of Fatal Attraction.

Jamie Lee Curtis in full throttle sexy mode plays Jude, a sosiopathic mother who left her husband Robert (played by Peter Gallagher) and her three children three years ago. Now with Colleen (played by Joanne Whalley) as the new mother figure of the family, Robert files for divorce from Jude. Jude suddenly returns and will do ANYTHING to win her family back.

There is something extremely hot about Jamie Lee Curtis being a sociopath. I really cannot figure out why the film recieved such poor ratings because this was truthfuly one of the most satisfying viewing experiences I have ever had. Packed with suspense, a great story, and a literally Cliff-Hanging climax, MOTHER'S BOYS is a film that will not disappoint.",1361318400,3,1059,4.688172043010753
600974,5,6303187218,"I loved this movie!  It keeps you in suspense the whole duration of the movie.

600976,4,6303187218,"My son recently bought this movie and we saw it as a family.  All three of us liked it a lot and I'm happy to see that the majority of reviewers here also like the movie.  Apparently at the time there was a lot of negativity surrounding it.  On IMDB, it looks like people either liked it or hated it.  One reason some give for its lack of box office draw was that the genre of deadly triangles had gotten saturated at the time.

We found it gripping, essentially well acted, particularly Ms. Curtis.  Her performance is beautifully nuanced.  At the beginning she seems quite a normal person, but gradually it dawns that this is one unhinged woman.  A tic here, a momentary curl of the lip, a deadening of the eyes lead to the revelation of her sociopathic reality.  She does have some ""rug chewing"" scenes, but these come out of a realized characterization and are not gratuitous.

The other acting ranges from competent to quite good.  Mr Gallagher is rather bland and lacked spark, I thought.  Joanne Whalley fits her role quite well, as does Lynn Redgrave.  The boys are good.  One major quibble I have is Luke Edwards' Kes.  He was turned to Jamie's side too quickly, I thought, and strained credulity.  Also, I thought his character too important to have only the sketch in character he was given.  I may be that this was one movie that was a little under written rather than over written.  Jamie's Jude is the antagonist here, but Kes is really the protagonist and I think his character needed more development.",1325203200,2,1517,4.555555555555555

600979,5,6303187218,"Jamie Lee Curtis stars as a wife and mother of three boys who suddenly abandoned them. When her family is just getting over her, and her husband engaged, here she comes again, wanting her family back. Sexual advances toward her husband don't work, so she tries to win her boys back by preying on the oldest by letting him drive (he's 12), appearing nude in front of him, and as with all three kids letting them call her by her first name (a very cool ""Jude""). She wins them over long enough to remind them of a game they used to play. But this version's a killer and its victim is her husband's fiancee (JoAnn Whalley).

Vanessa Redgrave gives a fine performance as Jude's mother, who would rather see JoAnn Whalley win this battle over the family.  (I have also seen this movie under the title ""Mother's Boys"".)",1255910400,2,812,4.47972972972973
600980,4,6303187218,"MOTHER'S BOYS allows Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween 1 and 2, The Fog, Terror Train, Prom Night) to be the bad girl for a change (although she was semi-bad / good in Trading Places). Ms. Curtis jumps into her role as Jude, a crazed, sociopathic mum determined to take her family back. Of course, the fact that she deserted her husband and sons for 3 years is immaterial to her. Jude must have them at any cost, even if it means bumping off hubby's new girlfriend! This sets up some nice insane behavior for Jamie Lee to sink her beautiful teeth into. MOTHER'S BOYS is a fairly tense, nearly bloodless movie. The fun comes from watching the Jude character grow increasingly reckless, dangerous, and downright lethal. Oh yeah, she does flash a boobular as well, if you're into that. My goodness she is well put together! Beware the loose-fitting robe and bubble-bath sequences!...",1238025600,,874,4.756578947368421

601002,5,6303187218,"Curtis does a fantastic job playing the bad guy in ""Mothers Boys."" The ending is a cliff hanger,and just when you think the movies ended,your in for a scary suprise.

601003,3,6303187218,"Mother's Boys was a so-so suspense movie.  It felt like one of those ""made for TV"" movies.  You know, the kind that's forced to lack the serious suspense and special kind of extreme violence in order to avoid aggravating all the sensitive people who are easily offended by such things.

It's about a mother who disappears for a while and returns one day and demands to see her children and start a family again.  She's totally insane though, and wouldn't mind killing or doing evil things just to get her way.

Throughout the movie, the story builds between her and her oldest son, and the friendship between the two develops more and more until she's finally able to convince her son that she's the one who's normal, while everyone else is wrong.

She comes up with this amazing plan in the end that involves her oldest son killing his father's girlfriend, only for it to come back and bite her on the behind.

I won't spoil the ending, but it's the best part of the movie, and honestly, it wasn't even that great.",1209340800,,1015,4.5136612021857925
601004,3,6303187218,"Obviously, any mother who abandons her family for 3 years and then returns out of nowhere to reclaim her sons has deep psychological problems. Curtis does a splendid job in her role as the deeply disturbed, perhaps satanic parent who eventually reaches out too far,and suffers the ultimate fall. Whalley is nearly as effective as the school vice principal,turned lover, turned family protector, whose heroic efforts save the aforementioned boys. But, where is Gallagher? While all hell is breaking out around him, he seems to be more interested in an architectural project, going shopping, meeting with his wimpy lawyer, being in the wrong place at the wrong time,(buying a Big Mac)? Whalley wants to marry this nincompoop? Additionally, the movie's background music seems to imply satanic involvement,as do nightmares, flashbacks, sharp sounds;but not totally convincingly to this reviewer. The pacing is spasmodic, and Curtis' miraculous recovery from  a self inflicted forehead slashing must have made A.M.A. history. Sorry, even though somewhat entertaining,this picture fails to live up to ""thrillers""past.",1200960000,2,1111,5.57396449704142

601008,5,6303187218,Jamie Lee Curtis and Peter Gallagher are excellent in this forgotten thriller about a divorced mother and father who fight over the right to see their two boys.  Jamie Lee Curtis plays the mother who comes back into the boys lives after three yrs away and tries to get them back and destroy her exhusbands new life with his girlfriend.  Jamie Lee is pretty good at being crazy in this flick and it is surely one of her best acting roles.  The movie has numerous chilling momments that are brillantly filmed.

601009,4,6303187218,"The story line in the movie itself is a little bit disturbing, and reminded me very much of ""Single White Female"". The plot is pretty simple (ok, paper thin)- but don't watch it for that; if you're like me (a Jamie Lee Curtis Fan - yes, I confess) this was kind of fun to watch.  Her other film roles have generally been of her as a fairly squeaky clean, wholesome person or as a victim. But in ""Mother's Boys"", she really goes the other way (to the dark side that is).  And she looks great, and is very sexy in this role - especially when it comes to showing those great legs she has, which she inherited from her mother (Janet Leigh). It also reminded me of ""A Fish Called Wanda"", where she REALLY showed those great legs.

Any way watch and enjoy!",1142467200,9,750,4.230769230769231

Jude Madigan abandons her three sons and husband Robert.  After three years away, she finally has decided that home is where the heart is and she wants her family back.  Life comes at her fast as she finds out Robert has moved on with a young assistant principal named Callie and ready to wed.  Robert isn't thrilled to see his ex nor is their oldest son Kes.  Kes early holds deep resentment with Jude leaving their family abruptly as a young boy.  Robert is willing to fight Jude to have full custody of their children but Jude is willing to try every trick in the book to get her family back even if it means she has to get her hands dirty.

The movie is a good popcorn flick when you want some guilty pleasure entertainment.  Plus if you liked ""Kramer vs Kramer"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,""  you might feel quickly draw into the plot.
