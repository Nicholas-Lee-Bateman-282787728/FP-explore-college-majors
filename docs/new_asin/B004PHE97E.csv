4444386,3,B004PHE97E,"This movie is not too bad, but not great either. Reminded me a little of ""Endless Summer"".
The ""Blue Crush 2"" name must have been purchased for its recognition value, because there is absolutely no continuity in plot or characters from ""Blue Crush"".",1310601600,2,249,4.813953488372093
4444387,5,B004PHE97E,"I haven't gotten to watch the movie yet, but they said it was good.  The packaging was great and it got here on time.  Thank you!",1310342400,,129,3.923076923076923
4444388,5,B004PHE97E,"At first I was a bit skeptical when I noticed that this film went straight to video and not released in theatres. Then I saw the trailer on YouTube and just viewing that short preview I could see this was a quality film so I bought it and it's a keeper. There are a few short subplots in the movie but the main story line is Dana's quest to find herself, surf the best swells at the places her mother was at 20 years before and making new friends with the large surfing group she meets. Traveling around South Africa was a joy to watch as it was filmed entirely on location there. A truly uplifting gem of a film for young and old alike and I highly recommend it.",1309046400,12,663,4.107692307692307
4444389,5,B004PHE97E,"Ok this was a straight to dvd sequel which means expectations are to be at the bare minimum. Was the acting bad? Sure. But who are we kidding, the acting in the first one wasn't much better. This movie, much like fast and the furious and others that clearly aren't meant to present great talented actors, was just meant for fun, and it did its job. Plenty of surfing scenes and semi-likeable characters made this a nice way to kill time while winding down at the end of a work day. I would rent before purchasing, but at least give it that much of a chance.",1308268800,17,557,4.264150943396227
4444390,1,B004PHE97E,"I have been looking forward to this movie release for months.  I loved the first blue crush, and knew that this was not a sequel by any means, but I was severely disappointed with it.  The acting was horrible, the script was poorly written, the editing was choppy, and there are even a couple scenes where you could tell they were in front of a green screen.  Pretty sure the budget on this movie was 2 cokes and a candy bar.  If Justin Beiber, and Rebecca Black collaborated on a movie together, Blue Crush 2 would be their love child.",1307491200,7,536,4.33
4444391,4,B004PHE97E,"This is a real feel good movie,something the whole family can enjoy. The movie itself has nothing to do with the original Blue Crush,with the exceptions of the title and surfing. The movie revolves around Dana who leaves California and heads to South Africa to fulfill her mother's dream of surfing J-Bay. The production and acting exceed what you would expect from a direct to dvd release. Even though it is a bit cliche,i will again suggest this for a good family nite movie.",1307232000,14,477,4.690476190476191

4444410,3,B004PHE97E,"3 stars because the disk still works. The plastic case has no locks, they were damaged by someone and then removed from the package. The disks inside the case look like were used: the spots on the surface, light scratches, etc. It was removable, although the impression it made was really bad. I paid for a new product. The case itself was damaged, the latches were broken and then removed, they are not even inside the case. So I need to invent something like a tape or a rubber around the case  since the cases opens up being placed on the shelf.

I think I have missed the positive things about this movie. The movie itself is incredible! The way it was filmed exceeds all expectations, the waves are real and the way it's done is awesome!",1428278400,,742,4.408759124087592

4444421,5,B004PHE97E,"Long story short. I love this Blue Crush 2 movie. I haven't seen the original. Watching girls surfing is very hot.

This is truly high definition in 1080p with dts HD mst audio.

I get to see the beautiful sides of Africa. With more waves. Alot of African dance music, and last and not least, the sexy and beautiful Sasha Jackson. She is mighty fine!!!

They should revive Baywatch and have her be a big star actress. I want a girl that looks like her.

Love it or hate it. I absolutely love this movie. I love it because it has natural life ourdoors, from Giraffes, Elephants, waves of Indian Ocean. Explore the outdoors. I like how the way actress Sasha portrays the American accent. A local Beverly hills girl. Trying to find out the roots of her lost mother who passed away when she was 5. Her dad was a very busy business man. Who earns alot of money to support him and his daughter. Sending her to an exclusive private school.

I believe actress Sasha. I forgot her character name. I only saw it once I have thee blu ray. I got to see it again. She ran away from home to venture south Africa. She made new friends there. And father followed her in the end. She accomplished surfing those extremely high waves and doing the 360 spin. And tossing her mothers ashes free in the ocean.

End credits, most of actors and actresses were walking down the beach in surboards.",1408492800,,1372,4.381889763779528
4444422,3,B004PHE97E,"This movie surprised me.  I thought it was going to be a boring 2nd part, but it wasn't.  It was pretty good.  This part had a different setting and characters.  If you liked the first part, you may want to give this one a chance.  It wasn't too bad.",1406332800,,250,4.020408163265306
4444423,4,B004PHE97E,"Great story? Meh. It's decent, but not amazing. However, when you just need a fun movie to watch about surfing, who cares?  :) The inner traveller / adventurer in me was happy to see beautiful locations, a throw - your - stuff - down - and - camp environment, and some fun, beautiful shots of surfing. Go ahead and buy it; sometimes you just need to chill with some light entertainment.",1388966400,4,386,4.436619718309859
4444424,3,B004PHE97E,"I really like most movies, easy to entertain I don't tend to over think movies and just enjoy them for what they are. I was a HUGE fan of the original Blue Crush. I knew this one being a sequel would likely not stand up to its original but thought it would be worth the watch for a light heart good feel movie. And its was, OK. It was lacking, the story was ok, the acting was meh. Visually it was really beautiful, makes u wanna go to the beach. Its not a movie I have ever re watched, with no plans to either.",1384041600,,511,3.923076923076923

The only problem I had was shipping took 4EVER..... The movie is where the blonde travels and surfs every wave her mother surfed, her mother is deceased. she lives with her father. sneaks out, travels makes friends.. GREAT SHOW...

4444428,5,B004PHE97E,"i haven't gotten to watch this movie yet but according to the reviews of others who own it say it's way better than the first movie. especially the music and the amount of surfing action in it. but i also have to say, ''watch out for sharks'' to dana as a charachter !

4444429,3,B004PHE97E,"Its terrible. The title implies that it is some extension of Blue Crush. It has nothing to do with Blue Crush and it wouldn't have been as bad if it hadn't ripped off the title. If they had called it something else, my expectations would not have been so high and I would have given it another star. Blue Crush was a really good movie. I have spent my life surfing. I have surfed everywhere except Australia. I can speak from experience ,everything about  Blue Crush is believable. Blue Crush Two is just the opposite.  It borders on corn ball. Save your money and spend it on your honey.",1354838400,,588,4.385321100917431
4444430,4,B004PHE97E,We have traveled to the Eastern Cape of South Africa and love the beauty and the people . We enjoyed seeing the Indian Ocean shown in all it's beauty in the movie. The plot is good also.,1352160000,,186,4.054054054054054
4444431,4,B004PHE97E,"I saw this sequel first while streaming movies on Netflix.  I wasn't expecting much but I do enjoy films about being on the beach with beautiful girls, because it reminds me on my Air Force days in Hawaii.

However, this film was done on the southern shore of South Africa, and Sasha Jackson who played Dana and Elizabeth Mathis who played Pushy really brought some unfamiliar beauty to the screen, even more appealing to me than the girls of the first film of ""Blue Crush.""

The first ""Blue Crush"" film had the now rather familiar Michelle Rodriguez, and though she is attractive, I liked her better when she got older and a bit more mature.  I loved her role in ""Machete.""

Anyway, either film is fun to watch if you enjoy pretty girls in bikinis, half-hearted romance dramas, beach scenes, competition, and surfing.  This film's got all that.  It inspired me to seek out more ""babefest"" beach films.",1338422400,3,902,4.670886075949367
4444432,3,B004PHE97E,"I didn't really care for Blue Crush 1 and only watched Blue Crush 2 because Sharni Vinson was in it. Well, I didn't know anything else going into the movie and found out it wasn't related to the first movie at all. I was perfectly fine with that because the first movie wasn't a good movie anyways.

This movie has plenty of hot girls in it and most of the time you see Sasha Jackson in a bikini looking sexy! The story is a little ify and choppy. It's not a storyline that I really would care  and it was kind of hard to follow. It's just something that keeps the movie going other you just have Sasha Jackson in the water surfing for no reason. lol

I think they just put in the ""Blue Crush title"" because they needed more people to watch this movie. And easier to promote it. Otherwise, it would be it's own movie and not as many people would care to watch it then. You could say the only relationship to the first movie is that there are 3 girls in the first movie and the second movie has 3 girls too. Otherwise, it's not related.

I didn't like that much of Sharni in the movie. She was in and out the whole time and seemed to be a big character in the beginning, but towards the middle she disappeared for awhile and suddenly just shows up again towards the end.

Still Sasha pretty HOT and didn't noticed Sharni was gone until I saw her again at the end. Watch this if you just wamt to see HOT CHICKS!!!",1337644800,,1411,4.135036496350365
4444433,1,B004PHE97E,"This movie has absolutely NOTHING in common with the original ""Blue Crush"" movie (which I liked a lot). Different actors, different characters, schlock storyline, and ugly waters (or at least the cinematography makes them look ugly). And you know, I had kind of expected a sequel - like what was going on with at least one of the girls from the original movie. But nope, nothing.

The surfing is fair - mediocre, kind of faked out (""you just caught the barrel of the day!"" Barrel? What barrel? That was a montage, not a freaking barrel. How many takes did it take?). The whole thing is just kind of surf soft-porn, which really made me mad because ""Blue Crush"" was so darn good and ""Blue Crush 2"" just sort of fed off its title but sucked. I mean Hawai'i compared to South Africa? Don't even make me laugh. Don't waste your money. I recommend ""Soul Surfer"" instead for a good girl surf fix with an inspiring storyline.

Ugh, just ugh.",1337472000,2,934,4.520710059171598
4444434,5,B004PHE97E,"i mean, can a brotha get some darkies in a movie made in South Africa? haha! j/k

unlike the first movie, which was more about some broke hot chick struggling for balance and freedom in her life, this movie is much more about SURFING! i normally don't write reviews for this kind of thing, but i honestly think this movie is better than the first one. true, it's the story of a spoiled brat with a free spirit, but it doesn't pretend to be otherwise, and if you can accept that much, you'll find that it's not only very fun, but a bit soulful as well.

the music in this movie is WAAAY better than the pop-rock soundtrack of the first Blue Crush. lots of punky indie rock in this soundtrack, plus a few well known old school tracks as well. ;)

much MORE and much BETTER surfing in this movie, too. it was so disappointing how little surfing there was in the first movie. this one really highlights some talent. there's a few camera angle tricks that bring at least one of the bad-ass tricks together, but that's WAY better than the cgi work done in the first movie.

the only really peculiar thing about the movie is how few black people there seem to be in South Africa. hahaha! yeah, colonialism sucks. *shrugs* anywho, it's a really fun movie for anyone who likes surfing flicks.",1326672000,,1283,4.40084388185654
