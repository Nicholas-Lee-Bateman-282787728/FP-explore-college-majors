2100643,4,B0002KPHXI,"As good as he is, I've yet to see Joseph Cotten in a truly animated role. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NIAGARA/dp/B000062XG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NIAGARA</a>&nbsp;is perhaps his most dramatic and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-THIRD-MAN/dp/B000IJ79U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE THIRD MAN</a>&nbsp;his most famous.) Zachary Morgan (Cotten) is a socially inert, shell-shocked, purple hearted, sergeant wondering what to do during an 8-day furlough from an army psychiatric hospital. On a train to Pinehill, he meets Mary Marshall (Ginger Rogers), lonely, downhearted manslaughter convict on a Christmas furlough from prison. Despite awkward moments initiated by flashbacks, their attraction grows. Zach openly confides secrets to Mary, though she feels reciprocation will bring condemnation. As Zach builds the courage to propose marriage, Mary recoils. Her teenage cousin Barbara Marshall (Shirley Temple) innocently reveals Mary's circumstances to Zach. He then must decide how to cope with the revelation.

I'LL BE SEEING YOU is definitely not a Rogers musical comedy nor is it a typical Cotten noir. Action is isolated to a dog encounter during an evening stroll. The only dancing by Rogers and Temple is the waltz at a New Year's celebration. Expect singing? There's a family Christmas carol around the dinner table. The dialogue isn't particularly clever but genuine. I'LL BE SEEING YOU is a rather tame linear drama inspiring hope while delivering a message about acceptance, honesty, and chastity that may well appeal to romantic audiences or those scarred by war or other personal adversities. Image quality is very good. With an all-star cast, mediocre plot and no DVD extras, I rate the movie 3.5 stars (rounded to 4).

2100645,4,B0002KPHXI,"An immortal wartime romance with Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten, I'LL BE SEEING YOU remains one of the most beloved films of the era.  Rogers plays Mary Marshall, a female ex-con on parole, who meets by chance the handsome yet severely shell-shocked soldier Zachary Morgan (Cotten).  Their romance plays out against the odds; two damaged people who find comfort and understanding in each other.

Based on the radio play ""Double Furlough"" by Charles Martin, the screenplay by Marion Parsonnet amiably showcases Rogers and Cotten in some of their most vivid and unguarded work.  With Shirley Temple, Spring Byington (who had previously co-starred in 1940's ""The Blue Bird""), Chill Wills and Tom Tully.",1137024000,21,700,5.223214285714286
2100646,5,B0002KPHXI,Great wartime story with so much heart. They don't make them like this anymore. Ginger Rogers plays a different kind of role then you're  use to seeing and she pulls it off great.,1125619200,15,179,4.424242424242424
2100647,5,B0002KPHXI,"Like the scent of perfume a girl from our youth wore, so this film is etched in the hearts of all who have seen it, only to be recalled with fondness when something small, like that special feminine fragrance, touches our senses and brings back memories. Until now, this is all we had. Fortunately, and at last, we can visit this wonderful film with Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton anytime we want, as after decades of waiting, it is now available to us.

 Based on a radio play by Charles Martin, this sweet and sentimental story very much has that involving feel many of the classy productions brought to the airwaves by Lux Radio Theatre had. It benefits greatly from the direction of William Dieterle, who allows the simple story to unfold in a natural way, with a minimalist approach. Both Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton underplay their roles, giving a premise which might have been a bit saccharine in other hands,  a very real and moving feel.

 One of the great songs made popular during WWII is used to good effect, as it sets the mood for a film about love during wartime. Both Mary (Ginger) and Zachery (Cotton) are shell-shocked as this film opens; he literally so, from war wounds and the psycological aftereffects, and she from a tragedy which left her in prison. He is on a furlough from the hospital to help regain his confidence and aid his recovery, and she is given a short leave back home during the holidays for good behavior, after which both must return.

 They meet on the train and when Mary gets off in Pine Hill, Zachery, who really has no place else to go, makes up a story so he can get off there and see her again. She can tell he is slightly lost in the real world, and so is she. It is obvious how much has changed since her time in prison when she tries to purchase a chocolate almond bar and gum in the train station. But it is wartime and she can not explain to the clerk where she has been, nor can she tell Zachery, who must believe in her and have hope so he can recover fully.

 As Mary adjusts to the outside and she begins to care for Zachery, she tries not to dream, as she knows dreams are impossible in her position. Spring Byington, Tom Tully, and a teenage Shirley Temple are all very good as Mary's only remaining family. Barbara (Temple) is a typical young girl with growing pains. Her reservations about Mary slowly fall away as they become closer, crushed completely when the reason for Mary's incarceration is brought out into the open.

 The feelings  of Mary and Zach grow as they do small town things through the Christmas season, and by the New Year's dance at the Y.M.C.A. they are in love. But a shadow is cast on their momentary happiness as little reminders of their past begin to creep in. For Zach it is a flashback, and for Mary it is a corsiage, a reminder of a time when she was twenty and lonely, and tragedy followed. She wants to tell Zach but can't, as he is scared and needs belief so he can get well.

 This film will certainly touch your heart in a very special way as the parting of these two lost souls who have found each other quickly approaches and we long for their happiness. You must see this film to discover their fate. It is something you will always remember. First time viewers of this film need patience. It does not grab you like most films, but rather begins as a simple caress, which grows into a full embrace by the film's conclusion. If you are sentimental or romantic in the least, you must own this wonderful film.",1112400000,165,3507,4.400309119010819
2100648,4,B0002KPHXI,"""I'll Be Seeing You"" is a bittersweet melodrama about a female convict, Mary Marshall (Ginger Rogers) who is released from the state penitentiary on a Christmas leave. Boarding a westbound train, Mary meets Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotten) an army sergeant who has just been released from a mental hospital. The two develop an affinity for one another on their journey, so much so that, after learning he'll be spending Christmas alone, Mary invites Zach to her place for dinner. The unlikely romance that blossoms between these two is both tragic and poignant. Mary keeps her incarceration a secret and Zach does his best to conceal the fact that he is a man with more than his share of psychological problems. Ultimately the story dissolves into the sort of treacle one might expect from war time schlock and nonsense, but it's central performances are so solid and poignant that one easily overlooks the implausibility of it all and has a tear jerking, heart-rending good cry and smile through it all.
MGM's DVD is impressive. The B&W picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up and there is more than a hint of pixelization in infrequent spots but overall the picture will surely not disappoint. The audio is mono but more than adequate for a film of this vintage. There are no extras.",1109980800,17,1446,4.906122448979592
2100649,5,B0002KPHXI,"I have been looking for this film on VHS (now DVD) since the dawn of time!  I saw it many years ago on television, and a friend had made a poor quality VHS off the television, so I could get a ""fix"" every so often.  Actually, I remember watching this on television as a kid.  The title song was my parents' song - it probably was for most WWII couples.  I'm surprised neither Ginger Rogers or Shirley Temple were nominated for Oscars - Shirley Temple's especially, as the teenaged cousin, Barbara, was a breakoout role and she really played against type.  There is some typical era sentimentality, naturally, but not much.  There is also one really funny FUNNY scene where Ginger and her aunt, played by Spring Byington, go to buy her a gown for New Year's Eve.  But of course, the core of this film, is the relationship between Mary, out on Christmas leave from prison, and Joseph Cotton, trying to hide his tenuous grasp on reality, caused by combat shock.  In flashback, told by Mary to her Barbara who cannot hide her scorn for the jailbird, she tells why she is in prison - basically for fighting off an attempted rape by her boss.  I cannot emphasize how moving this film is - without being mushy or corny or sloppy.  It's one of those movues that make people ask, ""Why can't they make movies like that any more?""

BUT - do keep that hankie ready!",1106265600,43,1353,4.437246963562753
2100650,5,B0002KPHXI,"at first i didn't know what to expect from this movie, seeing as it deals with the later part of ginger's peak career, (mid-late forties) I needn't have worried however, for Ginger and Mr. Joseph Cotten give truly wonderful performances. These were two of the best actors of their day, and it shows in their suble, yet powerful performnaces. They have a very intense chemistry together, and it's a shame they didn't work together again. They were friends off camera though, as Ginger was really friends with everyone in Hollywood back then. The color and sound qulaity here are terrific with good solid blacks, and crisp greys and whites. A teenage Shirley Temple appears as Ginger's cousin, and it's fun to see the two musical queens of the thirties together. Now all we need is some music! Although she appears sans her sprightly curls, Temple gives a spirited and realistic performance that really shows off her acting ability. Two scenes that really impressed me, the first, after saing goodnight to Ginger on New Years, he goes back to his room, where he has another phsychological attack. It's incredibly done, and really attention grabbing. When he looks up at the lightbulb, and hallucinates that it's a bomb falling, it's reaaly quite frightening. The other scene that I though was particarly well done was the very last scene. As ginger wals back to prison, Joseph is waiting for her in the shadow. In one swift motion, she spies him, drops her bag and runs into his arms. Other actresses may have looked, put down the bag, and then ran to him, but not Ginger, in one action, she can accomplish so much. The ending lines are dramatic, but not treachly, or overly so as the other reviewer may have suggested. Ginger says one of the things that she rarely says, ""I love you [so much]"" in the past, she has said, ""I'm in love with you/him"" etc... but never really a direct statement. He then explains that he'll be there for her and that he'll marry her when she gets out. It's bittersweet to be sure, but Optmism never alluded these two. This movie is a perfect example of how the movie's used to be, and probably never will be again. Not to mentio, all the talent that we used to get from the movies has disappeared, so see this nostalgic flick, and see the movies, Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten in their Golden age.",1098921600,69,2327,4.63680387409201
2100678,5,B0002KPHXI,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It's true, as other reviewers have pointed out, that there might be something missing in the chemistry between Ginger Rogers' character and the one played by Joseph Cotton.  But that's because Ginger's character is on furlough from prison and she's embarrassed and distressed about the fact.  Also, Joseph Cotten's character is suffering from severe shell-shock that he got when on the frontlines in World War II, in the Pacific theater.  Both characters, therefore, are tortured souls that come together on a train quite by accident and continue during the holiday season.  Ginger and Joseph are not miscast, at all.  They both are under extreme duress which is only intensified by Christmas and New Years celebrations that they are pushed into attending.  In particular, I found Joseph Cotton's depiction of his shell-shock to be very convincing and ironic, since this film was made during the war, not afterwards.  I'm sure that the Selznick company was roundly criticized for showing such a thing as the conflict was still going on and the likely bad effect it would have on troop and homefront morale.  The same goes for the street fight that Joseph Cotten's character gets into with a guard dog.  It's extremely well-played and poignant for the story as it showed he was making major strides toward recovery.  If any fault can be found with this movie it might be the part played by Shirley Temple and how silly and frivolous her character seemed to be when the central characters were suffering so.  But that's the way the story was written and it was perfectly understandable how it played out.  In the end, Shirley's character ""sees the light"" and apologizes to those she may have offended.  OK, this movie also has its sentimental and even tear-jerking aspects but what do you expect from a film of this time period?  It all worked well and the film deserves far more acclaim than it's received in the past.  My wife and I watch it every year during the holidays and think it's a 5-star classic.",1468972800,2,2041,4.82183908045977

2100681,5,B0002KPHXI,"Being huge fans of films from the 1940s and 1950s my wife and I wile away many evenings enjoying the fare on Turner Classic Movies.  This past weekend TCM presented an amazing film I had never seen before.  Ill Be Seeing You stars Ginger Rogers (Mary Marshall) and Joseph Cotton (Zachary Morgan) as a pair of social misfits who meet on a train and hit it off right away.  Each of them has a troubled backstory and when they find themselves falling hopelessly in love with one another each is uncertain how much they should reveal about themselves.  It is the tentative give-and-take between these two lonely souls that is really the crux of this film.  Aware of all of the potential obstacles I quickly found myself becoming emotionally involved and rooting for this romance to bloom. Cotton and Rogers do a splendid job of transitioning from despair to pure elation and then back again.  A lot of movies like this can be quite depressing but director William Dieterle chose not to dwell on the negative.  Rather, he surrounded his stars with a delightful supporting cast that includes 16 year old Shirley Temple, Spring Byington, Tom Tully and the irrepressible Chill Wills.  There are plenty of lighter moments in Ill Be Seeing You including Christmas dinner at the Marshall house and the New Years Eve dance at the local YMCA.  Meanwhile, it is always a treat to hear the title song ""Ill Be Seeing You"" which in my view is one of the great pop tunes of the 20th century.

The very next day I went on Amazon looking to purchase a copy of this film.  Unfortunately I discovered that Ill Be Seeing You has been out of print and largely unavailable for quite a few years (unless you care to spend $50.00 for a used copy).  This is a thoroughly entertaining film that I would definitely  watch at least a couple of times a year.  The screenplay is excellent and the acting top notch all the way around. Heres hoping that M-G-M or TCM will see fit to re-release it in the near future.  Very highly recommended!",1450828800,,2007,4.567039106145251
2100682,4,B0002KPHXI,"In my estimation, this movie must be viewed through the prism of a Christmas Story.  The story line itself is unlikely, but that is how many Christmas stories begin.  A wounded and traumatized GI meets a female prisoner, with a heart of gold, who is on Christmas furlough.

The cast is very interesting.  Ginger Rogers was a real star who may be becoming forgotten.  Joseph Cotten was never a super star, but appeared in many of the greatest movies of the time.  Shirley Temple, of course, was a child super star.  I think that for a film historian this movie is really interesting.

The movie was made during World War II.  America was a very different place and that was a very different time.  Thousands of young men were facing death every day and many were dying thousands of miles from home.  Again I cannot help but feel that zeitgeist plays a huge factor in the making of this fine, but not great film.

In summary, I truly believe that if a viewer really wants to appreciate this film, one must view it in context.  With all of the above in mind, I really enjoy this movie.",1450656000,,1082,4.431472081218274

2100699,4,B0002KPHXI,"If you're looking for a well-crafted sentimental romance, look no further than I'll Be Seeing You. Its polish, simplicity, and excellent cast makes what could have been a corny plot genuine and wonderful. Mary (Ginger Rogers) is on an eight day leave from prison for good behavior and she's spending it at Christmas with her aunt, uncle, and cousin (Shirley Temple). On the train to Pineville she meets a shell-shocked soldier (Joseph Cotton) who takes a quick liking to her and decides to also get off at Pineville in hopes of seeing her again.

Of course, they do see each other again, and his affections make her feel more legitimate and her affections help his mind to heal.

It is a shame that this film is out of print, because it is a gem that should be more available. The Christmas theme makes it an excellent choice for holiday viewing.",1402099200,2,846,4.633333333333334
2100700,5,B0002KPHXI,"I'll Be Seeing You grabbed my attention from the beginning until the very end of the film! The actors all give outstanding, convincing performances; the sets are very detailed and reflect so much forethought; the plot moves along at just the right pace; the use of lighting helps to make the scenes just right and the choreography and the cinematography both shine, too! Ginger Rogers certainly proved that she could act in a serious role that didn't require much dancing and Joseph Cotton was just right for the part. In addition, Shirley Temple plays somewhat against type by being not always the good little girl she was known to be by movie going audiences--and Shirley succeeds very well here! Kudos also goes to director William Dieterle (and George Cukor) for also making this an exceptionally fine motion picture. Indeed, everything is so well done that when others say that they don't make movies like this anymore I definitely agree with them--this is a memorable film that couldn't have been done any better. True, some people will say this story is corny but it tugged at my heartstrings and I loved it.

At the start, we meet two rather lonely souls in a train station at Christmastime during World War Two--one is Mary Marshall (Ginger Rogers) who is on a brief leave from prison for good behavior and the other is Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotton) who is also briefly away from a hospital that treats ""neuro-psychiatric"" soldiers suffering from ""shell shock"" but we call it post-traumatic stress disorder today. Mary takes the train that stops at Pinehill and by chance Zachary sits opposite her on the same train, too--and Zachary takes such a liking to Mary that he decides to make up a lie about visiting a sister in Pinehill so he can get off there with Mary and hopefully see her again.

And while the two certainly do see each other again--not long after at that--there are a few other people who figure into the picture. Mary is staying with her sweet Aunt, Mrs. Marshall (Spring Byington) and her Uncle, Mr. Marshall (Tom Tully). Mary also shares a room with the too young to understand even though she thinks she's all grown up at seventeen cousin, Barbara (Shirley Temple) who has separate soap dishes, towels and even parts of the clothing closet for Mary as if Mary had some sort of communicable disease.

Zachary and Mary become fond of each other rather quickly and their blossoming romance is very sweet to watch. Zachary is also welcomed into the Marshall home as they are told that that his ""sister"" had to go away leaving him alone for the holiday. While Zachary eventually tells Mary his secret about his post-traumatic stress disorder and hopes Mary will still want him as a romantic interest, Mary is far more reluctant to reveal her secret to Zachary--she has served only three years of her six year prison sentence and she is greatly ashamed of her plight even though as we learn Mary was truly a victim of a man trying to violate her and she had absolutely no intentions of doing him any real harm--he fell out of a fourteenth floor window when she pushed him off her during a violent struggle. Mary also fears that if Zachary knew her ""secret"" it could give him a psychological setback. (True, Zachary and Mary might not have been quite so secretive about their problems in today's society with out different values and general outlooks on life but that's another story.)

There's much more to the plot than just this--no plot spoilers here--watch and find out! Watch closely and you'll see John Derek as Lieutenant Bruce and Chill Wills plays Swanson.

I'll Be Seeing You is an incredibly special motion picture.  I highly recommend it for fans of the actors in this film. In addition, people who like dramas with family and romantic themes will not be disappointed.",1395619200,4,3804,4.756060606060606
2100701,5,B0002KPHXI,"Truly memorable performances and fine chemistry between Joseph Cotton and Ginger Rogers highlight an unusual story about two strangers who meet on a train going home for Christmas, each concealing a dark secret.  The show is almost stolen by the actors portraying Ginger Rogers' aunt and uncle, who open their home and their hearts to two troubled souls without a hint of hesitation.  The relationship between Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton is very nicely modulated, and their torments are not sugar coated.  The proceedings are capped off by a beautifully staged New Year's dance celebration.  Highly recommended.",1394582400,3,615,5.309278350515464

Such behavior is a bad example for children to view (and was at the time of release).

Dishonesty will not lead to a healthy love relationship, then or now, between any two persons.  It is unhealthy to portray on screen, even in fiction, dishonesty as an acceptable model of behavior.

2100707,4,B0002KPHXI,"I'll Be Seeing You captures the loneliness of two people who - besides their own serious problems - just don't fit into the bustling wartime image we often see of America in film during that time. The opening scene is in a busy train station. We quickly focus in on two travelers. She (Ginger Rogers as Mary Marshall) is uncomfortable when she tries first to buy a stick of gum and then a chocolate bar and is rebuffed by the sales clerk as though she had been asking to buy gold bullion at a five and dime. He (Joseph Cotten as Zachary Morgan) is uncomfortable because he wants to buy reading material and all that is available is full of news about the war and images that you can tell make him squeamish.

Zach is suffering from what would be called PTSD today due to battle fatigue, and he's ashamed of that fact, afraid of winding up like the shell-shocked WWI soldier he knew as a boy.

Mary is a convict out on Christmas furlough, although what she is serving time for will probably be a shock to modern sensibilities - I know it was for me. She is also ashamed - understandably perhaps for being a convict, not so understandably for what she did to become one. I'll let you watch the movie and see what I'm talking about here.

Against this backdrop of people who feel badly for the positions they are in due to social mores of the 1940's - soldiers are always brave and good girls never get themselves into the position Mary got herself into, these two lonely people find each other and connect. At first Zach lies to Mary about his situation, but then tells her the truth. Mary chooses to keep the truth from Zach, partly because she loves him and doesn't want to lose him, but mainly because her company is making him well - he says her self-confidence is giving him confidence - and she doesn't want to set back his recovery.

Mary is staying with her aunt, uncle, and cousin during the holidays, and this warm family setting has both of them healing just a bit. Shirley Temple plays the cousin that is too young to know why Mary is in prison or wear lipstick according to her parents, but is apparently old enough to go out unchaperoned with a Lieutenant on leave who is probably five years older than she! Spring Byington plays the aunt who is supportive overall but still drops phrases from time to time that leave you wondering about the overall wisdom of her advise. For example, she keeps telling Mary to settle for second best and pretend it's first best - that's what she did!. Rather wacky advice by today's standards, but maybe mainstream feelings for people who married during the roaring twenties, and then raised a family during the depression and world war.

I highly recommend this sentimental favorite of mine. I'm rather surprised it hasn't become more of a Christmas standard, because even though in many ways it is a unique snapshot in time, the story of two lonely people finding each other in a world that would probably judge them severely if they were open about their problems is universal.",1369526400,,3026,4.514598540145985

""I'll Be Seeing You""
(MGM, 1945)

This fascinating WWII melodrama features two of my favorite classic Hollywood actors, Joseph Cotton and Ginger Rogers, acting acting against type as two troubled, damaged individuals, each in need if redemption but so broken they don't know how to ask for it. Cotton is a ""shell-shocked"" (PTSD) soldier, on leave from the war, back home where civilians blandly cheer him as a hero, and where little kids playing with pop-guns give him the shakes. Rogers has her own tragedy to contend with: she's been given a holiday furlough from the state prison where she's serving a term for manslaughter (the telling of that tale is a masterpiece of melodramatic scriptwriting bravura!)

What's most intriguing about this film is that it was made during the war, and not after -- several postwar films dealt with social issues such as the shortages in housing and jobs, the psychological problems of returning vets, etc.  But seeing these kind of issues in a film made during the war, at a time when patriotic propaganda was the norm, is actually a bit unnerving. Combined with the over-the-top romantic plot, it's a bit like seeing a collaboration between Preston Sturges and Douglas Sirk... Great stuff!

Somehow the big movie guides have missed the point of this film. Far from sentimental, it takes on two highly controversial themes in 1944, when it was directed by the celebrated William Dieterle [Hunchback of Notre Dame 1939, Dr. Erlich's Magic Bullet, The Devil and Daniel Webster]. The wartime audience must deal with a soldier returned to the States for shell shock--often thought of then as cowardice. Today it is called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The scenes when the panic comes upon him are still striking today. Joseph Cotten's performance is quiet and powerful--as we would expect from his appearances in Citizen Kane and The Third Man. The soldier meets a beautiful womam who is a victim, as the film makes clear, of women's inequality before the law. She is on Christmas furlough from prison. They don't know it at first, but their individual sufferings are helping them to get in touch with each other, even though they each have a secret they are trying to guard. Ginger Rogers is best known of course for her superb dancing with Fred Astaire [the reminiscence in the background of Fellini's Ginger and Fred]. Rogers turns in her own powerful performance. I ask myself why Hollywood failed, after this film, to give her roles like those going to Barbara Stanwick and Joan Crawford. The fine script sees to it that what the lovers find at last is well-earned.",1282694400,6,1529,5.322314049586777
2100725,5,B0002KPHXI,This was a very interesting movie with a darker side to it. Ginger Rogers is wonderful playing against type and pulling it off. The family itself is very good and Shirley Temple does a great job as the insensitive teenager.,1265414400,5,223,4.6

2100727,5,B0002KPHXI,"STORY - A soldier and a young, attractive woman in a hurry to catch the train 'home' for the Christmas holidays, both stop at the newspaper stand simultaneously. The soldier (Cotten) is obviously nervous and distracted and the woman (Rogers) is confused why gum is not available. They end up sitting across from one another on the train. The conversation is awkward but the soldier decides quickly to create a story about going to the same destination in the hopes of seeing her again. As the story develops we learn the secrets each is carrying and the obvious risk there is in sharing that secret with someone they might care about. They each must deal with their secrets apart, also, as they wrestle the demons from the past. The story of the soldier could easily apply to any one of our troops today coming home from Iraq or Afghanistan. This is a well done story and performance by everyone involved. Shirley Temple is a little over the top as Roger's niece but turns in a solid performance as well. While not as well known as THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, it is a worthwhile addition to your Christmas collection. Enjoy the Christmas season and remember those you meet may be dealing with unseen demons in their lives. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews. 12/05/09.",1259971200,8,1282,4.602620087336245

2100729,4,B0002KPHXI,One on her way up and one on her way out.  This movie is smaltzy. But it is one of the first to deal with Battle Fatigue...Yes you should buy it. Why? Shirley Temple gives a great performance for the role she was forced to play...Ginger Rogers is hard to ignore in her role...she owns it.,1229731200,,288,4.142857142857143
2100730,4,B0002KPHXI,"This is a very good movie that is seldom seen on the classic movie channels, but is definitely worth watching. While the idea of a movie about an inmate on furlough from a woman's prison and a shell shocked veteran might seem a little depressing, it's really not. The scenes between Joseph Cotten and Ginger Rogers are very touching and the supporting actors, which include Spring Byington and an adolescent Shirley Temple, were well cast. The result is a warm hearted and inspirational movie. It's one of Ginger Rogers best vehicles and, im my opinion, ranks up there with Kitty Foyle.",1229385600,5,586,4.811881188118812
2100731,5,B0002KPHXI,"This is a very good movie with a great cast. Ginger Rogers portrays a woman on furlow from prison who meets Joseph Cotton, a soldier suffering from combat fatigue (We now call it post traumatic stress disorder). The setting is WWII era Arizona at Christmas. You get a bonus because you see Shirley Temple as a yound adult actress.

This movie, like The Bishop's Wife, is a good Christmas movie that most people overlook.",1229040000,4,420,4.675675675675675
2100732,4,B0002KPHXI,"My mother used to talk about this movie when I was younger, and how she loved it.  I finally found it on Amazon, purchased it, and invited her to watch with me.  It has the look and feel of the old war (the Big One)with a slightly different twist--Ginger Rogers is a murderer on Christmas furlough.  Shirley Temple is classic Shirley--neither impressive nor instrumental to the plot--as the teenaged daughter of Ginger's relatives.  Joseph Cotten, suffering from battle fatigue, predictably falls for Ginger, rescuing her from a vicious dog and relying on her image to pull him through a perspiration-packed relapse.  ""I'll Be Seeing You"" comes off more as a made-for-television movie, but because the people in the movie are major stars, they brighten the screen more than the lackluster plot could ever do.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, the company, and the quiet one hour and twenty-five minutes spent.  I would recommend it for those who are nostalgic, but I don't believe it would stand up for the younger generation that craves blood, violence and sex on every frame.",1214352000,3,1074,4.933333333333334

2100734,5,B0002KPHXI,"Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten are two troubled souls who meet on a train shortly before Christmas.  It is wartime and he is a shell-shocked soldier on furlough while she is on holiday furlough from prison where she has been serving a sentence for accidental manslaughter.  Neither is confident enough to share their own story, but they are attracted to each other and begin a whirlwind romance filled with love, laughter, and the normalcy they are both desperate to regain.

All good things must come to an end, and their furloughs are no exception.  Will they be able to reveal their deepest secrets?  Can true love find a way to work through the hurt and sadness?  Can each accept the other's past and uncertain future?

This is an extraordinary movie and a wonderful love story filled with wholesome family life, compassionate characters, and a most realistic look at the battle fatigue experienced by soldiers.  The stellar cast includes a teenage Shirley Temple and Spring Byington in her pre-December Bride days.  For those of us who wish they still made movies like they used to, this is one to treasure.",1196035200,11,1113,4.8465608465608465

In this war-time drama, Ginger Rogers plays a woman who is let out of jail to rejoin her uncles and cousin for Christmas. Only for Christmas. On the train, she meets a soldier with war traumas, Joseph Cotten. As he descends on the same stop, a series of events will lead to a gentle, often heartwarming closeness between the two, shadowed by the deceits both at first did not reveal. The movie finale should rank among the best Christmas movie endings ever. it's also an added bonus to watch the teen Shirley Temple as the cousin, if you're a movie buff.",1167955200,15,666,4.5041322314049586
