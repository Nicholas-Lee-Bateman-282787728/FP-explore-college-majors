8050516,5,B0007QCLP4,"I liked the movie very much. This movie reminds me of many of Mel Brooks zany movies which I enjoy greatly. One of the producers names is Oscar Brooks, I wonder if he is related to Brooks in any way. In any case the movie was crazy, silly, lots of good songs and very enjoyable. ""Lo Que Le Paso a Sanson"" is one of my favorite Tin Tan movies. Good for viewing by the whole family.",1282953600,,380,4.0131578947368425
