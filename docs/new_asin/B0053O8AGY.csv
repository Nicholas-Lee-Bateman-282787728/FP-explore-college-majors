4542576,5,B0053O8AGY,"We love British Murder Mysteries and Midsommer has never disappointed.  Midsommer Murders Series are filled with plot, character development, clues, and enough red herrings to keep you guessing until the end. If you want blood, gore and special effects then by any US made murder show.  There are precious few Midsommer's left starring John Nettles and I highly recommend getting this and the rest of the Midsommer Series.  His last series will be #19.  I recommend pre-ordering #19 as soon as possible.  We recently saw an episode from series 20 this summer in Europe.  We missed DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) but his replacement DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) was marvelous and should keep the Midsommer Murder Series alive for a long time.",1315612800,,744,5.008130081300813

It's a drag to wait for something that's already available in Britain, but then again, it gives us something to look forward to.

THE MYSTERIES
Small Mercies--Little Worthy's model village is the highlight of its tourist trade--until a dead body disfigures it.
The Creeper--A cat burglar's robberies expose the dark secrets of a prominent family.
The Great and the Good--A village school's possible closing leads to murder, mayhem, and a sleepwalking schoolteacher.

John Nettles is still in top form, making it sad that he will be leaving after set 20. But at least I will be able to enjoy a few more of his quirky investigations here.
Series 12 was one episode short in production, making this the shortest Acorn DVD release of the series. John's last series (13) returns to its full 8 episode run which will mean that Acorn's sets 19 & 20 will return to 4 episodes each next year.

DVD FEATURES INCLUDE an interview with star Jason Hughes (23 min.).

4542581,5,B0053O8AGY,"Since I wanted to be the first kid on the block to view Midsomer Murders, set 18, I ordered it directly from Acorn Media, and just watched the three episodes.
  The series' quality remains very high, and I join all MM fans in lamenting the imminent departure of John Nettles, however I trust that the creative team has chosen well in casting Neil Dudgeon as his replacement, though I am totally unfamiliar with his work.
  Incidentally, the first episode of this set, ''Small Mercies,'' has, in a small part, one Abigail Thaw, daughter of our beloved Morse, John Thaw.",1308787200,14,568,4.707070707070707
4542582,5,B0053O8AGY,"This series reached continuing perfection long ago. Series 18 contains yet 3 additional episodes which have Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby being played by
John Nettles. He has toughness toward crime, but softness toward his daughter Culley who doesn't appear in this set. This cop character makes watching suspenseful murder mysteries a pleasure. It's primarily murder mystery in a quaint little rural village in Midsomer County. (The MM series is known for it's picturesque footage.) Multiple murders have been happening for so long (a trademark of this show) it's a wonder there is anyone left to arrest. Fear not, this series is as good as any you have seen. If you are new to Midsomer Murders and CI Barnaby, then hold on to your hat. I'd strongly recommend buying one of the box sets already available.
IN SET #18, wife Joyce is still in the picture, making moments of each episode a homey experience, but not for long. Every phone call seems to be a new murder, and a call away from the delightful cooking that Joyce provides for her love. Barnaby keeps his helper, DS Jones (Jason Hughes), very busy. Smashing series, Spot ON since the very first episodes, many years ago. But can the show survive without Barnaby (Nettles)? We'll be finding out soon enough. But not in Set 18.

3 longer-than-feature-length episodes makes the per episode price a bargain compared to new feature-length theater movies.
Price was reduced from other sets like #17 reflecting 3, not 4, episodes.
SUBTITLES included.  Entertainment guaranteed.
Watching old and new guest stars are as fun as the plots themselves.

Small Mercies
Gulliver (corpse) comes to a small English village, tied to the earth, but stabbed to death. Since one murder is never enough in Midsomer, his girlfriend is also killed. On then to a third, not that unusual in this series, when an elderly lady long in the community is killed. Barnaby has his investigative skills tested when this series of murders and evidence seems to go back several decades. Secrets are also common in Midsomer.  Look for stars Olivia Colman (Peep Show), Caroline Blakiston (Scoop, see it), Margaret Tyzack (Indiana Jones), David Ryall (good in Lytton's Diary), and more.

The Creeper
Chief constable's house is robbed by a person having gotten the crime name, Creeper.  Later he pays CI Barnaby's home a visit as well, but for more interesting reasons than burgling. An old crook, Godbolt, was celebratized in a book by writer, Dr. David Roper (Rik Mayell guest). University contemporaries, Chettham & Filby, and Roper are involved, but how? And murder begins to take out the players of this mystery. What is the link between another Chettham family member and the night-bandit, Creeper? Barnaby has his hands full, even with spoon fed clues. Jenny Agutter guests as a Chettham; and Amanda Ryan (Forsyte Saga) guest stars as a Filby.

The Great and the Good
Until a man is found murdered in her garden, a teacher of town is not taken seriously about her constant suggestions of someone entering her house. The victim was believed to be interested in the teacher, making her suspect immediately, well, according to wealthy Zukie (Suzanne Burden- `MT-Bleak House'). The next murder, multiples obligatory for Midsomer, is a fix-it man. Is the teacher the murderess, as she begins to believe herself? Barnaby's investigations uncover some interesting items in the teacher's home. Paul Kaye guest stars as does Tim Wylton (`The Bretts' Sutton), & Paul Chapman (Colditz).

As always, Midsomer Murders is a mix of humor, crime, and relationships. This show completed writing the book on good crime investigation TV long ago and never looked back. A fantastic cast, nearing an end with Nettles, however. Not to fear yet, plenty of DVD episodes to be released first. And the show will go on with a new cast lead. Any show that is written this well, can deal with that issue. Midsomer Murders is an investment in more than entertainment. I've noticed that used sell for almost as much as new. But I own them all, and I've not tried to sell even one. My wife would not let me if I wanted to.

4542583,5,B0053O8AGY,"Based on a set of only seven novels by Caroline Graham (beginning with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killings-at-Badger-s-Drift/dp/1933397047/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killings at Badger's Drift</a>), Midsomer Murders is a long-running and very popular series that debuted in the U.K. in 1997. The series features the likable Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and is set in the fictional English county of Midsomer which consists of several villages each of which seems to rival Cabot Cove, Maine for their improbably high murder rates.

Graham had a penchant for ""interesting"" characters and over the years, the show's writers have stayed true to the author's taste. Often quirky, sometimes downright odd, the characters and their many idiosyncrasies are central to each episode. Along with the uniformly first-rate acting, the quality writing and the intricate plots, they have helped to keep the show dependably entertaining. It is the only television show on my auto-buy list.

With elements of the traditional whodunit, non-graphic police procedural and old-fashioned British cozy, Midsomer Murders should appeal to a variety of murder mystery fans. Barnaby is an approachable type and episodes nicely mix his work and home lives. His wife Joyce and daughter Cully appear often and occasionally find themselves involved in his investigations. The series has very little overall story arc and episodes exist more or less independent of one another. IMHO, they need not be viewed in broadcast order. Barnaby's Detective Sergeants do change a number of times over the run of the series, though, so viewers who might be annoyed by viewing episodes out of order for that reason should start at the beginning. (Oddly, with this series, it's actually Box Set #5 that contains the first aired episodes. After that, proceed with Box Sets #1, #2, #3, #4, #6 etc.)

My only gripe with Set 18 is that it includes only three episodes, rather than the more usual four. They complete the 12th Season of the show and are as follows:

* Small Mercies (Episode 71): In a model village located in Little Worthy, a man's body is found tied to the ground a la Gulliver in the land of Lilliput.
* The Creeper (Episode 72): Has ""The Creeper"", a cat burglar selectively stealing from homes in the Midsomer villages moved on to murder?
* The Great & the Good (Episode 73): Schoolteacher Connie Bishop fears she is killing the men of Badger's Drift while sleep-walking.

Because of the somewhat unorthodox behavior of a number of the characters, some rare flashes of nudity and the often gruesome nature of the crimes, I feel Midsomer Murders is best suited to older teens and adults.

Highly recommended.

Notes:
* All three episodes included in Set 18 have SDH subtitles.
* If you're thinking of waiting for the Blu-ray version, please note that as of today, nearly four months after the DVD release of Set 17, the Blu-ray version of that set is not yet available for order. If you're not in any hurry...  :-)
* After The Great & the Good, only 8 episodes remain for release here in the United States starring John Nettles as Tom Barnaby. Barnaby then retires from the force (and Nettles from the series) and his cousin John Barnaby, portrayed by Neil Dudgeon, takes over his post.",1308268800,161,3335,5.151571164510166

4542718,5,B0053O8AGY,"Fans of MIDSOMER MURDERS will know that the great John Nettles has left the series, although it remains in production in the U.K. This makes the remaining episodes that Acorn Media is still, thankfully, releasing to North Americans, all that much more to be savoured.

The three mysteries here, Small Mercies; The Creeper; and The Great & The Good, continue the standard of excellence one expects from this hallmark British program.

Two of the episodes are particularly good, with Small Mercies providing a brilliant return to some of the more creative ways of committing murder that were so delightfully evident in the first episodes of the series.

By now the chemistry between Nettles and co-star Jason Hughes (as DS Ben Jones) is perfect and one really cant find anything to critique.

Even the best shows have the naysayers, though, and recently MIDSOMER MURDERS came under attack as having an agenda that does not represent visible minorities often enough. In other words, the concern about the show (to some people) is that it is white bread.

The producer of MIDSOMER MURDERS, Brian True-May, responded to the criticism. stating that the show is predicated on English eccentricities, and this requires a certain traditional English look in the localities they focus on, namely the fictional villages and boroughs of Midsomer. One can imagine the storm of protest in this politically-correct age!

It could be argued that rather than having an agenda, the show has a lack of an agenda  no political or social commentary, just fun stories and great characters in picturesque settings. Controversy or no, the fact remains that each and every episode of MIDSOMER MURDERS has been and continues to be wonderfully entertaining stuff.

And isn't that what really counts?

There are eight more episodes featuring John Nettles before he retires and is replaced on the show by his cousin, Neil Dudgeon.  Enjoy them while you can in MIDSOMER MURDERS: SET 18.",1397433600,,1956,5.065420560747664

The main character is a detective who is happily married and doesn't have a drinking problem, which seems unusual from the often more disturbed, hard drinking, going through a divorce portrayal of detectives.

The other is that to my surprise but not disappointment, they occasional throw in a zinger like 'maybe ghosts are real'.  i would normally take a dim view of such, but since it is a rare ocurance and a brief snippet, I find it acceptable.

THE ""FOYLE'S WAR"" IS ANOTHER SUGGESTION THAT I WOULD ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT WAS VERY WELL DONE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN A MOVIE ENDS AND YOU ARE STILL HUNGRY FOR MORE, YOU REALIZE JUST HOW GOOD THE EXPERIENCE WAS. PERHAPS NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT IN MY OPINION AMONG THE BEST. GREAT SCRIPT WRITING, STORY TELLING AND ACTING. ALSO CONSIDER THE ""INSPECTOR LEWIS"" SERIES - ANOTHER WINNER JUST BELOW THOSE MENTIONED. HAPPY VIEWING!",1331337600,,600,4.778846153846154

My favorite one in this set is The Creeper a rich family has a lot of complications as in maybe someone is not the father of his children,also a masked person is breaking into houses for unknown reasons,and they break into Barnaby's house too,murder and mystery abound in this episode. The Great and the Good has a teaher somehow involved in a murder or two with some strange things going on,mystery fans will figure it out fast. Small Mercies has a tiny town in the middle of a big town and a murder which will baffle you,Barnaby and Jones soon figure out the tiny town murder,Midsomer comes through again so enjoy.",1325721600,,789,4.486111111111111

I'm looking forward to the next set and am interested in seeing how the show evolves after Tom Barnaby retires and his cousin takes over. While murder is serious and treated that way, the interplay of the characters - who are warm, funny, and regular folks - makes the show enjoyable to watch. Of course, no one would want to live in Midsomer given the high homicide rate!",1323648000,,466,4.559523809523809

Jane Wymark is always impeccable as Barnaby's wife, as tart and sharp as Midsomer raspberry preserves.

Only criticism of Set 18: it would have been better for the young woman who was recently promoted to detective
to have a more important role than a shoulder to cry on for the victims.
She was allowed to use her skills more usefully in previous episodes.
Main criticism of the series as a whole: anything remotely Christian is savaged in almost every episode (1 through 18).
This is unfair and extremely biased. If it had been done to Judaism, Islam or other religions, there would have been huge charges of discrimination.",1320710400,,599,4.882352941176471

4542998,2,B0053O8AGY,"While the crimes stories are always disturbing, we buy this show for the quality of the production in general. The scenery is beautiful and the stories are usually very interesting and the relationships somewhat funny. It just isn't your average crime story. I don't know weather to buy any further sets of this show or not. I found sets # 16 & # 17 to be very gory when compared to most of the previous sets. The gore overshadows the otherwise quality production at this point. Just because a crime is committed doesn't mean that they have to film every last drop of blood. If I wanted all of that and more, I could just watch Law and Order SVU. My question is, does the relentless gore continue in set 18 and beyond?",1320019200,4,718,4.406015037593985

Three episodes from broadcast Season 12 are new to DVD: ""The Great and the Good,"" ""The Creeper"" and ""Small Mercies.""  After all these years, are we to believe that everyone in Midsomer County is a murderer?  But thankfully for Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby the murder mysteries keep coming.  John Nettles no longer plays Barnaby, he has become Barnaby!

A memorable episode is the quirky ""Small Mercies"" about a miniature model village in Little Worthing.  The tiny town is a tourist attraction until a body shows up.  I liked the mini make-believe people staring at the real life Gulliver sized corpse.  Nice touch.",1319155200,,710,4.858333333333333

The prices need to be cut back!,1316649600,,308,4.066666666666666
4543020,5,B0053O8AGY,"The Midsomer Murder/mystery series has brought to my life many hours of great entertainment.  Season eighteen (18) shows that the series is still going strong because I was highly entertained by the three (3) episodes on three discs.  Once again, we go behind the beautifully ""manicured"" lawns (gardens) in the very beautiful little English villages of Midsomer to find loads of debauchery and murder along with some highly eccentric characters and once again Chief Inspector Sergeant Barnaby and his assistant Detective Jones are on hand to solve all of the murders and mayhem and they, per usual, solve all of the atrocities so very well in this season.

Season eighteen (18) has many well-known British actors and actresses including one of my very favorites, Margaret Tyzack playing a very bitter character so very well--she's fabulous.  I have made no secret, on this board, that I adore John Nettles as Chief Inspector Barnaby.  Again in Season eighteen (18).  , he's on hand to solve some horrendous cases and solve them he does with his usual wit and wonderful manner--Nettles is so very good in this role.  Again Assistant Sergeant Jones, as acted by Jason Hughes whose acting, in this role, I too have come to adore, as Barnaby's ""side kick"" acts his role with much humor--he's marvelous.

Indeed Season eighteen (18) of ""Midsomer Murders"" is some fine entertainment.",1316217600,2,1377,5.035242290748899

I have enjoyed watching the maturation of the actors.  I like seeing the young assistants in their role to the usually never-crack-a-smile inspector.  Not to be missed.  I order this from BBC direct and usually get it months ahead of Amazon.  Unfortunately, I have watched the whole series within about 24 hours and have to wait for the next installment.",1315958400,,492,4.662790697674419
4543022,5,B0053O8AGY,"Series 18 is only 3 episodes long.  However, they are really good episodes.  Our favorite episode in the set is ""The Creeper"".  I can't tell why or I will give away a plot.  The one about the little village that tries to add a little fun for people turns out to be the opposite and we couldn't pin down the murderer.  The sleep walking school teacher is very interesting as well.  The set is worth buying even though it is short one episode. Midsomer Murders is a habit forming series.  We own all but seven earlier ones and have now pre-ordered set 19.  We hope that they continue with the stories after Nettles retires from the series having then DCI John just as Inspector Lewis took over for Inspector Morse eventually.  We look forward to meeting the new DCI in series 19.  Even though we watch all of the sets over and over we still forget who is doing the murdering so, though, the story is famiiliar we still have to go all the way through to see the conclusion.  That is the value of owning the sets because we CAN look at them over and over.  We are older people so most of the movies out in theaters now don't appeal to us so Midsomer Murders has become our Saturday night popcorn, candy and pop movie night.  There is seldom anything any better in the theaters.  TV generally has turned into mostly garbage so if it weren't for the British TV series like Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lewis, the old Inspector Morse series, and many others, we wouldn't have anything to watch.  So we appreciate having Midsomer Murders and other British shows available to us.  Set 18 may be a shorter series but not the least disapointing in quality of acting and drama.  We highly recommend the Midsomer Murders series to everyone that loves mysery, drama and yes, even a bit of humor.
