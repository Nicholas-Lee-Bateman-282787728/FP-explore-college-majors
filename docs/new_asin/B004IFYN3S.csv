8430688,3,B004IFYN3S,This movie is  another look at the  first clash between the US Army and the Indians in the Post Civil War Period. Richard Denning and Dennis Morgan are the Leads. Why it plays  with the truth it is a film to enjoy  on  a day when there is nothing to watch.,1322438400,,256,3.9411764705882355
8430689,1,B004IFYN3S,"One look at the credits gives you fair warning that this isn't going to be ""Shane"" or ""The Searchers""! In fact it's not even Audie Murphy in ""Drums Across the River""! Obviously designed for the lower half of double bill programs in 1957, it's pretty lame even by the standards of that undemanding category. You've got Dennis Morgan and Richard Denning, both on the downhill slide of their careers as the leading actors, Paula Raymond, whoever she is,  cheapskate extraordinaire Sam Katzman as the producer and shlockmaster William Castle in his pre-horror mode as the director. If that isn't a recipe for disaster I don't know what is! About the only thing that it has going for it is Color by Technicolor. The stock footage of marauding Indians and charging Cavalry (which comprises much of the picture!) was obviously lifted from an older and better western and it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the cheaper Katzman produced material shot with the new cast. It's been shown on the Sony Movie Channel (in HD) in it's proper widescreen ratio so I'm not sure why this DVD is apparently in the full screen format. If you have to see every western ever made (like me!) I'd check this one out on the Sony Movie Channel or Turner Classic Movies before spending money on this burn on demand disc which you'll probably only want to watch once before you stick it in the box for Goodwill. Don't say I didn't warn you!",1320364800,6,1419,4.630952380952381
