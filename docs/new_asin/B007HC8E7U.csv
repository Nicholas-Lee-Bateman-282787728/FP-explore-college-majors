5086025,3,B007HC8E7U,"Two twenty three year old females seek solace in a company of each other by exercising a foreplay of which their opening-the-movie kissing is the most memorable and original deed this work had just only been nominated for the Award, perhaps.

Bella is attracted to Marina while, according to her stories, she was sexually-active around and ended on a request of Marina in a hospital bed of Marina's dad passing away. Marina, attracted to women, lived and worked with her best and only friend-a father of her, atheist and an architect, and looked after him till his last breeze and last molecule of his ashes was scattered with the wind over the sea. Her need for a woman pushed her into intimate relations with a man-from-a-balcony -as it was clear from English subtitles,- a visiting professional as understanding a film original tongue could have deciphered.

Extremely boring, suicidal and incest-inclined story hardly attracts even with nowadays same-gender-affairs motives and explicit copulating activities.",1345766400,2,1013,5.246913580246914

The film is visually stunning, unique, and brave in that it doesn't simply show a life, a history, or a particular point of view. It is directed by a woman I've never heard of before, takes place in Greece and doesn't depend on dialogue to tell a story. You see it, hear it, feel it and can almost touch it....... just as you can in real life. I love the silence, the lack of an orchestrated soundtrack, the songs by Suicide (a Psychobilly Band). There are no action sequences, special effects, or 3-D because it doesn't need it. You are not given any clues and it doesn't tell you how to feel or react. I think I can safely say that most people in the Northern Hemisphere would not like this film; which makes it very special indeed. What higher praise can I give it? This film could not, would not, ever be made in America. Now that the world is splattered with Starbucks, Mcdonald's, KFC, smart phones and the internet it is wonderful to see a film that expresses a forgotten, inner world. We don't consciously live the moments in the film. In reality... life and death happen to us... and we react accordingly. The film asks us to see and feel what is too often ignored, denied or left unsaid in this culture. It speaks to the heart not to the mind and must be viewed that way in order to appreciate it's value.",1340755200,8,1345,4.423387096774194

8516569,4,B007HC8E7U,"Well, first of all, there are a lof of things to see in this film.
The movie is more of a shower then telling.
The director is a woman and a very delicate one. She knows how to experiment and in a good way.

The movie was both sexual and funny/ serious at the same time. What did I just said?
You just have to watch it. It's a mixed up feeling I guess.

Ariane Labed is living in a boring factory town with her roommate Evangelia Randou.
Her father is dying of cancer and she spends a lot of time with him too.
Her relationship with Evangelia is a strange one. They are not lovers but it is not just a friendship.
According to her, she is flirting around with all the men around her include her father.
One day she even asks her to have sex with her father since her father is dying and he haven't got laid for years.
She even accepts her suggestion.
The other thing is that two constantly do this strange step thing together outside which is more like a choreographed dancing like step. Really strange but fun to watch somehow.
It is so natural that I cannot complain the director that she is making this moment to just show the audience the newwaveish picture to look cool.

The thing about Ariane Labed is that she doesn't know anything about man till she meets this guy Yorgos Lanthimos (He acutally is a director who made the legendary Greeck movie DOGTOOTH).
The lauch was really strange.
She just becomes naked in front of him since she knew nothing about relationship with man.
But Yorgos was a really nice man and he dresses her back and just kisses her. He wanted to really befriend with her and make this relationship a good one and doesn't want to ruin this relationship till it really blooms.
He adjusts everything into her world.
He does this thing imitating bird wing flocking, monkey sound/behavior with her in his bed but no sex.
It was way later that they finally make love.
It was the time when her father dies when they finally achieve love making.

Ariane fulfulled her first relationship with man and the movie ends that way.

This movie is more of a post modern movie of some sort which is maybe arrived a little too late but still, it was fun to watch.

Ariane Laded was not a sexy woman but more of a lady next door and a pretty charming one to look at.
I think she deserves the next breakthrough.",1464048000,,2322,4.326436781609195

8516572,3,B007HC8E7U,"This is two crazy Greek movies in a row for me.  I'm actually beginning to like the genre of ""crazy Greeks"".  The last one was ""Dogtooth"" (called "","" in Greek).  Again it was about young people who were inexperienced in social behavior lacked much exposure to the outside world.  I think this ""crazy Greek"" theme is actually more about Greece coming of age in the New World.  As Spyros, played by Vangelis Mourikis as Marina's father stated, Greece skipped the industrial revolution.  All young people are coming to grips with a generation that came after the great world wars, has been spoiled very generous socialist governments and as modern members of the world economy are having to pay the price.  Am I the only one seeing these parallels in these movies?",1390867200,,761,4.763358778625954
8516573,4,B007HC8E7U,This movie is a beautiful coming of age story. The young virginal woman is faced with the immanent death of her father and the potential loss of her virginity all in one movie. She is forced to reconcile those emotions and her curiosity. I rather enjoyed the film and felt the actors were believable and genuine.,1376352000,3,312,4.589285714285714
8516574,1,B007HC8E7U,This movie is strange and depressing and terrible. Don't watch it! The subtitles are hard to read and the plot hard to follow. What is this movie really about anyways?,1369785600,,167,4.6
8516575,4,B007HC8E7U,"I recently saw that 2009 film from Greece named Dogtooth, and really liked it. I decided to check out some more movies in the same vein, which lead me to this one (the director of Dogtooth is a co-producer and one of the main acotrs in this one).

""Attenberg"" (2010 release from Greece; 94 min.) brings the story of Marine, a 23 yr. old misfit who feels alienated from everyone and everything. In fact, her only solace seems to be to watch Sir David Attenborough's nature documentaries. Her ""circle"" exists of her best friend Bella (who refers to Sir David as ""Attenberg""), and Marina's dad Styros, an architect whom we later learn has a terminal illness. Marina also gets to know the (nameless) engineer from out of town whom she chauffeurs around and to whom she becomes attracted. To tell you much more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Seceral comments: first and foremost, this is a very touching relationship drama that focuses mostly on the father-daughter, and to a lesser degree on Marina-Bella, and Marina-the engineer. Second, I have never seen Greece depicted in such a grim and gray manner. Surely it is no coincidence that this movie was made as the financial crisis and austerity measures have wrecked havoc (and continue to do so) on Greek society as a whole. Third, this movie confirms that there seems to be a nice pool of young talented writers/directors in Greece. Can't wait to see what director Athina Rachel Tsangari does next. Fourth, the movie uses to great effect several great French songs to underscore the plot, specifically with two Francoise Hardy songs: ""Tous Les Garcons et Les Filles"" (emphasizing Marina's loneliness) and later ""Le Temps de l'Amour"" (giving a glimmer of hope), just great. Last but not least, please do not be put off by the DVD jacket, with that stupid picture of Marina and Bella grasping their whatever (what was the US distributor thinking?? check out instead the original and far better movie poster, it's on the Wikipedia page for this movie). Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""Attenberg"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1360368000,10,2226,4.824607329842932
