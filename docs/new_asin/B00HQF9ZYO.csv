8634212,5,B00HQF9ZYO,I first saw this movie at a film festival.  It realisticly portrays the struggles in a relationship where the boyfriend Byrd is unable to overcome his addiction to drugs and Debbie cannot make ends meet as a waitress.  Byrd  is a well meaning/nice person but the drugs get in the way of him leading a responsible life.  Everyone played their parts well from Byrd to Debbie to Josh the son and the rabbi.  There was not one weak actor.,1398816000,,434,4.443037974683544
8634213,5,B00HQF9ZYO,"Hi, This is a great movie about a young boy and the impact of domestic violence on his life. The Jewish Rabbi really helps him through a difficult time in his young life. The actors are all terrific. The fact that it is based on true life events is even more heartbreaking. It just shows how one can turn their life around when they clean up their act and get centered on what is really important in life.... your children, and then yourself.",1395964800,,442,4.337349397590361
8634214,5,B00HQF9ZYO,"This is one of Andre Royo's best performances in a cast of really great actors telling a truly beautiful story. When we watched it in a packed cinema at Leicester Square London, the audience laughed and cried, they loved it and so do i.

I'm biased of course, i produced this film and i'm very proud of it.",1395705600,2,306,4.275862068965517
