2670566,4,B000JGEXFS,What happens when one sibling is secular+Jewish+agnostic+bisexual+NYC filmmaker and the other is born-again+Christian+straight+farmer in a remote Christian commune in Alaska? That's what this documentary is about -- how to make bridges between loved ones who have diametrically opposed worldviews. The good news is that there *is* common ground from which to sustain relationship and that each sibling is able to offer the other a gentle lesson in how the other half lives.,1264464000,3,473,5.583333333333333
2670567,4,B000JGEXFS,"Director Julia Pimsleur and her brother Marc were raised in a Jewish family. However, when Marc became a born-again Christian, a rift developed, in large part because he moved to an Alaskan farm where his faith was an integral part of life. (At one point, his sister compares the farm to a kibbutz.) Add to this the fact that Julia labels herself as bisexual, and the rift grows.

The film is not so much an attempt to investigate faith (or any faith in particular) as it is the director's attempt to reconcile with her brother. In other words, the primary emphasis is familial, not theological. And yet despite the intimacy of the subject matter, the film is surprisingly calm. Both Julia and Marc treat each other with respect, though not necessarily for their views. That restraint is at times rather frustrating. The civility almost makes it seem as if the two are merely going through the motions. I would have liked to see more emotion.",1231113600,3,942,4.709090909090909

8150310,2,B000JGEXFS,"This is a story about a lesbian sister who feels the need to intercede on her Christian Brothers life.. Although she is never angry at her brother, she does feel the need to try to change his perspective.

The three women his life feel a real need to change his life, when it is clear the young man is genuinely happy.

If the roles were reversed the average American viewer might be outraged.

Not a significant film.",1391212800,2,418,4.402597402597403
8150311,4,B000JGEXFS,"I was very impressed with the way this brother and sister managed to maintain their loving connection in spite of their huge ideological differences.  The film shows Julia, a young woman probably in her late 20's living a very New York lifestyle--atheistic, urban, bi-sexual and....a film maker ---taking a trip to a Christian farm in rural Alaska to make contact with her brother, Marc.  At first it seems there are some irreconcilable differences.  Julia demands that Marc accept her Lesbian lifestyle which he refuses to do.  Julia seems bent on convincing Marc that he is wrong and that he should, at least come back to civilization.  Gradually, though she comes to accept the fact that Marc is happy where he is and that he still loves her as a sister even though their beliefs differ.

There are some lovely shots of the farm.  We see Julia romping in the grass with new born puppies and learning to fish and shoot with Marc.  Throughout the film she engages others as well as Marc in sincere questioning of their beliefs.  She is smart and fierce in her questioning and at the same time open and honest.  I applaud  both of them for the way they confronted one another's beliefs in a respectful way that even became affectionate and humorous.

Later in the film Marc visits Julia and his mother and great aunt in New York.  By this time both Julia and her mother seem to have come around a lot in supporting Marc in doing what makes him happy.

The film ended in a way that honored everyone's choices.  It was truly heartening to see how these people addressed their problems in an open minded way that seemed to bring them all closer together than they had been in a long time.",1370736000,,1685,4.57
8150312,5,B000JGEXFS,"This movie made me laugh cry and clap.  I have lived  both sides of the two main characters, so it was like watching me from two sides of the fence at different times in my life.  I could feel the sisters pain of not understanding and know the pain of the brother wanting her to get her Jesus awakening (that only he can give).  Heartwarming and moving , I liked the real down to earth realness of the whole movie.  I give it 5 out of 5 :)  I prayed for the sister at the end of it, and wondered how many other would pray for her too .  Great movie guys thanks for sharing and giving us a look at the joy and heartache of being a born again believer, amen",1356220800,7,655,3.9166666666666665
8150313,5,B000JGEXFS,I enjoyed the documentary and appreciated the candidness of the sister and brother.  A good exploration into the tension between Jewish and Christian believers in the context of family dynamics.,1329091200,2,194,5.466666666666667
8150314,5,B000JGEXFS,"As a person who has experienced religion in various ways, including as an agnostic & atheist & for the last 41+ years as a born-again believer in Jesus involved quite heavily in ministry & missionary work, I could relate to both the brother & sister & others in this family. Most of my friends in school were Jewish (though I am not) & I have known Jews who have been born again (Messianic Jews) & continue to do so. This film records a very honest attempt by an unbelieving Jewess to understand in a loving, unjudgmental way her brother's radical change in life & loving response & subsequent temporary visit with others in his family. I was blessed by the film & hope it will be used to open the way to further communication & understanding between those who have become part of God's family & those who are not yet.",1303689600,3,818,4.423841059602649
8150315,4,B000JGEXFS,"A Christian is obligated to help a ""sister in Christ,"" but what about a biological sister? That is the question at the heart of the documentary Brother Born Again.

The other night, my infant daughter wouldn't sleep. So I stayed up with her and watched Brother Born Again. The film concerns Julia Pimsleur, a woman from New York City who attempts to reestablish contact with her brother, Marc. The two siblings lost contact after Marc became a born-again Christian and moved into a Christian community called The Farm in rural Alaska. Julia's attempts to reestablish her relationship with Marc are complicated by two facts. First, the Pimsleur family is Jewish. Second, Julia is openly bisexual.

One interesting aspect of the film is that it juxtaposes secular New York City with the ascetic Farm in Alaska. First, the viewer sees Julia discussing her life in New York; then Julia travels to see Marc in Alaska; finally, Marc visits his family in New York. The sharp contrast in these two settings intrigues the viewer.

Marc is an interesting character, but he remains a bit mysterious at the film's end. He explains why he thought that he needed more meaning in his life, but I never understood why fundamentalist Christianity was the path that he chose to follow. Perhaps I am asking too much of the film, however, as religious belief often defies conventional explanations.

A commendable aspect of the film is that while Julia explains her feelings about her brother and the hurt that his absence from her life causes, the film does a good job of not judging either person. This is a difficult task, given the charged topics that the film explores. I liked the fact that the filmmakers respected their viewers enough to allow them to draw their own conclusions. Julia strikes the viewer as someone who earnestly wants a better relationship with her brother and the viewer cheers for her to succeed.

Brother Born Again offers few easy answers as to how we can bridge the gap between religious and secular Americans, but it offers much food for thought and it profiles some likeable people.",1295222400,5,2095,4.857142857142857
8150316,5,B000JGEXFS,This touched me quite deeply.  It spoke to my own struggles with my family accepting my faith and me learning to live with their lack thereof graciously. I loved it!  A really good movie.,1284768000,6,187,4.470588235294118
8150317,4,B000JGEXFS,"Very interesting & different. I was adopted as an infant & raised protestant in a congregational church in New England. My eyes were opened to the born-again lifestyle when I found my biological siblings & mother - all of whom are/were born-again. From my personal experience with my biological family & as seen with Marc, it seems that there is a common thread of severe life challenge/struggle for those who become born-again as adults. In my family's case, they didn't go off and join a cult or life of seclusion. They live & work in regular society & attend local born-again churches. In my view, raising children in a secluded population, as at the Farm seems a bit ""cult-ish"", but raising born-again children among the general population presents a different set of challenges for parents & for the kids as they can be shunned by their peers if not home-schooled. (born-again children are forbidden to read Harry Potter books, for instance) But I'm now off-topic..
I think the most honest line in this documentary comes when Marc returns to NY for a very brief family visit, and his elderly aunt pronounces his new life as ""I think it's crap!""
I was left wondering where Marc is now that it's 10 years later so I just googled his name & found a Marc Pimsleur MD living in Florida. I'd like to think it's the Marc of this film. If it is, I'm betting he's not only competent, but deeply compassionate, which is something very lacking in doctors of today.",1271203200,4,1458,4.655038759689923
8150318,5,B000JGEXFS,"I loved the way this video was put together.  Having lived on the farm at an earlier time, I was aware of the potential for tension between the family members.  Brother and sister did the right thing by meeting face to face.  I saw a postive resolution with mutual love and respect.  It wasn't an easy achievement but appeared genuine.  We don't always understand everything the same but we can still love and appreciate each other.  Plus the scenery was great.  Overall a very satisfying story.",1268524800,10,495,4.686046511627907
