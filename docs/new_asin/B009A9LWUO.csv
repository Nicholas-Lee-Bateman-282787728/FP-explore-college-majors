8538334,5,B009A9LWUO,"In 1943 a special group of army soldiers are tasked to hunt two escaped pumas in Australia. They take with them a large radio which is carried around like the Ark of Covent. We have a long wait for action as we get introduced to the characters that appear to be the campy counterparts from WWII movies.

Private Eli Ishbak (Dan Balcaban) A Jewish kid who wants to be in the movies.

Captain O'Brien (Jim Knobeloch) He was a Hollywood actor before enlisting

Rifleman Roberto Barelli (Angelo Salamanca) An Italian from Brooklyn.

Corporal Haywood Updike (Jak Wyld) He is a country boy who wants to be president. His dad is a senator.

Sergeant Carl Weaver (Serge De Nardo) Has a fake sergeant's voice.

As they get to their destination we discover one of the group works for the OSS and the radio is really a time machine. Their real mission is to go BACK in time and recover a flying saucer that was found buried in the ground and bring it to the present to defeat Hitler.

The film was campy by design and was made to look like a 1950's film (except in color) including the scenery riding by to simulate vehicle movement. While back in time, the animals are a bit larger and pose some problems.

Based on a novella, ""50,000 Years Until Tomorrow"" by J.J. Solomon. This movie is the first part of a series (hopefully) and doesn't give closure.
Good fun for those who enjoy the older Sci-fi classics and don't care too much about special effects.
