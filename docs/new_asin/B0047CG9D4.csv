4284411,4,B0047CG9D4,"I enjoyed the series even though it was a bit melodramatic. I haven't watched series one, but enjoyed this series so much that I have ordered the other set. Definitely plan to watch everything in order as the episodes build on each other. The transisition between episodes and scenes is a little repetitive and I wish that it had played continuously, but appreciate the fact that it was probably made for television and that is how the commercial breaks probably happened. Well done and worth watching.",1305417600,,502,4.848837209302325
4284412,4,B0047CG9D4,I had read the reviews before ordering so I was aware of its inaccuracies. I still found it enjoyable and will get the next installment upon release.,1300492800,,149,4.555555555555555
4284413,5,B0047CG9D4,"Wish Me Luck Series 2 continues the exploits of the members of the SOE agents dropped into France during WW II.  This series is an excellent characterization of life during those years, with rationing, loss of family and friends and women taking on new roles.  Churchill told the SOE to set the world ablaze, and these agents certainly did. The characters are engaging, and action is exciting. The historical significance is outstanding. England was struggling in the War against Germany.  The SOE and their cadre of spies made a huge difference in the War's outcome.  This series is certainly worth the cost and would be a wonderful addition to your DVD collection.",1297987200,4,666,4.919642857142857
4284414,5,B0047CG9D4,"This is very good, it's interesting to see things in history that we never heard about, can't wait until the next one comes out.  You can't find any better period pieces than the ones the British make.
I had not heard of this, but thanks to Amazon sending me emails with things they think I might like, I have discovered many new series that I have never heard of.",1294790400,22,364,4.27536231884058
4284415,5,B0047CG9D4,"SOE thriller, action, suspense, top-notch. British women in the Special Operations Executive branch of the war fought in silence, often leading men, risking all they had, and in the case of these great episodes also finding romance occasionally along the way. But duty also preceeded any romance. Beautiful, but tough women, all taking place in 1943. It's a different part of the allied War on the European Front. Women in strong roles, history (based on real stories), and tense episodes. 7 excellent episodes that do run a continuing story, picked up from the previous season. So good my wife and I could not stop and watched all 7 one after another in a single day, breaks only to fix food.

This series 2 is even better than ""WISH ME LUCK: Series 1"" and could be used alone, but if you've not seen the first, you might want to consider finding both sets. More military/spy action/fighting in this 2nd series. And there surely will be a final coming some day. WISH ME LUCK ran on TV for 3 years. Excellent historically accurate war drama. Fantastic period viewing for 1940s London and France.

Returning cast: HQ-Faith (Jane Asher-Death at a Funeral ,Holby City).....Spy Kit (Michael J. Jackson-The Glory Boys, Mobile).....HQ-Liz (Kate Buffery-Trial & Retribution ).....HQ boss-Cad (Julian Glover-Troy, Star Wars, The Avengers ). Faith & Liz were spies in series one under spy leader Kit, whom one had a relationship with, oops.

Episode details for those interested. Each average 54 minutes.
All have SUBTITLES, the only bonus material.
1
SW France, 1943 and e Brit agents are shot in a public square, no blindfolds, by Nazis. London HQ staffer Liz assigned to inform a widow. 2 new recruits who will lead this series: Nave Emily (Jane Snowden-All Passion Spent , The Frog Prince ) (radio op) and Vivien (Lynn Farleigh-Castles, Pride and Prejudice , Murder Most English-a good DVD!) (the new widow.) Colin Jeremy Northam-Emma, A Village Affair, Gosford Park, Miami Medical) is sent as their Sec. 7 leader. There is romance sparking as agents come and go.

2
Em now Zoe, Viv now Salonge, & Colin now Andrea drop into France. Emily arrives with a difficult surprise. Colin crashes and turns a females head. Kit returns to UK & ordered to take a month off. Kit & Liz dj vu?

3
Colin shoots a girl, Liz questions marriage, Emily opts for more of France, Cad makes some huge decisions about staff.

4
Dissention amid the French resistance force. Liz & Vivien have some difficulty with their present missions. Lots of military raid action.

5
The resistance considers a traitor, informer in their ranks. Nazis find a radio plus further complications cause Cad to take a new look at the team.

6
Brothels make a good hide-out? Interesting new agent `cover.' The team is spread out but all yet survive. Liz & Kit rejoin--but for what purpose? Then HQ command gets news unwanted.

7
Arms factory supplying Germany is planned for attack. The team's exit goes as badly as other Sec. 7 raids; but plenty of action. A great warp for this season of shows. Can't wait for series 3.

Action, Suspense, Romance, World War Two, Spies, Intrigue, 1943 period perfection, Astounding cast, Gripping drama, and women as tough as they are beautiful. It's got it all, blended together, like the forces serving behind enemy lines.
It's like Foyle's War (a must, must see 6 stars) but with women replacing Foyle and the action in France.",1291939200,13,3414,4.830479452054795
4284416,5,B0047CG9D4,"""Wish Me Luck"" has everything a good WWII series should have: interesting characters, suspense, triumph and tragedy, as well as a good dose of realism about the terrible pressures faced at all times by the incredibly brave men and women who went undercover to work with the French Resistance groups.  I only wish that the entire series was available in North America - I have series 1 only - and it's awful to be left hanging without seeing series 2 and 3.  I did see these when ""Wish Me Luck"" was originally shown on TV, but I would like to be able to show this story in its entirety to the younger generation of my family.  I feel that this series is an education for young people, now so far removed from the Second World War.",1287705600,37,729,4.345588235294118

4284425,5,B0047CG9D4,"ww2 england is in dire straits.  they need french speaking, morse code radio operators to communicate with their people in france.

things get worse!  they run short of men for the army.  they recruit or draft women that used to live in france to be operators.

then things get desperate!!! they run short of men operators in france!!!  they start parachuting the women into france.

some of these poor young women aren't good at this.  some of the german secret police are really good at this.

4284436,3,B0047CG9D4,"If you are a fan of Foyle's War, this is probably not the series for you.  The acting seems a bit forced, settings and photography not entirely genuine.  OK for watching while eating supper.",1399161600,,190,4.5588235294117645
4284437,4,B0047CG9D4,"This is a fun series, it gives you a little insight into the world of world war two spy operations and the lives of these people. I enjoyed that it was more than one season so you were able to watch some of the characters develop.",1395360000,,230,4.021739130434782

4284441,4,B0047CG9D4,"Very nostalgic and touching.  The acting is wonderful.  The only problem, probably due to the age of the series, is that the soundtrack is faint and somewhat fuzzy.",1376179200,,164,4.821428571428571
4284442,5,B0047CG9D4,I have watched Season 1 recently and enjoy it thoroughly. Season 2 is a continuation and just as good. We are well into the story now of British intelligence and their underground networks in France helping to prepare the country for the invasion of the allies. There are many good story lines involved here. Much danger and excitement. I highly recommend the series. R. Kirby,1376006400,,376,4.8
4284443,5,B0047CG9D4,"True stories of the brave women who left England to go into France posing as French to spy for England.
The risks were unimaginable for the women and French resistance host families.
While dramatized , the stories are real and of actual women.
Part of the dramatization includes  intwined story lines with which liberties are taken to make the series more watchable.
I HIGHLY recommend this awesome series.",1375315200,,406,4.970588235294118

4284448,5,B0047CG9D4,"Set aside a dark and rainy day and night, heck make it a week end, for the entire series 1,2, and 3.  It may seem long and drawn out at a few points, but ""Gone With the Wind"" had them too. Characters in the field, and at HQ, suffer from the SNAFU's of war, as well as the loss of family. Spy's behind the lines are left in the lurch. HQ personal lied to and made to betray their own. Is not all that not worth your attention ?",1373068800,,426,3.7865168539325844
4284449,4,B0047CG9D4,The assignment of English agents to the French Resistance is the basis for the series.  Plausible WWII backdrops and situations add too what must have been a frustrating time for the multi-faceted decision making that was portrayed by the cast.,1372550400,,244,5.1
4284450,3,B0047CG9D4,Season 1 was outstanding.  Season 2 starts off slow and the charactors  don't seem to be as interesting.  Fourth episode seems to be picking up with Liz back in France.,1372550400,,168,4.533333333333333
4284451,5,B0047CG9D4,Totally enjoyed this presentation and learned quite a bit about the era.  I really  look forward to the third season.,1372291200,,117,4.8
4284452,5,B0047CG9D4,I watched this series with suspense. It delivers the true story of the resistance and British agents in a brilliant way.,1372032000,,120,4.761904761904762
4284453,4,B0047CG9D4,Based on true stories. You never realize the bravery of civilians who risked their lives to help the French resistance until seeing this series based on true stories. Well acted.,1369440000,,178,4.966666666666667
4284454,4,B0047CG9D4,"In terms of being truly at risk - I can't imagine a more genuinely tense mode of living than with the every-day under-your-nose kind of subversive spy work performed by the Resistance. The people who tried to defend their country by remaining within it and working secretly against the evils of the Nazis with the daily realization you could be caught at any moment had to be cool customers. Yet, this show, while brilliantly written, may be slightly too sangfroid for a wider audience. It's nice not having the constant over-the-top Jack-Bauer-style breathless danger at every turn for this kind of piece, but the stiff-upper-lippiness of this wonderful little show undermines the dramatic possibilities. Strong female characters that are interesting are hard to come by. Particularly enjoyed Julian Glover.",1367712000,,808,5.271317829457364
4284455,5,B0047CG9D4,I have seen Season 1 and liked it! Looking forward to the other Seasons.  Liked the time period and the story lines were good.  Recommend it.,1366848000,,141,4.384615384615385
4284456,4,B0047CG9D4,I enjoy historical fiction.  This series is about English spies in occupied France during WWII.  The episodes build as you learn more about both the characters and the situations they were facing.  This is a side of WWII that I had not seen before and adds perspective to the events of the time.  It was interesting to look at events from the British point of view.,1366761600,,365,4.484848484848484

4284461,4,B0047CG9D4,"I first watched this series, Season one, on streaming Netflix. I loved it. Brave women eager to fight Nazis, fight for their country, and help Europe endure and eventually repel Fascist rule. Specifically France, in this case. Acting is typical British high standards, heavy on the stiff upper lip school. Each episode has detailed character development and introduces a new danger or situation that demands you watch the next episode to see what happens next. Beautiful settings, sets, scenery, costumes and vintage machines. I love the big wooden tables with the French loaf and the knife on a cutting board in just about every stone farm kitchen. Female heroines very sympathetic, human failings and fears, very engaging. Nazis were more wily and calculating than crude villains, which made the plot interesting cat and mouse game. So bottom line, I had to have more, more, more. Since Netflix only offered Season 1, I ended up buying Seasons 2 and 3 from Amazon, and that's pretty much all I watched with great enjoyment until I was finished with it all. I'll probably watch it again.",1331424000,3,1088,4.950819672131147

4284463,4,B0047CG9D4,"Tale focuses on the British SOE (Special Operations Executive) who recruit and train British women who have backgrounds that will let them pass as French women in Nazi occupied France during WWII. For those so interested the SOE really existed and was created in 1940 by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Axis and to instruct and aid local resistance movements. The main characters include an aristocratic woman and a factory worker who train together with others and are later sent to the same area of Nazi occupied France to go undercover and gradually gain crucial pieces of information. This series is much more interested in the characters and dialogue, especially how the war wears them down and affects the heads of SOE as well as loved ones back in England. I enjoyed this one more than the first season though the first season was good. They got rid of the jazzy music which didn't feel right during chase scenes. The aristocratic woman (Vivien) who's trained is multifaceted and gives the series a controversial ending. Liz's marriage crumbles and gives her an additional incentive to return to operative work. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; FOCUSES: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: September to October 2011.",1319414400,,1339,5.090909090909091

8417971,3,B0047CG9D4,"I'm am enjoying this series, maybe out of desperation, but boy does it have some serious gaffes.  I don't think I'm giving anything away when I relate them.  These are some pretty lame spies; even the experienced spies from season one are behaving oddly.  Seasoned spy- demands green spies not visit his quarters so blithely, watch in case they are being followed.  Well seasoned spy invites green spy up to his quarters, again, while suspicious character is indeed watching. Then green spy TAKES NOTES!  She of the photographic memory. And just wait for the outcome of seasoned spy's confrontation with the local French german supporting militia. Does seasoned spy panic, seasoned spy who was so calm, cool and collected in season one? Unbelievable!  And accents.  I don't mind at all the English accents coming from French speakers, but Scottish resistance fighter who uses ""lasses"" when referring to the green spies  Is he indeed a Scottish character, hiding out in the French forest?  Oh, well, managing to enjoy it still, but kind of wishing I had better taste.",1479945600,,1066,4.977401129943503
