8627501,5,B00GTXDMG6,This is one of the best methods I have seen out there to make a Topsy turkey cake. It is easy to follow and just awesome! I have used carrie's technique and my friends were amazed that the cake had such a fun design while still very stable and beautiful.  I also love it because it made topsy-turvy simple with no need to buy extra pans and materials.  Awesome!,1405987200,,361,4.217391304347826
8627502,5,B00GTXDMG6,"These cakes are great to look at, but very scary to make and transport, however Carrie makes it all seem so simple in this great instructional DVD.  Her method of making the tilted layers, construction and final transport help even the novice baker have success with these zany cakes.  Loaded with lots of extra helps and ideas for decorating, this DVD gives extra confidence to the cake-maker.  I never thought that I could make such a spectacular cake, and Carrie has given me the ability to do just that!  This is a fantastic addition to my ""How-to"" library.",1387670400,,561,4.6938775510204085
8627503,5,B00GTXDMG6,"I bought 2 of these dvds for my wife and she has watched them several times and is loving learning how to make cakes.  Shes now making cakes for everyone in our extended family.  Excellent video and let's be honest, I get to eat her leftover cakes.",1387065600,5,248,4.25531914893617
