6126872,4,B00H2FPY20,"Amazing Spider-Man 2 is about Peter (Andrew Garfield) trying to date Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) despite Captain Stacey asking him not to. The image of Gwen's dad everywhere he goes and the promise he made; hurts their relationship. The fact that she might go to a University in England doesn't help.

  While Peter's old friend Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) finds he has a genetically passed disease and wants Peter to get Spider-man's blood for a cure. And of course you have Max Dillion (Jamie Foxx) who worships Spider-Man. When he becomes Electro after a lab accident; anger fills him that he's hated and not loved like Spider-Man. So he becomes a super-villain of course.

 That's about it story wise. It's not the strongest script ever but Peter and Gwen is a much stronger relationship than Peter and MJ in all 3 Raimi films. When Peter and Gwen argue, it makes sense. Gwen isn't just being a jealous you know what; like MJ in Spider-man 3. While DeHaan is a much better Harry Osborne than James Franco. And Jamie Foxx really sucks in the beginning as Max Dillion but makes a pretty menacing and awesome Electro.

  I just felt the film was overly hokey at times with some bad pacing. For instance after a fight with Electro, Peter suddenly finds it's time to do research about his father's death again. Oh and Dillion being a nerd who's a fan of the hero but turns bad when he feels betrayed by that hero is cliche. We already saw that in Batman Forever and Iron Man 3.

  Last but not least, a Spider-Man film is missing part of it's soul with no Jonah Jameson!  We just hear Peter talk about pictures he has taken. JJ himself could have been used for comic relief. Still, I'd recommend Amazing Spider-Man 2 over Spider-Man 3 any day! Has more romance, balances three villains better and has a heart felt ending.",1398211200,9,1817,4.574074074074074
6126873,5,B00H2FPY20,"Growing up a massive comic book fan, Spider-Man was always the superhero that I found myself following and relating to more than any other.  Spideys playful personality, filled with humorous quips and charming banter, showcases his endless charismatic potential. Throw in his wall crawling ability, unique Spidey sense, and fearless web-slinging, and you have the make-up of a character that any kid can admire.  But, outside of being Spider-Man, there has consistently been a soap opera-like appeal to the unique love life of Peter Parker, beginning with his on-again, off-again relationship with that innocent-looking blonde girl  Gwen Stacy.  But, just when their 1970s romance started to fully blossom, tragedy stuck and ripped it all away.  Now, that fateful moment is in serious danger of repeating itself (in cinematic fashion) during the highly anticipated sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) returns to the directors chair for the comic book sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2  starring Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy.  Little has changed since we last saw the web-slinger as he continues to thwart the efforts of criminals, while balancing the life of a typical teenager.  However, Peter is still unable to ignore the promise he made to Gwens late father, Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary), and struggles with whether or not to maintain a relationship with his high school sweetheart.

Meanwhile, an Oscorp electrical scientist, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), has his own struggles  mainly being treated as an insignificant employee.  However, an unfortunate accident changes everything when he obtains the power to feed off and control electricity.  At the same time, Peters old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns to tend to his ailing father, Norman (Chris Cooper), only to be informed that he too is suffering from the inherited degenerative disease thats slowly killing his father.

The dark secrets of Oscorp know no bounds, engulfing the lives of not only the Osborn family, but also Peters family, too  intertwining with the ultimate fate of his parents, Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz).  As Peter continues to dig into the past workings of his father, he eventually learns that the blood of Spider-Man might be the key to saving Harrys dwindling health.  Unfortunately for Spider-Man, the duo of new foes, the Green Goblin and Electro, simply decide its easier to take his blood by force  which could have a devastating impact on the lives of both Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy.

In case you didn't notice from the synopsis, theres a whole lot going on throughout the course of this sequel, though easily highlighted by the wonderful chemistry between the films stars (and real life couple), Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.  Naturally, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy are thrust into an impossible situation that (if you read the comics) led to the heart-wrenching demise of Gwen Stacy (though, youll have to watch the movie to learn Gwen s cinematic fate).  Regardless, the complexity of maintaining a relationship is a major part of Spider-Mans allure, yet I cant help but think that only diehard comic book readers will buy into this films romance between Gwen and Peter, which feels stiffly rushed and occasionally melodramatic.  Still, their struggle between sensibility and love has this comic reader fully invested in their ill-advised passion.

Getting back to the acting, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are proving they are each the right choice for their respective roles.  Honestly, Garfields portrayed as Spider-Man is far superior than anything Toby Maguire accomplished with the character, but thats not a knock on Toby  but rather the difference in character development attributed to the scriptwriters.  Although, as enjoyable as Garfield is in the role of Spidey, Emma Stone is relentlessly more delightful and quickly steals his spotlight in each and every scene.  And, while were briefly on the subject of the Sam Raimi trilogy, it should be noted that Dane DeHaan swiftly and superbly removes any remnants of that Franco guy.  Still, whoever takes on the future role of Mary Jane Watson (and it looks as though it will not be Shailene Woodley), they will be hard-pressed to outshine Kirsten Dunst.

While Spider-Man receives the greatest amount of attention, the series villains garner their own amount of rightful attention.  For fans, The Lizard was a far cry from an outstanding antagonist in the first film, and Jamie Foxx, for all his previous accolades, does little to provide any substantial or additional interest as the superfluous villain, Electro (whos origin annoyingly resembles that of The Riddlers in Batman Forever).  The insignificance of Electro is pinpointed in the fact that the writers deemed it necessary to add a second villain, the Green Goblin  who was figuratively abused to no end in the previous trilogy.  Unfortunately, this movie, like an abundance of other superhero films, is burdened with one too many bad guys.  Personally, the Green Goblin could have at least taken on the role of the underutilized Spider-villain, the Hobgoblin.  Instead, he we are helplessly stuck in the middle of another Osborn-centric storyline.

Due to the brief incorporation of several new characters (like Paul Giamatti as Rhino and Felicity Jones as Felicia Hardy), along with attempting to find something to do with the old ones (like Sally Fields Aunt May), the plot is seriously jumbled at times.  The incorporation of Peters parents is an element that didn't necessarily need to be explored again, and their repeated inclusion clearly steals screen time from other noticeably absent supporting characters (its a crime J. Jonah Jameson and the Daily Bugle are nowhere to be found  other than via email).  Obviously, if the Spider-Man franchise is going to continue down this crowded path, hopefully some of these minor characters are allotted time in the upcoming Spidey spin-offs (reportedly Venom and the Sinister Six, thus far).

Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a welcome addition to the franchise.  Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are worth the price of admission alone, plus there are plenty of superhero antics and action sequences to boot.  Sadly, its difficult to escape the sadness thats required to make Spider-Man the loveable character weve all come to cherish.  With great power comes great responsibility - a motto that Peter Parker (in comics and on screen) is destined to learn the hard way.  However, the conclusion of this sequel  for better or worse  lays the groundwork for future installments, all of which appear to be primed for success.  By no means is this a perfect sequel, and it will rightfully warrant its fair share of complaints, but the positives supremely outweigh the negatives, making this a summer blockbuster thats not to be missed.

6126898,5,B00H2FPY20,"Andrew Garfield gets a bad rap for his portrayal of Peter Parker. I think his take on Parker is a nice dichotomy from Toby McGuire's much beloved version. The movie is good, and Jamie Foxx is ""electric"" as Electro. His take on Sparky makes a sometimes comical villain in Spidey's Rogues Gallery into a credible and dangerous threat. I think the rush to bring in Green Goblin took away from Electro's time to shine and was not as menacing as Willam Defoe's Norman Osborn version. Other comic stories that the pushed through that I won't mention because of Spoilers, were premature and didn't really let the story unfold as naturally as it could have. The set up for a potential Sinister Six movie was very evident and the movie may have been good but I guess we'll never know.",1516406400,3,775,4.58273381294964

6126921,2,B00H2FPY20,"I finally watched Amazing Spider-Man 2.  After Amazing 1 I just couldn't bring myself to watch the sequel.  It took me three years to force myself to do it, and it took me two different sittings to finish.  SOOOO BOOOORRRIIIING AND DUUUUUMB.

My wife kept asking me to check how much time was left.  Every ten minutes.  I had to encourage her to soldier on like a coach for a marathon runner.  Come on, you can do this.  Keep on moving.  Stay strong.  Unfortunately our brains started cramping up and we had to stop for a breather.

Best theory I've heard on how this movie ended up so disjointed and sloppy, ""It's like some intern was taking five different scripts to a producer and he tripped and all the pages went everywhere, so he just started grabbing pages and shoving them together...and they filmed the results.""

How else do you explain the sloppy tonal transitions, the five different plot lines, plots that go nowhere, motivations that come out of nowhere, the Twilight level stalker-esque love story where he dumps her, hooks back up with her, dumps her, sees her ghost dad, hooks back up with her, magic blood, super mega death virus, brooding teen angst plot, secret spy dad plot that just kind of...stops, and a villain who was supposed to be heavily featured getting 2 minutes of screen time before ""fade to black credits,"" which is one of the hackiest art film student tropes in modern film making?

These are good actors.  They deserve so much better than whatever this pathetic excuse of a first draft was.  And they deserve better than director Marc Webb.  His directing credits are mostly music videos, and wow does it show.  It was like he couldn't remember what kind of movie he was supposed to be making for longer than it took to get a single scene shot.  I never thought Id say this, but this movie makes Spider-Man 3 look great.  At least in that movie there was some charm and you could tell what was going on, even if it was hokey and bloated.

But watching this jumbled ADHD experiment was cathartic.  I now no longer have to fear having my hopes dashed by Spider-Man Homecoming, because my expectations cannot get any lower.  This was immersion therapy, dunking me into the shark tank to face my fears, and now that I have seen Amazing Spider-Man 2, no other Spider-Man movie can faze me.

So thank you, Marc Webb, because there is no way Homecoming can be as bad as this.  I am a battle hardened Spider-Man movie warrior at this point.  Come at me Homecoming.  Show me what youve got.",1507161600,,2517,4.55011135857461

Dane DeHaan played an intensely malicious Goblin. Spiderman has always been my favorite superhero since I grew up watching the cartoon in the 90s. I think Andrew Garfield and this version has been the best. Again, the relationship Gwen and Peter have carries and tugs firmly at your heartstrings. The ending is brilliant, albeit sad; it perfectly depicts and manifests the tragic hero identity that makes Spidey the most compelling comicbook hero in my opinion. Definitely one of my favorite movies. P.S. The new Spiderman Homecoming absolutely stinks.",1499817600,3,863,5.352941176470588
6126942,3,B00H2FPY20,"Released in 2014 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" stars Andrew Garfield as the troubled, but likable hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and battles Electro (Jamie Foxx), a humble electrical engineer transformed into a living electric generator. Dane DeHaan is also on hand as Harry Osborn, who has a startling transformation of his own. Sally Field plays Aunt May while Felicity Jones appears as Felicia.

It's best to watch the first film before this one because some story elements transfer over. It features the same main cast and has the same tone, so if you liked that one you'll probably like this sequel. Thankfully, they fixed Spider-Man's costume, noticeably the mask & eyes. While I like the mature, sometimes reverential tone, the story feels listless, particularly the part revolving around Electro (which is thoroughly changed from the comics). Foxx is fine; I just found the character, as written, uninteresting. Ditto with the other convoluted subplot. DeHaan works better as the second villain (I'm not going to say who, but it's obvious if you know anything about Spider-Man).

Thankfully, everything perks up in the final act where the creators do something bold. I didn't think they'd do it and found it almost shocking, although they didn't milk it for it's potential (but they did well enough). Even the Rhino shows up.

The movie runs 142 minutes and was shot in New York (The City, Rochester & Long Island) and Los Angeles. WRITERS: Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci & a couple others.

I guess he just had to sink in a bit.  Either way.  I really enjoyed the story other until Gwen died at the end.  But the fighting sequences and all the other on screen action was well done.

If you don't own a house then sell a kidney. Then buy Spider-Man 2, then watch the best movie ever, if you don't have time to watch 2 1/2 hour movies then quit your job or break up with your fianc. Then tell everyone you know to demand to see rotten tomatoes bank statements and checks from Disney Marvel deposits. They must be the ones with lots of zeros because I don't think I've seen a good captain America movie and I own all of them. None of them are 1/4 as good as this film. Disney marvel is garbage. Sony #1..

Bring Andrew Garfield back as another superhero!! The guy is incredible! Same with Gwen Stacy!

Now it's time for me to go write a bad review on a certain organic Mac n cheese that's manufactured in china which is giving me mucus. And while your at it, check the labeling on your food products and don't eat anything with the word ""natural flavors"" or ""spices"" written. It's a way for food companies to secretly put toxic substances in your body which is why you've been so irritable and depressed lately. You can thank me later.

6127033,2,B00H2FPY20,"I'll start by saying that Spiderman was originally filmed by Sony using 35mm which transferred nicely into the UHD format. That being said it's going to look great on any hd screen. However this Amazon video version is NOT UHD. It is actually HDR 1080p.

So if you have a 4k tv like I do you'll get a picture I would describe as good but it won't be any better than watching a standard Blu-ray disc. The television itself should show you what resolution is being streamed. Mine automatically switches to my customized HDR when an HDR source is detected. What shows up is HDR 1080p.

All of my other 4k streams show up as 2160p. Netflix, YouTube and others are sharp and show a clear upgrade from 1080p. Amazon UHD? No. They should reupload their source material. Refine it in someway. Or just stop saying its UHD for advertising purposes because that just isn't the case.",1477008000,,871,4.54140127388535

Jamie Foxx did a great job with what he was given, but what he was given isn't much. He plays a misunderstood and unappreciated engineer at Oscorp who falls into a vat of genetically engineered electric eels to become Electro. He feels misunderstood, so that somehow makes him angry enough to become a supervillain. His fights with Spiderman are pretty good, although the motivations doesn't always make sense, and he's way overpowered. In the comics, Electro is supposed to shoot lightning. Period. In this movie, Electro can shoot lightning, fly, move objects with his lightning bolts, dematerialize, and travel through electrical cables. But with all his power, Electro didn't really have anything to do with it, expect follow around Harry Osborn.

What happened to Peter's parents? Finally, the movies answered that question. But the answer is disappointing. Not much, it turns out.

Andrew Garfield did an amazing job as Peter Parker and Spiderman. I'm sorry to see him go, even though he was a bit too old (a teenager shouldn't have wrinkles around his eyes).

What they did to Green Goblin and Harry Osborn in this movie is baffling. In this movie, he has a genetic disorder that causes him and his father to have green skin and grow their nails into claws. Apparently. Harry tries to cure himself, and somehow decides the spider venom in Spiderman's blood will cure him. He gets angry and yells. Spiderman won't give him the blood for vague reasons, and Harry gets angry for good reason. Then Harry injects himself with spider venom, which somehow transforms him into a goblin, and climbs into a suit of armor conveniently nearby...and something like the Green Goblin emerges.

But that's a fail. If we hadn't already seen Green Goblin and known what he was supposed to look like and do, Osborn's transformation would have made no sense. He flies on a glider that sort of looks like a bat, but not really. He throws orange pumpkin bombs. But he's never actually called the Green Goblin. As a reboot, it was kind of a clever redesign to make his actual face change into something like the mask. But why did his hair turn into the goblin's hat? And his skin isn't really green. That's half the name, people. Besides that, he just shows up in the very end to fight Spiderman.

Neither Green Goblin or Electro actually has any kind of plan, so they don't make good villains. They just kind of wander around the movie. In the end, there's a big ""to be continued"" which leaves us going, ""That was it?""

The subplots are even worse. Aunt May wants to be a nurse, for some reason. Peter finds out what his parents were doing, but it doesn't really add up to much, considering the build-up. Also, the amount of buildup for Rhino is criminal when he only shows up in the last few minutes, and we don't even get to see him fight Spiderman. I mean, come on, the fight was even teased in the commercials.

Really, the only reason this movie existed was to set up a cinematic universe that never ended up being made, making the whole movie kind of pointless. There's some good fight scenes and some romance, but it doesn't add up to anything good.",1470873600,4,3390,4.714527027027027

6127080,2,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to be fair, may not be an entirely bad movie just based on the concept. Generally speaking, the movie was intended to open up the Sony  Spider-Man cinematic universe, similar to Fox's X-Men series and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is an admirable goal and idea, but this movie tried so hard to chart a course and establish so many other things for this giant planned universe that it forgets that it's supposed to be a sequel to the first movie and not just a torrent of ideas being presented to set up future movies. The movie takes place sometime after the first movie, a specific amount of time isn't mentioned if I recall correctly. Peter and Gwen have graduated from high school and their lives are wide open now for them to make the most out of them. However, a new threat arises in the form of Max Dillon (Electro) and an old face from Peter's past emerges. Peter must make some of the most important choices of his life as his greatest battle begins. With a premise like that, what could go wrong? Too many plots and subplots, as I mentioned before, that undersell characters and result in to much time being devoted to specific characters, particularly the old ones, and not enough time taken to develop the new characters. This results in a very incoherent story that pops back into play occasionally to remind you of the bigger scheme of things.....to me, that's not an ideal way to tell a story. In the process, the movie is still very confused as to what it really is. It is definitely a superhero movie but what else? It has romance, it has action, it has some interesting drama and intrigue/mystery but all of these things are thrown at the audience so much and so quick that you can't really understand what the movie really is at  it's core. Without giving away too much, the movie has way too many villains very similar to Spider-Man 3 in that regard. The movie has a very impressive cast, one of which is Paul Giamatti who plays the Rhino, one of Spider-Man's iconic villains......yet he gets literally less than five minutes of screen time and his performance is absolutely terrible. Another cast member who is just lacking is Jamie Foxx as Electro. Foxx plays the quirky Max Dillon, who doesn't have enough time for you to even remotely begin to empathize with, and then he turns into the growling, grunting electric villain. Lastly, Dane DeHaan as the Green Goblin was a very strange performance that was obviously thrown into the movie abruptly and unnecessarily. DeHaan was great as Harry Osborn, but when he begins his descent into madness his performance gets very quirky and campy, save for moments of desperation and pain that he conveys very well, it's just when he's trying to be menacing it doesn't really pan out. Also, Aunt May is just an after thought in this movie, which is very strange since she is one of the most important characters in Peter's life, but I guess that's what happens when you have too much going on in the movie. There were some things in the movie that  are kind of a mixed bag. Spider-Man is of course a comedic character at times, but the comedy in this movie was very off and was a hit-or-miss situation, some things were kind of funny, others.....well, maybe they were trying a bit too hard. Hans Zimmer actually scored this movie, but he had a large team of collaborators, while I actually prefer Hans Zimmer's music and enjoy it, his collaborators have different views and understanding and styles when it comes to music so it leads to some very strange themes and tracks. One of which involved someone muttering a phrase over the music almost like a singer saying lyrics and not singing lyrics, but even then, it wasn't to my liking and was just weird. The movie also borrows heavily from various Spider-Man story lines, while the film does a good job integrating them into the story, sometimes it just feels like Webb and the writers were just rushing to be the first to present a certain iconic Spider-Man moment on screen.  But Spider-Man's costume in the movie improved dramatically from the last movie, though it still looked slightly odd. But there are plenty of good things in the  movie. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still amazing as Peter and Gwen, they may not exactly be close to their comic book counterparts but as a theatrical interpretation it isn't bad. The movie explains more about Peter's parents which I enjoyed and still think there was more mystery there that writers could still play around with, which I enjoy. The film continues to do a great job portraying a younger Peter Parker and if the series would have continued it would be interesting to see Peter's evolution into a college student and later, perhaps, a scientist or whatever the plan was. The film also continues to use Oscorp as this shady, evil corporation which I very much liked as well as the reclusive small glimpse at Norman Osborn, I wanted to know so much more about him, but the film already had so much going on. Dane DeHaan was great as Harry Osborn, as I mentioned, but not good as a villain. The make up and special effects were very good as well, specifically the brutality of Max Dillon's death and transformation into Electro. My final verdict on the movie is that overall it isn't a great movie to me, but there's plenty of things in it that you could enjoy, the film suffers from too many pieces moving on the board and nothing coherent and structured. Maybe my views on the movie would change if  more movies were made and I could see the Sony Spider-Man movie series that was planned.",1468713600,4,5591,4.619718309859155

6127097,1,B00H2FPY20,"One of the most fundamentally broken comic book movies of the 21st century, it's a mystery of how The Amazing Spider-man 2 was able to be released in the state that it's in. So the characterisation that was established in the previous film is pretty much dead, as is the tone, as is the entire vision, swapped out for a by-the-numbers board meeting turned sentient and put to screen. Like watching a ticklist of things Avi Arad felt people needed to see in order for the film to be marketable.

The action takes a back seat so that we can feel like a third wheel while we watch Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone tongue each other in the most contrived love story in a comic book movie.

No, Peter doesn't dance on any tables at a jazz club but he doesn't do any of the cool stuff he did in Spider-man 3 either.",1466380800,,807,4.26797385620915

Anyway, this movie continues in the same vein as the first one.  The bad guy(s) were only ok, I thought.

I'm having a hard time saying much about it because my overall impression was kind of ""meh.""  I mean, it was a painless way to spend a few hours and I was happy to buy it.  I would be happy if more movies were as good as this one, but it's not super memorable.",1466035200,,659,4.007692307692308

Garfield is better at his second go-round as Spidey, though the villains in this installment are nowhere near as interesting as the Lizard from the first movie.  Dane DeHaan gives a workable performance as Harry/Green Goblin, though he appears creepy from his first scene on.

6127155,4,B00H2FPY20,"I honestly feel that this movie perfectly captures SPIDERMAN ... in its first half hour.  That first half hour is FLAWLESS.  That is the SPIDERMAN I've always envisioned.  The one that saves the city, saves kids, and has that snappy patter!  Then it starts going downhill.  Electro is okay but the Green Goblin is a disaster.  He looks terrible... nothing like the comic.  Why did they need to bring in two bad guys?  They could have just focused on Electro and expanded that storyline.  And brought back the Goblin in the third film... which would have afforded them the time to really do him well.  They tried to achieve too much and it ended up as something less than what it could have been.

All in all, Andrew Garfield is awesome as the hero.  So was the actress playing Gwen.  Sad to see them go.",1459900800,,803,4.455172413793103

There are a few fixes that would make this movie better, I wish they would take a blow torch to the parents subplot. If not something resembling a rewriting of how that subplot affects Peter in this movie. The strength of this movie to me comes in the form of Peter and Gwen. Every moment Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are on screen together it is great. Some of that magic gets lost in the mess of stories that weigh this film down with too many stories to tell. But despite it's shortcomings I truly enjoy this movie. Spider-Man is a great character, his humanity gives the outlandish nature of his stories power. This movie could have been great, I wish there was a story editor that could have pulled back some of the useless bits but as it stands this movie is just good. Good is better than the alternative I guess. I enjoy this film, I watch it over and over, warts and all.",1457827200,,945,4.284916201117318
6127175,5,B00H2FPY20,"I haven't seen a lot of reviews about people comparing 4K UHD Blu Rays to regular 1080p Blu Rays, is it worth the upgrade, will you notice a difference, and so on. So I figured I do my own little test and see if I can notice a difference.
Unless you have a high end HDR 4K TV, like the JS9500 or LG's OLED then don't expect a huge difference in picture quality. I have the 55HU8550 with the 2015 UHD Evolution Kit, so technically my TV supports HDR but since it's edge lit it can't fully claim to be HDR because my LEDs aren't bright enough to display it.
Also thing to note and this is purely based on what Cnet.com said, that some movies aren't a true 4K conversion. What Cnet.com said was that some are doing 2K resolutions, upscaling that and then downloading them on the Blu Ray. So technically, it's 4K but it's not a true 4K picture. It's hard to tell which movies are those, my gut tells me it's he older movies that some how are on 4K UHD Blu Ray. Like Hancock or Salt, I have a feeling those are 2K to 4K movies. The newer ones I can trust to be 4K.

Now, do I notice a difference... Yes. The picture is a little more sharper and detailed, the color is a lot more accurate and pop more than the 1080p. The sound is also a lot better as well, but only get the benefit if you have a good home theater system. Those with sound bars, and use TV speakers won't get the full experience.
HDR I can't talk about because I can't test it out without owning one of Samsung's Nano Crystal TVs, my TV doesn't have the wide color gamut, it's not a quantum dot TV, and like I said before it doesn't fully support HDR. However, comparing it to my 1080p blu Ray I can tell it can't compete with 4K.
The one thing I don't like about this change, is that they will not be doing 4K 3D movies (as of now at least) and that 4K movies won't even come with a 3D 1080p option. Instead, it will be 4K and a 1080p Blu Ray and if you wanted a 3D Blu Ray you would have to spend another $20 just to have the option. I don't exactly like that change, I would have preferred to have the 3D option and would pay a little more as well if they had included it.

So is it worth the upgrade, I think so only if you have more of a higher end TV. If you don't have a higher end 4K TV, then it may or may not be worth it at the moment. Like I don't expect a 4K Vizio to really show a dramatic difference between 1080p upscaling and a 4K image or that of any other off brand 4K TV, even like a cheaper 4K TV of a good brand.
I think it's a good investment if you have a good 4K TV, and it's on you if you want to buy a 4K player and movies for your TV if you don't have a higher end model. Before you do buy a 4K player, just make sure your TV is HDCP 2.2 and HDMI 2.0 compatible, without HDCP your TV will never be able to display a 4K image and there's nothing much you can do about it.",1457740800,3,2858,3.8837606837606837

Just over all bad casting, story and movie basically. Not as bad as last fantastic four but the other companies that have the comics rights to certain characters are going to keep pumping out the movies if they are good or not because marvel is killing it making awesome movies.

All around, this movie was more developed and interesting than the first in the series. I still prefer the personality of the Raimi movies, but this one won me over with its humanity and energy, and it made me want to see more from this Spider-world--which is not going to happen anymore because this one didn't go so well overall with audiences.

6127257,2,B00H2FPY20,"Yes its pretty bad. The great tragedy is that the cast is for the most part, great. Andrew Garfield really understands the character of Peter/Spider Man and the supporting cast are perfect. Yet the film fails because there is no consistent tone. In Sonys rush to create a shared universe franchise they forgot to make a compelling film.

6127286,1,B00H2FPY20,"I was looking forward to this but, oh what a chore. Too many characters, too many villains, and far too much sappy romance when, to be honest, most folks know what's going to happen at the end (not just comic fans, and not just Film Studies 101 students who happened to miss the labored foreshadowing that weighs on this film like the Rhino...) The character dialog is just labored and, to be honest, do people go to 3D slug-fest super-hero films like this to get mired in the details of interpersonal relationships and old friends and yadda yadda, or do they want to see a majority of the film with Spidey spinning around and doing cool stuff?  Sure, we all do!

The CGI is heavy, the story plodding, the music lousy, and, since the ending was so predictable that it was just an exhaustive experience to get to that point. I will give the film credit for the bright Spidey costumes (in a day and age of dingy Superman hues) and the New York settings, much like the first film, were very immerse, but ultimately this wasn't enough. I couldn't foresee sitting through this film again.
And did the producers mean to hire a Harry Osborne that looked like an anemic version of the kid from Terminator 2? Even worse, when he transformed the effect was unintentionally hilarious... he looked like a frenzied Muppet!

And enough with the 3D-only effects for the benefit of the 3D viewers... it really stinks when you're home watching it in 2D. You just sigh as the slow-mo sequences intended to dazzle the 3D audiences feel slow and contrived as they DON'T pop out of the screen.",1442016000,3,1572,4.567375886524823

6127312,5,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was very good, especially love the 3D version of it, people say why remake Spider-Man but the truth is demonstrated in the film. First, the Spider-Man Trilogy with Toby, never explained his origin nor any glimpse of it, the action was very well made. For Amazing Spider-Man 2 was more of a supernatural-flood of action, much stylized action of an iconic spider from the image of a man. Visually adventures in the web slings, with a 3 dimensional view from slow-to-fast motion. Electro they've made very intense visual supernatural power, wasn't boring, and can tell money was really put into it. Green Goblin was alot more comic like, portrayed to be more evil and furious, you'd think they did a lot more better in make-up for the Green Goblin, much more evil looking and furious in thought. One said moment in the end of the film but want tell you'll the story of that but this film portrayed the beginning of all the chaos to come, hate to disappoint anyone but Rhino is briefly shown, only Green Goblin and Electro were the main competitors in this film, the media said it was suppose to be longer but Sony cut some of the action for the next film, but I definitely look forward to the next one. The difference with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to the Spider-Man 1 & 2 is there was a lot of romance storyline in Spider-Man 1 & 2  but not in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 for there's more action and smiles. Not everyone will think this Spider-Man film is better than the old one, but I vouch for this one more than the old one.",1438732800,4,1547,4.46643109540636

6127324,2,B00H2FPY20,"A confused, overstuffed follow-up effort that's strangely empty, given the classic stories inside. ASM2 plays like a very good, well-intentioned script that was watered down and padded by too many cooks in the producers' kitchen. That leads to a rough, inconsistent tone, which often parades directly from one plucky bit of light banter straight into a dark, brooding, heavy plot development, then back again. Imagine if Adam West's Batman had rounded a corner in the 1960s and stumbled into Jack Nicholson's Joker parade from the first Tim Burton movie.

It's a wasted effort from Andrew Garfield, who's as close as we've had to a perfect rendition of the wisecracking Spidey everyone knows from the comics. His rendition of Peter Parker could still use some work, feeling a bit too ""bro"" for me, but a strong, essential bond with Emma Stone - his Gwen Stacy - smooths over most of those ruffles. Jamie Foxx is a puzzling choice as his main foil, too, in a limp-wristed role that's more pitiable than fearsome. Still, they march him out to a climactic fight scene, which rings as hollow and meaningless as the rest of his arc. More wasted acting chops.

The film can be a visual treat, especially when we're sailing through the skies on a zipline and Spidey's contorting his body into all manner of inhuman poses, ripped straight from the glossy covers. During the heat of battle, though, heavy doses of strobe, shakycam and jump-cuts can make it downright painful to keep up. I wanted to like this much more than I actually did. In all sorts of ways, it feels so much more authentic and grounded than the four efforts that came before, but it tries to do too much, drastically changing speeds and moods far too often. Let's start over again, I guess.",1437955200,,1752,4.759868421052632
6127325,1,B00H2FPY20,"The second one of the two is much worse! Neither of them match up to the original Spider-Man trilogy. Almost every single thing is CG and rhino gets like 5 minutes of screen time, which is total bs because when they were advertising the film and behind the scenes it looked like Paul Giamatti was going to have a larger role in the film. I wouldn't waste your time unless you really loved the first one. To me Spider-Man just seems to do things so effortlessly and it makes it very uninteresting.",1437868800,2,496,4.4021739130434785

6127339,3,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spiderman 2
 The Amazing Spiderman 2 lives up to its title in two important respects.  In respect number one it has some truly beautiful effects.  One of the two villains in the picture is called Electro (played by Jamie Foxx).  He shoots bolts of electricity from his hands.  It reminded me of the sort of visual display that we might get in the old days of Cinemax when the aim was to show eye pleasing film rather than a coherent story.  Electro starts out as a Casper Milktoast sort of guy who gets transformed into an electrical creature with awesome powers, megalomania and a thirst for revenge on Spiderman.  Foxx does well enough and the slashes of energy are quite nice.
 The other amazing aspect of the film that concerns us is the amazing amount of money-estimates range all the way to and past $250 million-spent to make the film and the minimal emotional reward the audience receives for this giant spending spree.  If anything we hate Spiderman/Peter Parker by the end of the film for his Hamlet like indecisiveness.  Spiderman is famously conflicted about his powers, his role in society and his responsibility to his loved ones.  In The Amazing Spiderman 2 he very nearly reduces himself to psychic inertia.
 For a giant special effects film it works.  People in Mumbai and Ankara will find the special effects enough to make even the insane budget justified.  Special effects do not make a film enjoyable for a more sophisticated audience.
 The cast does what they can, and that is a lot.  Paul Giamatti has a supporting role as a bombastic Russian bad guy, a street level hood.  He plays it up to and over the top.  Giamatti rarely has a chance to play a character from a comic book and he takes full advantage of his opportunity.  Foxx, with a similar chance, plays it down giving his character more realism and depth.  Felicity Jones is wasted in a tiny role with nothing to contribute.  And get this tragic error---spoiler alert----One of the most adorable actresses working today is Emma Stone.  She adorably plays Peter Parkers girlfriend.  They have ups and downs because of Spidermans inner inability to make up his mind.  All the time we root for the kids to find a way to be happy.  And then the writers kill Emma Stone!!!  What were they thinking?
 Dane DeHaan is creepy and nuts as the other villain, the Green Goblin which suits his character.  Poor Andrew Garfield is happy or sad or conflicted more or less at random.  His lines were written for him, not his fault.  We remember him as Eduardo Saverin from The Social Network where he did just fine as a brilliant young billionaire in training.
 It may be that the Spiderman franchise is just running out of steam.  Director Mark Webb did much better in making an interesting film with The Amazing Spiderman than this sequel.  And he made a really excellent film with cab fare money with the 2009 low budget winner 500 Days of Summer.  You might rent 500 Days of Summer to prove to yourself that Webb does know how to make a movie with characters that you can give a hoot about.
 The writing team has done better in the past.  Writers Ales Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have co-written a sting of famous films.  Their best work, Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness is absolutely first rate.  The Island, The Legend of Zorro and Mission: Impossible III are interesting or at least watchable.  Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen most closely resembles The Amazing Spiderman 2.  Both films are late franchise entries with plenty of special effects and not so much of a story we can care about.  But even the Hindenburg size budget of The Amazing Spiderman 2 might well turn a profit.  The total of North American and overseas box office gross has climbed to a hearty $369 million.
 The Amazing Spiderman 2 has a tame PG-13 rating and runs for two hours and 22 minutes.  This is the kind of summer time film that you might consider if you live in Phoenix and you want to get out of the 115 degree heat for a while.",1437264000,,4007,4.590973201692525

The Green Goblin transition makes way more sense than the priors (which I liked too), but this movie sets the stage for so many more excellent films.  I just hope they follow through.  I can see it going more dark knight/Gotham soon.  Or some other direction.  Which is why I really like this film, it's got the potential to bring ""cliffhanger"" back into modern films.  Let's see what they do with it.  The Stan Lee cameos were awesome!  But man, why'd they have to do away with  E...",1437264000,,654,4.31404958677686

Hob Goblin was /meh, but I think Electro made up for that. Gwen Stacey's fate has the intended effect. Over all I enjoyed this movie very much. My son absolutely loves it. One of my favorite scenes has to be at the end when the Rhino is shooting up downtown NYC and the little boy steps out of the crow to challenge him as Spiderman.

6127375,4,B00H2FPY20,"I was of the opinion that we didn't need a Spider-Man reboot because, even though the films went downhill, I had enjoyed the first two so much.  Still, I do like the character, so I always planned to see The Amazing Spider-Man 2.  That chance didn't wind up happening until it hit Blu-Ray, but I enjoyed it.

Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is reveling in his life saving New York from one disaster after another.  In fact, as the film opens, he is stopping robbers who were stealing radioactive material on his high school graduation day.  Unfortunately, he is still haunted by the memory of his girlfriend Gwen Staceys dad warning him away from his daughter.  In fact, his desire to keep Gwen (Emma Stone) safe causes such a problem that he and Gwen break up.

Meanwhile, over as OsCorp, an employee named Max (Jamie Foxx) is a loner who becomes obsessed with Spider-Man after a run in with Peter in costume.  And Peters friend Harry (Dane DeHaan) is about to inherit the company when his father dies.  A freak accident and a quest for a cure will give Spider-Man two villains and help him learn more about his parents disappearance.  But can he defeat an electrically charged villain?

I was pretty much on board from the first scene, which featured great action and some very fun quips.  Unfortunately, the story did get bogged down in the middle, not too surprising since the film runs almost two and a half hours.  (And they cut out quite a number of scenes, too.)

Still, I did appreciate the character development made over the course of the film.  This film isn't just about action but it shows the heart of Peter and how his life as a superhero affects his regular life.  There are some great scenes with Aunt May (Sally Field) that highlight this as well as the scenes with Gwen.  While the climax didn't affect me quite as much as I thought it might while watching it, I felt it for a couple of hours afterward, so it was obviously very well done.

The acting was uniformly great.  Jamie Foxx was a definite standout in that department as he went through the greatest change, but everyone had their great moments.

The effects were wonderful as well.  I bought Spider-Mans swinging through the city and all the various fights, but the highlight again as Electro.  The computer effects on him were amazing.

Considering how they left things, Im definitely on board for the next movie in this rebooted franchise.  The Amazing Spider-Man 2 will please all the fans of this comic book hero.",1434672000,,2497,4.622727272727273
6127376,4,B00H2FPY20,"After a weak origin story that came to close to the original Spider-Man in both time and plot, this sequel had none of the punch of Spider-Man 2.

6127378,1,B00H2FPY20,Awful I was disappointed when I watched it in the movie theater. I would never see this  movie again. At least when Tobey McGuire did these movies they kept it within the spirit of the original comic book. The first Amazing Spiderman was well done. But this second movie was all over the place with very little character development. The Green Goblin was just plain boring and weird.,1434585600,6,383,4.632352941176471

6127382,4,B00H2FPY20,"Right away I'm going to say that this movie is not the best superhero movie to ever be made. It's not even the best Spider-Man movie to ever be made, but it is a solid film that's entertaining and that's all that matters, right This film is a huge improvement over the first Amazing Spider-Man which couldn't shake the feeling that we'd seen Spidey's origin before and that this was nothing more than a recap. But with ASM2 the filmmakers were finally allowed to break free creatively and create an interesting film with a new villain that Spidey gets to tussle with that the audience has never had the pleasure of seeing on the silver screen. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are the highlight of this film and their chemistry is on point which makes the character of Peter Parker more vulnerable to the audience as in the comics where he relies heavily on the support of the women in his life. While I do feel that there were some things crammed into this movie for the sake of setting up Sony's now postponed Sinister Six movie-namely the inclusion of Rhino and the Green Goblin-this movie was an overall good time.
Side note: Even though Marvel and Sony are rebooting (AGAIN) the Spider-Man characyer together, this movie should not be skipped over. I'm sure what Marvel and Sony will produce will be fantastic (especially since Spidey now has access to other giant superheroes) but ASM2 is still a movie that will please and entertain even the slightest of Spidey fans out there.",1433980800,,1482,4.6603053435114505

That being said escalating budgets cause talented filmmakers to have less and less control. Directors and screenwriters are trading creativity for color by numbers paychecks. I don't blame them. I would sign up tomorrow for that. But when the studio is the pilot the course you set is predictable, uninspiring and SAFE. Quality is not even a consideration. All that matters is ""how can we sell this."" I imagine the first meeting for Amazing Spider-Man 2 as a bunch of executives sitting around trying to decide how to ""sell"" another Spider-Man movie, and they all threw in a bunch of ideas, hired a few writers to make the ideas stick, then told a talented director to make a movie out of this mess.",1433462400,2,914,4.71875

6127414,4,B00H2FPY20,I haven't read the criticism and I for one don't  see how it's warranted. Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spiderman and he and Emma Stone had great chemistry. Whether it was the writers or Andrew himself in this incarnation there was a level of emotion and humor that was missing although attempted in the previous version. The only possible drawback were the visual effects which were simultaneously stunning but also maybe overdone and distracting. It started to look like a video game.  But all in all it was worth the spontaneous purchase and I'll probably watch it a few more times. Definitely made me a fan of Andrew Garfield.

6127433,5,B00H2FPY20,"It seems there are reviews all over the board that are either praising this movie or, more often, disliking it for pulling a ""spiderman 3"" with throwing too many things at the viewers at once.  As you can see by my 5 star review, I love it, but let me explain why.  I'm a fan of the comics, but I understand that when you go from comic book to movie, the director is allowed some creative license.  Yes, there were many characters/villains in this movie, but 2 of the 3 take a backseat for most of it.  They serve the purpose of setting up the universe in a way that actually flows quite nicely.  The characters are all fleshed out (except for Rhino, who I'm not sure if I really want to know intimately...) There is plenty of action, yes, but there is also plenty of moments that will make you laugh, cry, and just take a breath.  All of the interactions between Peter and Gwen and Peter and his Aunt May are fantastically played out and seem natural, as if the actors weren't even reading from a script but just going with the flow of the scene.  The movie does a great job of explaining just enough to give you more questions, but not overload you.  I like that it's long, so they can get all of the content into the movie without making it seem rushed.  Too many movies these days cut out all of the ""breath"" scenes to make you feel like it's on fast-forward.
Lastly, I'll just say that Andrew Garfield does an amazing job as spider-man and the chemistry between him and Emma Stone is phenomenal.  I love where they are taking this series and I can't wait to see the next one. :)",1430006400,,1583,4.264214046822742

6127447,3,B00H2FPY20,"I've been a lifelong fan ofSpider-Man, but have mixed feelings about this movie.  The first time I watched it, I did not like it.  Recently, I watched the first one, which I did enjoy, so I gave this one another chance, and although I didn't hate it, there were things about it I wasn't a fan of.  To be positive, Andrew Garfield IMO is the best Spider-Man we've had so far, he really pulls off Peter Parker's awkwardness and Spider-Man's wiseass attitude. Secondly, I love the costume, it looks exactly like the comics.  As far as what I didn't like was how they completely wasted the character of Norman Osborn, who was one of the most important characters in the Spider-Man sage to a mere cameo/background character, and also that the Rhino is thrown in there for really no reason complicates things. Overall, if you can detach yourself from what you already know about Spider-Man and just watch this as a film, it's not that bad, but if you do know the character, I think you will agree with me that there was a lot of wasted potential here.

6127459,4,B00H2FPY20,"I really enjoyed the reboot in Amazing Spider-Man.  The superhero felt better to me in that he was more of a wisecrack when busting crime.  This movie falls in the same pitfalls that the other spider-man movies fell into with multiple villains and the love interest taking center stage once again.  It's understandable as this has been a dilemma for Peter Parker from the getgo, but we should see some rather more interesting fight scenes or more things that take up a better use of the spider-man license. Instead we get a decent movie(which I still thing Garfield does great as Peter/Spidey), but it just doesn't do the characters(or the villains for that matter) justice at all.  It also seemed to much of a set-up for a Spin-off as well and just felt unfocused.  All in all it's still an enjoyable time, it just could have been so much more.",1428278400,,845,4.6066666666666665

The first Amazing Spider-Man left a lot to be desired and this one looked like a step down based on the previews. Unfortunately, the movie was even worse than I thought it would be. I cannot say anything positive about the film at all. The acting was horrendous. The writing was some of the worst I've ever seen. There were many things that were never explained, every character was way over the top, and the character development was amateur at best. The graphics were the worst I've seen in any movie this century, including the first Spider-Man trilogy. Terminator 2 (which came out almost 25 years ago) had better CGI. Even the music selection was awful. Every time I heard the music, it did not correspond with the action on the screen. And the endless Sony product placement in the movies was too much for me. The 2.5 hour movie seemed to go on for much longer than that. I could keep going on and on, but if I haven't convinced you to save two hours of your life by now, nothing else I say will do so.",1427068800,5,1114,4.3349282296650715

6127492,4,B00H2FPY20,"I love Spider-Man, comics, cartoons and especially when he makes it to the big screen. I loved the first trilogy with Sam rammi and Toby McGuire. But it seem liked it was missing something and some of it was so campy and sine of the outfits reminded of a power rangers episode. And they totally dropped the ball on the third one. So they reboot it and I love the first amazing Spider-Man the story was good the action was good and it had more of a over all Spider-Man feel that the first set of movies were missing. So the sequel comes along. While it does have its faults and problems. To many bad guys and drama. It's still got some cool action and epic bad guys we haven't seen in a Spider-Man movie before. Like electro and rhino. I do think that Jamie Fox could had done a better job playing electro but maybe he worked with what he had.

Spolier alert******
If you haven't seen the film and want to stop reading this now. And this film had the bls to do something no other Spider-Man film could do they killed off Stacy Gwen which I was really surprised in touched. That brings a grit and darker tone than other Spider-Man movies explored. But there is its faults to many sub plots that go nowhere and there's a little bit of campyness that we really didn't need. And the sub plot of his dead parents sort of ridiculous. But I think they were trying something new and trying to keep it interesting. But in recent news no more Spider-Man sequels and this franchise is dead. Their going to recast another Spider-Man and reboot him again and he will first apear in captain America civil war along side cap himself and iron man and black panther which in itself is awesome! I was really disappointed when they cancelled a superman returns sequel because I really wanting to see what Bryan singer would do with the next superman movie. But then we got man of steel which I think is a far better superman movie and Henry cavil is a better superman than Brandon routh.

6127550,4,B00H2FPY20,"The beginning was rather boring.  They spent way too much time showing scenes from the previous movie.  They treat the viewer as if this is the first Spiderman movie their watching.  It's a sequel.  If the viewer is watching them out of order, that's the viewer's problem.  The film maker's shouldn't make it everyone's problem.  Other than that, the movie wasn't too bad, although the copy we bought only made it about half way through before the picture started freezing.  Hopefully we can return it for a better copy.  Despite that, it was a typical Spiderman movie.  Plenty of action.  It did leave you kind of hanging at the end.  I'm sure that's to set it up for the 3rd one that's already being worked on.  I don't remember when that one's scheduled to be released, but all these spiderman movies are taking the shape of the Star Trek movies.  Too many sequels, then start a new set of them with more sequels, then start a new set with even more sequels.  Yada, yada, yada.  It was fun to watch though.",1424908800,,1009,4.497237569060774

The other complaint, the ending.  The Rhino fight sequence just felt tacked on - the setup went on way too long to be just a teaser for the next movie.  Other than those two gripes, I enjoyed it.  Spidey's sense of humor really shines in this one.",1424736000,,538,4.33

6127557,2,B00H2FPY20,"Peter Parker still has the same old problems. Money is tight, his girlfriend Gwen Stacy is in danger if he dates her so he doesn't want to date her (plus he promised her dad he wouldn't), his pal Harry Osborn is dying of some weird family disease, and Spider-Man isn't popular with the press or the cops. On the plus side, he is popular with the run-of-the-mill New Yorkers, Harry thinks Spider-Man's blood can cure him, and Peter can't resist dating Gwen.

Spider-Man saves run-of-the-miller Max Dillon, an electrical engineer at Oscorp (Harry's family company), who becomes an obsessed fan and later on the electricity-wielding villain Electro, so that doesn't work out for Peter. Spider-Man refuses to share his blood with Harry, who tries another path and later on becomes the pumpkin-bomb-weilding villain Green Goblin, so that doesn't work out either. Anybody want to take a bet on how things will work out with Gwen?

The storyline with Gwen is the most interesting, well-written, and well-acted of the plot threads. The other stories have interesting elements but aren't well-developed enough to be satisfying. Harry Osborn's story could easily have been its own film. The Green Goblin shows up at the end to make the story turn out a certain way though that could have been easily accomplished just with Electro. Then another villain, Rhino, shows up for the last minute of the film, again only to make the story move one final step forward. The various stories don't hold together well, leaving me disappointed in the film as a whole.",1424649600,,1544,4.934615384615385

I really enjoyed the first amazing Spider-Man movie and was flipping through the channels on tv when I saw this and had to watch it. I loved both so much, I decided I had to order them both. The actors are very, very good. In fact, after watching these Spider-Man movies, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone may be my favorite actors. They really make you believe their characters and issues are real.
I've heard many say they feel this movie is cluttered with too many ideas, and I understand. There is a lot going on especially with three evil villains lurking about. However, I felt like it gave me a lot to watch right now and also gave me a lot to look forward to in the future. The special features are more of the same that you saw on the first film. There's another lengthy ""making of"" extra that gives viewers an in depth look at everything.
Overall, I enjoyed it and anyone who liked the first movie should watch this one. I'm just really upset at the announcement that they're recasting Andrew Garfield and rebooting the series again!

6127594,3,B00H2FPY20,"Amazing Spidey 2 has already been reviewed so I have little to add about the content. I'm only addressing the quality of the home 3D blu-ray. SONY did an impeccable color transfer from the film to disc. The images and effects are pristine and crisp. There are exciting camera angles and the feeling of seeing NYC thru Spidey's eyes are conveyed well. Having said that, I feel this transfer lacks the immersive qualities of exceptional blu-rays like Tron Legacy, Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy.  Why? The 3D blu-ray is not produced with a shifting 2.40:1 / 1.78:1 aspect ratio. It is letterboxed throughout.

The constant view of the black horizontal bars to keep the theatrical screen image didn't enhance the viewing experience. It distracts from both the depth and dimensionality of the art direction. In fact, after thirty minutes, I had to switch to 2D blu-ray due to eye strain.

I am an avid yet selective collector of 3D blu-ray. Not all special effects films make for a great 3D blu-ray viewing and this is one such film. Buy the standard copy and you will enjoy it as much.",1423353600,2,1086,4.705263157894737

6127597,2,B00H2FPY20,"In terms of gratuitous CGI this has a lot.  But I only sorta liked the Amazing Spider-man and I care for this one even less.  I found the first three films much better, and I could never understand the apparent need to once again show (and for some reason re-write) his beginnings.

I have always been a fan of the Marvel Universe and Spider-man was my favorite due to the realism, which was a unique idea for a comic book hero at the time.  I was a proud owner of Spider-Man 1 until I sold it in the late 70's.

This films throws too many villains into the story while re-writing their origins as already established in the comics and first three films.  One starts to get the feeling that almost anyone can get super powers through some clumsy mishap.  Some of the dialog makes me remember the Batman and Robin movie and how that killed the franchise until the new films came out.  I think that with this film Spidy might have jumped the shark.",1423267200,,946,4.3352272727272725

6127601,2,B00H2FPY20,"Two versions:

Andrew Garfield is the second actor to don muscle enhancing spandex in the current Spiderman franchise and his tenure is rumoured to be capped at two outings. Half way through this 140 minute marathon Peter Parker has spent most of his time stalking Gwen. Finally they attain lip lock in an Oscorp service closet. To my way of thinking there is nothing wrong with either actor who has played Spidey a good script wouldnt have fixed. Sally Field as the Weepy Widow is rather insufferable. That this superhero goes home to mummy/aunty to get his dirty underwear washed is rather laughable and sad.

This flick takes ages to get anywhere and the audience may die of boredom waiting for it to do it. Definitely not for the vertigo challenged. There is cartoonish violence and people do die here. One may believe the gangly Garfield as a spider but spider venom gives that little twerp unbelievable strength. One is given too much time to ponder these conundrums.

Some movies seem way too long. Had I paid $15 to watch The Amazing Spiderman Two live Id have probably toughed it out, otherwise Id have walked out after 15 minutes. Takes way to long for anything to happen in this 140-minute marathon. Radio-active blood or not this gangling spider has only 4 limbs and only enough brains to control one of them. Someone should stomp on him and put him out of his misery. Too much angst and not enough action here. Spidey spends nearly an hour stalking Gwen as only a spider could from vertigo-inducing heights. The movie cant decide if its an unrequited love story, a tragedy, or an action movie. The final action sequence is truncated lest the audience die of boredom.",1423180800,,1679,4.704081632653061

Though I am a huge spidey fan and can add that I love the reboot. I know a lot of people hate it, but I think it's pretty good. I am just glad that spidey isn't dead in Hollywood! He was always my favorite super hero, and I'll take some more spidey movies/cartoon series any day. If you are a big fan yourself, be sure and buy the spectacular spider-man animated series on blu ray!!! I recently watched it and would recommend it highly. It's te best animated spidey to date. Way better than the new ultimate junk. That's all I'll say about the movie, it's been out long enough now that you're probably buying this for the same reason I did.
On to the review of the ELECTRO head.
sculpt- sculpt is pretty cool with a likeness to Jamie foxx. I didn't buy it for that, just bought it for the villain himself. Electro is pretty cool an I think the new look of him in this movie is a good one. The old yellow lighting bolt mask look was weird.
Electro is made I some sort of plastic and is hollow throughout. He simply screws off/on to the shoulder/neck base with an easy half turn. The sculpt like I said is cool but to me the real magic only happens when he's switched on. I you saw any video footage of it, you may worry that it doesn't light up good. I can tell you it lights up great! The magic comes from under the hollowed head. They have color changing LEDs on the base that simply shine up inside the head. It sounds simple because it is. The cool thing about it is when the lights come on, the dark color blue turns to bright electric blue and continues to change a lil here and there making a flicker recreating the electricity running through electro in the movie. It does a great job to be such a simple design.
I love it and it's proudly displayed on my entertainment center.
The price is steep on this however because it's a collector item. I leave it up to you to pay the price. I say if you want it for the look of it, go for it, because it does not disappoint. Who cares about price. Nobody has to know and if you like it, go for it. Is it worth the asking price? Again I leave that up to the collector in you. The materials it took to make the head plus the awesome movie should make you happy with your purchase. I was lucky enough to get it for around 69.00 just before the price went up. I honestly feel like that what you are paying for is the chance to own a cool looking electro display to how your friends. I live mine, and price isn't a factor here. Heck, I just paid 75.00 for an old doc ock action figure at Christmas. I get what I want (responsibly) and forget about value :)",1423008000,,2670,4.116858237547893

Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are the absolute stars of this movie, with other great performances from Jamie Foxx ( Electro ) and Dane DeHaan ( Green Goblin ). I really liked the continued story and how they connected each characters plot with each other. I was pretty mad the actual green goblin was in the movie for like 5 minutes, but this is just an introductory and knowing he will return in the franchise helps me get over it. I can see why fans were upset the rhyno was barely in the movie but then again it's INTRODUCTORY, we'll see him later down the road. Overall I think if you are a Spidey fan you'll like It and if your just a movie fan you may think meh. As for me I can't wait for the next one!",1422316800,,966,4.06282722513089

6127625,3,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a complicated movie, not because of its plot but because of my ultimate reaction. It is, of course, the sequel to the original movie which was a reboot of Sam Raimi Spiderman movie series, but I can't help but compare The Amazing Spiderman 2 with the original Spiderman 3. Despite what everyone thinks, I think this is the movie that had all the problems that they accused Spiderman 3 of having.

So if you remember the ending to the first Amazing Spiderman movie, The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues where the first film left off and the love story is really first thing that gets developed. Since Gwen Stacy's father, the police chief, was killed off in the first movie Peter Parker has been feeling guilty that he could be putting his girlfriend in danger while he's dating her and fighting crime as Spiderman at the same time. However, if I thought the love story was lackluster in the original movie, it is downright bad in the sequel.

Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spiderman is really the young adolescent who's overconfident and cocky, which is actually not a bad interpretation of the comic book character. However, Andrew Garfield really sucks when he tries to confess to Gwen Stacy with teary eyes that he can't see her again because of his guilty conscience. The plot also seems unfocused because before we're even introduced to a villain he comes back and reestablishes their romance for no reason other than to get that subplot over with. Peter Parker also comes across as creepy, when he confesses to Gwen Stacy that he's using his spider powers to follow and stalk her every day, like he's a vampire from the Twilight series. Ugh!

My taste for this movie is already bad before the real plot line has even started, but the introduction of the villain, Electro, is alright. He starts off as an electrical engineer named Max Dillon who had his life saved by Spiderman once and then became a downright creepy fanboy of him. Anyways, it's after an electrical accident that Max discovers he has electrical powers. Naturally, since he was an unstable man to begin with he becomes jealous of Spiderman's fame and decides he'll hurt people for the attention he wants. Now in all fairness, I like Electro's design and his cool sounding voice and the threatening music that happens whenever he's around. It is, however, when he first starts discovering the extent of his powers that Spiderman ends the first battle scene between them in a very anti-climatic fashion. Electro then gets locked up so he can disappear from the plot line until he can come back again in the movie's climax.

However, I really must confess that I think the real plot line of this movie is the relationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn. I would have felt better if this plot was first developed in the original movie, but the sequel does a pretty good job introducing Harry to the story and establishing the friendship he had with Peter. Harry's conflict in this movie, as the owner of the business Oscorp, revolves around a congenital disease his father has been trying to help him overcome before he died. So Harry is really more sympathetic in this version than the original Spiderman movie, and his desperation for Spiderman's healing powers drives him over the edge. But I believe the plot gets unnecessarily complicated when the chairmen of Harry's company decide to betray him and the measures he takes become even more extreme... all of these before he even becomes Green Goblin.

The reason I ultimately compare The Amazing Spiderman 2 with Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3, is because Spiderman 3 was accused of having too many villains when it was released in theaters. When I watched it, I really didn't have a problem with that because all the villains played against the struggle Spiderman was going through and all of them flawlessly shared a climatic battle that had a satisfying conclusion.

Despite it's best intentions The Amazing Spiderman 2 is overwhelmed with too many plots that are not combined as cleverly as the writers think. To conclude the development of both villains this movie actually has two climatic battles, one after the other, like this is actually two movies that accidentally had their scripts mixed up. Not to mention, the ending of this movie is stupid because it's a tragedy. The Amazing Spiderman 2 has a sad ending that it wasn't really building up too, but just so it could appease the audience the ending drags on a few scenes too long. Spiderman goes through another unexpected struggle that should be its own movie, but since the creative team would rather have a happy ending they resolve the tragic ending much too quickly and trade it for a happy one.

The flaw of The Amazing Spiderman 2 is having a very unorganized plot that takes Spiderman's struggle in a very unclear direction. I'm never entirely sure if he feels guilty that Electro used to be one of his fans or if Gwen Stacy's involvement with him is any worse than the usual risks. Our emotional investment is more in the action scenes than the tragic backstories of all these characters. The only thing I believe is clear is that Peter Parker really drove Harry Osborn to an extreme when he couldn't bring himself to help cure his congenital disease, even if it was with good reason, but that makes Harry Osborn my favorite part of this movie. Not exactly Green Goblin, who shows up only in the end, but Harry Osborn at least had a clear direction his characters was developing towards.

And Rhino... that villain's involvement in the plot is hardly worth bringing up at all. My only complaint is when a kid dressed in a spiderman costume tries to stand up to him in the streets. I mean... it's a noble gesture, but I believe parents teach their kids that superhero costumes will not make them fly off the garage roof for a reason!

The Amazing Spiderman 2 has amazing production standards and tons of amazing special effects. That part of the movie I at least enjoyed and I at least had the feeling that I was still watching a Spiderman movie. I am convinced, however, that this plot line has no silver line hidden behind it's complexity and its intentions.

I know we live in a CGI world now but they didn't even try to make Spiderman look realistic or blend him in with the surroundings/matte. He looks so fake against the backdrop of NYC that it is almost impossible to suspend your disbelief.  The dialogue is pretty bad but what's worse are the snarky comments he makes.

6127670,4,B00H2FPY20,"I was not expecting to like this film so much.

While the Spiderman movies have always been watchable and even sometimes involving, I'd felt that they had lately gotten a little too angst-y for my tastes, too involved in expressing teenage issues and romance over the more enjoyable action angles. Let's face it: I wasn't paying $25 per ticket (and food) in order to see how Parker's love life was doing.

But I found this movie to be almost immediately entertaining and the action scenes were snappy and drove the story quite well. There were little glitches at times, but overall I found this to be a rich and exciting movie.

Like I said, I wasn't so sure at the start. I immediately cringed when I determined what passed for dialogue here...the movie aimed for what I call the ""Shia LaBeouf"" style of patter that dearly wants to feel it's being honest and realistic, bur really all it does is have the characters talk over each other's lines and mutter endlessly...it devalues dialogue to the point of my not caring at all. Here, though, Jamie Foxx's early depiction of Max Dillon was so purposely shy that he became a doormat for almost everyone, and his inability to articulate or project his dialogue displayed that very point.

But what made this film so enjoyable for me was its terrific visual style; this movie, more than any of its predecessors , revels in its titular characters' unique method of locomotion, and it is a remarkable thing to watch in this movie. This time around director Marc Webb (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Spider-Man/dp/B009B0JSD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-Of-Summer/dp/B0031Q0XCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(500) Days Of Summer</a>) used cinematographer Daniel Mindel (the two latest Star Trek movies) and the change is for the better...this film is A LOT more visually stunning than the last. Replete with crystalline, lucid photography and powerful moments of ""trapped"" motion, the scenes of Spidey looping his way through Manhattan have such crackling visual power and kinetic energy that it's almost impossible to do anything else but be dazzled by it. I really felt like I was swooping along with Spiderman, and it consistently makes for a gloriously fun ride.

In addition, there are other clever, unusual pluses in the film: for one thing, there is a playfulness within that strikes at unusual times. For example, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) wants so badly to talk to Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) that he often makes ridiculous mistakes: for instance, there's one throwaway moment when he is so eager to speak to Gwen that he uses his web to swoop down to speak to her still wearing his civvies. At another point he comes in close quarters with a cop blaring away on a megaphone, and after the man in blue speaks right into Spiderman's face our hero in turn shouts out his own next few lines, temporarily deaf.

And while I'm really not a fan of Jamie Foxx, I thought he did all right here. For me, Jamie Foxx movies often suffer because the actor tries too hard to eat up the scenes - like, say, Vin Diesel or Tom Cruise. He often has that ""Golly, aren't I terrific?"" quality -- but here I thought his role was very submerged. In fact, as I mentioned earlier his character was so mousy he almost disappeared.

A little sidebar, here, in fact: I've often felt our villains tell a lot about the concerns of society:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rodan/dp/B0044WUJMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rodan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B000VXWK86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;speak to a nation frightened by nuclear power, for instance, or global terrorism within the DIE HARD franchise, or increased depersonalization in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B0094K35S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>. Here, Foxx's Dillon becomes Electro after a dispute with his bosses at work. In essence, one could argue he is bears a strong resemblance to those ripped from our own headlines. Certainly, we don't feel sympathy for those in our own society who fight with their managers, then go home, gather their weapons, and return to their workplace in order to shoot it out with anyone who stands in their way. Yet our comic book sympathy increases ESPECIALLY if that very same person has that same initial confrontation -- and then falls into a very conveniently placed vat of electric eels.  Particularly because, in the latter case, you've got yourself a Super Villain.

The movie makes some odd choices...I think if we haven't overworked the Nazi mad doctor (even in comic strips) we've come awfully close, and Dr. Alex Kafka (?) and his over-sized black rubber gloves, though true to the comic, may be that one time too many.

But I think the award for The Most Misused Hollywood Star may be won here, as Paul Giamatti is all but invisible in this film. Granted, they're setting him us up for the NEXT film, but when will that come along? 2018? Here, I doubt most people even knew he was in the movie.

But here's a personal Cry Out to ALL MOVIES EVERYWHERE: could we stop, for all time, the trope that has our hero stop the bad guy, then turn our back on him before they are sure the criminal is down and completely out? It happens at the start of this movie, during a fight aboard a private jet in which our hero's parents are duking it out with a Bad Man who has sabotaged their plane. They overcome him, but then OF COURSE, our hero turns his back on the bad guy, who OF COURSE, comes back to life.. When, oh when, will Hollywood stop using this gimmick?",1420848000,10,5853,5.2827956989247316

I'm not kidding, if you think this is a good representation of Spiderman you don't know who Spiderman is.

Complete misrepresentation of the character. I actually thought Garfield played Spidey fairly well in the first movie and it seemed like a step in the right direction. I know a lot of people love the Sam Raimi movies but they really don't hold up well. I thought Toby was terrible and I just never got invested in the characters and whatnot.

Aside from that they did have some good stuff and at first I thought these reboots were not necessary, but the more I thought about it the more I welcomed a new series for Spiderman. This new series is not worthy though, it's not good enough. This movie in particular is perhaps one of the worst superhero movies ever made. Everything from the plot to the acting, everything, all horrendously bad.

And don't tell me that the trailers were not complete lies to feed people into making them really want to see the movie.

And I really thought it was going to be some comical stupid movie with Jaimie Foxx saying stupid things like the Wayans do, I really thought he was going to ruin it and he didn't, he made me love it. It's a serious movie with great effects and much better villains than the Tobey movies.

6127700,5,B00H2FPY20,"I loved this Spiderman reboot with Andrew Garfield. Andrew brings an air of nerdy sex appeal to his role as high school student whose curiosity lands him in the research lab of his dead father's partner. Great place to be bitten by a spider if he's not careful, and Andrew does not fail to be careless resulting in being rained on by research spiders falling on his head, and one down the neck of his shirt in order to execute the bite that transforms him into Spiderman.  Thereafter follow flying lessons and a few rough landings until Andrew gets the hang of shooting webs from his wrists.  And the rest is comic book history, but this Spiderman keeps his sexy edge only hinted at before the spider bite, as he goes about rescuing the hapless citizens of his city, or romancing his formerly secret crush, who turns out to be the daughter of the Chief of Police who thinks Spiderman in a criminal.  But when did the path of true love ever run smoothly?  In any event, catch this version of the comic book classic and decide for yourself if Andrew Garfield is not one hot, flying dream.",1420502400,,1086,4.46969696969697
6127701,2,B00H2FPY20,"Dear lord this was just one painful minute after another.  The only truly redeeming part of this haphazard sequel was the casting of Jamie Foxx as Electro.  His performance is stellar amidst (and in spite of) the drudging script and an ensemble of cringe-worthy performances from the rest of the cast.  But that's really all it has going for it.  The graphics aren't much better or any more believable than the first ""Amazing Spiderman"" of which this is based.  I appreciated the overall plot line somewhat, but not enough to suggest that anyone else subject themselves to the 2+ hours of torture.  This movie, in fact, isn't even good enough to have playing in the background while you are working on something else and aren't even paying attention to it.  I actually would like to keep writing about how bad this movie really is, but I keep getting more and more worked up as I go along, and I'm afraid I might blow a fuse in my brain if I get bent out of shape any further.

6127705,3,B00H2FPY20,"The natural chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone was the primary reason this interpretation of Spider-Man worked. This film chose, instead, to boost the CGI instead of the story, jamming too many villains into the fairly straight-forward story. Furthermore, the film goes out of its way to break-up then make-up the star pair before the ultimate ending, making it feel cheap and random. The outstanding questions from the first film are answered, so that's a plus. The action is thrilling, and the web-slinging ride is just as energetic as the first film. While this film falters on its potential, it is still a fun time.",1420416000,2,633,4.981132075471698

From  a ""Technical""  stand  point  the  film  is  amazing,  the  visuals  are  beautiful,  the  action  sequences  a  shot  with  incredible  skill,  in my personal opinion  the  action  sequences  in  this  spider-man film  blow  the  Raimi  films  out  of  the  water!  They  are  so  immersive  and  thrilling.  The  chemistry  between  Emma Stone  and  Andrew Garfield  is  just  so  adorable.  Some  of  the  problems  that  were  addressed by  other  people  are  understandable  but  honestly  the  to many  villains  thing  isn't  really  a  problem  because  rhino  isn't  in  the  film  long  enough  for  me  to  have  a  problem  with  him.  The  whole  of  the  film  was  always  about  the  fact  that  harry  osborn  has  come  back  and  the  relationship  between  him  and  peter,  but  where  i  think  sony  really  dropped  the  ball  was  removing  a lot  of  Dane  Dehaan's  scenes  those  scenes  were  freaking  incredible!  especially  the  deleted  scene ""Peter's Father""  that  was  so  emotional  and  they  took  it  out  why?!  On  top  of  that  where  in  the  hell  are  Shailene Woodley's  scenes?  why  aren't  they  in  the  deleted  scenes  ?  PLEASE  FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  GOD  RESTORE  THOSE  SCENES  TO  THE  FILM!  But  on  its  own  ""Amazing Spider-Man 2""  is  a  fun  action  film  if  you  are  worried  about  purchasing  it, it  is  currently  playing  on  ""Starz""  or  rent  it  honestly  i  enjoyed  it  for  what  it  was.",1420243200,,1700,4.511363636363637

6127760,4,B00H2FPY20,"After trashing the first of the Spider-Man reboot, I planned on dumping this franchise altogether. After seeing numerous trailers and the additions to the cast, I was convinced to give it a shot.

This sequel is much better than the first film, it seemed more together and it was very entertaining. I also loved that Peter Parker spent more time in the Spider-Man suit stopping evil. While it was very cool to see actors like Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamanti in comic character roles, it was Dane DeHann that stole the show for me as Harry Osbourne. He nailed the role with all the emotions and his on screen chemistry with Andrew Garfield and Emma stone was wonderful. Yes, there was plenty for fans to riled up about especially what happened to Norman Osbourne. The film ends once again on a cliff hanger, but it leaves you with a shocker after the final fight scene. After seeing this film I will not deny that I was so excited to see the films to follow. Sony announced that these films would carry on for a few more years and now it looks like they are getting scrapped due to Marvel acquiring the rights once again. Andrew Garfield looks like he is being kicked out and the web slinger will be re-invented again.

I have to say that I am little upset about that because I thought Andrew Garfield was a very good Spider-Man. Now I am kind of glad I never purchased these films on DVD because we have to pretend these don't exist anymore. I will always acknowledge the Sam Raimi films, and thanks to a very strong sequel I will be proud to say that I at least gave this reboot a try. I just hope the third and hopefully final reboot will be good.",1419379200,9,1646,4.375816993464053

Loses one more star for being well-written and quite likeable, until it was nearly over and the whole thing takes a sudden dive. NOT a happy ending, you'd expect. It BARELY gets 2 stars.

I'm glad we only spent $1.50 at our library for a two day rental instead of full price here.

My opinion regarding the use of CGI in film has not changed in 30 years - it's not gonna change today.  If practical effects are harder to do, too dangerous to do, too expensive to do - more than they are worth... write around the scene or do the WHOLE thing as a book - simple. If for no other reason, all the wonderful, talented, FX people, model makers and set designers the industry was once known for, may never work again...that's just not right. MUCH of what was computer generated in Amazing Spider-Man 2 could have been hand drawn and painted , frame by frame.",1418774400,,1043,4.439790575916231

The only good thing in this followup is that they have setup the 3rd installment perfectly. For Sony's sake, I hope they get some better writers though.

His lines were running amok, not too mention the outfit looked like a cheap Halloween costume one can buy at WalMart!  The outfit Toby wore in the previous other 3 Spiderman movies was pretty cool. The costume department took a great effort to create a nice one that was rich with textures and details and low tone red and blue colors. A realistic costume and even appeared thicker.

Andrew Garfield is awful as Spiderman and as Peter Parker. He seemed to act more like Shia LeBeauf than Peter Parker. The clichs were over the top in this movie. It is corny, stupid and predictable.
The cgi is over the top.
The villains were horribly adapted. This movie reeked of Batman and Robin since it looked like a toy ad when there was action. Oh, let's talk about that. This movie was very twilight-ish. Too much teen angst and not enough superhero action. The film dragged in almost every scene.
The Rhino at the end of the movie looked like a toy. His dialogue was the most laughable in the movie. The dialogue was bad until this scene. I need to make a recommendation, do no watch this ridiculous movie with coffee or soda since you choke on it laughing and ruin a nice rug.
In sum, overdone cgi, stupid plot and awful dialogue makes this an amazing stinker.

6127877,4,B00H2FPY20,"I've heard the staggering complaints about this film, but I watched it anyway. After seeing Spider Man 3 more than five years ago, I figured nothing could be that disappointing. I'm glad I did, this was a decent hero flick, with some fun moments and new on-screen characters.

Is it perfect? Is it as good as the previous film? No, it's not. But the previous film was a big high point for me, and for a lot of viewers. Nobody expected much from Andrew Garfield, but he delivered perfectly as Peter Parker. People were skeptical about The Lizard on a big screen, but they made it work, and it worked well! The last film was honestly a big one to try and beat.

This film suffers from screenwriting. The actors all deliver exactly how they should, and while some of Electro's dialogue in particular leaves much to be desired, it's no fault of Jamie Foxx. It's just subparagraph dialogue in parts.

The biggest issue I see, is that they were so determined to set up the NEXT films, and the events for those, that they didn't spend any time tightening up and fine tuning the events and character development for THIS film. Electro had a lot of potential here, more than I would have thought based on his comic character. I was impressed (at times) by how well fleshed out he was. But then there were other times, where it felt like someone wrote ""Electro is angry"" and nobody bothered to write that any better or elaborate well. They just rushed that, and it really hurts the movie.

They wanted to introduce the Sinister Six, and that's a good move for the studio... On paper.

But when you spend most of your time alluding to what's coming in the future, you miss a lot of the point where you need to entertain your audience with what they're seeing now. The green goblin character, for example, seems to jump from non-existent all the way to full blown final nemesis battle in the span of five minutes. It was too much, too fast, with no build up.

These are some big complaints, but they're specifically script, and a little director related. But the talent on screen clearly makes the best that anyone could with it, and they save this from being another tragedy of a film. It's not a Grade A superhero flick, but it's not an instant bargain bin filler either. If you really like Spider Man, I would recommend this. If you're on the fence, at least give it a rent. You won't need to tell all your friends about how Amazing it was (I know, I'm sorry, it was there), but you won't remember it with the same disdain as some of the prior films. A decent successor, with some shortcomings is still a decent successor.",1416700800,8,2613,4.467505241090147

The characters are altered (the girlfriend is not the one in the comics) and it seems that many people know the hero's secret identity. Anybody knows that superheroes are loners because their enemies will target the loved ones to get to them, and so it does here. I detest when Hollywood rewrites the legend to suit their own goals.

I don't want to give anything away but I do feel there is too much concentration on the love relationship too much. And being a huge comic book fan I was very disappointed with Rhino. That's all I'll say about that. But I thought the movie is good and Sinister Six should be awesome. I love watching movies of my favorite character from my childhood. I still prefer Dunst and Mcguire to these new actors. But I will admit that Webb is pretty good as spiderman. Also great special effects too.,1416096000,,617,4.327586206896552

6127920,5,B00H2FPY20,"My initial reaction to ASM2 after viewing it in the theater was ..... ambivalence.  Spider-man has been my favorite comic book character since childhood (I'm in the 50 range now), so ambivalence wasn't the reaction I wanted upon leaving the theater.

Despite this, I purchased the DVD/BR disc anyway...hoping that my initial reaction was due to my kids' theater distractions, bathroom breaks, spilling drinks, no subtitles (I'm somewhat addicted to subtitles now), and the inability to pause/rewind for bathroom breaks & dialogue repeating (another comfort of home theater).

Now having watched ASM2 uninterrupted, on my 51"" plasma widescreen, w/subtitles, surround sound, and remote in hand for pausing/rewinding, I am pleased to state that ASM2 is a very good movie on its own merits, and a worthy sequel to ASM1.

The visual spectacle of the Electro/Spider-man battles is on a scale well above that of Lizard/Spiderman battles, and easily equal to the Doc-Oc/Spider-Man battles of SM2.  Its just a lot of fun to watch, and also to see how, as the movie progresses, Peter Parker (with Gwen Stacey's help) uses his intellect & science background to figure out how to combat a villain with Electro's powers, which is what he frequently did in the comics.

The Peter/Gwen relationship scenes are fine...a little slow for my kids' liking (they just want the action), which to me is a sign that the writers took it more seriously, as with ASM1 ...it's not dumbed down for kids....it's very ""adult"".  To me that is a good thing.  Her ending is well handled & pretty much follows the comic book ending (spoilers: that he tried to save her but could not).  Also, the scenes with Peter repeatedly ""seeing"" images of Gwen's father, Captain Stacey, and being haunted by it, and Peter's promise from ASM1 to ""keep Gwen out of it"", tie in nicely to ASM1.

Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne is great.  He gives the movie its dark elements, and punky attitude, as his character should.  He is a great contrast to Peter Parker/Spiderman, by the film's end.  I think both visually & in the character's writing, this is a darker version of the Green Goblin than Wilem Dafoe's, both in and out of costume.  Dafoe's Goblin was made dark by the serum, whereas DeHaan's Goblin was made dark by his desperate circumstances (spoilers: he was slowly dying from the genetic disease which killed his father Norman).

Max Dillon was almost like a Frankenstein monster character.....hated, misunderstood, not given a chance, feared.  He was brilliant yet childlike at the same time.  The Goblin/Electro ""team'up"", if you will, is much more natural than the forced Sandman/Venom teamup of SM3.  In fact, Electro literally gives life to the Goblin, while the Goblin gives freedom & direction to Electro in exchange.  It's that desperation and anger/rage in the two villains's lives which makes it believable that they work together against a common enemy, Spider-man.

Some have criticized Max Dillon's child-like mindset, but I get this now, as someone has to be in charge, that being the Goblin, which apparently is going to lead us to the Sinister Six, based upon the film's ending scenes.

Same with Rhino I guess.....not the brightest bulb.  His scene at the end reminded me of The Underminer villain scene from The Incredibles, a bit on the bombastic side, which is where some of the ASM2 humor comes in...the interaction with the Alexi/Rhino character, both at the beginning and end of the film.  Although somewhat humorous in portrayal, Rhino was in fact firing bullets & rockets, so there was no doubt he was a killer.

There was more humor in ASM2 than in the ASM1.  At first I didn't like it,...I expected more of a consistent dark/serious theme through ASM2, as in ASM1.  But in hindsight, I think it makes sense now....Peter Parker/Spider-Man is at the height of his game, liked by the public, in love.....it only makes sense that his natural sense of humor should come through.  And it exists in the comics, so it's not as though the writers made it up.  Also, I think it balances the movie out, as (spoilers) the movie begins with the death of Peter's parents, and ends with Grew Stacey's death.  Some heavy stuff you don't always see in a superhero movie.

Lastly, beware of the movie trailer for ASM2, as it contains scenes and plot lines which were later cut from the film.  This definitely threw me off when I first viewed the movie in the theater, as I had certain expectations/theories going of where it was headed, what would happen, etc.  So if you are considering giving ASM2 a chance, then don't watch the trailer, or block it out of your mind.  If you do so, then I think you will enjoy what is a solid super-hero movie.",1416096000,,4712,4.828144458281445

6127971,2,B00H2FPY20,Overall the movie is Ok but it was let down by the ending as it was a sad ending as he lost his girlfriend. It has what one except from a Super Hero movie. I would prefer the older spider-man series.,1415059200,,199,3.8780487804878048
6127972,4,B00H2FPY20,"This film is far, far better than I expected it to be. Not great, and still not at the level of the first two Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire films, but not the mess that it has been made out to be. Of course, the action is fantastic and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have chemistry, but we already knew that from the first Amazing Spider-Man film. What that film lacked, and which this one thankfully doesn't lack, is a good overall plot, with a great ending. There are several story arcs, they work well individually, and they come together nicely at the end. Yes, Electro isn't a great character, but he looks cool and more importantly doesn't get in the way of the main story.

Long story short, this is not a horrible film, and that is coming from someone who thought that the 2012 was extremely weak. This is the best Spider-Man film since Spider-Man 2, and delivers a nice blend of human drama and superhero action. It's definitely worth watching, even if you (like me) felt that the last one wasn't.",1415059200,3,1000,4.4945054945054945

6128028,5,B00H2FPY20,"I was kicking myself for not seeing this in theaters. I was a huge fan of the first ASM and really wanted to see it but just couldn't find the time. Then I started hearing how it was a let down and people saying it was mediocre at best and not near as good as the older movies so kind of just put it off until it was out.

I'm glad I finally watched it though. I totally disagree with those people and would say this movie is just as good as the first, and both beat the previous trilogy by far.

The complaints I heard are totally unjustified in my opinion... I'm not a huge Jamie Foxx fan, but Elektro was done really well in my opinion, he did a good job. I don't know why people didn't like him except maybe because it was Jamie Foxx and he tends to have a love/hate fan base, probably the hate side being more prevalent in the demographic that would actually go watch this movie.

Another complaint I have heard is that there are too many villains or it was like they tried to cram too much in it... which I also don't see at all. Other than the occasional normal bad guy, the only real villain was Elektro. Sure there was the Green Goblin and Rhino, but they were more setting up the next movie than this movie. Goblin played a big role, but Harry is a big part of Peters life in general, one should expect he'd be there in some capacity and will be from now on probably.

Enough with the complaints: I will just say the Peter Gwen relationship in this movie is absolutely amazing and in itself deserves 5 stars. I am not going to spoil it but some of the things that happen between them instantly boosted this movie for me and should for anyone who watches.

If you like spider-man, peter and gwen, action, super heroes, or comics at all... you should like and watch this movie.",1414195200,,1785,4.192419825072887

Well, for one thing, the special effects were flawless.  At least to my eyes, they were.  For another, Jamie Fox looked like he could have really enjoyed more of his Max character before becoming Electro.

The movie was worth watching - once.  I won't be jumping up to be this again any time soon.  I'd recommend it with the caveat, ""Watch it if you're not expecting too much out of it.  That way you won't be disappointed"".",1413676800,,602,4.5

However, I thought Garfield was better this time around, especially when he was Spider-Man, and Emma Stone and he DO have an easy chemistry, for what it's worth.

Still, the movie WAS incredibly awful. There's virtually no plot, and for the first hour plus scenes seem to be laid out in completely random fashion, never building from one scene to the next or connecting any story threads together. This becomes understandable when you learn that Sony took the film away from Mark Webb in post and re-cut everything. Why, I have no idea. The movie reeks of studio interference, as they forced way too many elements into the proceedings as they very ill-advisedly attempt to turn the Spider-Man universe into their own Marvel-esque multi-franchise property.

The worst things in the movie are the villains. Electro is terrible: he starts out as a cartoon ""nerd"" straight out of Batman & Robin, then transforms into a CG mess with no motivation, and no plan. Ever. The whole movie, his plan is ""I hate Spider-Man."" And the Green Goblin was done so poorly that I was nostalgic for Willem Dafoe's Power Ranger Goblin from the first Sam Raimi flick. He also had no business being shoe-horned into the film, and was only done so to give us the iconic end sequence with Gwen Stacy, which was done in shoddy fashion and missed pretty much the entire point of that event in the comics.

So, not the worst movie (or even superhero movie) ever, but still really, really, really bad. Sony needs to free Spider-Man and let him return to the Marvel family. He's languishing by himself out there.",1413676800,,1869,4.689024390243903

I am a fan of Spider man 1 and 2, did not like 3, thought Amazing 1 was so-so, and absolutely detest this. By all accounts, this movie may kill several careers. Look at what Marvel is doing with Avengers, Thor, Cap Am, Xmen, etc....They are fantastic. Spidey deserves better, this is just junk. A major step backwards.

Why keep rebooting? Spiderman's world is vast enough to continue forward. Why the same story again? Sure there are tweaks, add something new!

6128085,4,B00H2FPY20,"Spoiler alert!

I took my son to see the latest offering in the Spiderman franchise. He is not as cynical as me yet, still young enough to be into the superhero thing. I got the spectacle I more or less expected: graphic effects so crystalline they were unreal, pointless violence, huge explosions. It isn't a bad piece of work for what it is, and if you are planning to see it yourself, you should stop reading now. I'll be giving away the ending in the next paragraph.

I did not expect an unhappy ending.

At the end of the film, the hero fails to save his girlfriend. We are all set up to expect a miraculous rescue. But he is just an instant too late, a fraction too slow. In short, he is human, and she pays the human price along with him. This is a theme of the movie: we make our choices and live or die with the consequences. We accept the risk of living. We accept the risk of trying to do something good. And we are all of us frail and vulnerable, even the eponymous hero of the franchise.

Throughout the story, Gwen Stacy wants to go into danger with Peter several times. They argue, he ultimately accepts her demand to be treated with dignity: the dignity of risk. She claims the right to choose danger, to accept the risk, to be free. Freedom comes with costs. In an earlier franchise (as well as in the ink version?) a direct link is made between power and responsibility; here we get to examine freedom in the same terms. Victor Frankl likely never expected to be in agreement with a cartoon character, but here we are: freedom and responsibility are two faces of one being, a Janus head creating the illusion of two beings.

In our clinical work, how careful are we to respect the dignity of risk inherent in each client or patient? To let them choose their own way whenever possible, even if that own way is risky, and even if that risk is very serious? Gwen pays the ultimate price for her freedom in this story, but it is Peter who suffers. Gwen is merely dead. Peter has to ruminate thereafter over his failure and his loss. To grapple with his limitations. His very human limitations.

In the end, the makers of this movie seem to be suggesting that there is something more important than success or failure: giving it all away. Trying. Making the effort. The person who stays on the straight, narrow path never does anything remarkable. And if we are boring sheep, evil wins. Winning against evil is not necessarily defeating evil; there will be evil always. Winning is doing all you can do to oppose it, standing up, even if this is costly. Especially if this is costly. Dying is not losing if one dies for something rather than for nothing.",1413417600,,2666,4.430612244897959

ELectro is far more powerful here than in the comics.  And the rhino is not a man in a exosuite. he's a mutant basically , superpowered man.  That was bad enough. They just needed to step back and be more like the comics. The film seems forced a bit < but it's still entertaining.  IT's a better film in 3d for sure as you get more of the depth and effects in that version.  So grab that version,  it's not a bad movie,  It's  a decent movie , but it's not as great as the earlier spiderman films, instead it's similar to the one with sandman which had too many storylines.

It felt a bit like someone just decided they had to keep throwing more and more in because they would not have the franchise that much longer.  And they made the serious mistake in a fantasy movie of feeling they could constantly violate their own rules.  I get it that it's comic book, but generally a good comic book/fantasy movie has certain things they allow to occur and otherwise tries to not go so unrealistic.

The mystery is a nice change from the Tobey Macguire/Sam Raimi films. Over all not great, but not terrible. A fun film.",1412640000,3,432,4.623376623376624

6128166,3,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was anything but amazing.  This is the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man where this time Peter Parker/Spider-Man must keep the city safe again as Oscorp sends a slew of super villains against him which will impact his life forever.  This time around Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner where in charge of writing the screenplay while they also where in charge of writing the screen story with the help of James Vanderbilt.  Marc Webb is back as director who did a decent job directing the first one.

After the aftermath and the promises that Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) made in Amazing Spider-Man he struggles with his ordinary obligations and his responsibilities of being Spider-Man.  During the opening scene he deals with a Aleksei Sysevich (Paul Giamatti) who is built up to be a ""big"" character later.  While chasing that criminal he saves an everyday citizen named Max Dillion (Jamie Foxx), we are shown that Max is not very well recognized and it affects him greatly. Then Peter and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) graduate high school and Peter is suppose to go celebrate with her but to honor a promise he doesn't go.  Back at Oscorp, where Max Dillion works, he is told he must stay late on his birthday to take care of a problem that has occurred.  While trying to fix the problem something happened and he was electrocuted and Electro emerges.  Then an old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns and becomes obsessed with Spider-Man because he realizes that Spider-Man has come in contact with some of the spiders that Harry and Peters dad were working on.  Harry has the same disease has his father does and is forced to figure out as quickly as possible a cure for it which he thinks is in the research his father has left him.  He comes up with an antidote and tests it on himself only to realize that it transforms him, and that is when he realizes that Peter is also Spider-Man.  Harry decides to now be known as the Green Goblin and now becomes Peters enemy because he wouldn't help him find a cure.  That is when Peter realizes that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp.

I was looking forward to this film after watching The Amazing Spider-Man and I have to say I was extremely disappointed.  There were too many villains jammed into the film with not enough story and no real connection other than Oscorp.  First the film starts off with chasing a bad guy down the streets of NY and when he gets caught he claims he will be back.  he will be back all right for maybe 5 seconds toward the end of the film.  Don't worry that doesn't spoil any of this movie because he doesn't play any part whatsoever in it.  Then Electro is the main villain in the film and they do a decent job with him but it's like having just him wasn't enough and they wanted more.  So in comes Harry Osbourne who we saw nothing of in the first film and in no time at all he goes from Harry's friend to Harry's enemy.  Take out Aleksei and Harry/Green Goblin and buff up the story of Electro and you could have had a blockbuster film.  Another option could have been to take Aleksei out and buff up Harry and Electro's stories because one or two villains work alot better than three.

Overall I would have to give this film a C.  The only thing that saves this film from getting worse is the special effects and the acting.  The group of actors worked really well together and the movie does flow well.  Also the special effects are amazing and live up to the movies name.  There will be a third installment but will I be rushing out to see it... probably not, unless they make some major improvements to the story and not try to cram so much into the film.",1412640000,,3698,4.464285714285714

I'm not clear why they felt the need to reboot so quickly, as if the Toby McGuire series was so terrible. I hesitated to watch this one, but my son was eager, but he didn't like it either.

6128256,2,B00H2FPY20,"I avoided this sequel for a long time not because I had hated the original ""Amazing Spiderman"" (I barely remember it) or out of reverence for Sam Raimi's trilogy (I liked the first two but I don't mind a reboot). No, I avoided the sequel mostly because nothing in the promotional material struck me as remotely interesting save for a few screen shots of Rhino and hints at a Sinister Six formation down the line.

After watching the film, I can say that the film played out exactly as I thought it would and my reaction was approximately what I figured it would be. The movie has all the eye candy sequences down and the general moral thrust of the Spider-man character still works (especially when a certain character makes their exit at the end), but the rest of the work is emotionally hollow; Harry, Electro, and most of the other heavies are either given little onscreen character development or are played for laughs (Electro was right out of a superhero movie parody).

The best scene in the movie was an expositional exchange between Peter and Aunt May where May airs her frustrations about Peter's parents and his fixation on them. This made the movie for me! It was one of the few times something felt real in the movie.

Electro was completely mistreated here as a villain. Not only is he given a lame backstory, his eventual turn to crime is so utterly stupid that I was beyond insulted; this is the sort of crap that used to get a pass back when comic movies were written for and by the functionally retarded. The last scene with Rhino is kind of neat, but I hated the saccharine crap with the little kid standing up to the GIANT WAR ROBOT before Spidey made his entrance. The whole thing was so sugary it made my teeth hurt.

Unfortunately, this was a missed opportunity with a few neat twists and performances thrown in. It's too bad, had the movie been a total crap-feet I might not be as annoyed as I am with it.",1411948800,,1929,4.471590909090909

6128262,5,B00H2FPY20,"I think that this movie is fantastic.  The storytellers took great care to further develop the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy.  This is the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2 (from the original movies starring Tobey MacGuire), in my opinion.  I love that the music score blends different music genres throughout the film.  The different genres of music are used at the right time.  It is done in a way that does not seem forced or inappropriate.  Movies are music and I thought that the visuals, music and the pace of the presentation lived up to that mantra in every respect.

The action scenes are incredible.  I have read a number of reviews that state that the special effects are ""ok"".  That is absurd.  The special effects are cutting edge and must have taken an incredible amount of effort to pull off.  I don't take issue with people that don't like the movie based on whatever storytelling criteria they choose to use.  It is impossible for all of us to like the same things.  That being said, the lukewarm reviews of the special effects are outright nonsense.  We should all hope to be as ambitious, creative and complete with our work as the special effects teams involved with bringing this movie to life.

I think this is an awesome movie.  The Amazing Sipider-Man 2 makes great use of time to attend to the main plot throughout the film.  The action accents the story in grand fashion.",1411862400,,1423,4.673387096774194

My biggest criticism of the movie is how the final cut came to play, (some more editing and pacing of the movie could of been better) and no appearance of Jonah Jameson. Acting was great, I truly felt the characters I've grown with in the comic.
Top special FX!
 Andrew Garfield vs Tobey McGuire as spiderman?
no question Andrew represents a better interpretation of the comic.
  Rate more like 4 1/2 stars than 5.

6128327,1,B00H2FPY20,"If you have any standards at all, you probably won't like this movie. Watch it if you're bored and you're curious about how bad it is, if you want. I certainly sat through all of it--while simultaneously describing how awful it is to my friend, the very first time I saw it. I hadn't read reviews or heard any feedback about the movie prior to watching it.

Honestly, I am genuinely shocked at how high of a rating this movie has thus far. At the very most, it deserves 2.5 stars. I would have assumed only a child could truly enjoy this film.

It started off promising. We got to see how and semi-why Peter's parents died. The acting was on the verge of bad. It wasn't quite full bad, but it was close. It was one of those moments where you could tell the actors were trying to put themselves in the part and hope they chose the right mannerisms and reactions for the emotional scene, rather than submerging us into the story so much that we viewed the actors as the characters they were playing. But, I thought the scene was good overall, and I didn't foresee it being a terrible a movie. I was wrong.

We are very early introduced to our villain: Max Dillon. I couldn't tell if he was meant to be autistic or not. I assumed he was, but I doubt he was meant to be. It would be pretty tasteless to make a poor autistic man a villain, especially in such the way that he was.

Max Dillon...what can I say? This is not a role Jamie Foxx can be proud of (I'm sorry Jamie). I feel like the director didn't guide him well, and for most of the actors, at that. He was obsessive, oblivious, had the worst dialogue, and literally had no fascinating/legitimate reason to become a villain. I was baffled at his home scene. My eyebrows were wrinkled and my head was tilted with the expression of ""what, really?"" :/ ""They REALLY made him act like this?"" He's too goofy, and from that moment on, I could not take the movie seriously.

Furthermore, he was a Spider-Man fanboy, until during a confrontation after his freak accident, he suddenly becomes murderous because Spider-Man doesn't remember his name. lol....LOL Of all the plots imaginable, our villain, who had no previous violent behavior or tendencies, wants to take revenge on Spider-Man because he didn't remember his name.

Sure, you can argue that it was much deeper than a name, but it was poor development and storytelling, and his transitioning point was truly stupid. All we know of Max's personality is that he was a goofy, harmless autistic man who wanted to be noticed. He underwent a freak accident and in an instant his personality went from one extreme to the next because Spider-Man didn't remember his name. Got it.

This movie used a lot of cliches. I'm not completely against cliches, especially if they're done right, but this was not done right. Our villain undergoes a freak accident and acquires impossible abilities. I don't know whether or not this particular villain was in the comics, but in this rendition of comics-translated-to-film, it did not work. I was tired of the predictable, lackluster story and done-before villain. Think of something new, or execute it well. Neither was achieved.

Also, how do biting eels turn a man into a walking sparky blue guy who can dissipate and reform via electrical cables? WTF? No. Oh, what's that? It was done in a scientific laboratory location? Oh, ok, that makes it plausible now.

Some other gripes of mine are the overuse of dubstep and inappropriately-timed classical music. Much of the music was good, but the dubstep felt overused and too prominent. I don't consider scenes that interact with dubstep drops and raises as serious or appropriate given the content. Moreover, there is a scene where a classical masterpiece is used during the weird-scientist-with-an-obviously-fake-over-the-top-accent; it was a pathetic attempt to be humorous.

Overall acting, oh gosh. The dialogue was frequently uninspired, one-dimensional, and often awkward. Andrew and Emma have great chemistry, but that was overshadowed by cheesy one-liners and awkward dialogue. I cringed so much throughout these scenes. Also, Andrew repeats the same words far too much and sometimes mumbles his lines. I gather he's trying to come across natural and imperfect, but his deliveries were frequently poop and even hard to understand.

I hate to say this about Sally Field, because she is a pioneer in acting, but I felt the same about her as I did with the actors who played Peter's parents. I saw Sally trying to act, rather than seeing Peter's aunt. Their scenes together were awkward, forced, and they felt cringey because I was so embarrassed for them.

Sadly, the few good things I did like about the movie were just simply not enough to keep it afloat. I liked the music, it was really good, it just didn't mesh with the film. I liked the special effects and action too, but a good movie meant to tell a story can't survive on special effects alone. Lastly, I thought Emma Stone and Dane DeHann were the best in terms of acting and likability, despite their sometimes bad dialogue and character direction. (Although, I am on the fence about Dane's makeup and hair as the Goblin.)

In conclusion, the pleasant points are: Emma Stone and Dane DeHaan's acting, the music (as a separate entity), and special effects. None of which can redeem this movie's horrendous plot and poorly directed actors.

6128329,3,B00H2FPY20,"As with the previous installments of Spider-Man (the loathsome Toby McGuire/James Franco/Kirsten Dunst trilogy, which I abhor) the creative team here fell into that old hackneyed pit of self destruction when they decided to inflate the cast of characters way beyond what one movie should allow (see all of the Batman movies after the first Tim Burton-directed opus).  I had so much hope for this franchise.  The first movie really appealed to me because it didn't do what this movie did, which is throw out so many plot lines like scattered webs (pun definitely intended) to become tedious.  Any reader of Spider-Man knew that Gwen Stacy was going to die, so that shouldn't come as any surprise.  If it does, oops!  You didn't read anything... Other things bug as well.  The CGI is absolutely stunning. But that doesn't make a good movie (listen up Hollywood!) and tends to underscore the fact that the acting isn't up to par.  We are introduced to Harry Osborn.  Who becomes the Green Goblin (hmmmmm, thought he was the HobGoblin?) after injecting some of the stored spider venom at OsCorp that transformed Peter into Spider-Man.  We also have the introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) who is just a brilliant but nerdy OsCorp drone who, by misfortune, gets severely electrocuted (if electrocution in itself is not severe enough) while trying to fix a situation at OsCorp.  We also get a glimpse of the costumes for Vulture, Doc Oct and of course Rhino (who is thrown into the end and portrayed by Paul Giamatti).  Ugh!  The script is ham-handed.  There are too many villainous plots.  The whole time Peter is still toying with his twisted romance of Gwen, trying to abide by his Aunt May and dwelling on the disappearance of his parents.  Ok.  Wow.  Also, the slo-mo fight/rescue sequences should be barred from film. Matrix and 300 used them and everyone else copied them. And now they're clich and annoying.

Bottom line.  This movie annoyed where it should have amazed.  Even Stan Lee's cameo was so pointless as to be irritating (where his other Hitchcockian-esque appearances we at least amusing). Hollywood gets a hold of a Spider-Man or a Superman or Batman and they have to try and tell us how terribly straining it is to be that character.  It's been beaten to death.  No one needs another director's interpretation of it.  We already went through it with the previous franchises of all those characters. Move on. Pick a plot and stick to it.  Is it so hard to stick to one villain? Or is there a rush to jam as many Marvel baddies into one flick just knowing that eventually this series is going to crash and burn?  I've learned to live with the poor adaptations of Marvel characters (especially the villains usually contorted backstories) and release my hold on the actual comics. Most of the great Spider-Man baddies were created in the 60s and are kind of campy to begin with, so I get that. But what's the obsession with Harry Osborn and the Green Goblin?  He wasn't even one of Spider-Man's biggest rivals.
Anyway.  In the age of the new CGI-encrusted Hollywood, we take what we can get, right?  Story and acting are sacrificed for eye-popping visual effects.  Plots are thin or horribly tangled.  There are some good ones (Captain America, X-Men, perhaps the first two Iron Man movies) and there are some bad.  You be the judge of those.  Thor is definitely coming to mind.  I liked the first Amazing Spider-Man because it was an honest reboot.  This one has clearly fallen victim to the success of the first movie and has transformed into a grandiose spectacle of Hollywood-retarded tripe.

6128339,5,B00H2FPY20,"I know this movie has been given a lot of flak by people but I don't really understand why.  This movie was awesome.  I love the chemistry between Andrew Greenfield and Emma Stone (probably helps that they're dating in real life).  I thought Jamie Foxx was great as Electro and Dane DeHaan played a believable Harry Osborn/Green Goblin.  The action and romance was perfectly balanced and you can really connect to what the characters are going through.  Even though I feel this series is a lot better than the Sam Raimi films, I think this Spiderman series holds up on its own and doesn't even need to be compared anymore.  Maybe people don't like it because they kill off Gwen Stacy but that's what happens in the comic books and I like that they don't make the films too kid friendly.  This movie is definitely number one for my top 5 of the summer in front of The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy (both of which I enjoyed).  My only hope is that Marc Webb continues to make the series enjoyable and entertaining.  There's not many movies that make me cry but the end of this one is definitely a tearjerker.",1411344000,,1119,4.472906403940887

It's still an entertaining adventure with some great dialogue and emotional scenes.  The fight scenes are pretty awesome as well, and they really pay homage to the comics here.  It is a shame that the main focus is to make room for a ""Sinister Six"" sequel at the expense of this movie's plot; however, I hope it really pays off in the end with the inevitable Amazing Spiderman 3.

Unfortunately for me as a life long Spider-Man fan and reader, the ending of the film did NOT diverge from the comic ending, and I had to relive that trauma again. Is it strange to feel for characters who are not real? Perhaps, but I have known them for many years and it still stings today. It's even worse now because it was immortalized in film and not merely as pictures and words on a page. A can't miss classic that I loved and feared for over 2 hours. If you enjoyed the first film with Garfield as Spider Man, then you absolutely will not be disappointed with this one either.

6128363,3,B00H2FPY20,"Ugh, the sophomore slump. Did the opening of this movie remind anyone of the opening of Superman 3, with a whole sequence of goofy slapstick that just seemed odd and out of place? Also, the Jamie Foxx character kind of recalls the clumsy awkwardness of Richard Pryor in Superman 3. I get that they are going for the same tone as the comics but the ""woo hooyahh ahhh haaa heythere, howbout a little of this....woop hey lemmegrabthatrealfast...yeehaa oop ok, got that...herewego take this...uh oh...whoah yayy"" kind of shtick is painfully conspicuous. I find it difficult to write a full, analytical review of this film, but I have to refer to the cliched fall back claim that it just doesn't all come together very well. There was some interesting stuff between Peter and Norman Osborne, but the re-imagining of the green goblin is awkwardly obvious, and the development of Electro as a super villain silly and a little confusing. Also, in the comics, the death of Gwen Stacey is really a seminal event, but here it is very poorly set up. Anyway, here's hoping the creative team can rediscover the smooth development of the next film.",1411084800,,1133,4.815384615384615

If you like Spider-Man, I find it likely that you'll enjoy this immensely as it's easily the best Spider-Man film to date (in my opinion, of course).  The cast gave strong performances, the story was gripping, and the humor was so very Spider-Man.  If you don't like Spider-Man, I don't know what you're doing here.  Do you?

A bit off topic but to the person who thinks plutonium-239 isn't explosive, you may want to edit your review.  It's not only highly explosive but one of the most common isotopes used in nuclear fission weapons: ""Nuclear weapons typically contain 93 percent or more plutonium-239..."" (Encyclopedia Britannica). At least the filmmakers did some homework.  Be careful what reviews you read.

The film touts Electro as the main antagonist but he isn't in it enough to live up to that title. The story with Peter's parents isn't engaging and should have never been in this series. The Green Goblin is shoe horned into the last few minutes of the film when it should have been the focus of the entire film. The problem is that it had too much going on and didn't have enough time for any sort of development. If it had focused on either Electro or Goblin it would have worked. Problem is they tried to do both and as a result failed at both. There was a lot of promise here too. The action was great, Electro could have been good with more screen time and development and the romance between Peter and Gwen is quite good.

That being said, i wasn't too fond of The Amazing Spider-Man 1 , when it came out in theatres, and i eventually gambled and bought it on Blu Ray, to say the least, i was less than satisfied with the original TASM, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivers. They're is quite a bit of character development, and the plot seems to draw onto out Hero's feelings toward another female character, that shouldn't be unfamiliar to veterans of the first movie. It draws on. But in the long run, makes for some comical, and romantic sequences between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, that you may or may not cared for. Nevertheless, it all builds up to a fantastic climax, with great special effects and a strong comic nostalgia, i can whole-heartedly recommend The Amazing Spider-Man 2.",1410652800,,896,4.571428571428571

6128487,2,B00H2FPY20,"I had to check my channel a few times to make certain that I hadn't accidentally turned to The CW. I could have easily been convinced that Andrew Garfield beat out Justin Bieber for the lead role given his slicked-back, cheesy depiction of Spider-Man. I've read reviews comparing this to Spider-Man 3, which is understandable given that it was the most superficial of the first three, but I propose that the Batman & Robin film starring George Clooney serves as a more appropriate comparison.  If Garfield's Spider-Man suit had nipples, the similarities would be all the more apparent. Having watched the first Amazing Spider-Man in the theater, I don't consider myself a hater of the franchise; actually, far from it. I simply felt that the chemistry between Garfield and Stone that I thoroughly enjoyed in the first film is nowhere to be found in the sequel.  In addition, there are moments when I felt as if Garfield was intentionally doing a bad impersonation of Sylvester Stallone, a stereotypical depiction of a New Yorker.  Emma Stone essentially played the blonde bombshell; not much more.  I could go on to discuss Jamie Foxx's cartoonish depiction of Electro and the waste of Paul Giamatti as The Rhino, but I won't bother.  Oh... and poor Sally Field playing a somewhat hip Aunt May.  The depiction of Harry Osborn by Dane DeHaan initially felt uninspired but became more nuanced as the character transformed into the Green Goblin; yet, nothing can compensate for the pathetic ending.

Not going to review the film itself. Either watch it or don't that is up to you as a comic book, cartoon fan. What I will comment on is the packaging of this set.

The movie comes with 3 disc based versions of the film and the HD digital copy. So thats 4 copies, and its 4K mastered, I am still at 1080p with my TV but thats nice, 1st film I won't have to buy again one day.

The only con with digital copies is that they are not uniform in your selection options. I have 108 digital titles in my iTunes library, then came UV. I just don't care for UV at all vs iTunes in this area. Especially since my entire movie collection of digital titles are with iTunes.

6128508,5,B00H2FPY20,"Great movie. Andrew Garfield does an amazing job in both The Amazing Spider-Man movies. He is the Spider-Man we have all been waiting for. He brings to the movie a funny Spider-Man as well as a hero who can kick some butt. That is how the real Spider-Man is in the comics and video games. The villains are amazing. Jamie Fox does an amazing job of playing Electro and in the movie he is a complete bad a**. Green Goblin was good too. His wicked laugh and voice make him a little scary and intimidating, which is how Green Goblin actually is. He's not a wimp like in the Tobey Maguire version of Spider-Man. As for Rhino, Rhino is a complete wimp. So, who cares if him and Spider-Man don't actually fight until the very end of the movie. Oh and also a little word of advice. The new Spider-Man movies are a mixture of two Spider-Man comic book storylines. In one of the storylines Gwenn Stacy is Spider-Man's first love and not Mary Jane. Gwenn Stacy also dies in one of those storylines in a very similar way that she dies in this movie. To me her death in this movie was easily predictable. One of the storylines is about the death of Peter's parents and how he becomes Spider-Man to unravel the mystery of their deaths, which is what the first two movies focus on. If you are not familiar with the comic book storylines there is a good chance you will not like this movie or the first movie.",1410393600,,1393,4.320610687022901

6128519,1,B00H2FPY20,"How bad was ASM 2? Lets take all the things bad about ASM 1 (piss poor direction, choppy continuity, lapses of logic and a simply bad casting choice of emo cool ADD  Garfield for Peter Parker), then add a terrible script, unconvincing character development, even worst plot lines and add the line, Its my birthday, Spiderman, shake it up and you got one of the worst superhero movies ever made.  Simply put, ASM2 is the Batman and Robin of the new millennium. Thats how bad.

I never thought I would say this, but Jamie Foxx, with his Oscar accolades and such, made for one of the goofiest, most ridiculous villains I could ever recall. Some of the ideas for the film were simply ludicrous. Foxx is an engineer working for a major corporation like OSCORP, and at the end of the day, hes the only one left to maintain the entire power grid? Theres no 24/7 back up team to support a major corporation? In the end, the problem turns out to be a simple unplugged extension cord, which happens to be under a vat of electric eels in water? Uummmits pretty stupid to have a vat of water underneath electrical wiring, don't you think? So many more instances like this in this film.

Dane Dehaan was about the only good thing about this movie, and even then, he wasn't given enough to flesh out his character. The death of Gwenvery anticlimactic, with no emotional resonance whatsoever.

If the Sony executives had half a brain after this disaster, they should fire Marc Webb and prevent him from creating another incoherent over blown CGI mess.  Webb is simply the new McG.

A news report today stated that Andrew Garfield felt that ASM2 would have been better had they put back the scenes from the cutting room floor. Believe me folks, NO extra footage would have saved this movie. Its a disaster of all disasters. And its still steaming and foul after several months.

Giamatti was completely wasted and WTF was that 'Rhino' Costume? They never used Norman Osborne as the Green Goblin. went right to Harry. Using the Iconic Story of Amazing Spiderman 121,122 , while changing almost everything , except Gwens look, was near sacrilidge to Old Amazing fans like me. Plus, what's with having the titles at the end of movies, is this the new 'in' thing? The costume was better this time for Spiderman and Electro was OK, except you never get to understand why he hates Spiderman?

6128612,5,B00H2FPY20,"The Movie: This is a great movie, despite what some reviewers on the internet think. I find Andrew Garfield more or less perfected the correct attitude behind Spider-man, which is to have fun with taking out the baddies. It's not like high-quality humor, it just makes him seem a lot more fun as a character. I think the character of Harry Osbourne is really well done, and the dynamic between Gwen and Peter is as good as ever. The two main villains are fairly well paced, and while it sometimes feels like it's jumping from scene to scene, I think each was given enough time to really get to know the characters. I will say this though, the advertising team really messed up with how much they promoted Rhino based on how much he's in the movie, it feels like that's the reason people think this is overcrowded with villains.

The Product: This come well packaged with a nice shiny cover with embossed text. This one comes with the DVD, the Blu-Ray disc, and a code to let you view it online or download it with UltraViolet. The Blu-ray definitely has a lot more features, and the majority of the deleted scenes are not included in the DVD disc (I'm not exactly sure why they did that, it could be because the DVD did not have enough space?). I'm also glad when movies come with director commentaries, so that's a definite plus.

Spiderman seems to be flying high as the movie opens, stopping Paul Giamatta from stealing plutonium, while saving Jamie Foxx from being squashed. Foxx develops an unhealthy Spiderman fixation, until he falls into a vat filled with electric eels while holding a high voltage power-line and the next thing you know - Hey, Presto! - he's got control over electricity. Meanwhile, Peter Parker's friend from high school, Harry Osborn, inherits both his father's business and his father's genetic disease, and wants Spiderman blood to create a cure. When Spiderman rejects this demand for Harry's safety - it turns out that Peter's father and Harry's father created the mutated spiders using only Parker DNA (What are the odds of that coincidence, and what does it mean?) - Harry turns bitter against Spiderman. When Harry teams up with Electro and gets a sample of the spider venom, quicker than you can say ""Green Goblin,"" Spiderman has a new high-flying enemy.

Where is Paul Giamatti's Rhino?  Mostly absent, until the last couple of minutes, which is a shame given Paul Giamatti's acting chops.

Bad, bad, and bad. It's messy, there's too many plot lines going on, they're trying to fit too much into one movie.  The thing is half of those plot lines we never asked for I don't understand why they would introduce this turmoil that Spiderman's aunt is going through, or why his girlfriend has all the issues. It seems like everybody had their own reality show going on in this film. It was kind of forcing us to care with overacting and trying to suck us in, but none of it was a draw for me.

Having said that, Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man almost fits the  vision of my hero.
Sam Raimi's  version of Spider-Man captured much of the essence and heart  of the comic books but left out the intelligence of Peter Parker and his  creation of the webshooters.
What the Garfield version makes up in comic book  accuracy (mechanical webshooters and Gwen Stacey) simply lacks in Spidey's original character flaws, weaknesses and heroic attributes.
In the early comics it was constantly made clear that Peter felt an profound obligation to his Aunt May while doing battle against many villains. See issues 32-33 of the Amazing Spider-Man.
I suspect that no one of the current era can appreciate the Peter Parker of the 60s. I understand that; although it does pain me.

Well, if you look at how the fight was set up you'd know the director wanted to end the movie on a high note, all amped up. I read a lot of reviews before I rented this film, I did not see it in theaters, and when it came to the end I got it. I understood the set up. It doesn't 'just end'. So don't let those reviews lead you to think the movie is going along and `BAM' it just stops. You will see for yourself how it was done and I feel it was set up brilliantly.

It is almost like the old Spiderman 3 with too many characters. Story develops pretty well with good logic but the climax falls short.
There is almost no relationship between Electro and Harry but they somehow joined together to fight Spiderman. I really don't think Harry had a good reason to kill Spierman, just to take blood from him, even though he knows he is going to die.

All the actors performs at their top-level but the connection and uniqueness of the film falls short.
If you want to watch a same old spierman movie with a family, it might be okay.
However, I really don't see any thrill or action because the CG and Graphics made Spiderman and Electro look like a toy.

Not sure if the studio got its fingers into this too much or what, but the writing here is awful and there was as much emotion in it as a piece of stale bread.  Definitely not like the more unified vision shown in the first of this reboot series, but rather a bucket of mixed ideas slopped out onto the screen.  A couple great, some decent, but most pretty bad.  Even many of the effects looked so fake they take you right out of the fantasy.  Still watchable, though.

6128722,3,B00H2FPY20,"While I wasn't initially excited about having this franchise rebooted so soon, I did enjoy THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN even if it did rehash the same old origin story that fans are all too familiar with. Here, the sequel is bigger but not quite to its advantage. First off, I'll say that Andrew Garfield is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even if he's not quite an awkward, geeky character, he at least has the wisecracking down to a 't.' Emma Stone also does an excellent job as Gwen Stacy. And the relationship between her and Peter is done rather well. In general, the cast gives good performances, with a couple of big exceptions though. The special effects are also top-notch, and Electro has a few scenes to show off his powers that really impressed me, even on my laptop.

 However, the area where this film falls short is the script. I'm no fan of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and they deliver an overstuffed narrative that tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, to the point where several of them feel shoehorned in as fan service. For this film to have been effective, Electro should have been the sole villain. You would have thought that Sony learned their lesson with Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 3, but they obviously didn't. Green Goblin's introduction (and one of its consequences) feels rushed and tacked on to the end, while Rhino was completely superfluous. And to make matters worse, Paul Giamatti completely hams it up in the worst way possible.

 To touch on a couple other things, the plot is so unwieldy that certain scenes stick out as the contrivances they are, merely excuses for characters to meet and exchange information, or for exposition. Overall, this movie's greatest sin is that it tried to do too much and as a result it was a good half-hour too long. Certain characters and subplots could have been left out so that more time could be devoted to fleshing out the main story. In the end, what you're left with is a visually impressive comic book movie that feels like a stepping stone to something else, in this case a Sinister Six movie. If you're a fan of these movies, or the Spider-Man character, just go ahead and see it if you haven't already. For everyone else, just stick to Sam Raimi's trilogy.",1409702400,15,2248,4.697969543147208

6128743,1,B00H2FPY20,"I generally hate reboots, and even the term ""reboots"". (Aside: a notable, wonderful exception was Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series.) So, I resisted seeing the first movie in this franchise. Once I did, I actually enjoyed it a great deal. So, I had high hopes for this film. All those hopes were dashed.

Without giving away plot points, it is thoroughly hopeless, depressing, had a pointless ending, and did the now-familiar ""super villain pile-on."" (One villain isn't enough for today's audiences; let's cram in three.)  I couldn't relate to any of the various crises, which seemed forced and which often had fairly easy, obvious solutions (when they were resolved at all). The effects tended to  look fake and clumsy on a TV, and even some of Spidey's wisecracks seemed trite and goofy.

I can't say much more without spoilers. I'll conclude by saying that if you liked the first movie, don't assume you'll like this one...they are VERY different from one another. I myself will wait for the next reboot...and I certainly won't hurry into the theatre for that one.",1409616000,4,1072,4.938888888888889

So...with expectations low, the family and I set into watching the second installment of this Spider-Man series.  I have to say...it's really not that bad.  The biggest plot ""hole"" I found dealt with the Harry Osborn storyline, but even that line had some bit of payoff for the movie.  There's some great emotional moments in the movie that I think are all pulled off quite nicely that provide the necessary depth the movie needed for audiences investing in the characters and the story.  It's evident everyone has matured here and so it didn't feel like another ""Peter's still an infant trying to be Spider-Man"".

Did you know Oscorp, a company dedicated to scientific research abandons their experiments when the work day is over? Electro would never have been if not for this. ""Can you please turn off the power grid in sector 4?"" ""Sorry, I'm out for the day."" Really? No wonder that place has so many horrible lab accidents. As for the purpose of the experiment being run that created Electro it's never said. The idea that the experiment could even have created Electro is laughable in and of itself.

Harry Osborn takes the reins as the Green Goblin without his father having been so first.

He has so many other characters to direct his fury towards other than Spider-Man.  And Harry Osborn is boringly predictable. I fear this could halt an otherwise effective recharge of a franchise that had been poorly casted  in the Tobey Maguire series.  I want to see a third edition with Andrew Garfield.

This movie, compared to the first one. Is much more longer, which is a BIG +. The movie is funny, the movies sad, the action scenes are FREAKIN FANTASTIC.

The way it ended was great too, as you know. No matter what may happen to his life (Parker's), he knows he can't let that stop him. Spidey always has a responsibility.

I follow the Earth-616 series, never the ultimate series. As what this is based off of, but regardless of that fact. If you're a comic book fan, an action/ adventure lover, a romantic movie lover, a comedy lover...

Then you'd be pleased by this movie. The way I've watched it. I've watched the first one, then the second one right after. I would recommend watching it that way.

6128826,3,B00H2FPY20,"I just got through watching Amazing Spiderman 2, not too bad, but not too good either. You see the whole franchise is being rushed and sped up to make a profit. Now Hollywood can do this, but at a price of character development, plot lines and fan alienation like myself who did not bother going to the theatre to see this, because they are losing the basic principal of the comic book story. Spiderman is a classic and beautiful comic book creation, however with this movie and Spiderman 3, its up there with the ones I'd rather forget. I have a couple of pet peeves about this movie one is my favorite Spiderman villain (The Rhino) I was truly happy to hear he was in this movie and finally getting his first adaptation for the big screen. Boy, was I let down his character appearance was short and also a train wreck. Furthermore, did the director and producers even do their home work on the characters back story? In the comics The Rhino is powered by Gamma Rays and he has a suit built for him that can pretty much penetrate and destroy any thing in It's path, and even with out the suit The Rhino is still strong and powerful because he himself has been hit by Gamma Rays I mean his story goes on and on. In this film they had him in some dumb ugly tank like monstrosity of the suit. No, offense to Paul Giamatti he's a great actor his talent was wasted here. Jamie foxes character of Electro was actually decent in this movie, I'm not saying great or Oscar award winning decent, but just decent passable if you will. In the comics when Gwen Stacey died it was dramatic and tragic it was felt throughout the comic book community they even ask the writers of the Spiderman comics at that time and Stan Lee why she had to die off, I mean that was big news in the comic book universe back then. However, in this film when she dies It's boring and instead of shock and sadness we get a YAWN! And also what's with the Green Goblins character he looked nasty and greasy, he looked like he just escaped from the mental ward and burned his face on the way out! Once again no consideration for character enhancement another botched job by Hollywood. Spiderman, himself Andrew Garfield did a passable job also but was it just me or did his Brooklyn accent keep coming and going at certain times in the film? The graphics where cool I can say that, the film started off action packed and then lagged in some areas but other then the it was good movie but i'll stay home for the next installment I'm somewhat disappointed overall.",1409443200,2,2525,4.374468085106383

The reasons behind his hatred towards him was so stupid! Rhino was just false advertisement! he was in the movie for 2 minutes!!! Also the Osborne's never had a Genetic illness that kills them!? Electro never turned into Electro by electric eels?! Norman Osborne Kills Gwen Stacy! Not harry!, Rhino doesn't wear a robotic suit! Doc Ock created the sinister six!!! NOT HARRY!!!SO many things were awful! and that deleted scene of peters father LOL what in the FUCK were they thinking?!?!? LOL also they left some really good scenes on the cutting room floor!

6128845,4,B00H2FPY20,"There is something wonderful happening in movies today that some may notice but not understand. What it is is the emergence of comic books as solid story telling becoming movies that are equally as good. For years reading comics was something everyone thought only kids did. Now we have enormous amounts of people attending comic conventions across the country as well as movies that are not only raking in big bucks at the box office but presenting films that are actually better than most.

Perhaps the biggest studio and comic book company to cash in on this is Marvel. Their initial Spider-man movies were box office bonanzas. When they brought in Iron Man and the Avengers things got better. With the reboot of Spider-man people were wondering if they could capture the same magic all over again. The answer was yes. Now they continue that with the second Spider-man movie aptly titled THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2.

Having taken up the mantle of hero in the first film and defeating the Lizard, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) continues to be the good guy on the streets of New York. The film opens with him chasing down an Eastern European thug (Paul Giamatti) and his gang as they attempt to steal nuclear material from an Oscorp armored truck. Even though Spider-man captures them he's plagued by images of Capt. Stacy (Denis Leary), the father of the girl he's fallen in love with, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Each time he thinks he sees him he's reminded of his promise to steer clear of Gwen and to keep her out of harm's way.

In short order Peter tries to break things off with Gwen while at the same time dealing with several new problems. The first involves his old friend Harry Osborne (Dane DaHaan) who has returned home to his dying father. After he passes he's faced with trying to run Oscorp while at the same time battling a hereditary disease, the same his father died from. The only good thing in his life is his friend, Peter.

Oscorp has other issues to contend with that will also have consequences for Spider-man. Inventor and electrical tech Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) has fallen into a vat of super charged electric eels coupled with electrical transformers that have changed him from a normal person into an electrically charged human being. Captured he blames Spider-man for his being held captive by Oscorp and looks for a chance to face off against him again.

Through all of this Parker continues to hide his secret from his aunt May (Sally Field), discovers more secrets involving his parents and their ties to Oscorp and possibly has the solution to Harry's disease. But of course we know the last won't happen and Harry will try and do something to cure himself that will result in...well watch and see.

As always the effects here take center stage and make this movie a dazzling visual smorgasbord of high flying leaps and web swinging action. More than just the spider effects are those of the villain that Max becomes, Electro, and his ability to control electricity along with his electrical appearance. IF that weren't enough you later have...well I already said I wouldn't spoil that for folks who haven't seen the movie yet.

Right beside the action in this story is that of the affection between Peter and Gwen, a more human than hero story. It has always been one of the things that separated the Marvel comics from all others, this human side to every story being told. It weaves in and out of the action going on here and presents one of the biggest and most emotional surprises ever seen in a super hero movie.

I know there are people out there who sit and say to themselves ""Do you expect me to believe this?"" My mother is one of those. But that shouldn't prevent you from finding enough fun and story in this film to bypass it. Give it a try and my guess is you'll then anxiously anticipate number 3. Or maybe see GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (which is fantastic by the way). In any event, you may soon find yourself becoming a comic book movie fan. .",1409356800,,3989,4.632248939179632

6128851,1,B00H2FPY20,"This is the worst superhero movie that I have ever seen.

How can someone take the great Spiderman series made in last decade and ruin it so badly?

Why do the antagonists hate the Spiderman in this movie? The Green Goblin doesn't like him because Spiderman refuses  to donate his blood (for Green Goblin's sake!). So the Green Goblin wants his ""revenge"" and kill Spiderman. Hahaha are you kidding me??? Whoever wrote that dog of a script should be fired.

I still don't understand how Electro could be a fan of Spiderman and then suddenly change his mind 2 seconds later and tries to kill him. Now THAT'S what I call changing one's mind in an electric flash. Then, the Green Goblin makes Electro his ally simply by saying ""I need you"" three times, which seems to turn Electro into his puppy dog.  Hahaha....at that point the movie is turning into a big fart. Maybe what Electro needs is not more electricity but some more anti-psychotic medications.

Even the action sequences, which are clearly CGI fakes, are tiresome to watch. There is nothing new or fresh. Still, the fake CGI is the best part of the movie.

The love relationship between Peter and Gwen is even more faker than the fake CGI action. ""I am leaving you because I love you"", says Gwen to Peter. Oh wow. Now that makes the movie so much more real. Insult the audience's intelligence all you can without any restraint please. I was laughing at the dialogue throughout this atrocious movie.

And don't forget the little kid at the last sequence. Somehow, a little kid manages to try to fight a Rhino Robot (yes you heard that right). Hahahaha...I guess that is to please the 8 year olds watching this film. That really put an icing on the cake for a movie that only 8-12 year olds could love.

It is clear to me that the whole current Amazing Spiderman series is in the hands of incapable producers, directors, and writers. That's unfortunate. They should all be sent to jail so they won't make amazingly annoying movies like this again.

The last Spiderman series starring Tobey McGuire, while not perfect, was far more humane and believable. The characters, especially the love relationship between Peter Parker and May Jane, seemed real. That series focused on what made Spiderman great, which wasn't his supernatural abilities, but his willingness to sacrifice his own interest for the good of others.  In contract, this movie just seems to be about a lovesick teenager with way too much power in his hands.

Why would a lovesick teenager try to save the world when all he REALLY cares about is his girlfriend? Everyone in this film, including the Spiderman, is an idiot. And that was hard to watch.

This movie was so bad I was laughing sarcastically at the end while trying to stay awake.

Pros:
1)Every character, including the Spiderman, is an idiot and that makes you feel much smarter.
2)Every character becomes murderous after being just a little ticked off and that makes you feel much better about the society we live in.
3)Fake CGI makes you appreciate the older movies when action sequences actually involved footages of people.
4)Makes you appreciate Spiderman 3 (last Tobey Mcguire Spiderman) a little more.

Cons:
1)Insults everyone's intelligence without hesitation
2)It seems every character wants to kill Spiderman without a reason. ""You don't want to donate me your blood? Now I am going to kill you Spiderman!"" says the Green Goblin. Hahahaha...ROFL. Please spare me.
3)The ""I need to grow up because all I care about is my girlfriend"" lovesick teenage Spiderman is plain annoying. Superheros should have bigger concerns than their sex lives! Give me the slightly more mature version of Spiderman.
4)The script should have been eaten by a dog before production. Unfortunately, it wasn't.",1409356800,9,3775,4.831007751937984

Now he looks like the comic book version (which I really didn't think was required, as none of the other heroes look like their comic book versions) - and now.... it feels like a comic book.  Ugh.

Spider-man 2 was the greatest Spider-man movie... and it seems that this movie can't even get close to it.  Sam Raimi did a pretty silly version of Peter's school.. but at least It looked like New York.  This just looks like 50 years in the future with classic New York vehicles.

Also, why is every police car polished to a perfect shine?  Have these people even been to New York?

Good thing too, as the beginning has really nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  I thought the rest of the movie was great.  Good action, very good humor, the romance, While their acting was good, i was just so tired of the spiderman-maryjane plots from the previous films, that i had to fast forward some of these rather long, dulling scenes of Gwen and Spiderman.  While watching the movie, it helps if you think of it as a cartoon.  It definitely has cartoon physics and semi-science, which i throughly enjoyed.  And the adding of the Green Goblin at the end just about ruined it again for me.  This was the only tie in to Peter's father, and i found it rather un-stimulating.  Too many plots.

What ever happened to a one-on-one movie experience?  And why is it always Spiderman who has to deal with the multi-villain movie installments?  One, MAYBE two villains per movie is acceptable.  More than two is just overkill, over-stimulating, and overwhelming.  The fact that none of the villains in this second installment of ASM had ANY development as characters just...bothered me.

SPOILERS AHEAD

Electro got most of the ""villain"" screentime, and even so, his attitude shift was unexplainable and his motivation nonexistent.  He went from loving to hating Spidey in the span of a single scene.
Harry Osborne appears from nowhere and we barely experience the relationship that has supposedly existed between he and Peter all along.  Hmm...and oh, by the way, he's also dying of the same obscure, unnamed disease as his father.  Only one thing can save him: Spiderman's blood.  Go figure.  But when Spiderman personally explains that it's not safe to hand over his blood, but he'll help Harry find another way, Harry flies into a rage and hates Spiderman.  Then he turns into the Green Goblin and attacks Peter's girlfriend in revenge...

I'm also very sick of people attacking superheroes' girlfriends when they're pissed off.

And then, in the last minute and a half of the movie, we meet, or, rather, re-meet the Rhino.  In a bad-CGI rendition of a rhino-esque robot, complete with Paul Giamatti's floating head.  No backstory, no motive, he's just suddenly there, tearing up the streets.

Because it's a Marvel movie, and even more because it's an ASM franchise, I will watch whatever they have planned next.  But I've got to say one more thing, and then I'll go.
I'm going to miss Emma Stone.  She REALLY helped this franchise.",1409097600,2,1899,4.965079365079365

It takes Electro all of about 5 seconds to go from 'I love spidey' to 'I hate spidey'. Very believable. The entire movie is just a vehicle to jump from one bitchin' CGI scene to the next. There is actually a german-doctor-type who has a thick accent, wears rubber gloves and goggles, is a sadist, and experiments on people. How original! He works at an old prison/lab in a brick fortress called ""Raven-something or other"". So subtle! There is a scene where young Harry Oz gets deposed by security guards and kicked out of ownership of the company. No lawyers involved in the changing of leadership for the worlds most advanced company. Realistic!  In the opening scene, Spidey takes his time wise-cracking and cutting up while a giant semi truck plows through cars. Very heroic! They probably spent more on port-a-potties to make this movie than they did on the script, which must have been written by someone who's lived in a cave all their lives and has never actually interacted with another human being - or the writer for Gilmore Girls, which is pretty much the same thing. Seeing this movie is as if the executives walked around town, asked people if they liked spiderman, and when someone said ""Yes"" they hit them over the head with a club and went through their pockets.

6128934,5,B00H2FPY20,"This movie is heavily story-driven and the each of the main characters play their roles tremendously. Three villains in the previews threw me off but this movie really did a great job introducing each of them. Their hatred for Spider-Man shows a gradual build and you will love it because it will thrill you. Gwen and Peter have such remarkable chemistry that the love-story in this movie will make you AND your girlfriend enjoy it's gooshiness. The actor choice of Electro could have been better but nonetheless, Jamie Foxx did a pretty good job playing the role. You get to see how he was before becoming an electrical menace and you understand why he becomes the way he is. Harry Osbourne is finally introduced in this series and the actor who plays him seems a bit young but also plays the role of a young, arrogant rich boy very well. Overall, this film triggers your emotions and shows you that in the end, there is something always worth fighting for.

Also, many people compare the Amazing Spider-Man series to the Spider-Man movies that Toby McGuire starred as Peter Parker. Don't use that as a basis of judgement for any of these movies and you will learn that the Amazing-Spiderman series is phenomenal and does a swell job sticking to the comics' structure.",1409097600,,1269,4.716216216216216

Andrew Garfield is normally so fantastic, but this wasn't his time to shine.  As talented as Emma Stone is, she seemed to be ""phoning it in.""  And the frenemy formerly played by young James Franco was simply creepy & difficult to watch.  The ambiguous ending left us hanging; normally, we'd be longing for another sequel, but I feel this franchise should be laid to rest.  I imagine our high school & college students would enjoy it, but it's too intense & dark for under-12.

After viewing the movie trailer months before it's release, I was so umimpressed that I dumped this movie from my ""must-see"" list for 2014.  Good thing I did, because the movie was just as disappointing as I'd expected.  It was one big action movie ""cliche"" that relied so heavily on CGI and special effects that the plot and the solid cast failed to establish any real depth.  It's hard to believe that after delivering an outstanding film like Captain America: The Winter Soldier (a must-see!) Marvel would deliver such a sub-par movie like Amazing Spiderman 2 a short time later.  This movie is a rental at best.  Don't even drop 20 bucks on the DVD.",1409011200,,781,4.535714285714286

If they were trying to go away from the old Spider-man mythos, there was no need for this to happen.  Also, what was the reasoning behind telling the audience that the spiders were specially coded to work on the Parker bloodline only to have Osborne successfully use it?  Why intentionally mistreat the Electro character to try an garner sympathy?  That was out-and-out bullying of a low functioning individual.  SIck.  There were so many 'wasted' avenues of creations in this film.  The special effects were good, I'll give you that, but the movie needed a cohesive, well written story.  If someone gets punched in the face, flesh out the reasons 'why' it had to happen.  The makers of the film should not rely on just special effects to cover up overly simplistic, predictable plots and characters with the hope that the audience will accept it.

Please do not waste your time with this movie, unless you are in a zombie apocalypse and you want to distract your kids from the horror happening outside your window.

Also hoping the next Apple TV supports 3D so I can have my entire HD video library be digital.

The movie itself sheds some light on his parents and the past. It has him making tough decisions and learning he can't control others or their own fate. The special effects are awesome. Several villains as well make appearances and spidey has a smart mouth as well. Great movie all in all.

Bringing Spidey from the comics to the big screen, is always a huge leap at best, but they did it with a quality you rarely see. However, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have taken the franchise to another level. With the first cast, it was very fine actors, telling a story about an average teenager blessed with extraordinary powers. With the second crew, the acting is so sublime, I actually believe there is a young man in New York who was bitten by a radioactive spider! Not to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, in this movie, Spidey sees the effects of his powers come full circle in that he realizes there are huge sacrifices that he did not foresee with this super-human ability.

6129079,5,B00H2FPY20,I am already enjoying this movie a lot better than the original series with  Tobey Maguire as Spiderman.

6129080,5,B00H2FPY20,"As much as I loved the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies (especially the first two), I have to say that Marc Webb's entries thus far are even better. I can point to a number of reasons for this: the action scenes have more weight, the stories dig a bit deeper, and - standing out in particular - the acting is extraordinary. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 could have easily slipped up and become overcrowded with villains and bombastic action sequences. But everything stays contained throughout, balanced, and anchored by two outstanding actors, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, especially Stone, who is pitch perfect in this role.

I'm keeping this review very short, because I mostly want to point out that the fate of Gwen Stacey is no secret. It's part of Spider-Man's history, arguably the most important part. The way it is weaved into this film is nothing short of astonishing. When dealing with such important scenes, everything has to come together just right, and I really think it did in this movie. I could quibble with a few bits here and there for this movie, but so many things go right, especially in the key scenes, that it's almost hard to remember what I might have done differently.

This product itself is packaged well, and I love having both the Blu-ray and DVD discs. It's my favorite way to own movies these days, and I'm satisfied in what they've delivered. First and foremost, though, it's about the movie, and we've now got a pair of Marc Webb films that I am sure will stand the test of time.",1408838400,,1509,4.647940074906367
6129081,1,B00H2FPY20,"This movie was so horrible that Emma Stone withdrew from the franchise.  The plot makes no sense, the super-villain battles are confusing, and the writing/directing was atrocious.  So let's get to it.  Peter Parker is bored, so Spiderman flies through the buildings of New York until Oscorp - the most evil and vile company every conceived decides to ship unimaginably huge amounts of explosive plutonium through the middle of the city with insufficient security so that it can be stolen by some machine gun wielding Eastern European thugs.  By the way, instead of being bored, he was supposed to be at his graduation ceremony listening to the Valedictorian speech delivered by his one true love.  Back to the action  instead of stopping the rampaging truck crashing through city streets and destroying cars and threatening citizens, he simply rescues those in its path or allows it to collide with bus full of people so he can save the bus.  I know it's a fantasy requiring a suspension of belief, but exchanging witty repartee while the driver continues barreling down the street seems very snit-super-hero.  This movie spends 75% of its time being confusing and saves all the action scenes for the last 30 minutes.  Please don't reward the makers of this crap by attending their movies or buying any releases of this film on media.",1408838400,3,1334,4.919642857142857
6129082,4,B00H2FPY20,"Amazing Spider-man 2 is the second chapter of the reboot that brings back Andrew Garfield (Parker) and Emma Stone (as Gwen) where Peter deals with personal problems while at the same time dealing with bad guys including Rhino, Electro and the Green Goblin.

Although I have still not decided whether I prefer this reboot of Spider man or the original series with Tobey Maguire as both have their pluses and minuses in terms of story and action.  This sequel to the reboot does well with the action sequences and special effects and even though this movie clocks in at over 2 hours and 20 minutes, I felt as though we were short changed with the 3 villians in the movie, especially Rhino and the Green Goblin.  Maybe because you are trying to fit 3 major Spidey villians into one movie or maybe it is a setup for the sequel where they will get more screen play, I don't know for sure but I do know that I wanted more action sequences with them.

This film follows the trend of late of humanizing the superhero (like the Superman and Batman reboots) although less dark and brooding than those two. It is not necessarily a bad thing and the quick witted comments throughout the movie by Spidey during the action sequences brings me back to my Spiderman comic days which I did enjoy.

My biggest issue with the movie really was that I thought that the romance sequences between Peter and Gwen was just too much and took up too much of the movie.  I don't mind the story between the two as it is part of the Spiderman story but this could have been cut down a bit and opened up more time for other parts of the story which seemed to have been cut a bit in places.

Overall a decent sequel but could have been a bit more action and a bit less romance.",1408838400,,1745,4.350769230769231
6129083,3,B00H2FPY20,"This quote from Seinfeld sums up this movie nicely.  They should call this Spiderman 90210 because half the movie is spent on teen angst between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy.

Since Amazing Spiderman 2 was a rental I decided to give it a try, despite the not-so-great reviews.  I thought it was pretty good. Better than the first Thor movie, better than any of the Hulk Movies, much better than the last Superman movie.  I thought the Jamie Fox villain, Electro, was cool. Liked his powers, his look, and raspy voice. The guy who played Spidey (Andrew something) seems to be a good actor. In some of his quiet scenes he had some real intensity and conveyed strong emotions. His wisecracks seemed funny and appropriate for his age/situation. The Emma Stone character, to me, was surprisingly weak. I just didn't care about her.  Sally Field felt weird as Aunt Mae, to recognizable for a part that did not require someone of her skill.

Overall, I love the fact that I can watch this movie with my kids and it not be bogged down with some subliminal political agenda, which seems to be prevalent in so many movies created in this day and age . At the heart of this is a beautiful love story, which even when there is tragedy, you still feel the need for hope and a positive outlook on life. This movie had several cool action scenes and I personally love the soundtrack. There are a lot of little clues and just some really cool things in general that any Spidey fan will appreciate. You probably won't catch them all the first time through. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is beautiful. You can tell that these two genuinely care for each other The interaction that Spider-Man has with the average common citizen is really cool as well. He is not just trying to save these people, but he also tries to take the time to get to know them. I can't wait for the next installment to come out.",1408838400,2,1183,4.333333333333333

It may not be the comic book exactly, but should it be?  I don't think so. Only 1 villain is dominate throughout this film. The other two don't come until the end and are clearly there to add a twist and to set up another movie. There is absolutely no comparison to Sam Raimi's disastrous franchise ending film. The film's music is also amazing but that is a different review. Watch this movie. You won't be sorry!  My only negative comment is that the creation of the films main villain seemed a bit campy like a bad batman movie, but that is my only complaint. This is probably the best Spider-Man movie out there.",1408838400,2,953,4.459770114942529

6129111,4,B00H2FPY20,"As a longtime Spidey fan I have to say that I liked this one, ikn some ways more than the first, but it does have some issues.  Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have both grown into their parts more than the last one and I'd have to say that I liked their acting better this time around.  I don't mind the weay the writers re-wrote Electro and Jamie Foxx was a good choice to play him but as the main supervillain the part was very shallow as he goes from being an admirer of Spidey to being a hater without much transition.  Midway through the movie the writers doubled-back and put the main focus on Harry Osborne and his developing hatred of Spiderman.  And to top it off we have the first-ever movie portrayal of The Rhino (Paul Giamatti) as a stooge of OsCorp, with the suggestion that other Spidey-foes are to come out of the OsCorp labs.  Good movie but they're rewriting too much of the origin stories.",1408838400,,908,4.349112426035503

I don't think the script writers really understood the importance of world-building, or if they felt as though their predecessors have already done the job for them. PARENT WARNING/Spoiler Alert: any parents thinking to watch this with their kids should be aware that there is a very grisly death scene that might be too much for young or sensitive children.

I give the film 3 stars. I am deducting 2 stars for the inclusion of the deservedly maligned Ultraviolet Digital Restrictions Management Copy.

Visuals - The movie looks great.  Spidey's costume is rock solid and Electro looks pretty sinister.  Weak points are rhino and goblin.

Story - The action and mystery plot are both weak and full of holes.  The whole thing focuses a lot more on the relationship between Spidey and Gwen.  Overall the relationship is handle fairly well, but Gwen gets a little annoying towards the end.  Because of the relationship aspect don't expect to see much of the villains.  Doesn't really seem like this movie knew what it wanted to be.

Comedy - The jokes are very been there, done that.  Rapid fire wise-cracks that either don't resonate or just aren't funny cause we've heard them before.

Music - The music choices are horrible, so distracting and cheesy.  The first song when Spidey appears is some kind of throwback patriotic theme.

They turned the Rhino into, what is a polymer infused person in the comics, a regular guy wearing a tank suit. For that reason, it will probably ruin the next film if Rhino appears in it as the mech suit really doesn't follow the comics at ALL and I'm surprised Stan Lee would even consider this abomination.

Apart from that I really enjoyed the movie. I can deal with slight mix ups from the comics to spice things up, but to completely alter the very foundation of something goes a bit too far, in my opinion.",1408752000,,598,4.339285714285714

I mean enough is enough, and then to find out in the end that he's still alive and planning more mischief. BORING. Does every freaking Marvel movie that comes out now have to look like a two hour video game? I enjoyed the first entry into this new resurrection of the beloved Marvel character.

6129152,5,B00H2FPY20,"How would I describe Amazing Spider-Man 2? A slow paced movie with a very dramatic and heartfelt ending.  Before you read this review, let me warn you about a major Spoiler Alert!

If you read any of the comics during the 1970's , you'd know that Gwen Stacy dies at the hands of the Green Goblin.  Did the audience know the details behind the mythology of ol' web head?

Is that why it failed at the box office?  Fox, the studio that produces the Spidey films, has put the third movie on hold.  How a film maker presents a subject matter, such as the death of a beloved character, is a matter of pacing.  That was the problem with this film.

 A quick recap of the first movie tells us Peter Parker's father worked with genetically engineered Spiders for OsCorp.  That's Norman Osborn's corporation.  Comic fans know that Norman was the original Green Goblin. The movie gives us a flash back and shows us his parents were killed because of the father's research.  If you can suspend your belief in logic and reality, you might enjoy this movie.

The characters have been updated to appeal to a modern audience.  However it appears the director has contempt for the target audience. Electro turns out to be an obsessed fan of Spider-Man, whose ideas for a new power source were stolen by OsCorp.

The Green Goblin was Norman's Osborne's son. He felt cheated out of a normal child hood by his money hungry corporate C.E.O. father.  They were written as cookie cutter characters with no other motivation than to advance the plot.

There's a bright spot to this movie. The final battle between Goblin and Spidey was nothing short of spectacular.  It's what I paid to see since  the beginning of the film.  The tragic demise of Gwen was followed by her funeral.  It strengthened Peter's resolve to continue fighting crime.

We got to see the ghost of Gwen's father. Silently portrayed by Dennis Leary.  He appeared in a series of camera shots where Peter sees him in his mind's eye.

Sally Field expertly played Aunt May. She wasn't the frail, heart attack waiting to happen of the comics.  Her character was training to be a nurse's aide.  To bring more money in the Parker household.

J. Jonah Jameson was mentioned in a conversation between Peter and Aunt May in a brief scene.  Apparently he rejected Peter's photos for publication.  Surprisingly, we never see the Daily Bugle or any of his co-workers at that great metropolitan newspaper.

What's my final verdict for this DVD?  The aptly named director, Mark Webb, has to return to film school.  If it wasn't for the fantastic special effects at the conclusion, it would have been a wash out.  There were bits of comedy.  Paul Giamatti chews the scenery in his role as former Russian mobster.  He turns out to be the Rhino. His character has more personality than any of the other villains.  Too bad he didn't get more screen time.

I don't feel like I wasted my $15 dollars on this DVD.  There's a director's commentary and a music video. Let's not forget the vudu.com digital copy.  When I purchase that I-Phone or table let there will be a small stash of Marvel movies to watch.",1408752000,2,3132,4.61524500907441

Have Rhino be the first, more minor villain, but Goblin the main guy. We're barely able to care about the strain on Peter and Harry's relationship because Electro takes away so much time from that. The ending would have been all the more powerful if that had been allowed to build more slowly and naturally throughout, rather than having Electro be the main focus for most of the film.

The Amazing Spider-Man reboot has sought to explore a lot of the back story of Peter Parker which leads to the origin of Spider-Man which is a good idea, because most persons don't know except through the comics.

Spoiler free: The visuals, and fight scenes in the movie really show of spider-mans beautiful acrobatic moves, and flexibility, also of course the art of his webs. Story wise it's a hit and miss with several key plot points, and characters being run over by a rhino.

Spoiler Warning: As stated before the movie looks gorgeous, the city, the CG, everything, also the romance between Peter and Gwen is believable and enjoyable. The movie seeks to explore several key plots in the spidey universe including:
The Parker's (The past of Peter's parents, what they did, and why they left him.)
The Goblin Family (The relationship between Harry, his father, and how the Goblin curse runs through their veins)
The broken web (When Gwen dies, Peter is left in turmoil wonder whether it was the impact of the fall, or the force of his web that killed her.)
A web that connects (After Gwens death the pathway is open for Mary Jane to heal a broken Peter Parker/Spider-Man)
It was amazing to see the movie take on these various plots but unfortunately it seemed like they bit off too much, and choked. A lot of these points were only touched on the surface, and never done any true justice, I understand a bit why they would put a hold on the franchise, but i would still give them another chance",1408752000,2,1616,4.607638888888889

Sure the Rhino and the Green Goblin could have been in it more, but that's what the sequels are for.

Yeah, he's in the movie for all of 7 minutes maximum, and there is never a fight between him and Spider Man.  Electro is a joke, an insecure nerd who upon gaining superpowers goes from wanting to be a superhero like Spider-Man to murdering innocent people en masse, because...reasons?  Oh, and I hope you like dub step, because there is a gimmick where Electro creates his own godawful soundtrack by electrifying things.  The plot is nonsensical, it's practically like Uncle Ben never existed in the first place, and I would be hard-pressed to tell you exactly what happened except one long set-up for the next pile of crap they push out.

6129186,4,B00H2FPY20,"I know what you may be thinking: A ridiculous product for a ridiculous film.

But, for those of us that *greatly* enjoyed the sequel, this limited-run set is actually interesting for a crucial reason: it places the villain and the actor who portrayed him directly in the spotlight outright, which runs counter to other versions of the home media release specifically and the genre generally. From a marketing perspective, this item may have very well been an exercise in contractual merchandising on Jamie Foxx's part, but that doesn't mean this can't be enjoyed and appreciated, especially at a discounted price [see second paragraph]. The likeness is spot-on, though due to the nature of the plastic sculpt (produced via rotocasting, so the head will lack seams and be hollow enough for the LED feature) the details are softer than one would hope. Still, that becomes a moot point when you click the button on the back and see how good the color-accurate, randomized LED display is -- the bust genuinely looks like it has electricity surging throughout the cranium, and that's the point. It does what one would expect it to, and does it well.

At an original $150, it *is* extremely difficult to justify, but as of this writing the cost is a heavily discounted $75, which (given the cost of the engineering, plastic production, LEDs, and overall manufacturing) is what it should have cost outright -- expect further discounts in the near future. The rotocast production and light-up feature indeed make for a more unique Superhero genre home media collectible, and might even be SONY's answer to Marvel Studios' ""Avengers"" Phase One briefcase. The 3-D Blu-Ray, standard Blu-Ray with supplements, and DVD discs have their own smaller, compact case that protects them well enough, located in its own holding tray in the base of the bust. It features nice spider/electric graphic decals, the sort of thing collectors may have come to expect from a set like this. That does give you the option to keep the discs separate from the bust if you so choose.

Yes, a bust of the featured villain from a superhero film seems like a poor choice for a moderately expensive limited edition movie case. And yes, making it Electro - so it can feature a light-up gimmick - may have been a sneaky way for the studio to justify charging a high price for it, insuring a purchase and minor profit bump from the so-called nerds and geeks who eat these sort of collectibles up wholesale (*raises hand*). Even so, there's no denying that's all hidden relatively well in the sheer originality of the product.

6129193,4,B00H2FPY20,"I was very impressed with 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man. It took one of my favorite film franchises, Raimi's Spider-Man, and made it more complex, more character-driven, and just overall cooler. But just because I liked the first one better, doesn't mean that the second would continue it's greatness. It turns out, however, that The Amazing Spider-Man 2, though not quite as good as the first, is another excellent addition to the Spider-Man franchise.

The plot is rather complex, but I'll try to summarize it the best I can. Simply put, Peter is having internal conflicts about the promise he broke at the end of the first film. He struggles with this while trying to discover more about his parents' deaths. Meanwhile, a nobody named Max Dillon is unexpectedly transformed into Electro, a villain who can create and control electricity. In another place, Harry Osborn (Peter's old friend) has discovered that he has a rare disease passed down by his family.

Though there are probably more plots than there need to be, the movie handles them quite well. I like how we learn more about what happened with Peter's parents, and I also like the conflicts about Peter's irresponsible choice in the first film's end. This film also sets up for the third film nicely and keeps me interested in what's going to happen.

Many people, including myself, were worried that three villains (Electro, Green Goblin, and Rhino) were too many. From what the advertisements made it look like, it appeared that we were going to get another Spider-Man 3. However, the villains in this film were worked out much better. Rhino, for example, doesn't appear until the end and helps make the ending better. The other two are used for pure story purposes and are handled nicely. Though not as good as Willem Defoe, the new Goblin is especially cool and is a good replacement. Electro is also a really cool villain, and his pathetic alter ego is sometimes entertaining to watch.

Despite their being many different plots to this movie, the movie still manages to keep the heart of the other Spider-Man films. There's still plenty of time to see the characters grow and interact, and the film carries a central theme: that you have to spend the little time you have with your loved ones the best way you can. This theme helps make the movie much more meaningful than a lot of other movies Hollywood is offering today. This movie also manages to reaffirm why the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man is my favorite iteration of the webhead. In this film, he's much funnier than the first film (even though he was really funny in the that one) and just overall more interesting than Tobey Maguire. Though I won't spoil the ending, I would also like to point out that the ending was possibly the most emotional ending in any of the Spider-Man films. The only thing I don't like about the structure of the film is that it's a little long.

Though it doesn't flow quite as well as the first one, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a great addition to the franchise and my personal second favorite. The characters are entertaining, the action sequences are spectacular, and the story (though a little tangled) is very interesting. I could at least say that this is the coolest and funniest Spider-Man film to date. If you liked the first one, you'll probably enjoy this one too.

The performances are fantastic; the chemistry between Garfield and Stone provides one of the best love stories ever in a comic book movie.

The Green Goblin (Spider-Man's greatest foe) feels thrown in at random and there is no reason for him to act Gobliny besides that the script demands it.

In the beginning Spidey set a new standard in comic book characters by being a hero that had to deal with the flaws and young love angst of being a teenager and a super hero.  That was 50 years ago and since then the formula has been adopted and adapted by any number of young adult novels such as Hunger Games or Defiant to the point that it's becoming a yawn-fest for anyone over the age or 21 or so.  While Marvel's other characters such as Iron Man or Captain America have backstories that allow them to deal with more real-world adult themes and bad guys that exist in a world of government corruption and/or terrorism which makes them more interesting to more sophisticated and demanding audiences, I'm afraid the legend of Spiderman just doesn't match up well in a world that's become far more dangerous than this episode's ""electrifying"" bad guy with a grudge against Spiderman.",1408579200,,1061,4.786885245901639

Anyway, a lot of the Spider-Man action is great, but it's very little.  I understand that a lot of the greatest Spider-Man comic book stories explored Peter and his background, and focused on things outside of the Spider-Man action, but you need to actually have good writers in movies to make that work.  The movie just fell flat and makes you want to see more Spidey, but all you get is filler.  Who writes this stuff?

Andrew Garfield, continues in my mind to be the best Spiderman/Peter Parker...just slightly beating out Tobey McGuire. The on-again/off-again romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey is developed nicely in this film; and when on-again, the chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone lights up the screen...Stone outshines Kirsten Dunst (who plays Spidey's love interest in the first franchise) by far. Of course there is an ominous development late in the film which will no doubt affect Peter/Spidey's romantic endeavors. Aside from Garfield and Stone, look for fine performances from Jamie Fox (Electro) and Paul Giamatti (Rhino) in the villain department; and another fine performance from Sally Field as Peter's aunt and surrogate mom. Dane DeHaan and Colm Feore also do well as OsCorp Industries employees who take a villainous turn later in the movie. While both the first and second efforts in this new franchise are fine Marvel comic book actioners, the first one has a slight edge and is the better film...my opinion of course.

6129220,1,B00H2FPY20,"The Spider-Man suit in Amazing Spider-Man 2 is excellent.  It's perfect.  And for the first 3 minutes of the film you think things might be okay from there because of that fact, but nope, no, no.  My goodness, no.

No not long into the movie you're treated to an egregiously annoying Paul Giamatti, which is certainly a low point in his career, I'm sure.  Oh sure, we get a couple good jokes thanks to Garfield's Spider-Man, but the over-the-top babbling that Giamatti spouts completely takes you out of the enjoyment of it all.  It doesn't improve when he actually returns later in the film as an ABSOLUTELY abysmal rendition of the Rhino, for all of like, three minutes?  It was pathetic.  More unintelligible babbling, a stupid dumpy looking robot, with some of the worst CGI (enjoy Giamatti's floating head there) in the movie.

You've already seen the end of this film by the way.  Literally.  If you've seen any of the trailers building up the movie in theaters, you were shown the last second of the film.  Spidey whirls a manhole cover at the dumpy Rhino bot and then black.  Awful.  Just awful.

So what about the rest of the movie you ask?  It's a mess.  Between Peter and Gwen breaking up, un-breaking up, ghost Dennis Leary being stupid, the whole movie exists to, rather painfully, shove in Gwen's uh...""future"" shall we say.  Which you also already know if you know anything about Spider-Man.  You gain nothing out of it when it happens, and you really don't care (and you might be laughing your butt off at the ridiculous ""web hand"" too!).  The movie exists to do that plot point and then set up for the future movies.  By doing that, it completely ignores the current movie!  Yes, why worry about making what you have a good film, just let the audience know that more are coming, you can spend your hard earned cash on future installments! The villains?  Well I already talked about Giamatti, howabout Electro?  Pointless!  He's there for a battle in Time Square (because he hates Spider-Man now all of a sudden), and then a really lame final fight (where Gwen hits him with a car at one point.  Huh?), you could easily remove the character from the film and not miss a thing.  In fact it may have helped other parts of the film out because of it.  He's only there so the posters could have ""Jamie Foxx"" for star power.  Don't be fooled, the character is a crazy mess of writing and plot convenience.  He has no real motivation other than ""I hate everyone now"" and...wanting the power grid.  I guess.

Harry Osborn, is actually well acted and I found myself rather liking what they were doing with him in this film.  At first, anyway.  The fact remains that Amazing Spider-Man, in it's attempt to NOT be the Raimi movies in any way, shot itself in the foot.  You never had any character build up for anyone, you have these missing characters like Harry that you don't get to see interact with Peter, or even be mentioned, so that in this movie you don't care that Parker and Osborne are friends in this movie.  Once again, it's a plot convenience.  The movie goes ""Here's Harry, he's dying, Spider-Man won't give his blood, now he hates everyone, woops, Green Goblin now.""  This is another reason why Electro should have been excised from the film, to give Harry some more development, and maybe, just maybe, allow Peter and Harry to be something interesting on screen.

So by the end of the movie, you'll probably be left wondering ""what was the point of that?""  To sell you more movies, my dear, nothing more, nothing less.  I personally thought this film was better than the first film (frankly this movie is so jarringly different in tone that it makes you wonder why ASM1 exists at all), but it's still bottom of the barrel film-making.  I can only hope that Marc Webb will no longer be attached to future Spider-Man films, because it's pretty clear that he doesn't know what he's going for with these flicks.

As an aside to the whole Sinister Six movie that may (hopefully not) happen; that's probably the worst thing about this mess of a film.  All these villains will find their origins through Oscorp, which has a storage facility of all the gizmos and gimmicks of the Six so far, and that's as lazy as it could get.  You lose the individuality of these villains, Doc Ock, Vulture, Rhino, they no longer have backstories elsewhere, no, they're mass produced goons, pawns in a game given their tech right off the bat.  No accidents, no history, just ready to go villains so future films don't have to ""waste time"" on that.  And I hate that more than anything.  I can't help but wonder if Sony has picked up on the irony of a big corporation creating soulless vessels to venture forth on their behalf.

Don't bother with this movie.  Rent it maybe, but don't expect anything long-standing.  You'll forget this thing exists in a month.",1408492800,9,4858,4.590697674418605
6129221,5,B00H2FPY20,"This movie was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed exploring the life of Peter Parker and how being Spiderman effects his life.  Andrew Garfield was a great choice in actor.

While the movie did not have a lot of action the times when Spiderman was fighting was fast and exciting.  Dane DeHaan was amazing as the Harry Osborn.  It was the right kind of sinister for this movie.

I would recommend renting this movie opposed from buying it.  The movie is fun and exciting the first time watching, but not a lot of re-watch value.",1408492800,5,517,4.378947368421053

6129223,2,B00H2FPY20,"PLEASE SONY and/or MARC WEBB, I am begging you to  STOP RUINING THIS FRANCHISE!  The first Amazing Spider-Man was not great but I hoped that 2 would be better and make me retroactively appreciate the first one.  Sadly, that did not happen.  So disappointing to watch a great superhero character go down the toilet.

I had heard the poor reviews while 2 was in theaters and decided I would wait for it to come to video.  For me not to see a superhero movie in the theaters is almost unnatural.  That alone should say something to the studios, when a diehard comic fanboy is unwilling to pay the price of admission.  I'm supposed to be the built-in audience.

I guess I have to give a few reasons why The Amazing Spider-Man 2 sucks but I don't wish to create review of the film so I'll be brief.

So what's wrong with Marc Webb's Spider-Man?

First, I will say that the cast are all wonderful actors but they really miss the mark in this film.  We can blame a bad script and director for that.  I do have to compare Marc Webb's Spider-Man to the predecessor's franchise (Sam Raimi) which I liked very much until the 3rd film.

Raimi's characters were wholesome and the story was about morality.  Parker (Tobey Maquire) was subdued and shy.  He was an underdog and a bit of an outcast.  Spider-Man was not only an opportunity for him to do good but it was an opportunity for Parker to be accepted.  I related to this Peter Parker.  I felt for him through his triumphs and follies.

Andrew Garfiled's Peter Parker is irreverent and sarcastic.  He has the beautiful girl, knows what to say, stands up for his friends.  He's too cool and hip.  He doesn't need the alter ego to be accepted or to fight for a cause.  Additionally, Garfield's Spider-Man doesn't take crime fighting seriously.  He is conceited with regard to his powers.  Sarcastic (when masked) is one thing we expect but he misses the mark entirely.  The struggle is lost in this new Spider-Man story on many levels.

As for the story, I prefer a superhero story that starts within a believable universe rather than having someone get special powers then fight other people that also just got special powers....especially when the villains are CG monsters.  It takes away from the awe of a man with super powers when you start adding all these other super characters.  You know what they say...when everyone is special, no one is special.

There are too many flaws in the script to get into details so I'm going to leave that one alone.

The musical score really misses the mark.  The anthem they play seems to suggest this spectacularly cool event when you see Spidey swinging through the city.  They expect us to be wowed by just Spidey swinging but there's no connection to what's on screen so the music seems oddly unfitting.

There is no setup for Paul Giamatti's character.  Why hire someone as great as Paul and give him a role that any talentless hack could perform?  We have no understanding of his character and they never give us any reason to fear, hate or care for him.

Denis Leary...how many times do we need to see him stare in disappointment.  A little heavy handed?  I think so.

Anyway, I've spent more time than I should reviewing this film.  I need to forget about it and move on.  I can only hope that someone in charge of this film hears my cry.  I'm waiting to start spending money on Spider-Man again but clearly it is not going to happen with Marc Webb at the helm.",1408492800,13,3450,4.5040387722132476
6129224,2,B00H2FPY20,"I have been trying to watch this movie for 3 weeks now and I am still not quite finished.

I hate to say it, but this movie is really bad.  Peter Parker is somehow a cool, confident teenager.  The villains are one dimensional and utterly laughable.  And almost everything that happens in between the action scenes seems utterly unnecessary and pointless.

I also think the actor who played Harry/Green Goblin did a great job although I would have like more camera time for the green goblin but ok. I DO NOT like the fact that there were 3 DIFFERENT VILLAINS in 1 movie. It was completely unnecessary and each villian did not get the attention they deserved. I absolutely HATED Jamie Foxx's performance in this movie! And before anyone can yell out ""Racist"" I am black and I just didn't like his performance.

From the web swinging through the city to the way Spider-Man dodges the villains attacks makes you feel like the action came from one of his comics. Garfield, Stone, and Fields all do their characters justice in bringing the depth and emotion this movie needed. The villains are not ""too many"" like some have said and are wonderfully done as well.  We don't need a full two hour back story for each villain to be effective in the movie. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and it's predecessor are above and beyond way better and truer to my favorite comic-book character growing up than Raimi's three versions.  No movie will ever be able to follow the comics 100% but that doesn't mean it isn't a badass movie.  If you liked the previous Spider-man movies more than the Amazing Spider-Man then you might not like this, but if you're like me and were blown away by the reboot than the Amazing Spider-Man 2 won't disappoint!",1408492800,,1012,4.636871508379889
6129227,2,B00H2FPY20,"I don't even know where to start here in my review. I am so upset that Sony did not learn from their mistakes from Spider-Man 3 one bit. This movie suffers from the same type of underdeveloped characters as their 2007 movie. Green Goblin feels so shoehorned into this movie just like Venom was in Spider-Man 3. Green Goblin is one of the most iconic and beloved Spider-Man villains of all-time and they give him only a few minutes of screen time. On top of this Green Goblin looks absolutely awful here. Sony has never been able to make a good looking Green Goblin. I think it was even worse looking than Harry's flying snowboard looking Goblin from Spider-Man 3, but its hard to tell because they are both awful. The same could be said with Rhino, poorly developed and a suit unfaithful to the comics.

I believe 2 villains is okay for a superhero movie if they are both developed correctly but yet again Sony assumed they could have 3 and failed miserably.",1408492800,,958,4.505747126436781

6129244,5,B00H2FPY20,"To start, I believe that the majority of detractors toward like ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", are struck dumb and speechless when presented with an intelligent, emotional and altogether gut wrenching piece of celluloid.  I understand that a lot of people love their summer blockbusters, but I expect the those who do, enjoy mindless popcorn flicks devoid of any genuine human drama and intricacy.  If you're a film goer who loathes intelligent plots, next-level acting skills, and heart rending finality, then this is not the movie for you.  a tip of my hat and a bow of respect to Andrew Garfield, who takes the character of Peter Parker much, much farther than Toby Maguire ever dreamed of going.  Without Garfield, I truly believe that the movie would have fallen flat on an emotional level.  Without giving anything away, it's how handles Peter Parker's journey at the end of the film that floors you.  Also, huge kudos to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro.  He gives us a villain with genuine pathos, coaxing sympathy from the audience when most other actors would have dusted Dillon off as an annoying, bratty nerd.  As much as Garfield and Foxx's performances blew me away, it's Dane Dehann who steals the film as Harry Osborn.  He brings a Harry who is arrogant, preening, and wholeheartedly embraceable and sympathetic as the heir not only of his father's fortune and company, but also of a deadly genetic disease.  It's not only Peter's relationship with Gwen Stacy, the love of his life, but also his relationship with Harry, that injects an unnerving, and completely heartbreaking, emotional core into the heart of ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"".  This is by far, the most satisfying Spider-Man movie yet.

Peter (Garfield) is realizing that keeping his promise of staying away from Gwen (Stone) harder then he expected. Saving the city is still easy for him though. After Norman, the head of Oscorp dies and his son Harry is forced out villain after villain is created and Spider-man faces threats both physically and emotionally. I have to begin be saying that I have never been a big Spider-man fan. When it comes to comic book movies I like the darker ones like Batman and the newest X-Men series. To me Spider-man has always been a little too angsty and cheesy for me. This movie did nothing to change my view. This movie dealt more with the relationship between Gwen and Peter then Spider-man vs. bad guys. For some people that may be OK but I am also not a fan of teenage love- dramas. Jamie Foxx was good in this as usual but he also seemed wasted, like they just wanted a big name actor for a bad guy and he was put into a role beneath his talent. My biggest complaint was the main reason I wanted to see this was for Paul Giamatti. He is one of the best and most underrated actors around today. Not to spoil anything but he is in the movie for about 3 minutes total. Car chase in the beginning and a scene at the end that served no other purpose then to set up a third movie. All that said though I again am not a Spider-man fan. If you like him you will like this movie, if you don't then like me you probably won't. Overall, a cheesy comic book movie that was basically Gwen and Peter break up, Spider-man scene, they get back together, Spider-man scene, they break up, Spider-man scene...over and over. To me this was just long and hard to care about. I do think that fans will love this though. I give this a C+.",1408233600,,1850,4.273504273504273
6129273,2,B00H2FPY20,"my impressions of this movie after seeing it at the theater: disappointment and let down. i've LOVED spider-man for over 35 yrs and just can't recommend this movie. it was long and drawn out with hardly any action. i don't mind a good story but how can you have a spider-man movie with barely any action?! they made the electro character very different than the comic book (why??), which always ticks off us comic book fans. they never have enough villains- we see the rhino for a blink of an eye. at least the next movie looks more promising with the 'sinister six'. i just don't get how they can screw up a spider-man movie...but they did with this one. seriously, sony, get it together!! a spider-man movie should be fool proof!",1408233600,,731,4.545454545454546

6129278,3,B00H2FPY20,"if you don't know anything about spider-man, you might love this movie..if you do know the history of spider-man then viewing it from a movie point of view directors doing whatever they want with no consideration for what actually happened in the comics it might be ok.

First off, Electro is the Red Skull's son, meaning he is a white german man with a german acsent, Red Skull created him, watcht he spider-man cartoon season 5 from the 90's they show the whole deal and it was awesome. In this movie, electro is black, crazy for spider-man and yet out of nowhere decide's he wants to kill spider-man which made no sense at all, how you look up to someone for saving you, they literaly only knock you out cause you attacking cops with electricity when you get shot..makes no sense...
..
Harry, don't get me started on Harry, he looks like Toby (the other spider-man actor from the first movies) in spider-man 3 when he had the black venom and gothic kind of look, why have harry look like that? what reason? it's so stupid, then his Father Norman Osborn actually dies, doesn't become the green goblin at all which is bull. Then harry becomes green goblin and kills gwen stacy but still he looked nothing like the green goblin, the cheapest green goblin outfit I ever seen in my life, some metal things for ears and around his face making no sense at all, the costume was so bad I cant even remember how it looks.

at least they did the death of gwen stacy which is the only reason this movie is getting 3 stars, otherwise 0.. she died in the comic a similar way, the only consideration these arrogant directors or whatever had for spider-man a comic book most likely older then they are..

it was stupid to have gwen stacy in the first movie before he got his powers ect... do mary jane then gwen stacy, whyc ant these idiots just make the movie the right way, the first spiderman with toby was beautiful, it actually related to the comic, here it's like do whatever you want and people will pay to see it cause the name spiderman is on it...

not to mention Rhino at the end, how stupid, rhino doesn't have a freaking suit like that, he has a rhino costume and is a huge man who could crush spider-man, they could have hired a wrestler like ""The Big Show"" for that.",1408233600,5,2268,4.405727923627685

This movie brought a level of sophistication to spider-man a true classic to light. By binding together a very well thought out plot true to the actual story, I truly believe this to be cinematic genius. Someone who is ignorant of the actual story in its entirety would rate this less than a five. The highlight of the movie for me was the down play of the well known villain rhino. It is an already well explored character on the cartoon, but this is not meant to be for children I would think. It is meant for a new breed of onlooker. For the new generation of dreamers. For those who choose to use there imagination, I believe this was a fantastic twist to a movie that was already faltered once before.

6129289,4,B00H2FPY20,"So, I have a confession to make. I actually boycotted The Amazing Spider-Man 2 when it came into theatres. I boycotted it because Sony treated me like an idiot. Turning their marketing machine into frantic overdrive, Sony assaulted us with approximately 965 trailers, TV-spots, posters, blu-rays/combo packs/special editions/tie-ins, giveaway-bundles, collectible statues...and Mysterio knows what else. I drew the line somewhere between the 46th TV-spot and the creepy cheap Electro bust they released ahead of time (no, seriously, that bust stared into your soul with haunted dead eyes), and shouted, ""FREEEDOOMMM"" or something to the accord of ""Sony, you're not getting my money."" I then laughed evilly, revelling in my illusion of power.

When I finally DID get around to seeing the The Amazing Spider-Man 2 on DVD, the film had several things working against it (not the least of which was my adoration for the Raimi films and my dislike of Webb's first effort). But I decided to lay these notions aside and see the movie with an open mind. And guess what? I truly enjoyed watching it. Most of it, anyways.

Perhaps director Marc Webb's greatest triumph is his finely-constructed cast. Andrew Garfield is a talented actor who has truly made this incarnation of Spider-Man his own. Emma Stone continues to be charming as Gwen Stacy, and her chemistry with Andrew Garfield has never been sharper. The performances from Sally Field, Colm Feore, Chris Cooper, Marton Csokas, and other talented supporting actors often lost in a truly gigantic movie, but each excellent actor imbibes his role with subtle drama. On the villainous side of things, it is Jamie Foxx who is the standout, giving the most interesting and memorable performance of the film as the pitiful Max Dillon and his glowing blue alter-ego. Dane DeHaan delivers a stunning performance as the damaged Harry Osborn, so it's a shame that he's forced to leer in bad makeup as the Goblin. Notice I have not commended Paul Giamatti. His inexplicable mugging is by far the worst performance in an excellent career.

The action deserves major commendation as well. My favourite scenes in the film involve Spider swinging through the city. Webb has made an astounding reinvention of web-based locomotion, delivering kinetic, immersive, *electrifying swinging sequences. With CGI having far advanced since 2002, Webb delivers action that Raimi could only have dreamed of. The action is just as overblown and silly as you might expect, stretching the imagination like silly putty (how's that for poetic, eh?). What's this about webs flying faster than electricity again? As I said before, the action is, on the whole, awesome in the truest sense of the word.

But what impressed me most was that Webb and Garfield had actually captured something very close to Spider-Man's heart: helplessness. For all of his powers, Spidey never gets the girl; he fails, he falls, and he gets back up again. Webb still hasn't found the soul of Spider-Man, but at least he's gotten close enough to hear his beating heart.

But now let's get down to what didn't work. As I said before, the Rhino is a joke; a silly, useless Russian stereotype that adds nothing to the film. Oscorp (aka the Home Depot for villains) doesn't work either. The shadowy corporation has become little more than a plot device and a Deus ex Machina for villains. The fact that all Spidey's enemies and troubles are connected to Oscorp comes off as a lazy contrivance. But most importantly, The Amazing Spider-Man never strikes that balance between the realistic grittiness and the pulpy comic book side that defines Spider-Man. Raimi found the perfect balance of drama and wacky comic-yness in his trilogy, but Webb's web (5 points for use of phrase ""Webb's web"") never finds that mark. Touches like Dr. Kafka and Electro never ring true because the two sides are never reconciled. In addition, the film is far too long and unfocused, and in need of a damn good assault with editor's scissors.

In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is, as far as superhero films go, perfectly adequate (it's even a major step up from Part 1). It will give you in ample share your rock-em sock-em action, dastardly villains, wise-cracking heroes, slick visuals and CGI, and even throw in some great drama and character in on the side. But poor plotting and over-eager directing lessen the impact and mean that while you will be royally entertained for 142 minutes, you will be left, upon leaving the theatre, with a distinct lack of that wonder, amazement, and awe that encapsulates everyone's favourite Web-slinger.

This Spider-Man is just not that amazing.

Poorly planned, not trusting the story arcs the producers borrowed from,  three different story lines were mashed together helter skelter, making the movie flat and uninteresting.  I was reminded of the vile """"Batman and Robin"" movie with Clooney, Thurman and Schwartznager.  CGI and bright lights can't hide the blandness of the story.  The writers tried so hard to project the teen-age angst of the 60's comics and managed to make the characters shallow and two dimensional.  They played with the villains to the point of making them laughable.  One of the challengers of doing comic book stories is suspending belief sufficiently to enjoy the movie.  I sincerely hope Marvel and Sony halt plans until they have a sense of what they are trying to accomplish.  If it's only action films, simplify.  If it's to use the story arcs, choose more carefully.  These stories bear the burden of time; messing with them is like rewriting the Lord of the Rings trilogy to make it more fun.  They will be watched by old and new readers who will look critically for flaws.  The approach to the Captain America films or the Avengers shows less is more.",1407974400,3,1272,4.6877828054298645

I just finished watching this movie and I must say it wasn't that bad.  The bad reviews were a bit harsh.  I enjoyed the movie but there were still a few things that bothered me.  The actor that played Harry Osborne was terrible!  The dude needs acting lessons!  Also, a little too much humor for my taste.  I know the Spiderman cartoons I grew up on in the 80's had a sarcastic Spiderman but I felt Garfield's humor was a bit over the top.  He certainly did a much better job speaking and did a little less mumbling (I could actually understand what he was saying in this sequel).  The other thing that bothered me was I didn't feel any chemistry between Gwen and Peter Parker which is really sad because the two actors are dating in real life.

Overall, don't let the bad reviews fool you.  It is still worth watching.  I still think the Rami movies were better and Toby played a much better and more serious Peter Parker.  But if you really need your Spiderman fix, this movie will do the trick.  I also think Jamie Fox did a great job despite what people say.

The romantic throughline is garbage, the characters are beyond thin, and the tension is, well, non-existent. They utterly ruined Electro. Could this have been a less imaginative take? Could it have been a sillier transformation from uber-dork into psychopathic killer? It's alarming how little the filmmakers accomplished with so much potential. It's like being given a canvas the size of Texas and then finger-painting with one color. When alas the one promising battle commenced (via the Rhino), the movie simply ended.

First off, I'd heard all the bad reports and reviews about this movie.....I only agree with one of them that I've heard and that was too many villains....but even that, I understand and I think you will too when you watch this and get what the writers are trying to do (which if you want, ask me and I'll give you my spoiler opinion).

I liked the first one with Andrew Garfield, I do feel he's a little bit too immature with how he portrays the character but after watching some of the Disney XD Spider-Man cartoons, he's only acting like the cartoon character does.

Good action, good story, interesting characters, some highs, a few lows but all in all a very good comic book/action/fantasy type movie for teenagers and up.  Not sure if younger kids will like or understand some of the parts, some may seem a little scary to some as well.

Still.....are they as good as the Toby McGuire Spider-Man movies.....yes and no, but lets just say they're different but both belong and carry their own weight.",1407715200,2,1021,4.587912087912088

6129355,3,B00H2FPY20,"So, I have a confession to make. I actually boycotted The Amazing Spider-Man 2 when it came into theatres. I boycotted it because Sony treated me like an idiot. Turning their marketing machine into frantic overdrive, Sony assaulted us with approximately 965 trailers, TV-spots, posters, blu-rays/combo packs/special editions/tie-ins, giveaway-bundles, collectible statues...and Mysterio knows what else. I drew the line somewhere between the 46th TV-spot and the creepy cheap Electro bust they released ahead of time (no, seriously, that bust stared into your soul with haunted dead eyes), and shouted, ""FREEEDOOMMM"" or something to the accord of ""Sony, you're not getting my money."" I then laughed evilly, revelling in my illusion of power.

When I finally DID get around to seeing the The Amazing Spider-Man 2 on DVD, the film had several things working against it (not the least of which was my adoration for the Raimi films and my dislike of Webb's first effort). But I decided to lay these notions aside and see the movie with an open mind. And guess what? I truly enjoyed watching it. Most of it, anyways.

Perhaps director Marc Webb's greatest triumph is his finely-constructed cast. Andrew Garfield is a talented actor who has truly made this incarnation of Spider-Man his own. Emma Stone continues to be charming as Gwen Stacy, and her chemistry with Andrew Garfield has never been sharper. The performances from Sally Field, Colm Feore, Chris Cooper, Marton Csokas, and other talented supporting actors often lost in a truly gigantic movie, but each excellent actor imbibes his role with subtle drama. On the villainous side of things, it is Jamie Foxx who is the standout, giving the most interesting and memorable performance of the film as the pitiful Max Dillon and his glowing blue alter-ego. Dane DeHaan delivers a knockout performance as the damaged Harry Osborn, so it's a shame that he's forced to leer in bad makeup as the Goblin. Notice I have not commended Paul Giamatti. His inexplicable mugging is by far the worst performance in an excellent career.

The action deserves major commendation as well. My favourite scenes in the film involve Spider swinging through the city. Webb has made an astounding reinvention of web-based locomotion, delivering kinetic, immersive, electrifying swinging sequences. With CGI having far advanced since 2002, Webb delivers action that Raimi could only have dreamed of. The action is just as overblown and silly as you might expect, stretching the imagination like silly putty (how's that for poetic, eh?). What's this about webs flying faster than electricity again? As I said before, the action is, on the whole, awesome in the truest sense of the word.

But what impressed me most was that Webb and Garfield had actually captured something very close to Spider-Man's heart: helplessness. For all of his powers, Spidey never gets the girl; he fails, he falls, and he gets back up again. Webb still hasn't found the soul of Spider-Man, but at least he's gotten close enough to hear his beating heart.

But now let's get down to what didn't work. As I said before, the Rhino is a joke; a silly, useless Russian stereotype that adds nothing to the film. Oscorp (aka the Home Depot for villains) doesn't work either. The shadowy corporation has become little more than a plot device and a Deus ex Machina for villains. The fact that all Spidey's enemies and troubles are connected to Oscorp comes off as a lazy contrivance. But most importantly, The Amazing Spider-Man never strikes that balance between the realistic grittiness and the pulpy comic book side that defines Spider-Man. Raimi found the perfect balance of drama and wacky comic-yness in his trilogy, but Webb's web (5 points for use of phrase ""Webb's web"") never finds that mark. Touches like Dr. Kafka and Electro never ring true because the two sides are never reconciled. In addition, the film is far too long and unfocused, and in need of a damn good assault with editor's scissors.

In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is, as far as superhero films go, perfectly adequate (it's even a major step up from Part 1). It will give you in ample share your rock-em sock-em action, dastardly villains, wise-cracking heroes, slick visuals and CGI, and even throw in some great drama and character in on the side. But poor plotting and over-eager directing lessen the impact and mean that while you will be royally entertained for 142 minutes, you will be left, upon leaving the theatre, with a distinct lack of that wonder, amazement, and awe that encapsulates everyone's favourite Web-slinger.

This Spider-Man is just not that amazing.

6129359,2,B00H2FPY20,"I know nothing of whether or not the features on the DVD are good. I only saw the film in theaters. However, I was sadly disappointed. Having either electro or the green goblin as the villain would have been a great movie. However, two villains creates two disjointed plots that don't meld together well. They do intersect briefly but that ends quickly. At the end peter defeats electro and then the green goblin just randomly shows up where peter was to fight him for two minutes before being defeated (his appearance is both too convenient and too short). Two things redeem this film: Gwen and peter's romance (really, REALLY done; that's probably because it's real since the actors go out in real life; I was heart broken but not surprised when Gwen died); and the potential for the future (we learn who the man in the shadows is and learn that the sinister six will be the villains in the next film).

6129373,1,B00H2FPY20,"I was not too crazy about the first one, but this sinks the whole thing and it DOES NOT make me wish for the 3rd!  Where do I begin?  More Goblins, more love and more unspectacular villains!

Now, of course Electro could not look like the silly character in the comic books with the green and yellow suit and lightening bolt headdress, but now he looks scary and unexciting.  This film has plots that are hanging by thin strings.  How many times must we keep seeing villains in these films get mad at the hero for dissing them over the smallest things?  That is why Electro is pissed.

Other strange things happen such as Electro being released, then all of a sudden he gets a new suit - specifically designed for him in the next scene!  Then, when (presumably) the Hobgoblin is made, he has a suit ready made form him to jump into!  All in all, the transformation of normal people into the power characters is weaker than a DC comic and I did not feel for ANY character in this film - including SPiderman.  SPiderman looked out of place in this film and seemed just as silly as a Spiderman who walks around in Times Square!

On top of that, the Rhino is a ridiculous robot, driven by a man who was not properly set up before his official appearance and was not ended.  Out of all of the villains for the Hulk and Spiderman shown on film thus far, we all would expect the Rhino to have been a guy in a Rhino suit looking more natural, not this silly robot.  In fact, all of the villains are robotic (so 80's) and even the Vulture will be as well and all from Oscorp.  It is so sad.  I was expecting a Vulture to be his next enemy but with a well developed story about him, not this craziness coming (Sinister Six).

This film is horrible!  I have not purchased the 1st one and I will not purchase this one.  I think that need Nolan to take this over!  He made a silly Batman seem realistic, while the people who made this film made a more realistic Spiderman seem unrealistic.  I put Amazing Spiderman 2 in the same boat as Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.  It is that bad and silly.",1407542400,,2093,4.248101265822785

But that aside, I found this to be a very enjoyable movie and the best interpretation of Spidey's look and personality to date. The action and special effects were amazing, Garfield's quips as Spidey were spot on, and the character interactions were, I thought, very engaging and fun. There were some false notes, but what they got right outweighed the flaws for me. I liked Amazing Spider-Man and ASM 2 equally well for different reasons (and I still like these reboots better than the Raimi films, though I do like a lot about the second Raimi film).",1407456000,3,788,4.479166666666667

I mean, how many sharks can you jump in one series?  The Raimi movies were great until Sony started pushing Venom for the 3rd movie and Raimi had to squeeze in two villains at the expense of the story he wanted to tell.  The Raimi movies were a bit old fashioned (thankfully so) and, for me, felt honest.  Sony reboots and gives us the Twilight version of Spiderman........watered down........full of hair gel to try to prop something up.......desperate to grab an audience with artifice and flash.  Even with 3d prices, the Garfield movies (at least in the U.S.) have really waned as far as ticket sales go.  That in and of itself doesn't mean anything but with this particular rebooted series, I think they lost their adult audience.  Even as a teenager, I would have hated the rebooted series in comparison with the original trilogy.  I imagine this series appeals to that portion of the younger crowd that are just looking for dumb/fun action (nothing wrong with that either).  Sony obviously realizes this and so what are the plans going forward?  All the gimmicky stuff that you'd expect.  Kinda hard to be interested though with a franchise that no longer has any heart or brains.

6129409,5,B00H2FPY20,"For anyone familiar with the comics and characters, this is a must-see. The sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man is superbly done.  The special effects are a joy to watch- and the movie is very well acted. Only complaint is that Electro looks a little cheesy and was poorly played by Jamie Foxx.

I suspect those who gave this a negative review or thought there was too much going on in the move have never picked up a Spiderman comic.  -Rarely in the comics did Spider-man ever face a single enemy at one time... he was frequently bombarded by multiple foes simultaneously.

Kudos to Marc Webb, Andrew Garfield, and Emma Stone.",1407369600,2,624,4.6454545454545455
6129410,3,B00H2FPY20,"Amazing Spider-Man 2 cannot decide if it wants to air on Lifetime, MTV, or FX.

It drowns us in sappy, syrupy, eye-rolling romance that even tween girls are calling wussy.  The back and forth is just nauseating at times, unrealistic at others.  Emma Stone is not at fault.  Wow, that girl can act.  She takes the lines and delivers them in as realistically and un-corny a manner as she can.  Garfield, unfortunately, reminded me a lot of the Muppets.  Mouth moving stiffly up and down, body bobbing.  Not the best.

Worse of all, Peter Parker sometimes talks like an inner city kid.  ""Aight"" came out of his mouth!  But very few times, thank Marvel.

Then Amazing Spider-Man 2 tries to force the fakest-of-fake buddy relationship between Harry and Peter down our throats.  Boy was that acting hard to watch!  The relationship vacillated between appearing almost too Brokeback-Mountain-hesitant friendly (if you get my drift), and cocktail-party-yuppy-fake.  Just terrible.

Peter Parker apparently loves Lyle Lovett's hairstyle in this film.  And he likes to scream things like ""woo-hoo!"" as he webs around NYC.  Not cool.  This is not Nickelodeon.

Aunt May's parts are gratuitous at best.

The Rhyno's parts are laughably bad.  He runs around in ONE SCENE in a tin can with guns.  Terrible execution of a beloved SM villain.

Then you have the subpar effects.  Sometimes Spider-Man, Electro, (and Rhyno's human head) look like they are pasted onto the background with an old movie projector.  All that was missing were the dust particles and crinkly static noises to take me back to 1975.  Not cool.  When you can see through the effects that easily, you know the movie won't have any lasting impact on fans.  Because who will want to watch it in five years?

The soundtrack . . . oh god . . . Whimsical yet child-like.  Annoyingly sweet and cliche, like old TV action films.  Then, of course, let's not forget the inclusion of--and I poop you NOT--""The Itsy Bitsy Spider.""

The GOOD!  Let's focus on that.

When the effects are done well, they are seamless and interesting to watch.  Colorful and lots of action, so you have a lot to MARVEL at.  :)

The action is fun.  Very well-done.  Feels like Spidey's style.

Foxx is EXCELLENT as the new Electro.  He is a scary monster with a twisted mind, yet he is pitiable and almost likable!  I'm not crazy about how they gave him a Sandman type of mobility, but his powers are difficult to overcome.  They did not even touch upon his ability to use machines yet.  Very cool.

Harry Osborn is played perfectly, as a slimy, hate-worthy yuppy outcast who transforms into a monstrous hate-worthy yuppy outcast--with toys!

The movie is a lot of fun when the writers back off the teen drama.  Spidey's obsession with Stacy's father's dying wish is a powerful plot point used well.  Peter's parents are frankly more entertaining than half the major cast (Rhyno, Harry, Aunt May), and I wish their secret lives and research had been explained more.

What the film fails to deliver enough of is the thing we all grew up buying comics for: Spidey versus his greatest villains!  Combat!

The two stars come from the casting of Spiderman, Aunt May, and Gwen, as well as the visuals and art behind the movie.  Unfortunately, what simply isn't there is the same thing missing from every Fox and Sony comic movie to date:  a good story.  What really grinds my gears is that this isn't a case of a studio that needs to create new content on the fly and failed at it.  This is a case of a studio ignoring decades of history and failing to improve even on the previous iteration of their own movies.

The first part of the movie, though isn't half bad.  There's some devious feeling surrounding OSCORP and Spiderman is Spiderman.  An interesting villain is introduced.  Then things start to go badly.  First off, they insult people afflicted with Schizophrenia by evil voices being the primary motivator for Electro's hatred of Spiderman.  Next, they turn their back on every good story in Spiderman history in favor of a half-baked Harry Osborne who is afflicted with some genetic disorder and becomes convinced that injecting a large dose of spider venom is a good idea and will save his life from a rash on his neck and some twitchy fingers.  It's insulting because this is a character who, in the comics, is driven mad by his pursuit of power, which is a much better and more iconic story than killing off the father to spin a thin tale of the family curse.  It helps that Harry is clearly an idiot.  This is the head of a company devoted entirely to SCIENCE.  He wouldn't have maybe leveraged the most powerful genetics firm in the world to fix him up?  Suddenly, I find myself siding with the evil lawyer in the suit.  Kid's not ready to run a lemonade stand, much less a company.

Frankly, the movie should have ended when Spiderman beats Electro in the powerplant.  In fact, if you're reading this review and haven't seen the movie, when Gwen comes out and they share a silent moment of victory, just press stop.  Sit back, take a deep breath, close your eyes, and picture some nice comic sounding music accompanying the credits.  Let it end right there, and you can probably squeeze a full star extra out of the movie.  Sure, it's a little short, and some things aren't resolved, but trust me, the alternative is worse.

You'd miss Harry showing up with a bad weave and worse makeup, albeit riding a pretty cool glider with a nice looking suit.  You'd miss the Rhino, which arguably isn't an overly interesting character anyway being made less interesting by being turned into some idiot thug in a gundam (another brilliant use of amazing technology by a petulant child with daddy issues and too much money).  You'd miss the worst death in a movie since the ending of the original Blair Witch Project.  You'd miss Peter Parker apparently living in a cemetery for several months, not watching his deceased girlfriend's commencement speech for...  reasons?  At least until his Aunt motivates him to quit sulking and go save some people.  You'd miss awful parenting by a woman who stands with her child as close to danger as the police will let her be, who then loses track of her child, who she allows to wear a Spiderman costume everywhere.  It's often said that there is a fine line between bravery and stupidity, and honey, something's wrong with your kid because he just tried to take out 3+ tons of metal powered Russian meat-head with a costume he got from Party City.

The writers should be ashamed.  Marvel should be embarrassed.  The director should be flogged, and Sony should simply admit that they're not capable of doing this right and just give the rights back to Marvel.

We, the viewers should simply be disappointed and regretful that we once again gave these morons our money.",1407369600,19,3717,4.641653905053599
6129414,4,B00H2FPY20,"Here's what I can say for this sequel. It really felt like Spiderman 3 all over again, which is still enjoyable to watch but its like there's too much stuff going on that you can't quite enjoy the film anymore. Don't get me wrong, I still gave it 4 stars cause it still entertained me somehow. I took out a star because I don't like the cheesy scenes, again its too much, in TASM 1 it was okay but in this sequel its like watching a highschool musical action movie. We really don't need that much, seeing the chemistry between them is enough. What I really hate though is how you can easily figure out the plot from the start of the movie. You'll already get hints that something bad was going to happen. Its like this film is not about Spidey facing villains, instead its about facing difficult decisions and in the end choosing the most stupid thing to do. I hope the next installment will be better!

The dialog between Peter and Gwen is especially good banter, and the Goblin's/Harry's descent into evil is nicely explained if a little over the top from an acting perspective.  As far as why they did a reboot so soon after the previous trilogy, you can argue a new take with a new direction, a desire to be more true to the original comics, or the much more obvious rationale of the almighty buck and a well that's been tapped, but not yet remotely dry.

6129419,4,B00H2FPY20,I was entertained through the whole movie. Lots of eye candy and the relationship between spiderman and his girl was very sweet without being goofy. I liked this movie better then the last. I liked that it was a bit campy. It reminded of the first spiderman from several years ago. I think the bad reviews are from boys who are attached to the other spiderman series and didn't like the fact that the movie showed an emotional intimate relationship between spidey and his girl. I think that's part of its charm and this is coming from somebody that hates chic flicks. You felt emotionally involved with the characters. Thelast movie had to much teenage angst but this movie has spidey more confident and mature. The sets and the look of the city made me want to visit such a place. Lots of neon and very colorful. The relationship between spidey and Harry was also made interesting as they were once good friends in past years.

6129424,4,B00H2FPY20,"I am not a wanna be professional movie critic and so will avoid the erudition that some that feel this is a horrible movie resort to in order to convince you that this is a horrible movie just because they say so and try to provide evidence of how smart they are.  I kind of get the feeling that some of those giving 1 star are die-hard fans of the original trilogy and are trolling to put this movie down.  With all of that being said, here is my honest opinion of the movie.

Overall I did enjoy it.  While I felt the pacing, writing, acting, directing, cinematography, and score of the first movie were nearly perfect, this one fell just a step behind on all of those points save for acting and cinematography.  Like many sequels, the pacing felt horribly rushed in the first 30 minutes of the movie and there were a few points where I was simply thinking WTH.  In addition to the frenetic and jumbled pace, the first part of the movie also had me a bit worried because I felt that they were flirting very dangerously with making this too campy with a fully cheesy performance by Fox prior to his rebirth as Electro.  If the whole movie had followed the pattern of the first part, I would have been very disappointed.

The remainder of the movie is much better.  The pacing settled down, the cheese factor was minimized, and the story became coherent.  The subplot/exposition surrounding Peter's parents seemed a little detached from the rest of the movie but overall it was fine.  The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is excellent.  The introduction of the Goblin, while abbreviated, worked well in the context of this film.  And, as much as I would have doubted it at the beginning of the movie, I thought the ending was tidy and leaves you wanting another film.

I was a huge Spider-Man fan as a kid.  I watched all of the cartoons, had the costumes, even watched that live-action mess and loved it.  I did like the first trilogy but knew at the time that it wasn't quite ""right.""  I've always enjoyed Maguire as an actor and he was entertaining as Spider-Man but he just wasn't Spider-Man.  Garfield just makes a better Parker.

Whatever this movie's flaws may be, it does capture the spirit of Spider-Man and his universe quite well and was an entertaining movie.  If you're looking for comparisons in the Marvel world, I'd say it's better that Iron Man 2 but doesn't hold a candle to The Winter Soldier.",1407283200,5,2416,4.523041474654378

It's a shame, because ASM1 was okay. They leaned too heavily on Peter being 'destined' for greatness as opposed to just a freak accident. Unfortunately this film also leans on the destiny angle. Badly. The Destiny crutch is a sign of a bigger problem-the script in this film is just bonkers bad.

They cram too many villains in, and each one has worse acting than the previous. The storytelling, dumb decision making, pacing, everything about this is wrong. Even the soundtrack is bi-polar.

It's one of the few films I've actually counted down the minutes until it ended. Even the action is uninspired. One scene at the end of the film regarding the hero and his love interest is done well, but other than that... It's a shame. The reboot series started well but this film is so overloaded and nothing goes anywhere.",1407196800,18,900,4.6835443037974684
6129433,5,B00H2FPY20,"I will never understand the hatred this movie has accumulated, not because there are FAR worse superhero films out there, but because The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an honest-to-God outstanding exploration of the themes of abandonment and hope that has fantastic character arcs, stunning action sequences, and a great narrative that's surprisingly complex in its structure.

In this sequel to the also-underappreciated ""The Amazing Spider-man,"" Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone return as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, respectively, and, once again, their chemistry lights up every scene with joy, honesty, and love (it doesn't hurt that they were actually dating in real life). Peter is having difficulties adjusting to his life of happiness with Gwen as his girlfriend given that he had promised to honor her dying father, Captain George Stacy (played by Dennis Leary), and his last request to keep her out of his life for fear that she would suffer the violence Peter attracts as Spider-man. Though Gwen believes that it's only her and Peter's decision to be together, Peter is conflicted morally and ethically about continuing their relationship, despite completely loving her. Already, the movie gives us a complex emotional core that isn't going to be simply solved with a bad-guy/good-guy fist fight (it's that complexity which I think most detractors of the film don't like).

Alongside the main (no pun intended) thread of the film, Harry Osborn (played outstandingly by Dane Dehaan), Peter's buddy from his childhood returns to New York to run his recently deceased father's business, despite his hatred for the company and for his father's strict, cold upbringing. Harry is dying of a rare genetic disease that will eventually kill him like it did his father and needs Spider-man's blood (for reasons that are well-explained in the film) to save him. This also brings in a fresh set of moral/ethical complications for Peter since the last time he had given someone the key to his genetics, he helped create a monster that terrorized the city. There's also the sub-plot of Peter's Aunt May (Sally Fields) who is struggling both with the finances of their living situation (that Peter tries to help with) and her fear that Peter's dedication to find out more about his parents means that she will be left behind.

Peter's narrative arc runs parallel with Harry's desperate search and Max Dillons' (Jamie Foxx) turn from rabid fanboy into supervillain. Mentally unstable and tragically pathetic, Max is a firm believer in the good of Spider-man ever since he was personally saved by the hero, giving him a delusion that he and Spidey are best friends. Due to an accident, Max is turned into a electricity-laden superpowered individual who views Spidey's attempts to stop him as a betrayal for his own personal glory (though this is a far more complicated matter in the film than how I'm explaining it). ALL of those story threads together AND Paul Giamatti delivering a fun, chewing-the-scenery performance as the Russian mobster Alexsi who actually becomes the important narrative bookends for the story that I won't go into here out of spoilers.

There are some elements that feel a little off, like the overly-villainous Dr. Kafka, the rather quick ending to Peter's search for his parents, and the underutilization of Felicity Jones as Felicia Hardy, but all of the choices (even the ones that don't entirely ""click"") are done for the sake of telling the story and character development. I had been unfortunately spoiled on a ""big scene"" in the film that's an emotional roller-coaster, but the film is so expertly written that, watching it, I felt as though I were experiencing it as freshly as someone who had never seen the film before.

This film (moreso than any other superhero film or Spidey movie) portrays Spider-man as the common man's hero. A guy not only willing to foil a robbery or save people from a car crash, but intrigued and happy to talk with the people on the street. The filmmakers show that it's more than his responsibility to protect the citizens of New York - it's his joy. It's also important to note that with the evolution of the series, the character of Peter Parker has become more confident and thoughtful without losing any of the charming every-man quality in the previous film. With more confidence growing up as a man, we also get a Spider-man who FINALLY nails the dramatic/comedic balance that the hero has been synonymous with over the years.  Andrew Garfield performs Peter Parker with boundless charisma, enthusiasm, and effortless humor that, if not THE defining iteration of the character, is one of the best realized adaptations of the character in the history of the Spider-man franchise.

As clichd and tired as this sounds, ""The Amazing Spider-man 2"" lives up to the adjective in its title by being emotional, complex, thrilling, mature, and thought-provoking in a way that we don't see in superhero films, all while showcasing the need for true optimism and hope even in the face of overwhelming despair.

To Marc Webb, the crew and cast of the film, the studio execs who took a risk on this material, and everyone who helped get this movie done and into theaters, I say, ""Thank you."" You've given me the Spider-man film that reminded me why Peter Parker is one of my favorite characters of all time, and why Spider-man is my favorite superhero.",1407196800,275,5397,4.975609756097561

6129438,3,B00H2FPY20,"Webb's second installment into the world of the Amazing Spider-Man is here. Does it impress? Yes. Does it do enough to stay afloat in the midst of the other superhero movies in its genre? Just barely. Garfield's portrayal of Spider-Man is noticeably improved. You begin to see him come into the web-slinger role a lot more relaxed and understanding. He's funny and corny as you would expect. And the kids who watch the movie will love him just as much as they did in the last installment, if not more.

As Peter Parker, though, he's only as good as his supporting love interest (both in and out of movie), Emma Stone. As noted by other reviews, the chemistry of the two on-screen is one to behold, but with the running time of two and a half hours, the relationship takes more screen time than it should. This point brings me to the villains of the movie. We start with the Rhino. His entire appearance in the movie isn't quite explained. Somehow, the audience is tasked with knowing how he came to be and what his motives are before we sit down. One thing the previous movie did was establish The Lizard properly, but unfortunately, Rhino didn't get the same treatment. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon was cliche. I felt an Oscar winning actor with much more charisma should have been able to give a better performance. When he ultimately becomes Electro, I can't distinguish between the two characters, which throws the idea of an ""alter-ego"" out of the window. Dane DeHaan gives a pleasant surprise performance of the entire movie. His acting skill is put to the test with Harry Osborne/Green Goblin, but he pulls it off. Because you see more of him in the movie, one could argue that he should have been the main antagonist in the film, especially if you consider he was the better of the three villains.

Overall, the movie was entertaining. It shines brighter than its predecessor and there's some enjoyable moments in the movie. However, the plot can be hard to follow as many other side stories are told alongside with it. Add in some things we've seen already in Raimi's trilogy and it can be easy to lose your focus and interest. As evident in the third act, the franchise will continue to grow and delve deeper into the evil that is OsCorp, but I truly hope they pay more attention to fixing the arcs in the story before the cobwebs get too plentiful and annoying to dust.",1406937600,5,2382,4.589201877934272

I don't think Marc Webb or Sony Pictures actually wanted to make this movie at all, they HAD to in order to retain the Spider-Man rights and because the impending Sinister Six movie is such a cooler concept....so enjoy this ""movie"" in the meantime. Andrew Garfield does well, but every performance is completely hindered by the characters being written as one dimensional and the aforementioned confusing story that doesn't allow either growth or the establishment of motivation. Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a bad guy because he's jealous. Harry Osbourne (Dane DeHaan) is a bad guy because he's angry. Aleksei Systevich (Paul Giamatti) is a bad guy because...he's Russian? He's in the movie for such a short amount of time I don't even know why they have the Rhino on the box art. I guess they need him for Sinister Six.
This movie is two hours of ""What the...why did that happen? Who is that guy? Why did THAT happen? Where am I?"" and to make matters worse, call it a nitpick...no stinger clip at the end. Nothing to tease the next spider man film or the ultimate fate of Norman Osbourne (Chris Cooper) who disappears in the beginning of the movie or maybe even Venom or...well...anything.

Even the X-Men got their act together and made a decent movie, but Sony is committed to making mediocre Spider-man movies because they know people will pay to see them anyway. Who cares if they're not about anything, have no scenes worth remembering and are only propped up by the romantic chemistry of two people who should be playing college graduates or grad students and not high school students.

But before i begin i will say that the amazing spiderman 2 was a little step up from the first one, that being that the costume in this movie was much better and the movie was much less dark in trying to incorporate that dark knight feel but unfortunately was the only good things about this movie.
The amazing spiderman 2 is definitely in the list of the worst comic book movies ever to transition to the silver screen, most of the time i felt like i was watching a video game and NOT an actual movie. It's simply laughable and just down right stupid in most parts. The main villain electro played by jamie foxx was just horrendous to say the least, why o why did they cast this guy ? not to say that jamie foxx is a bad actor, he was just totally wrong for this role. Electro is one of spiderman's MOST feared and powerful villains and they casted a comedian, mark webb totally made a grave error in casting in general. Whether or not people even wanna admit it the amazing spiderman 2 also branched of sam raimi's spideman 3 by having to much going on. Which means there was very little chance for story which in turn made this film convoluted. This movie overall was just terrible, horrible actors, wasted and unused villains that serve no purpose, terrible sequence and a shi**y dialogue.

6129461,3,B00H2FPY20,"Go Spidey Go! This was my most anticipated film of the summer and probably of the year. And I'm not going to lie when I tell you I was let down. As I write this, I have seen a total of four films that have been released this year. Each of which received a rating of 3 stars or below, and that is not good. I was highly surprised when I saw the reviews of 'Amazing Spiderman 2' clocked in at a mediocre 2.5 rating out of a possible 5.0 star rating. That's about average. I thought this was going to be better, and while I won't say it was that mediocre it was certainly a step down from the much superior 'Amazing Spiderman' as well as the original trilogy. My review of 'The Amazing Spiderman 2'.

'The Amazing Spiderman 2' follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) who after the events of 'Amazing Spiderman' struggles to discover the mystery of his mother and father's disappearance as well as his ever growing love for Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). But when an old friend arrives (Dane DeHaan) as well as a spider obsessive (Jamie Foxx) who's horrible accident causes him to become a electricity charged super villain who calls himself Electro, come into town it is up to Spiderman to save the day!

So much happens in Amazing Spiderman 2, it is hard to compress a summary f it all for you guys, without spoiling anything. With all this stuff going on, it's hard to focus on anything. Beside's that sub plot with Peter Parker's father and mother, we also have a subplot with Oscorp, a subplot with 'Dane DeHaan', a subplot with Garfield and Stone, a subplot with 'Sally Field', a subplot with 'Jamie Foxx', a subplot with Ravencroft Institute.... TO MANY SUBPLOTS. And to top it off we have the main plot which is on Spiderman fighting villains! Director 'Marc Webb' tries's to cram so much story into a 2 and a half hour film it's hard to comprehend or become attached to anything.

While we're talking about overstuffing with plot, let's get to the overstuffing of characters. There are WAY too many characters in this. The film tries to stuff all of 'Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborne's character development into one film and it doesn't work. Not to mention with all these characters it's hard to focus on who's the main one. Jamie Foxx's Electro is supposed to be the main villain yet he gets lost among the characters, and becomes sort of just there. Unlike in the first film, Gwen Stacy is just there. All she is meant to do, is walk around and say 'I can't be with you Peter' or 'I love the real you Peter'. It's upsetting as Emma Stone truly is a gifted actress, but her character got side-saddled to suit the large ensemble of characters. Don't even get me started with Paul Giametti's Rhino, who is there just to be there for about 5 minutes of film. I'm pretty sure, that the studio wanted to try and cameo almost every single Spiderman character there is.

With all the characters you aren't become emotionally involved in any of them, and that includes the ending, which should of left me in tears but it didn't. Harry Osborne's discovery should have left me sad, but it didn't. Electro's character should of left me with symphony for the guy, but it didn't.

I'm not going to lie, the visuals were amazing. While there are few action sequences to speak of those we do view are pretty breathe taking. Electro's fight on Times Square was just gorgeously rendered, as was Electro himself. Dane DeHaan's transformed Green Goblin was amazingly done. And way superior to the cheap looking one done for the original Goblin. And Spiderman himself, when he flies thru the sky is beautiful and realistic looking.

The performances were fine. 'Andrew Garfield' and 'Emma Stone' who share romance off the screen, share great chemistry on the screen as well. The relationship they implied was realistic, and both actors have charm and charisma. Not to mention Garfield's almost perfect sense of comedic timing. Spiderman was made for Garfield. And Stone holds her own, I mean it, I would see another spiderman movie just for her alone. 'Sally Fields' is underused to say the least, but in what meager scene's she has, she makes the most of it, playing a sweet and lovable Aunt May. 'Jamie Foxx' is Electro. Yeah, I was skeptical at first, when I heard he had been cast but now I'm sure he was perfect for the part. While he kind of when a bit far in his performance, in was still nice enough and he tried hard. 'Dane DeHaan' plays a creepy Harry. While I won't say he was better than Franco, he was pretty solid. And out of anybody who could play Osborne after James Franco, I would have said DeHaan. And then there's 'Paul Giametti' as Rhino. He's over the top and too hammy. And his accent is probably one of the accents I have heard, I could not comprehend anything he said.

The costume design and make up affects are also well put to use. I liked Spiderman's new suit.

The editing was way too choppy during action sequences, particularly during the opening scene involving a plane, as well as a scene in the end involving a very green goblin.

The music was well chosen for the scenes used, it added emotional under tones, as well as a sense of fun when particular scene become a bit too serious. I particularly liked the end credit music from 'Alicia Keys'. It was a catchy tune.

All and All 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' has an over abundance of characters, choppy editing, less then successful character development, but still the film works with the help of a nice chemistry between leads 'Andrew Garfield' and 'Emma Stone' as well as some nice supporters including 'Jamie Foxx' and' Dane DeHaan'. Plus, it helps that the visuals are spectacular and the music, fun. Plus kudos goes to director 'Marc Webb' for a very surprising, very emotionally gripping and powerful ending. But this Spidey sequel still was a disappointment. C+ 5/11/14

'The Amazing Spiderman 2' is rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence, some scenes that may disturb or frighten young children, and some language.",1404691200,5,5987,4.612206572769953

The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an ambitious movie; it's not perfect but since when is ""not perfect"" a suitable judgment for anything.

6129467,4,B00H2FPY20,"First things first... this film is not going to win any Oscars (well, maybe for special effects, some of which are extremely cool). This is a comic book movie, and better yet, it's a Spider-Man movie. If you love superheroes, and especially if you love Spider-Man, you will love this movie.

Andrew Garfield nails it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is, in my mind, the best actor yet to take on the role. There's a genuine ""New Yawker"" vibe about him when he's wearing the suit, and when he's delivering his one-liners, you totally buy that he is SPIDER-MAN.

Jamie Foxx does a fine job as Electro. He's that bumbling guy we've seen before in comic book movies who accidentally becomes super-powerful, and finds that with great power comes great irresponsibility. If nothing else, he's fun to watch.

Paul Giamatti also does good as the Rhino, though he only gets about five minutes of screen time. I believe he's mostly in this movie to set up for the next one.

Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne was a brilliant choice. Even though his part feels a bit rushed, I think DeHaan delivers. Chris Cooper plays his dying father. I thought that would have been great had we seen Cooper play his bit as the original Goblin, but hey, this movie is already pretty long.

The real star of this movie, though? Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. She is electric on the screen. She brings a lot of charm and humor to the scenes she's in. She's absolutely adorable.

Now, as to the movie itself... yes, there's a lot going on, with three villains to follow and a love story to tell. It does make the movie feel a bit long at times, and even a bit random. And the score sounds out of place, like it came from Captain America. I found that all forgivable, though, because I'm a life-long Spider-Man fan. Again, how much you like this movie is going to depend on how much you like the genre and the characters; for me, I loved it.",1404172800,5,1899,4.473988439306359
6129468,5,B00H2FPY20,"To me, incredible art has always been imperfection. Why is art even worth talking about if we cannot debate the pros and cons, and offer our own interpretation and analysis of each individual work of art? The beauty of art is that it is such an individual experience. We are creators of art ourselves, but we also look at a piece of art and it impacts us in a different kind of way. Some people may look at a piece of art through a pair of specks and believe that it is flawless, another person may be able to see its flaws and not be able to look past it, while the flaws and imperfections of another piece of art may be the reason why we love that piece of art: because imperfection is how art relates so closely to the human experience.

Spider-Man is exactly that, and this quality and many more is what makes the character evolve so effortlessly into whatever time period, and it is one of the many reasons why he is my favorite fictional character of all time. However, like the character himself, his source material has ranged in perfection and imperfection. Spider-Man has had some of the greatest sources of stories and media in the recent decades, but he has also had stumbles in every form of media, including some of the comics from the 1990s, as well as some over-cluttered blockbuster films (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, SPIDER-MAN 3!). Spidey material aims for greatness, but like the character, sometimes does and sometimes does not hit the mark.

Returning two years after a fairly successful reboot and being reloaded with three villains and multiple storylines, the important question is this: does The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hit the mark?

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 picks up shortly after the events of the first film. Whereas the majority of the previous film dedicated the majority of its time to developing Peter Parker into Spider-Man, the sequel establishes right away that Peter is indeed an amazing Spider-Man. He is really good at being Spider-Man at this point, he loves it, and this gives Peter a boost of confidence both in and out of costume. Of course, as we know from most Spider-Man stories, Peter has about as much luck as Superman does a home planet... to put it bluntly, he has none. Peter is internally struggling with keeping the promise that he made to Gwen Stacy's father to stay away from her, is struggling to be both Peter Parker and Spider-Man while trying to please people who encounter either one (or, in some cases, both), and is still emotionally impacted by the disappearance of his parents when he was a kid.

However, another big, underlying conflict of Peter is the external conflict: super villains. These of which include Max Dillon, a slightly obsessive electrician whose freak accident and hunger for power turns him into Electro, Harry Osborn, an old childhood friend who is eventually turned into a greater threat, and Aleksei Sytsevich who has a cameo appearance as the Rhino. Without spoiling too much about their involvement in this film, the villains, in the end, are linked through one central component: OsCorp.

With everything going on, one might be thinking of Spider-Man 3 with the number of villains and subplots. Being a hater of Spider-Man 3, the early word from critics had me worried somewhat about that. However, rest assured that this is NOT Spider-Man 3. If you're worried about the number of villains, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is able to balance the characters well, putting more emphasis on some characters, and less on others necessarily.
And while there are a lot of events packed into this two hour and twenty two minute long film (which flows by without a dull moment by the way), suffice to say, it all feels pretty well connected together. And unlike Spider-Man 3, the structure is not burdened by plotlines that don't need to exist; the content here feels necessary for the story being told, which not only ties up loose conflicts from the first film, but is also able to create new elements that are even better.

Let's talk villains. Rhino is ultimately there primarily as a cameo, and while his role is fun and ridiculous, it isn't as relevant to the plot. One of the main villains is Electro. Electro in the film is essentially carries a part of us inside: we all want to be that cool person; the one who inspires us. We all want to believe in that. In an unfortunate turn of events, however, the bad luck of Peter Parker causes Electro to feel betrayed by Spider-Man, even when it wasn't his fault. It causes his perfect image that he built up in his head to be crushed. Some people may say that Max is just a crazy guy, but the concept of building up people in our heads only to be let down by them is an interesting concept. It makes for a villain who is well developed and, while may not have the amount of time that one individual villain would have, has plenty of enough development to understand him, and to fear him when push comes to shove.

The main villain of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, however, is Harry Osborn. Harry Osborn in this film is given the most screentime of the three, and justifiably so. Without giving away exactly what role he plays, his motives and characterization is by far one of the best I have seen of the character in any interpretation. At the start, his character is extremely likable, and even as he goes down the path of evil, his motives remain understandable and relatable. Furthermore, when the motives push him over the line and full on turn him into an antagonist, he is extremely creepy. And I mean that in the best way possible. He is easily the leading antagonist in this huge plot.

While to some this may be considered a flaw, one of the things that I found unique (and to me quite awesome) about the script in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the structure felt a lot like a comic book. What I mean is, like a comic book, the film's story jumps between some quieter moments to louder moments to excite the audience and then back to quiet again. Some have complained about these creating awkward tonal shifts, but I never found the tone to be inconsistent. What was effective about this style of storytelling is it added to the comic book feel of the universe that they were attempting to establish with this film.

And speaking of that comic book world, what a world it is. Now that the origin story is out of the way, director Marc Webb and confidence have gained a sense of confidence going into this story, and thus are not afraid to expand on the elements of the Spidey verse that work so well. They add a small amount of classic Spidey cheese without making it overbearing, they continue to expand Spidey's humor in satisfying ways, and they introduce villains and plotlines from the comics that, while take some liberties, ultimately translate incredibly well on screen. The little kid inside of me (or, okay, I am mostly a kid still) shouted from inside multiple times as these characters were brought to life in ways that embraced the source material. It leads to a more entertaining product, and if for nothing else, the confidence in the story makes for a film that is incredibly fun to watch.

What's even more amazing is, if you take a moment to analyze the film further, there is a lot of deep content to find thematically. Giving away specifics would risk spoiling the film, but every conflict in the story has some sort of impact on the character of Peter Parker. What works so well about the multiple plot line storyline is that the script consistently asks this question: How does this impact Peter Parker? The question of emotional impact is a difficult question to answer effectively with this scale of story, but Marc Webb is able to overcome the challenge. Every conflict mentioned above has a meaningful impact on Peter Parker and his development throughout the story. It may not appear as surface level as in some movies, but like a great story, that is the fun of digesting the film. There are layers here that the script, and director Marc Webb, create to make not only the other characters and conflicts have more meaning, but to make Spider-Man one of the most fleshed out characters in a comic book movie.

Of course, while the themes of the film are fantastic upon deeper inspection, there is still a lot to love from a casual audience standpoint. The humor has been vastly improved from the first Amazing Spider-Man film, there are villains with personality and life, and regardless of whether you are a casual audience member or not, there is a lot of heart in this story. After seeing the film two times right now (if this section doesn't go away, that means this has not changed since my first two viewings), there were multiple moments where I cried during the film, there were a dozen laugh out loud moments, and there were many moments in terms of satisfying comic book content and satisfying storytelling content that made me want to stand up and cheer.

Yes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has a lot going on. If it were under different direction, or handled with less care, it could have been a mess. However, the amount of ambition that the filmmakers had with this project, amazingly, turned out to be in their favor, as The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a heck of a ride that phenomenally combines great comic book spectacle with genuine heart and some of the most truly impactful sequences I have ever seen in a comic book film. It all adds to a film that extracts a ton of emotions, including fear, excitement, joy, sadness, and many more. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is able to extract all of these without ever losing sight of the excellent source material that it is based around.

One of the biggest strengths of the first Amazing Spider-Man film came from its cast, and this film is no exception. One of the biggest surprises was Sally Field's performance as Aunt May. While I loved her in the first film, the content she is given in this sequel proves to be even more emotionally satisfying, and giving Sally Field the room to perform creates a few of the film's most memorable moments. Just as effective are the three antagonists in the film: Jamie Foxx is great as the awkward and at the same time menacing Max Dillon (one particular scene made me feel genuine sympathy and fear at the same time), Paul Giamatti has a lot of fun as the insane and over the top Aleksei Sytevich, and my goodness is Dane DeHaan the perfect choice for Harry Osborn. DeHaan brings out the most essential elements of the character (mild jealousy, selfishness, yet kindness) from the comics and making them his own. It is a great interpretation of the character, and one that I think will be a great addition for this franchise for years to come.

Of course, the real stars of the film are the same stars as the first film: Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. Emma Stone is absolutely electric on screen. She has great comedic timing, is strong willed, smart, THE OPPOSITE of a damsel in distress, and sweet and charming. Emma doesn't really seem to be acting here, as these qualities seem so natural in this role. You can really see why Peter falls in love with her; she is truly the best female love interest in a comic book movie. Like the first film, we fall in love with Gwen Stacy, and her chemistry with Garfield only enhances this sense of love that we as an audience feel towards her.

Speaking of Garfield... wow. I was absolutely blown away by his portrayal of the character in the first Amazing Spider-Man film, but his performance here is even better. Garfield not only has great comedic timing for the Spidey quips, and he not only has just the right amount of awkwardness for the character of Peter Parker (despite his confidence boost). Garfield also has a heart of gold. Anyone who complained that Peter was unlikable in the first film can rest easy. He is absolutely selfless and caring, while also staying true to himself and his moral values, even in the face of great potential danger. It is so true to the character that I fell in love with, and Garfield has as much fun playing Spidey as I do watching it. Garfield displays a true genuine sense of humanity to every single scene he does, which, amazingly, is not broken when he goes in costume. You can practically feel him crawling out of the suit even when he is in it.

The cast does a phenomenal job, and the visual effects department is just as strong. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 includes truly some of the most beautiful Spider-Man imagery I have seen on screen. For once, the 3D effects are fantastic, the CGI is so seamless that at times I thought it was a real stunt, and the choreography of the fight sequences is great. The action scenes are just long enough to feel a sense of excitement and satisfaction, without dragging on too long to feel heavy handed like they did in some films like The Avengers and Man of Steel (both of which I still liked, though!). Furthermore, the cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning. Practically every shot in this film feels like it was ripped straight off the pages of a comic book, especially with the vibrant colors as a result of the new tone that is established in this film. And oh is it great.

Webb is confident with his story, confident with his cast, confident with his action, but what is even better is the fact that you can see elements of him being just a great filmmaker, period. One particular thing that he does exceptionally well is match visual elements with music. And no, I don't just mean the great uses of Hans Zimmer's fantastic new Spidey score. Remember the skateboarding montage in the first film with the song ""Till Kingdom Come"" by Coldplay? There are a couple of scenes like that in this film as well, and they are excellent. It really displays that this director really isn't just interested in spectacle, or just romance; he is interested and passionate about the entire filmmaking process. And these sequences, along with many others, result in a film that is constantly extracting emotion even during the quietest moments.

And this is a testament to the creative team behind the film. Yes, this new Spider-Man franchise was created so that Sony could hold onto the rights of the Spider-Man character, but it is clear that the creative team behind the film care about Spider-Man. They care so much that they have created a film that is truly a comic book film in every sense of the phrase: progression of story, style of imagery, and presentation of themes. With a character as strong as Spider-Man with so many great stories to tell, this is probably the smartest decision that they have made.

Going back to what I said earlier about art, the interpretation of it is in the eye of the beholder, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is truly a testament to that. There are people who will see the plot as crammed, the action as far between, and the tone to be too comic book style for their liking. However, what many people consider to be flaws in art are seen as enhancements of it. To me, the scale of the story only adds to the emotional scale, and the payoff is oh so satisfying. The action sequences are great and give us just enough to be satisfied without shoving it down our throats. And, while these films came to be because of companies not wanting to lose their most successful property, the filmmakers behind The Amazing Spider-Man 2 clearly have one goal in mind: to create the most amazing (no pun intended) Spider-Man experience for an audience.

There are a lot of pieces of this puzzle to fit into place in order for this to happen: you have to have a script ready for ambition, you need a cast ready to face that challenge of ambition (and to accept the criticism), and you need people to put as much time into their editing process as comic book artists do into their coloring. What's so amazing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is that it does all of these things. In the end, they have created a film that is truly Spider-Man, the character and lore that I have had a ridiculous obsession with since I was four. Films and comic books, of course, are entirely different mediums, but it is about time that film audiences are able to experience the somewhat foreign territories of the comic book lore while also experiencing the native territory of great filmmaking.

The masterfully executed combination of these two things is what is most amazing of all.",1404086400,10,16361,4.6077556623198355

6129470,5,B00H2FPY20,"Spoilers! I'm 19 now so I was only a kid when Raimi's movies hit the theaters. As a kid I grew up on Spider-man spending most of my money on comics and you couldn't believe how excited I was when I found out he was coming to the big screen. Well I saw the movie and was so disappointed my parents and I left before it finished. Needless to say I didn't go see the second one but I found out Venom was in the third I gave in. Big mistake as it was even more disappointing than the first. So as I grew older I figured ""hey I was a kid, maybe I'll like it better now that I'm older."" It couldn't be further from the truth, I cringed at how awkward Peter's conversations with MJ were and at just so many scenes  in general. Also MJ was nothing more than a generic damsel in distress in his movies, nothing like MJ in the comics. Well the years went by and I didn't watch TAS because of the damage Raimi had done (he should stick to Evil Dead) but something enticed me to see the sequel. What a decision it was. Gwen and Peter were a great couple and Gwen was such a likable character. Unlike Rami's villain formula (main villain would show up, beat spider-man to a pulp and then kill themselves) Marc's reimagined villains were so much more. Electro's love/hate relationship with Spider-man was done very well, glad they didn't go the ""hit by lightning and now a villain"" route. I've always thought the GG was a cool villain for the web head but his #1 enemy Gobby does not make. I always thought Venom was a better fit for that position, especially how Spidey could slap him around in a fist fight as soon as he's gotten him off his glider. Marc changed my mind however, Harry was the Goblin once in the comics but he wasn't nearly as cool as in this movie. People complain that he wasn't in the movie long enough but IMHO his development into the villain and what he did as a villain were much better than Raimi's Masterchief/Power Ranger rip off. All in all this movie was true to the comics while taking it's own much welcomed creative spin. Don't mind the critic reviews, they want to take the escapism out of comic book movies and replace it with realism.",1404000000,4,2157,4.260975609756097

6129472,3,B00H2FPY20,"When it was first announced that the Spider-Man franchise was getting a reboot after Sam Raimi's trilogy, I approached the first film with a hesitant interest. Raimi's set of films was not perfect by any means, and they arguably did more things wrong than right, but Tobey Maguire was an enjoyable enough Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and I had a hard time envisioning ""that kid from The Social Network"" playing the part. However, after witnessing Webb's take on the classic character, I was pleasantly surprised with how well it turned out, and I eagerly anticipated the sequel.

Unfortunately, this anticipation began to wane as the details of the next film started getting announced. A blue Electro? Jamie Foxx? A Rhino who resembles a Transformer more than the actual character? Paul Giamatti? They're seriously trying the ""three villain"" thing again? It appeared they were doing everything wrong, and I honestly didn't want any part of it. I knew I was still going to see it, though (it was a new Spider-Man movie, after all). The only difference was I wasn't going opening night/weekend, and I wasn't excited. At all.

Surprise surprise, this latest installment in Webb's universe pretty much failed in all the categories I expected it to. What I didn't expect, however, was the way it redeemed itself in other areas of the film. Yes, Electro looks like a cross between Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze and Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, and Foxx's performance is as stiff as cardboard, but the writers absolutely nailed Spider-Man's personality. This was something they dabbled with a little bit in the first film, but they went all out this time around.

I can honestly say we finally have a Spidey on screen who embraces the webslinger's humor. I'm not talking one or two jokes here and there, either. I'm talking about 140 minutes of consistent laughs. From start to finish, there is an endless barrage of jokes from your friendly neighborhood arachnid, and I was relishing in their inherent corny-ness. Because, come on, Spider-Man isn't suppose to have the ""best jokes."" They need to be cheesy, and I'm glad a team of writers were finally able to properly execute this aspect of his personality.

The success of Spider-Man as a character also comes from Andrew Garfield's performance, as well. I had some issues with certain areas of his portrayal/performance of Peter in the first film--certain things were out of his hands, of course--but he really stepped his game up and found his groove. He's erratic and quirky, but he manages to pull it off without looking like he's trying too hard. He's no longer trying to be Peter Parker, he kind of just is. His performance is arguably more fluid this time around, which helps authenticate some of the more emotional scenes in the film.

Some other highlights include the romantic chemistry between Garfield and Stone, and Dane DeHaan's portrayal of Harry Osborn. After watching the real-life couple on screen together, I am thoroughly convinced that all on-screen couples should be played by couples in real life. It brings an entirely new dynamic to the performances, and the actors don't have to convince the audience that their characters are in love because the actors themselves are in love. It makes the relationship between Gwen and Peter all the more genuine, and the film benefits greatly because of it.

Of course, it would be a crime to go through this entire review without at least mentioning DeHaan because he exceeded any and all expectations I had for his performance. This man is quickly becoming a favorite of mine because he really submerges himself into his characters, and he continued this trend with his performance as Harry. Although he may not look like Harry Osborn from an aesthetic perspective, he nails his personality in ways Franco could only dream of. It is made 100% clear that he despises his father, and as the film progress, and Harry starts losing it, DeHaan's wonderful acting truly comes into play.

Unfortunately, in addition to all of the negative points listed above, all of these great elements are weighed down by a huge flaw: the film is too content heavy. This is not to say it is hard to follow along with what's going on, but it did reach a point where I felt like there was just too much to digest at once. There were four or five different plot lines in the story, there was a constant tonal shift between what was going on with Max/Electro and what was going on with Harry, there were Peter's relationship issues, Peter searching for the truth about his parents. It never stopped. They could have easily split this into two coherent films, instead of one onslaught of information.

Some last minute inclusions: I was glad that Webb didn't include any of the weird POV shots that were found in the first film, and I loved the new suit. These were two of my biggest complaints with his first offering, so I was more than happy to see these minor details addressed in the sequel. Also, for the most part, the cinematography is beautiful. There was a fight scene in the beginning that had some nauseating shaky cam, and the scene where Harry transforms into the Green Goblin has some terrible lighting, but other than that, the set pieces, action sequences, and CGI are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also a lot of fun to watch.

Overall Score: 6.8/10 - Let me make one thing clear: I wanted to like this movie. I may have went in with low expectations, but this is still Spider-Man, so I didn't want to hate it. To be perfectly honest, I don't. I may not feel like this was a proper follow-up to its predecessor, but I certainly don't hate it. I will watch it again, and I will buy it on Blu-Ray, but this is more of a testament of me as a fan, and not of the quality of the film itself. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does a lot of things right, this is true, but for every accomplishment there is an accompanying failure, and the film as a whole suffers because of it.",1403827200,12,5965,4.75
6129473,4,B00H2FPY20,"My review may sound like i didn't like the movie but i really need to point out these things. Oh and on a sidenote i like the character spiderman alot and andrew garfield so i can't just dislike (not bias but just saying) on to the cons.

-electro

seriously man can you get more cheesy, his villian could of been epic if he didn't have such bad lines and bad character devolpment to work with. I mean cmon show a better villian, I like epic villians such as those in dark knight trilogy (bane joker and ra's) and then there's electro.... Him idolizing spiderman, him hating spiderman later on just did not make sense whatsoever to me

- THE LOVE STORY

Okay i get all superhero movies need love stories but this movie just over-did it.  They pushed too much romance into it and the film focused way too much on gwen and him rather than rhino electro or goblin, I paid to see spiderman vs electro and epic fight scenes, not a love story because we ofcourse haven't seen that done many times. It just gets boring.

Now finally on to the good things.

+spiderman (the movie shows way too much in the trailer i admit spiderman had his moments, lots of action and good stunts)
+green goblin great character and much better villian then electro in my opinion, i just wish he was more in it
+i liked the aunt may moments in the movie
+Aside for some romantic scenes, no scene honestly was boring or felt dragged on
+ i liked all the oscorp plot reveals
This movie knows when it neeeds to be serious and also had its comedy moments that actually worked unlike thor 2. but anyways it answers alot of questions from part 1 and i loved the ending, they are setting part 3 up to be the biggest movie and im very excited. Would highly recommend if you liked part 1, oh and i think it's better then part 1 slightly.",1403654400,4,1802,4.313609467455621

Now the new movies with mark web directed he did a better job because the two movies are just like the comics and spiderman was funny now I know that a lot of people didn't like the ending of the second movie because it didn't show him and rino fight it ended with him throwing the cap at him. That was disappointing. now the third movie hes going to meet mary jane but no word of a villain yet. and going to be relased in 2018 because the 2nd movies didn't make its budget with 200,000,000. but finnaly the movie is worth buying its a good family movies and tons of action in it its totally great to buy. sincerely,

Effects are good but the story line is all over the place. Too much I Spy sidebar in this go-round as well. If you compare this series to the original it's already running out of gas. From a  good movie perspective, the new Spiderman 2 is not as good a movie as the original Spiderman 2 movie.

Harry should have been the main focus, I could go as far as saying there wasn't a main focus at all. So much was deleted and if it was kept in it would have been an even bigger mess. Its an alright film overall but a good 40 minutes is where it just gets sloppy.

6129478,4,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spider-Man series I think is the prime example of critical injustice. Raimi's original films were so highly praised by critics that these new films, despite holding a different taste, are victim to the burden of comparisons. Raimi's films were exaggerated and cheesy, when Webb focuses more on psychological principles. That's why I loved the first film so much, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a superhero sequel superior in almost every aspect. While being 2 hours and a half long the film keeps a steady, and fast pace where it always has a conflict building to keep you invested. Each scene feels important to the emotions emphasized in the film so no minute is wasted. Peter and Gwen are one of the most believable couples in cinema and their relationship is the core of the story, and it never gets overshadowed by the main villains or sub-plots. A major complaint I hear of the film is that the reveal of Peter's parents backstory is disappointing, but the movie explains it's only a tidbit of information, and that Marc Webb is building up the whole truth within each movie. Therefore, it builds the suspense immensely in this film and we get to see his parents as fully breathing and living characters rather than a plot catalyst. The humor is much stronger this time around, as it has become a bit more light-hearted and slapstick in comedy, but never goes over the borderline like the original trilogy did. This offers more to the younger audience as the darker shades of this film are quite adult and dramatic. This brings us to the strongest aspect of the film, the theme: No human deserves to be alone, and isolation and abandonment costs immense psychological damage. Every main character has this theme imposing them somehow, and it really adds to the relatability of the characters. Even the villains have humanity in their motivations due to this theme, and that is very rare for a superhero film. The directing is almost Stanley Kubrick-esque in some senses. Action sequences rely on musical cues and tones for movement and emotion, which has not been implemented well in superhero movies until this film. It makes the fights all the more memorable and impressive, as my heart was racing during the climax of the film. Several scenes possess an almost dream-like quality, with dramatic lighting and celestial-like movements. It drifts you away from reality, unlike other superhero movies which usually emphasize upon the realistic world. Spider-Man's world is advanced and foreign, yet familiar in emotional comprehension. Only real issue that holds this film down is that it perhaps drags on a bit after the climax, as the following scenes don't flow together as the rest of the film does, making the ending perhaps a bit overdone. This is definitely a more artistically-directed film than the first one, and it accomplishes that well. Overall, I must exclaim that it replaces ""The Dark Knight"" as my favourite hero flick. It's a universally emotional and significant film, with a more meaningful and overlooked theme than the Dark Knight offered. It made me realize how much others do impact who we are and how it defines our virtues; a film that is emotionally powerful rather than philosophically can just sometimes mean more. This movie is the only one that has EVER made me shed a tear. Hate me all you want, but I love artistic liberty in film and interpreted the themes in this movie personally. You can make this film your own, and that makes it all the more fun and meaningful. I give ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a solid 8/10.",1402876800,7,3568,4.850819672131148

6129480,3,B00H2FPY20,"After the action-packed opening twenty minutes (that includes one important episode about how Peter Parkers parents left their son), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suddenly slows down, taking too much time following the relationship between the now grown-up Peter Parker/Spider-man (Andrew Garfield) and his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), as well as the origins of Peters old friend Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan), and an electrical engineer Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx).

The thin story is stretched out to 142 minutes while there is little to next to no character development. Harry Osborn and Max Dillons sudden hatred for Spider-man is unconvincing, and so is Peter Parkers decision to fight crime as Spider-man. Is he  having fun?

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 offers stunning visuals, but lacks the storytelling skills of other Marvel Comics film adaptations.

6129484,3,B00H2FPY20,"Stan Lee's original idea in the creation of Spider-man was to portray a typical teenage kid with all the navigation problems of someone of that age while also including a superhero alter-ego in the mix. Peter Park, who becomes Spider-man, was in his original conception an orphaned science wiz-kid who was bitten by a radioactive spider which gave him powers and abilities similar to those of a spider while still remaining a human being. Unfortunately, the present installments of ""the Amazing Spider-man"" on film with Andrew Garfield as Spider-man has changed much about what made Peter Parker a compelling character.

While Garfield is a relatively convincing actor playing roles 10 years younger than his real age, the studios have opted to re-invent Peter Parker as a cool hip late teen. Instead of the nerdy wiz kid of the 1960's and 70's, the new Parker looks more like the lead singer of the latest all-boy teen pop sensation. The problem with Garfield as Peter Parker is he's just too cool and good-looking. He dates the best-looking girl in school, who also happens to be the valedictorian, and sports perfect hair and complexion which were probably made possible by the make-up artists of Vogue Magazine. Peter Parker of the original never quite fit in as a teen in school, and his becoming Spider-man helped him act out a kind of fantasy which he couldn't as Peter Parker. I think the biggest problem I had with believing Garfield was Parker was that I didn't see why the best-looking male in school would need to don a costume and right wrongs. For the nerdy not perfect-looking Parker it makes more sense. For the way-too-cool Garfield who looks like Justin Bieber's older brother, I couldn't buy him as Peter Parker, the brilliant but geeky kid who wasn't popular. Garfield comes off as the not-so-brilliant but highly popular teen who would have a waiting list of girls who desire to date him.

Aside from the problem with casting, the current film has some interesting aspects and very confusing plot elements. The film begins with a flash-back of a couple we learn later were Peter Parker's true parents, Richard and Mary Parker. Richard has been engaged in some kind of top secret project which turns out to be both lucrative and very dangerous. Fast-forward to the present. Parker, now just graduated from high school, learns that his father and his boyhood friend Harry's father were both involved in research to foster regeneration through DNA found in spiders. Harry has now inherited his father's corporation, Oscorp, but also has inherited a degenerative disease. He comes to believe a transfusion of Spider-man's blood will offer him the regenerative abilities he needs to cure himself.

At the same time, at Oscorp, a lowly but brilliant technician through an accident, gains power through electricity, becoming one of Spider-man's archenemies, Electro. At first, the person who became Electro and Harry appear to be on good terms with Peter Parker. Eventually, they both become his adversaries. Intertwined through the story is the love affair between Parker and Gwen (Emma Stone). For some reason, I felt the love story aspect was allowed too much screen time, and the other plots about Harry and Electro were underdeveloped. The story becomes a kind of foursome, with Harry and Electro challenging Spider-man and in some ways his girl Gwen, who also works for Oscorp.

A decent but somewhat confusing story. Much screen-time is devoted to long action sequences and the love story, but the plot about the corporation and the secret research is underdeveloped and not explained thoroughly. While still relatively entertaining, the script probably needed about 2 or 3 more rewrites. Less Spider-man flying around and more about his father and the secret research.

I also think that Emma Stone was a great Gwen Stacey. Jamie Foxx is epic as Electro. I honestly think this movie wouldn't have been as good with any other characters.

Do have an open mind and enjoy the new take on the comic, it's not Raimi, it's not a copy or comparison to Sam Raimi's  Spiderman trilogy. I am a bit puzzled by people who are always confused when there is more than one villain. Reviewers complained in Spidey 3, that it was ""confusing"" ""too much going on""  ""too long & boring""  and now Amazing Spiderman 2 is getting a lot of the same knocks. Doesn't make sense to me, the plot wasn't confusing and it wasn't boring. Some fans are just going to reject new takes on films, and some are knocking it because Jaime Fox was Electro. I liked Superman with Christopher Reeves but I also like Man of Steel with Henry Cavill, I thought that was a new take on a classic and it worked. CGI is a part of every film, even Raimi used CGI, what would Star Wars have been without them?  Remember MJ has to enter the story, even in the animated series they got married, MJ was always a more established and significant character than Gwen Stacy.

6129489,2,B00H2FPY20,"Not as jaw-droppingly bad as ""Spider-Man 3"" a few years back.  But few movies are.

""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is just plain boring.  I lost count of how many times I squirmed in my seat, just praying it would end.  The film could benefit from some serious editing -- lose about 40 minutes of running time and MAYBE it will be tolerable.

Three, count 'em, THREE villains in this film.  The one that appears first (and also last) can be taken out of the film completely and you'd never miss him.  The primary villain is Electro, but you don't really root against this guy so much as stare at him in confusion.  It's hard to grasp why he's so heck-bent on killing Spidey.  The motivation he is given in the script is very, very feeble.

I don't know anyone who really cares that much about Peter Parker's birth parents or how they died.  Yet the two of them get a very long and absurdly Jason Bourne-esque action setpiece near the beginning of the film.  It feels tacked-on and unnecessary.

And Sally Field as Aunt May is given way more to do than her character's presence calls for.  You just gotta see it to believe how absurd it is.

The script is long, unfocused, and feels like it was written by committee.  There's very little natural flow to the story.  The whole movie seems like a series of moments very clumsily strung together.

6129491,2,B00H2FPY20,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a thoroughly disappointing sequel, and nothing cements that fact more than the bloated and completely unexpected ""What-the-heck-just-happened?"" final act of the film.

I could rant about how stupid Jamie Foxx looked as ""Electro"" (he bears ZERO resemblance to the classic villain of the same name, and his acting was one-dimensional and prosaic), as well as how ludicrously lame Webb's version of ""Rhino"" looks (even lamer than Sam Raimi's robotic, huge-headed ""Green Goblin,"" which pretty much ruined the original Spider-Man film for me -- I just couldn't take it seriously), not to mention the superfluous length of the film (overkill), excessive use of CGI and Matrix-style, slo-mo visuals, and the glaring mistake of making Harry, rather than Norman, Osborn the Green Goblin (who looks like a meth addict, although he at least appears somewhat creepy/menacing, as opposed to the silly mechanical Goblin from 2002 who couldn't frighten even a small child). But all of those things are mere fleabites compared to what I consider the ultimate deathblow to this whole ASM franchise:

They killed Gwen Stacy.

HOW could they justify KILLING Gwen Stacy?!

Yes, I am fully aware of what happened to that character in the original comics; however, that does not mean the same thing needs to happen in the film adaptation, especially when the character in question has a *significantly* greater role in the ASM movies than she did in the source material.  (Put another way, just because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD.)

Furthermore, since when do superhero movies remain faithful to the original comics anyway? If they did, characters such as Rhino, Electro, and the Green Goblin would look ... oh, I don't know ... remotely like they did in the comics, perhaps?! THERE'S an idea! And please don't tell me they couldn't find a way to make them look ""right"" on the big screen. Just save it. After all, they got Spidey right, so why should his arch-enemies get shafted with crappy costumes/appearances? I had always looked forward to seeing the massive Rhino in a live action movie, too. He could have looked so cool, such as John Gallagher's digital drawing titled ""Rhino Rampage."" So much for that. Instead, we were given a cheap, ED-209 knockoff that looks like it swallowed a man's head. WHY? Just ... WHY?!

More importantly, though, everyone who's seen the Amazing Spider-Man films knows good and well that the highlight of these movies -- indeed, the only ingredient that's truly indispensable -- is the undeniable, real-life chemistry between Garfield and Stone. With Gwen Stacy now out of the picture, however, that chemistry (on-screen, that is) has been extinguished -- and with it also goes the very heart of this rebooted film franchise.

This was an unbelievably shortsighted, boneheaded decision by the producers/writers, especially this early in the series. Unless they come up with a way to bring Gwen back to life in the next film or else find some other way to restore Emma Stone to co-starring status alongside Andrew Garfield (some have suggested that she could play the role of Mary Jane Watson, for instance), then I cannot think of a single appealing reason to watch future ASM sequels.

On a positive note, to his credit, I believe Andrew Garfield portrays the Spider-Man character with greater charm, humor, and likability than Toby McGuire.  His rapport with children is particularly touching.  Garfield's version of ol' Web Head reminds me of the Spidey I remember from the comic books and classic cartoons (e.g., Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends).  It is not his fault that the writers/director effectively sabotaged the film series in which he stars by eliminating the irreplaceable Emma Stone/Gwen Stacy.  Stupid move, guys.",1401667200,7,3779,5.0954692556634305
6129492,2,B00H2FPY20,"This is quite possibly the most overstuffed movie ever made. It's hard to think of another film that attempts to dump so many antagonists, subplots, love interests, etc. into one film. If you didn't like the similarly excessive Spider-man 3, you'll loathe this one too.

For some reason, the filmmakers keep pushing the mystery of Peter Parker's parents (though Uncle Ben doesn't even get mentioned here.) So be prepared to thrill at numerous scenes of an angst-ridden Peter Parker sleuthing through old newspaper clippings and grainy videos, often during an emo-backed montage. This is only a mystery for the sake of there being a mystery, as the subplot has zero impact on the actual narrative and is not particularly gripping either. I guess it's just another shameless trick to try and lure you back for more in future installments too.

So beyond that waste of time, you have Peter's personal relationships with Gwen, May and now the newly introduced Harry. The two boys pal around in a laughably corny sequence to show you how they're BFFs though you never heard of the guy till 5 minutes ago. And let's have Spider-Man battle Electro, Goblin and Rhino. Need more? Let's cram some more story in like Harry's illness, Oscorp's takeover, Gwen's school application, Electro's nonsensical origin and motives. Don't forget the horribly out-of-place ""detective Peter"" subplot too. The whole stew would've been far more palpable if done better, but it's a complete hodgepodge of ideas. Tonally, the movie haltingly shifts gears from polar opposites like childish comedy to techno-thriller within seconds. Perhaps the Peter/Gwen chemistry is decent, though their scenes together are the same ""love you, but can't be with you"" claptrap which is rehashed ad nauseum.

What works is Spider-man and the spider action. The glib tone and attitude of everyone's favorite web-crawler is spot on. The soaring and spinning camerawork is a blast too. Raimi's original sequences were superior, but this version's wild fights and rescues while dishing out silly quips are still great. Unfortunately, those moments are in short supply, and the advertisements reveal all the best parts. (I don't know if that phenomena is because a bad movie needs to desperately sell all its finest parts, or if a movie becomes bad because the viewer is not thrilled by these moments anymore. Probably a combination of both. Anyhoo...)

A final needless and overstuffed insult arrives at the end with a big, shocking event, which should have left the characters helplessly reeling from its heavy ramifications. But instead, the can't-do-enough Amazing Spider-man 2 takes this final revelation and squeezes an entire movie's worth of consequences and emotions into another nifty little 10-minute span. The rushed ending/epilogue is another offense to all of the characters we're supposed to care for and relate to, giving them short shrift in the process.

The hurried and unresolved style of the story makes the entire film feels like a giant prologue. This comic-book movie is easily the worst offender of rushing to spawn a never-ending franchise in the future versus making a good movie in the present.

Spider-Man. Webs. Special Effects. Fighting. Villains. Part 2 (of the reboot).

What did I think?

This sequel is an odd movie in that for every pro theres a con.

It features a very average plot and awkward dialogue (seriously, think George Lucas' Phantom Menace level of poor dialogue) but it is punctuated with some incredible action sequences. One framed shot in particular had me exclaiming out loud.

This time around Garfield gives us an angsty and partly stupid Peter Parker which once again grated, but Emma Stone and Sally Field excelled despite the quality of the script.

The decision to add new aspects to the origin story felt completely unnecessary and, if anything, reduced the impact of the iconic Uncle Ben (not to mention stretching the very limits of credibility). And these additions tended to add to the odd pacing without benefiting the plot in an way at all.

Its better than the first one (though thats not necessarily saying much) but I can at least say I had some fun this time around. Not enough to see it a second time mind you but it gets a passing grade.",1401580800,3,1102,4.678756476683938
6129495,5,B00H2FPY20,"Many people dislike this movie, and can never give me any reasons. At least, they can't list any reasons that they don't have merely because they didn't pay attention. People have told me ""Harry and Electro's motivations for hating Spider-man are unclear."" Really?

The movie is great, regardless of what anyone says. Electro was fantastic, even though at first I didn't like Jamie Foxx's casting. He is just a two-bit hood with electric powers in the comics, but in this film, he is a lonely guy who feels like Spider-man is stealing the spotlight he deserves.

Harry wants Spider-man dead because Harry believes Spider-man's blood can save him from the disease that killed his father, and is killing him. When Spider-man turns him down when he asks nicely, he decides to recruit help to take it by force. The scene when Harry asks for Max's help is great. You really feel like Dane Dehaan is desperate. And Max's reasoning for helping Harry was pretty great. Harry says, ""Max, please, I need you!"" And for a guy like Max who no one cares about or even notices, it's a pretty big deal to have someone actually need you.

The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is fantastic. And it plays out nicely in this movie, even though they spend most of the film broken up because Peter can't bring himself to keep breaking the promise he made to Gwen's dad as he was dying.

SPOILER ALERT:

The death of Gwen Stacy was handled nicely in his film. The best part is that before Green Goblin drops her, she had helped Peter defeat Electro, which showed that Gwen isn't the typical damsel-in-distress like Mary Jane was in the Raimi trilogy. And Andrew Garfield's performance as he cradle's Gwen's body is fantastic. You really felt like the guy was devastated. Since the movie's release, I have heard and read many complaints about Gwen's death, many believing that they shouldn't have killed her. Frankly, I think people are just upset that they didn't do the already exhausted cliched ""Character dies but is revealed to still be alive"" from almost EVERY SINGLE MARVEL STUDIOS MOVIE.

I've heard complaints from people that Rhino not actually being defeated at the end means the movie was ""incomplete"" and that the entire film was brought down by the ""unanswered question."" Here's how it went, Spider-man uses the manhole cover to bust open the mechsuit, Rhino is arrested, end scene. I thought it worked great.

The movie was great, and many complaints I've seen people have are issues that are easily dismissed by actually paying attention to the movie. If you think the villains have no real motivation, than maybe you should pay better attention. If you think that Peter Parker has no character development in the movie, than you didn't pay attention.

Frankly, it's better than the lackluster garbage that Marvel Studios has put out since Avengers (and that in itself was lackluster). The only stand out film the Marvel Cinematic Universe has is ""Winter Soldier."" And that has it's fair share of issues, no matter how much people want to claim it's ""Perfect."" Frankly, Amazing Spider-man 2 would have been rated ""Perfection"" had it been part of the Avengers movie universe. Because I've noticed that those movies aren't allowed any criticism.

If you like Spider-man, this movie will be enjoyable for you. If you just like a fun movie, this movie will be fun to watch. I give it a 5 because it's a movie I could actually sit through more than once, unlike films like Iron Man 3.",1401408000,9,3471,4.7716666666666665

Amazing Spiderman 2

Wow, what a movie!  I did like the Sam Raimi versions, but this actor has really gotten down the wisecracking wallcrawler down pat.

The story is one of relationships, of making decisions and of paying the consequences, some of which are not that great.

There are many deviations from the original comic book story by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, but I am happy with the whole Gwen Stacy/Peter Parker story.  Unlike the Raimi films that concentrated on Mary Jane Watson, it was Gwen who was one of Peters very first loves (yeah, Betty Brant was there too, but I digress).

Another variation is that they're not high school kids but college grads.  Gwen makes a great valedictorian speech about hope and about what to do when there is every reason to give up.

Another subplot deals with Peters dad, Richard Parker.  Why was he abandoned?  Why was Peter left with thinking his dad was a bad guy?

Plots!

Wait, am I describing a comic book movie or what?

One thing about this film is that a general audience who has a passing interest in comics will like the film.  Women will likely love the Peter/Gwen relationship, and how the ghost of Capt. Stacy gets in the way of Peters decisions regarding her.

Guys will like the wallcrawler spinning through NYC, capturing the bad guys and being interesting in the corporate plans of Oscorp, an ostentatiously benign group that has been working on plans for domination, making a better world through intimidation perhaps.

Bullied!

Jamie Fox is great as the unwitting subject of an experiment that turns him into Electro, who becomes an intelligent force of Nature.  How will Spidey defeat him?  And the Goblin, Harry Osborn, also at the short end of the stick when it comes to be accepted by those who matter most.  I hope there is more of him to come.  Lots of potential here.

Secret labs, a crazy Harry Osborn who has a fatal disease, the Goblin as youve never seen him and some hints that a Doc Octopus or a Vulture is in the works (check out the secret lab with its armored tentacles or the vulture-like wingspan on display).

Listen to the ringtone, old timers.  Guess from where that is?

Final Word:  And check Sally Field  she has not lost her flare for drama as an Aunt May who knows her boy is not her bio son, but she raised him that way.  Pretty powerful performance.

Check it out.  And stay through the credits!  Amazing how people still walk out when there is so much more to know about our friendly neighborhood Spiderman.

A mid-credit scene, but my theater did not have an end-of credit scene.

They pretty much met up to my expectations. Spidy is back and this time his foe is his best friend Harry Osborn or the Green Goblin and Max Dillon or Electro played by Jamie Fox. This one, like the third one in the McGuire trilogy, just had too much going on. It was too bogged down and wasn't able to flesh the plot out more. My favorite thing about this movie is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. You can tell those two are together in real life. They work perfectly together. I just love Emma Stone. She is great in everything. I also think Dane DeHaan, was a perfect actor for Harry, but I though Jamie Fox was a little miss-cast. He was convincing as the nerd side, but not as much as Electro somehow. Jamie Fox, like everyone else in this are quality actors who did the best with the script they had.

6129500,5,B00H2FPY20,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Just as some reviewers disapproved of a perceived erratic, unfocused, villain-heavy plot structure in Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman 3"", I suspect a similar charge has been leveled against Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" (hereafter ""AmSp2"").  It's a legitimate criticism, I suppose, which I happen to respectfully disagree with in both movies.  Yes, numerous plot threads have been spun out in ""AmSp2"", with Oscorp at the center of all:

  1)  Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy's (Emma Stone's) high school graduations and tumultuous,  rocky romance, and Gwen's Oxford College prospects, complicated by Peter's/Spiderman's promise to Gwen's deceased father, Police Chief George Stacy (Denis Leary) to stay away from his daughter, for her own good.

  2)  More revelation of Peter's parents', especially his father Richard Parker's (Campbell Scott) mysterious link with and scientific research for Oscorp and the purpose of that research, and whether Richard is an American traitor or not.

  3)  The transformation of geeky, overlooked Oscorp electric engineer Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) into supremely powerful, embittered, and vengeful electricity master Electro.

  4)  The business, personal, and medical dilemma of Oscorp heir and Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who seeks Spiderman's spider-serum blood to reverse a genetic disorder and gradually transforms into the supremely powerful, embittered, and vengeful Green Goblin.

  5)  Peter's efforts to live as normal a life as a superhero can, without his Aunt May (Sally Field) discovering her secret, while in turn Aunt May tries to keep her moonlighting stint as a nurse's aide to help pay Peter's college tuition a secret from him as long as possible.

  6)  Oh, yes, the transformation of flamboyant Russian mobster Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) into the Rhino (or more appropriately, Iron Rhino Man Tank) after Spidey thwarts his plutonium theft from, apparently, yes, Oscorp.

  7)  Peter's methodical efforts to untangle, solve, and resolve the six previous plot threads, even drawing an elaborate map on his bedroom wall to link things up.

So, yeah, I guess you can argue ""AnSp 2"" is busy, overplotted, and too reliant upon soap-opera coincidences and melodrama.  And yet, I think that is part of the movie's charm.  ""AmSp2"" reflects just that soap opera charm that made the various Spidey comic permutations so popular and memorable.  Also, that charm elevates the movie above simply an exclusive and eventually tiresome hero/villain slugfest.

For example, no doubt, the Spidey/Electro and Spidey/Green Goblin battles are energetic and suspenseful.  But they also illustrate a specific interconnectedness between Spidey and his enemies.  In a way, these villains are dopplegangers or distorted reflections of Spider-man, put-upon, neglected, tormented, ultimately sympathetic souls suddenly gifted with enormous powers, except of course they use their powers for evil.  But consider, there but for the grace of Uncle Ben/Aunt May would go Spidey.  In other words, Uncle Ben's/Aunt May's love and care of Peter have helped keep Peter from going similarly astray.  Furthermore, he does not necessarily get full satisfaction from defeating them.

As another example, Spider-man does not monopolize ""AmSp 2"". As in the first ""Amazing Spiderman movie"" Peter Parker and his compassion, sense of duty, scientific ability, and deductive reasoning get at least as much attention as his alter-ego.  He does his best to protect the people he cares for and loves and balance his normal, everyday tasks with his superhero crimefighting.  Spiderman may not always succeed and may suffer another personal tragic loss, as in his climactic encounter with the crazed Green Goblin, but he always finds the courage and spiritual strength to honor the memories of the fallen by carrying on, as alluded to in Gwen Stacy's inspirational valedictory speech.

Therefore, even in Spider-man's fantastic, intertwined world of sinister CEOs, unscrupulous ""Kafkaesque"" scientists, genetic manipulation, and power-hungry supervillians in ""AmSp2"", there is still room to remind the viewer that we all have the power (super or not) to find hope to keep on living, keep on hoping, and keep on making a positive difference in people's lives.  If a bespectacled 5-year-old Spidey fan can confidently face a rampaging iron rhinoceros, we can certainly face our daily woes.",1401148800,3,4473,5.491202346041056
6129501,4,B00H2FPY20,"Okay, I'll start this review off by stating that I've enjoyed most of the recent Spider-man films.  I liked ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" despite its flaws and all of the flicks in Tobey Maguire's run as Spidey except for the third film in that franchise.  It was poorly executed, had the kid from That 70's Show in it ruining Venom, and just had too much going on all at once.

I figured that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" would fall into the same category as ""Spider-Man 3.""  Thank goodness that I was wrong.

The film starts off with Spidey (Andrew Garfield)  facing off against Rhino (albeit without his armored suit shown in the previews).  That little event leads up to Peter Parker's graduation from school and brings viewers up to speed on the state of the Wallcrawler in relation to the city and, more importantly, to Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).  The city loves him for the most part, but a few detractors believe he's getting in the way or needs to back off a bit.  Gwen still loves Peter, and he struggles daily with the promise he made to her father in the previous film to stay away from her.

Meanwhile, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is bumbling his way through life.  Despite being extremely intelligent, Dillon coasts from day to day as a relative nobody.  Oscorp has taken credit for his work, and he has a really terrible self-image.  All he wants is to be noticed, and when Spider-Man saves him early in the film, he embraces Spidey (at least in his mind) as his best friend.

Through events that I'll leave out so as not to spoil anything, Dillon becomes Electro, and all of Dillon's insecurities turn into hatred of pretty much everyone, including Spider-Man.  After clashing with the Webslinger once and failing, Electro makes a pact with Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), freshly ousted from Oscorp and bent on revenge against Spider-Man himself.  I won't give the reason why he wants revenge, just know that it ultimately leads to him becoming the Goblin.

This leads up to Spider-Man clashing once again with Electro and then facing off against the Goblin.  Can Spidey stop them both?  You'll have to watch the film to find out.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  Yes, there's plenty to complain about, such as the off-kilter actions of some of the characters and the terrible CGI Rhino suit that will hopefully be fixed if Rhino shows up in the next film.  However, the strength of this film lies within its cast, specifically Garfield, Stone, and DeHaan.

Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker.  He perfectly embodies the smart-aleck kid who mouths off to villains the entire time he is fighting with them.  The crowd laughed throughout Spidey's battles because he was extremely funny.  Stone, despite having multiple sugary sweet interactions with Garfield throughout the film, made Gwen a likeable character.  She and Garfield played off of each other perfectly, making scenes between lovestruck young adults bearable.  DeHaan came out of nowhere to give one of the best performances in the film.  I was not aware of any of his previous work, but his portrayal of Harry was spot on.  The only hiccups in the film were from Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon and Paul Giamatti wasting space as Rhino.  Dillon was terrible, and Foxx failed at the portrayal.  However, once Foxx became Electro, he became much more interesting and just a slight bit more believable.  Giamatti has two brief appearances in the film, so he doesn't effect the overall story that much.  He's basically injected to open and close the film with a little bit of humor.  I could have done without him.

The film, despite being almost two and a half hours long, moves at a very fast clip and held my attention throughout.  There is one particularly heart-tugging moment at the climax of the film, and while I myself didn't cry during that moment, a lot of people did.

So, is ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" better than the films that proceeded it?  Yes, except for ""Spider-Man 2,"" which is one of my favorite superhero films of all time.

I recommend this film to fans of comic movies and for anyone who loves excellent action with a lot of humor (laced with some very disturbing moments as well).",1401148800,4,4170,4.7375
6129502,2,B00H2FPY20,"Wow. Just when I thought a movie couldn't be worse than Spider-Man 3, along comes the Amazing Spider-Man 2.

Yes, Spider-Man 3 had its issues, huge ones. However, in comparison to a movie franchise that apparently had to be rebooted due to it's predecessor, it's at least more fun to watch....unlike the sequel to a reboot.

The huge noticeable problem, the Villains. Did Jaime Foxx watch Batman Forever before going onto set? It's 2014 people. The age of super cheesiness should be over. Yes, I understand this is a film based on a comic book, but if you are going to have cheesey elements for humor's sake, THEN HAVE IT FUNNY OR ENTERTAINING! Not groaningly awful to watch. Like Halle Berry in Catwoman, here's hoping that Foxx receives a golden Raspberry for the year.
Contributing to the cheese is the soundtrack for Electro's screen time. Everytime Electro (even prior to transformation) is viewed, we have this whispering dubstep playing. Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams probably thought it was innovative to have this attached for their villain, but its more annoying and uneeded.
Next up, Harry Osborn. The intention is to have this guy be a rich bratty kid who asks too much for his own sake. What we get is an actor who does nail it on a emo teen level, but has some of the hardest dialogue to stomach through. To make Harry's undeniably cheesey fate even worse in the film, it slams right into an area of,""what, wait, why!? that's retarded"" level."" To reasoning and logic behind the transformation of Harry into Green Goblin  was executed poorly and just laughable. Do not expect much from it. Like Venom in Spider-Man 3, tacked onto the end for...the hell of it I guess.
The Rhino: Already a dumb villain to begin with in the comics, but once again, could have just stayed completely out. I agreed with the idea  of a the exo-mech suit version from watching the trailers, but when you actually it in action, it's  very awful looking. Good thing there isn't that much screen time of it.

What's definitely improved from the previous entry is Andrew Garfield's acting. This time he actually made an effort to make Peter Parker less annoying, and more like the Spider-Man us comic nerds love. I'm not sure if that was intentional since he was more of a teenager in the Amazing Spider-Man and now more mature. Possibly the director listened to critics about Garfield's performance of the last film and understood that angst and Shia Lebouf stammering is never a fun thing to watch. But remember, this was an effort and an effort that still does not help amend the terrible things in this movie.
It was nice to see more of a real person wearing the suit and interacting with other actors during calmer sections. Spider-Man is one of the few super heroes protrayed in movies where the city he protects actually appreciate the vigilante. The Spidey-humor in TASM2 is actually good this time and not jerkish as the previous installment displayed. The script writers actually inserted some good one lines for the web head and I'll admit that I actually laughed. Not in spite, but it was actually funny. The web slinging CGI action is significantly improved. Even some Electro parts are well done.

However, much like how I felt about Man of Steel, eventually something else dumb happens and I am immediately reminded of why I hate this movie. Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker moments can literally tie the movie down. The chemistry is good between the characters, but you could get a vibe that Marc Webb's forte is directing romance interactions better than the main scifi action material. The Continuity and the sci fi reasoning for why Oscorp is the way it is undeniably typical and too obvious. It's a cliche that we have seen so many times from watching movies, TV, and playing video games. In the original Spider-Man trilogy, Oscorp was just a backdrop. Only James Franco's Harry and William Defoe's Norman were the real villains. The explanation of Norman's disease and his ""disappointment"" with young Harry is explained poorly and just idiotic. Get ready to be forced fed ""The Corporation is really this or the corporation is really that"" scenario. Come on, could they not have thought of something else more sinister, like Iron Man's The ten Rings as the embodiment of the true evil? Once again, it's like Sony wrote this movie to display what they envisioned of a Spider-Man film. Not a filmaker's vision, not a comic book geek's ideal, but a company...The irony here is actually hilarious when you think of it.

""No, Spider-Man is our experiment! And we'll reboot him as many times as we need to with terrible movies that convey no real vision of the character! BWAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"" More movies! More crappy video games! More!"" --Some Sony executive.

Look, if Joss Whedon and other directors of the Disney Marvel movies can make demi-gods, men in machine armor, the Hulk, and a WW II super soldier interesting for a present day setting, then why the hell is the Amazing Spider Man 2's struggling at this? All of the kinks should have been ironed out with this installment, and yet more problems emerged. I wish Sony would give it up and hand it over to Marvel. It's severely obvious Marvel knows how to make thier source material watchable instead of putting franchise property ownership first. A true Spider-Man fan can notice that and not that it ""needed"" the rebooted due to one movie. ""But Spidey always had web shooters!"" Sorry, that is just not enough of a reason, guys. What we are inclined to get in the future of this franchise are probably more poorly executed what-could-have-beens or sounded-good-on-paper-but-dumb-to-watch movies.

6129504,3,B00H2FPY20,"Superhero movies are easy to please. They all follow a basic formula, originated by their comic book predecessors, but followed religiously in movie form. The superhero sequel goes as follows: Hero is reeling from the events of the previous film, where they defeated the villain and mainly came out on top. Superhero is enjoying life and mainly not doing anything. New villain comes to town, and screws things up for superhero. Superhero ultimately defeats villain and saves his loved ones. End titles.

""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" a continuation of Marc Webbs 2012 reboot to the Spider-Man series, doesnt really follow said formula - for better and for worse.

Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is in an odd on-again-off-again with his true love Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and is enjoying public admiration. Max (Jamie Foxx) is a genuinely nice guy who inadvertently becomes the villain (Electro) by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) causes trouble too, but is kind of glossed over to make room for Electro.

Andrew Garfield did a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire in the first of the film reboots. This one almost witnesses the death of his acting abilities. He nails the big emotional scenes near the end of the film, but has an odd way of delivering normal lines in the earlier portion of the film, which is really off-putting and kind of disappointing that this actor sank so fast within the length of one movie. However, like I said, he does the important scenes in the end well.

Supporting actors like Sally Field and Jamie Foxx have nice moments, but supporting characters are often glossed over in movies like this. A major plot event in the films third act that all of the comic book fans saw coming almost ruined the film for me. It is something that these movies don't tend to do. I give Webb and the writers credit for staying true to what was in the comics, but at the same time, I cant help but think they shouldnt have.

The film also does an iffy-at-best job of showing Max Dillons journey from normal guy to villain. You get the idea this guy never wanted to hurt anybody in the first place. So how is the audience supposed to react accordingly to this villain when we don't really know his full story?

Overall, I left the movie not thinking it was a massive improvement over the first film, like I did with the second film in the previous Spider-Man trilogy. It was more or less a continuation of the first one, and a commercial for the next film. And a commercial for Sony, Netflix, Blu-Ray, and everything illuminated in lights at Times Square during a pivotal battle scene. Product placement kind of ruined the mood in a scene where there should be bigger things on the audiences mind. Im not saying Im done with these films. But they really need to step up their game in the third installment.

6129505,2,B00H2FPY20,"2012s The Amazing Spider-Man, released 10 years after the Sam Raimi original, left fans split  some felt the love story was too strong, others (such as myself) loved Andrew Garfields version of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, resulting in what I felt was the best Spider-Man movie yet  just behind 2004s Spider-Man 2.  Now, 10 years after that momentous sequel, director Marc Webb and leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) have returned to kick off the Summer 2014 movie season with The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 kicks off where the first left off, with Peter struggling with his feelings for Gwen Stacy  given that he promised her dying father that hed leave her out of his superhero lifestyle. Hes never been better as Spider-Man, though, nor has the film, giving our first glimpse of the web crawler in action in a fun, hysterical chase scene through the New York City streets. Spidey inserts himself into a conflict between a few dozen cop cars, a Russian gang (lead by Aleksei Sytsevich, played by a scenery chewing Paul Giamatti) and oh yeah, a bunch of stolen plutonium.  This sequence bops and weaves, is incredibly exciting, and gets you into a good groove for the film.

The biggest problem? Its not actually how the movie starts.  Instead, viewers are thrust first into an extremely tedious sequence featuring Peters parents, Richard and Mary Parker, showcasing what happened when they left Peter with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, as they attempt to leave the country and have things go terribly wrong on their airplane  thanks to OsCorp, naturally.

Its the juxtaposition between these scenes that showcases the core issue of the film  when left to the devices of being a pure Spider-Man movie, its pure enjoyment and excitement  but the film tosses away all goodwill by tying in the big Parker/Oscorp conspiracy that is  for some reason  becoming the focus of this series.

One of the elements which Ive always loved about the world of Spider-Man is how anyone can become anything, by chance. Peter was randomly bit by a spider, and goes from social outcast to hero (or menace, depending on your perspective). Scientists, reporters, movie effects operators, your friends dad  they can all go wrong and become your worst enemy.

Instead here, everything  and I mean everything - is about OsCorp.

Take our villains, for example. Jamie Foxxs Max Dillion, brought to us by way of Jim Carreys version of Edward Nigma in Batman Forever, works for OsCorp, is screwed over by OsCorp (specifically by yet another classic Spider-Man villain, in name at least), falls into a vat of OsCorp electric eels, and becomes the electrifying Electro.  And its pretty obvious that Harry Osborn  played by Dane DeHaan, who brings the same creepy greatness that made him perfect in Chronicle - has to come from the OsCorp cloth, so Im not going rest any blame there.

Instead, Im left with many questions  Why is Norman Osborn in literally one scene? Why is OsCorp run by so many evil white dudes? And most importantly  why does OsCorp need to be the cause of every single villain in Peters life?

It is a terribly kept secret that this movie is designed to set into motion a Spider-Man Movie Universe, which is set to include a third and fourth Amazing Spider-Man, and bafflingly enough, solo films for Venom and the super villain team-up crew known as the Sinister Six. If this film is any indication, however, the big plan is to expand the universe by way of having literally everything connected to one giant company  turning the ambition of a universe into a small-scale issue.  For as many people maligned Iron Man 2 for being the stepping stone for The Avengers, at least that gave us fantastic moments of Tony mouthing off to Nick Fury, or Captain Americas shield serving as a paperweight.  In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, world building is done in tepid boardroom meetings and through an over-reaching conspiracy that Peter Parker never needed.  Yes, the secret history of Richard and Mary Parker has always been an element of the Spider-Man mythos, but here, it removes the everyman side of the character. And besides, didn't we show enough disinterest in this untold story last time that they cut out most of these elements from the first film?

I wouldnt be so frustrated if the movie didn't also get so many things right. As previously mentioned, the action sequences are incredible, and I really cant get enough of Peters interactions with the women in his life. Sally Field continues to be a great Aunt May, and Emma Stone simply is Gwen Stacy. Shes a hardheaded, self-actualized part of Peters life, no shrieking violet, no damsel in distress. And when the film gives Gwen and Peter some true difficulties to deal with, Garfield and Stone shine bright. Its just incredibly disappointing how hard The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is brought down by its corporate ambitions.

I realize  you're reading this and applying context. I must be some giant fanboy. And yes, Ill admit that Spider-Man is hands-down my favorite fictional character, period. But if anything  that should make me more inclined to love this film. That said, I didn't hate it  I just found myself incredibly disappointed with how it turned out.  For every positive step forward with frantic, jaw-dropping Spider-Man action or the indelible chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 took two steps back with the massive OsCorp conspiracy.

At an overlong, bloated 142 minutes, the movie simply falters under its own weight. It pains me to say, but there was an old saying that came to mind  What do you get when you mix 5 pounds of Ice Cream with 5 pounds of manure? 10 pounds of manure.  The Summer 2014 movie season has not started on the right foot. Better luck next time, guys.",1400803200,48,5807,4.828282828282828

(It looks like he's following Hitchcock's eventual pattern of placing himself early, so movie-goers would find him, get it over with, and go back to watching what the movie was really about.)

But, more than ever, I found Peter Parker shallow and self-involved when he wasn't moping like a fourteen year old. Mucking up his alleged girlfriend's chances at Oxford? Who'd do that? The comic-book science munged reality worse than ever, the sequel-bait came across as blatant, and the bad guy seemed perfunctory more than anything else.

They needed to introduce the sinister six somehow, and they did it very well. Rhino's part in the movie is VERY short, but I like that because it just makes you even more excited for the next movie. Even though the way they plopped him in there wasn't the best, I am not too disappointed.  Harry Osborn's development (though many may disagree) was well played, he was mad at spider-man for saving other people's lives, yes refuses to save his. Little did he know, that if spider-man agreed to try and save him it would kill him; so when he found out that his best friend was spider-man, and how his best friend refused to try and 'save his life', he was outraged that his best friend 'betrayed him', and therefore wanted revenge. I do agree that it seemed a bit messy the first time I watched it, the second time I watched it, I absolutely loved it.

Gwen and Peter's relationship was very, very, very well played. It seemed so real.

Major spoiler coming up

Gwen's death was totally unexpected, I was in total shock, they played it off very well and his reaction looked genuine. It looked like he was going to catch her at the last moment , but he was just too late.

Spoiler over

The music was fantastic, I love how Electro's theme also coincided with his thoughts. Some disagree, but it just brought me into his world and it worked perfectly with the situation. The music throughout the entire movie was absolutely amazing. I don't understand why so many people don't like it.

The dialog in this movie (especially between Peter and Gwen) was awesome. It had some great lines, and I was laughing throughout the movie.

All in all, this movie was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1400284800,7,1802,4.523076923076923
6129512,4,B00H2FPY20,"When it comes to the reimagining of a previous iteration of a beloved movie, the initial reaction is the desire to compare, contrast, and the pass judgment on the quality of the remake against the previous version.  This is especially true when the remake is released not too many years after the original.  Hollywood seems to be doing a lot of reimagining lately; and in some cases this reimaging takes place within a couple of years of the original. There is the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (loved it), Let Me In (loved it), Man of Steel (liked it), The Punisher (hated it) and so many more. Are these new movies necessary? I think it depends on the type of movie, and if there is an appetite for it.  And based upon the critical reception and economic fortunes of these movies, people don't seem to mind too much. I did mind that someone thought that is was a good idea to reboot The Punisher though. I just want to put that out there.

I am happy that Sony thought it was a good idea to reboot the Spiderman series.  I was surprised that the movie studio had decided to reboot the series just three years after Sam Raimi had completed work on the previous Spiderman series(I can only describe it as mediocre), but happy nonetheless.  The main reason for my elation is the ever increasing pace of technological advancement.  Technological advancement has given the filmmaker the means to create a superhero movie that can satiate the needs of the most critical comic book fan boys; and wow a general audience. I am not lying when say that I saw many mouths agape during a 3D screening of the first Amazing Spiderman film in 2012.

For those of you who cannot stop extolling the wonderfulness of Sam Raimi's Spiderman films and think it necessary to trash the Amazing Spiderman 2, I say this: keep an open mind. Because of the technology that was used to create the action scenes in the Amazing Spiderman 2, Sam Rami's Spiderman movies look somewhat outdated; Andrew Garfield is a much better Peter Parker and Spiderman than Tobey McGuire.  Garfield fully inhabits the physical and emotional character of Peter Parker while Tobey McGuire plays a version of his character in the movie Pleasantville; and Emma Stone's performance as Peter Parker's love interest complete blows Kirsten Dunst's performance as Mary Jane out of the water. But Raimi's Spiderman movies are much better stories than the Amazing Spiderman movies; and an insufficient storyline is the main problem with Marc Webb's Amazing Spiderman 2.

The Amazing Spiderman is two and one half hours long, but I couldn't help but feel as if the storylines for all of the major players in this movie were rushed.  Electro (played by Jamie Fox), The Green Goblin (Dane Dehann), and the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) each have an origin story in this movie, and all of them are revealed at a breakneck pace, especially in the case of Jaime Fox.  I do like Jaime's portrayal of Electro in this film; however, his metamorphosis from geeky engineer to bad ass super villain seems to take place within a ten minute span, and is eerily reminiscent of Jim Carry's transformation from nerdy admirer of Batman to the Riddler in Batman Forever.  And after ten years of estrangement and the death of a father, Harry Osborne and Peter Parker reunite and become friends again in the next scene?  It's all too rushed and choppy.

And why do all of the villains of the Amazing Spiderman 2 have to have an origin story?  In each of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, the Dark Knight is confronted by more than one villain; however the director does not feel the need to flesh out all of their backstories.  The Joker, Bane, and the Scarecrow are already established villains at the time of their introductions in their respective films, and by spending less time on their origin stories the film makers are able to devote more of their time on essential aspects of the movie that help to tell the story. Perhaps The Amazing Spiderman's creators should have looked to Nolan for inspiration?

There is rampant speculation that the producers at Sony are formulating a plan to release a Sinister Six movie.  After the success of the Avengers movie-the current gold standard for the multi-superhero/villain film- I don't begrudge them for it.  However, there is no guarantee that this Sinister Six film will be a good movie.  And if I were the creators of these Spiderman movies, I would be careful.  Everyone remembers The Batman and Robin movie that Joel Schumacher made in 1997; the one with George Clooney wearing the Batman nipple suit that nearly ruined the entire Batman franchise.

With all of that said, I think that The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a good time at the movies.  That scene where Spiderman is flying through the skies of New York City, while his Spiderman suit ripples in the wind is so exhilarating.  This movie-like many of the other superhero movies that are being made today-is sort of a miracle. The fact that movie makers are able to create a credible movie about an alternate world, where a young man or woman is so otherworldly in his/her talent is pretty amazing.  So watch the Amazing Spiderman 2.  You won't fall asleep during the film and the kids will love it too.",1400284800,10,5225,4.713186813186813
6129513,2,B00H2FPY20,"I loved the the first film in this series, and repeatedly watched it. I may watch part 2 one more time along the way but I have no great desire to do so. The villains horribly flop in that the costumes that give them uniqueness and identifiability from the comics have been altered drastically.  Electro's face was gimmicky looking while his powers have been seen time and again in any film that uses electricity as a sci fi  focal point. How did he end up with a costume with little lightening bolts on the arms? The Green Goblin who's name I never heard uttered ( but could have missed) had a non threatening look. A real goblin mask would have added to the character. His glider was straight out of the prior Spider-Man films as  well. Is the Rhino worth mentioning?. I understand the"" machine"" angle but it didn't work. And, we're left hanging with a half engaged battle.

Dialogue and character building are great, in a good film, and this film wasn't good because it completely overkilled with long monotonous explanations and trumped up emotional responses from most of the characters. Garfield , although good at times, seemed off in many scenes and just boring. The action sequences were far apart from one another to the point where the film played out like a drama that didn't seem to have,a place for such outlandishness when it occurred. The film had a very negative vibe to it and the connective reasons as to why things appear or need to be seemed rushed.  Areas that needed true explanation got none.

I also felt like I could distantly hear the director yelling, ""cut""  when Spidey was in perilous scenes. The character of Spider-Man just came off as ultra silly . Seeing a big spider logo in the beginning being stamped onto the film was cheesy and with the accompanying music was more befitting of Superman moment than Spider-Man. I was shocked at my own disappointment in the film. Even Spidys graceful web slinging flights through NYC seemed overly animated. Emma Stone's interesting quirks and cuteness was all that I saw redeemable . The kids will initially  love it, but you might catch them snoring in half hour intervals .

No other Marvel movie, no matter how good, accomplishes that.

It could have used more time in the oven, but this is a good film, and the action is absolutely brilliant in some scenes. Maybe because the bar was set so high with Spiderman 2, that fans are saying this is not as good. But, it takes a while to build up to that level of good.

6129518,3,B00H2FPY20,"In the sequel to Amazing Spider-man, Peter Parker struggles with keeping his promises to Captain Stacy to keep Gwen out of the dangers entailed in being Spider-man as he continues to be in love with her. At the same time, Spider-man faces new threats with the creation of Electro, and then Harry Osborn ascends to Oscorp believing that only the blood of Spider-man can cure him of the degenerative disease he inherited from his father.

Plus side:

The biggest plus of this movie that makes it work is Andrew Garfield. Garfield portrays the best and most likable Spider-man ever. He's still human, flawed, and struggling, but he's not near as whiny as previous versions.

Spider-man has grown from the brooding teenager to a compassionate and caring hero. The scenes with kids are priceless. Spidey can take on threats and kick tail and take names but that's not the first resort. His efforts to talk down Electro and Green Goblin are great. Peter Parker has some great moments with Aunt May and Gwen Stacy. You never get a feeling that Spidey or Peter's being a jerk.

I also have to applaud the way Spidey's webslinging was portrayed. He's never more graceful and being Spider-man never looked more fun than in this movie.

I think that Garfield could be to Spider-man what Christopher Reeves was to Superman in the 1970s or what David Tennant was to the new Doctor Who.

Emma Stone was also great as Gwen Stacy and Dante DeHaan turned in a muli-faceted performance as Harry Osborn.

Negatives

This is a case where great actors were betrayed by a mediocre and often undisciplined script. Director Marc Webb cut two scenes featuring Shailene Woodsley as Mary Jane Watson in order to make the film more focused. I don't fault him for that. The problem was that Webb didn't go far enough to produce a film that could be focused. The movie actually begins with long flashback scene featuring Peter's dead father Richard Parker fighting a bad guy to to ensure his file is uploaded. Yes, we have the most expensive Uploading a File Scene in history.

We also have scenes that go nowhere. When Max Dillon is turned into Electro as a result of an Oscorp accident, Gwen, who works for Oscorp, becomes suspicious and searches the company directory and finds she's not there which arouses suspicion and she's chased by Oscorp security. She tells this to Peter and theorizes that Electro is Dillon and that Oscorp is covering it up and our heroes do nothing about it and once Ms. Stacy leaves the building , the villains don't seem to care about it either.

The biggest offenses has to do with the two villains. It's not just that the movie has both Electro and Green Goblin, it's how it handled both villains. Electro can be an awesome threat in the comics and could be a great movie villain, but here the character isn't really given a chance to shine. He has one battle with Spidey and is then locked up for most of the film and then has a second battle with Spidey. Both are too short.

The Green Goblin has historically been Spider-man's most destructive foe, one who battled him to the point of death multiple times. In the movie, Harry Osborn stumbles upon Goblin equipment in a place he's been led to for something else and so in a matter of minutes, grabs the suit and glider and flies to battle Spider-man. that makes the battle with Venom in Spider-man 3 look well-designed.

The film also features a key death and this person was helping Spidey fight Electro and after Electro was dealt with, this newly powered Goblin shows up and causes the death in an utterly cheap scene.

With a lesser actor, this movie was absolutely reak, but Andrew Garfield is a joy to watch as Spider-man even though the script is a deadlier foe than either the Green Goblin or Electro.

The movie ends on a cliffhanger and hints of a Sinister Six film. It's a prospect I have mixed feelings on. On the one hand, Spidey v. the Sinister Six is the type of classic battle that can be awesome if done right. However, If Webb bad this much trouble managing a film with two villains, how is he going to do with six?",1399852800,32,4090,4.592592592592593

6129520,3,B00H2FPY20,"Let me just get this off my chest before I get too far in...

Rail on Raimiverse Spidey 3 all you want, but it won't convince me that it was the disaster everyone makes it out to be. Does that mean it's great? No, it's still horribly weak and flawed, but at least it seemed to have a purpose, even if it was executed poorly. Amazing Spidey 2 didn't seem to have a purpose. It was more of a teenage soap opera than a superhero flick, focusing more on the personal issues that Gwen and Peter are going through instead of fleshing out both characters and telling a halfway decent story.

There were some good action scenes though. I particularly liked the battle(s) with Electro, though I didn't care much for him as a villain. Jamie Foxx does pretty well in his portrayal though.

Also, I'm not a fan of the re-imagined Harry Osborn / Goblin at all. Instead of coming off as an arrogant piehole, this version comes off as a whiny and annoying.brat. Franco pulled off Harry's smugness just perfectly in the Raimiverse movies. And, maybe it's just me, but I also find Garfield's Parker more of a wimp than Maguire's. Of course Maguire's Parker had his moments too, but, always seemed to redeem himself. Garfield's Parker has that too, but it only seems to pop up when someone pries it out of him.

Finally, the climax just drove me batty. Yeah, sad, but it seemed like such a cop out to me, so disappointing.

Concluding analysis is: It's an OK movie, but it's a one dimensional movie choosing relationship issues over actual character development. An assortment of weak and annoying villains that really add nothing to Peter's growth as a human being is just another unfavorable strike against this movie. For those dying to see it; wait for Netflix/Redbox you won't miss anything by skipping the theatre on this one.",1399852800,3,1814,4.603715170278638
6129521,4,B00H2FPY20,"People will agree to disagree or disagree to disagree which is the best Spider Man movie. I will always think of the original Spider Man 2 movie directed by Sam Raimi as the best, Spider Man 3 was a franchise killer necessitating a franchise reboot.

Yet Amazing Spidey 2 has several memorable moments, and I think delivers the most shocking and unexpected moment you are likely to see in any Spider Man movie, or perhaps any movie you will see this year, which while it shocked me at the time, in hindsight I applaud as courageous storytelling.

Spider Man's lives in a mutant driven world, where someone always seems a careless slip away from becoming a mutant or being killed by one. In this case, a weird electric geek gets a little careless above a pool of electric eels, while Harry Osborne seeks the cure for a fatal inherited disease with a blood sample from our web slinging hero.

Meanwhile things get complicated between Spidey and Gwen. It's hard being a superhero balancing your superhero life with your romantic life, when a mutant emergency can call you away at a moment's notice. But our Spidey will always have these dilemmas. If only he did not date someone quite so intelligent, who may be able to get a scholarship to Oxford. Meanwhile, the mystery of what happened to Spidey's own parents continues to trouble him, and why were his fathers studies so dangerous that he had to disappear at a moment's notice leaving little pre Spidey to grow up without a father and troubled by abandonment issues. You will discover the answers to these mysteries when you watch the movie.

If Spidey wanted to give it all up for love, would the mutants give up terrorizing New York City. Not for a New York minute. You see the difficulty, the work of a superhero never ends. Just when you think you're out, they pull you back in. And when your friends become mutants, with the added risk of suspecting or even guessing your identity, that can put you and your girlfriend Gwen in a whole stew of trouble. These dilemmas preoccupy our web slinging friend. And what do you when your girlfriend has had enough, and tells you to sling it.

And some people think you are more of a nuisance than a hero, unless there's a crisis, and then who do they want. People can be so fickle about their superheroes. And when one crisis is contained another emerges. Such are the vicissitudes of a superheroes life.

You see Spidey alone of all the mutants uses his new abilities for good, while others are simply insane, or have an agenda that brings them into direct confrontation with Spider Man. No one can doubt Spidey's courage or determination, but even a superhero has his limits.

I enjoyed the performances in the movie, particularly Emma Stone as Gwen. I don't know if I have her enthusiasm for Andrew Garfield who she proclaims the best actor on the planet. She might be a little biased. I found Electro was an interesting villain, and I could even see how he might defeat Spidey, but in the end what I will remember most is that surprising moment which seemed to go on forever. At one point I had a slight sense of vertigo as Spidey plunged from a tall building.

If you're like me you may discover love is harder than you think, relationships are hard, they take work, sometimes love isn't enough and that it's dangerous to think you can contain a mutant menace, and you never know the next place a mutant is going to morph out of.

My one beef with Spidey as with many Marvel movies is the essentially cookie cutter approach to the story, with the obligatory story arc with extended action and special effects which for me can get a little formulaic, although I have to admitIron Man 2 was amazing, in this case the wit and charm of Robert Downey ttanscends the other elements.

I cannot guarantee you will like this more than other Spidey movies but I do think they are all better than that nadir Spider Man 3, which almost made me give up watching Spidey movies entirely. It's difficult to know where the Spidey franchise goes from here. Maybe this time the third time will be a charm instead of a jinx.

I feel appreciative enough of Amazing Spidey 2 to undoubtedly go see Spidey 3 with some optimism, a triumph of hope over experience. We shall see..",1399766400,7,4254,4.562254259501966

6129523,1,B00H2FPY20,"You will like this if all you want are special effects and battle scenes which are spectacular in the last third of the movie.  Jamie Fox was wonderful as Electro once he gets the powers but before that he was painful to watch (think Meteor Man without the comedy).  Emma Stone was charming, smart and gorgeous as usual.  Unfortunately you will have to put up with the first 2/3 and last 10 minutes of the movie for that sweet spot.  Other than that you will get the full emotional roller coaster that is Peter Parker/Spider Man which can appear very bi-polar (unreasonable/irresponsible highs and crushing lows); a terribly predictable story; the tragic death of a beloved character while many police and bystanders inexplicably avoid death or injury when they most certainly should have (building debris and heavy machine gun fire fail to injure anyone despite huge crowds lining up to watch the battles like it's a Macy's Day parade).

As a youthful fan/collector of comic books and an enthusiastic adult watcher of superhero movies I was shocked and revolted by the first battle that took place in this movie as I saw Spiderman make a bunch of smart ass comments and basically screwing around while the villains crushed police and civilian vehicles and shot indiscriminately in every direction.  It's true that traditionally Spiderman does have a comedic tone during battle but never at the expense of innocents as this movie depicts.

For those of you who have seen the trailers some of those scenes are no longer in the theatrical version (the elder Osborne having Peter watched for example).",1399680000,15,1598,4.9182156133829
6129524,3,B00H2FPY20,"I was quite taken back at how this sequel differed greatly from Marc Webb's first Amazing Spider-Man movie. I really loved that particular film because it was a very much more grounded & grittier approach that we really hadn't seen with the Sam Raimi movies & I'm not saying ones better than the other since the Raimi & Maguire trilogy is a totally different beast than what Marc Webb's doing, & I'm all for escapism. We've gotten so caught up in a post Nolan superhero movie genre where everything now has to be pure realism or nothing that we've forgotten that sense of fun & fantasy. Raimi's Spider-Man 2 & Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man are in my opinion the best of the Spidey cinematic series, but I digress. This follow up to the 2012 film is a mixed bag with an apparent desire to have a bit more fun in the way of campy villains & easter eggs. Besides the top notch special effects & live action that's present in all the Spidey movies, Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Electro truly seems like he's right out of the Joel Schumacher's Batman flicks as does the hammy German doctor at Ravencroft Institute. That really left me scratching my head. Was I back in 1995?? Actually I was quite surprised that Electro didn't have a much bigger role in the movie as he was heavily being promoted as the new baddie. I did like the fact that the film really centered on Garfield's Peter Parker more than anything else without getting itself sidetracked with the bad guys or the brief trivial cameos by characters from the Spider-Man comics (eg; Alistair Smythe, Felicia Hardy, J. Jonah Jameson, etc.). Rhys Ifans' Lizard was a much more compelling antagonist & just seemed much more successfully realized while Jamie Foxx's brief scenes don't seem to really add up to anything important besides some eye candy. Dane Dehaan really shine's here as the new movie interpretation of wealthy heir Harry Osbourne. He also successfully brings to life a menacing & vile Green Goblin that's much more appropriate than the Willem Dafoe version ever was. Amazing Spider-Man 2 also successfully ties up some loose ends in regards to his parents disappearance from the first film & while I don't wish to give too much away, Sally Field continues to be perfect as Aunt May & her scenes with Andrew are spectacular as is Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. With a powerful & haunting finale to this movie I still felt somewhat short changed since SEVERAL scenes & dialogue that were present in ALL of the various trailers & TV spots are COMPLETELY ABSENT from the theatrical cut. That annoyed me the most because if you've been following the production of this movie since day one, you will certainly notice a lot of scenes just gone from what you had been seeing for almost a year. That sort of changes your perception of the movie after you've finished watching it & to that end the film comes across as incomplete. Yet I have faith the third film will get back on a more focused track but perhaps a directors cut in the meantime Sony? Though I will give credit where credit is rightly due. Andrew Garfield nails Peter Parker physically with his skinny & lean athletic build & look's every bit as Spidey like he was lifted right off the comic panels. The Spider-Man costume in this movie is also true perfection & that's something that's very rare in superhero cinema.",1399593600,6,3334,4.6525423728813555
6129525,4,B00H2FPY20,"Despite it not receiving the kindest critical reviews during its initial release, I was a huge fan of 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". A brand new re-imagining of the popular comic book story, it had surprisingly great performances and amounted to one of the most entertaining films of that year. And after being so keen on the first movie I was extremely excited to hear that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was finally going to hit theaters. It may not have lived up to my immense expectations but notwithstanding its many flaws, I really enjoyed it.

 We pick up our story with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he struggles to balance his relationship with Gwen (Emma Stone) along with his responsibility as Spider-Man.  With fresh villains emerging, including an uber-cheesy Jamie Foxx as Electro and a creepy Green Goblin, he is forced to choose between his own problems and the dangers that face the city. On a much bigger scale than its predecessor, and wildly more lively, it's more of a crowd-pleaser than anything else.

 It has various issues concerning the antagonists, but the strongest points lie in the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, who provide the most heartwarming and endearing scenes. I realize the film may not be for everyone, but I found to be charming and amusing amidst its problems. Rated PG-13 for action, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is fun but flawed.",1399593600,5,1393,4.935897435897436
6129526,4,B00H2FPY20,"Its been days since I saw The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I've felt a nagging to go see it again. I haven't had that much fun with a summer blockbuster movie in a long time. I grew up on Raimi's Spider-Man movies, so when the first Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, I wasn't very happy with it. It retread old ground, had a weak villain, and just wasn't much fun. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a huge improvement, taking the groundwork of the first film and taking it in an exciting new direction that differs from Raimi's Spiderman. And as much sentimental value as Maguire's Peter Parker has for me, Garfield, objectively speaking, does a better job with the role. Its odd to watch something you love be surpassed and outdone. Other than Spider-Man 2, this is the best movie in the franchise to date. It has a lot of flaws, namely that its just a bit overstuffed; there's too many plot threads and characters that the movie is trying to develop and resolve. There's also some abrupt tonal shifts, but all of the individual scenes are executed well, and the movie just has this infectious, giddy sense of fun about it. I found it to be such a pleasant movie-going experience that its problems really didn't bug me. Nowadays, superhero movies have the misfortune of being compared to Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, which are excellent films, but are on a different level of film-making entirely. They are the superhero films from the skeptical adult's perspective; examining the very idea of the superhero and making an argument for superheroes being a bad thing and making matters worse. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the superhero movie you would have wanted to see as a kid. Its amusingly campy and ridiculous (Jamie Fox's Electro is so over the top its hilarious), the action scenes are exhilarating, and the drama is solid, considering what it could have been in a movie such as this.  If you can take it for what it is, its a blast. If you're looking for The Dark Knight, then steer clear of it; it doesn't reinvent the wheel. I for one, as a fan of Spider-Man, found it to be a perfect way to kick off the summer movie season.",1399593600,8,2126,4.550913838120104
6129527,2,B00H2FPY20,"Marc Webb's AMAZING SPIDER-MAN films thus far have depended upon eye-blistering spectacle and the charm of its two leads together. I don't want to turn this into another Raimi vs Webb tirade, but the thing that Raimi's first two SPIDER-MAN films got right was that storytelling is important, but even more important is allowing a plot to grow from the characters and not the other way around. Everyone knows that Raimi's third entry is a huge mess, but the less said about that, the better. He and the writers of those films, though, did know how to condense time and expand the universe more efficiently as well. In the first film, Peter goes from high school student to collegian in about an hour, and we also get a larger world with his introduction to The Daily Bugle as well as Oscorp.

Okay, enough. I could go on and on. But let's get back to this mess. This film is, more than anything, an exercise on showcasing state-of-the-art CG effects as well as the opportunity to expand the Spider-verse since we already know that Sony/Columbia intends to create a film around the character of Venom as well as a Sinister Six film that will feature other villains such as The Vulture, a new Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter and more hinted at throughout this film. Unfortunately, this film doesn't seem to learn anything from its predecessor. Again, a lot of the action takes place at night, and gives the film too dark an aesthetic for a Spider-Man film. He's a colorful, quippy guy and more opportunity should be given to show him bathed in light. No matter how dark the content was in MAN OF STEEL, at least Zack Snyder rarely showed Superman in darkness.

Everyone really knows the plot of this film already, but I want to concentrate on the characters in the film. Easily the best work in the film goes to Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, despite the fact that he already played this role in CHRONICLE, but since he was so great in that, it would stand to reason that him playing a young man feeling marginalized or ignored by his friend who suddenly gets more power than he should is right in his wheelhouse. Jamie Foxx... he's rarely ever good, and while he was fine in DJANGO UNCHAINED, and the idea that Max Dillon is more of a Rupert Pupkin deranged-fan character was an interesting tack taken by mega-hit writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (some of the TRANSFORMERS films, the rebooted STAR TREK films). However, Foxx plays him with no urgency and an almost campy take on a comic-book villain, speaking in hushed stage-whispery tones that suggest that Foxx knows he's playing a comic-book villain and wants to talk like one, but in real life. The best actors in the film, though, are the most marginalized. Sally Field as Aunt May, Paul Giamatti as The Rhino, and Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn all have far too little to do. As an on-screen couple, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are adorable. They have the right chemistry and the right energy, particularly for this type of film, but their roles are sadly either underwritten (Stone) or overwritten (Garfield). Seriously, to have Gwen Stacy giving her high-school graduation speech, talking about how short life is... that's just FAR too much foreshadowing. And Peter Parker, well, he's just a HUGE jerk.

The lesson that Peter was SUPPOSED to learn is with great power comes great responsibility. This film displays that with great power comes just being great. Peter LOVES being Spider-Man in this film. It's a real thrill for him. And as much as I can admire people trying to do things a bit differently with a character, Peter is just way too happy being Spider-Man. Responsibility is a BURDEN, not a kid with a new toy. He actually shirks away from responsibility every chance he gets and then gets away with a lot of it because Spider-Man is cool. He's a jerk to his grieving aunt, he's a jerk to his ailing best friend, he's a jerk to everyone. But the film's plot allows enough contrivances that he can walk away not being a jerk, because Spider-Man is supposed to be cool.

Here's the problem: While Spider-Man IS cool, Peter Parker is NOT. Peter is awkward, geeky, put upon, and in a constant spiral of not getting what he wants even if he might deserve it. He's broke. He comes from a home that's not taking in enough money. His jobs are low-paying and it puts even more pressure on him. He knows that he has to help people, but he also knows that helping those other people might prevent him from helping himself. This is something that the the Raimi films understood INCREDIBLY well, but these films do not. In the first film, I thought that some of Peter's decisions could have been jerky due to his teen angst. In this film, though, he seems angst-free. He's defied the dying wishes of a man that was a true hero so that he could be with his true love, and that costs him. But that never really seems to come back up on him, other than through a passage-of-time montage. It reinforces the idea that nothing in this world is EARNED, not even the consequences of death. People make fun of Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter as a huge cry-baby, but very little noise is made about Garfield SHOULD be crying but is too busy being a jerk.

THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 leaves you feeling like you should be sad, because what happens in the film is tragic, but it only seems to happen because it happened in the comics, and therefore doesn't stick the landing (no pun intended). I know that might seem like a hypocritical statement since I've just lamented how much stuff that's in the comics isn't present here at all, but this major event that happens in this film really only happens because Spider-Man fans know it's supposed to happen and not because it SHOULD happen. I will NOT be seeing the third film, mostly because I have no faith that Webb, Garfield and Orci/Kurtzman can construct a good Spider-Man film. However, I will be in line to see the SINISTER SIX film. Why? Because Drew Goddard, that's why.",1399507200,10,5994,4.619136960600375
6129528,2,B00H2FPY20,"This was the most boring superhero movie I think I have ever seen. I would venture to estimate 80% of the movie was soap opera-esque drama. Electro was played out to be a huge part of this movie yet there are two scenes he is actually featured in, the last one being the only significant one...which just happened to be the only action packed 30 minutes of the movie not interrupted with some mundane and poorly written drama scene. It actually reminded me a lot of a Twilight movie, but at least Twilight is not under the guise of an action film. And it is amazing that despite Peter Parker going through all of this drama he can still crack stupid jokes while fighting bad guys. The corny jokes were pretty bad this time around, most not worth even a chuckle. The film tries to be darker like the latest Batman series, yet still continues attempts at poorly placed humor that just is not funny.

I actually enjoyed the first one and the darker side it took from the cheesy first Spider man films, but this one was just bad. I could not wait for it to end. The only thing that kept me from kicking a puppy on the way out of the theater was the final action scenes with Electro, though the stupid Rhino scene at the end almost blew it for the whole thing.

6129530,4,B00H2FPY20,"After a brief interlude set in the past, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 starts off with a bang, featuring our hero Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) chasing down a Russian named Aleksei (Paul Giamatti) involved in a heist. He happens to save the life of an engineer at OsCorp, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), while bringing down his quarry. Peter's been at the hero game for awhile, working as a photographer, dealing with a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and feeling guilty over the death of her father (Denis Leary), what with the police captain showing up in visions warning him to stay away from Gwen.

As is usually the case in these matters, fate steps in as a childhood friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to Manhattan to visit his dying father Norman (Chris Cooper). With the passing of the old man, Harry takes on the mantle of the company and quickly starts showing us an unpleasant side (it's an Osborn thing). Max, meanwhile, goes from socially awkward to something else entirely in an accident involving electric eels and ends up a powerhouse generating his own electricity. Thus sets the stage for Peter to swing into action, with lives at stake, more than one villain to tangle with, and his very blood being sought after. So, another day in the life of Peter Parker.

Director Marc Webb returns from the first film, bringing along a committee of four writers for the story, which at times feels like it's setting up the stage for the next movie (this happens, of course, when you're dealing with a franchise). Nonetheless, they turn back to the comics for inspiration, and that's a good source. Perhaps even more than Peter's driving motto ""with great power comes great responsibility"" is the character's sense of guilt. It starts with the death of his uncle, a death he could have prevented, the motivating factor for the rest of his life. The writers play that out in how Peter relates to his aunt May (Sally Field), and in the guilt he feels over the death of Captain Stacy, whose apparition lingers about like the ghost of Hamlet's father. They also take the dynamics of Peter's relationship with Gwen, and the friendship with Harry, from the comics, moving things in different directions. It's a bit convoluted at times- and I say that as a comics fan. The better moments of the film are not those sweeping special effect sequences, but the personal and the human.

The special effects crews do well with their work. Where physical filming leaves off, they seamlessly weave in CGI as needed, and the combined effect does well, as it did in the first film, of giving us a wall crawler swinging his way through the streets of New York. More importantly, the way the new villains are rendered works. The primary villain in all of this is Electro, looking different from his comic book origins. The way he uses electricity is dynamic, and the special effects team render that well, giving him a look that's spooky. The crew also do much the same for the encore appearance of Aleksei, sporting a techno-armour that might make Iron Man think twice. Where the appearance of the Rhino in the comics just wouldn't work in the movies, rendering the character operating essentially a lumbering tank is a more inspired choice. And we get a Green Goblin out of the mix, with a character design that's more fitting and deranged than the two Goblins of the Sam Raimi trilogy.

The cast is well suited to their roles. Sally Field returns as Aunt May, still younger than the ancient crone in the comics (letters of outrage can be sent to my idiot ex-brother-in-law). She's in mourning of course, and worries about her nephew, continuing to play the role with understated strength, wisdom, and patience. Cooper, one of my favourite actors, is a surprise in only making a brief appearance as Norman Osborn. Instead of playing the role as flat out crazy as Willem Dafoe did in the first Raimi film, he goes for reserved as a dying man, while hiding many secrets that will come out as time goes along. Colm Feore turns up as well. He's one of those character actors you've seen in countless films and series, and he plays an OsCorp executive here, with the gravity you'd expect from the actor. Marton Csokas, another character actor who appeared in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, turns up playing a director of a high-security mental hospital.

The trio of villains bring different strengths to their roles. Paul Giamatti is a terrific character actor whose turn here is brief, but book ends the start and end of the film. When we first meet him as Aleksei, he's a temper tantrum having a bad day when a heist goes wrong, something that we might expect out of the character as we know him from the comics. Giamatti can certainly convey anger and rage, and he does that in spades here, and at the end of the film when we see him in armour as an unexpected Rhino. DeHaan was new to me in this film. He plays Harry Osborn in different ways, which fits the character's history. There's a tormented side to him with a difficult history with his father. He seems most like himself when he meets Peter again and they're just relating to each other as friends. But he takes a different path, and DeHaan must convey his descent into darkness in a way that makes sense. He does so, and I'd like to see more out of him. Foxx is perhaps the biggest surprise among the new players. This is an actor who has hits and misses in his resume, but when he's good, he's very good. Performances in Ray or The Kingdom have established his credentials and his range. He starts out Max as a social misfit- smart enough to be an engineer, but oblivious and awkward in other ways. The accident that transforms him also unhinges him, and Foxx conveys that aspect well. The comics version of Electro has always been a formidable enemy, one that Peter had to use his mind to bring down. Foxx takes the character in some different directions, but brings across just how dangerous Electro can be in his performance.

The two leads are still in fine form as they were in the first film. Emma Stone plays Gwen they way the story writes her- smart, confident, assured. She's a young woman with her future ahead of her, who knows what she wants out of life, and can be resourceful and ingenious at times. And she also brings across the playful, caring side of the character. Her chemistry with Garfield feels real. Andrew Garfield continues to play the character of Peter as something of an outsider with a rebellious streak, a wise cracker who uses the sarcasm as a kind of mask. He tries to find balance in life between the thrills that his powers allow, and the responsibility that those powers have placed upon him. He copes with guilt over the past, struggles to find answers to questions he has about himself and others.",1399507200,3,6794,4.6387043189368775
6129531,4,B00H2FPY20,"When the first Amazing Spiderman came out with Andrew Garfield in the title role, I didn't go see it. I waited for the DVD so I could see it at home.
Quite frankly, it was extremely forgettable for a debut showing reboot of a much beloved franchise. I had a different feeling about this one, call it spidey sense, but I knew I would not have to endure another blossoming report of how it all began, once again, as I am overly exhausted at superhero origins movies, something the Hollywood nerds are overly stuck on, but at least they get on with it eventually.
And it was in 3D, a feature I am now absolutely hooked on
I could watch a two hour version of a non stop action superhero battle without any emotional set up or backdrop and be totally happy. I don't need to venture any further into the making of a criminal, or for that matter, the making of a superhero, just give me those spectacular superhero effects of which this movie has plenty of, the 3D Electro electrical scenes were brilliant.
Andrew Garfield himself is an amazing actor, and he does spidey as well as he fits in that suit. Emma Stone is an amazing actress and it's a pity what they did do her character as she was much more highly digestible than the Mary Jane character of previous because MJ was an emotional wreck having to deal with bitter home life and a failing career.

There's quite a bit of dislike from some people for The Amazing Spider-man movie franchise, and I don't really understand it, but I personally feel like this is the best Spider-man movie yet. It's sort of a romance story mixed with comic book movie goodness, but there's the drama of Peter not understanding his father's motives for leaving, and dealing with how he may help his friend Harry who is in an unfortunate situation. Maybe there are some flaws here and there, but overall a movie is meant to be enjoyed, and I certainly enjoy this one.",1399507200,19,711,4.5625

6129535,4,B00H2FPY20,"To me, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was quite better than the original. It had great action, fantastic visuals and special effects, decent humor and good character development. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy felt like a soap opera, whereas this has the right amount of drama that it feels even with the storyline. Not long after fighting The Lizard, it's time for Peter Parker and his fellow classmates to graduate. Peter still feels guilty about the death of Gwen's father.

Meanwhile, a nerdy maintenance man who works at OsCorp named Max Dillon falls into a tank of genetically modified electric eels and becomes able to control anything that runs on electricity. (Jamie Foxx made an 'electrifying' villain. He starts out really dorky and becomes awesomely tough by the end of the film)  Max idolizes Spider-Man, but when Max is labeled as a villain due to his appearance, the people of New York hate him and want Spider-Man to destroy him. Spider-Man must not only deal with Electro and a new Green Goblin, but must face the idea that he may never see Gwen again as she wants to go to school in England. This is the first summer blockbuster of 2014 in my opinion. I highly recommend THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2!!!",1399420800,4,1210,4.784688995215311
6129536,5,B00H2FPY20,I was very surprised at how emotional it was. It had my feelings all over the place. I love that they added more comedy to it. You'll find yourself laughing at almost every scene. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are amazing at making Gwen and Peter's relationship so real since they are actually dating in real life. The movie is all around amazing and I would for sure go see it again.,1399420800,5,385,4.361111111111111
6129537,4,B00H2FPY20,"I picked up my first Spider-Man comic book many decades ago now, so I have seen more incarnations of the Wall Crawler than I care to count-Todd McFarland's might be my favorite-not to mention reboots, relaunches and countless continuity tweaking.  And that's just in the comics; the movie versions are something else altogether.  I am a real fan of the Sam Raimi/Toby McGuire trilogy (didn't hate the third film, but didn't like it either), but I've grown very partial to the Sony reboot and their take on Spidey, finding a lot to like in this latest version.  THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN set things up with retelling of the origin story where nerdy Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes the title hero, falls in love with Gwen Stacy and battles The Lizard.

THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 picks up pretty much where the first movie left off, although they do take the time to fill in the back story of Peter's parents and just what his father was doing at Oscorp back in the day.  The second installment is divided between Peter's romance with Gwen, which is haunted by his promise to her late father to keep her safe from his life as Spider-Man, and his battles with three new villains.  A lot has been shoe horned into the second movie and I give director Marc Webb credit for not letting it turn into another BATMAN AND ROBIN and keeping the whole thing coherent.

I think the main reason for this is how well the movie gets the characters right: Peter Parker is clearly having a blast being Spider-Man and the way he gets off quips and cracks jokes as he battles criminals is very true to the way Stan Lee and Steve Ditko conceived the character way back in 1962.  In Gwen Stacy he has found the perfect match, both in courage and smarts, and their romance never turns sappy; we care about these kids because they will obviously be happy together; she knows his secret and he can trust her.  Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are terrific in their parts, creating wholly believable heroes.  I give a lot of credit to the film makers for having the guts to stay true to the original Gwen Stacy story line.

Then there is the villains; this is the most vital part of any super hero movie, because it just doesn't work if the antagonist is not the equal in strength and power to the hero.  In THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 they stay true to the great Marvel concept of having the bad guy be a flawed individual who often be the victim of a tragic twist of fate or their own bad choices.  That is certainly true of Max Dillon/Electro and Harry Osborn/The Green Goblin, as we get basically get a two in one movie origin story for both of them.  Max, played by Jamie Foxx, is a geeky technician at Oscorp, a pushed around nobody who develops a bad case of hero worship when Spider-Man saves him from being crushed by a car in the opening scene; later Max will fall into a vat of enhanced electric eels and gain the power to command electricity (not to mention turning blue).  In the blink of an eye, this powerless wimp becomes omnipotent and it drives him completely over the edge and into a murderous rage when his former idol appears to turn against him.  The scene where Foxx's Max gives himself a birthday party in his empty apartment is great character defining.

Harry Osborn, on the other hand, is the powerful CEO of Oscorp and Peter's former childhood best friend, but he is powerless against a fatally inherited genetic disease and desperate for a cure.  Harry thinks he's found one in Spider-Man's blood, but when Spidey says no to a donation because of the unknown risks, Harry turns to the research of Peter's father (which he enlists the help of Electro to obtain) and injects himself with mutated spider venom, transforming into the Green Goblin.  Feeling betrayed by Spider-Man and Peter, the Goblin sets out to get himself some payback.  Dane DeHann (who was in a decidedly different super hero movie, CHRONICLE)is superb as Harry; if we don't feel sympathy for him, at least we understand where he's coming from and knows he's not just another super villain who is evil just because he's evil.

The third villain is Aleksi Sytsevich, the Rhino, played by Paul Giamatti, who basically is in two scenes, but makes the most of them.  Sytsevich is a Russian thug who is causing mayhem in the streets if Manhattan in the film's opening and then returns later in a suit of battle armor.  It's implied that the Rhino will be back in later films, which is good news for us Giamatti fans.

The special effects and the battle scenes are everything they need to be in a super hero movie and the throw downs between Spidey and his foes are just what us fans expect: lots of stuff getting broken and lots things going boom.

There are lots of nods to the Marvel universe popping up here and there like the Ravenscroft Prison for the Criminally Insane, hints at future appearances by Doc Ock and the Vulture (perhaps in a projected Sinister Six film), Alistair Smythe and Felicia Hardy (The Black Cat) working at Oscorp.  Bit by bit we are getting the Spiderverse; which of course means a returning Sally Field as an Aunt May decidedly not as decrepit as the one in the comics (who somehow survived two dozen heart attacks over the years).

THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 has its faults, chief among them is a running time that is just too long by a half hour, and by my count has at least four climatic scenes before it is done.  They also do some tweaking with the characters that might not suit the fanboys. I really did not like it that we're done with Norman Osborn so quickly; in the comics, he is a pivotal villain and it would have been nice to have seen a great actor like Chris Cooper stick around for awhile.

But this second movie definitely left me wanting more: where's Flash Thompson?  They simply can't do another Spidey movie without J. Jonah Jameson and the Daily Bugle newsroom.  And what about Mary Jane Watson?  Shailene Woodley is set to play her and actually filmed a few scenes for ASM 2 that were cut.

Of course the bigger question is where will the Spider-Man franchise go in the future; ultimately I hope Marvel/Disney will get the rights to Spidey and the X-Men back from Sony and we'll have an Avengers movie that unites all of Marvels great super heroes.  And after that, could we dare hope for an Avengers vs JLA match up on the big screen?  Anything is possible.",1399420800,3,6395,4.526498696785404
6129538,4,B00H2FPY20,"Theatrical review.

I was somewhat mystified as to why Spider-Man had to be re-started back in 2010, but I admit I liked the movie for the fresh enthusiasm Andrew Garfield brought to Peter Parker's Spidie transformation.  I'm not one of those haters who criticized the Tobey Maguire/Kirsten Dunst chemistry, but I have to admit that Garfield and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy have something special.  The fact that they are off-screen romantic partners probably helps.  In fact, the best scenes in this movie are when they are together.  For me the banter and the development of their characters is essential in the story line, especially in the final act.

I was also taken with Sally Field as Peter's Aunt May who finally gives Peter some answers about his parent's disappearance years ago.  In fact we learn about those events in the excellent opening sequence, shown in flashback.  Director Marc Webb, perhaps best known for the fine romantic comedy ""(500) Days of Summer,"" seems to have a good handle on the many action sequences.  The traditional chase sequence follows the flashback and is pretty dumb.

This is where we meet one of the 3 villains, Rhino/Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who is making a run for it in an armored car after stealing some sort of radioactive material.  That is followed by villain number 2, Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) and finally Green Goblin/Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan).  To be sure the film has one too many bad guys that poor Spidie has to deal with.  It adds nothing to the current story other than an extra 30 minutes that I could have done without.  Action freaks would probably want to slash some of the more intimate moments in the mid-section.  Still there is plenty for everybody and provides for a good sequel in this series.",1399334400,4,1774,4.827814569536423
6129539,5,B00H2FPY20,"Only 3 days after this movie came out and all these reviews! wow. I've been a spidey fan ever since I picked up my first Ultimate Spiderman comic (my excuse to be reviewing the movie before it's out of the theatre) and I must say that The Amazing Spiderman Movies, the second one especially, capture something about the character, both as Peter Parker and as Spiderman, that the original trilogy did not. (by the way, everyone is calling them a 'reboot' like it's some kind of putdown, when they're so much better than the 'original' version, and follow the comic books much more closely). I loved everything about this movie, from the fresh backstory to the twisted villains to the epic battle scenes. the romance, also, went far beyond the usual comic-book dimension and actually got a chance to be fleshed out. Spiderman's quips are hilarious, as always, and the ending made me cry. a movie definitely worth watching more than once.

p.s. does anyone else think it's funny that the director is named Marc Webb?",1399248000,6,1013,4.755681818181818
6129540,5,B00H2FPY20,"I am sorry to say this but I only LIKED the 2nd of Spider-man Trilogy from years back.
The first and third were too cheesy and done in disdain.

The 2nd with Dr. Ock was the best, it was such an terrific superhero movie that we all
could get a feel for, I don't know why but it felt that way.

The reboot to ASM so far has done pretty well, but I hoped for more out of the first
two, I'll admit. I was hoping to see a bit of Mary Jane in the sequel but I know they
took her out before adding her to part 3.... with Dr. Ock next and maybe other villains.

I was a bit turned off with the Green Goblin though- but Electro and Rhino were pretty cool...
for this type of comic book era we all are IN right now.

well done, Mr. Webb! keep up the good work. I know you will do well on the next two if you
are signed up for those or so. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone had terrific chemistry
in both movies but it was sad to see Gwen Stacy die just like in the comics.

Special effects and storyline were great.... location outlooks and casting were great....
what's there to argue about?? :)",1399248000,11,1084,3.9315068493150687
6129541,5,B00H2FPY20,"First off, I don't get the complaining about this movie.  ""Not enough character development, bla bla bla..""  Guess what, if you want great character development, watch Shindlers List.  This is a comic book movie first and foremost.  The character has been developed for the past 50 years!

Don't get me wrong, the movie needs character development for the movie to be engaging, the story to flow, and to give the studio even more reason for the next half-dozen sequels, prequels, spin-offs, etc...  And there really is plenty of it.  We get a great view of what is going to push Peter in the future with the death of Gwen, and for most of the movie we had a solid development of Harry (until he just breaks down and goes full on bonkers!).  Jamie Foxx is reaching a bit as electro, but they did a far better job on his look than I would have thought.

HOWEVER.... As someone who loves having the blu-ray hard copy as well as a digital one, I HATE being saddled with a UltraViolet copy rather than a Digital Copy (iTunes Compatible), or at least being given the choice like many other movies do now.  UV never seems to work right for me.  And as an (ex) Apple Employee, I am a pretty knowledgable guy when it comes to technology.  And still I can't retrieve any of the UV movies I have purchased / redeemed to this day.

I would buy this combo in a second if they just got rid of the UV copy, and gave me either the choice of what I want, or just gave the Digital Copy that works for everyone, everytime!",1399248000,7,1503,4.325

6129543,5,B00H2FPY20,"In a few words: this movie had its work cut out for it. In 2.5 hours it needed to set the stage for a whole universe of planned future movies like Sinister Six, Venom, and Amazing Spider-man 3. It manages to do that well, establish two villains and their back stories, and come off as a more polished and fully realized movie than the first Amazing Spider-man (which was already leaps and bounds over the older movies). It even managed to make me care about the relationship and conflict between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker and that is no small feat for a big Hollywood production.

Worth your time. Is it perfect? That's a subjective question and we can all find our own minor flaws with most movies. Sony has this series headed in the right direction and they aren't shy about rebooting old canon -- and they seem to be fairly good at it. Keep up the good work, I'm anxious to see where it goes from here.",1399248000,10,907,4.366863905325443
6129544,5,B00H2FPY20,"I really have grown tired of the endless comparisons of the two series' of Spiderman, the 'Tobey Maguire' trilogy and the reboot Amazing Spiderman. In this age of cynicism and free technology, it seems that there is no pleasing everybody and the truth is; that's correct. The 'Tobey Maguire' trilogy had its qualities that peaked with the second installment and then lost its way despite 6-films being planned. The third movie was a scripting mess that had multiple villains and still managed to have half the movie taken up with romance and talking about romance. The fourth movie never took off because despite numerous rewrites and retools, Director Sam Raimi continued to hate it; no surprise from me after seeing Spiderman 3.

Spiderman was rebooted in 2012 with The Amazing Spiderman, picking up where Raimi's Spiderman 4 was supposed to go; with the Lizard. Yet, many continued to cling to Tobey Maguire's version of Peter Parker like he were the characters originator. Despite the fact that The Amazing Spiderman has more depth, better acting, better scripting and better more fulfilling action sequences, people don't like change and as usual, fans don't like Hollywood taking liberties with the things they've wrapped their mind around already.

Amazing Spiderman 2, upon first observation looked as though it were going to fall into the same pitfall as numerous other superhero movies with too many story-lines going on. Early on it did have a couple awkward scene transitions. Although, for the most part, this is a movie about Spiderman and Electro with Oscorp and Harry Osborne in the background. As I said before, the scripting is well done, the balance is well juggled and regardless which story-line they are giving us, it all ties together in the end; a sign of much better writing than the original series.

I don't judge movies based upon what came before, what is 'supposed' to be or what my brain may have scripted for the movie, I judge based upon the movie at hand. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a tremendously fun, funny, dramatic and emotional success. Sally Field and Andrew Garfield bring a personality and depth to the character's that has done exactly what the creator's intended; rebooting the series and taking it to a new level.

I was excited after the first Amazing Spiderman because I knew that the establishment of Spiderman was out of the way; again, and that the second installment would be more fulfilling and more action packed. I was not disappointed and I can't wait for whatever is next in the Spiderman universe. For those who are still clinging to Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi; they aren't coming back. They are in the past. It's time to move on.",1399248000,8,2688,4.8881578947368425
6129545,4,B00H2FPY20,"I just finished watching The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I can simply say I was blown away by how impressive the sequel is. I enjoyed the first but it just felt like it was lacking sustenance. Yes it was a good reboot. Yes it stayed true to the character. And yes it was ""Amazing"" (see what I did there? haha). But, ASM2 surpassed it by far. Director Marc Webb took what worked for the first and mastered it for the second. The action was in your face. The web slinging was true to character. And there was a lot more depth to this movie. Andrew Garfield this time around was in his comfort zone and portrayed Spider Man I believe in ways that other guy couldn't. (Yes I know his name is Toby Maguire). I mean he did satisfactory because he was the first to play the web crawler, but Garfield in MY opinion is a better fit the role. Jamie Foxx did a FANTASTIC Electro. Paul Giamatti was , meh, as Rhino. I just felt his Russian acting was a bit corny. Last but not least the two main characters that I think stole the show were Dane DeHaan and Emma Stone who played Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy respectively. They were the connection to Peter and they it was perfectly executed. The broken Friendship and the Broken Relationship played on Peter's emotions to the point he almost gave up and that to me made for better story telling. So here are my likes and dislikes of the film.

Pro's:

- The action was on point.

- Graphics were phenomenal.

- The Relationship between Peter and Gwen had more depth and felt more real.

- The villains made sense and didn't feel like they were thrown in just for a royal rumble.

- Movie had me actually tear up at the end. It was well executed.

- Stayed true to the comics (not spoiling it for you)

Cons:

- The movie seemed lacking in Fluidity between scenes. There were no easy transitions

- Rhino was mediocre at best. Very corny.

- There was no MAIN Villain. I kinda wished it was someone in the shadows working the angles rather than a couple people coming together because they disliked Spider-Man.

All in all I give this movie a solid 8.7/10. It was very enjoyable and I believe this time around it was done right. Sure it has it's flaws but the positives outweighed the negatives. GO SEE IT!",1399248000,4,2238,4.327751196172249
6129546,3,B00H2FPY20,"Spider Man 2 accomplishes one thing, it proves that this reboot of Spider Man will never top the Raimi trilogy. I went into the theater with low expectations after reading some lukewarm reviews. I ended up being even more disappointed than I expected.

The film starts out very good, but with too many distractions to really tell a well thought out story. Peter and Gwen's relationship, Peter and Aunt May, Peter's search for the truth about his parents and so on and so forth. The problem with all of these little diversions is that it gets in the way of character development and that is where this film fails miserably.  We don't care about the villains ( and our hero and his girlfriend or aunt for that matter) in this film because they have no substance.

Villain design is weak, Electro isn't bad, but it would have been a nice nod to the comic version if they could have had the electric in his body sort of shooting out of his head to mimic the lightning bolt mask his comic counterpart wore.  The Goblin is especially weak with some ridiculous non-sense about a strange family disease which is fatal, but why the spider venom turns him into a greenish lunatic is a mystery? The Rhino looks cool, but we'll get to that in a minute....

After the opening sequence there isn't much action for a long time and I found myself getting bored. The entire sub plot about Peter's parents should have been dropped from this film. It wasn't too distracting in the first film as it didn't bog things down, but in the film it is totally unnecessary and it isn't really engaging enough to take away from developing the characters of Max and Harry, so the development of the villains is basically non existent.

When we do get action the special effects are great but the baddies seem to get beaten much too quickly. The goblin appears and then gets defeated in a minute and you're left thinking ""that's it?"" The worst of all is the Rhino which is just a shameless plug for a future installment. When the film ended I didn't feel satisfied at all. In fact I was disappointed with most of it.

The best parts of Spider Man 2 are when we get to see ol' web head doing what he does best, cracking jokes and swinging through the city. Garfield  may have Spider Man down, but he isn't nearly as interesting as McGuire was as Parker. Garfield's Parker is much too sure of himself and seems out of character as the genius nerd he should be. Sure he grew into his confidence later in the comics, but that was way later in comic history.  Garfield's Parker had confidence right from the get go in the first movie so we don't see much growth. The Parker from the early comics would have never stood up to Flash ( before being bitten by the spider) like he does in the first film.

The chemistry between him and Stone is very good thou and probably the strongest point in both films( besides the great special effects), but they spend too much time with their drama and it isn't nearly as interesting as McGuire and Dunst from the Raimi trilogy. I don't ever want to hear how bad Spider Man 3 was again because compared to this film it was the Citizen Kane of super hero films!

I usually wait for the video release to come out before I review a film, but I wanted to write this while it was fresh in my mind, hopefully I'll like it more the second time around, but I doubt it.",1399248000,12,3360,4.394524959742351
6129547,5,B00H2FPY20,"Let me just state right here at the beginning that I am still not in favor of Sony's reboot of the Spider-Man franchise; however, seeing that they have, and that this movie is based off of the previous (un)Amazing movie and not Raimi's series, I have to say... okay, I'll sum it up like this: This one made me tear up.

I think I've mentioned before that I don't cry at movies.

I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but I am going to talk a bit about the set up. More movies need a good exposition; it sets up the emotional impact.

There's a significant difference between ""starting in the middle of the action"" and starting in the middle of some action. Increasingly, ""starting in the middle of the action"" is a bad thing to do. AS2 chooses to start in the middle of some action, the obligatory car chase. This action scene, though, serves as the setup for much of the rest of the movie: we see that Peter is haunted by the death Captain Stacy (and his admonition to safeguard Gwen by staying away from her), Spider-Man saves Max Dillon (though, in one of the few just nonsensical moments in the movie, he stops to save this one guy from getting hit by a car while doing nothing to stop the dozens of cars that are being destroyed), and we are introduced to Aleksei Sytsevich.

This scene sets up two of the three major conflicts for the movie: the romantic conflict between Peter and Gwen, and the physical conflict between Spider-Man and Electro. The third conflict revolves around Peter's continued exploration into the deaths of his parents, a story line they are developing at a nice pace and are handling better than expected. [This is spoilery, but, being someone who never knew his father, the scene between Peter and May was excellent. His assertion to her in the face of her reluctance to tell him anything that ""it's not about you"" is so right.]

And that's as far as I can go without giving things away but, from an emotional standpoint, this movie is way beyond the first one. Garfield really brings you along on his emotional ride as both Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, and I don't think that's a small thing. Like I said, I teared up.

Emma Stone put in a great performance as Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx was much better as Max Dillon than as Electro, although it's hard to tell how much of anything he did as Electro. Dane DeHaan put in a convincing enough Harry Osborn [although I'm not sure how I feel about them bringing that character in as Peter's ""best friend"" when they hadn't seen each other in a decade]. And Paul Giamatti was almost unrecognizable as the Russian thug Aleksei Sytsevich. Sally Field continues to not really do it for as Aunt May, but I'll give her a pass, sort of, for that one scene with Peter about his parents.

Also, kudos for introducing us to the character of Felicia, whom I have to suppose is Felicia Hardy and the future Black Cat.

The only real flub of the movie is a stupid science thing they did during a discussion about spiders and how spiders have cells that can ""self repair"" while humans don't. If humans' cells couldn't self repair, we'd all die the first time we got a cut or a broken bone or whatever. Sure, they're trying to talk about the rapid-style healing/regeneration of, like, Wolverine, but they do it in a piss-poor manner that makes it sound like people can't heal from, well, anything.

But that moment aside, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a much better movie than its predecessor. This one has all of the emotional impact that the first one was missing, possibly because they are no longer relying on what we ought to already know about Spider-Man and telling us what we don't know about Spider-Man. Their Spider-Man. So, again, if you like super hero movies and lots of action, this movie is for you but, unlike with most of these kinds of movies, you might want to bring a tissue for this one.",1399161600,6,3880,4.492198581560284
6129548,4,B00H2FPY20,"TASM2 is a superhero flick that's far more concerned about the emotional relationships of its main characters over the pyrotechnics and flashiness of the superheroics and fighting, though you still get a lot of that too.

TASM2 strikes an emotional chord with its two leads Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).  Their late teen young love relationship is believable and feels like it runs deep.  Parker, concerned for Stacy's safety and haunted by the promise he made to Captain Stacy, her father, at the time of his death continues to try to distance himself from her in order to keep her from harm's way.  And he's a bit miserable for it.  Stacy too is unhappy about this and her strong independence slaps Parker's pushing away across his face; she loves him and will not be denied and the two cannot stay away from each other for long.  Emma Stone is a bright light in this surprisingly dark tale (though punctuated with timely Spidey action and more classic Spidey verbal snarkiness), conveying warmth and fidelity and longing and determination through her incredibly expressive face and vulnerable eyes.  Andrew Garfield is tasked with being funny, coy, and conflicted and thus has the more difficult acting role here; he does a pretty good job with it.

While Parker and Stacy's on-again off-again relationship is at the heart of this film and comprises a huge portion of this tale of love and loss there is also the backstory of Peter's parents, his relationship with aunt May, and a boyhood relationship with Harry Osborn that also spin our heads with additional stories of love and loss.  There's possibly a bit too much thrown in with all of this adding with it not just the film's central ""villain"" Electro (I enclose ""villain"" in quotes because here we have Jamie Foxx playing a social outcast who also seems mentally ill--or is he a social outcast because he's mentally ill? the film doesn't ask or attempt to answer this question--as a person who develops a megalomaniacal complex not in line with any classic villain who is ""bad"" because they don't care about the suffering of others) but also brings in the Rhino too little and too late and gives a short and unsatisfying span of time to (yet again) the Green Goblin.

The performances with these characters are fine, engaging even, and though this SM iteration doesn't throw them all into the stew at the same time as Spider-man 3 had it still ends up feeling like a case of overload (I couldn't resist an electrical pun) or crowding out the film unnecessarily.  Mind you this film handles it much better than SM3 plied it.  There are also several pieces set in place for future films and for the rumored spin-off movie ""Sinister Six"" but these are likely only to be spied by the eyes of comic book fandom and not by the casual eyes of the general moviegoer.

My last comment is a caution to the adults with particularly young children who will want to be seeing this film (the trailers for it are simply great): this is a much less family-friendly Spider-Man movie with far darker elements, including the surprisingly violent opening of the movie that would be especially difficult for a child to place in context of the larger film.  Parents may want to heed the PG-13 rating in this case (not much language and no sex though) and view it themselves before showing it to the under 10 set.

If I wasn't with my cousin, who wanted to stay till the bitter end, I would have walked out. This movie was a  big disappointment for me because I really like the character Spiderman; sad to see a Spiderman movie botched to the point of being painful to watch.",1399161600,18,416,4.265822784810126
6129550,4,B00H2FPY20,"Nine Things about the Movie The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (USA, 2014)

1. I liked this movie more than I thought I would. Its thoughtful, character-driven, and is perhaps the most human superhero movie Ive seen. They changed a few things from the official Spider-man mythology, so of course, Marvel purist fans that cant handle change will howl.

2. The movie has a lot of storylines going at the same time - Peter being Spider-man; Peters conflicted relationship with his girlfriend; the mystery of Peters father and his secret project; the introduction of Harry Osborne on his way to becoming the Green Goblin; and the creation of Electro. This makes the movie seem a little rushed sometimes (there is even a scene in the official trailer that would have added another subplot, but it doesn't appear in the actual movie).

3. The acting in this movie is awesome, particularly for a superhero movie. Almost everyone really nails their character, especially Andrew Garfield. He made Peter a real, confused, normal young man with a lot of issues.

4. Jamie Foxx is great as the mentally unstable electrical engineer that turns into electricity or whatever. From the trailer, I thought he would suck, but he turned out to be one of the best villains in this Spider-man world, because they gave him a really empathetic backstory.

5. The action scenes are great. The whole movie is beautiful to watch, and there are some really cool 3D parts. Especially the Electro scenes.

6. For a movie that is almost 2 hours long, there are relatively few action sequences. There is a bigger focus on character development and drama. While some people may find it boring, I thought it was refreshing and interesting.

7. I usually hate romantic subplots, but the story of Peter and Gwen worked for me. They had real chemistry, and they made me actually feel for them.

8. The only thing I really hated about the movie is Spider-mans stupid little jokes and one-liners. They really pulled me out of the movie. I mean, cant we have a super-hero that isn't a cheesy smart-ass when he talks to bad guys?

9. The movie is ostensibly about hope (it gets hammered into us repeatedly). But below the surface, the movie is really about abandonment, betrayal, helplessness, and coming to terms with the fact that you cant save everyone, no matter how superheroic you may be.",1399161600,3,2344,4.79652605459057
6129551,2,B00H2FPY20,"Well Amazing Spider-Man 2 was better than the previous one but it's still a convoluted mess and too over melodramatic for no reason. It suffers from Spider-Man 3 syndrome combined with Batman Forever corny-ness. It was borderline Batman and Robin. There was too much Peter and Gwen to the point it was bashing it over our heads. We get it, they're meant to be. Jaime Foxx and Paul Giamatti were wasted and they're over the top hammy acting didn't help either. One too many actors did terrible over the top acting. This felt like a 90's comic book movie which isn't a good thing. The villain arcs were poorly done too. Electro came across a manchild, Rhino was very cheesy and terrible and Harry became the Green Goblin way too quickly. The original score and soundtrack was very annoying too. The first time I didn't like a Hans Zimmer score. It doesn't even come close to Danny Elfman's terrific theme. Some of the music was ill timed and the dubstep theme for Electro was grating on the ears. It's not terrible but not great or ""Amazing"" either. Andrew Garfield's performance as Spidey/Peter saves it from being a terrible movie. I wish Sony studios would stick to the original source material which would have helped. The problem is Sony and Avi Arad just want to make the Spider-Man universe a cash cow for them. This new reboot series will never come close to being better than Sam Raimi's trilogy, yes including Spider-Man 3.",1399161600,10,1431,4.682539682539683

6129554,4,B00H2FPY20,"...I was pleasantly surprised by Amazing Spider-man 2. I was expecting an ""average"" movie and saw a ""good"" one. Gwen is fabulous as played by Emma Stone. Peter is a bit too talkative and hyper for me. He is distinctly different from the comics from 1966 throughout the early 90's. Toby McGuire's and especially the comics of that era portrayed Peter as an unpopular geeky bright guy who is way out of his league with Gwen Stacey (His first love- comics) and/or Mary Jane (First trilogy). It was only when he dawned the outfit that he became really cool- and that strikes a chord with many- pretty much everyone who hated high school.
...A few positives:
...Spider-man physically looks like Peter. This was not the case in the trilogy nor in the early comics. Before, it was more than his confidence that grew behind the mask- his muscles grew as well! I really like this portrayal, where that doesn't happen.
...Electro is amazing! Fox's acting is solid and the special fx are like nothing I've ever seen before. They are..., ""Electric""! Sorry- just had to say it.
...The actor playing Norman Osborne is fantastic! He really fills up a screen- reminds me of Leonardo Dicaprio in many ways. Only negative was the makeup for his goblin scenes. Not to my liking.
...SPOILER ALERT. The movie follows the comic with regards to Peter and Gwen. I won't spell it out, but this was an extremely important part of Peter's story- practically as big as his Uncle Ben's death.
...A few negatives:
...A bit long for my liking, but this is relatively minor unless you're bringing younger children. The second act drags at times.
...As Stan Lee once explained: Marvel is Spider-man and visa versa; however, Spider-man is more a tale of Peter than it is of Spidey. Peter Parker is the key, and always has been. Once again, Toby McGuire's Peter was familiar to me- the 2014 Peter is not- but who knows... you may like him better!",1399075200,3,1911,4.673590504451038

6129556,3,B00H2FPY20,"I honestly didn't expect much from this movie. I thought the first Amazing Spider Man was incredibly average and with all the trailers, promotions, sneak peeks, etc I felt like I already saw a fourth of the movie. You don't build excitement for a movie by giving it all away in the previews, you build it by keeping most of the movie in the dark and leaving your potential audience guessing. More is not always better. More is, in fact, quite often worse. A good marketing campaign doesn't tire you out before actually seeing the movie. Sure I wanted to see it, but I was very cautious about getting my hopes up.

It's been a few years since the events of the firs Amazing Spider man, and New York has really opened up to their friendly neighborhood Spider Man. Though we're treated to the by now clich comments about vigilante justice, and their role in society (groan) for the most part people appreciate a hero doing the job the police are too stupid, it seems, to do themselves. Peter Parkers love life is also on solid grounds as he's started dating Gwyn Stacy again, despite his promise to her father not to do that. Overall things seem to be going pretty well for the web swinger. He even gets to save Jami Fox and stop some criminals from stealing plutonium. That must have been pretty cool.

Okay, so first let me tell you what I liked about this movie. First off, I don't think there's any doubt about who is the superior Spider Man now. I loved the original Tobey Maguire movies (well, the first two at least) but Andrew Garfield blows him out of the water with his performance. He is absolutely amazing as both Spider Man, and as Parker. His sarcastic and good natured super hero persona is funny as hell and brings the character from the comics and old TV show to life perfectly. The original trilogy never got that part right, so I'm happy to see this new series decided to stay truer to the character. Parker, likewise, spends a fair amount of time agonizing over the preventable death of Gwyn Stacy's father and blaming himself for what happened. Though there were quite a few times when the script and directing really let him down Garfield delivered a believable character anyway. Even his ""cry face"" is better than Maguire's. Really though, all of the cast delivered solid performances. Emma Stone again gave us all a believable and relatable Gwyn Stacy while Dane DeHaan was brilliant as Harry Osborne. Even Jami Fox had a good performance, though I mostly hated his character, but more on that later.

Second, the special effects and most of the action is very well done. This wasn't a surprise, of course, as we've seen a TON of it in the trailers already. The film looks amazing from opening shot to the end. And that ending, God that was a good ending. This is a spoiler free review, so no worries, but I will say that for a film that's mostly light hearted fun they really managed to bring it back to earth with a final that's both shocking (for those not familiar with Spider Man lore at least) and emotional. It took a lot of guts to do what they did, so for that I salute you Marc Webb.

It was also great to see that the trailer was mostly misleading. I know that sounds like it should be a negative but here me out. I really thought this movie was going to seem crowded in the same way Spider Man 3 was crowded. We already had Electro taking up screen time, but then we also had Green Goblin and Rhino making an appearance as well. Not only that but it was also hinted that maybe Vulture and Dr. Octopus would show up at some point. Well let me put that fear to rest. We do get three villains here, but only one has any sort of screen time, so it never felt crowded. One villain per movie I always say. Very few films can get away with more than that.

The problems for this film come mostly from the conflicting tones within it. Most super hero films fall into one of two categories; the dark brooding serious film like The Dark Knight and The Winter Soldier, or the light hearted good natured action romp, like The Avengers and the first Iron Man. Either their gritty and realistic, or fantastic and family friendly. Neither is better than the other, it all just depends on the tone the director wants to set. Problems arise, however, when you try to mix the two together. Surly The Dark Knight wouldn't have been the same with the added ingredients of slapstick comedy and ""will they won't they"" teenage puppy love anymore then The Avengers would have benefited from torture, brutal death scenes, and completely over the top conspiracy theories. The Amazing Spider Man 2 tries to do all these things at once and ends up coming out as a big fat sloppy mess. It at times wants me to take it seriously, then changes course and turns into a feel good super hero romp, and then switches again to dark and dreary. There's a very inconsistent tone and theme here which just left me confused and conflicted. It doesn't help that the music they scored for this film is so awful and distracting that I wished they would turn it off. It's not that I didn't like its individual pieces, but they just don't go together all that well. The pieces are greater than the finished product, which is a shame because I do think that with better editing this could have been a far better movie.

Another point of contention for me was the character of Max Dillon, played by Jami Fox. Now I loved Electro, I thought he was an excellent villain AFTER he ditched his old shelf and gave in complexity to his new persona, but I didn't like him as Max. For one his character motivation is just so ridiculous and stupid I couldn't take him seriously at all. For most of the film I thought he was mentally handicapped, maybe suffering from Asperger's or another form of autism, but by the end of the film he'd dropped that completely. Turns out he was just a socially awkward looser the whole time. It could have been pretty interesting had he been slightly mentally handicapped. Could have brought up an intriguing dilemma, but nope he's just a looser and hates Spider Man for... taking the spotlight away from him? Spraying him with water? Not remembering his name? I... I don't know, and nor do I care. He's just not a compelling character. He's a compelling villain, sure, with his Dr. Manhattaning and all that, but a lame character.

I really wish Sony would give Spider Man back to Marvel. I have no doubt that if the web slinger was allowed to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe we would get a film to rival the original Spider Man 2 (still my favorite SM movie to date) and would eventually see what we've all want; Spider Man teaming up with The Avengers. Is that going to happen? Probably not, though the end credits scene provides some interesting possibilities for an alternative cross over. Not the cross over I want, God no, but an interesting one non the less.",1399075200,11,6880,4.4860335195530725
6129557,5,B00H2FPY20,"(No spoilers) I just watched the movie this past evening.  This movie, while not without its flaws, has set a new high bar for me for superhero movies.

Did this movie need to be as long as it is?  No; it certainly could have benefitted from a bit more judicious editing.  But for me, from storyline to dialogue, general acting and directing to cinematography, fight choreography to special effects--even the score--in all ways this movie met and generally exceeded (sometimes greatly) my expectations.

I generally prefer Marvel movies, even licensed ones, to DC.  Marvel tends to bring more consequences to its films and more grey areas.  Villains aren't simply warped and evil psychopaths, but complex and often misunderstood, er, psychopaths.  And this movie lived up to that standard for me.  I also was never much impressed with the Raimi/Maguire trilogy (especially the organic webbing).  Garfield has the attitude down perfectly, reintroduces us to Spidey's intellect (it is so much more impressive that he designed and engineered his webshooters [as shown in the first film]) and gives us a very human superhero.  This Spider-man puts his life on the line and goes all out; something I had thought only really came through in the first trilogy when Maguire stopped the runaway train.

Wow, it's hard to write this without giving anything away!

In the end, there are some missteps.  If you were in love with the last trilogy, you probably won't like this one nearly as much.  But if you were a fan of the comics, you may see, as I do, this as being much more in line with the webhead you know and love.  And, as an added bonus, I think that some of the ""background"" material that occurs in this movie sets up an even more interesting turn of events for the next movie besides who the villain(s) may be.

6129559,2,B00H2FPY20,"As a child, I have always been a fan of Marvel comic creations such as Conan, Kull, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Ka-zar, Dr. Strange, Dracula, Satana, and Son of Satan, however, I have never liked the general fodder among comicdom fans from D.C. such as Superman, Green Lantern and Tarzan, any more than I acceptable popular icons from Marvel such as Batman, Spiderman, Daredevil, X-men or Fantastic Four; with that being said, I, nevertheless, religiously patronized all Hollywood adaptations of comic books on the hope that, being block buster movies, that they will be sufficiently reinvented as to be interesting, entertaining and enjoyable on the big screen, only to find a mixed batch that varies from the brilliantly imaginative and engrossing - such as The Amazing Spider Man, Man of Steel and The Avengers, to the disappointing and uninspired such as The Superman quad ology, Superman Returns, The Batman trilogy - save for The Dark Knight (which was passable), The Spiderman trilogy - save for Spiderman (which was mediocre), The Ironman trilogy - save for Ironman (which was better than expected), Daredevil (which I hated), Green Lantern (which was slightly above average), The Hulk franchise - which I never fancied save for The Incredible Hulk - featuring one of my childhood idols, Lou Ferrigno, The X-man franchise - save for X-man First Class and Wolverine ( which were better than average), and The Fantastic Four trilogy - save for Fantastic Four (which was okay).

Having said that, The Amazing Spiderman blew me away with an engrossing narrative featuring one of the best screenplays ever written for Marvel adaptations, well developed and endearing characters - played dramatically well by Andrew Garfield and the gorgeous Emma Stone (who will literally take your breath away), interesting and convincing dialog (tete-a-tete) between the characters, an engrossing storyline that will serve well as escapism and make you forget all your problems for the duration of the movie, fantastic Spiderman costume design - which constitutes the best ever featured in a movie, great cinematography, impeccable editing and use of trajectory in film, well developed pace, great soundtrack and unobtrusive incorporation of music to enhance the visual aspects of the movie, and, best of all, the best web-swinging action ever captured on film - courtesy of great stunt work and awe-inspiring CGI from Sony's Imagework, which I believe will be a force to be reckoned with in the field of special effects in the foreseeable future, as well as the best 3D generated effects since Avatar.

So, when the sequel to the Amazing Spiderman, The Amazing Spiderman - Rise of Electro, was officially launched in Malaysian cinemas, I was among the first to catch it in 3D, only to leave the theatre with mixed feelings regarding the movie - in part, pacified but predominantly greatly disappointed, given the fact that the movie showed incredible promise during the first half of the feature film - with apt performances by Andrew Garfield and the ever gorgeous Emma Stone, an interesting storyline - that is only marred by the slight digression incorporating an annoying regurgitation of the plot in the first movie and the irritating and somewhat superfluous dwelling on Peter Parker's father's past that serve only to detract from the main plot, the ever endearing characters that elicit empathy from the audience, the well written screenplay that managed to create an engrossing film, awe-inspiring CGI from Imagework and fantastic action sequences that thrill and excite, which transforms into a big let-down upon the introduction of Electro, played by the ever annoying Jamie Foxx - whose character appeared somewhat one-dimensional and unconvincing, and, upon his transformation into Electro, witnessing CGI that appear unrealistic and overblown and, that rather enhancing the action sequences only serve to despoil the thrill generated during the first half of the movie, coupled with the fact that neither the costume design for Electro and the Hob Goblin nor the transformer-like suit for the Rhino were anywhere near inspiring, the incontrovertible fact that all three of Spidey's nemesis were too easily defeated in what constitutes anti-climactic fight sequences, and that the story begins to replicate the formula for part one during the second half with Gwen attempting to convince Peter Parker to accept her assistance and, eventually, prevailing.

The sequel appears to be the fledging and misdirected attempt by Marc Webb to introduce new villains whom he can spin off for future instalments, in the hope of generating more revenue for Sony Pictures and Columbia.",1399075200,9,4679,5.236
6129560,3,B00H2FPY20,"If the title isn't obvious enough, the following review contains MAJOR SPOILERS from The Amazing Spider-Man 2. If you have not seen the film yet, you should get out of here right now.

I had no idea what to expect going into the Amazing Spider-Man 2. I really enjoyed the Sam Raimi trilogy, excluding the infamous Spider-Man 3, and I had mixed feelings on 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man. So how does Peter Parker's second adventure in this rebooted comic book adaptation pan out?

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is easily a FAR more enjoyable film than it's predecessor, however it doesn't quite live up to it's title in my opinion. Basically it's not a bad film, but it was held back and could have turned out so much better. So what went wrong?

This movie, much like the first movie is littered with sequel bait, or more appropriately Sinister 6 bait. What I mean is that the main purpose of this movie is to set up story lines for the villains that will appear in the inevitable Sinister 6 movie that Sony announced a few months ago. For those not heavily invested in the Spider-Man comics, the Sinister 6 is a special team-up of 6 Spidey foes that work together to defeat Spider-Man. The roster has undergone many different iterations, however the most common lineup has been Hob Goblin, Dock-Ock, Sandman, The Vulture, Electro, and Mysterio.

Now there is nothing wrong with a little bit of sequel bait as long as the movie can still stand on it's own. The Empire Strikes Back is regarded by many as the best Star Wars film of all time, and even the best film in general of all time by others. This film had PLENTY of sequel bait that played out in Return of the Jedi, but the purpose of the movie wasn't just to set up RotJ, it was to help progress the overall story arc of the main characters. This is where The Amazing Spider-Man 2 falls flat as a pancake.

This movie feels like nothing but a giant ""checklist"" for Sony to go through so that they have everything covered for Sinister 6, and it serves little additional purpose other than to actually tell ""The Untold Story"" that was plastered all over the ads for the first movie. Because of this giant checklist, the movie has to rush through important character development, and tell the story through some pretty poor exposition sequences; heavily damaging the final product in the end. Let's talk about how this damages our villains.

THE RHINO: Completely Unnecessary. First off, he only appears in the last 3 minutes of the film in a 10 second fight sequence that felt EXACTLY like the Underminer at the end of The Incredibles. Second, the whole scene is just poorly done in general, but the amount of time it took to build up the fight scene could have been used to further flesh out characters. It's just so out of left field and doesn't need to be in the movie. The only reason he's in is because Sinister 6.

THE GREEN GOBLIN: Harry Osborn in my opinion suffers the worst from the checklist, which is especially bad since the movie makes it SUPER obvious that he will be the leader of the Sinister 6. The movie is over 2 and a half hours long, yet we have very little time to get to know Harry because of all of the other jumbled events taking place. We first meet Harry coming home to his dying father, Norman Osborn, where the movie establishes with the audience that Harry has daddy issues, much like the comics. Then in the first of many terrible exposition sequences, Norman decides to FINALLY tell Harry that he has the disease that he's dying from. Why does Harry only have a few weeks to live while Norman is in his 60's? Why did Norman wait until now to tell HIS SON that he has a life threatening disease? Because it's a convenient plot point.

We get a couple of great scenes between Harry and Peter as they rekindle their past friendship, and I would have loved to see more of that. What happens is that Harry finds out that Spider-Man (not knowing that Spidey and Peter are one in the same) got his powers from an Oscorp experiment and comes up with a hypothesis that if he injects himself with some of Spider-Man's blood, he can cure himself. Of course this puts Peter in an uncomfortable situation, not knowing what could happen to Harry if he came into contact with his blood, and eventually goes to Harry as Spider-Man to explain why he can't do it. The scene itself is fantastic, but by this time Harry feels like a completely different character switching from sympathizing with Spider-Man to wanting to murder him.

Eventually, while searching through various Oscorp project files, Harry finds a location kept secreted from him that has extracted DNA from the Spiders that created Spider-Man. He also discovers that Oscorp has been doing secret bio weapons experiments on numerous subjects, including Max Dillon (Electro) and falsely signing the clearance under his name. Oscorp finds out that he knows this information and fires him. Why is Harry fired? Well because Oscorp is evil. Why is Oscorp evil? Because Sinister 6. Anyways, this causes Harry to break out Electro who breaks him back into Oscorp to help him gain clearance to the Spider DNA. After being injected, he's cured. Oh yeah and he turns into the Green Goblin, which is thankfully explained in another poor exposition sequence thanks to Richard Parker. After this though, he still wants to kill Spider-Man even though he's cured. Why? Because Sinister 6. Oh and because Green Goblin has to kill Gwen Stacy just like in the comics so that it can pretend it's trying to appease the hardcore Spider-Man fans (let the butthurt commence). The scene itself is actually VERY well done, and in my opinion has even more emotional impact than how it was done in the comics, but for the movie it was completely unnecessary and could have easily been done by...

ELECTRO: Electro is actually executed for the most part very well in this movie. My only gripe is that I think his time as Max Dillon could have been handled better. Like Harry's story arc, because the movie has so many events happening, there's not much time to get to know Max's character, making him come off more as creepy rather than just lonely and in need of a friend.

These are the main problems I have with this movie. There are other problems such as Peter and Gwen's relationship feeling super awkward, and even stalkerish at times, or some of the writing in the script that just feels off, but they don't bog down the movie to the extent that the handling of the villains does.

I've addressed my criticisms with the movie, however I still found it enjoyable in the end, let's talk about what the movie did right. :)

THE SCORE: One of my biggest complaints for the first film was the score done by James Horner, which I thought was bland and forgettable. Hans Zimmer composed the score for this movie and it is WONDERFUL. The main theme is so catchy, fits Spider-Man's character, and the overall feel of the movie. It also feels quite different from Hans's previous work, featuring prominent electric guitar throughout, and even Dubstep in certain pieces relating to Electro. Most of Hans Zimmer's modern scores rely heavily on the strings section, with maybe some subtle synthesizers to go with it. The score for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 focuses a lot more on the wind section, specifically the trumpets which are the shining piece of the main theme. Is it better than Danny Elfman's score from the original trilogy? I personally don't think so, but it's still a very creative and catchy score nonetheless. I would highly recommend a purchase of this film's soundtrack.

ELECTRO: While I thought Max Dillon was weak, his transformation to Electro and everything after was handled amazingly. Jamie Foxx completely owns the role once Electro is born. He's absolutely terrifying and if he doesn't appear in Sinister 6... I'll be shocked (bun dun chhh).

SPIDER-MAN: I think Toby Maguire is a better Peter Parker than Andrew Garfield (cue the fanboy rage), but I thought Andrew Garfield was a bit better inside the costume for the first movie than Toby was in the whole trilogy. In this movie, Andrew IS Spider-Man. This is the on screen Spider-Man I have always wanted to see. His personality inside the mask feels like it has been ripped right out of the pages of the comics. From cracking jokes and overall sarcasm to his foes, to being an inspiring role model to the people of New York, Andrew Garfield is most certainly your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

GWEN STACY: Emma Stone has done a fantastic job as Gwen Stacy, and I'm sincerely going to miss her in the coming movies. Besides a couple awkward scenes regarding her relationship with Peter, overall her character was done justice, which is far more than I can say for Spider-Man 3.

THE FIGHTING: These are the best Spider-Man fight sequences I've ever seen on the big screen. The only fight I like better is the Clock Tower/Metro fight with Dock-Ock in Spider-Man 2 (though that is a VERY difficult fight to live up to). Spidey has never been more agile and diverse.

SUMMARY: In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a film that puts plenty of cool ideas and fan service on the table (including a cameo by Felicia Hardy, who becomes the Black Cat in the comics), but rushes through all them in a single movie rather than spacing the ideas out into two movies because Sinister 6. While this brings down the film quite a bit, it is still a very entertaining summer blockbuster in the end.

One last important thing that should be mentioned is the mid credits scene. Instead of putting a typical hidden scene during the mid or end credits, instead there is a brief scene from the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past. There IS NOT going to be a Spider-Man/X-Men crossover. If you're up to date with the whole licensing fiasco between Marvel, Fox, and Sony then you'll probably realize this. This was likely put in to fool the more casual movie goers into seeing Days of Future Past thinking that a crossover was happening. Yes I stayed all the way through the credits. That's all you're going to get. It's very lame.",1399075200,6,10091,4.639977603583427

The look itself is bright & colorful like the comic books. Very much an improvement over the last film, but suffers with huge flaws. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is a complete utter mess. It's SPIDER-MAN 3 all over again, although not as convoluted as that was. Each backstory for the villains were so simple & little effort put into it. Dane DeHaan is a good Harry Osborn, but he's crowbar in the last 10 minutes once he becomes the Green Goblin. He looks & acts like Evil Ed from FRIGHT NIGHT. Jamie Foxx is completely wasted as Electro, he's so underused here. He's like a cross between Richard Pryor (SUPERMAN III) & Jim Carrey (BATMAN FOREVER). Paul Giamatti is just a cameo as The Rhino, he might as well not been there. He's just a future villain for the next sequel. The storyline structure was so sloppy & so strung together...no pun intended. After seeing the trailers & TV spots, I feel like I saw about 80% of the movie before actual seeing it, that's just sad. What could have been the next great comic book sequel like THE DARK KNIGHT, just ends up not quite hitting the mark. As a SPIDER-MAN sequel? Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 is still far superior. Overall, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is not so amazing, but more like THE SO SO SPIDER-MAN. It feels less like a sequel & more like setup for next installment & future spin-offs. It does have it's moments here & there. It just too long, too bloated, & too overstuffed. See it as a low rental, go into it with low expectations. But if you are obligated to see it anyway in the theater, then see it for cheap at a dollar theater at the earliest matinee showing. There's no rush to see it, save your money there are better movies coming out this summer I'm sure of it.",1398988800,10,2040,4.413793103448276
6129562,2,B00H2FPY20,"I despised The Amazing Spider-Man, Sony's first bid to reboot the web-slinging franchise only a few short years after the lucrative and largely satisfying Tobey Maguire-led trilogy concluded.  Despite the charming romantic energy shared by freshman stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, I found the film to be a lethargic, unimaginative, and at times even unpleasant copy without distinction.  The second film (or one could call it the fifth) is a tad more satisfying, perhaps because it is more absurd and therefore more distinctive by default.  It is still, however, flawed through and through, further cementing poor Spider-Man as a hero with a fading star compared to, among others, Batman, Iron Man, and the X-Men.  Garfield and Stone are once again a pleasant pair, even when forced to go through predictable motions involving standard-issue secret-identity-versus-romantic-stability tension and a potential move to England for her.

The most dire problem here, as already diagnosed by many, is the vast amount of character and story crowded into every corner of its overlong two-and-a-half-hour length.  There is so much going on!  An example which illustrates the overall issue is the character of Harry Osborn, the troubled heir who is foe to Spider-Man, but friend to his alter-ego, Peter.  Dane DeHaan, replacing James Franco in the role, is a fantastic up-and-coming actor.  His icy blue eyes rivet, and he can sneer with style.  There is only so much he can do, though, when, within the space of this single film, Osborn is introduced, established as an old friend of Peter's, pushed to the edge of desperation, and then spends around five minutes as the notorious Green Goblin, complete with elf ears, a half-decomposed face, and a maniacal chortle reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz.  There is no grace, no sense of a natural human trajectory.  The character is always pushed by the mechanical requirements of the storyline, so the intended impact of every turn is at the very least halved.  This charge holds for most of the film's elements, including Jamie Foxx as Electro and an ongoing espionage-flavored mystery regarding Peter's parents, a bit of intended intrigue unique to this vein of Spider-Man films which is beyond uninteresting.  Kinetic, if plastic action sequences and a gifted cast can only compensate so much for a forced, soulless narrative.",1398988800,8,2371,5.172774869109948

If that wasn't enough Peter (Andrew Garfield) must deal with his on again/off again relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and he discovers the truth about his father (Campbell Scott) and Oscorp.

I love these modern superhero blockbuster updates...except for maybe that ""Green Hornet"" thing. What the heck was that about?

I will also say I disapprove of the character send off, but I'll get over it. The film contains drama and heart as well as good action scenes. If anything Spiderman was able to take care of his foes a little too easy.

The film sets up for a crazy action sequel. Break out the popcorn.",1398902400,2,739,4.7578125
6129565,4,B00H2FPY20,"Super heroes aren't enough, we also have super villains! And of course, our favorite guy is the one to confront them and save the world. This sequel is bigger, louder, with more vehicular mayhem and endless blowie uppie stuff, which is too bad, because this cast has skillful actors who can do anything. Watch for the lengthy scene with Peter and Aunt May; they are both terrific!

We have:
  * Andrew Garfield (""Never Let Me Go"") is Spider-Man/Peter Parker, the guy we just like. He's really dorky and his shy affection for Gwen is very effective.
  * Emma Stone (""The Help"") is Gwen Stacy, his steadfast girlfriend, in on his secret identity and smart as a whip; but we have to remember, Peter had promised her father he would stay away from her...
  * Jamie Foxx (""Django Unchained"") is Electro/Max Dillon, the nerdy guy everyone overlooks...even on his birthday. Finally, he gets MAD!
  * Dane DeHaan (""In Treatment"") plays Green Goblin/Harry Osborn, once a close friend of Peter's, soon to become a sworn enemy. Their fathers were fellow scientists working on that experimental spider serum.
  * Sally Field (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") returns as Aunt May, who can't help but worry about her sweet nephew because he persists in asking questions about his parents.

In this one we learn more about Peter's father, which is a welcome addition, and the relationship between Peter and Gwen is easy and fun. Another plus, this had more humor, with one-liners and goofy physical comedy. The late-in-the-movie evolution of Harry Osborne to Green Goblin is nothing but a prequel to the next movie.

To me, this felt like three movies...1) a nice PG-13 movie for Spider-Man fans, 2) an overwhelming eyeful for lovers of CGI, and 3) that aforementioned prequel. I enjoyed it, but found myself yawning during the lengthy scenes in which Midtown Manhattan is demolished. The screening version I saw was in 3D, so I dutifully ducked from flying debris and marveled at a snowfall. Be advised though, the story is paramount, $o don't $pend your money on 3D.",1398902400,6,2046,4.878612716763006
6129566,4,B00H2FPY20,"This is a hard review to write, because discussing the movie and what makes it work (or not) lends itself to spoiling, and I work very hard not to do that. Having said that, ASM 2 is a movie with a little bit of everything, lots of action, romance, comedy, tragedy, hope, and more action.

What Works?
-- The acting is very good. Pretty much across the board. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a real chemistry, and Jamie Foxx allows the viewer to follow along with his character's evolution from comic relief to dangerous threat. Dane DeHaan was new to me, but I thought he was excellent.
-- The special effects are phenomenal. I am not a fan of 3D movies, but this should be seen in 3D, as it is probably the best 3D effects I can recall seeing. The motion of web-swinging scenes is a little frenetic, particularly early on, but it smooths out.
-- Lots of little dropped names and visuals in the background, planting seeds for future movies.

What Didn't Work?
-- Peter's quest to learn more about his parents is a plot that gets a lot of airtime, but didn't seem to further the overall story. It just felt like it was there to create a mystery that didn't serve a purpose or have an acceptable payoff.
-- There are some serious heavy moments, one of which really stalls out the joy and adventure in the film. This cost the movie a five star review from me.

All told, this is a *very* good movie, which I wish had a slightly edited plot, so as not to derail the great momentum that was built for the movie and the franchise. Because of the effects, it should be seen on the movie screen, and in 3D or IMAX, or whatever fancy options are available. I don't often say that about movies, but this one deserves it.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1398816000,11,1735,4.362229102167182
6129567,3,B00H2FPY20,"UPDATE: ON THE BLU-RAY.

Video and audio quality for the film is very good, no surprise there, as it'd be silly for this day and age to release a Blu-Ray for a new film with bad quality.  The video and audio quality for the extras is a little more variable, as it depends on what camera they were using to film the backstage stuff.

The extras are as follows: An audio commentary with the filmmakers, a list of deleted and alternate scenes, a ""Making of"" documentary (which is divided in specific subsections regarding development, concepts, shooting, special effects, make-up, music and editing), a documentary on the making of the music (which finally explains why Zimmer sounds so different from usual) and a music video by Alicia Keys (because nothing makes a movie more timeless than a music videoclip, I guess).

The documentaries are pretty extensive and nice, but the really interesting part are the deleted scenes.  Just like for the previous film, I'm puzzled to see most of these scenes deleted, since they would have contributed a lot into making the film much better (or, at the very least, less dumb).  They show more interesting stuff happening, the characters acting like real people, there's more closure and suddenly some of the parts of the film don't look so ridiculous.  It's a shame, really, most of those scenes would have improved the film a lot.

Original review follows.

SHORT (for my usual writing) REVIEW FOR THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2:
It's OK.  It's better than the previous film in some areas, but its quality suffers in other ones.  The action scenes are the best part, they're fantastic, fun, visually striking and make good use of every character's abilities.  The cast for the movie is (no pun intended) amazing, specially newcomer Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn.  His intensely creepy performance will stay with you for a long time.

Unfortunately, the cast isn't given much to work with.  The characters are just poorly written.  Max Dillon is really fun, but once he turns into Electro, he becomes a one-dimensional character that would be at home in Spidey's 1967 cartoon series.  As great as he is, Foxx just doesn't have enough to work with, and asking of him to make Electro a compelling villain would be to ask a chef to bake a cake with one egg and a spoonful of flour.  Gwen has been reduced to a exposition-spewing caricature (also, she goes back to the tired old clich of the unsuportive superhero girlfriend), and DeHaan's screentime as the Green Goblin is so small that Venom from Spider-Man 3 embarrases him.  Sally Field's Aunt May has a couple of scenes that try to be tear jerking, but the dialogue she's given is so weak you can't help but think ""Yeah, yeah I got the point, stop droning"".

Director Marc Webb yet again thinks the audience is dumb, so his story is condescending and frankly insulting at some points.  Interviews reveal he's frankly surprised when people figure out the obvious plot points he believed to be subtle clues, so there's clearly no one to blame but him.  I really wish he stopped thinking he's so brilliant and gave audiences a little more credit.  I don't say he's dumb, but he clearly thinks we are.

Also, this film clearly shows Webb hasn't learned much from the problems with the previous franchise.  There are two main villains in this film (Rhino's bulk screentime is just what you see in trailers, no more, I tell you this so you won't be dissapointed), yet both get even less screentime than the villains in Spider-Man 3.  The motivations of the villains are even weaker this time than in that film and the reveal for ""the untold story"" that has been slammed on us since the first film is laughable.  It's like those friends who keep hyping a girl they want to set you up with and then when they introduce her it turns out she's a chihuahua.  Literally.

So, do I recommend this film?  Well, yeah.  Despite its flaws, it's still a really fun film, and isn't that what we all want?  It's not going to change your life, move you or be the best Spider-Man film, but it's going to entertain you, and I think that's the important part of a film.",1398816000,8,4127,4.673130193905817

So now that beautifully crooked smile and 1,000 yard stare will forever command a welcome place in the living space of our home, and will handed down for generations within our family bloodline, along with the 5-disc special edition of 'Philomena' encased in a rubbery bust of Judi Dench, and the 'Mars Needs Moms' limited edition Blu-ray presented in the form of a threatening debt collector's final notice.",1398643200,470,1092,4.854838709677419
