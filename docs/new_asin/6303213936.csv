596378,1,6303213936,"i don't understand why anyone would think this would make a good kids' movie.  when i first saw it, i was so scared i couldn't sleep and even thinking about it now freaks me out.  the thought of seeing something so scary in an abandoned house that you pass out and lose all your hair is beyond terrifying to me.  the idea of getting kidnapped and having your hair used to make magic paintbrushes in a factory full child slave laborers is even worse.  this movie really has it all.

im writing this review because a few days ago, while on vacation, someone said something that made me remember it.  the same old shiver and sleep deprecation is back.  im buying this movie hoping that if i face my fears, they will go away, but i don't know.  these scars just may be permanent.

i try to explain it to my friends but they mock me.  it's embarassing.

edit:  i was outbid on the movie and was so relieved that i decided i should probably never watch it again.",993600000,10,956,4.279329608938547
596379,5,6303213936,"I watched this movie over and over so many times when I was younger I had it memorized.  The part that creeped me out the most was the scene with the live paintings.  I felt sorry for the boy who couldn't grow hair, and the  peanutbutter solution making your hair grow reminded me a little of  Frecklejuice giving you freckles.  I was surprised when it actually worked  on him..
It is not your ordinary film, has a very twisted yet  fascinating plot.  If you liked this you will probably also like Return to  Oz and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen--two other fantastic films.  I  could not find the right version Return to Oz on here.  It has that girl  who played Nancy in The Craft as Dorothy, so you know it's an old film.",948499200,6,728,4.343283582089552
596380,5,6303213936,"Quite possibly the most life-changing film I have ever seen. Contains elements of the mythic, discusses adult topics such as balding with such delicate taste that a child may watch and not be disgusted. A contradictory  and complex protagonist, torn by adolescent fears; a loving sister; a  dedicated sidekick with endearingly Zen sensibilities; an evil artist with  a passion for magic paintbrushes; a trail of flour; a haunted house; a bum.  All the elements for cinematic success.  Although I have never been bald  myself, I could empathize with the bald little boy because his tears were  real, his smiles were sincere, and it looked like it really hurt when he  got the glued-on-wig pulled off of his head at the soccer game. Poor  redhead boy.",945648000,5,749,4.928
596407,5,6303213936,"This movie made such an impression on me as a child, but no one I spoke with had ever heard of it until....my husband's friend stayed with us.  Finally someone who had been equally effected by this movie!  I have only met two other people besides myself who have seen this movie.  I believe the magic of it lies in watching it while still young and impressionable.",1306281600,2,364,4.402985074626866

Strange. I wish there was a dvd version of this movie. I want to finish all the half there memories that I still have.

I saw this in the hospital when I about 8ish(2pac was still alive) and thought I made this up.",1292457600,,435,4.178571428571429
596409,5,6303213936,"What can I say here about this movie that hasn't already been said?  Like many of the other posters, this movie haunted me for years . . . and I wasn't sure whether it was a real movie or something I dreamed.  After looking it up on the internet, I found it, and couldn't believe all the reviews saying exactly what I went through with this movie.  My only problem is that this is in VHS!!! Someone please get this out on DVD!!!",1257724800,,428,4.132530120481928
596410,5,6303213936,"I too have been trying to remember this movie for years! Same story, i remember hair that wouldn't stop growing and it being cut to make something (paintbrushes!) and i thought i remember a paste that made the hair grow. I was totally freaked out by this movie, and had thought i had imagined it. Now i can rest easy knowing this was real, whew!",1243641600,3,345,4.323076923076923
596411,5,6303213936,"Well, it is good to see that I'm not alone in the feeling of craziness.  I too thought that this movie had just been my imagination and maybe I never really saw it.  I was talking to a friend about this crazy movie I once saw, or maybe didn't see. Well she remembered it and knew the title! I wave of relief swept over me.  So I searched and found it on amazon. Phew!",1241308800,,367,3.9324324324324325
596412,5,6303213936,"I saw this movie when I was a child with my older brother and sister. I loved it although I was a little bit scared. I have not ever been able to find anybody who knew about this movie. The laughed at me. They taunted me. They called me crazy. They said i was lying and that a movie of that sort never existed. So that led me to believe that I made it all up in my head. No one ever believed me about the aspects of this movie. The boy was frightened, all his hair fell out, his sister put a peanut butter mix on his scalp, his hair stared growing really fast, some man used his hair to make magic paintbrushes, etc etc. I am so happy that FINALLY somebody other than my siblings knows what I am talking about when I mention this movie. I only wish they would make his movie on DVD. I would buy 20 copies and give them all as christmas presents to the friends who told me the movie didn't exist. I think i am going to make a group on facebook for people who remember the Peanut Butter Solution and were called liars and traumatized by those who never had the joy of viewing this wonderful masterpiece.",1233878400,,1101,4.078341013824885
596413,5,6303213936,"Oh my god. After years of searching I've found this movie. I had little to go on - I saw it almost 20 years ago, with a childhood friend I no longer know. I just remember scenes - the soccer game when the kid loses his wig, and rubbing the formula on his head - not a lot to go on. I finally just researched and researched and found it.
I too thought I was insane! I thought I had made it up - even though I remember watching it with my friend in her living room. I tried to describe it to people and they just look at me like a weirdo.
I am so buying this movie. It's haunted me for years. And for some reason I thought it was a thriller too. It scared me so bad, and I'm not easily scared. I like the idea one reviewer had - to not watch it and preserve the innocence. But I really want to know the rest of the movie - and if it's even remotely scary!
Thanks for all the other reviewers, too. I know I'm not alone, and not crazy - at least about this!",1232496000,,953,3.7939698492462313
596414,5,6303213936,"I remember this movie I was 8 years old and I saw it on beta max at my aunt and uncle's house all the time. I also recall having strange dreams after watching the movie. ""Hair Raising Comedy"" what ever more like ""Hair Raising Nightmare"". But Still love this movie.",1232236800,,264,4.3

596416,5,6303213936,"There is something about a lot of the tunes in the movie that will just put you in a deep trance.

I remember really enjoying it and now that I found it, even if it is on VHS, I will have to watch it again it again.",1211241600,,284,3.564516129032258
596480,3,6303213936,"I just had the same experience as most other reviewers. Last night, while watching The Office, one of the characters had gum stuck in his hair and put peanut butter on it to get it out. A random vision popped in my head of a kid growing really long hair after putting peanut butter on his bald head. I asked my husband if he remembered such a movie, but he just thought I was crazy. I'm so glad to find that this movie actually exists. I remember being really scared after watching this movie as a child and I can still recall most of the sceens from it some 20 years later. I don't think I have any interest in watching it again because I don't want to ruin the magic of having watched it through the eye's of a child. My experience with it now, I'm sure, would be very different.",1209081600,,781,4.144736842105263
596481,5,6303213936,"I just discovered this movie tonight, when I got so frustrated after years and years of thinking that I had made up and just dreamed it that I turned to the internet.  The main page of Google stared me blankly in the face (just like everyone who ever had the confusing experience of hearing me explain this half-made-up-dream-movie-thing to them in the about 19 years since I'd seen it).  I put in the simplest terms I could to describe this movie: ""bald kid peanut butter hair movie"" and hoped for the best.  I can't begin to describe to you the relief and happiness I felt when ""The Peanut Butter Solution"" came up in every search result.  When I was little, I saw this movie more than once (my mom worked at a local elementary school and this video was, for some reason, in the library) and could never remember the name of it, only a few crazy scenes including one where the bald kid (Michael, I now know) was playing soccer with a wig he glued onto his head and had the embarrassing experience of having it pulled off his head only to quickly snap back down to his head.  I remembered shopping carts and what seemed to be a junk yard, basically just really random things that don't make any kind of sense.

Needless to say, this movie was CRAZY and seemed so strange that it could only be a dream.  You owe it to yourself to see this movie at least once.  I highly recommend it.  I only wish it was on dvd so that I could I have the physical proof to show everyone who didn't believe this strange kids movie could've possibly existed.

Oh, it was also responsible for me putting peanut butter in my hair when I got my first hair cut haha

I added this initially as a comment to my review, but I wanted to put it in the actual body of the review as well (Could we always edit our reviews?  I can't remember).  You can go to Google Video and do a search for ""The Peanut Butter Solution"" and the movie in its entirety is hosted there for streaming.  After rewatching it, I really can't believe they made this movie for young children.",1198713600,2,2036,4.295811518324608
596482,5,6303213936,"I am seriously surprised that this movie isn't on dvd! I just thought I had forgotten about it, NOT that it had been forgotten! I REALLY remember this movie! Like TONS of little details! *SPOILER* I remember some people in a kitchen in his house? I remember his little asian friend putting p.b. in a weird place, and I remember the evil man putting the little boy in a hog crate thing. I loved seeing the magical paintings unfold. I wish I could go rent it right now! I am really disappointed, it seems like everything else is on dvd!",1191542400,,534,4.35
596483,3,6303213936,"For some reason, I recently had a thought about a movie I saw as a kid about a boy who loses his hair and then he uses something that makes it continually grow. Like so many reviews I just read, I too thought it was some sort of dream. I could only remember a few things about it like the dog and the man who uses the hair for paint brushes. I did a search on the internet for a movie about a boy who has uncontrolled hair growth and found the title within minutes. Thank goodness, it wasn't a dream. I do remember watching this many times as a kid. I never remember being scared by it but it is definately a movie that sticks with you if you've ever seen it. What's funny though is that I was thinking of another rare movie that I used to watch as a kid and a few days later I saw it for sale. Maybe The Peanut Butter Solution will show up on DVD pretty soon, because I would love to buy it. I remember that I liked it as a kid but only gave it 3 stars because I am sure if I saw it now it would not have the same awe as it did back then.",1190851200,3,1039,3.770642201834862

I've asked my friends if they remembered such a movie and they just looked at me like I was crazy.  I was sure I must have just made it up.  I was so excited when my brother remembered this movie and put a name to it.  I can' wait to own it, too bad it's not on DVD though.",1186963200,,405,3.6744186046511627

LOL They used to show it here in the July/August school holidays with a lot of other teen-y movies and TV shows like Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Flour Babies, Degrassi High, Square Pegs and Rags to Riches (THAT's another one other people think I've made up but I'm off to go look for it...)

Even though I haven't seen it in over 15 years, I still remember 2 scenes in particular...the one where his wig comes off when he's playing football (soccer to the Yanks :) and the one where his friend is sitting in back of him in class snipping away at his ever growing locks...too funny. They really should get this out on DVD",1180224000,,711,4.3059701492537314
596486,5,6303213936,"This is some sort of childhood movie de ja vu that has creeped me out for years.  My younger brother and I are 15 months apart and very close and we always bring up the movie about the boy who loses his hair and they spread peanut butter on his head to grow it back.  For a long time I didn't know the name of the movie, so I went typing every possible thing I could remember into google until the title comes up.  I was so surprised that so many people thought it was a dream too.  You don't know how many times I would ask my mother about that movie and how she never remembered the title either.  Now that I'm pushing 25, I'm going to go and buy this movie for myself and send a copy to my brother.  This is awesome, in a weird, crazy, twisted sort of way.",1178496000,2,759,3.9281045751633985

596488,4,6303213936,"This is amazing...!  I thought that I had this vivid dream from the 80s when I was a child that this little boy was kidnapped and his hair was made into paintbrushes and I remember it all being about peanut butter.  Then I was talking to a friend in college and he said, ""Yeah, that's the Peanut Butter Solution!""  I couldn't believe it!  I haven't seen the movie as an adult yet, but I will start looking for a copy.  There should be some sort of group for all of us who have had this experience.",1178236800,2,497,4.135416666666667
596499,4,6303213936,"I too was one of those victims who thought that the plot of this movie was fabricated in a dream of mine as a child, but while talking about it with a roommate of mine, I realized that, no, it was in fact a real movie that scarred me for life.  I used to dream about losing my hair and putting peanut butter on my head to help with grow back and then my hair was stolen to make paint brushes.  I went through about a ten year span where I couldn't think about even smelling peanut butter because it freaked me out so much.  After reading others' reviews, I kind of want to go back and see the movie again, but it's near impossible to find!  Also, my roommate won't even talk about it because she still has nightmares about it.  This movie needs to have a comeback so I can see it again and get over my fear of peanut butter and paint brushes.  If I think about it, I have never allowed myself to have long hair and it's probably due to the nightmares I have had from this not-so-scarey but psychologically scarring movie.",1177372800,4,1021,4.157360406091371
596500,5,6303213936,"I loved this movie as a kid. I started thinking about it years later and really wanted to see it again. I bought a new copy and it was even better than I remembered. I showed it to several friends and they were all totally blown away by it. Eventually I loaned it to a friend who lost it and now my copy is gone. I have contemplated purchasing this movie again because I really want to watch it again -- I also have several friends whom I have talked this movie up to, who don't believe it as good as I say it is -- and most of all I would just really love to have this movie in my collection...however...I can't bring myself to pay $30-$40 for a used vhs copy (all that seems to be available) of a movie that I have already purchased once. Come to think of it, I don't even have a functioning video cassette player at the moment, so I couldn't even play a vhs copy of this movie.

596501,5,6303213936,I too haven't found anyone who has seen this movie but I just thought that was because I live in New Zealand and it wasn't as common here.  I Remember it very well from when I was young and always thought it was brilliant but very scary.  I went to my local video store a few months ago to ask if they had it and they were very suprised that they did and told me that it had not been rented for about 10 years.

Fortunatly I found someone who knew what I was talking about and also knew the title. This movie was great as a kid.  I remember him running through the yards being chased by dogs and his hair getting caught on bushes.

I was really surprised to find it on Amazon and even more surprised that people are remembering it the same way as me! It definitely terrified me as a kid and I thought that I must have remembered the plot all wrong, it didn't seem possible for someone to make a movie about a kid getting so scared he loses his hair then grows it back with peanut butter.

Myself, I thought the plot of the movie was a nightmare i had. I actually thought my 'nightmare' had been a movie that i had recalled, but recounting my nightmare to people they said there was no way that was a kids movie.

Then, I have a friend tell me about this movie, and like many evidentally, It freaked me out to realize it WAS a film, and I hadn't just made it up.

This movie from what i remember is bizarre, to say the least but has made an impression on almost every kid who saw it. Not your normal kids movie.

Oddly enough directed by the guy who made the landmark documentary Waiting for Fidel.

When I asked people was called and they would tell me that no such movie existed and that I had dreamed it.

After searching and searching I finally found the Peanut Butter Solution and knew I had not dreamed it after all.

so many people are used to see the same stories about the children movies: stuped and typical situatios, and a so linear screenplay.
i showed the movie to five of my cousins (5,6 and 8 years old) and they loved it!

I was trying to look up another movie called ""midnight madness"" that i had only seen once and thought hey what the heck see if they have that peanut butter movie. So i looked up the word peanut butter and there it was ""the peanut butter solution""

the only thing i really remember was that this kid put some peanut butter on his head and remember it growing really really long. once scene i really remember is where the kid is in bed and he has to tie his hair up because it kept getting in the way it looked like he had an onion on his head.

Honestly, I'd rather have had nightmares about getting sucked up by the tv than about this freaky, freaky movie.

Pretty much all I can remember is that there's some kid who makes some peanut butter-poison mix in his blender, and right before he's about to put it on his hair, his dad walks in and slaps it out of his hand because he thinks the kid wants to drink it and kill himself.  Then there's some factory with little bald kids (did they have cancer?  I never knew for sure) and they're all subdued and miserable.  Something with paintbrushes...then something else with maybe a witch? (there's no way to be sure).

So long story short, I vividly recall ejecting the tape from our VCR and smashing it to pieces with my brother.  We might have set it aflame, too.  Please don't ever buy this movie...your kids will never recover.  I still freak out a little when I think about it.

But anyway, all I ever remembered about this movie was how much it troubled my friend and me, because no one we knew had ever seen it, and we had no idea where to find it. I can't believe how many others have had the same thing happen to them with this movie.

Our visiting professor, Robert Morgan was out of town, and resident Fiction professor, William Hallberg was running the shop.  We were discussing another student's work, when suddenly a discussion about hair came up.  I mentioned that the serial killer could make paintbrushes out of hair, and another student responded with ""like The Peanut Butter Solution.""  It was like a divine revealation had been given to me.

You see, I've been searching for this film since I was about six.  Unfortunately, no one has ever known what I was talking about.  Now I feel complete and this film will be on my birthday list, despite the fact that I am now 22!

It could be 6, 7 in the morning and no one is up, just you, lying in bed and going over the things in your mind.  And sometimes you'll discover memories, bits and pieces, of something and the more you try to get a better grasp of it, the more it dissolves.  Memory is funny that way.

I saw this movie when I was younger and it has haunted me ever since.  I would see bits and pieces, flashes of scenes, emotions of fear and happiness from things in this movie I could not for the life of me remember.  But they were there.  And everytime i tried to describe what I felt to someone, they would shake their heads and sadly say I imagined this or they've never heard of it.  Well, I finally figured out the name of this film and there is a part of me that is complete.  It's hard to put into words what it's like to remember something that no one else doesn't, especially at that age when someone's acknowledgement would have meant so much.

I just turned 24 and i think there are many others in my age bracket that have seen this movie and can't quite remember what it was.  I hope they figure it out one day and come across this review on Amazon and know that they were not alone, that those memories were real, and there are others out there like them.  And should you ever see this movie again and relive certain moments, just remember those summer days when you would wake up and hear thunder outside.

The weird thing is, I had been looking for it too!  As I'm trying to hunt down a copy for him for Christmas, I come here and find that all the reviews written are by people expressing the same awe that I felt about this movie...trippy movie from childhood...stuck in my head...paintbrushes made from hair...etc.

This movie is a typical bizarre, spooky, borderline scary, 70's/80's movie.  I don't know what the obsession was of making acid trippy kids movies was back in those days, but this definitely falls in that category.  The entrancing plot might be a little frightening or intense for kids UNDER the age of ten.  I was right around ten when it came out and I found it creepy yet intriguing, not scary.  To kind of gauge it, it's comparable to the darker Harry Potter movies, or the trippy 70's Krofft shows, or as someone else mentioned, Return to Oz (which was considerably darker than the original).  I do highly recommend The Peanut Butter Solution, as movies with plots that really stick with you over the years like this one are rarely made these days.",1101686400,11,1231,4.640552995391705

However, I had no idea what movie it was from until my friend said, ""Do you remember that movie, 'The Peanut Butter something'""?  I freaked out and we searched the Internet til we found it.  I hadn't thought about the name of the movie in SO long.  Then I realized it had the scene I remembered:  the toilet paper hanging off the stick so as to not wake the mean old guy with the invisible strings attached to rings on his knuckles while he slept!

596576,1,6303213936,"Great for adults, a hot skillet for a child's brain.

First, there's a line where Michael is digging dirt for the ""solution"" in his back yard, and his father (spying on him in a darkened room with his older daughter) says ""I've heard that pregnant women crave earth.""  So, the question is:  What kind of movie tells little children that expectant mothers eat dirt?

There is a bit of charm to this film, like the magic paintings that come to life and the crabby ghosts, but there are also things to fry young minds.  The Signor, the art teacher, creates a politically correct (multiculural) child labor based sweat shop in an abandonned warehouse to make magic brushes from the carcinogetic head of hair that Michael has grown.

Also, let's not forget where the neighbor lad, Conrad decides to put the ""solution"" for his prospective hair results (yes, down there...)

I suppose this is a great film for older kids, and a great redeux for adults scarred by this film earlier in life.  Celine Dion does her best Laura Branagan immitation for the soundtrack, and we learn a little bit about life in Montreal in the 1980s.

Showing this too the smaller members of your family will assure weeks of nightmares, bedwetting and perhaps costy psychological analysis down the road.

She new EXACTLY what I was talking about, and filled in the blanks about the machine and the painting.  It creeped her out too, but she was wanting to see it again to see if it was a scary as she remembers.  So I got a copy for her birthday, just for memories sake.

What I find creepy is that, like so many others here, the movie has lingered with me for years though my memories had little to do with any kind of coherent plot.  I had memories of the kids making paintbrushes and the protagonist's fast-growing hair, to say nothing of the extreme weirdness and creep-factor in this movie.  Like so many others, it is a huge relief to actually find this movie and at some point I will probably purchase and watch it again just to see how accurate my memories are.  My rating here is based on what little I remember of the movie and the strong fascination that I've had with it over at least two decades.

I would compare it, in terms of strangeness, to a kids' version of ""Eraserhead"".  It also reminds me of a story Roald Dahl might have written at some point, or of the result of an H.P. Love craft movie for children (admittedly, not among his more unsettling works, but it would definitely rank as ""weird"", based entirely on my memory of the movie from decades ago).

I was talking about old TV shows and movies with this girl at work and this movie came up. I was floored when she actually knew what I was talking about! We have since tried to explain the movie to others at the office and, like everyone else here, receive nothing but strange looks. She will flip out when she sees I got this for her birthday! She will be 34......soul-mate? I think so!",1361664000,2,525,4.0576923076923075
7840993,5,6303213936,"All I can say right now is that I'm speechless! I was just sitting with a coworker of mine and we were talking about weird movies and having crazy imaginations/dreams when we were kids, and I went ahead and told her about a movie I SWEAR I saw that I have repeatedly told friends and family about but NO ONE believed me. I had a very vivid imagination as a kid so when I mentioned a movie where a little boy goes through some sort of house where he comes out with a bald head and can only remedy his problem by smearing peanut butter on it before his mom finds out, of course everyone assumed it was another one of my crazy dreams. But I was certain it was real - I remember the actors' faces, and how it made me feel afterwards (to the point where I obviously remember it 20 years later).
I assumed I would always wonder about that movie, and be content with everyone thinking I'm crazy - until my coworker convinced me to try and Google it. I had actually thought of that before but assumed it would be a ridiculous idea - what would I Google, ""bald head kid + peanut butter + movie""?? But she told me to do just that and give it a shot, and lo and behold - not only does the movie exist but there are others just like me!!! Other children of the 80s who were assumed crazy, with vague memories of this strange story, but were afraid to look it up until now.
Whoever suggested there be  ""Peanut Butter Solution Watchers Anonymous"" - I'm all for it!  Of the 25+ people I've mentioned this movie to over the decades, no one knew what I was talking about..so it would be nice to reminisce and pop in the VHS together:)",1315440000,,1617,4.1629392971246

When I gave it to him recently, the look of excitement and happiness on his face absolutely made my heart melt. Thank you so much for having this, I was unable to find it anywhere else! <3",1313625600,,329,4.238095238095238
