8685155,5,B00OWAIKWY,We like all Jeff Chandler's movies - ie Raw Wind in Eden which was very enjoyable and Lady Takes a Flyer but particularly we want to buy TOY TIGER with Jeff Chandler - this was always one of our favourite movies and the little boy was very good.  Please tell us when you will release it and we will definitely buy it as a dvd.,1514160000,,326,4.015384615384615
8685156,5,B00OWAIKWY,"RAW WIND IN EDEN is one of my favorite films. This is a highly overlooked film. Jeff Chandler really makes this film believable as the mysterious playboy stranger who has dropped out from conventional society and is now leading a bohemian lifestyle on an isolated Mediterranean island. This film is colorful,upbeat and has certain thought provoking attraction suggesting that there is more to life than living a mundane existence in a modern world of concrete and steel and endless martinis. Enzo Serafin's cinematography is lush and vibrant and truly enhances the overall experience of RAW WIND IN EDEN.",1476576000,,604,5.173469387755102
