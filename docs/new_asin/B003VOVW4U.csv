8406949,4,B003VOVW4U,"This Blu-Ray 2 pack was Mill Creek Entertainment's initial attempt to step into the Blu-Ray Format.  Well, it's a good first attempt.  The 2 films, Demonic & Uninvited, are more modern day low budget films.  While not great, they are far from the worst I have ever seen.  So it is a worthwhile buy for the price",1446681600,,311,4.4035087719298245
8406950,1,B003VOVW4U,"Advertising and product quality seems to be an issue for Amazon to control. This sad for me because as a disabled person, I depend on what you, Amazon say about the product, but most every movie I've bought was supposed to be new but wasn't? This makes me very hesitant in the future. Sadly I've bought hundreds of bluray movies and a lot of DVDs.",1426809600,,347,4.3538461538461535
8406951,1,B003VOVW4U,"This is the worst blu ray i have ever purchased.
The quality is atrocious. It is VCD quality and something I have not seen for a long time.
I watched the first few mins and I forward to the next movie hoping it will be better but both movies are of the same grainy quality.
I am very disappointed that amazon sells something like this.",1322784000,2,335,4.1692307692307695
8406952,3,B003VOVW4U,"Ok; grade c movies are a like of mine, they are always awkward and not so well done, usually with a certain bit of ineptness. People often call these very small budget movies 'b movies' but they are wrong.  ""Amusement' is a b movie , these are c  movies done with lower film stock quality, very inexperienced actors usually, on way lower budgets than a b movie has. Although Jack ELam was a great actor who was in many A movies, he makes the second movie alot better than it would be without him. these are one star movies though.
(d movies are some local guy with his camera etc) however a few d's are really good by any standard! And lots of c movies are great imo but these aren't great movies, these are bad c movies and yet I still enjoy them because I collect horror. And thank goodness they are on blu ray , I wish everything was on blu ray ,  even poor film stock looks better on blu ray and you get two c movies here for a cheap price. Major studios are ripping us off by not putting two movies on a blu ray I think. They can charge way less on older titles too and make money and get most of their old catalogs out on blu eventually. Why not? Even poorly made c horror flicks can shine in their badness on blu ray. Back to the movies, I have tons of c and d movie horror movies in my collection so this one was  a welcome addition to my collection. A non c movie horror fan might not want this blu ray but at this price it's worth getting I would say. If you like c movies and just want a few cheapo horror flicks to while away the time,  and collect lots of c movies then this one is for you. If you are not a collector of c movie horror movies and expecting them to be well made and such then you will not be happy with these flicks. However at this price it's worth it nonthelesss.  U
I give this set a three star because we get two bad c movies on a blu ray disc.  These are bad movies like most c horror movies so a regular non fan may give these movies a ONE STAR. Three stars for giving me two bad c horror cheapos on one blu ray and two stars for the movies or less maybe! But I dig one star cheapo horror if you don't then, well what did you expect?",1293840000,,2168,3.9473684210526314
8406953,2,B003VOVW4U,"This is a pretty sorry collection of half-hearted half-@$$ed films. Little effort was put into making these movies entertaining and you can probably have more fun making shadow puppets on your kitchen wall. The presence of Jack Elam lifts this stink fest from one to two stars.

DEMONIC: This movie is also known as Forest of the Damned.  It has one interesting, original kernal of a good idea but it is handled with major ineptitude. Basically a group of kids decides to take a trip in the woods. There they meet some beautiful, nekked bi-sexual woman who are also nymphomaniac angels who've been kicked out of heaven. Now you're thinking, there is no way anyone could screw this premise up, right? Well..... Let's just say that if it weren't for the gorgeous woman cavorting around this movie would be intolerably boring. You can see plenty of naked women and for free on the interwebs. I will say that if anyone ever remakes this movie with the attention to story and FX that it deserves, you could have yourself a sweet little gem of a film.

UNINVITED: I'm a huge fan of the Western/Horror movie and I don't think there are anywhere near enough good
representatives of this subgenre. This movie does not help things. True, Jack Elam is a great scary old codger and if I could see this for free I might just fast forward through every thing but his scenes. The rest of the movie is pretty bland. A bunch of strangers throw in together and pool their money to buy a gold mine on top of a mountain. They end up having to fight their own inner demons and each other as the opportunity for gold brings out the ""monster"" within them. It's pretty tired stuff. The scares are less than minimal and the acting, except for Elam, is marginal at best. If you want to see the very best Western version of this story, what greed can do to human beings, check out The Treasure of Sierra Madre.",1288224000,5,1883,4.5
