539857,5,6303049044,"Shirley Temple and Jane Withers are a dynamic duo together as Shirley plays a orphaned child that everybody wishes to adopt and Jane plays a selfish brat who has no compassion for Shirley or anybody else.  This movie is simply hysterical with the rude Joy (Jane Withers)and the funny and political Uncle Ned.  I have never laughed as much as I did in any other Shirley Temple film!  Shirley sings her trade mark song ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"" and will dazzle you with her charm.  The plot of the story is easy for young children to follow and consists of tear jerkers, hysterical moments, and dramatic scenes.  I have to say this movie wouldn't receive 5 stars without Jane Withers!",980035200,7,684,4.619834710743802
539858,5,6303049044,"This is certainly one of the top Temple films.  I only have one difficulty with the film, but it's not one that lessens the quality; indeed, I would argue that it enhances it!  It is the following: ""You mean-- my mommy  cracked up too?!""  A medium pause as he turns to look at Shirley  (smiling, if you can believe it!!) ""Yeaahhsh"".  A brilliant, if  not slightly disturbing addition, to an already brilliant film.",933552000,,414,4.589041095890411

539950,4,6303049044,"Bright Eyes is one of the few Shirley Temple films available in Japan and I guess it is a good movie to start to find out about the charm of Shirley Temple one of the legendary child actors during 1930s and 40s. In Japan it is also the name of one of the most popular children clothes brands in Japan. The film is best known by the Good Ship Lollipop one of the most popular dance songs for small children. This film typifies the films during 30s in which Shirley play a great part. Main plot is man and woman and Shirley an adorable girl often serves as the agent to link them together. It is a nice family film. Recent version has colorized version. Though it is not that done good, maybe it is ok for casual viewers.",1462924800,,719,4.179856115107913

539996,5,6303049044,"This is Shirley Temple at her best, and although, it is her first movie, she is fantastic.  An interesting aspect of the movie is that much of it was shot at the Glendale Grand Central Air Terminal, in Glendale a suburb of Los Angeles.  The art deco terminal features prominently in many scenes. Many people do not know that this was the principal airport for Los Angeles before the present LAX was built on the coast.  If you are in LA now, you can stop and see the terminal.  The runways are covered with commercial buildings, but the terminal and the hangars are there. The hangars are now warehouses.  The site of the former airport is located just off the I5 at the Western exit.  Old movies show Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindberg landing there.  When you see Shirley singing On the Good Ship Lollipop, you may not know that she is skipping down the isle of a DC-2.  Another feature of the film is the heavy rainstorm.  Anyone who knows LA knows that it hardly ever rains there, especially that hard. Other movies that feature rain in LA include Singin' in the Rain and LA Confidential.",1436227200,,1093,4.50761421319797

Since I have not seen all of her movies I am in no position to say for sure. However this can be said: It is a very entertaining and enjoyable little film.

540077,5,6303049044,This video is an aviation classic beginning with an overview of various aircraft from the early 30's.  The culture of this period is also very interesting.  A careful assessment of most Shirley Temple movies show horrible events happening to a child that constitutes grave child endangerment and neglect by today's standards.  This video has the childs mother being killed in an accident and the child being orphaned.  The myth of a pilot bailing out while holding onto a child or a dog is also shown.  Most people who have done this will tell you that it doesn't work.  The object being held usually gets ripped away by the parachute opening shock.,1349049600,,649,4.801801801801802
540078,3,6303049044,"This is one of those Shirley Temple movies you've probably seen on TV several times. It's one of her best, and the one where she sings ""On the Good Ship Lollipop."" She's quite young and quite cute, but old enough to be articulate. It's not just an engaging sentimental script, it's catching Shirley at just the right age.

Shirley Blake is crazy about airplanes and pilots. Her father was one, and he was killed awhile back. Her mother is now a maid in some nasty rich people's home, and she is the pet of the fliers at the local airport. Her godfather (James Dunn) adores her and indulges her, but she's not spoiled. She's a cheerful little thing, and everyone loves her.

Except Mr. and Mrs. Smyth and their brat of a daughter. Their uncle, Mr. Smith (the younger ones changed their name to sound more aristocratic), who is in a wheelchair, is only tolerated because he is expected to leave his money to the Smyths. Their daughter, ironically named Joy, pesters and torments the old man unmercifully. But Shirley is nice to him, and he grows fond of her. When her mother is hit by a car and killed, Mr. Smith wants to adopt her. But so does her godfather.

How the issue is resolved was so sensible the audience could see it coming a mile away, but it was still fun to watch the Smyths, including Joy, make total asses of themselves.",1337040000,,1335,4.463114754098361

540125,4,6303049044,"Even though there is very little singing and dancing, which is a big part of the appeal of Shirley Temple, it's still a solid film.

This was the first movie in which was Shirley was the big star, I believe, and you can see why she quickly won the hearts of Americans.

Although there is only one song, it's perhaps her most famous: ""On the Good Ship Lollipop."" The rest of the film is almost as charming as that song with many sweet, touching moments that made her films so endearing.

It also helped to have James Dunn as the male lead. Dunn was one of the more likable guys in classic Hollywood, on and off the screen. He and Shirley make a great pair.

Other interesting people to watch in this movie are the crabby old grandfather, played by Charles Sellon; the spoiled brat played by Jane Withers, who is so bad she's funny and an assortment of other characters from fliers to cooks to old girlfriends.

The only negative is the ending. It looked like they didn't know how to end this, so they rushed to finish it without much thought. Oh, well, the main thing is Shirley's charm.....and that's there in abundance.",1233532800,,1120,4.443902439024391
540126,5,6303049044,"My three grandchildren thoroughly enjoyed ""meeting"" Shirley Temple via the film, ""Bright Eyes"".  They're all singing the song ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"" Jackie Jackowitz, Andover, New Jersey",1202774400,,191,5.821428571428571
540127,5,6303049044,"Shirley Temple shines in her starring role as Shirley Blake in Bright Eyes. Only six years old when the film was made, Temple stole the hearts of millions of Americans and provided them with great entertainment to get people through the hard times of the depression.

The action begins when Shirley is hitchhiking to the local airport so she can spend time with her godfather James 'Loop' Merritt (James Dunn). Once Shirley arrives at the airport it becomes clear that she's the little darling of all the aviators there. They even plan a Christmas party especially just for Shirley! Unfortunately, things aren't going well for Shirley's widowed mother, Mary Blake (Lois Wilson). She works as a maid for the snobby and snotty well off Anita and J. Wellington Smythe (Dorothy Christy and Theodore von Eltz, respectively). Even their spoiled brat daughter Joy (Jane Withers) treats Shirley like dirt. Through it all, however, Shirley stays focused on the good things in her life like ""Loop"" and her mother.

Things change fast when Shirley's mother dies unexpectedly. A custody battle quickly ensues. The crusty, rich old uncle of the Smythe's, Ned Smith (Charles Sellon) shows his softie inner self when he becomes determined to adopt Shirley Blake for himself. He knows Shirley is the only person who loves him; the Smythe's just humor Ned Smith to stay in Ned Smith's will. On the other hand, ""Loop,"" Shirley's godfather, wants Shirley so badly that even in a bad storm he takes off in his plane for New York to earn money for the court battle.

Of course, the plot has a few twists and turns--although nothing terribly radical ensues. Who will win the custody battle at the end of the court scene? What about Joy Smythe--will she succeed at hurting Shirley's feelings--and pushing Shirley down during their game of ""train wreck?"" Will the Smythe's be able to talk Ned Smith into letting Shirley go to a home for orphaned children? What about ""Loop"" in his plane during that fantastic storm--will he make it to New York safely? Watch the movie and find out!

The choreography works well in crowded scenes including the courtroom scene and the scene in which Shirley sings ""On The Good Ship Lollipop."" The cinematography shines in scenes during the storm when ""Loop"" flies in plane in bad weather.

The DVD offers you a choice between watching this film in black or white or a colorized version. There are three trailers for other Shirley Temple movies but that's about it.

Overall, Bright Eyes truly made Shirley Temple the star that she remains today. I highly recommend this film for Shirley Temple fans; it is a good, solid family film. James Dunn turns in a stunning performance as ""Loop,"" Shirley's godfather; and look for some great acting by a very young Jane Withers as Joy Smythe, too.

Enjoy!",1191715200,3,2803,4.863731656184487

There are only a hand full of her films that I will always remember and this is one of them. Heidi,Curly Top and The Little Colonel were the others. The DVD has both Black and White and Colorized version. I am not a fan of colorizing anything,but since they kept the original intact, I did enjoy watching both.",1174867200,,475,4.348314606741573

What's nice about this DVD is that you have the option of watching it in black and white or color.  My daughter often asks to watch ""the gray one""!!!  It's a cute movie but obviously dated.

540131,5,6303049044,"Shirly Temple started early in films and at age six was a box office sensation where even Santa Claus wanted her autograph.  My wife's great grandmother stated that Shirley got her through the depression.  I can believe it.  Shirley is an idealistic child that finds her way through unbelievable odds without ever shedding a tear or even a pout.  The plots are all the same.  Shirley starts off with either being an orphan or will be one when her parents (or parent) inevidably dies in the film giving Shirley that sad crying scene.  The death sequence is always after a peppy musical number where everything just seems great at the time.  The rest of the film finds Shirley trapped with vial caretakers who find her worthless and a burden (sort of an Oliver Twist scenario).  Naturally there is always someone there to rescue her from the cruelty that she endures and finds herself off into the sunset with a new father or mother who is as idealistic as one can be.  Throughout Shirley endures and provides us with whimsical and lively facial expressions that will break your heart.  You feel manipulated and don't care because Shirley is a master with the camera.  Bright Eyes is one of her best and of course includes ""The Good Ship"" song that's in many ways her signature piece.",1155859200,3,1282,4.678571428571429
540132,4,6303049044,"The year was 1934. America was wheeling from the devastation of the Great Depression and economic woes. Then came a young actress that helped bring movie patrons back to theatres and also helped an upcoming studio that nearly faced bankruptcy. Shirley Temple was just six years old when she made nearly eight feature films in 1934,but the most beloved and well made of those eight was her second Fox feature film ""Bright Eyes"" and it definitely shows!

""Bright Eyes"" is the simple story of a young girl (Temple) who ends up becoming fascinated with her aviator stepdad pilot (James Dunn) and also facing the hardships of life such as death,adoption and her unquestionable future. Her life is combined with that of a rich family named the Smythe's and their bratty daughter (Jane Withers) and her stepdad's friends. But when tragedy strikes Shirley's mom,it brings her and her stepdad closer than ever. Directed by David Butler and featuring Temple's signature song ""On The Good Ship Lollipop"",and a standout hilarious performance by Withers,""Bright Eyes"" is definitely at times sad,but hilarious,and enjoyable film that has a strong central story mixed with comedy and child-like mischief that will appeal to any family member and adults old or new. Recommended for all !

ABOUT THE DVD:
Originally released as part of a short-lived three movie collection of Temple's films to DVD in 2002,it's easy to see why this version is such a big improvement over the '02 release. This version has been digitally restored to its original black & white version with very few specks,dirt,and contrast boosting that plagued the earlier DVD version and also the main intrusion of this new DVD is a brand-new,digitally restored,and enhanced colorized version. The '02 release simply took a lousy-looking and poor color version done in the late '80's and the results were just poor and unnatural-looking compared to today's technology. Speaking of which,this new color version was produced by Legend Films as with previous new Temple DVD releases and the new technology brings out the film's color appeal than the previous incarnation. Purists will definitely stick to the original restored b&w and very little extras (hence the four star rating) round out the disc. All you get is an unrestored trailer for ""Heidi"" and a trailer for ""Little Miss Broadway"" which is missing its text and narration (note that the two same trailers both appear on most of the recent Fox Temple DVD's).Finally,Fox has put out a very decent and well-deserved presentation of one of Shirley's best-loved films and far superior to the version beforehand. Highly recommended for classic film buffs and fans alike !",1150156800,15,2674,5.116704805491991
540133,4,6303049044,"BRIGHT EYES was Shirley Temple's first big movie, tailored especially for her, in which she plays the darling of a group of aviators.  Shirley Blake (Temple) is a little tomboy who loves to hang around the airport with her pilot godfather `Loop' (James Dunn).  Her widowed mother Mary (Lois Wilson) works as a maid to the snooty Smythe family, where Shirley must contend with bratty Joy (Jane Withers).  When an horrific accident leaves Shirley orphaned, `Loop' sets out to adopt her but soon discovers he is only one of many who want to take home the adorable moppet.

Shirley shines in her first big role.  After proving her mettle in ""Baby Take a Bow"" and many short subjects for the ""Baby Burlesques"" series, she was more than ready to tackle her first emotionally challenging part.  Jane Withers is hilarious as the antithesis to Shirley's sweetness (""There ain't no Santy Claus, `cause my psychoanalyst told me"").

This film also introduced Temple's signature tune ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"".  The DVD includes the computer-coloured version of the film.",1137974400,3,1060,4.982954545454546
540134,5,6303049044,"This is simply the best Shirley Temple film ever! This film includes Shirley's best known song ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"". I love everything about this film, especially any of the scene with Shirley and Jane Withers. Jane Withers does a fantastic job as the spoiled rotten Joyce. Of course, James Dunn is in the film, this time as a friend of Shirley's father who passed away. The film centers around Shirley and her mother who works as a maid in a rich household. Shirley's mom is still friends with the pilots that knew her husband and the rich family does not like the pilots to visit. Tragedy happens. To say much more would ruin the film. The film is rated PG because of the tragedy.

It is a must see if you are a Temple fan. It has adorable Shirley at her best, a funny antagonist ( Jane Withers), and singing. This is a must buy if you are wanting to start a Shirley Temple Collection.",1135036800,,894,4.3532934131736525

This a sweet movie(as all of Shirley's are) in which Shirley's father an aviator has passed away when Shirley's mom is hit by car. Shirley becomes admist a custody battle between an  rich elderly man that loves Shirley, her father's best friend, and a lady. In the end as always there is a happy ending.

""Bright Eyes"" in my opinon is the best Shirley Temple film for it's one of those films you leave feeling happy. This is great for the kiddies, Shirley fans, and family movie night.

Don't miss out on a Shirley Temple treasure!",1106611200,2,708,4.465116279069767

540212,4,6303049044,"It's about time these early Shirley Temple films are being reissued on DVD. Yes, ""The Little Pincess"" has been on DVD for years but up to now that has been the only one available. This is the first of three films released by Fox Studios (Heidi & Dimples being the other two) and while I am happy it is on DVD the picture quality is a BIG disappointment. Maybe because it was made earlier than other Temple films (1934) the graininess really shows through. In this case, it isn't much better than VHS, and that is sad. Perhaps, the original film negative is in poor shape but Fox probably could have done better. So, while I am ecstatic that Shirley Temple (the greatest child film star EVER) is getting her due on DVD, I am disappointed that the quality of this release isn't better. However, it still is better than VHS, but not by much. By the way, the ""Heidi"" DVD is much better, in both picture quality and story, but ""Bright Eyes"" is a great movie by a great little actress.",1014163200,8,979,4.384615384615385
540213,4,6303049044,"...when you find out that Shirley's trademark song, ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"" premieres in this movie, not on a boat, but on an airplane! Shirley's aviator dad was killed in a crash before the movie begins, but his best pal James Dunn is still very much on the scene and in her life. Darling Shirley and her mom live in the home of some rich folks, for whom Mom is the maid. They are an unhappy family for all their money, with a bratty daughter (played to perfection by future Josephine the Plumber Jane Withers) and a cantankerous old wheelchair-bound uncle. Things take a spin when Shirley's mother is struck by a hit and run driver en route to Shirley's birthday party. The ensuing custody battle is wrapped up just about as you might expect.
""Bright Eyes"" is a very good children's movie, and like so many of Shirley's movies, treats the topic of death with sensitivity--we know the mother has died because we see the birthday cake ornament, a little plane, is broken by the side of the curb. There's a neat scene also when Shirley and Dunn (and a puppy dog) have to bail out of a plane via parachute--that should really brighten the eyes of your little ones!",1008806400,13,1166,4.504716981132075

But get out your hankie or Kleenex before you view it.  You will need it.
Rewind and watch her sing this song again.  And again, and again...You'll never get tired!",1006732800,,278,4.411764705882353
540215,3,6303049044,"This was the first movie actually crafted just for Shirley and the kids should find it a fun diversion, even today. It's in this movie in which Temple sings her famed version of ON THE GOOD SHIP LOLLIPOP - while on an airplane!  The supporting cast includes the little seen silent screen actress Lois Wilson who plays Shirley's  mother (employed as a maid) and the talented Irishman, James Dunn - he won an Oscar for the happy alcoholic singing waiter in A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN - does well as Shirley's kind uncle. Cheeky Jane Withers (Remember Josephine, the plumber who endorsed Comet cleanser in the sixties?) plays Joy, and she's fun in contrast to Shirley's goody-goody personna- she's wild, mischievous, noisy, jealous, messy, angry and not particularly cute; she was eventually ranked second in popularity to Temple as a thirties female child star. Recommended for the little ones because these Temple films are inoffensive (with very few exceptions) and are expertly computer colourized!",1004227200,8,997,5.073170731707317

Shirley is in a  3 waycustody battle & she wants them all. Jane Withers (Joy) is a hilarous addon to the movie and she doesn't have any compassion for anyone not even her own two parents and not even't dear little Shirley.
