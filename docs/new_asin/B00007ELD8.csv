1807626,5,B00007ELD8,This was a great movie.  A serious eye opener for all those who think they can't get AIDS.  This movie will leave you with a lot to think about.  The actors played their parts very well. I highly recommend this movie.,1110326400,16,217,4.2439024390243905
1807627,5,B00007ELD8,"I have to say that this movie was one of the best black movies that i have ever seen in my life. It gave you a real account of how people actually live day to day, and i really liked that about the movie. The details in the movie really made it pop!! This movie was a major eye opener to me and i recommend that all young people see this movie. It had me reflecting for about an hour afterwards. Also, the fact that is was set in Chicago made it even better, if you are not from chicago the slang and the places might be hard to understand but it is still a good movie!! BUY THIS MOVIE !!!",1100736000,16,589,3.87603305785124
1807628,1,B00007ELD8,"A rather drab, slowly edited/paced and elementarily acted piece that put me to sleep with its predictability.  Shows like a boring issue-based student film - only most student films last about 30 minutes, whereas this one drags on for an hour and a half.",1090454400,4,254,4.7727272727272725
1807629,4,B00007ELD8,"I thought the movie was very thought-provoking.  I spent another hour or so after watching this just imagining being in the predicament of the main characters.  It inspired lots of conversation and I guess thats a good thing.  You won't recognize anyone in the film unless you are from Chicago *wink wink* but it had an equal share of laughs, irony, realness and seriousness. It made me think of the movie Kids on another level but the message is still there in black or white.",1084406400,9,477,4.588235294117647
1807630,4,B00007ELD8,This movie is an excellent way to show young teenager the reality of AIDS.  This movie shows the two sides of the African- American culture.  The so-call player and working black man and their decisions for their life.  This movie demonstrates no one is invisible from AIDS.,1076284800,4,274,4.787234042553192
1807631,5,B00007ELD8,"If you have anyone who feels that HIV and AIDS is not a serious issue,well, you need to get a copy of this movie quick,fast and pronto. I have heard of this movie,but wasn't able to see it until last week when it came on Cable,and despite the cussing,despite the rawness(which is needed)it was a great flick. It should be in everyone's library.",1074556800,34,344,4.476190476190476
1807632,4,B00007ELD8,"Excellent and thought-provoking movie.  Superb dialogue.  This movie definitely keeps it real and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The actors are believable, and the movie doesn't come across as preachy like most films about HIV and AIDS. With the right budget and backing from the major industry players, this could have been the ""Boyz in the Hood"" of it's genre. This movie should be shown to every teen/young adult and used as a public service.  See this movie and then give it to a friend.",1072051200,5,497,4.613636363636363

1807635,5,B00007ELD8,I have never been so moved by a movie in my adult life.  It was so intense I could barely speak afterwards.  It's about a guy who is scheduled to marry a girl on Saturday and just found out the Monday before his wedding that some other girl he slept with a while back is HIV positive and admitted to having sex with the soon to be groom.  On Monday he was tested and has one week to find out the results.  You wouldn't believe what happens during that One week.  Please veiw this this film!!!!,1047600000,7,493,4.09375

1807700,5,B00007ELD8,This movie was a eye opener for a great deal of people living in this world and not taking full responsibility for their sexual actions. My suggestion to people all over the universe is to take care of yourself and know who you are sleeping with. It's the woman responsibility to make sure a man has protection and I put that on everything. If women knew how some men are with their inhibitions and men knew the same then protection would be on their minds as soon as they lay down. Watch this movie.,1380931200,,500,4.329787234042553
1807701,5,B00007ELD8,This movie is a HIV/AIDS wake up call. What we do and don't do will affect others. I wish the film would of had a larger budget and explored in more detail. I give it 5 stars because of the message. Wake up. The only safer sex is in a committed long term relationship. True safe sex is no sex at all.,1380499200,,300,3.8548387096774195

1807727,1,B00007ELD8,"I am sure that the producers wanted to portray a serious issue. However, all the expletives and the continuous use of the N word made me upset about 10 minutes in. I am so tired of the emphasis that movies tend to make on the negative aspect of African American culture. I wish that they did not have the ""actors"" (they are not so good) cursing at every second. If the cursing and slurs are your thing, then go ahead and watch it. However I am a proud and conscious black lady and I can not promote such a movie.",1368748800,,512,4.13

1807757,5,B00007ELD8,"Wow. I'm writing my comments after just watching the film and I feel overwhelmed with emotion. This is one of the most emotionally honest portrayals that I have seen on this subject matter -another being Nelson George's HBO film ""Life Support"" starring Queen Latifah.  Back to ""One Week,"" there wasn't a single moment where I felt what was on screen was anything but honest, and I applaud the filmmakers for that. I recommend this film to people of all ages and will end up purchasing this film to share with others.
The writing, the story arc, the character's journey was so clear and straight forward - not a single frame was wasted.  I really didn't expect to get as emotionally invested in this journey as I did, but I'm glad it happened. Great film.",1308873600,2,754,4.619402985074627
1807758,5,B00007ELD8,"The movie one week was co-written and starring Kenny Young and it is a powerful tale of how stereotypes existed (and still exist) within the world about who is most likely to contract an STD.  The movie's script is far from perfect, and the acting, as whole is not ALL Oscar-worthy, but as also as a whole, the way the plot is delivered along with the fact that the story-line and and the main character are sympathetic, make you realize this is a movie you may never forget.

This story begins with a man who is on the cusp of realizing his dream, he has been at his job years, has a fiance who loves him, and her family has welcomed him with open arms, so he now has the family he always dreamed of as kid as he moved from place to place.

Varon grew up in the foster-care system due to parents who were heroin-addicts, but when you meet him, this fact is not at first, evident or even known.  But, as the story unfolds, you learn that he has made a few mistakes, and is struggling to get his life toward that positive ending of a family, that he always dreamed of while watching the Cosby Show as a kid. Saadiqa Muhammad's strong acting as his fiance helps you see the pain that news like finding out that the man you love, and were less than 36 hours away from marrying potentially could be carrying an STD that can cause a much more deadly disease.  The story line progresses as Varon deals with the knowledge that the person who exposed him to HIV set out to deliberately expose him and all the men she came in contact with and even his best friend got exposed. The worst of it is that his best friend, who is also his roommate finds out he contracted HIV and, unable to deal with it all, ends his life with bullet to the head.  He ends up without a job, a best friend, and his fiancee, (who'd just discovered she was pregnant and had legitimate trust issues him due to some deceptions on his part earlier in their relationship), besides the fact that he may have unwittingly exposed her, the love of his life, mother of child, to HIV.

This is a lot to deal with for anyone, but how this former foster care child deals with, shows the man he has become and shows that we are a lot stronger than we seem.  Varon, who at the beginning of the movie had a life with so much hope and promise and was seeming to finally realize his dreams, now has to re-evaluate what matters to him most and where his life is going and what is he going to do with his future.

At the end, we see he and his wife have worked on things and he is attending university of chicago.  This is such a wonderful story.

We use this film to work with people learning to disclose their HIV+ status to family members, and sexual partners. People really relate to it.

1807782,5,B00007ELD8,This was a great movie. HIV/AIDS is no joke at all. Im glad they make movies like this to show people that it can happen to anyone. the end results was bad for both the friends and the fiancee (even though she didn't get it ) but its real; people do get HIV/AIDS. They usually show movies where the actor escapes the disease and the test come back HIV negative which is great but sometimes people need to see a movie where the person/actor does find out he/she has the deadly disease to make people aware.

The story was incredible. It really makes you go back and think about sex and how irresponsible we can all be. It shows why it is important to protect yourself and I think it should be shown to all the schools all over. People are always telling kids ""how"" important it is and not really show ""why"" like this did. This movie definately hit it dead on! I am truly impressed. Great quality work!
