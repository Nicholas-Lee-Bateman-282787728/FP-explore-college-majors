8537393,5,B0097BEE0A,BEST DVD!! for begging training!!,1521936000,,33,5.8
8537394,5,B0097BEE0A,"IMHO, this guy is near genius. Not even kidding, he uses the EVIL that is the flexi lead, constructively! No dog poop on your long line, no tangling it, no standing on it, and no complicated tying it up for later. His explanation of familiarizing your dog to a correction collar is spectacular. Previously, I had no clue how to use these tools, so I've steered clear so as not to ""ruin"" or ""shut down"" my dogs. This video really gives a good visual to advice from other trainers which gave me visions of falling into a gopher hole if I tried them at home by myself. I'm middle aged, a bit overweight and have a bad knee. Falling into a gopher hole is not my idea of a good time.

All in all, a great video for open minded people.",1514851200,,729,4.170212765957447

Michael Elvis is one of the greatest dog trainers that I've ever seen, and although the videos are priced rather outrageously, I guess I'll have to abandon other silly habits like eating, or maybe paying my taxes...but I need more Michael Ellis videos!!!!",1457395200,,278,5.2

8537400,5,B0097BEE0A,"Mr. Ellis is right. Nothing is more important to a dog and its owner than a reliable recall.  In this video, Mr. Ellis goes into great detail in explaining how to train it.  His approach is based upon a keen understanding and empathy for the dog's perspective combined with a thoughtful presentation for those attempting to train.  After training dogs for years, I'm quite surprised at just how much I can learn from Mr. Ellis and his approach.",1367020800,4,444,4.666666666666667
