968093,3,6305087393,"Let me make something clear: I Got the Hook-Up is a horrible movie.  It's low budget, not shot well, the writing is terrible, and the acting is downright awful.  But despite all that, I've probably watched this movie dozens of times.

For better or worse, Master P is the man personally responsible for making urban straight-to-video movies a cash machine.  Comedy, nudity, a hot soundtrack, and the legally-required role for Tiny ""Deebo"" Lister always makes for a decent rental on a slow day.

What really makes this movie watchable is comedian A.J. Johnson, who played the crackhead Ezal in Friday.  P obviously gave him complete creative freedom in improvising his dialogue, and he steals every scene that he's in.

I can easily see why most people would give this movie a one-star review, but for some reason I enjoy it, and it's part of my DVD collection.  Why I love this movie will always remain a mystery, like how women can't put on Mascara with their mouth closed.  If dumbed-down comedies are a guilty pleasure for you, check this movie out at least once.",1270166400,,1066,4.75

968095,4,6305087393,This was a nice funny movie. Fans of Master P and No Limit back in the late 90's will definitely enjoy it. Sure the acting may not be Oscar worthy but it's still a good movie.,1245542400,,175,3.888888888888889
968096,4,6305087393,Good movie for those of you that loved Master P and the No Limit Records Recording label in the late 90's,1242691200,,105,4.0476190476190474

968219,1,6305087393,"This is not a funny movie... Now I've seen thousands of comedies and is a big fan of africanamerican flicks and I Know what I'm bout...
This is nuthin like ""Friday"" or the next, ""Dont be a menace to South Central"", ""High School"" High or even ""Trippin"".
AJ Johnson is a really annoying guy, but he's simply a Chris Tucker,Chris Rock wannabe who's not funny at all.
And Master P has got to be the worst rapper to turn actor, yes people even Coolio has shown better acting skills.

968222,5,6305087393,"I'm the biggest Nolimit fan and this was a great film.
1st, it was funny
2nd, loads of actors; ice cube, P, C, DEEBO (from friday), snoop, and loads more.
3rd, this was the best acted film by NO LIMIT because it had better actors and it wasn't just another gangsta drug and violence film.
Even if u don't even like NO LIMIT this will defenetly surprise u.
The soundtrack is good as well, with appearences by; MASTER P, C-MURDER, SILKK, MIA X, MYSTIKAL, FIEND, SNOOP, MONTELL JORDAN, JAY Z, UGK, and many many more.

Why aren't there any negative stars! This doesn't even deserve the one!  I'm the first to support black movies but this one is shockingly poor! Master P, come on now!!! Who wrote the script?  Where was the script written?  Who was the casting director?  I have so many questions as this film was sooooooooo bad.  If I had to guess I'd say a blind monkey, whilst sitting on the toilet and the monkey's cousin was the casting director!!DAMN - It's a shame, there are so many talented writers who are never given a platform for their work but any one with money can put any trash out!  Even more surprising is the fact that ""I Got The Hook Up"" made a PROFIT!  What is wrong with you PEOPLE~ Trust Me, You deserve better!  (You might be thinking...what would she know, she is from London England) Let me tell you... Don't Be A Menace To South Central Whilst Drinking Your Juice In The Hood was the funniest comedy I ever saw!  Friday (NO NOT NEXT FRIDAY - BUT THE ORIGINAL)had me rolling  and Chris Rock was at his finest in ""Bring The Pain""!  This film lacks everything but most of all a STORYLINE!  The characters are one dimensional, the acting is dismal....God It Is Just Plain and Simple a WASTE OF TIME....SO MUCH SO THAT I DON'T EVEN WANT TO WASTE ANY MORE OF MY TIME REVIEWING IT",991094400,2,1304,4.3875
968224,1,6305087393,"This movie was sooooooooooo! daggone stupid its not ever worth writing a review, but I wanted to warn people that actually have good taste not to waste their time or money on this mess...DON'T DO IT...somebody said its mad funny, almost as funny as Friday....WHAT?...are you insane?, this movie should even be compared to a masterpiece comedy like Friday, on a scale of 1 to 10, obviously Friday gets a 10+++, and what does I Got the Hook Up get?.... its gets a negative trillion....get my point----good
I mean a comedy is a comedy, it suppose to make you laugh, which the movie did, but I was laughing b/c I couldn't believe Master P would put out some lame crap like this...""he did that""...
Master P, you got the dough, now you can at least make a decent movie, with decent characters that people can actually relate to and give Hollywood something to really talk about
This movie is trash and should be dumped immediately",977961600,2,924,4.606060606060606

968227,1,6305087393,This movie had to be the stupidest movie i have seen ..just another movie done by black film makers making black people look dumb..why not make a movie that is not steriotypical..and then you wonder why you are seen this  way..if you want to see movies portraying African Americans in a decent way  the way they want to be seen..watch Soul Food it's kinda corny but a good  movie with strong family values which is what most African Americans  believe in..I do not recommend this movie!!!,939686400,,488,4.6395348837209305
