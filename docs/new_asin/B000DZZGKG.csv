2476053,5,B000DZZGKG,"My hubby's been wanting this for a long time. He had it on videotape but the VCR's been gone for a long time now. This was his Valentine's Day present, and I thought we were going to have to stay home that night and watch it he was so excited! He's one of those that watches the games over and over and OVER again. He's watched it once so far and said the quality and picture were great and so much better than his old video tape. Of course, after he watches it about a million times I'll probably have to order another one.",1298246400,,524,4.048076923076923
2476054,5,B000DZZGKG,"I purchased this release of the '82 Orange Bowl because not only was I interested in seeing Clemson winning the Orange Bowl and becoming national champions, but also because I'm a fan of the way that college football and other sports used to be covered: simple, spare, and without all the annoying graphics and announcers that characterize today's broadcasts. NBC's presentation on 1/1/82 (two days before my 1st birthday) exemplifies why I feel the way I do, especially in that NBC then had the Proud N, which was (and still is, in my opinion) one of the most outstanding logos that a television network could ever have. Don Criqui and John Brodie also lent a lot to the broadcast, as did Bob Trumpy; the frequent visits to the coaches' boxes were very entertaining as well, because you could see and hear the strategy being figured out.

In short, this is a very good product for the money if you feel as I do that sports on television should go back to being as simply presented as this was on NBC, New Year's Day 1982.",1276300800,4,1022,4.554347826086956
8103083,5,B000DZZGKG,"The video is of the entire game. Not just the highlights. I'm not a Clemson fan but you don't need to be. This game was a classic. The video has a few slightly compromised seconds here and there but overall a great picture quality for it's age. And the midfield Orange Bowl logo is cool as any NFL fan of the last 35 years has seen many times before. I.E. Chargers/Dolphins, AFC championship, that game would be played the next day at the same location and the promo for it is the only commercial they left in. Nice touch.",1519603200,,522,4.282828282828283

8103085,5,B000DZZGKG,"Of course the video is not so great as this is 35 years ago, but what a great memory. I was a senior at Clemson and went to the game with my friends. I will never forget that night and how the last 6 seconds seemed to take forever!",1498694400,,231,3.7346938775510203

8103087,5,B000DZZGKG,"Awesome season. I was 17years old when this took place. I remember watching the game, but the actual plays I had forgotten the sequence of how it all played out in the end. This DVD/CD is a must have for all Clemson Football fans.

8103091,5,B000DZZGKG,"Outstanding quality dvd of the complete telecast including a short pregame and postgame but without any halftime. All is presented commercial free. There is a bit of a quality issue coming out of halftime as a line runs through the top third of the picture for approximately two minutes before clearing and all going back to wonderful. Should you find yourself not being as impressed by the quality as other reviewers have been, perhaps you should keep this tidbit in mind: JANUARY 1, 1982. That was the date of this telecast, making it thirty-five years old. A perspective that should help remedy any quality qualms you may feel.
A footnote to this game is that less than twenty-four hours later, on this same field, the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins would play what would become a historic and legendary playoff game. NBC was there to cover it, as well. As were Don Criqui and John Brodie. Quite an eventful twenty-four hours for those two gentlemen and the network.",1486080000,5,976,4.781065088757397
