6365402,5,B00JK32362,A great youth movie for the Beach Party crowd.  Transfer is crystal clear but appears small on your TV screen.,1403222400,,110,4.5
6365403,5,B00JK32362,This is a light-hearted movie about 3 girls and their relationships with men.  The movie is somewhat typical of some movies issued during the period - say from 1962 to 1966.  I have always enjoyed the sound track and watching Ann-Margret.  For some reason this type of movie appealed to me.,1403136000,6,290,4.647058823529412
6365404,1,B00JK32362,"The cheapskate morons at Fox strike again, releasing another film shot in Cinemascope in a  pan-and-scan version.  I woudln't pay five bucks for this insulting release, let alone the $18 to $20 they're charging here on Amazon for it.",1401148800,13,233,4.948717948717949
6365405,4,B00JK32362,"""The Pleasure Seekers"" is a film that some of us have been waiting a long time to see released in a North American (Reg. 1) DVD release, and instead of any preferentially treatment from the studio, 20th Century-Fox, it was dumped into its Cinema Archives MOD product assembly line, maybe because the reviews for the film had their detractors, but what is worse, it may not be a true widescreen presentation of the original Cinemascope film.  Inn any case,it is somewhat of an improvement than their original archaic decision to butcher the deliberate framing of certain directors for the Cinemascope lenses by presenting the films in pan and scan with a disclaimer before the film you used to see on earlier DVD manufacturing ""This film has been modified from its original format.""  In any case, ""The Pleasure Seekers"" is a very entertaining film directed by veteran Jean Negulesco, who also directed the original this film was remade from ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" (1954) and also the classic ""Johnny Belinda"" among many others.  Starring the very talented Ann-Margret, Carol Lynley (""Blue Denim"") and Pamela Tiffin (1962 remake of ""State Fair"" and the more recent Italian giallo ""The Fifth Cord"").  Also starring in the film are Tony Franciosa, Gardner McKay, Brian Keith and Gene Tierney (her final film and she has one big climatic scene where the old guard gets to tell the newcomers where the lines are drawn) and especially Andre Lawrence, who even sings a duet with Ann-Margret and seems to have more talent than being mere eye candy.  The film definitely deserved its AAN for scoring by Lionel Newman and Alexander Courage as it is a stellar job throughout utilizing the four songs by Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen.  My favorite is ""Next Time"" although all four songs are pretty good, and only one is usually on the Ann-Marget ""Best of"" collections called ""Something to Think About.""  Produced by David Weisbart in Color by Deluxe who later brought us ""Valley of the Dolls"" and many others.  20th will find people to pay their prices for the MOD product, but is it moral to treat them so shabbily by not giving them their money's worth?  The film is a baby boomers' dream come true, it's your prerogative how you want to spend your time.  Live.",1399766400,21,2259,4.813953488372093
6365406,5,B00JK32362,"I adore any film with Ann-Margret, and to finally have another of her 60's film released on DVD - Excellent!",1399593600,,108,4.45
6365407,1,B00JK32362,"People will regret buying this release. I got mine today & it's a ""DVD-R"" not professional release like you buy in store. Movie is not even anamorphic it's pillow boxed and looks like a stupid postage stamp on my 55"" TV. This is 2014 not 1997 no excuse for not releasing this movie like it deserves to be! Glad I have my great DVD from Europe because this is junk especially for $17.98. There's gonna be people that say the quality is great Ya because it's size of stamp. Fill the screen like it's suppose to be & see quality go bye bye. Oh well, better luck next time :(",1398124800,36,571,4.2

6365411,5,B00JK32362,"After 'How to Marry a Millionaire', 'Three Coins in the Fountain' and 'The Best of Everything,' trio-of-starlets specialist, Jean Negulesco directed this musical remake of 'Three Coins'. In dim hopes of updating the material to give it that now, 1964 feeling, its set in Madrid instead of Rome, and theres even less emphasis on the career girls careers.

At a news bureau, Carol Lynley spends her time pouring coffee and flirting; Pamela Tiffin simply wanders through art museums trying to look soulful; and Ann-Margret, were told, has gone native, even a little gypsy, sings, dances, a little modeling, a little bit of everything. Whatever their sources of incomes, this trio can afford a soundstage-sized apartment and have money to burn on shoes. (The films a foot fetishists fashion show as these career women parade around in stiletto heels and towels, stiletto heels and baby dolls, stiletto heels and sweatshirts, and stiletto heels and bikinis.)

These are not, however, the only heels in the movie. Lynleys torn between her married boss Brian Keith and bachelor reporter Gardner McKay; in the Prado, Tiffins picked up by playboy Anthony Franciosa; outside, Ann-Margrets run down by motorcycle-riding doctor Andre Lawrence.

Bits of the first films story keep turning up  heres the office cocktail party  but there are countless What could they have been thinking of? additions, like Ann-Margret entertaining the guests in a skintight flamenco dress, throwing around her red mane like shes suffering a seizure, and lip-synching the fall-down-funny title song.

Troubles brew when the gals fall in love: Keith takes Lynley to a party, but instead of the privacy they seek, they run smack into the biggest peril that working gals come across in the workplace, the bosss wife. Breathing fire as Keiths missus, Gene Tierney corners Lynley in the ladies room, and snarls her way into the annals of high camp. Whats the goal, sweetie, a nasty little love nest? Thats all you get  if that, Tierney steams. No cold-eyed, calculating little vipers going to do me out of a thing. He doesnt give a damn about you, you little tramp!

Realizing the error of her ways (She called me a little tramp!), Lynley decides to return to the United States, and when they're wronged by their fellas, so do Tiffin and A-M. The films unintentionally hooty highlight comes when A-M tells Tiffin  while each is wearing five pounds of eye makeup  that Its over. He cant afford me. Tiffin sniffles sympathetically but says, Dont  my mascara will run. A-M tries to fight back her tears, too. What am I doing? she says aloud, Im not wearing any mascara.",1440892800,3,2629,4.97945205479452

6365413,5,B00JK32362,"I was so delighted to see that this movie has finally made it to DVD.  I LOVE 60s movies, especially those that are shot on location in Europe.  This is a ""remake"" of 1954's Three Coins in a Fountain, about three American girls in Rome.  This one takes place in Madrid.  It's a bit corny and sexist for our time, but still VERY ENJOYABLE to watch!",1433376000,7,347,4.212121212121212

8651635,1,B00JK32362,This movie is made on demand. The TCM site states that this movie is made in the FULL SCREEN aspect.  Don't know why any studio would record their movies on DVD or Blu-ray in a TV or pan & scan format when they were made in Panarama or cinemascope.  I'll pass on this one until in comes out in the original theatrical format.,1496966400,2,325,4.142857142857143
