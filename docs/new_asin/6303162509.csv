8157747,3,6303162509,"The four ten-minute shorts here vary from fairly charming (CLOWN PRINCES and ALFALFA'S AUNT) to mediocre (ALFALFA'S DOUBLE) to impressively awful (TIME OUT FOR LESSONS). The MGM Our Gang shorts aren't as good as those from the Hal Roach studio, but some of them are quite endearing. None of these are among them, as far as I'm concerned - THE BEST OF SPANKY and THE BEST OF BUCKWHEAT are both better collections - so I'd recommend this tape mainly to those of the series' devotees who feel they have to see everything.",969840000,5,518,4.641304347826087
