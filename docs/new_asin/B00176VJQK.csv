A groups of riders come singing into town. Next we see a man in a buggy fleeing while being fired upon. The pursuers plant evidence to prove the man was a thief. Roy Rogers rides to the mine to investigate. The mine manager explains their policy against thieves. A letter to Roy says a writer will arrive to get information for a book. There is a surprise here! The boys sing a song boasting of their courage. [How many bullets in a six-shooter? Sixteen? The script plays with the western legends.] This horse opera mixes in singing and music with dramatic events. There is a secret to the San Angelo mine. It is being used to bring silver from a low-cost area to a high-price area; they are arbitrageurs and smugglers.

The padre asks for help to find a missing sentry. They search all night and find nothing. There is no time to get a search warrant for the Monarch mine. Roy and the Sheriff fall into a trap. Later a stranger shows up to search for a man. There is a new owner to this land, like a feudal lord. Who can it be? There is more humor in holding a fox hunt. [This pads out the film and provides a chase scene.] Two men abduct Bates and hit him. Who would want to hurt him? Roy surmises that smuggling is going on. They find a hidden cave from an old legend. Lee Madison is sent back to summon help, but she is stopped. Trigger the Wonder Horse gets through and summons help! Reinforcements arrive to turn the tide of battle. Gridley takes Lee as a hostage. Two dogs run after them. Life imitates art. The bad guys are captured after a fight; the dogs helped. There is a happy ending.

These films provided entertainment for millions of children in the 1940s. Sixty years later you can see them as low-budget entertainment. They are never shown on TV since the 1950s. It also shows how a powerful corporation can oppress the people. If you were born after the 1950s you can view what used to be popular entertainment. This is an amusing film if you don't expect too much from it.",1426723200,,2024,4.349206349206349
