8477103,3,B005KQ8O1Q,"Erich Leinsdorf, Music Director of the Boston Symphony from 1962-69, leads a cool, dispassionate account of the Mahler First that's most notable for the precision of the playing and the glorious sound of the BSO. At the time they were probably the greatest orchestra in the world, and this remarkable performance helps confirm that assessment. The lushness of the strings, the refinement of the winds, and the athleticism of the brass are still a wonder to behold. Leinsdorf manages to keep them together without a baton (or a score for that matter). His gestures range from the tiniest motion of a finger to flailing his arms about wildly. Only once did I see him crack a smile. His interpretation of this great symphony is similarly joyless. Those seeking the irony, biting satire, and wanton ecstasy of Bernstein will be sorely disappointed (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphonies-Nos-1-2-3-Leonard-Bernstein-Sheila-Armstrong-Janet-Baker-Christa-Ludwig-Wiener-Philharmoniker-London-Symphony-Orchestra/dp/B000AC5BEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler - Symphonies Nos. 1, 2 & 3 ~ Leonard Bernstein, Sheila Armstrong, Janet Baker, Christa Ludwig, Wiener Philharmoniker, London Symphony Orchestra</a>). Leinsdorf's tempos are quicker than average, but nothing ever sounds rushed.

The Strauss is more of the same: cool, objective, and surprisingly humorless, especially given the comic nature of Till Eulenspiegel's story. Gone are the fantasy and wonder that Serge Koussevitzky (BSO Music Director, 1924-49) found in his celebrated 1945 RCA recording&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-Juan-Op-20-Sprach-Zarathustra-Op-30/dp/B000007N8X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don Juan Op 20 / Sprach Zarathustra Op 30</a>. Moreover, Leinsdorf lacked his predecessor's (Charles Munch) grace on the podium. His stiff, mechanical gestures seem better suited to a contemporary New York City traffic cop. Again the BSO plays splendidly, especially concertmaster Joseph Silverstein and flutist Doriot Anthony Dwyer.

One of my fondest musical memories was a New York Philharmonic broadcast from the mid-1970s with Leinsdorf leading a joyous, yet often heart-rending Mahler Fifth. This encore performance of the Adagietto alone is simply gorgeous. Leinsdorf doesn't lean into the suspensions the way Bernstein did, but his reading is wonderfully serene and graceful. The BSO strings shine more brightly than ever here, and their seamless phrasing transforms the music into a tender love song. I'll return to this magical encore quite often; it's a perfect source of solace in an otherwise harried and frightful world. Alas, the applause at the end comes much too soon and completely destroys the mood that Leinsdorf labored so painstakingly to establish.

The video (from 1962 and 1963) is sub-par even by the standards of the time, with its all too frequent wide shots of the wind section, odd camera angles, and annoying reflections off the double bass, brass and wind instruments. Several times the camera pans across a number of idle musicians in search of the soloist. The sound is unexpectedly good, though hardly comparable to LPs of the era. The bass register sounds surprisingly rich given that most TV sets of the time could not possibly have reproduced the sound with such clarity. The treble, on the other hand, is harsh, and the wind and brass solos in Till Eulenspiegel all sound off-mike.",1329004800,2,3476,5.961923847695391
8477104,5,B005KQ8O1Q,"For now I will have to say that this has got to be the most stunning and the most perfect performance of Mahler's 1st I have ever seen or witnessed, despite the likes of Bruno Walter, Jascha Horenstein, Leonard Bernstein, and Rafael Kubelik. As you may know Leinsdorf recorded the Mahler 1st for RCA Victor during his first season as music director of the BSO. The resulting RCA recording is still very much held in excellent esteem (see its' amazon reviews, currently available as part of a 2 CD set containing Leinsdorf's BSO Mahler 3rd.) As tremendously good and impressive as that RCA recording is, this one (recorded live at Harvard's Sanders Theatre, approximately a month and a half after RCA placed their microphones in Boston's Symphony Hall) is even better. Tempos are just perfectly balanced from first bar to last, and Leinsdorf's control and precision over the BSO (without baton) is just a sheer marvel to witness. Though black and white via early reel to reel video tape, sound quality if played on a good stereo system is also far superior to the RCA, WGBH-FM  broadcast quality. The performances of the Adagietto from Mahler Symphony 5 and the R. Strauss ""Till Eulenspigel"" which conclude this DVD are equally the marvel. As a footnote, if anyone remembers the staggering live Leinsdorf Tchaikovsky 5th from his final '68-'69 season, I am also thrilled to report that ICA Classics will be releasing this to (in color) in the spring.
