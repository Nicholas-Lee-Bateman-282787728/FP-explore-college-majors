3804374,2,B001UTXAW0,"Good acting/ good story for the most part/ too much swearing/i didn't care for the transexual part, which remained hidden for most of the film./ Too bad, because without these 2 very big negatives, I would have given it 5 stars. A waste of my time",1469750400,,247,4.391304347826087

3804377,5,B001UTXAW0,"This was a well acted movie, especially by the young actress, playing the title character. See this movie is exactly why I like to collect these type of movies. I love family movies, particularly when it's a good story.
This brings back a lot of my childhood I missed. So i'll continue to find movies like this. My goal is to reach 1000 movies total in my collection.
Thanks to Amazon for having it available .",1409702400,,410,4.407894736842105
3804378,2,B001UTXAW0,"As there is little useful information here about Jan Dunn's low budget melodrama, ""Ruby Blue"", I will throw out a few observations. The title is a reference to the racing pigeon that much of the story revolves around. Note that the title line in the promotional material incorporates a silhouette of the bird.

The promotional material would lead you to believe that this is a children's film with Bob Hoskins (Jack) and Jessica Stewart (Florrie) having a lot of ""Bad Bascomb"" (1946) moments in the tradition of Wallace Beery and Margaret O'Brien. They do have some scenes together, the most effective and least contrived segments of the film, but the cute-kid-as-a-redeemer is more side story than central focus. Despite the misleading marketing material there is little here that would appeal to children. Dunn's script is filled out with a host of tedious characters and subplots that detail the life of a depressed widower (Hopkins). Imagine Michelangelo Antonioni expanding the short film ""Wasp"" (2003) into a 112-minute feature length non-judgmental examination of working-class suburban living.

According to the back of its DVD case, ""Ruby Blue"" (2001) is ""an uplifting journey"" and ""a warmly human story about life and love"". As portrayed here that journey is mostly dull and boring. Hoskins' performance makes it all tolerable as this makes the story seem deeper than it really is; unfortunately this just causes viewers to focus on the missed opportunity as the naturalistic script gives Hoskins so little to work with.

The ending (if you can manage to hang on till then) is a little too tidy, you can't help thinking back on scenes that if cut would have left room for a more convincing resolution. But this was probably quite deliberate as Dunn may want to show that a neighborhood has the capacity to come together to help someone, then instantly turn on him when their paranoia kicks in, and then just as quickly back off and become nice again.

No doubt the film would do a much better job of connecting with viewers if the poor audio did not obliterate much of the dialogue. A closed captioning feature on the DVD would have been an obvious solution but they skimped and did not include it. The French scenes are subtitled and therefore easier to follow.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1282089600,,2319,4.89058524173028
3804379,5,B001UTXAW0,"Bob Hoskins is fantastic as Jack, a man who lost the will to live and can't figure out a way to carry on until he reaches out to the children of his community who need him. In keeping a neighborhood boy from trouble by allowing him to look after his pigeons and by babysitting a neighborhood girl, Jack restores his live to live and even finds love in the least likeliest of places. The film underscore what it means to be human - to be prosecuted at the same time as to do your own prosecuting, to have your own prejudices and to be prejudiced against, but most importantly, it teaches us that living our lives in the way we want, for our sake, is the best way to go about things.",1247875200,2,681,4.166666666666667

8345026,5,B001UTXAW0,"A wonderful film with a strong social message. We can't judge people without finding the truth first. There were two surprises in this film. I'll let you discover them for yourself. At the end of the day, people are people. We need to look beyond those things we can't change and have no choice in being. Age, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. are all meaningless. The sooner we learn this as a society the better.",1473120000,,419,4.6

8345030,5,B001UTXAW0,"This story interested me from start to finish. You see a man who's grieving for his recently dead wife, and how he slowly comes to trust in others and start living again. There are some major twists and turns that will completely surprise you. And the story of how the child went missing is a total shock. I highly recommend this movie. It's well-acted and completely believable. Excellent film!",1470873600,,395,4.739130434782608
