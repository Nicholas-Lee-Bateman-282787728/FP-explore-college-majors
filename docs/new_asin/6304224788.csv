7865008,5,6304224788,"The first time I saw this movie was back in late 90's, maybe 1998 or around that time, and I loved it. The female actresses are really beautiful in the movie.....mostly Kim Catrall, she's so young, nice, and sexy looking in this movie that I really enjoyed it. But the point is, is that the movie itself was a really great story about mental health. Definitely would watch it again. I love these kinds of movies with great beautiful female actresses. Of course, avoid looking at the nudity parts as always, just because people aren't around.....does not mean The Creator is not watching......",1403827200,,592,4.757281553398058
7865009,1,6304224788,"John Savage heads a cast of direct-to-video regulars in a muddled psychological thriller. The ""Deer Hunter"" co-star plays Dr. Ian Lazarre, a deeply troubled psychiatrist who tumbles into a deep blue funk of drinking and despair after his first wife dies in an auto mishap. His second wife (Candice Daly) and his best friend (Eric Pierpoint) have him committed to a rehab clinic operated by the mysterious Dr. Vernon Renquist (Malcolm McDowell) and the equally ambiguous Nurse Chambers (Kim Cattrall). And that, of course, is when Lazarre's troubles really begin. The poor guy must cope with ever-increasing doses of an experimental drug, nightmarish visions of an executed serial killer, and sporadic beatings by a bulky orderly (Sam Jones) who enjoys his work much more than he should. ""Where The Truth Lies"" is long on spooky atmosphere, but short on narrative logic.",986860800,4,869,5.170212765957447
