John will also tell you that the Big Bang Theory is a thing of the past...and it's baloney! I believe he's right on that...Which begs the question - Why does the Universe have to have a beginning? So it's more like us? I know that this theory is mainstream and the professionals who go along with it have to in order to keep their jobs...deep down I'd love to know what each of them really think.",1355270400,3,526,4.479166666666667
8447494,5,B004XW8N3M,"""Come see the moon,"" John Dobson entreats passers-by on the streets of San Francisco as he encourages them to peer into his telescope in the opening frames of ""A Sidewalk Astronomer."" ""Come see the moon!"" With similarly passionate enthusiasm, this digital-video documentary, directed by Jeffrey Fox Jacobs, invites viewers to pause for a moment and consider their place in the solar system, the galaxy and the universe.

Mr. Dobson is the inventor of the Dobsonian telescope mount, which revolutionized astronomy by making powerful and inexpensive telescopes available to amateur stargazers. At 89, he spends his days traveling from college lecture halls to astronomy clubs to a convention of telescope makers in Vermont, spreading his gospel of curiosity about the stars.

Mr. Dobson defines himself as a cosmologist rather than an astronomer, noting that he is interested not only in the stars but also in ""the whole ball of wax."" He is also a kind of spiritual teacher, having spent more than two decades as a monk in a Vedanta monastery of the Ramakrishna order in San Francisco before leaving to start the Sidewalk Astronomers, a worldwide group of hobbyists who build their own telescopes and congregate for ""star parties.""

Mr. Dobson has a gift for explaining scientific concepts in the form of wry one-liners. Noting that our bodies contain the dust of exploded stars, he points to a photograph of a nebula, saying, ""If you give this cloud another 10 billion years, it will go to school and chew gum.""

As Mr. Dobson philosophizes in voice-over, we see stunningly beautiful images of the planets, stars and galaxies he describes. ""A Sidewalk Astronomer"" is an inspiring film about an inspired teacher. It should leave all viewers with an ounce of curiosity eager to hit the streets with Dobsonian telescopes of their own.
