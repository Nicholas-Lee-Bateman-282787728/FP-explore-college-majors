8428145,5,B004FPE45S,"Considered docking it one star for not being the complete show...but enjoyed it too much to do that!  Great pure concert footage of a pretty good show - I am in agreement that it is much more watchable than Macca's commercially released DVDs, which always smack a bit of pretension in their ""behind the scenes"" additions.  Video/audio both excellent, if not perfect for the more anal amongst us...  Highly recommended to any Paul fan.",1384387200,2,434,4.837837837837838
8428146,4,B004FPE45S,"This review is largely comparing this DVD to several of the other commercially-released McCartney concert DVD's I have seen.  In that sense -- it probably deserves 5 stars.  In a vacuum...3 stars.

This one still has the same problem as all the others:  the camera angles CHANGE TOO FREQUENTLY.  In that sense, it's frustrating to watch and doesn't recreate the experience of how I think most of us watch concerts -- or want to see concerts.

Having said that, there is slightly LESS of this cutting in this release than others I've seen.  Thankfully it's NOT quite as frenetic and maddening as, say, Back In U.S., Red Square, etc, which I find practically unwatchable.

So, I like this one better -- if only for that one reason.  And at least the vast majority of shots are of the BAND MEMBERS as opposed to the AUDIENCE.  (Very thankfully there is no non-continuous backstage tour footage etc.  This is solely a CONCERT shown in real time -- with the cameras mostly on the musicians -- which is precisely what I want in a concert DVD.)

It's also not as SLICK and SWEETENED-IN-POST as other McCartney releases -- which is to say you can actually hear/see an occasional flub or drifting of pitch.  For me that is not a negative -- in fact, I prefer it, because you really get more of the feeling that you are watching/listening to a REAL LIVE PERFORMANCE rather than fake studio overdubs.  However, in lacking slickness, it also lacks state of the art video quality.  Which is to say-- the resolution is not particularly HD, but it is professionally shot and certainly watchable.  But not uber crisp on my Blu-Ray player.

The setlist has many Beatles songs including a couple not readily available on other concerts such as Good Day Sunshine, I'll Follow The Sun, Michelle and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window.

There are no extra features a very limited menu options.  While the concert is in Quebec, the disc itself is an import from a Spanish (or Portugese?) speaking country.  Which is to say that the text on the box and any text on the screen (occasional and unobtrusive subtitles) are not in English.

Basically, if you're looking for a relatively straightforward concert video, without bells and whistles, and you can endure a relatively frantic pace of cutting (although not as bad as several others of his DVDs) and this setlist appeals to you, I think you'd be happy with this.  I definitely am.  Of course, the performance itself is great -- as it is on all McCartney concerts.  The man (and his band) never fail to put on an amazing show.  And what a catalog!",1377129600,3,2581,4.657079646017699
8428147,4,B004FPE45S,"1/08/2015 Note, When I bought this DVD in did not cost 36.00. Now having all McCartney's US releases I wanted to see how this one was from a Canada show. There were a few songs on this one that weren't on any others. From Ram, Too Many People. An early Beatles song I'll Follow The Sun.  This show wasn't  as flashy as the US shows, With Paul talking before and after every song. His singing was pretty good for a man in His sixty's in 2008. His band played really well covering his music from the past. Wix Wickens is the key board player that make all the sounds we  here in the old Beatles songs. Got to get you into my life, Penny lane, the string sounds on Eleanor Rigby. He has been in McCartney's bands for over twenty years. The whole band does a great job with the songs.  To some it up, it felt like a live show, not a fixed live show to make every thing perfect. If your a McCartney person you will like this show.",1367712000,3,925,4.093922651933702
