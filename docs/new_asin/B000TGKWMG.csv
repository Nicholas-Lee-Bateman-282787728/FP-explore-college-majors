8209052,1,B000TGKWMG,The product is a third rate product that did not even contain all the season 1 programs but was a mix of season 1 and season 2. Very un-professional in its quality.  Several emails with the vendor to return the product and all they did was send me a message that an email would follow with the information I needed to return the product.  Never got the email.  I would never purchase anything from this company.  Nothing but a rip off.,1337558400,13,435,4.333333333333333
8209053,5,B000TGKWMG,"The criticisms I've read here are all BOGUS!!! Maybe they miss ""todays"" production hype!!! I DON'T!!! I prefer the old-way of production!!!

The Complete Season One (IN SEQUENCE) of the Beverly Hillbillies is OUTSTANDING! Sound! Picture! Memorabilia! ,,, all Original and of the HIGHEST Quailty!!!

This is the BEST vintage / classic television production I have ever purchased. ,,, and I do own some lousy post-production ""copies"" that suck to high heaven. One being The Vintage Theatre, Beverly Hillbillies. The updated sound sucks (also has an obnoxious updated laff-track) the picture (grainy) the music (NOT original) and the episodes are edited from their originals. They even send you duplicate episodes in their B.H. package :-(

I prefer the ORIGINAL laff-track, it is much more subdued and NOT every 2-seconds as todays productions are done, Yuch!
 (And yes, I hate laff-tracks.)

With this purchase at Amazon ,,, even though I've seen most B.H.  episodes recently ,,, it is very refreshing and very entertaining to watch the ORIGINALS over&over again!  The Amazon B.H. Season One package includes the ORIGINAL old-fashioned method of NON-OBTRUSIVE advertising i.e. Kelloggs. NO over-the-top, in-your-face obnoxious advertising! Only gentle commercial reminders (memorabilia) something todays MARKETEERS care NOTHING about :-( today it is all in-your-face and obnoxious!

You will love this purchase ,,, I guarantee!",1322870400,,1426,5.569444444444445
8209054,5,B000TGKWMG,"If you remember anything at all about the Beverly Hillbillies you absolutely have to get the first season !  Do you remember how they worked their sponsors for the show into the theme song at the beginning ? I of course am not in favor of cigarettes but hearing the Winston song again was quite funny to me. Do you remember Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs singing "" Pearl Pearl Pearl "" ? These shows are hilarious.  What ever happened to decent, funny, well written shows like these ?  Don't expect any dirty or nasty language and filthy story lines here - just lots of fun to watch !!!",1311552000,19,584,4.339449541284404
8209055,3,B000TGKWMG,"You're better off buying Set 1 and 2 of the ""Ultimate"" Collection, and the Holiday Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction disc if you want all season 1 in a non-dvr format. They are licensed from the Henning estate (my guess as to why the hold up on official season 1-legal issues) And are complete with extras. I found all three here through Amazon and their vendors for less than the price of the dvr version. Yes...you will get a bit of overlap with the official season 2...but....my two cents, that's your best option right now....so I give the DVR version 3 stars...for having all of season 1....but they can do better...and the above-in my opinion-IS better....",1268006400,50,659,4.84070796460177
8209056,4,B000TGKWMG,The Beverly Hillbillies is the Beverly Hillbillies.  Buyer beware!  What I do not like is the issuing of DVD's in the DVD-R format.  DVD-R's will not last as long and are not as durable or reliable.  The cost is usually high.  Where is the official 1st season?  I am definitely going to back away from videos if the DVD-R format is going to be used.,1264550400,35,349,4.292307692307692
8209057,5,B000TGKWMG,Great!  I was beginning to think the complete first season had been intentionally overlooked since it was never available for purchase at any major retailer.,1264550400,,157,5.28
