8072846,5,B000A2WCI6,"I remember talking to Victor Reuther about his favorite ""movie"" (yes, that was the word we used) about the origin of the UAW.  His preference was a film done by the BBC for the 40th anniversary of the event and his least favorite was the wonderful ""Babies and Banners"" which has been ritually condemned by every one of the old UAW leaders (because of its use of a Ford plant scene while discussing Chevrolet and the not-quite-accurate view of the Women's Emergency Brigade's contribution).  This film uses extensive interviews with Victor, the Krauses (long-time editor of Solidarity), and others.  The American Experience crew found a great deal of original footage that even the UAW archives did not own including material from the Kelsey Hayes strike.  While I never had the privilege of hearing Victor talk about this film, I am sure it was his favorite as it was an accurate and rousing depiction of one of the signal events in his life.  I recommend it completely.",1257897600,5,970,4.819277108433735
