It's true that the Baekje protagonists are all digging their own graves, and one can't help feeling that they deserve their fate.  Of course, having watched Sill-centred epics such as The Great King's Dream (GKD) and, in particular, Great Queen Seondeok (GQS), one would be somewhat biased against Baekje whose last two kings only had themselves to blame.

Interesting to compare the respective depictions of Kim Yu-Shin here and in GKD and GQS, and the Kim Yu-Shin/ Gye Baek confrontation (their last battle) here and in GKD. Ultimately, he is the only character in this epic whom one can engage with (perhaps because he is more restrained than anyone else). As to Gye Baek himself, he must be one of the most naive ""heroes"" ever. consistently mishandling all his relationships. All he knows is fighting.

As to the ending (last two episodes), that's simply ludicrous (miraculous redemption of Eun Go). But then, the mental processes of all the main Baekje protagonists are depicted  in the most implausible manner.",1469664000,,1250,4.9052132701421804

The stories are very cool and true to life, the culture and customs are a wonder to watch and did I mention the Beautiful clothes they wore?  Of course you learn about the uppers classes that had the nice things and you also learn about the lower classes and even slaves which were regular people either born into slavery or kidnaped and force into the life of a slave (which breaks your heart).

I could go on here, but I am suppose to give my views on whether its a good buy or not....  YES especially Gye Baek, as a child he and his Dad are wonderful then as the story progresses, as an adult Gye Baek is very the best!!!  He's has good strong morels and values, After I watched this series I did some research and found out more about the history of Gye Baek.  Good series and has a lot of true fact based events in it too.  I recommend this set!!!",1370217600,2,939,4.126373626373627
