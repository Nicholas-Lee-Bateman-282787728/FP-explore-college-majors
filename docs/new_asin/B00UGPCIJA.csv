Laura Partridge owns 10 whole shares of stock shows up at her fist stockholder meeting. The corrupt board, Fred Clark, John Williams, and Ray Collins and the ONLY honest one there....CEO (PAUL DOUGLAS). She asks so many questions and annoys everyone. She is drawn to Douglas who is leaving the company an appointed government job. If you cannot beat them join them....The corrupt board ""hire"" Laura to keep her 'busy'. She is put in charge of creating good will among the little stockholders. When Douglas fails to send any contacts to his old company, The Board Members send Laura to Washington to ""entice"" Douglas. This is fun. From over bearing grumpy bachelor Douglas who is drawn to Laura. As a final stockholder meeting gives way to Laura and her Proxy votes. Judy Holiday is excellent as the ""blonde"" who not only is beautiful but can is very funny. Douglas is great as the grumpy CEO who Laura breach his defenses. And John Williams who heads the corrupt board with his ""starlet"" in skimpy outfits to ""promote"" more than the company.",1494201600,,1156,4.809045226130653
