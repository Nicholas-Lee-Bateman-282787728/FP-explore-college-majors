1900598,5,B0000A14WH,"As a high-school teacher for history and English foundations, I must utilize movies as a visual aide supplement to help them connect with the characters, setting, dialogue... I strongly recommend using this dvd to support your curriculum to teach on all levels of student learning (auditory, kinesthetic, visual).",1230076800,,313,5.541666666666667

Some sites don't offer it or charge ridiculous fees (Walmart) to ship to APOs. I am very pleased with this purchase!",1198972800,2,285,4.2

1900602,5,B0000A14WH,"I bought this DVD in 2003 and decided to view it again the other night, finding it just as entrancing now as then.

The 2-disc set is divided into two parts, with the first disc being largely based on Jay Winik's spectacular bestselling book, APRIL, 1865; the program includes several notable writers and educators, such as William Davis, James Robertson, and Brian Pohanka among others of the Civil War on hand to give comments. Further, this first disc is broken down into April 1865: The Month That Saved America, and Civil War Combat: The Tragedy At Cold Harbor.

The second disc comes from A&E network prior to the History Channel going on the air; the disc has a biography of Abraham Lincoln, and General Robert E. Lee, with a Civil War Journal biography of Jefferson Davis. A final added feature is a copy on two screens of the Gettysburg Address.

My wife and I bought this at one of the Virginia battlefield sites in 2003 prior to returning home after visiting the old and new Cold Harbor battlefields near Richmond, and Appomattox Court House.  We both enjoyed viewing these discs again and again; enjoying all of Virginia so much, that we moved from Ohio in 2006, and are now living in Virginia!

If you are interested in the 1864-1865 Lee-Grant Overland Campaigns in Virginia, or the end of the war from Richmond to Amelia Court House to Sayler's Creek and finally Appomattox Court House, these discs will bring you untold enjoyment.

1900603,5,B0000A14WH,"""The Last Days of the Civil War"" gives the viewer a fascinating look at the end of the American Civil War, our greatest test as a nation! The Five Impressive Documentaries include:

-""A&E Biography: Abraham Lincoln."" A closeup look at the man who led America through it's darkest hour.
-2 ""Civil War Journal"" Documentaries that look at the lives of CSA President Jefferson Davis and CSA General Robert E. Lee.
This set gives an accurate look at the end of America's greatest conflict! Historians and non-historians alike will not be disappointed! Grade: A+",1074556800,46,940,4.808641975308642
1900604,4,B0000A14WH,"This exceptional History Channel documentary looks at the last month of the Civil War. Lincoln is ready to sue for peace; Booth awaits his chance to eliminate the enemy of his country; Despite the fall of Richmond, Davis is determined to fight on; Sherman continues to burn his way through the heart of the Confederacy; Lee rallies his army time and again to continue the fight; Grant fearing a guerrilla war offers to parley with a reluctant Lee.  So much was in the balance in the last month of the Civil War that this documentary spends 6 entertaining and interesting hours investigating what happened, why it happened, and the men who made it happen!",1068595200,25,654,4.7368421052631575
1900605,4,B0000A14WH,"Before purchasing this DVD set, I had hoped that I was purchasing material I never saw before.  I was sort of disappointed to see that the History Channel had put together a compilation of previously aired shows featuring rather old material.  There are three biographies that cover Lincoln, Lee and Davis.  The Lee and Davis episodes are entirely taken from the Civil War Journal series.  On disc #2, a look at the Cold Harbor Battle is brought in but that came from the Civil War Combat Series.  Again, these are not new productions and can be found or represented in other series availabe from the History Channel.  Most welcome was the copy of the documentary called April 1865 that recently aired earlier this year (2003).  April 1865 takes a look at the end of the Confederacy and how the nation dealt with the ending of the war and the loss of President Lincoln.
Had I known that this DVD set contained old material I already have, I probably would have settled to buy only the copy of April 1865.  Together, all of the programs are very informative and contain a lot of great insight although I would have prefered new material. Quality wise, this is a great set, though I give it a 4 because a lot of the material is older and not new.",1065139200,80,1244,4.497777777777777

1900607,1,B0000A14WH,"Not as described. Disc 2 was exclusively about Lincoln; even worse exclusively revisionist history. Nothing about his war crimes. I bought it because disc 2 was advertised to include information on Cold Harbor in1864, which was NOT included. The last great victory of the Army of Northern Virginia and an example of Grant's lack of concern for his own casualties.",1428537600,,363,5.066666666666666

1900610,5,B0000A14WH,"I purchased this for middle school viewing. That being said, they were, for the most part, engrossed in the presentation.",1399852800,,121,5.1
1900611,5,B0000A14WH,"Just a month or two ago, we came across the History Channel offering of ""April 1865, The Month That Saved America"" on TV.  It was superb.  I went to the History Channel to buy the DVD, only to find it was now out of stock and no longer offered.  I am so happy that I persisted and found this set on Amazon which has that disc as part of it.
  What was driven home by it was the not only the dignity and integrity of Robert E. Lee and Jos. Johnston, both of whom refused the order from Jefferson Davis to conduct guerilla warfare, but also the magnanimity of Lincoln and Grant and Sherman in the surrender terms that started the nation back to healing.  A very poignant scene was of Lee going up to take communion at the rail next to a Black man who had the audacity to go up for communion at the traditionally white railing, and that act had paralyzed the congregation and minister.  Healing the nation was a very close run thing.  I just had the privilege of corresponding with  Al Stone, the re-enactor who portrayed Lee; a warm and friendly, and knowledgeable man.",1396569600,,1067,4.321608040201005
1900612,3,B0000A14WH,"I expected more, perhaps in depth facts from the history channel. So this was disappointing for me. For someone in Jr. high with a report due, this maybe more interesting then a dry text.",1389225600,,187,4.529411764705882
1900613,4,B0000A14WH,Pivotal time in the story of our nation. Explains well how bravely the South fought till the end despite incredible hardships. Also you get to see how Grant was a different kind of general who relentlessly pursued Lee despite great losses. One of the worst defeats Grant endured was a battle at Cold Harbor which is explained in detail in this documentary. Grant said it was the worst decision he made in his entire life was the North's futile attack on the South at Cold Harbor. A must for Civil War biffs,1388620800,2,506,4.510869565217392
