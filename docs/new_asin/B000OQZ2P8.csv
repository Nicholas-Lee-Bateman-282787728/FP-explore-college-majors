Sadly, ""Subspecies II"" doesn't quite live up to the standards of its colorful B-movie predecessor. Oh, it's still got plenty of gooey blood, skeletons and  Radu being hilariously awesome, but the main characters seem to have been badly wussified. And the introduction of Radu's ""mummy"" (who even looks like one) just doesn't add anything to the movie.

When the ""subspecies"" creatures reattach Radu's head, he returns to life and immediately kills Stefan. Michelle (Denise Duff) barely manages to escape his castle with the Bloodstone (which has somehow morphed into a white stone in a claw) and runs away to the nearest city. She pleads with her sister Becky  to come get her, then immediately ends up on a wild trip through the city's nightside.

Meanwhile, Radu has decided that he sorta kinda likes Michelle, so he asks his ""mummy"" to help him take back the Bloodstone and make Michelle his plaything. Yes, the evil vampire is asking his mommy to help him. Meanwhile, Becky (Melanie Shatner, daughter of William) arrives in Romania and tries to figure out what is going on with her sister, and discovers the horrifying truth of what Michelle is enmeshed in.

Even though it takes place only minutes after the last movie, ""Subspecies II"" doesn't work quite as well. The major reason is that both Michelle and Radu are drastically wussified - Michelle spends most of the story whining, crying and throwing up, and Radu starts running to his desiccated mother for help.

Additionally, a good one-third of the story is just Michelle running around the city, crying, whining and donning increasingly gothic clothing. However, the other two-thirds are actually quite solid, especially since it alternates between the day and night sides of the city. It hasn't quite got the flavor of the original, but the inclusion of club-gothic and Victorian gothic is a nice touch.

And the climax is pretty deliciously ""Subspecies"" -- we have gooey blood, repeated stabbings, and someone being set on fire. So basically, it's lots of fun.

Shatner gives a fairly decent performance as a strong, businesslike young woman who is having to grapple with the news that vampires not only exist, but that her sister is one. Kevin Spirtas is more of an annoyance than an actual character, and Michael Denish makes a decent Van Helsing for most of the movie. And... well, I'm not sure if Pamela Gordon actually plays ""Mummy,"" or if she just voiced a blind dried-up mummy that someone dragged out of an Incan grave.

It's not quite as good as the first one, but ""Subspecies II"" is a decent sequel with a nice new lead character and some delicious atmosphere. So now, on to ""Subspecies III.""",1328313600,,2823,4.874739039665971
8186434,5,B000OQZ2P8,"The continuing of the Greatest Vampire Series ever (my Opinion).  Radu is in search of the Bloodstone stolen from him by Michelle (played by Denise Duff). Denise Duff who in my opinion brings a new freshness and emotion to the character of Michelle that was lacking by Laura Tate. She plays the part perfectly of a women who was is stuggling to keep from losing her humanity as her vampire side struggles to come out.

Add her sister who comes to help and find her as well as solve the mystery of her Michelle's  strange behavior. With help from a Skeptical  Man from the American Embassy and a Bucharest Police Detective who speaks broken english  he learns from watching American TV.

This movie was good and picked up were the first one left off.  I've allways enjoyed the Full Moon videos and this one  you will love and enjoy if your a fan of vampire movies.  I recommend seeing it.",1249689600,,887,4.49375
