7588899,1,B01A69PD0G,"Just finished watching ""Eisenstein In Guanajuato"" released by Strand Releasing.
Written and directed by Peter Greenway, ""Eisenstein In Guanajuato"" is perhaps described as a clever conceit wrapped within the pretense of a Soviet propaganda disguised as a biography. It's also a rather bizarre attempt at a highly stylistic art film.
 ""Eisenstein In Guanajuato"" explores the final fall from American Hollywood grace of the once prominent and revered Soviet film maker Sergei Eisenstein.  He is supposed to be filming his next great movie about Mexico's great revolution - which is being financed by the great American Novelist and Socialist Upton Sinclair.
Only Eisenstein has bought into the hype and is filled with his own self-grandeur and strays far off course.  Palomino Canedo, his guide and a professor of history at a Mexican university, is all too happy to give Eisenstein what he wants, as long as the money holds out.
If you like artistic biographies that highly romanticized a highly flawed and self-aggrandizing individual, this movie is for you.
Not a great movie.

7588901,2,B01A69PD0G,"I love Peter Greenaway and I love Sergei Eisenstein. I had real high hopes for this film; it seemed like a true return-to-form, as I haven't been a big fan of Greenaway's later works (Nightwatching/Rembrandt's J'Accuse). But I was shocked by how badly made, over-written, and hollow this movie was. It's like he rushed the script out in a week and didn't figure out what he wanted to say until he got into the editing room, which is probably why it begins and ends with Greenaway himself explaining the meaning of the movie.

The real disappointment is in the potential of the subject matter. Eisenstein's failure to complete Que Viva Mexico combined with his whirlwind romance and his experiencing a brand new culture sounded like a fascinating and deeply moving story. Unfortunately, Greenaway didn't make that film. He made a film in which Eisenstein, one of the most brilliant and gifted minds in cinematic history, is reduced to an irritating man-child who never does any work and never says anything remotely interesting; he simply regurgitates Greenaway's own tiresome catchphrases about cinema while running around in geometric patterns for no reason (It isn't that far off from the worst of late-period Woody Allen.) Poor Elmer Bck does his best with a depiction of Eisenstein that doesn't make any psychological sense. In Nightwatching, Rembrandt was vulgar but he was clearly a good and well-intentioned artist (And we actually got to see him work!) In this film, Eisenstein is a pompous layabout who belongs in a straight jacket. There is no romance between Eisenstein and his guide (Luis Alberti, by far the best thing in the film) -- nothing as moving as the love story in The Cook the Thief, for instance. Instead, we watch a cold and tedious sex scene that tells us nothing about either character or their feelings for each other. Maybe if we could have seen how losing his virginity influenced his CREATIVE work, then it's possible that the film could've worked. But after this sex scene, nothing happens. Eisenstein spends the rest of the film like a five-year-old who's had too much sugar before bedtime until the movie ends.

Nightwatching, for all its issues, is a masterpiece on par with The Cook the Thief compared to Eisenstein in Guanajuato. For a man who constantly goes on about the need for cinema to be reinvented, Peter Greenaway needs to get his mind out of 1990s CD-ROM technology and spend a little more time on his scripts before he goes into production. I cannot believe he made a film this empty and lifeless about one of his alleged heroes. Then again, I suspect this film isn't actually about Sergei Eisenstein at all. I invite readers to fill in the blanks themselves...",1472774400,5,2709,4.874186550976138
7588902,5,B01A69PD0G,"I enjoy period pieces if done correctly, clothing, locations, actors, cinematographers, and the writing. I enjoyed it very much. The film catalogues a series of events taking place in an accurate historical city, and manages to weave international historical context to bring about an exceptional view of a persona that I have never heard about. The city stills in the film are brilliant, the staging is of course theatrical, nothing Hollywood about it. The images, if viewed with an open mind take you back in time. It feels like a documentary at first much so like the film ""The Circle"" however, as the minutes pass it creates substance.",1472169600,4,639,4.925925925925926

8746595,4,B01A69PD0G,"As one who admired and enjoyed Greenaways earlier films, I honestly haven't watched much of what hes done since The Pillow Book, but coming across the trailer for Eisenstein in Guanajuato I was very excited and could barely wait to watch it.

I was originally going to wait and purchase this film when it came out on Blu-ray, but since it never has been released on Blu, when I came across the film on Netflix I couldn't wait any longer to see it.

For me, the film was very rewarding yet disappointing to various degrees.

Cinematically, technically, and visually the film is fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it from start to finish. The sets, settings and production were excellent; visually it was easy to tell this was a modern Greenaway film. As with his other works, the look and style of this film plays just as much a part as the characters themselves (though I missed a little bit of the languid pacing and drawn-out shots present in his earlier films).

As one who appreciates a good biopic, I found the subject fascinating. While I was aware of the movies of Eisenstein mentioned in this film, I had not seen any of them, nor did I know much about Eisenstein as a filmmaker. The acting of both the eccentric lead and supporting roles were all very well done.

Where the film fell a touch short for me was with how little we got to see Eisenstein as a director. We got a wonderful account of his personal traits, but I had hoped there would have been a little more included as far as his actual filming in Mexico. I liked what was in the film so its not a matter of cutting what already was thereI would have been fine making it longer to include parts with Eisenstein working on the film (though I realize his struggling to complete the project by being distracted by other interests is part of what this film is about).

I also went into this film thinking I would sympathize with and like the main character more than I did. As an artist I am always fascinated by books and films that dive into the personal lives and frames of mind of artists, but in this case I found Eisenstein to come off as annoyinghe reminded me of Michael Gambons Theif character ranting and raving about in Greenaways The Cook, The Thief. However, whereas I loved watching the Thief character, I found myself getting fatigued with Eisenstein by the end of the film. I didn't find the character any less interesting, but I expected to have a more sympathetic view of him from an artist standpoint. This is more of an observation rather than any kind of negative critique of the film.

My minor complaints aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and look forward to additional viewings. I think my expectations were just a little different, and some of what Ive mentioned is just personal preference. While the film obviously focused on Eisenstein, I wish it would have expanded a little more as I felt the areas of him it did focus on was a little narrow. What was included in the film was perfectly fine, I just would have liked a more well-rounded exploration of the character.

Essentially I feel we already have an excellent film that could have been even better given a little more length to expand its range of ideas and to experience more of the main character.",1506556800,,3263,4.537414965986395
