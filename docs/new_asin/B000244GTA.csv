8021820,5,B000244GTA,"Again I like Robert's acting and he had me very convinced he was a horrible person.  It really doesn't if he plays a evil person or an ordinary
person, I think he is an excellent actor and a very intelligent man.  I love to look  at the interviews and listen to his answers to the questions
that are usually not an ordinary response.  He is over and above in every way, any other actor I've ever seen and so multi-talented. Cindy Babin",1455580800,,435,4.2682926829268295

8021822,1,B000244GTA,"Arrived loose in the case, scuffed and skipped during playback.  Begs the question: How much trouble is to shake a sealed dvd before sending to see if it's loose???  Too much bother to return for refund.  Sorely disappointed.",1412553600,,225,4.868421052631579
8021823,4,B000244GTA,"1980's ""Dark Forces"" (AKA: ""Harlequin"") is an Australian Sci-Fi Fantasy thriller that has a lot of great things going for it.  The screenplay by Everett de Roche is top-flight and most probably the reason it won two international sci-fi/fantasy film festivals awards.  It is a modern day re-working of the story of Rasputin and shows together with great direction by Simon Wincer (director of many later films like ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,"" TV's ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""The Phantom"" (1996) with Billy Zane) what using your imagination can do.  Like many other international films, there are several editions one can choose to get ""Dark Forces"" in this country, this Elite Entertainment edition with a number of extras including a trailer gallery, isolated music score (by Brian May) and commentary track with Simon Wincer and producer Anthony I. Ginnane, which would be especially interesting since production has some flaws that translate into any problems the film has in being credible.  Associate Producer Jane Scott and Executive Producer William Fayman along with Production Designer Bernard Hides, special effects by Conrad C. Rothman and Director of Photography Gary Hanson allow for a lot of cheesy elements.  For example Broderick Crawford is too much his old self at times when playing the villain, the man in power who is the negative thing about big government.  Editor Adrian Carr and Brian May's music are very good.  Wincer did not get enough of a good performance either from David Hemmings, but Robert Powell (who played Jesus in Franco Zefferelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"") gives another riveting performance.  Carmen Duncan delivers a bravura performance as well, sometimes shown just a little over, again faulting the production and director's choices.  Mark Spain plays the little boy quite well.  The other major edition of this film is a Special Edition from Synapse Films, who have done some rather outstanding Blu-rays of select Hammer Films recently, so I imagine they did the film justice.  It had been the more expensive edition.  Elite Entertainment's edition is very reasonable, making the film even more accessible as, despite its own failings in the production, still do little to damper its credibility as its sense of imagination runs high, it deserves a wider audience.  Elite presents the film in 16 x 9 Anamorphic Widescreen, Color.  This is definitely an over-looked gem, one that again deserves a wide audience and has a lot to say about the powers behind the scenes even in doses of incredibility gone credible.",1377043200,,2559,5.164648910411622
8021824,4,B000244GTA,"Known in the rest of the world as HARLEQUIN, this modern mystical ""Svengali"" story with a twist has never had a decent home video release. Shot in expressive widescreen Panavision it doesn't translate well to indifferent pan & scan jobs, like the OOP VHS and U.K. cheapie DVD. Elite has issued a very nice looking 16X9 enhanced scope version with Director and Producer commentary, a nice and informative touch.

 David Hemmings, a political hotshot, has a terminally ill son who seems to magically improve under the (seemingly) benign influence of a modern ""court jester"", (Robert Powell) who appears at his son's birthday party as a clown and ends up insinuating his way into a position of influence with his wife and child. If this sounds very Rasputin-like it is, but the story has a few surprises along the way.

 If you've never seen this gem and like subtle and tense supernatural / suspense stories give it a try.",1090627200,11,920,4.80379746835443
