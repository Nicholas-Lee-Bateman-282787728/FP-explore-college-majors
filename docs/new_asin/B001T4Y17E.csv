8340538,1,B001T4Y17E,"It was terrible, the worst movie I have seen, I gave it away.",1462752000,,61,3.769230769230769
8340539,1,B001T4Y17E,"I read the reviews, rented it at $2.99 because reasons. Couldn't find a release date on this and didn't bother Googling it. Should have...but curiosity, dude! Started off BAD. Said, ""Okay, day off, I'll give it the duration of a latte."" I gave it the playing time of a scratch ticket. Hey, can't win if you don't play! (I don't recommend playing this one...)",1440115200,,358,4.609375
8340540,1,B001T4Y17E,"If you love the X-Files, then skip this one. It has nothing at all to do with the X-Files. It is sort of like a name dropper that is meant to impress. The problem is this film cannot deliver a thing. To be perfectly honest it sucks! If you want to buy it anyway then that is your fault. You have been warned!",1375574400,3,308,3.9047619047619047
8340541,5,B001T4Y17E,"Don't be fooled by CIA planted negative reviews, this is a must see for UFO collectors seeking hidden knowledge! This was the best film I have seen created by the efforts of dedicated MUFON members seeking to reveal a secret government program to breed a new race of humans who will rule the world after the coming man-made Apocalypse. This movie is based on the LAPD X-Files reported by thousands of women subjected to Alien abductions in the Southern California area. Banned by 13 countries for being to controversial for the public to view!",1301097600,3,543,4.787234042553192
8340542,1,B001T4Y17E,"This is an absolute 3nd rate movie and even the dialogue was so childish it was hardly bearable to watch.
This movie has made a mock of the real life experiences of Abductees and UFO sightings and the quality of the movie is hopeless and do I not recommend this DVD to anybody, it was poorly made.....don't waste your money on it , its rubbish.",1244332800,,344,4.3076923076923075
8340543,5,B001T4Y17E,"We are priveleged to present a film that reveals years of secret files about the scope and number of alien species influencing world events. The coming climate change is just one of the events that will herald the coming of a new age for all mankind as genetic sciences alter our DNA and prepare us for Alien/Human intercourse.

A dramatic presentation of Earth/Alien secrets revealed.",1237939200,,385,4.923076923076923
