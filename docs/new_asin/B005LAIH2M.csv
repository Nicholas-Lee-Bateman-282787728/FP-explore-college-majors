4745557,4,B005LAIH2M,"Once again critics have just under estimated this film. Yes i know this film is not great but its pretty darn good. I admit walking into the theater i had low expectations about this film i really did sadly. I mean it did not look great from the trailers but i went in and came out happy that i skipped The Last Stand to see this. There were problems with the film i have to say but not many. I don't get how critics came down wand said this film is one star worthy and horrible crap. This film looks like Van Helsing and Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter wait that sounds interesting hum the title is way similar to Hansel and Gretel : Witch Hunters. The problem is i hated Abraham Lincoln so now you see why i came in thinking this film was going to be bad. Yup. This is the first 2013 i have seen this year, and thank god the first film i saw was good. OK now onto the few bad stuff i had with this film. The few things were well the cheap look of the film, language, character development , the open scene, and the length. Ok so this film had a look i didn't like this film just looked cheap like a cheesy B movie which it was not but it just looked like it sadly which kinda took away the class and that with the film. Maybe if they spent more time with detail stuff would look less cheap and better like the candy house and the troll. The language in this film was unnecessary. I mean characters (mostly Hansel) says the F - Word as a joke i mean whats with that how can that be funny. He is all like F this and F that and F F F . It was not needed to make this film good it just was not. It made the film seem stupid like that it was just not needed. This films characters were under developed i mean we needed much more scenes with Edward the troll he was not in enough of the film so we don't learn a lot about him and the same goes for Hansel's love interest Mina plus the teen boy Ben. There was just not a lot of those three and sadly one of them we will never see again in upcoming sequels which i expect will happen due to a decent box office gross. If they don't make sequels we will never know what each of their stories are. But this film was made to set the stage for the oncoming films in the series which it did well enough. The opening scene which had the young Hansel and Gretel coming to the ginger bread house and burning the witch. Well the thing with this was it was just not right. I mean why would the kids just walk on into a strangers house, this part i think should have been at least 7 or 8 minutes longer to better set the stage for the older Hansel and Gretel. The opening was poorly written with little lines spoken and the witch could barely speak English it was just a poor opening. Onto the last thing i did not like which was the length of the film. This film was just too short for this story. this film is an hour and a half which is not enough. Maybe adding an extra half an hour would have been way better so they could extend the opening, add more scenes with Edward the troll, more scenes with Mina and Hansel together, and finally more scenes with Gretel and Ben together (not as a couple but you know what i mean) and well more scenes with Gretel period, sadly she was over shadowed by Hansel due to such a popular actor they had. So naturally she was left out in the rewrites. Ok now on to the good things which include the acting, cast, visuals, action, entertainment, plot, characters, and gore (R- rating) . Ok lets begin with the acting. This film was well acted including new talented actors which are Gemma Arterton , Famke Janssen , and Thomas Mann. Everyone acted excellent in this film you can tell everyone was having a great time doing this film. Which caused the acting to be really good, which surprised me actually. Everyone acted as if it were real and it made me feel like wow is this actually happening. The cast was really good. Everyone looked like their characters mostly the young Hansel and Gretel which really did look like the older versions of the characters. Which really got me thinking wow these people look just like the people in the book. Wow. That was very interesting. The visual effects are not award winning by no means but for only a budget of 50 million i think they did quite well with what they had actually. Which was very good. Like the troll looked cool and that and the flying bullet was cool and well detailed. The action is very good and well paced out we have story then action story then action then more action and story it is just interestingly fun and entering my next subject entertaining. This film is just a dumb fun entertaining film that will keep you at the edge of your seats screaming in excitement as Hansel and Gretel fight witches and that its just so much fun which is rare in a January film actually. The plot i hear has not received good reviews which i don't get whats so wrong with it, yes its simple but its all the same good , am i right even when i took my dad to see this he said the script was weak. Why? Its pretty good to me. The characters are good they are very interesting and they make you want to know more about them. They are characters that if they died you would cry, i am not lying these are good characters. The gore in this film is good, i know i usually go for less gore and a PG- 13 rating but i actually believe that the R Rating for this film made the film better then expected it really did i say so anyway. All an All critics under estimated this films potential. While this film is not a award winner it is still a really really good film. So check ti out in theater if you want to be entertained on a cold January day. B+ This review is by James A Pasierbowicz",1359590400,15,5700,4.117594254937163
4745558,3,B005LAIH2M,"Hollywood seems to be on a fairy tale kick these days and when one studio is on a kick, the others have to follow suit to compete. Last year we had competing Snow White movies and the first movie to follow suit this year is ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"", an R-rated take on the classic fairy tale. As a reminder, Hansel and Gretel are the two twins who stumble across a house made of candy in the forest and commence to eating before they realize that they are enjoying the spells of an evil witch. That is pretty much how this movie starts out as well, but after that, the fairytale is elaborated upon to say the least.

Hansel and Gretel are legendary witch hunters when the movie picks up in the middle of a small town about to burn a supposed-witch at the stake. The town has had a rash of child abductions and in classic witch movie fashion, they are out for blind justice on whatever witch they can get their hands on. Jeremy Renner (Hansel) and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) play the title roles and they bring a strong level of coolness to a movie that is already loaded with coolness.

The movie starts off fast and never slows down. The action is fast and furious and the 3D is exceptional. The action scenes are quick and entertaining, although much of the moments are lost with edits that are too quick. Things come hurtling toward your face and to say the least, the 3D works well. Just because a movie is loaded with non-stop coolness and special effects doesn't mean that it is without flaw though.

""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is 95 minutes of entertainment and excitement. The villain, Muriel, played by Famke Janssen, is exciting and dangerous. You fear her after the first time she single-handedly annihilates a group of witch hunters. Unfortunately though, that is the only real emotion I ever felt in the movie. The movie never slowed down to establish a connection with its title characters and the audience. When their lives are in jeopardy or their friend's lives are in jeopardy, it never once pulled my emotional string. They justify that emotion as well, by not caring either.

""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a fun trip to the movies, but when it's over, it's over. You won't care about it anymore. It won't live on in conversation with any of your friends. It garners only a shrug of the shoulders and a quick, ""Ehh."" It's too bad too because it is also one of those movies that had the potential to be great. The director obviously knew what he was doing visually, but was too wrapped up in looking cool that he forgot to make people care.",1359417600,9,2581,4.5203426124197
4745559,3,B005LAIH2M,"To say that this movie was bad is an understatement. The dialogue was horrible. The story was full of more holes than Swiss cheese. What's really big? Hmm... let's say a planet. But not a small planet like Pluto that gets downgraded from being a planet; let's say something around the size of Uranus, yeah, that one works for this. The plot holes were so big, Uranus could orbit right through them. The movie was absurd. Ludicrous, even. Actually, the movie was at Ludicrous Speed.

And I loved it for that. Okay, well, maybe I didn't love it, but I love it in concept. I enjoyed most of the heck out of it despite how bad it was.

I can imagine how the concept for this movie came about:

#1: Let's make a vampire movie!
#2: Vampires are too done, right now. People are over vampires.
#1: Well, let's make it vampire hunters, then!
#2: No, that's still vampires.
#3: What about witches? No one is doing witches.
#2: Ooh! We could do Hansel & Gretel! They fight a witch.
#1: Witches are lame. They're old hags that can't fight. You'd just have witch hunters walking in and killing all the witches.
#3: We can give them powers.
#1: Like vampires! They can be super strong and super fast.
#2: And know karate!

And, so, we get these huge fight scenes of pasty faced witches that look like vampires and act like vampires, except for the biting, where everyone smashes through trees and boulders and flings spells and never get hurt. It was kind of awesome. I mean, it was completely unashamed of itself in how bad it was. It was like watching a four-year-old rolling around in a mud puddle being all self-satisfied. In fact, it was exactly like that.

I mean, it was like watching kids play an imagination game where they keep making stuff up as they go.

It starts out in a pretty normal Hansel & Gretel setting with some peasant abandoning his children in the woods. The look of the movie is as if it's set in the 1600's. All hovels and burning at the stake and all of that. But, then, as they become witch hunters, there's a scene of newspaper clippings of all the witches they kill as hunters. Newspapers which, of course, didn't exist. All of the ""photos"" are sketches. The movie is full of anachronistic things of that nature. The movie just doesn't care if it fits the time period or not, which is part of what made it fun. It's also part of what makes it ludicrous.

Kid #1: We're being attacked by a witch!
Kid #2: I pull out my crossbow and shoot at her!
Kid #1: She's too fast for your lame crossbow.
Kid #2: It's a double-barrel machine crossbow!
Kid #1: Fine! I pull out my gun!
Kid #2: You can't have a gun! They didn't have guns!
Kid #1: They didn't have machine crossbows either.
<silence>
Kid #2: You can have a gun.
Kid #1: It's big shotgun, and I shoot at the witch!

The whole movie is like that, and, really, it does just wallow in it, and it made it a lot of fun.

Unlike, say, Van Helsing (with Hugh Jackman) which is much  the same but took itself much too seriously to be enjoyable. In fact, Van Helsing is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, which is unfortunate, because I thought Jackman did a more then fine job with what he was given. Hansel & Gretel never takes itself seriously, and, so, I never had a problem with it. Despite all of the horrible inconsistencies. Even as I sit here writing this, I'm thinking about some of the stupid things in the movie, like the witches being, basically, a separate race and the fact that they don't actually look human at all, so why is there ever a witch problem to begin with? But I kind of also don't care even though my brain is yelling at me that I should care.

Seriously, it's up there yelling, ""That's so stupid!"" And I'm shrugging and responding, ""But it was fun.""

Which is not to say that I'd actually recommend the movie to anyone, because I wouldn't. Unless you like mindless action, because that's what this is. Mindless action with a vague setting. Total cotton candy. If you like that kind of thing, this movie is just for you.

As for the rating, it gets 3 stars because it would get a 2 on ""goodness"" but a 4 on ""enjoyableness.""",1359331200,6,4116,4.3507170795306385
4745560,5,B005LAIH2M,"The film ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" centers around the close knit duo of Hansel (played effortlessly by Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (played in an incredible way by Gemma Arterton).  Both Hansel and Gretel are pretty much forced into a life of being witch hunters after they dare to eat from a secluded candy house in the forest.  I enjoyed the fact that Hansel and Gretel were created as characters of a brother and sister who stand by each other through good and challenging times. Hansel and Gretel's character evolutions are indirectly shaped (in different ways) by a discreet white witch named Mina (played in a heartfelt way by Pihla Viitala) and a troll named Edward (played naturally by Derek Mears).  In all fairness, Famke Janssen also played her witch character in a convincing fashion and in a way that also helped strengthen the tight bond that Hansel and Gretel have.  ""Hansel and Gretel"" is fine for those who are ok with watching films that mash fantasy and dark comedy in the plots.",1359331200,32,1004,4.786127167630058
4745561,5,B005LAIH2M,"My grandfather and I saw this film Saturday night. I knew I would enjoyed it but I really loved it! I loved the story line that after Hansel and Gretel encountered their first witch as children they make it their holy mission to be witch hunters.  And there was a twist with Hansel and Gretels mom. I also thought they picked great actors for the movie and Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton were of course the ones that shined. I was surprised critics hated this movie but don't go by what they said, if you like magical twists on fairytales go see it. I will warn you that this is not a movie for children. The witches were very frightening and they made me jump. And there's a lot of cursing and violence so it's not for the little ones. I hope you enjoy it like I did. This film I felt kicked Snow White and the Huntsmans butt by far.",1359331200,129,836,4.192546583850931
4745562,4,B005LAIH2M,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is like a bloody and F-Bomb filled version of Van Helsing. In this case, that is a good thing. Van Helsing was pretty bad, but they pushed this one far enough with the R rating to please the horror fan inside me. The witches look nice and creepy and most of the CGI is well done. Jeremy Renner (Hansel) is a fantastic actor, though he is mostly wasted here and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) is more of the focus based on her looks and her character's personality. Famke Janssen has fun with the lead evil witch role. This film barely runs 90 minutes and it is light on story and high on action, but I had a good time watching it. Worth a future rental if you don't mind turning your brain off and just enjoy the fact that it is not as bad as you feared it would be.

Oh, the IMAX 3-D was better done than most non-blockbuster type action films.

Edit (7/6/13): I had to knock it up a star after watching the Unrated Cut. Still a very fun movie upon second viewing.",1359158400,131,989,4.2
4745563,4,B005LAIH2M,"In the original Grimm's fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel are abandoned by their parents, captured by a witch, and escape being eaten by pushing the witch into her own oven.  So what happened to them afterward?  Wonder no more. It turns out that brother and sister grew up to be witch-hunters in medieval Germany.  ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is an interesting genre bender, part horror, humor and fantasy.

The prologue retells the fairy tale.  As the story gets underway, Hansel and Gretel are in the City Augsberg, which is under siege by witches who are kidnapping children.  Brother and sister (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) are hired to hunt down the witches.  What they find is a bit more complicated, a large coven led by a grand witch (Framke Janssen) who are preparing for a special ceremony, for which Gretel is the missing ingredient.  She will need rescuing by Hansel, assisted by a local fanboy and a plucky white witch, in a dramatic finale that brings the siblings face to face with their own origins.

The movie gets off to a bit of a slow start; its mixed elements make for a choppy delivery.  Renner and Arterton take a while to work up some chemistry as siblings.  Fortunately, the movie is full of surprises, including their medieval-tech weapons, and doesn't take itself entirely seriously.  The ending works well; recommended.",1359158400,,1354,4.839130434782609
4745564,3,B005LAIH2M,"This movie was good and has very original story to it. Of course, I'm talking about the after story and not about the whole story that we already know about. I have never heard of the idea of Hansel & Gretel grown up and they are traveling around the world fighting witches. I must say the idea is great start, but is the movie great? I say, NO!

The movie had many characters and I believe the casting people did their job right and made a great cast for this movie. I love the casting choice of Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, and I believe they were Hansel and Gretel. So, I had no problem with the casts in my opinion.

I like the costumes and CGI. No problem with that. I didn't watch the movie in 3D, but I did see many scenes that looked to be just made for the 3D effects. All the 2D visual effects I did like and the bloody gore in the movie did look great. It was not over done or underdone in anyway and that's great to see that.

As I said for the story line it self was great idea and it works. The movie did its job by showing Hansel & Gretel finding and destroying witches for the whole movie. The movie did its job in telling a main plot for the story. And, the story also tells us a new reason why Hansel & Gretel were abandon in the woods and uses it to fit into the reason why Hansel & Gretel were geared towards being witch hunters.

So, what I don't like about this movie. I didn't like a lot of things, but I start off with what I noticed first. I don't like the fight scenes in the movie. The fights are often too fast and not choreography well. What I saw was many scenes throw together and many switching of the camera. The fast camera to camera, back and fore of fighters are way too many times. Throw a punch. Switch! Another person throws a punch. Switch! Another person throws a kick. Switch! Somebody ducks. Switch! And so on. Sometimes, I would see them standing and they would just do a Switch to switch! What??? Why can't they just do more than one thing in a shot? Like punch, kick, jump and throw and now switch or at least two things. Like a simple punch to the guy and other guy punch back? Oh wow. Must be way too hard and complicated! Do they really need to turn many cameras around so that the viewers will get dizzy? Seriously, once you watch that first big fight scene you will see it.

I don't like the directing of the movie. Often the movie will feel choppy and a lot of things are just thrown in and it goes to scene to scene, but there are no TRANSITIONS to get to those scenes.  Often, I would be slightly confused and throws me off a bit.

The setting for the movie is correct and cool. It looks like early middle ages/dark ages, so characters using crossbows makes sense, but them using guns don't make sense at all. The idea of crossbows and guns just don't mix well. They have guns like old western movies. But, they are dressed up like dark ages look. But some weapons are even more advanced than they should be. I don't believe they should still be riding those horses then. Shouldn't they have vehicles? Why are they living in these cottages? Shouldn't they be living in brick buildings? Why is only their weapons so advanced, but everything else stayed in middle ages/dark ages? That made me wonder and it just doesn't make sense.

If they have some high tech gadgets, why not give them some better form of communication too. Really? When Hansel & Gretel got lost from each other, why did they have to yell out to each other? This doesn't make sense? They got all the crazy toys and stuff, but the writers felt they didn't need to give them a good form of communication? Like some signal flares? Actually wait... who needs signal flares? I say just give them walkie-talkies. This movie seemed like they would do whatever it wants at anytime, so give them walkie-talkies. Have them call each other and say, ""yeah, I'm at our old house in the woods."" ""I'll be there in a hour or so."" Now that would had more sense then what we saw in the movie. Gretel is lost. Hansel trying to find her and he is kind lost as well. They both are searching in the woods...but there no real showing of this. That's what I believe they are doing because there not really a TRANSITION to this. Then, bang...we see it and they both are there in the house like they planed to be there at a convenient time. But, guess what? They didn't communicate with each other and so it just happened to be like that. I say NO WAY! Give them walkies!

This movie could have been so much better. They would had to just take out certain things that I talked about and do replace with certain things as well. I still recommend this movie because it has an original story and the characters and CGI were great.",1359158400,3,4727,4.24916573971079

4745886,4,B005LAIH2M,"This is a highly underrated film that flew beneath the radar during its initial release, but has gained some momentum on home video. While the plot is pretty much nonsensical, the writing, acting, special effects, music score, etc. are all first rate, with much credit due to Jeremy Renner in the lead role.

The story starts out loosely following the original fairly tale, but that entire premise pretty much goes out the window after the first scene. What we are left with is a highly original story that is told much in the same fashion as Van Helsing and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. While those movies definitely diverged from historical facts, this one completely befuddles any resemblance to the timeline of human history by introducing inventions such at the Gatling Gun and the electric dynamo to the middle ages. Forget about suspending disbelief. You should pretty much expect anything to happen.

While the plot may be nonsensical, it is just realistic enough to set the background for some great one-liners, special effects and stunt work that must have taken a miracle to pull off without someone actually getting hurt. This is basically a comedy disguised as a horror film and it works. It is a bit heavy on gore at times and has a bit more sex and bad language in it than I would want my children watching, but for adults it is a rollercoaster of fun that never takes itself too seriously or lets historical facts stand in the way of a good story.

If you liked Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Van Helsing, Pride, Prejudice and Zombies or even the Blade series, you will most likely enjoy this. If you didn't then I would skip this movie entirely, because you obviously have no sense of humor.",1511740800,,1714,4.74496644295302

4745933,1,B005LAIH2M,"This is not a very good movie. I am not a horror movie fan but a huge fantasy movie fan, and I guess you could call this fantasy horror. There are some gross scenes, but not many. The story was actually very good but they didn't put it to good use and the movie plods in some places and just speeds along for no reason in others. Being a big Jeremy Renner fan, I was hoping this would have been better. The chemistry between Renner and his love interest was non existent, while the chemistry between him and the actress who played his sister was much better. The one completely gratuitous love scene was really bad and blissfully short. The actress who played Gretel, who was also the princess in the Prince of Persia, was the one good thing about this movie. I would like to see her in more American movies, as she is a very good actress. I think Renner just wanted some extra cash to renovate another house which is why he said yes to this movie. Could have been a much better movie, I think, it the director was a lot better and the story was realized in a much different way.",1502064000,,1079,4.242718446601942

For info to help you decide to watch or not, and/or let the kids watch: There is some nudity (one scene), adult situations, some intensity,violence and gore (not excessively gratuitous throughout, note the word throughout). Not for my kid when he was young, and not for those that are uncomfortable with the aforementioned qualities. the premise is clever, but not fully realized by the writing (my opinion). But for me good enough to enjoy periodically. If Famke was more prominent (especially without the makeup - which is great but not flattering) I'd watch it even more often.

The quality of the Blu-ray is excellent - showcasing all the good qualities of sound and picture the movie has to offer. This one has some pretty good demo material for showing off your home theatre.",1501113600,,935,4.993589743589744

$ 9 99-$ 13 99 Buy -  that's what I did to watch the unrated movie version, which was awesome by the way! If you like this movie, i would highly recommend the movie called Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft witch (get it? Ha ha!) is also available for purchase on Amazon.
Plot: JONAH AND ELLA MAZER (Hansel and Gretel) were happy, normal teenagerssent to an elite boarding school. The Head Master, SEBASTIAN, seems to know more about the brother and sister than they know about themselves. As both get to know their high school classmates, strange and frightening things begin to happen. When their new friends explain that they are all descended from powerful witches, and theyve been waiting for Hansel and Gretel to join them and complete a new generation of the Coven, both refuse to believe them. But its not until Hansel discovers a message from his mother in an old leather-bound book of spells hidden in the school library, that he understands their true and dangerous destiny  slaying witches.",1483747200,,1462,4.7976190476190474

4746798,5,B005LAIH2M,"Stylistically compelling with visually stunning costume, props, scenery, sets, and players, this film is a joy to behold. Bored of witches? You won't be. Fast zombies transformed the genre.. forever. Likewise, these witches change the way witch stories are told. The rhythm spacing the films action sequences and character development is right.  The space between action scenes gracefully exposes character development for characters I actually cared about. Uncharacteristically sophisticated dialog is punctuated by expertly timed and delivered, memorable one-liners. Sadly, post production did not nail the timeline for the final battle. Mina was unashamedly idle for what seemed like many minutes of story time and was surprisingly unthreatened, unhindered, unfatigued, and unscathed for a machine gunner. Ben might have been able to hit Muriel as she escaped the final battle, if she had unwittingly both announced her passage and crossed directly into his field of fire. I might have had her dealing with a nasty, severed and exposed knee injury  just to slow her down enough to make the story fit Ben knocking her out of flight. As a benefit, the Boss battle could be much more gruesome, and tragic. The change from overconfidence to loss of hope and impending death fought off with only last ditch anger at having lost is a very tragic and unnerving thing to behold. It was over too quickly. Would Hansel and Gretel have experienced gut wrenching, conflicted empathy for something loathsome but still human? What possible childhood trials could have contributed to so cold and numb a pathos for witches? Why are they compelled to end the voice that could reveal meaning or insight to their own murky, tortured past? I will watch it again. I will recommend this film to others, but not for kids. I will advocate playing this film to monitors around the house during Halloween parties as a conversation kicker.",1477612800,2,1915,5.154340836012862

4747558,2,B005LAIH2M,"While I really enjoy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is far too flawed for me to enjoy it much. The actors are pretty good at giving campy performances and the plotline itself is pretty interesting, but the writers and director have come up with a film that simply doesn't work. It becomes nothing but an extended fight scene between witches and our heroes, who are pretty incompetent as fighters go--they're constantly being taken by surprise when they shouldn't be and suffering injuries that really should kill them, no matter their heritage. After awhile we were thinking ""here we go again"" as soon as another battle scene flared up, and each time we were treated to more of the same thing we got in the previous battle scenes. All in all, a very forgettable film with much more gore than necessary and much less thought put into it than there should have been.",1462579200,4,891,4.717948717948718

There are no real trolls, although there are some here on Amazon. This is pure adrenaline entertainment and I think for the script that was given, the actors did a decent job. Famke did a fantastic job as the ""lead witch"". Jeremy and Gemma did a good job as well. My opinion. The 3D was awesome and to those that are whining about the packaging not saying the 3D is not the unrated edition, get a clue. It's clearly stated on the back cover: 3D BLU-RAY: Theatrical Version.
The 2D version Blu-ray  is the ""Unrated Edition"" with a few scenes added in.
""Hansel and Gretel"" is the ""reinvented"" story of the famous two that are locked up in a candy house by a witch. They get revenge on the witch by shoving her in her own oven, they grow up hating witches and vow to hunt every one of their kind down. Basic plot of the movie, but there is more to it than that. A ""Blood Moon"" is coming in which when sacrificing the town's children, many or all of the witches attending the ceremony could get special powers that would make them immune to spells, etc. The ""lead witch"" is enemy numero uno for the Witch Hunters and they make it their priority to track her down at every turn. They are not superhuman, so when fighting the witches, it's apparent. They do have some nice weapons of their own design to make their encounters more ""hunter friendly"". lol
Did I go in expecting an Oscar lead performance from the actors? No. Did I take it seriously thinking all these characters were based on real ones? No. It's fantasy entertainment. So, that is what I got out of it and I enjoyed it for that.
This 3 Disc set is pretty good for the price. I didn't get it online, I got it at the local retailer for less than 13 bucks. So, check around.
Menus and background music are great with easy selections.

4750107,3,B005LAIH2M,"Leather. Gore. Anachronistic steampunk weapons. Snarling witches. And a pair of classic fairy-tale characters who have become witch-hunting bounty hunters.

If that doesn't tip you off that this isn't a very serious movie, then maybe the title will: ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters."" Tommy Wirkola's first big Hollywood movie is strictly the kind of action-packed popcorn-for-the-brain that is fun to watch, as long as you don't take it too seriously. The biggest problem is that the movie never quite figures out if it's a tongue-in-cheek action movie or a dark comedy.

Once upon a time, Hansel and Gretel were abandoned in the woods by their parents, and ended up wandering over to a house made of candy. You know how the story goes -- there's a witch inside, she wants to eat Hansel, Gretel saves the day, and the witch is burned alive.

Happily ever after? Well, not exactly. Fifteen years later, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are leather-clad weapon-toting bounty hunters who specialize in witches, especially since spells don't affect them. The mayor of a small town hires them when children go missing, despite the meddling of the psychotic local sheriff and his band of goons.

After catching and offing a local witch, Hansel and Gretel discover that the witches are planning a massive sacrifice during a forthcoming Blood Moon. Even worse, the witches are led by a Grand Witch named Muriel (Famke Jansson) who knows the secrets of the siblings' past, and the true reason their parents abandoned them. Defeating her and her followers might be more than even Hansel and Gretel can handle.

My biggest problem with ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is that it never quite makes up its mind what it wants to be -- it's too serious to be a dark comedy, but still too tongue-in-cheek to be a straight action movie. It vacillates between the two extremes constantly. But either way, it's a fun brainless movie, with buckets of gore and anachronistic weapons (Hansel's love-interest Mina blasts witches with a FRICKING GATLING GUN!).

So if you expect a mindless, tongue-in-cheek gorefest, this movie will probably fit the bill. Is it a great movie? Not really. Is it fun? Yeah! It's not even trying to be ""authentic,"" so it succeeds wildly.

Wirkola is pretty obviously reveling in the ability to create a ""dark fairy tale"" with a firm R-rating. It could have used some subplot-pruning (Thomas Mann's ""fanboy"" character is just distracting), but the central tale is a pretty straightforward one. The fun comes from the one-liners (""I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket""), the B-movie stunts and sets, and the gore. Did I mention the gore? Because there's a lot of it, and it's fun.

Wirkola also seems to enjoy showing Renner and Arterton getting beaten up, because nearly every scene with ANY action involves them getting slammed into rocks, knocked senseless, and occasionally stabbed. The Grimm siblings certainly earn their money.

Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton honestly couldn't look any LESS like siblings, but both look like they're having a blast as leather-clad, cussing bounty hunters who constantly wave around absurd weapons (Hansel's hilariously phallic gun). They are perfectly suited to the dry, tongue-in-cheek approach of the script, and they even get some interesting character twists, such as Hansel suffering from diabetes because of his all-candy diet as a child.

""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is by no means a great film, but it is a resolutely fun one -- lots of splattered body parts, screeching witches and gleeful anachronisms. Turn off your brain and enjoy.",1447372800,,3651,5.029801324503311

But I WILL complain that I found the Blu-ray disc had been knocked loose in the case when I first opened it and had a couple of scuffs and scratches on it. Luckily it still seems to play just fine.

4750746,5,B005LAIH2M,"The title says it all! When I first rented this movie, I didn't know that Hansel & Gretel would, 15 years later, become witch exterminators and, in the process, become immune to witchcraft. I also found it interesting that, after the fiasco at the gingerbread house, Hansel becomes diabetic & needs a shot of insulin every few hours. I like the part when the two of them arrive in Augsburg and save Mina, who is a good witch, from being executed by the sheriff. One of my most favorite parts, though, is as Gretel's searching for Hansel and she gets ambushed & beaten up by the sheriff and his men, this ogre/witch servant named Edward comes to her rescue and beats up and kills the sheriff & his men. I also like the weapons that Hansel & Gretel use on the witches(machine guns, crossbows, etc.). I also found it amazing how Muriel, the Grand Witch, can change the look of her face, at will. Lastly, I like how, after defeating the witches in the climactic battles, Hansel, Gretel, Edward and this teenager named Ben, who's a fan of Hansel & Gretel, team up and continue disposing of evil witches. So, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action/fantasy movies or would like to see a twist on a childhood fairy tale because, believe me, this movie is AWESOME!!!",1440374400,4,1268,4.541484716157205

4751842,3,B005LAIH2M,"It was nothing like the original story. Hansel appeared to have diabetes and injected himself with insulin because of the amount of sugary food the original witch fed him. Additionally, Hansel and Gretel had multiple projectile weapons that either never ran out of ammunition, or had replacement magazines for them.

4752074,4,B005LAIH2M,"Not a bad movie.  As weak as the plot and tone of this movie is, and as implausible as people hundreds of years back possessing weapons similar to machine guns, I still found this film to be entertaining.

 Jeremy Renner & Gemma Arterton are brother and sister witch hunters who are armed to the teeth, wandering around old Europe hunting down the world's most wicked of witches outside of Oz (I assume they charge for their termination and hunting services).  No explanation is really given on how they got trained to fight and use this endless arsenal of weaponry.  They stumble upon one village that holds the secret to their youthful past, where Renner meets and falls in love with one of the ""good"" witches who is being attacked by these local village low lives.

 ""X-Men"" star Famke Janssen stars as the evil leader of the witches that the two heroes must take down.  Apparently MTV played a major hand in making this film.

The movie sets up for a sequel and pretty much acts as a shoot them up video arcade game film.  Unlike many movies of the 2010's which I find are over filled with too much CGI & plots containing a lot of political correctness, I was satisfied with this one because it fits for both older teens and adults (rated R for intense violence & graphic horror imagery) if those two elements had been toned down it may I been rated PG. In any case the action is comedic and very over the top.

No, but it really didn't have to be perfect or Academy worthy.  The premise was already one that lended itself to being a twist on literary fiction. The cinematography is great.  Renner in my opinion is a one-dimensional actor and it shows here.

I don't know why folks complain about action-horror-comedy movies as if they were intended to be educational, thought-provoking, or intellectually enriching.  If you look at the picture on the box of the two grown-up, leather-clad, weapons-laden bad-ass ""witch hunters"" - it pretty much tells you what you're in for.  I expected to be thoroughly entertained and I was.  Is it for the little kiddies? - not really.  And if I wanted to immerse myself in the cultural significance of Grimm's literature, I would watch a documentary about it on PBS - not a Rated R action movie.  Besides, the original story was published in 1812 about a witch luring two children into her home and trying to eat them - does anyone expect a 2013 ""sequel"" to be serve up anything but gore, blood, death, and destruction?!

4754405,3,B005LAIH2M,"Watched this for laughs through my Prime account.  Strictly a park your brain movie that starts with the rough outline of the famous fairy tale we all know.  Our heroes young Hansel and Gretel escape the clutches of the so-called Candy Witch and dispatch her leading them to make an obvious career choice to become witch bounty hunters.  Jeremy Renner must have owed someone a favor to take on the role of the diabetic (from OD'ing on sweets at the Candy Witch's cottage) Hansel.  I never heard of Gemma Arterton until this film but she looks fetching in tight leather pants and seems to be enjoying herself.  Famke Janssen plays the main villain, some sort of super witch who manages to keep a straight face spouting all sorts of mystical mumbo-jumbo. There's lots of CGI gore and a troll named Edward too.  You get plenty of anachronistic language (occasional F-bombs for example) and weapons that employ technology at least 100 years in the future of the setting.  Hansel even gives himself insulin injections!  I kept waiting for a witch to pull out an i-Phone.

Yeah, the movie is a little cheesy, but how can you ever figure what you are going to really like when it comes to a movie and the special effects. This is not an Academy Award winning movie, but I knew that and wasn't expecting that.  The thing is, I wasn't even really expecting to like it at all, much less enough to go out and buy it!!  The title doesn't do much to capture your attention that's for sure.  But the action is really intense, the characters are truly over-the-top, the characters make up and costumes are really fascinating to look at, the weaponry will knock your socks off to check out and watch on what it does and how it works...and don't even get me started about the special effects!!  This movie is a no-brainer for a Saturday night fun run.  It is truly just for pure entertainment with no thinking involved and knowing that it is not going to be a Tom Cruise flick or going to be nominated for any awards in any light of day!!!",1429747200,,1198,4.36036036036036

I enjoy the other work of both lead actors, but this one is a little schticky. It almost qualifies as a monster movie, or maybe a horror picture with a fairytale twist.

The movie is set in a strange era between the Medieval and the early Modern, and its prevailing technology is an odd mixture of mechanized crossbows and primitive muskets, all elaborately complex.

Since I realize we all have different preferences when it comes to movie genres I would say this would appeal most to the syfy/fantasy fans. When this was in theaters my husband, who likes action/adventure, but not syfy/fantasy so much, saw it and said it was mediocre...thus, I was in no rush to see it, but after reading some reviews here my interest was peaked. I did enjoy this movie and am sorry it got such a bad rap.  Plenty of action and adventure. While there is blood and gore (bodies blowing apart, etc.) that part was not as bad as most R rated movies are (I've seen worse on TV.) I would have done a PG-13 on this one (as long as it is not a squeamish 13 year old.)  The plot was better than I expected and was surprised by the twists they added to it.  I don't want to spoil your watching it, so I'll just say that there were enough twists and turns to keep it interesting throughout the movie. There were a myriad of interesting characters as well...and some were very surprising.  I wish they do a sequel....I liked it that much.",1427673600,,1113,4.260663507109005

It was more entertaining than staring at the TV while it was turned off, which makes it slightly better than the average film coming out of Hollywood these days.  If you have no life and time to kill this will fit the bill.",1427241600,,351,4.453125

4757388,2,B005LAIH2M,"I think that I may have missed the intent of the story plot.  I got to see the naked butt of a red-head white-witch that was saved from being drowned in a galvanized water troff or maybe burning at the stake by the evil sheriff.  She liked the story's hero and wanted to protect him.  I suppose I could have been thrilled if the nudity some how fit the unfolding story line.  I liked the troll named Edward the best.  He did the stuff that added flavor and glue to this movie.  Edward actually fit the plot though the original Hansel & Gretel had no such creature in the story.  There was probably a lot of witch blood and guts splattered all over the place in excess of what might have been really needed.  Gretel always had her hair and makeup in perfect condition.  As far as a tie to the original story?  The house of candy got into the script.  The old witch got shoved into the stove.  The remainder was somewhat far fetched.  If the story, except for the gore, was supposed to be easy on the eyes, then the red-head white-witch at the therapeutic pool would have to be it.  Gretel and the skin tight black leather pants just left one wondering who paid the dry cleaning bills.  Would I watch a sequel?  I suppose the resurrection of the red-head white-witch would help.  Of course, Edward, the troll, would have to be included.  Bad witches were plentiful so the killings and splattering of witch guts and gore could possibly go on forever.  Then there is this curiosity that Gretel brought into the story line..  Gretel, for no reason, just loved to use the ""F"" word.  This vulgarity is usually left to ugly females and manly males.  It did not help make the movie any better.  Even the ""F"" word can't do that in rap music so I am not sure why it was felt that it could make an improvement in this version of Hansel & Gretel.  The weaponry just did not fit the story line.  Having written that, I must say that the weapons included wands, knives, chains, automatic firearms and interesting explosives.  Thank goodness it was included with the prime membership; or, ""maybe NOT?""  I doubt that it would be the movie a reasonable parent would consider educational or with social redeeming value.  It is perfectly suitable for an adult that is bored and has nothing better to watch including TV.  I believe that I can safely say that some of the pharmaceutical advertisements with their audio trailers that explain the horrible side effects of their latest offerings are a bit more interesting as well as thought provoking giving one the opportunity to wonder who in their right mind would take something that is pretty much guaranteed to damage a human wishing only to avoid some annoying health issues.",1425081600,,2708,4.537190082644628

After roasting the candy-housed witch in the fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel grow up and become, surprise surprise, witch hunters.

What did I think?

We really need two rating systems. As a B-grade flick Hansel and Gretel is actually kind of enjoyable, even if it does suffer from a case of the takes itself too seriously by the end blues. But compare it to real movies and, well, lets just say Hansels diabetes, from eating too much candy as a kid, comes up more than once. Curse you diabetes!

From the script to screen and everything in between that went into the making of this movie was a waste of time.

Horrible acting saying equally horrible lines. This was by a movie studio that had no idea what movie making is. It was like someone with a lot of money who just gave it to his son in middle school do a hip retelling of a classic story. A good metaphor for this movie is when Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit did a remake of The Who's song Behind Blue Eyes. A bloody disaster!",1422662400,,603,4.145299145299146

Is Hollywood really so out of ideas that they're now taking classic fairy tales and turning them into action movies?  Seriously, when you think of Hansel and Gretel, what do you think of?  Well, I think of 2 little kids lost in the woods, scared and alone and finding a house made of candy and being held hostage by a witch and then they eventually kill the witch and get to safety.

Well this movie has that but only for like a minute, then it's on to non-stop action as they use steam-punk weapons to hunt down and destroy all witches everywhere!  Oh but they also have a fan-boy who has all the clippings from their adventures, and Hansel also has diabetes, oh and their mom was a witch too but she was a good witch.

Trust me, it's just as stupid as it sounds.  The only thing that made me want to see it was the fact that Jeremy Renner was in it.  But even he couldn't save this pile of celluloid garbage.

4758873,5,B005LAIH2M,"This movie is not what I expected. I went into this movie thinking it would be about as bad as that Red Riding Hood movie but hoping it'd be as good as Van Helsing. It's not really either, I'd almost compare it to Dredd. At no point does the movie pretend to be something it's not. It doesn't have a great story or some insane twist, but it is a fun religious sci-fi that has a lot of action and that I definitely enjoyed.

The pros of this movie
Good acting/actors
Decent story
Good effects
Good music

Cons
Doesn't excel in any particular aspect
Those hoping for something amazing will be disappointed
They don't explain where they get all their insane weapons
Not all sub plots are solved

This movie is not for everyone, there was less swearing than I expected and WAY more gore than I expected. Some things are done for the sole purpose of looking cool without having an explanation for why it would happen but not in a way that becomes irritating or annoying.

If you enjoy the TV show 'Supernatural' on the WB/CW, you will probably really enjoy this. If you hated the movie Dredd, you will probably hate this.",1420934400,,1116,4.429268292682927

I watched this a few months back so I can't recall EVERYTHiNG but I do know that I enjoyed it a little more than I should had. And like someone else said, yes I did feel a little guilty lol. It's a pretty interesting twist on the fairy tale and it includes some serious badas*ary as well as quirky come backs and really ridiculously ugly witches. I suppose had I went through what they went through I'd probably end up batshhhhcrazy and wanting to go around hunting witches too.

4758876,1,B005LAIH2M,"It is hard to watch this film.

I think that it is because it so badly mutilates the most basic concept of filmmaking:  A good film suspends the viewer's sense of disbelief.

Be it ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Star Wars"", or ""The Wizard of OZ""; you have to make the viewer think that he/she is somehow seeing something that is real.  Something that could actually happen.  Something that is believable.

But this is a story of how two children somehow morph into super-heroes with borderline-magical powers of 20th-century technology without any explanation in the storyline.  Then they go from town to town disposing of real ""bad guys"" while saving the innocents mistaken for evil-doers.  All of this is done in wearing apparel that really put them out pf place in their historical environment.

To the average viewer, one is overwhelmed with the task of trying to believe what one is seeing rather than enjoying the story - which is pretty lame in itself.

The mind boggles.

I have a confession:  I stopped watching around fifteen minutes into the film.  It is THAT bad.

To give you a better idea of what i mean, I recently saw ""The Interview"".  All of it.  It was a near thing about 10 minutes in.  I didn't know who I hated more - James Franco or his character.  But I soldiered on and eventually things got better and even enjoyable in a relative manner.  Hansel and Gretel, Witch Hunters sucked abysmally in comparison.

Their wit is as sharp as the knives they carry and the dialogue shoots on par with Shakespeare's finest. How this movie won zero awards, I'll never know.

(but it is unsuitable viewing for children)  There seems to be a bias against this film amongst the critics, and I can't figure out why. I've seen a lot worse movies than this get hailed by the critics.

It is refreshing to see Hansel and Gretel as anacronisms in a fairytale world.  It is the fact that they are armed with modern weapons and swagger while cursing like sailors, which makes this movie fun.  If they had tried to play the characters straight, then the movie would have been ridiculous.  And Gemma Arterton is very easy on the eyes.

Hansel and Gretel both form semi-romantic relationships with two other characters which are very touching and emotional towards the end.  The emotion rings true, it is not ridiculous.

Lately there is this constant supply of movies on historical stories, which are all altered in the same way: main characters look pretty, fight like Bruce Lee, have no fear and talk to much in fighting scenes. The only difference is in the name of the movie and decorations. This movie is probably the worst example I know. Visual effects are nicely done, hence 2 stars.",1419465600,,504,4.549450549450549

4761235,4,B005LAIH2M,"***MILD SPOILERS***  Surprised I liked this as much as I did, after reading a few of the negative reviews.  I thought it was inventive, gorgeous to look at it, and well-paced (though obviously heavy on action which got a tad repetitive at times).  I liked Hansel and Gretel's backstory.  I thought there was great chemistry between Gretel and Edward- will they hook up?  I'm not telling.

I deducted one star for a big pet peeve of mine, people from faraway realms and other times using modern American English and slang.  It was cute and well-done in Shrek, but I HATE it most other instances.  It's over-used and hackneyed, and, detracts from the wonder, the uniqueness of the world being created. Another egregious example is Once Upon a Time, wherein everyone comes from different worlds/dimensions with no prior contact, yet not only do they speak the SAME language, but it's modern day American English laced with slang from TV shows, movies etc.- what are the odds?

Some might think suspending disbelief in this regard is the same as overlooking the use of modern weapons in this movie, not so, IMO.  Opting for modern weapons is a simple plot point choice.  It betokens sheer LAZINESS and/or lack of talent when writers don't take the time to craft language to complement the world being created or the filmmaker's vision.  And characters can be funnier, more irreverent and mold-breaking by NOT saying ""OK"", ""You WISH"" ""Do tell!"" ""Yeah right"" etc.

Other than that I thought it was quite a thrill ride, with good special effects, acting, and charismatic leads.  A fun way to spend a couple of hours.",1417910400,,1609,4.824817518248175

4761742,3,B005LAIH2M,"Be forewarned, this film is no Avengers/X-Men, Princess Bride, or Lord of the Rings, which are far beyond this film's reach. This film is on a much lower tier, sharing space with films such as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Brothers Grimm, and Van Helsing. It's a ""brain on autopilot"" adventure film that feels more like a 90-minute pilot for a series than a film in its own right. And that, right there describes the film both in terms of strengths and weaknesses. While there is character development at work, it feels more akin to the character growth you'd see on a tv show, both siblings learning not to be so judgmental (or at least befriending the ""white sheep"" of an enemy flock), resulting the formation of ""the team"" seconds before the end of the film. Compare it to Buffy's ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest."" It's a launching point for future growth, but not a final destination. Television is written this way inherently whereas the same style of writing in a film feels like it has been done in half measures. Even when a film is destined for a sequel (or just sequel baiting), there needs to be a palpable impact that the events of the narrative have had on its characters. The stakes need to feel like life or death. The film's leads really aren't changed significantly from their experiences, ergo the audience isn't changed.",1417219200,,1350,4.748936170212766

4762837,4,B005LAIH2M,"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters
 Ok, if you liked Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter you should like Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters even more.  There are a couple of famous movie stars in the film for one thing and there is a very warm and cuddly troll that you just want to go hug.  So thats fun.  If you want a film to just relax and watch the pictures go by and put your brain in the bread box, this is for you.  People love it and made it number one on the charts this week.
 Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola has made his first big time movie and it seems to be a hit.  He had a budget of $50 million to work with and he spent it on cool special effects and nice paydays for his stars.  This is a big change from his previous small budget Zombie film, Dead Snow.  Zombie flick fanciers like Dead Snow as perhaps the finest Norwegian Dead Nazi Zombie film ever made.  And it was done on a farthing.  Wirkola also wrote the script for Hansel and Gretel as he did Dead Snow.
 Up and coming super star Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker, The Town) plays Hansel.  Renner is now an accomplished action hero, which is just what this role calls for.  Hansel and Gretel parleyed their childhood success as witch killers into a career as a sort of bounty hunters- witch killers for hire in early modern Germany.  Gemma Arterton, a 26 year old with a long string of roles in both TV and film, has the role of Gretel.  She looks great in skin tight leather pants, which is all that is asked to her in terms of acting.  This is not an actors movie; it is a special effects guys movie.
 Framke Janssen, who wowed fans as Jean Grey in the X-Men films, is the evil witch.  The witches in Hansel and Gretel have extensive and deadly magical powers and Janssen wields them with lan.  Also featured is Wirkolas fellow Norwegian Ingrid Bolso Berdal.  Berdal is an award winning actor.  Her two big assignments in Hansel and Gretel are to frolic naked in a pool with lucky Jeremy Renner and to machinegun a band of witches to pieces with an electric chain gun that somehow became available in 17th century Germany.  Who cares?  In this kind of a movie you expect jarring stuff to happen but if it results in spectacular destruction of a huge gang of kiddy killing magic wielders, so much the batter.
 This average three saw blade action flick is rated R for violence, exploding witches and a good long look at the lovely Ingrid Bolso Berdal.  Director/writer Tommy Wirkola looks to be able to return his producers $50 million.  The first week worldwide gross of $59 million is a good start.",1414454400,,2565,4.367864693446089

Well, so, the story is prett lame. I won't go on, many have done it already. The part I hated the most was how poorly they integrated the red head. She appeared solely to show some skin and help out hansel who apparently isn't a very good witch hunter. And, he lets her die - the director of the movie, the writers - they all let her down. I don't know why they let the worthless kid join their merry band of witch hunters at the end but not the red-headed white witch. Right? Gretel picked up a wand and it glowed at the end of the movie - she should have helped the red head. Hell, Hansel should have tried to see if she was still alive, but he didn't seem to care.

The actors seem to be having a lot of fun and it's nice that it had steered away from any big names, all involved from the main two, to the witches, sheriff and other villains, all do a good job.  The makeup on the witches is also well done, there's a nice special feature about this as an extra.  This film changes the basic premise of the dumping of the children, stays loyal to the events of the candy house then shows us what the brother and sister went on to do afterwards.  It's a fun film to watch, it likely never won any awards, but this type of film just needs to entertain and it does just that.  Give it a go.",1413936000,,728,4.062937062937063

4763312,4,B005LAIH2M,"I avoided this movie because it was panned by the critics-- it got something like a 15 percent approval rating.  To put it in perspective, Star Trek:  Into Darkness got an 87 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  I don't even want to know what The Avengers or the Transformers got.  Since I consider the movies I named almost unwatchable, I assumed Hansel and Gretel would be a train wreck.  I'm leery of saying Amazon reviewers got it right-- after all, they gave Witches of East End 4.7 stars and Breaking Bad 4.6 stars.  But mainly, I'm frustrated with critics.  They should be more representative of the population and not make guesses about what they think the masses will like, which is what I think happened here.

This review is more geared towards the critics and those who left nasty reviews.  Although I won't give spoilers, some of my comments may spoil some of the fun and surprise of the movie.  I wouldn't recommend reading any further unless you've either seen the film or got disgusted by it and turned it off after fifteen minutes and need some convicing...

The critics were right in pointing out an inconsistent mood.  There's a hodgepodge of different styles of action, which I suppose for some may seem schizophrenic.  The steampunk weapons for instance:  They weren't realistic and seemed like something out of a video game.  True steampunk should have a feeling of functionality.  Through gears and steam, the encumbered device should do roughly the same as the modern counterpart.  However, it is all too easy to get stuck in steampunk and make the entire movie about the devices (Wild, Wild West).  I wish the devices were more clever, but I understand why they weren't.

The critics probably didn't like the Ogres.  I thought they were the best part of the film because you didn't know quite what to make of them.  Initially, you were supposed to laugh at them (like the androids in Star Wars), but then the ogres would club a guy in the noodle and his head would explode like a watermelon.  It caught me off guard and I laughed my a-- off.

With every witch movie I've seen, they're always seen as decrepit crones and there's only a few around at once.  I've never seen an army of them.  If I controlled an army of witches or had a division of flying carpets, I'd absolutely use them as WWII-type dive bombers.  The critics probably didn't like that this WWII motif didn't extend throughout the movie.  They would probably enjoy it if, in Scary Movie fashion, they dropped black cats onto the heads of the villagers and the cats scratched people in the face and then ran away, unscathed.  Or they would have appreciated a witch dressing up as Patton as they stupidly overextend the WWII metaphor.  It's silly, mindless, and entertaining to have witches use their broomsticks as bombers and anything further would have cheapened it.  It's not a gag exactly, nor is it satire.  It's just silly and cool.

The storyline with the brother and sister witch hunters was also silly and fun.  They're not generic heroes like in the Mummy, nor are they dark antiheroes like in the Dark Knight.  You aren't supposed to put yourself in their shoes, or root for them as underdogs, or whatever it is that people do.  You're just supposed to enjoy the ride.  I'm psyched that they're doing a sequel.  I can only hope that the writers didn't take any of the critics' verbal diarrhea to heart.

The charmed brother and sister (mysteriously immune to sorcery) have since come of age and now brandish a nice collection of weapons they use to hunt and dispatch these malevolent witches that haunt the various woodland areas. The protagonists hero and sister heroin are nearly as cruel as the antagonist witches that they so adeptly dispatch but always for the good though at times it didn't seem that way. The story is symmetrical in nature in that the seemingly random encounters lead to self-discovery and the timely confrontation with a prominent and powerful witch who intends to use magic to change the world as we know it into darkness but can only be accomplished on a particularly day and time underneath a blood red moon.  Although the story drags one to its conclusion, the script is sadly weak and does little justice to the actor and actress that do a reasonable job of maintaining believability.",1412380800,,1283,4.8054298642533935

4763462,5,B005LAIH2M,"Don't get me wrong - this movie is bad. It's so bad, it's fun. That's what I love about it. Are there problems? Oh yes - from Edward's really bad make-up/effects to the cheese-ball dialogue to the ""sugar sickness"" to Gretel suddenly becoming a damsel in distress halfway through the film; there are problems.

But there's fun. The make-up/effects for the witches is great. The banter/battles of Hansel & Gretel are pretty kick ass for the most part. And Jeremy Renner runs around being a BAMF in black leather for the majority of the film.

It's not meant to be an Oscar winner. It's a rock-and-roll soundtrack re-imagined version of Hansel & Gretel. Enjoy it for what it is and don't think about it too much.",1412294400,,709,4.619047619047619

Yes, as noted by other reviewers, there are anachronisms galore, but that's part of the humor about the whole thing.  Nobody's pretending that this movie is supposed to be a period piece and this movie doesn't take itself seriously in that sort of way.  But if you like zombie movies, and you like comedy, then you're really going to like this hybrid.

I found this film to have some interesting things and some not so interesting. It had many things going for it. A cool premise. Excellent actors. Delicious visuals.

What didn't work was the excessive swearing. Don't get me wrong, I swear excessively lol but it really didn't work for a film set in a fairy tale land from long ago. Also, they tried to introduce futuristic weaponry which also felt really out of place. The witches, while some were interesting many were not. All in all it's a guilty pleasure but probably not a film I'd revisit outside of the Halloween season. It's worth a rental but it's nothing game changing.",1411948800,2,651,4.660869565217391

Now, I think I would have enjoyed it even more with a full audience reacting to all the crazy, gory action.  This is a terrible movie, but really fun to watch!  I like the little twist in the story -- very much like other recent fairy tale movies.  As long as you are prepared for some pretty gross decapitations, dismemberments, and other gruesome forms of death, this is an interesting retelling of the H&G story.",1408579200,,521,4.395833333333333

4764845,4,B005LAIH2M,"First off, I think this movie delivers everything an avid moviegoer can expect from those titles doomed to January theatrical release dates. I put this in the same category as The Brothers Grimm, perhaps because of the ridiculously hammy performance by Peter Stormare--who could almost be charged with reprising his own performance here. It twists something familiar into the mash-up genre; though these results were far superior and less serious than Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. There's a talented cast, spearheaded by the lovely Gemma Arterton. She runs away with the film, by my measure, while Jeremy Renner turns in another anti-hero with hints of comic flare. As much as I enjoyed the gist of the story, it was bogged down by flaws. As I've noticed in several other movies, accents and modern language mean nothing. The effects make up for it, especially between the witches and the ogre. That said, the film goes wildly overboard in its depiction of violence toward/against women. While there is plenty of true-to-life violence associated with the witch hunts, it would've been nice to not see it glorified. There are a few frightening sequences, as well as a couple of cringe-worthy moments, but this retelling of the legend had more than a few clever twists. I'd recommend this one only to fans of the performers.",1408233600,,1326,5.031818181818182

4766089,1,B005LAIH2M,"There is nothing wrong with fantasy -- it can, with the right touch, rise to soul-stirring story, as in Tolkien. But this pathetic production limps along without any dramatic build up, w/o any suspense. Much like a computer game: shoot and slash, next scene: shoot and slash. Renner and Arterton were fully wasted as actors. Actually none of the actors, except maybe the Grand Witch, are convincing of anything. There is a brief love scene, with rear nudity, that so lacked chemistry that it was like watching a seventh grader asking for a first dance. Embarrassingly awkward.

What is fun about a fantasy world is that the viewer gets to participate/explore in an entirely unknown world with different laws and realities. But this only works if the author/director stays within whatever framework he set up. For example, perhaps a minor point -- the movie is set in a medieval time, yet the two witch hunters have weapons using mechanisms that were only possible by the 1860s plus. That might (?) be tolerable if the same technology was evident elsewhere in the city of Augsburg, but it's not. And then, what is surprising is how lousy these two are as witch hunters. Three times before the finale we watch them catch a witch, fully get the drop on her, and within seconds the said witch easily tricks them, turns the tables, and now they have a full-blown fight-to-the-death battle on their hands. I suppose, lacking the ability to build suspense in the full arc of a story, the screenplay tries to pep things up these (repeated, finally predictable which equals boring) close calls. And strangely -- their weapons, when they aren't dropping them or the witches are flicking them away, do not seem very effective against witches (until at the end when they have been enchanted). The movie shows us an album full of their hundreds of successes, but with their incompetence, how could that be?

And then a minor point: there is a scene with the two hunters walking through a somewhat airy woods and they pass a very gnarled fallen tree or limb. But if you look in the background, you will see no other tree trunks of this type, indeed, the trees there are mere saplings. Are we looking at two different woods? The artificiality of the scene screams: ""set""!!!

But then, the whole movie seems a half-hearted effort, perfunctory -- the director was hoping geez-whiz special effects would by themselves create a story. Sorry, they don't. I was 65 minutes into the story, right at the beginning of the big battle finale, and when the white witch pulls out a Gatling gun, I gave up and turned it off.

It doesnt try to be a good movie. Its more of a showcase for special effects. Jeremy Renner doesnt even try to fake a European accent, and most of the other actors have various accents that don't make sense for wherever in Europe this story takes place in.

If you have seen Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman, this is essentially the same movie, but with different actors and witches as villains.

Fortunately, this movie does not throw the kitchen sink at you!

Wonderful visuals - we especially warmed to the love-struck [?] troll - a delightful touch of misplaced - but corrected loyalty.  Perfect costume design by Marlene Stewart - and great [intelligent] props too - more or less period re-inventions of a few mod cons ...

If anyone has ever seen trollhunter you  know there are parts of this film that have the same sort of feel. The realistic blood parts were cool too. THey actually could make a whole movie like that with the special effects, but I see they chose to go with a more tasteful well rounded approach. I very much enjoyed this action adventure remake of hansel and Gretel. The plot was there along with the characters, acting, action sequences, and gore. They could have done more with weaponry but I feel that did an adequate enough job. Jeremy and Gemma did a great job and Gemma is of course beautiful but sometimes she bothers me in certain roles, here I felt she did a very nice job.

4766953,4,B005LAIH2M,"I'll say it again: Buffy has much to answer for. Because of that show every supernatural beastie now seems to throw down with the kung fu. HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS gleefully subscribes to this trend. But at least it's a movie that's very much self-aware and tongue-in-cheek. It's the best thing about it, its irreverent approach.

""We learned a couple of things while trapped in that house,"" remarks Hansel's voiceover narration. There's an early scene that details young Hansel and Gretel's terrifying sojourn at the witch's candy house and how they survived that. 15 years later and a years-spanning montage later, we reconnect with the now adult siblings. In this reimagined medieval Germanic setting, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are become this infamous pair of wisecracking, f-bomb dropping bounty hunters. They're what passes as the Middle Ages' version of rock stars. Rock stars armed with holy water and heavy artillery.

This hamlet's mayor has contracted Hansel and Gretel to track down the local witch what's been abducting children, much to the chagrin of the territorial sheriff (Peter Stormare). Expect this a-h01e peacekeeper to undermine our heroes at every opportunity while leading his own witch hunt.

We learn the importance of the impending eclipse of the moon (or ""blood moon"" if you're feeling poetic), of how it ushers in dark possibilities that surface only once in a generation. The nasty witch Muriel (Famke Janssen) means to further the witches' cause. It may require a sacrifice or two at the witch's sabbath, like the life of a good grand witch. And this is probably a SPOILER, but did you know that Gretel's mom is good grand witch? Can you follow the road map?

So this movie wanders far away from its fairy tale source material. Doesn't make it bad. HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is one of them guilty pleasures that I don't think I should feel guilty about. It's another genre stew that retrofits historical figures or classic fairy tales. Norwegian writer/director Tommy Wirkola messes about with anachronism as if it's the newest coolest thing. Modern-day speak. Gatling guns. Medieval defibrilators. Hansel's having to periodically inject himself because of his diabetes. The banter amused me, such as Gretel about to administer a smackdown on one evil witch but first politely informing her: ""I hate to break it to you, but it's not going to be an open casket."" Heh. So, yeah, unlike VAN HELSING or LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER, this movie owns a wicked sense of humor about itself. It's got more in common with ARMY OF DARKNESS with its tongue-in-cheek sensibilities. The cast is a lot of fun to watch, namely our two leads and also Thomas Mann, who plays an eager lad what's been tracking the careers of and collecting fan boy material on Hansel and Gretel. Famke Janssen has fun being over-the-top. Stormare has fun being petty and despicable. And the whoever is playing Edward, the troll with the emo eyes, is pretty damn boss.

So it's loud. It's vulgar. It's violent and super-bloody and awfully gory. It's vaguely steampunk. Our two leads wear their leather pants with pride and with swagger. Yeah, son, it speaks to my inner juvie. The action is wildly outrageous, with an inventive assortment of witches, all of whom come off as formidable and wily and seemingly down with kung-fu. But Hansel and Gretel will match up their kickass arsenal of witch-killing weapons (cough***friggin'gatlinggun***) against them vile crones every time. With a running time of an hour and a half, this sucker doesn't wear out its welcome. And, again, it so unabashedly embraces its attitude and humor and its use of anachronism that it's got a great shot of winning you over.",1401840000,,3731,5.001610305958132

Hansel and Gretel are now adults, and after successfully conquering their first witch as children, are full-blown witch hunters.  Creative idea in my opinion.  I also like how they had Hansel have diabetes from all the candy he was forced to eat as a child.  The movie itself was pretty entertaining.  It had plenty of death, the special effects were pretty good, and it was very action packed.  I was hesitant to watch it at first, but after starting it, I actually ended up enjoying it.

4767050,2,B005LAIH2M,"This is a B-movie's B-movie.  It's not intentionally terrible, but it doesn't work.  Tonally uncertain -- is it a comedy? an action-adventure? a fairy tale for edgy grown-ups? -- it doesn't achieve any of those.  There are some self-aware jokes, but no sense of self-awareness; it is off-handedly violent, but without the gruesome relish of a good horror movie. Continuity errors are so frequent they come off more as neglect than mistake. The only relationship that felt ""real"" was the brother-sister; characters are introduced to be killed in the next scene or (worse) never seen again.

This might add up to a great movie for 11-year-old kids -- chaste violence and sex (one naked woman's behind and lots of Gemma Arterton's cleavage and legs, Jeremy Renner's naked chest and an awkward one-line ""sex/romance"" scene in a bathing pool).  But kids that age shouldn't be exposed to the confused attitudes towards women -- all ugly women are evil (and they are ugly in a vast variety of ways); beautiful women (beautiful in the same way) are good, but rare, and weak -- and all women but the heroine die.  In a world where even ugly (male) trolls are shown as friendly and worth saving, the subtext about basic femaleness is dangerous.

Too bad, however -- it's a great premise (would make a great tv series), and Arterton and Renner could carry a franchise -- if the world were expanded beyond ""see ugly woman and kill her"" and the scripts were better.",1401235200,,1452,4.784

There are a few interesting little anomalies in this picture. Hansel is apparently a diabetic and gives himself injections, of insulin? They never say, but insulin is a fairly new medication, didn't exist back then.

They never quite let on when back then was, but I looked up the Brothers Grimm, and they published this story in 1812. Late 18th century? Early 19th, newest it could be. Guns and gun powder did exist then, but I'm not too sure about the Gatling guns and repeating rifles and factory-milled ammunition they are using. They look and sound swell, but for the period, they are silly.

This movie is definitely not fit for kids. There are too many gruesome and scary scenes ; probably PG-13 is the youngest should see this one. However, for those of us who can handle the occasional action flick, this fits the bill. I would watch it again if in the mood.",1400803200,,1070,4.4213197969543145

4767165,4,B005LAIH2M,"I enjoyed this twist of the old Hansel & Gretel fairy-tale.  It's a nice action-packed adult version of the story, much more realistic in showing Renner's version of what happened to the childrens Mother & Father when they were little; as well as how being traumatized into eating all that candy resulted in Hansel developing the ""sugar-sickness"" as they put it, (better known as Type-2 Diabetes), that resulted in Hansel needing those hypodermic insulin needles.  This is much more realistic in teaching younger viewers the sad reality about the dark-side of consuming too many sweets for too many years, regardless of whether you're forced to do it---or you're just a glutton for it on your own.

They've also got great fighting skills, along with some of the baddest weapons I've seen in a minute!  I also really liked the ogre Edward.  I never could see him as a so-called ""Troll"" because he was just too darn big!  =D  Yet he had a very lovable, protective nature, and clearly knew right from wrong.  So I was really glad to see that Edward ends up with a ""happy"" ending at the conclusion of the movie.

Last but not least, if the slaughtering of demonic-witches (NOT the Light-Witches) in a multitude of gruesome ways disturbs you, then this movie is not for you, as plenty of them meet a well-earned butchering in this motion-picture.

It has a interesting storyline that includes a test of the main characters convictions, causing a little soul searching for the witch hunters. Several dark humor moments are refreshing.  Minimal use of strong language.  Lots of fast paced action.  I enjoyed it and have watched it several times.

From a guys point of view the lovely ladies, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen, and Pihla Viitala keep your interest throughout the film.

If you manage to sit thru the entire thing (it took me two sittings because it was that bad), you'll discover they'd hoped to produce Hansel and Gretal as a series. Thankfully, I believe the viewing public's lack of enthusiasm for this rotten tomato squelched that idea. The story was STUPID and even from a fantasy standpoint, barely watchable. I would say if you like lots of gross violence perpetrated on some ugly and bizarre witches, but no good storyline or even likable characters, then this might be a movie for you.

I recognized the first two minutes of the story after that it was all  glorified witch hunters, thank god they had a concept of good witch bad witch at least Hansel did.

4767490,1,B005LAIH2M,Terrible script and acting. Don't waste your time watching this. It's hard to figure out if this movie is taking place in the 1800's or more recent.  The way people speak and act is out of sync with when this story was supposed to have taken place. The plot is very thin and this is just another Hollywood movie where they try to squeeze in as much violence and death as they can.

In the beginning, I was a bit confused at what was going on, but it is explained to us, later in the movie.  I thought the movie could have been a bit more graphically bloody, but there are a few really nice scenes.  1 was about a guy and some trees, and the other was around the end of the movie in the woods.

4767679,1,B005LAIH2M,"In the annals of truly execrable fantasy/action flicks, this piece of sewage rises above all the other festering floaters to achieve an incomparable stench. It is the pinnacle of bowl-swirling revulsion ... the triumph of the fecal over the feasible. If anyone doubts that our present society of lobotomized, nihilistic sociopaths is on the ascendency, gaze at the positive reviews for this wretched cinematic slap in the face of coherence and doubt no longer.

To begin, the idea was actually outstanding: storybook faves Hansel and Gretel survive their gingerbread nightmares to grow-up and become avid witch-destroyers. So many reasonable, exciting, funny, ironic, satirical, scary and even MEDIOCRE things could have been done with that basic plot-line alone, but this Stew of Stool-Samples fails to even hit the level of mediocrity.

The dialogue is ludicrously bad: it was clearly written by the kind of 21 year-old college graduates who emerge still utterly illiterate from their ""educational"" years, probably with degrees in Pole-Dancing or The Sociological Implications of XBox Character Motivation. Indeed, this ghastly piece of brain-sludge plays-out like a cheap video game from the early '90s, designed by bored Japanese gamers trying to approximate an American fairy tale after reading a synopsis translated from English into Sanskrit into Chinese into Japanese and then back into English.

The action sequences are juvenile and just plain disconnected from any remotely purposeful trajectory. The entire pacing is arbitrary and dimwitted. The performances are colossally repugnant -- all of them. The CGI is half-baked. The witches look like diseased wax-figures in need of a free clinic. The story is a mangled piece of pork gristle. And Famke Janssen ... Oh, Famke J is looking awfully embarrassed, here, and deservedly so. Someone clearly needed a check and needed it bad. She sleepwalks through this travesty without even the decency to camp it up since it's obvious everyone is going down into the aqueduct that leads directly to Hell's Central Sewage-Treatment Plant, anyhow. But who can blame her? One hopes she was heavily sedated during the ""filming"" of this barrel of sun-burned fish-guts. I watched her hit her pathetic marks during this ""movie"" and truly imagined her fighting with the director -- screaming and begging and scratching her own face in anguish after seeing the rushes:

""PLEASE, can I do this whole movie in the cheap CVS Drugstore Halloween mask so the crowds of ill-bred millennial spawn drooling into their popcorn will never know it's ME?""

Too bad for you, Famke, and too bad for humanity. Our Entertainment Culture receives yet another nail in its already overloaded coffin. And there's going to be a sequel because this one was so WELL-RECEIVED.

One star is given for the set-designers, who seem to have been the only people who believed they were actually getting paid to do a legitimate job in the making of this bewildering atrocity.

Long live the Stupids of the world! (Because the more they multiply, the easier it becomes for the Rest of Us to stay far, far away from them and their ""creations"".)",1398556800,2,3153,5.182711198428291

Despite the sort of cheesiness and predictability, the writing is actually pretty good.  Acting and shooting is good, it's probably about the best you can do with this concept.

5 stars because even though the idea itself was pretty bad they were able to make an entertaining movie out of it somehow and I respect that.",1397692800,,480,4.678571428571429

Filled with modern humor and lingo, Hansel & Gretel completely breaks the illusion of taking place in what the environment suggests is the Middle Ages. If this wasn't enough, the two are fully equipment with a high-tech, witch-hunting arsenal (including, of course, a Gatling gun).

4768222,2,B005LAIH2M,"My perverse pleasure in finding a movie made with such unpretentious intention (greed) was matched only by my joy in ruminating on how consistently the moviemakers squandered expensive special effects and fairy dream settings on an incontinent plot rife with anachronism and expediency. One can imagine the seminal day in pre-production wherein the brain colony synchronistically flatulated what they believed to be a story line and moral dilemma, involving medieval houses of candy, Gattlin guns, witch gangs and killer orphans (leave no pre-pubescent button unpushed, or rather, no zit unsqueezed). Throw in to the cauldron randomly generated witch lore to prop up the scatalogical epistle of events and we are left with a jello sausage limping along with the help of a walker.
The actors were gorgeous, disturbingly so, though the troll reminded me of a neighbor. They needed the paycheck. Who can blame them? One can empathize, but soneone's neck needs to be stretched for this one.
Don't get me wrong, I was entertained, enthralled by speculating on the subconscious message of time- lapse aging female faces into cracked and withered facades. Tittilated by witches on low-altitude broomsticks who reminded me of imperial storm troopers whizzing between forest trees. Entranced by plot turns more hypnotic than a cobra's dance (aka, well of course your dead mother was a white witch, too good to do harm and that's why witches' spells roll off you like water off a rain-x windshield).
In the end the only spell cast in this movie was from Famke's Muriel over my lapping tongue! But then again, I'm partial to brunettes!
I am reminded of Scrooge's retort when challenged to show some Christmas spirit to the poor, and I paraphrase, ""Are there no prisons?"" For writers, I mean, for screenplay writers (and movie producers)?

While the colors were vibrant, the cinematography crisp and the costumes nice, the film was so heavy with special effects and bizarre weaponry the plot and nuances were relegated to minor roles (excuse the pun).

This doesn't make sense for siblings that have spent their lives killing witches. You would expect them to have learned more fighting skills along the way. Maybe they should have learned from Abe Lincoln, the vampire slayer. Otherwise it was an ok movie to kill time with.",1396396800,,404,4.704225352112676

This was a very interesting twist on the Fairy Tale, although I will say the brothers Grimm's stories were never tame either. I understand they are not making a sequel, too bad I liked this very much and could definitely  see a series.

I didn't expect it to be great but I'm such a fan of Gemma Arterton that I wanted to watch it so, I stuck with it and was pleasantly surprised. It takes the story of Hansel and Gretel and rather than end it with the witch in the furnace, we meet grown up Hansel and Gretel busy at their chosen careers.

I liked that the director showed some of the fight scenes in the bright light of day. Most movies like this always have the fight scenes in the middle of the night and at least with me, I can't see everything that's going on because it's shot so darn dark. The movie was appropriately gory but not as terrible as you might expect. I wouldn't let small children or impressionable people see it.

Don't watch it expecting to see a deep meaningful movie, watch it because you want to see something that's just fun, well acted and to finally see special effects that are really good and are a part of the movie rather than being the whole movie.",1396310400,,1032,4.155

There was just no story to it and the characters were totally unbelievable and really hard to relate to.  This story was lacking anyone worth rooting for and no one was really sympathetic.  I had to give it to Jeremy Renner who I am sure was in it for the pay check but still managed to be the most human character in the story.  As the leader of the witches Famke Janssen was also very good and she could just be silly as the villainess.

The plot was literally black and white. After the Hansel and Gretel. the character with the most depth and emotion was a Troll.

For older children and for watching some cool effects it was okay. Oh, did I mention the special effects they show in all the advertising has nothing to do with what happens in the film and is more an advertisement for the a sequel.",1395446400,,762,4.521739130434782

The twist on an old fairy tale is nothing new and any correlation to the origin story is purely coincidental. The action and special effects are used often and are entertaining; however, they are not quite top notch. The acting was fair; no complains but I would not nominate any awards for the acting. The real weak point of this movie was the plot and the twists, actually lack thereof any surprises. There are dozens of movies similar in style, plot, etc. and if you are going to make another one, at least try to differentiate your film from others. If you are looking for suggestions, try The Brothers Grimm with Heath Ledger and Matt Damon, or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Those are both better movies, in my opinion, than Hansel and Gretel. The story is predictable and has all the poster signs of the fantasy genre including foes turned allies unexpectedly, evil witches with a much more devious scheme than anticipated, angry townsfolk who the heroes are trying to save in spite of their resentment and suspicion towards the hunters... yet it is still a decent flick if you like this type of movie and have an hour and a half to kill watching a movie.

Blood and gore and much moreBe ready to suspend your sense of reality for this 21st century interpretation of a tried and true children's story. This version pits a really nasty witch against the fair Gretel and the diabetic Hansel, the dynamic brother and sister slayers of wayward witches. Hansel and Gretel establish a formidable reputation going from town to town in the middle ages killing witches with marvelous high tech tools. Oh that cross bow!  In the last town featured in this film, they encounter an evil sheriff who is more interested in undermining their efforts and in taking over the town from the mayor who has invited Hansel and Gretel than is saving children who are mysteriously disappearing in advance of a rare lunar event. Interested yet? Can Hansel and Gretel save the day or will the wicked witch and her coven overcome them? Watch the movie to find out and to find out more about the origins of the brother and sister.

As for the movie it was of course pure fantasy but still very entertaining.  The storyline was easy to follow and the special effects were outstanding.  The script, however, was pretty lame and the acting was hit and miss; Jeremy Renner seemed lost at time and IMO was not a good choice for the part.  Gemma Arterton was lovely and very appealing even without any romantic elements in her direction.  The one bit of romance between Hansel and an attractive white witch never really developed (even though she sacrified herself for him) and in the end dismissed as if it never happened.  Famke Janssen was terrific as the witch, a part that required tons of energy.  I'm not sure who the movie was aimed at; it was too scary and violent for kids plus there is a brief nude scene; but at the same time it was probably too illogical to appeal to most adults (modern machine guns in medieval times?).  Which leaves teenagers I guess.  There was a hint of a possible sequel at the end but so far I haven't heard anything on it.  All in all I enjoyed the movie, though three stars is probably generous.  But if you're in the mood for some off-the-wall entertainment and open to using your imagination then the little kid (teenager) in you should enjoy this one.",1395014400,,1394,4.492063492063492

You never get a real sense of the characters, but the pockets of humor are pretty funny and you can never have enough witch heads exploding.

I should move the ratings to a possible ten but for now it is a one through five. Very few makes it to the five but this will come close. I give it the 4 1/2 bag award. Good suspense, good visual effects and good story line.

My problem is taking a child's fairy tale and turning it into a mega-scary movie that some parents may think, ""Oh, that was a cute story from my childhood."" It is a grown-up fright fest that made me jump once or twice, but kept the creepy juices flowing all through the movie.

It caught me by surprise. So if you are old enough to be creeped out and still sleep at night you may find this a great movie.",1394064000,,770,3.987012987012987

However, like a lot of movies these days, it was filmed ""dark"" (lots of night scenes and just dark backgrounds, etc.) and for old eyes, not so easy to watch (only reason for a 4 instead of a 5).

They use modern weapons, the acting isn't great (credit where it's due to Gemma Arterton for putting in a good performance amidst a sea of 'meh'), and the plot is as predictable as the sunrise.
  But here's the thing: This movie was executive produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. Meaning all those things are most likely intentional as send-ups to the other instalments in this genre.  Watch this as an intentionally bed, camp send-up of all the other dark-gritty-reboot of a classic tale films and it makes a lot more sense.  Still not fantastic, but if you can laugh along with it's over-the-topness and it's incredibad seriousness, you'll have an entertaining hour and a piece.",1393804800,,778,4.871212121212121

Not one to add to my collection personally.  YMMV",1393286400,,365,4.013888888888889

Just like the movie Van Helsing that came out a few years back, this movie is an action take on what in the past would have been horror or fantasy. I saw the previews and thought it would be stupid, but it was actually a great deal of fun! I suppose this might say more about my taste than the movie itself (I'm a fan of B movies), but I do believe most people would enjoy this flick if they just relax and overlooked (enjoyed?) the many, many liberties the film makes with fantasy tropes.",1393286400,,524,4.147058823529412

4771541,4,B005LAIH2M,This movie has a double twist. Not your idea of a children's story (of course the original story was quite gruesome if you think about it). This movie somehow portrayed blood and guts with a humorous twist. Kind of like Dr. Who television series. You gotta be into this kind of movie to enjoy it. Probably not for younger children.,1393027200,,331,4.533333333333333

It was just stupid. The story could've been awesome and the storyline itself was probably decent. The problem was having it set in the days of yore and speaking like its modern times. I mean come on! It completely ruined it.,1392940800,,398,4.32

This movie is so interesting and action packed with really well written plots and characters.  The costuming is world class and so are the cg's ... Very believable.  (Except the main star guy haircut/grooming looks very 2014 modern)... They should've given him some scruff around the jaw and grown his hair a touch.

However, eventually my love for fairytales and appreciation for the work of Famke Jansen and Jeremy Renner overrode it and I am glad it did.  The special effects could have been better (I'm assuming a bigger budget would have had a difference), but the movie itself was well laid out, thoughtful, funny, exciting, and never lost sight of the plot.  In fact, I thought the plot-twist about their mother was rather ingenious!  I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to sit back and forget the world for awhile, but I would suggest NOT showing it to children under 12 - as there is nudity, implied sexual content, and some pretty gory death scenes.",1392940800,,765,4.521739130434782

Anyway, it's a good movie, lots of action and shootem ups and fight scenes with agood dose of witch craft, the historical part how they grew up blended in well.",1392854400,,318,4.229508196721311

4771760,4,B005LAIH2M,I enjoyed the movie. Just a little shocked to see insulin being used in the movie of that period.  I guess you can always put a hidden meaning in anything.  Loved the actors and will watch it again.,1392854400,,198,4.184210526315789

Offering nothing productive as a true alternative to change than some bad-assed aggression.

4771858,1,B005LAIH2M,"I had my doubts when the opening credits noted that MTV had something to do with this movie. Story line could have been great, but they threw 21st century attitudes into the middle ages, kind of steam punk without the steam. The actors didn't act as much as posed, the dialogue was supposed to be witty but came off as smart aleck. The fight scenes were repetitious. Found Hansel and Gretel to be such annoying people that I had no sympathy for them nor their cause. The opening segment with H&G as children captured by a witch was great, but to me the film lost me as soon as they grew up with their lack of connection to anything medieval. More like MTV generation time travel back to Grimms fairy tale.",1392854400,2,705,4.3893129770992365

Just sit back and enjoy a new spin on an old story, complete with some outstanding special effects, plenty of dark humor, lots of gratuitous violence (mostly against witches), and with just a hint of sex. Sorry, can't recommend this fairy tale for the little ones, but the adults will find it entertaining. Would definitely watch a sequel.",1392854400,,461,4.634146341463414

4771963,2,B005LAIH2M,"When I first saw the previews for Hansel and Gretel I was anxious to see it as it was an old childhood fable. I brought that to the movie (yes, ignoring the R rating) and was highly disappointed. The action was good, but I have to admit rather graphic in spots, but that isn't what turned me off. The use of the f-bombs was unexpected, especially for that time-era. Call me old fashioned, but the use of f-bombs added nothing to the movie, in fact, for me, it took away the entertainment value of the movie, not to mention just totally out of sync with the time era (I know, I wasn't alive during that time era and I'm sure there was some swear words going on, but never read any f-bombs in literature coming out of the time era)...just one person's opinion.",1392768000,,758,4.3076923076923075

I studied Grimm fairy tales in college and had that stigma upon me as well.  Witches are supposed to be cunning and work their evil ways in mysterious fashion, not blast a bunch of townspeople with lasers and weaponry.  C'mon man!  Now, I love Gemma Arterton? and some of the other cast was quality, but the various accents and dialogue was inconsistent with whatever age they were in.

4772053,3,B005LAIH2M,It's pretty standard witch movie. They borrowed a couple weapons from Van Helsing. Hansel has some kind of diabetes I guess from his childhood witch experience of being forced to eat candy. That was different but he only seemed to need a couple of insulin injections the whole movie even though he said he needed one every couple hours.,1392681600,,336,4.711864406779661

I would actually watch this again if I was flipping through channels and saw it was on.  It's got some action, cheesy monsters that look creepy, and some good lines.

It's a different take on Hansel & Gretel and it was quite enjoyable.  I like a decent fairytale spin-off (ABC's Once series, NBC's Grimm, and the like) and it definitely keeps things interesting.",1392681600,,508,4.6

4772634,4,B005LAIH2M,"Fun, gory action type fairy-tale with attitude. Unreal weapons, but this IS a fairy tale, right? And they're used against unreal horros, so it's just, I guess, a ""Funtasy"" movie.",1392249600,,178,4.966666666666667
4772635,5,B005LAIH2M,"If you aren't among those who can suspend reality for the sake of fun for awhile, then you may want to take a pass.  BUT if you enjoy popping into a tale well told of creatures and things that operate in the deep, dark forests then you're probably Hansel & Gretel material. I am certainly one of the latter, and I had a rip-roaring good time watching this brother and sister team take on more weird witches than I've ever seen in one movie.  The action starts fast and doesn't really slow down until the end credits start to roll!  Of course it's stuffed with special effects which are very, very good, but it also has a great cast who all just seemed to blend into the story, they were believable and there was chemistry.  Naturally there are some good laughs, interesting weaponry, exploding body parts and a brief bare bottom.  I don't really need to go into detail or write 10 paragraphs concerning H&G.  Either you like fantasy, myth based movies or you don't.  I'm one of those who do and I'll be adding this one to my personal collection, which is really the highest recommendation I can think of.

4772684,4,B005LAIH2M,"I was multitasking, then fell asleep (due to having a full day), not because the movie was boring.  It took about three-four days to watch as I would watch during bed time.  I enjoyed how the movie had twists and turns.  Who would have thought that Hansel and Gretel would have grown up to be witch hunters?  Talk about turning adversity into triumph.

I also enjoyed the Shrek looking character, but at the end of the movie Gretel and the Shrek guy looked deeply at each other, I thought, ""this is just wrong,"" in a bestiality sort of way.  Maybe in a sequel something will develop between them.  It seems like that's where things were headed.  Anyways, the movie was entertaining, and some things caught me off guard even when I wasn't multitasking.

However, I was caught off guard when I saw Will Ferrel as the director. I like to get a feel of the numbers so I looked on Wikipedia.  According to Wikipedia this movie brought in over four times its cost, so a sequel is in order.  Usually ""they"" make sequels with these types of numbers.",1392163200,,1041,4.48404255319149

4772768,2,B005LAIH2M,"It seems as if this movie can't decide what it is. is it an adult take on Hansel and Gretel, complete with FBombs and violence, or is it a sub-teen movie, complete with Disney-like jokes and teen characters saying ""That was awesome!"".
The movie never makes up it's mind, leaving the viewer confused, caught between two worlds.
I can take, and even appreciate, some campiness in movies, but once agin, this movie can't decide whether to be campy and lighthearted, or serious and dark.  I think that both of these moods can be pulled off in a movie, but this one doesn't come close to making a smooth flow of that scenario.
I guess the thing that really annoys me is that the premise has so much promise, but instead of concentrating on good writing, and well, acting, it concentrates it's efforts on fighting special effects. And Shrek look-alikes.
Perhaps most of the good parts of this movie were left on the cutting-room floor, as an over-exuberant editor with a few too many bottles of cheap beer decided that leaving in anything intelligent would affront the American public.
Either way, it misses the mark, just as you should miss this movie.

A lot of action in the shooting, dismembering and head smashing scenes.  The weaponry they have at their disposal was unique and interesting. There was even a friendly Troll, Edward, who has a terrific part in stomping the bad guy's head like it was a melon with his size 26 shoe.
Acting was mediocre, story line was about as far fetched as non space-alien movies go...but I liked it.  Maybe it is just a guy thing, but I found humor, excitement and even a bit of closure (big grin on face here) as we finally find out WHY Hansel and Gretel's father left them in the forest in the first place.

NOT the good, oh, man that was awesome bad but the I can't believe people actually wrote the script, made a move of it and promoted it on top of me wasting an hour and a half sitting painfully through it hoping that it would get somehow better.

 I am not sure what kind of drugs anyone involved in this movie were doing but I hope they each went to rehab because they really needed help on the honesty with self phase on the reality of just how bad the end product really was.

For those reviewers comparing this to Van Helsing or Blade there is no closeness to which one was the worst. This movie is by far one of the worst I have ever seen. I actually like Van Helsing. Blade was ok. I would have given this one a One Star had turned it off without watching in the entirety though I was tempted on more than one occasion but I was so close to the end it almost felt like I would have been a quitter in not completing it.

The movie does take us through the rudiments of the original story at the beginning and then fast forwards to the adult Hansel and Gretel. From there it's a great deal of fun and action with some good acting and a couple of very slow spots. Could it be better? Probably.

Well I watched a few minutes of it, and it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been. A couple of days later I returned to watch the rest, and it was pretty good. If you like the Fox version of ""Sleepy Hollow"" you'll probably like this movie too. We're getting over run with supernatural cop shows on the networks. I don't know how many others there are, I only see the ads for them. One of that type is plenty. If I could pick up a Blu-Ray for around five bucks I'd grab it!",1391558400,,640,3.9307692307692306

The actors bring their A-game, and there's no small similarity between Famke Janssen's character in this and in ""Hemlock Grove.""  This movie weighs in at just the right length, remains entertaining throughout, and never wears out its welcome.

the weapons are futurist and the idea that hansel would know hes diabetic and needed insulin on a regular basis is laughable.
the wannnabe groupy guy who tries cleaning the dirt off Gretels chest is a good character.

I don't wish to spoil the movie in any way for someone else however in the opening credits the movie gives the impression of some kids defeating witch after witch.  Sometimes it is shown in the credits that they defeat multiple witches at the same time.  Therefore one can conclude by the time they grow up, they are seasoned, accomplished fighters with formidable skills.  Not even close to being the case, as the grown up versions shown in the movie are pathetic.

I hate to be 'juvenile' with expressions but... they ""suck"".  They get whipped quite handily in every encounter as adults.  And yet the script writers 'hand' victory to them for the sake of the title of the movie and a possible 'Hansel & Gretel 2....' .... coming to theater's soon...

You just can't it seriously after you know about the fairy tale.  Might also help the film if they would at least use dialogue more in tune with the time period this movie is supposed to be set in.  Not to mention, I realize they wouldn't use German for the movie but they could at least have taught the actors how to properly pronounce the various cities, towns, etc in proper German rather than like they're Americans acting as Germans.

4773898,5,B005LAIH2M,"Please, Jeremy Renner was enough for the movie to catch my interest...OMG!!! he is so cute and surprisingly funny, it was nice to watch him not being to serious. Hansel & Gretel had a believability in the way the brother and sister cared for one another. Lots of action, a good consistent story.",1391126400,,295,4.584905660377358

4773906,2,B005LAIH2M,If you are looking for some mindless witch killing it might be worth watching. Overall the story was weak and over the top. Watch the TV series Grimm instead.,1391126400,,158,4.482758620689655

4774003,3,B005LAIH2M,"Basically think of it as the old Wild Wild West television series. The basic story is interesting spin on the classic fairytale.

4774070,2,B005LAIH2M,"You shouldn't expect anything but a few groans and chuckles to come out of this one... the plot is relatively shallow, the action is cheesy, and you all know how it's going to end before it starts.

Also, definitely not for kids.",1391040000,,229,4.4523809523809526

4774074,4,B005LAIH2M,"I really liked the characters and the story line was OK, as well. I thought it was a little erratic and the back story was less than I would have liked but the co-stars were solid and the story kept my attention though I would liked to have seen more of the lives and the other characters, though maybe not a lot more. If there were to be a sequel I would deffinetly watch it, though it seems unlikely. But, like I say, I'm not a movie reviewer, just a fan of a good movie when I can watch one. I'm sure if you like action adventure movies you will be entertained, as I was. I just wish I was a little more eloquent, not to mention a better speller. Aside from that I hope this helps. Though since I didn't see it yesterday I cant always trust my memory so I guess I will go and watch it again. It is at least worth a second viewing. Enjoy:-)",1390953600,,842,3.9881656804733727

There's the bones of what they were trying to do, but it was executed rather poorly. There wasn't even much in the way of character development, just a bunch of random people thrown together and driven by one inane plot point after another.

It should stick to a single style or mode, it should be ""honest"" with itself (not attempt to be more than it is) and it should successfully deliver on it's setup (or be literal about how/why it doesn't). This movie does not hold to those basics and for me warranted shutting it off about a third of the way through. I'll admit I didn't stick around for delivering on the setup but when the setup doesn't hold your interest then there's nowhere to go but downward. My recommendation is, try it if you want to, but you'll never get that time back.",1390953600,,649,4.284552845528455

It's so stupid, the ""double"" crossbow is FULL AUTO... How? Did they even look at a crossbow before deciding that they can magically shoot full auto? How does it reload? How does it restring? The bows pivot and shoot sideways?!?!?! OMG , Did a child write this?

Why do they have Gatling gun in Midevil times? Is there a time machine we don't know about?  There's a local gun store that manufactures the shells for this gun?",1390953600,2,536,4.552083333333333

The movie will never be considered great or have lasting value but it was a nice diversion.  It was obvious from the beginning that the brother and sister had to have some magical background to have survived so many brushes with evil kind. Too bad the one good witch had to be terminated albeit after demonstrating great courage and dedication to good.  One can easily guess that despite her being found innocent of being a witch, that  in reality she was a good one.  (I hope that does not give too much of the story line away!)

4774781,3,B005LAIH2M,"Well, the title states the obvious. It's Hansel and Gretel. But they're all grown up and still killing witches.

There is nothing really all that realistic about the movie. But, that doesn't stop film from being enjoyable. Today, action is expected, and there is plenty of it here. Lots of witches getting what they deserve. It's worth a watch.

I'm giving the film 3 stars, ""It's Okay"". I have a hard time buying into any argument that this movie should get anywhere near 5 stars. I've read some of the other review. You'd think this movie was a classic, unjustly ignored by the Oscar nomination committee. I'm going to flat out state that to deserve a 5 star rating, it would have to be at least one of the 10 the best movies of the year. This probably isn't one of the 10 best movies during the month it was released.

So if you're looking for something to watch and it seems like you've seen everything, this isn't too bad. But if you're looking for an Action move that is worth 5 stars, I tend to think something like Raiders of the Lost Arc is where you'll get your best value.",1390694400,,1083,4.378109452736318

I did not expect a much from this movie, and I have no idea how it did at the ""Box Office"" But this was a fun movie !

Visually it is amazing - great costumes and special effects.  I really like the dialogue as well, grown up funny.  And then it has periods of sentimentality and suspense.

Finally I like what they have done with the story line....a new twist on the parents of Hansel and Gretel.

I never know why some action films are hits and others not.  And I do not worry much about that.

Hello! OMG, i'm no gun expert, but clearly some of the gun tech is from the earliest 1940s. Just so obviously out of place. And the sterotype of the White Witches? Ugh. She is so in love with the guy and will do anything for him and he could care less about her. The male lead has no emotional depth and is a cartoon character of a hero. The female lead is equally flat and bereft of complexity.

What saves the movie are the eye catching special effects. The creative design of the witches is intriguing. You want to see what the next witch looks like",1390608000,,727,4.268115942028985
4774859,3,B005LAIH2M,"Hansel and Gretel encompasses that Horror/Action sort of Van Helsing feel .  The special effects are cheap, but effective, the script is so cliche and cheesy that it's quite amusing, and the acting sits perfectly adjacent to both although the cast did include some interesting players.

Now I want to start by saying the obvious: the fact that the film lacks elements to qualify it as masterful or Oscar worthy shouldn't come as surprising, nor should it necessitate that the film is bad by nature, HOWEVER I think it's one of those features you really have experience for yourself before passing any judgment!  Luckily that's wholly possible within the first ten or fifteen minutes.  You really get a feel of the film's tone and quirks  from the get-go allowing you to determine if you'll continue through to the end.

I personally think the film would've earned more of an audience if it had been limited to  a PG-13 rating, but seeing as the thriller takes that Horror/Action genre, and isn't aiming for Academy Awards, I'm really quite pleased with the product the adult themes helped bring to the audience's table. For example, at one point a peasant explodes in a bar, blood and all, and Gretel exclaims ""I ******* hate that curse"" while a fan-boy of sorts sits there, covered in blood, and says ""awesome.""

I think it's easy to determine where the negatives to this sort of production inherently reside.  First, it's nothing unique.  Like I mentioned, it is pretty similar to Van Helsing in it's Action/Horror, 1600s feel, and laughable script merged with CGI which is okay at best.  Second, the film becomes predictable.  You won't really find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat, though you obviously don't know what specifically will transpire, but if you get the idea of where the story is going then you just might be more likely to be right than certain other films.  Third, you really won't take anything from this film.  It's fundamentally entertaining, but that's it.  Hope you weren't counting on Hansel and Gretel provoking some sort of epiphany.

So in conclusion, you should personally decide on whether it's your thing or not.  By general film terms, I'd give it about a 6/10.  I know people that have thoroughly enjoyed and absolutely hated H&G, so don't be dismayed if you fall under either opinion or in-between.  It's definitely a sort of cult classic.  I'd also add that while I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this, I'd give it a chance if you found it on Amazon, Netfliz, or at a friend's, etc.  It's really only a cure for one's boredom, and not a source, by any means, of inspiration.",1390521600,,2626,4.740088105726873

4774861,1,B005LAIH2M,"I made it through the first 15 minutes before turning it off. There was nothing new, unique or remotely entertaining about this version of a childhood fairytale.  I found myself becoming distracted by the thought that the version of Hansel and Gretel they did on the old Bugs Bunny show was way more entertaining.  Then I tried to recall all of the details of the Bugs Bunny version and decided at that point I might as well shut it down.",1390521600,2,438,4.4625

There was some gory moments,but just enough to make the story good and not gross. I think the only thing i didn't like is that someone who played a major part in the movie dies. I won' tel who, but I wish they didn't i loved their character, and it made it bitter sweet. I loved how it answered every question we had about the story growing up, and the fact the bad guys get theirs... Which is great!! The weapons are bad ass!!

I only found one line in the movie that did not seem fluid.  The female actress is sexy without being lewd and I like the male actors abilities in general.  Forgive me for not naming because I have a disability.  I had only heard very little about the movie now I am sorry I did not see it in a large screen theater.  Will probably purchase the DVD.

We decided to watch it with our 8-year-old son. After all, he's seen Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings... why would this be scarier or more gruesome? 5 minutes into the movie I was urging my husband to turn it off. OMG... it is so visually disturbing! Blood, bursting heads, soaring body parts... that's all I recall. That's about 80% of the movie. Not much of a plot, practically zero character development... just heads coming off and ugly witches with bad hair days.

It's a horror movie. There's not much more to it. I just wish I had known before I decided to watch it. I thought it was something along the lines of fantasy/action/adventure... nope.

Definitely not worth it. Not worth buying (I'm glad I didn't) and not worth spending 98 minutes watching it. Much to my dismay :(.",1390521600,,1017,4.516304347826087

WRONG! holy moly, for being the ""famed witch hunter"", she couldn't even fight off a mosquito if it were attacking her.  the writing was terrible for her character; but i thought Gemma did well in portraying a bad-ass chic....buuuut her character and the writing just lacked a lot.
-the only reason i'm giving this two stars is because of Famke Janssen, i've always been a fan of hers, and i thought she did really well as the witch... but again, the writing just fell into that well-known extremely-cliched character development for the witch character: writer 1: ""hey guys, i have a great idea on how to write the witch characters: let's make their skin look like chipped sandpaper and dried desert, and give them nasally voices..no one has ever seen that!"".

Pros:
Plot - Rich and tight storyline that actually could be plausible
Cast - Excellent job by the lead characters
Makeup - The witches are scary!
Humor - There are a lot of one liners to watch for that will leave you in stitches (or groans).

Cons:
Not recommended for the under 13 group.  This is still a scary story about witches and children.
Weapons -  A little far fetched but effective
Language:  Instead of using the ""f"" word, couldn't they have used something that fit the time of the story and meant the same thing?",1390176000,,606,4.280701754385965

This movie won't get an oscar for sure, but it will most likely entertain enough that after you see it, you won't feel cheated for your time and money, In my case I don't feel like I wasted my time watching since I get to see it for free, because I'm a prime user.
Don't let the bad review persuade you into not watching this movie, it's perfect for movie night.  If you want a movie that will make you reflect and think about life then don't watch this movie.  It is a action/fantasy/horror with some comedy type of movie, so don't come expecting more then that.  I always wonder why people give bad reviews to movie when they have seen the trailers and they still complaint that the movie had poor acting, story was basic and so on, I can only blame them for expecting something this movie which is not.",1390176000,,1017,4.286458333333333

There's not much in the way of cerebral stimulation in this film, but let's face it - if anyone expects intellectualism from this film, then they've missed reading the entire title of the movie. This is supposed to be just for a mindless entertainment session and nothing more. It's simply fun to watch, so don't try to read anything into it and you'll enjoy the movie.

Warning: Don't watch this with the kiddies! Too much gore and will be something any child under the age of 12 will have nightmares from!

If you're a Prime Member, then watch it. If you're into the type of movies that cater to this kind of fantasy-laden fun, then watch it (without children around).

Would I buy it? No, but only because I would only watch it once and then move on. It's that kind of film; still, it's a great way to kill a couple of hours and get lost in a mythical realm of witches, a new twist on an old tale, and a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon.",1390089600,,1224,4.240343347639485

There's quite a lot of gore...so it is almost a horror movie...but lacked the ""scary"" nature of a horror movie.  Honestly, if they would have tried to go horror instead of action & adventure it would have been a really nice horror movie.  Today's horror movie have gone demonic and are far too uncomfortable to watch.  It would have been nice to have an ""old style"" horror movie out of this one.

4776766,1,B005LAIH2M,"I would have loved to have been on the committee that threw this movie together. I like to think the conversation may have gone a little like this:
""Hey guys! Let's do another hard-boiled reboot of a fairy tale because Red Riding Hood was just such an unqualified success.""
""Sounds good! How about Hansel and Gretel? That is a story that exists.""
""Great, we'll give them guns and make them say a lot of swears. Let's ditch the candy house, that's silly.""
""No, keep it! That's what makes it Hansel and Gretel!""
""Okay, but it needs to be hard-boiled and also gritty I know EATING THE CANDY GIVES HANSEL DIABETES!""

And so begins Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, that sees the eponymous victims of child neglect roast their sorcorous captor and set out on a career of hunting other witches. This naturally entails that they wear lots of black leather and have heaps of guns that didn't exist during the time period in which the movie is set. It also helps that the two are immune to harmful witchcraft, and that evil witches are all ugly. Like, it's mandatory. There are good witches, who are all pretty, of course. Incidentally, PRETENDING to be hot is the MOST ADVANCED skill an evil witch can learn. So there you have it, ugliness literally equates to evil, and all ugly women aspire to be pretty most of all. I think the only thing keeping feminists from picketing this movie is that nobody went anyway, probably including the people who would object to it.

Anyhow, Hansel and Gretel arrive in some German town where everyone speaks with English or American accents because who cares, and they promptly interrupt a witch burning because the witch isn't ugly enough. It is revealed that they have been hired to thwart a plague of witches who are abducting the town's children. The pretty-girl-burning sheriff doesn't like this and tries to stop them repeatedly, because the only movies to ever contain good sheriffs were Dead Bang and Walking Tall.

Hansel and Gretel head out and mess around in the woods until the movie remembers that it is an American action film. Gretel gets captured because she is a woman, and the evil Grand Witch reveals that Gretel is in fact a white witch, which she inherited from her mother because ""Witch"" is an ethnic group. Hansel and the hot witch he saved earlier set out to rescue her before her heart can be used to make the ugly witches fireproof, which turns out to be easy because they have tons and tons of guns and witches are basically just old women with pointy sticks unless the writers say different.

Ignoring the staggering misogyny (and grotesque stereotyping of witches, I guess) on display here, the movie is still pretty terrible. The CG is all awful and plastic-y, the script sounds to be about two pages long (and one page's worth is just the f word and ""witch""), and every ounce of action that might redeem things is ruined by the existence of THREE! DEE! and the resultant need to hurl debris, blood, body parts, whole bodies, bullets, Famke Jamison, and the audience's dignity straight at the viewer. This was irritating when Jaws 3D did it, and if I'm being honest, this movie has even less going for it than that one did.

Verdict: If you want to watch a Jeremy Renner movie watch Avengers, and if you want to watch a Gemma Arterton movie, don't.

PROS:
None. I have nothing nice to say about this movie.

CONS:
Everything about this movie is offensive to the sensibilities. There is no angle from which to critique this movie from which it will not be found wanting.

NOTES:
-This is the unrated extended cut, meaning you will see a scene where dudes try to rape Gretel, then a scene where Hansel has some sex. Basically the same added content as in Terminator Salvation then.
-This movie may have a sequel soon as it sold well in Europe. SHAME ON YOU, EUROPE, HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?",1389916800,7,3842,4.62316715542522

One of the really great things about this movie is about the characters, be they witches, trolls or hunters, and all the in camera make-up (NOT CG) that was used to effectively portray them.

A lot of action movies just focus on big fight, chases, explosion.  H+G had the action, but it also spent a little time on the characters and the world.  Sure it had its share of problems, but for an action flick it is pretty great.

The style of the movie was also pretty interesting.  It didn't feel CG slick.  It had a bit of an old school vibe to the makeup and FX, which fit really well with the fairy tale/fantasy world building.

4777689,3,B005LAIH2M,"Mini-Review: Last night we watched 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'. It this time it's available free to Amazon Prime members. I found it to be a fun movie for the most part. It reminded me very much of the '2004' film 'Van Helsing'. If you liked that, you might like this also. They had the same sort of fantastic weapons as Van Helsing did, seemingly impossible for the time periods depicted. There were more witches in this movie than you can shake a broomstick at . Most were appropriately scary or weird looking. The acting was good and there was plenty of action. There was some gore, not too excessive, enough to earn its R-rating I suppose. Occasionally the language seemed a bit out of place, just like the weapons were, for the time. For instance when under-stress our two heroes liked to use the F word. No big deal, just that it somehow seemed out of place, and too contemporary for the surrounding mood. The ending left the door open for a sequel or two if it was a success at the box-office. I did like the friendship that developed between Gretel and an unlikely character in the story. There was also a love story with Hansel. Both side stories added some ""charm"". I don't want to say more and reveal too much. I'd give this one a 2 /12 or 3 out of 5 stars.",1389744000,3,1273,4.375527426160337

4777691,4,B005LAIH2M,"To enjoy this movie you have to be a fan of the so bad it's good oeuvre. This film typifies all that is good about that genre.

The plot is paper thin but frankly if you watched this film expecting a compelling story you have no one to blame but yourself. This is a strictly turn off brain suspend belief sort of movie and as long as you approach it with the right spirit it's rip roaring fun.

This film presents a fun twist on a classic fairy tale. Gone are the boring child Hansel & Gretal (in my mind always dressed in Leiderhosen) and instead we have a kick ass Gemma Arterton and a grumpy yet loveable as always Jeremy Rennet hamming it up in some steam punk gear, merrily taking out witches with appropriately OTT levels of gore.

The action scenes are great fun and while you feel Jeremy Renner is there under duress he still throws himself into it, and has good chemistry with Gemma Arterton. Ms Arterton is as always wonderful and holds her own against the scenery chewing Famke Janssen, who to steal a quote from a newspaper film critic, didn't so much phone it in as send it in by carrier pigeon.

The story whizzes through the obligatory action scenes tied together with the finest strands of plot to a satisfyingly obvious climax. That's not to say serious issues aren't touched on: as in the classic tale during their initial capture by an evil witch Hansel is forced to eat copius levels of candy. The fairy tale version glosses over this but kudos to the writers here to showing the consequences. Poor adult Hansel had the 'sugar sickness' which rears its head during suitably dramatic moments. I say shame on the Brothers Grimm for not considering this issue.

All in all this movie was great fun and I genuinely recommend it. Just make sure you watch if with the right attitude!",1389744000,,1797,4.483180428134556

The fun just doesn't slow down and 90 minutes just vanish.  Very good sets and effects.  Will Ferrell's influence was definitely present in this film.

4777808,4,B005LAIH2M,"Was it deep?  No.  Was the ""plot twist"" that much of a surprise?  Not really.  Big character development?  Nah.  Was it fun to watch if you're not in the mood to take something too seriously?  Absolutely.  This movie had just a little bit of everything, but still kept it in the action genre.  The comedy wasn't enough to make it cheesy, the love interest wasn't going to make it sappy.  The blood and guts was enough to say ""ooohhhh"" but not graphic enough to make you think it was real even for a second.  (Was that a head getting crushed, or a bucket full of ripe tomatoes?)  And yes, the one scene with gratuitous nudity was just enough to catch your eye, but not enough to make you uncomfortable.

Sit back, grab a bowl of popcorn, and take it for what it is.......just plain fun.",1389744000,,785,4.3310344827586205
4777809,3,B005LAIH2M,"Interesting take on an old fairy tale. The movie title would suggest family fare, but violence and language would not make for a family movie.  Okay for adult viewing, but wouldn't watch it with the kiddies.",1389744000,,207,4.75

4777926,4,B005LAIH2M,"Thrilling movie. It stayed close to what I remember of the fairy tale as a child and yet modernized the tale in unexpected ways. I gave it 4 stars because I think they should have made ""good"" witches outlast the bad ones. In this tale, white magic was almost powerless against black magic.",1389657600,,289,4.471698113207547

Don't get me wrong, it's all good, but there is little historical accurateness to any of the clothing, mechanism's or other props used making the movie less than believable, or more of a teenager piece.  Kind of like the movie ""A Knight's Tale"" where everyone in the movie starts singing ""we will rock you"" by Queen.  The movie is good, and I personally enjoyed it, but I also can appreciate science fiction that is historically more accurate.  Van Helsing was probably better at keeping the movie more ""realistic"".

Overall I felt like the story was meant for young teenagers who still think saying the F word is cool because it's a bad word.

The idea of a grown up version of a fairy tail isn't a bad one, but when the story is hobbled together with flat one liners it's never a good idea. The movie has the heroes using the F-word and using weapons right out of a bad version of the Matrix Redemption, but the heroes are flat and run around like versions of what a 12 year old would seem cool, to bad the movie isn't for 12 year olds. The Witches are over the top with all the clich&eacute;s of bad witches. They cock their heads to the side and evil laugh all the time, just in case the bad CGI on their faces didn't tip you off that they were bad. Unfortunately the movie isn't even bad enough to be a cult classic.

4779139,5,B005LAIH2M,"First thing to note is this: I am not rating the movie based on its overall quality as a movie. I am rating this movie based on how much I enjoyed it, especially considering how hammy and ridiculous it was. Most movies like this I don't enjoy at all, but I loved and had fun with this one.

SPOILERS FOLLOW

First of all, the story hooked me from the beginning. Maybe I'm on a weird ""Hit Girl"" fixation from the Kick Ass movies, but when young Gretel stabbed that witch repeatedly, that's when I knew this movie would be a blast. The story kept me entertained and interested throughout the entire film. Then, we have the adult Hansel and Gretel, played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton. You can easily see how ridiculous Renner finds the whole thing, but his performance is still fun and enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, it's Arterton (both her character and performance) that steals the show. My favorite scene with her is when she bites the evil town sheriff's nose (after breaking it by headbutting him earlier in the film), and then she spits a chunk of it out, her face covered in blood. Let's not mention all the random F-bombs that Hansel and Gretel (mainly Gretel) throw around. I'm not a fan of much profanity in films usually, but I have to admit that the F-bombs are part of the treat here (since I don't really consider this a ""film"" but a ""movie"").

As for the witches, they had to be some of the silliest, least scary, most over-the-top witches in cinematic history...and I loved them for it. There were many moments where I was outright guffawing at the goofiness. On a quick note, I applaud the use of actual prosthetics instead of CGI for the witches; they actually all looked pretty awesome. As far as the silliness, we have these witches, all with superhuman strength in addition to their magic, running around jumping over things, punching, kicking, riding brooms backwards, using magic to make humans kill people, etc. All the while, they look and act like the Orcs from Lord of the Rings; in other words, there's lot of screaming, growling, and head wagging.

My favorite performance of all is from the beautiful Famke Janssen as the grand witch Muriel. While I love her for her role as Jean in X-Men, it was seeing her as Xenia Onatopp, the sexually-crazed villain from Goldeneye, that made me love her as an actress. I think she excels at playing villains, and here is no exception. In a way, this role is quite similar to her Goldeneye role. It's extremely over-the-top, she kills a lot of people brutally, and she just completely embraces the ridiculousness of it all and makes it great and memorable. Plus, I admire someone as beautiful as her being willing to appear under ugly witch makeup for most of the movie, although part of me found the witch rather sexy knowing it was Famke.

NOTES ABOUT EXTENDED CUT
I haven't watched it in full, but I've seen different scenes, and from what I can tell, the extended version is the way to go if you want more over-the-topness. One of the standout new moments is when Muriel (as a watch), bashes a guys skull and pulls out his brain, then throwing it on the ground with an Orc-like head wag. There are many other scenes and changes that make the extended version actually worth it.

Keep in mind, I'm not an advocate of brutal violent in real life. But the silly, campy violence of this movie is just so fun to watch. On a guilty pleasure scale, this movie gets 5 out of 5 stars from me.",1389225600,,3463,4.523961661341853

4779285,3,B005LAIH2M,"This is an absurd movie, but the CGI looks good, it centers around a fun idea, doesn't take itself too seriously, and -- Hey, who doesn't like a beautiful woman given to headbutting evil sheriffs on a whim?

Hansel and Gretel never got over their grudge against the witch who tried to eat them, and are such poor sports about it they take up witch-hunting as a career.  How they get their machine guns and cartridges, multi-shot three-direction crossbows, and anachronistic leather jackets, and the medical knowledge to fight diabetes, in the age of castles and kings, we'll never know, but it's all shot and thought just well enough that you'd feel like a nit for caring.  More important is that the actresses are gorgeous and that the true fun in the movie is mostly Famke Janssen's.  She struts about, sneers in her ugly-make-up, and explodes peasants into hamburger with relish, and plenty of ketchup, with satisfying regularity and wonderful flair.  She's really pretty darn scary.

Along the way we meet a troll (good make-up!) with a heart of gold, perhaps the world's most beautiful red-haired witch, and a would-be apprentice, an evil sheriff, and a non-entity of a mayor who are all given varying degrees of short shrift in the story.  The heroes undergo the usual spiritual transformation now necessary in every type of movie from disease-of-the-week to battling-giant-robots-vs-Godzilla, as usual so slight and mechanical it's little more than a perfunctory nod and of no interest whatever.  Take off your thinking caps for this one, enjoy the wonderful Famke Janssen leering through her creepy make-up, the completely inappropriate but oh-so-satisfying weaponry, the beautiful people and the whole goofy, unnecessary, time-wasting fun of it.

More fun than a 3-star but except as the silliest sort of fun, this isn't really 4-star material.  But at least it's no Van Helsing.  3.5 seems fair, but a 3.5 to try out instead of put at the very bottom of the pile.",1389139200,,1973,4.984756097560975

4779370,4,B005LAIH2M,"HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is one of those rare action/horror films utterly without pretension.  It's pure schlock entertainment with a strong sense of humor, a high (and gory) body count, and great actors hamming it up and having an utter ball.

The story follows that brother/sister duo from Brothers Grimm fame.  They've grown up to become witch hunters, due to a mysterious past they're still figuring out.  They stumble into a ramshackle village plagued by a rash of child disappearances.  Turns out, everything's being orchestrated by a master witch with a devious agenda, and Hansel & Gretel may fit perfectly into her plan...

Okay, so it's ludicrous.  But that's part of the fun.  No one's taking anything seriously here, except maybe Jeremy Renner (it's almost as though he can't quite sink down to the appropriate level).  Gemma Arterton is delightfully deadpan; she knows exactly the kind of film she's making and loves it.  Same with Famke Janssen, who brings an appropriate amount of campy menace to her villainous role.  The effects are actually quite good; there's a lot of gore, which usually I'm against, but here it provides the perfect amount of B-grade aura.  And that's what HANSEL & GRETEL is: a big budget B-movie.  Sound like you're kind of thing?  You the kind of person who occasionally just wants to have a little R-rated fun?

I gave it 5 stars because the movie was just plain FUN! It had Jeremy Renner who is fantastic, it always aimed to lighten the mood with a bit a comedy in-between the lines, and, they did a fantastic job on the witches! The witches were done so well!

I don't know if it works in spite of or because of the anachronistic absurdities they threw in.  I love them, myself.  It's over-the-top, pure fun.  There's violence and gore but they're hard to take seriously and if you're squeamish, you'll have a pretty good idea of when to look away.  It wasn't disturbing because it never quite felt real.

The main character in this story really is Gretel.  She's truly the brains of the operation.  It centers around her, for reasons I can't say without spoiling it.  It passes the Bechdel test, if you're curious.  There's a point where she's attacked and a lesser movie would have made it into a potential rape situation, but I appreciate that she's not treated that way here.  I know that triggers are very important to some people, and other than the violence throughout the movie, I didn't notice anything triggering. (Disclaimer: I can't say there aren't any other triggers, but I didn't notice any glaringly obvious ones.)

It's got some great one-liners.  A couple of aspects of it remind me of Buffy.  I'm really glad to hear they're working on a sequel.

4779566,3,B005LAIH2M,"Leather. Gore. Anachronistic steampunk weapons. Snarling witches. And a pair of classic fairy-tale characters who have become witch-hunting bounty hunters.

If that doesn't tip you off that this isn't a very serious movie, then maybe the title will: ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters."" Tommy Wirkola's first big Hollywood movie is strictly the kind of action-packed popcorn-for-the-brain that is fun to watch, as long as you don't take it too seriously. The biggest problem is that the movie never quite figures out if it's a tongue-in-cheek action movie or a dark comedy.

Once upon a time, Hansel and Gretel were abandoned in the woods by their parents, and ended up wandering over to a house made of candy. You know how the story goes -- there's a witch inside, she wants to eat Hansel, Gretel saves the day, and the witch is burned alive.

Happily ever after? Well, not exactly. Fifteen years later, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are leather-clad weapon-toting bounty hunters who specialize in witches, especially since spells don't affect them. The mayor of a small town hires them when children go missing, despite the meddling of the psychotic local sheriff and his band of goons.

After catching and offing a local witch, Hansel and Gretel discover that the witches are planning a massive sacrifice during a forthcoming Blood Moon. Even worse, the witches are led by a Grand Witch named Muriel (Famke Jansson) who knows the secrets of the siblings' past, and the true reason their parents abandoned them. Defeating her and her followers might be more than even Hansel and Gretel can handle.

My biggest problem with ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is that it never quite makes up its mind what it wants to be -- it's too serious to be a dark comedy, but still too tongue-in-cheek to be a straight action movie. It vacillates between the two extremes constantly. But either way, it's a fun brainless movie, with buckets of gore and anachronistic weapons (Hansel's love-interest Mina blasts witches with a FRICKING GATLING GUN!).

So if you expect a mindless, tongue-in-cheek gorefest, this movie will probably fit the bill. Is it a great movie? Not really. Is it fun? Yeah! It's not even trying to be ""authentic,"" so it succeeds wildly.

Wirkola is pretty obviously reveling in the ability to create a ""dark fairy tale"" with a firm R-rating. It could have used some subplot-pruning (Thomas Mann's ""fanboy"" character is just distracting), but the central tale is a pretty straightforward one. The fun comes from the one-liners (""I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket""), the B-movie stunts and sets, and the gore. Did I mention the gore? Because there's a lot of it, and it's fun.

Wirkola also seems to enjoy showing Renner and Arterton getting beaten up, because nearly every scene with ANY action involves them getting slammed into rocks, knocked senseless, and occasionally stabbed. The Grimm siblings certainly earn their money.

Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton honestly couldn't look any LESS like siblings, but both look like they're having a blast as leather-clad, cussing bounty hunters who constantly wave around absurd weapons (Hansel's hilariously phallic gun). They are perfectly suited to the dry, tongue-in-cheek approach of the script, and they even get some interesting character twists, such as Hansel suffering from diabetes because of his all-candy diet as a child.

""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is by no means a great film, but it is a resolutely fun one -- lots of splattered body parts, screeching witches and gleeful anachronisms. Turn off your brain and enjoy.",1388016000,19,3651,5.029801324503311

There are some gross scenes, but not many. The story was actually very good but they didn't put it to good use and the movie plods in some places and just speeds along for no reason in others. Being a big Jeremy Renner fan, I was hoping this would have been better. The chemistry between Renner and his love interest was non existent, while the chemistry between him and the actress who played his sister was much better. The one completely gratuitous love scene was really bad and blissfully short. The actress who played Gretel, who was also the princess in the Prince of Persia, was the one good thing about this movie. I would like to see her in more American movies, as she is a very good actress. I think Renner just wanted some extra cash to renovate another house which is why he said yes to this movie.

4779874,1,B005LAIH2M,"I really am sorry to have spent money on this thing.  This is the most misogynistic, chauvinistic, woman-hating movie I have ever heard of.  The ""action"" consists of the ""good guys"" gruesomely killing women.  It truly made me sick.  The writers clearly despise women in general and strong women in particular.

I would like it so much more if they did a couple of scenes where a bunch of witches butchered members of the Hollywood writers union in particularly disgusting and horrible ways.",1384992000,,490,4.855421686746988

4779939,3,B005LAIH2M,"The preview contained most of the good parts.  The two main actors seemed bored with their roles and most of their lines seemed to lack any emotion.  Also, I am a bit confused.  Hansel and Gretel are suppose to be these great and feared witch hunters; yet they seem to get their behinds handed to them in the majority of their battles.  The battles were even a bit lackluster even though the director seemed to like the ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" style of fighting.  The two main characters had quite the potty mouth which seemed odd since it did not enhance the moment nor did it make them seem tougher.  The profanity used by them seemed out of place and odd.  The witches were a bit odd with the white face make up and black lines making them look like a cracked egg. Some of the weapons were slick while others looked plastic and unimpressive.  The whole movie seemed a bit off.  It wasn't good but it wasn't horrible, it just lacked a lot.",1384646400,,949,4.408045977011494

It's no huge classic but it is a fun, inventive film - and Jeremy Renner is just a hoot and handsome in whatever film he is in.  Famke Jansen is also a real scream as the witch and while this movie isn't high art it definitely is fun for a rainy afternoon and the special effects are quite good and don't totally reek of CGI like so many films these days.",1384560000,,521,4.038834951456311

4779989,1,B005LAIH2M,"I knew his wasn't going to be a great movie, but it was much worse than I thought. I expected Hansel & Gretel to be an actioner comparable to Van Helsing or Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, but those look like masterpieces (they aren't) next to this stinker. This really isn't the showcase for Jeremy Renner which I'm sure he'd hoped it would be. The story starts like the classic fairy tale, but after they escape, Hansel and Gretel begin a career stalking and killing witches. There's a central story thread about trying to learn the true fate of their parents, who dissappeared the night they where rushed from their home by their father and ended up wandering into the witch's candy house. The whole thing is rather convoluted and not very memorable. Much of the time in the action scenes, it's much too dark to see what is going on. They didn't even try to establish accents for these supposedly European characters or make any effort to forgo modern attitudes for the leads. There's a character who is not what she appears to be, but I guessed her secret very quickly.  And somebody must have thought they were being terribly clever by casting Famke Janson, who is a very beautiful woman, as the lead witch. Fortunately, you do get to see her without the witch makeup part of the time. I've already wasted way too much of my life on this film, so I'll wrap this up by advising you to skip it.",1384214400,4,1393,4.5059288537549405

4780414,3,B005LAIH2M,"This film recalls to me a recurring sketch on the old ""Saturday Night Live"" called ""What If?"".  It shouldn't be surprising that two of the film's producers are Will Ferrell and his longtime collaborator Adam McKay.  This film is an uneasy marriage of tongue-in-cheek humor and gory violent action.  That said the humor does make some of the more stomach churning effects palatable.  I did giggle at some of the gags notably the hand drawn pictures of missing children glued to clear glass milk bottles or the kid offering Gretel a bowl of porridge.  It's also pretty amusing making Hansel a diabetic.  The film is intermittently clever but wears out its welcome even at an economical eighty-seven minute running time.  This isn't a bad film but an eminently forgettable one.",1380844800,,774,4.907692307692308

4780487,2,B005LAIH2M,"Updating fairy tales has been a popular past-time for decades. At first, Disney would give its spin to the classics, mostly by providing happier or more upbeat endings to the tales. Recently, some updates have been more like reversals, making the villains not just sympathetic but even the heroes of the stories. Others have moved the tales to different times and places, often contemporary times and places.

Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters start with a faithful if over-the-top retelling of their story of abandoning by their father, discovering the candy house, and killing the witch who was planning to eat them. The feat put them on a career path that takes up most of the movie, killing witches and other nefarious beings professionally. It also sets the tone for the movie. The witch is fairly gruesome and her death in the oven is a bit much. The scene ends with a swear-filled voice-over by Hansel about what they learned from the experience.

So there's a lot of swearing and gore and nasty creatures but it's not particularly scary, definitely not a horror film. It doesn't have enough laughs in it to make it a good comedy. Hansel and Gretel are a bit too brutal and a bit too grim to be fun action heroes. The dialogue sounds like contemporary urban characters but the setting is grungy small-town middle ages and the two never quite fit together. The same goes with their high-tech fighting gear and semi-martial arts combat moves--sure they look cool except they don't quite match the other elements. The film makers seem to have had a lot of different ideas of ways to go with the movie and then put them all in without any thought of how to blend them.

The movie is very uneven and unsatisfying.",1380758400,,1714,4.706666666666667

As for it not being fit for children-read the actual story of Hansel and Gretel along with the other stories of the time-all were pretty gory and dark just like life was in the same time frame.

4780610,1,B005LAIH2M,"This movie sucked big time.  Sorry, that's not very literary writing for a movie review, but it is the truth.  I thought this movie would take itself a little more seriously...even Jack the Giant Slayer is more watchable than this - ditto any of the recent Snow White movies, or the Red Riding Hood movie.  But this?  It's nothing more than a violent video game with cheesy action hero one-liners tossed in!

Okay, calm down. First of all, the plot:  Hansel and Gretel have a bad ""witch experience"" as children (as we all know, it's how the story goes...)so during their adult lives, they decide to embark on revenge on all witches.  Basically, that's it.  There's a tiny bit more, but I won't be a spoiler - not that it matters anyway, since you should not go anywhere near this movie to begin with!

There is basically ZERO character development in this version of the story - there is no interesting back story involving any of the witches - just 2 leather clad cool hip vigilante witch hunters who swear an awful lot for mideival times, along with toting huge assault rifles - not very interesting weaponry for a supposedly magical era, right?

This movie is such a bad clich&eacute;!  The funny thing is, I don't believe it was supposed to actually be a spoof!  There is even the sexy ""good witch"" thrown in for the guys to drool over, along with the requisite view of her naked (oh please!  All women are groaning inwardly over this part).

Violence and objectification of women, anyone?  If that's your cup of tea.  Lots of innocent women were burned at the stake during the infamous witch hunts....oh forget it. I guess nobody cares about that.  How uncool of me to bring it up!

This movie is mostly blood and violence for the sake of showing blood and violence (think ""D'Jango, with witches"").  Some people say the visuals are great.  Well, I guess they are...unfortunately, good visuals don't make up for weak uninspired writing.

No matter what you do, Do NOT let your children see this movie!!!  It just may scar them for life.  What happened to making just a nice interesting movie where you actually get to know the main characters, and maybe even (gasp!) like them?  These 2 main characters are not likable at all.  They are only 2-dimensional cartoon characters who you could care less about.

I guess I have expressed myself enough here.  I do NOT recommend this movie - not even for a PPV...not even if someone hands it to you for free - or pays YOU to watch it.  Walk...no RUN in the opposite direction!",1379808000,5,2523,4.583892617449664

The weapons were beyond reality for the time period with the possible exception of the string of wire laced around the trees which took out a couple of witches who didn't have enough screen time.  The reveal that Gretel's mom was a white witch didn't explain why Gretel was in danger if she wasn't a practicing witch of a high order - which was the whole point of the twelve kidnappings to begin with.

PRO: I suppose it was a bit of fun. If you don't expect too much out of a movie -- like a thrilling plot, or an excellent script, or superb acting -- then you can watch this and be moderately entertained.

CON: The plot was paper thin, the script was mostly dull (and occasionally downright stupid), and the acting was only half-hearted and mediocre at best.",1379203200,,756,4.424460431654676

4780939,5,B005LAIH2M,"Even though this didn't get very good reviews when it was first out in the theaters, I thought it was a good movie.  A LOT of action, which I like.  It kept my interest, which not all movies do.  If I don't fall asleep during a movie, I know it was good. :-)",1378771200,,258,3.830188679245283
4780940,2,B005LAIH2M,"This item was labeled 'UNRATED' in the description. So, I'm guessing most people would think that all three videos came that way. WRONG!!! Only the BluRay Video is unrated. The DVD and the 3D DVD are both the theatrical versions (which cuts out quite a bit of the movie, btw).",1378684800,2,276,4.54

4780988,3,B005LAIH2M,"I don't suppose anyone rents this thinking it will be a blockbuster action movie. It is simple fun. Think Hansel and Gretel at a Steampunk Ren Faire.

His sister was very good in Clash of the Titans.  Maybe I set my bar high thinking that these two actors would be great,  only to find that the story left a lot to be desired.  The special effect were great. So all in all I can only say this was a good movie,  just not great.",1378425600,,424,3.8160919540229883

4781133,3,B005LAIH2M,"Not bad, but not good.  It's cheesy and campy, while trying to pass as anything but. It can get pretty graphic in some parts, but never over the top disgusting graphic.  The plot line is thin, and easy to guess, but still amusing.  It treads the wire between Good and Bad, while never fully tipping over to one side or the other.",1378252800,,329,4.274193548387097

4781219,1,B005LAIH2M,"There are some neat ""steampunk"" gadgets and I really like the actors involved in this movie, but ultimately it has a very weak story line and I'm sorry I paid to rent it. It's quite gory; it's for effect and sometimes works but most often is just pretty gross and unneeded. Jeremy Renner is too understated to make this any fun like ""The Brothers Grimm,"" which was a similar style of movie but worked so well because of the personalities of the main actors. If you have other movies on your list, see them first!",1378166400,2,512,4.4

4781225,4,B005LAIH2M,"Fairly tale stuff with modern Gatling Gun action. I especially liked how the gorgeous woman could turn at a moments notice into the ##$%# busting witch (sound familiar).

Good family entertainment (despite the R rating which I kept waiting for the shocking scene - if not the bum shot of the redheaded ""white"" which, this move would likely have been rated PG13).

The troll (Edward) is delightful .... ""you want to fight me friend? ... well here's me friend, fight him"" ... I wish I had him as my friend! LOL",1378080000,,508,4.571428571428571
4781226,2,B005LAIH2M,"Exactly which audience was this film going for-Teens and Adults (as the R Rating, language and violence would suggest) or Children? (as the over the top hammy dialog and its ridiculous hyperbolic delivery would have you believe)

The premise of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was rife with potential and bad a**ery.  Unfortunately the campy acting and overly exaggerated villain-speak made me feel like I was watching a silly little cartoon instead.  Eye rolling and palms to the forehead aside-it was disappointing that the witches could manage to exaggerate every single line of dialog, yet Hansel couldn't even manage to fire his gun for the first forty minutes.  Sadly this film didn't even get remotely interesting until the last twenty-FINALLY making good on its promising premise.  By then it was too late though.  They even set things up pretty good for a sequel but given H&G's poor reception I doubt it will happen.  I'm convinced a sequel would've been a better film given that the original (hopefully) got all the crap out of the way.

It's disappointing to see Hollywood squander yet another promising premise. I couldn't tell if this film took itself way too seriously or not seriously enough.  I was prompted to watch ""Army of Darkness"" immediately following because for the entire duration of H&G I kept imagining the witches boasting ""I'll swallow your soul"" then Ash popping up on screen to shove the siblings aside and blow the witches arrogant little heads off.  If you're gonna fight cocky supernatural baddies that's how you get the job done.  Talk just doesn't cut it.  :)",1378080000,,1597,4.962406015037594

4781289,2,B005LAIH2M,"I'll admit it... I love bad action movies.  For example, I love most anything with Jason Statham in it.  I also love Jeremy Renner.  Even when he played the easy to miss Hawkeye, I got a little excited.  I say all of this to say, Hansel and Gretel missed the boat!  I imagine if this version of the fairy tale were in a book, it would be interesting. However, the movie misses a lot.  The plot is inconsistent and does not draw the viewer into the fable.  The movie feels cheeky at best.  There are a lot of bad movies out there that I would recommend; Hansel and Gretel is not one of them!",1377993600,,590,4.114035087719298

4781291,5,B005LAIH2M,I thought that this movie was pretty wicked. I think they did a good twist to the classic story. I thought that Jeremy and gemma did a great job as hansel and gretle. and I thought that the lady who played the main witch was also good. the story is kind of liner but that's ok if you want just a good action/horror film than this is it. this movie did have some funny parts in. one thing I did like about it that they did not make hansel and gretle to much of badass and they got their buts kicked it was realistically. and I also liked how they made them sort of like superheroes that was cool. but all in all this is a good movie you will be entertained and the special effects and makeup art was excellent. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1377907200,,765,4.006535947712418

4781293,2,B005LAIH2M,Era Inappropriate swear words used for shock? I found the use of the F**$# word very surprising as it definitely was not a word used in the era that this movie was supposed to be in. This was a fluff movie with some action and violence to keep it moving. It could have been so much more if they had hired writers for a story instead of just special effects specialists.,1377820800,,369,4.211267605633803

I was wrong; it's actually a decent movie and highly entertaining. The one-liners and obscenities sometimes seemed forced, as did the pastiche and reference, but in the end all was forgivable.
It was refreshing to see sibling protagonists, and both leads handled their characters/caricatures well. For my wife and I, the best part was the witches. I don't think I've ever seen a more compelling portrait of a classic, evil witch. The makeup, effects, and acting combined to create demonic, grotesquely demi-human creatures of nightmare and fairy tale, balancing menace, humor, and fight scene ferocity.

4781729,2,B005LAIH2M,"OMG, someone finally ripped off Van Helsing! Actually, more like  mated it with The Man with the Iron Fists. Lest it not be clear, I loathed Van Helsing. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the worst big budget films of all time. Hansel & Gretel is actually better. Not a lot better mind you, but watchable in a sort of horrifying way.

At least it feels like a single unified ""vision."" Cough cough. The film is consistent in tone. But what a strange tone! In some ways, it's a faithful spawn of the original fairy tale (or Satan), but it steals from and mashes in every conceivable bit of jazzed up bad video game / comic sensibility and time period, over-the-top and almost post-modern humor, then goes for the utter gusto.

Some interesting (and terrifying) observations about the film: It apparently cost only $50 million to make. Actually fairly cheap given the number of sets and constant fx shots. They clearly didn't spend the money on the stars. We all know Jeremy Renner to be under a curse that magically compels him to take every role offered. On the scary side H&G did over $200 million worldwide and a sequel is in production. Spare us now!

Probably the thing that most offends me is the fundamental tonal blend. At some level, one might consider this a horror film, and there is a creepy ass story that could be made out of the original fairy tale. If you lost the we-already-know-it intro and immersed us in a dark forest period village where children were being murdered and the townsfolk turned upon themselves -- that could have worked. But H&G eschews subtlety at any and all levels. The scenario makes a high level sense (i.e. you can mostly follow the ""plot""), but the world building does not. Where is this? When is this? It looks like a 19th century -- no maybe 17th -- village. But we have half-indestructible heroes, more witches than children, machine-gun crossbows, multi-stage bullets, witches better at high-wire hand to hand combat than curses, love-struct trolls, and so much more. It's just plain bizarre. There is even this major scene in the middle where a rape  and a fumbling love encounter are intercut. Woah! And weird.

Unlike its putrescent progenitor, Van Helsing, I think H&G actually leans on sets instead of CGI for the locations. They  filmed it in Germany. This leant (some) of the backgrounds a slightly realistic touch, if a bit Grim Brothers Kitsch. The post-300  costumes and props -- not so much. Also very hit or miss is the flip dialog, mostly consisting of Gretel's one liners and ham-handed exposition aimed at explaining what passes for plot. The witchy plan is so laughable that I wonder if the outline wasn't done by the writer's eight year-old son: Wait for Blood Moon, grab twelve kids (for sacrifice), plus dine on heart of Great White Whale (wait, didn't I mean Witch?).

You might wonder why I mentioned The Man with the Iron Fists, even though it's an entirely different action sub-genre. But both films take a similar (and oddball) approach at amping and aping the conventions of their betters. They place wire-flying blood-spurting quip-shouting action at the forefront, forgetting that this is meaningless if you don't actually have characters you care about. Or a world that makes sense. And both films have this Tarantino inspired tone that forbades any suspension of disbelief -- while failing to understand any of the stylistic talents of the master.

Oh yes, and shall we mention that it's pretty damn gory. Mixed in with all the camp, there are some horrific deaths here, which further lends to the incredibly odd stylistic tone. Toss into that the haphazard attempt to give both leads romantic interests. Wow, this creates some skin crawling awfulness. I didn't know who to be me more uncomfortable for: the writers, producers, actors, characters, or just me! That intercut rape scene. Shiver. Not like it's ""the ear scene"" in Reservoir Dogs or anything, but the clash of elements is so startlingly inappropriate, I don't even know what to say.

If this is the new normal, shoot me with a gatling crossbow now!

We decided to rent it one night to see just how ridiculous it was and my opinion was quickly swayed, especially after the first fight scene.  Wirkola apes Raimi almost perfectly, from the quick-cut zooms as they're gearing up to the slapstick manner he choreographs the fight scenes.

The varied design of the witches and the over the top comic violence were enjoyable as well.

4782565,5,B005LAIH2M,"ARE YOU A good witch or a bad witch? It's easy to tell in writer/director Tommy Wirkola's fantasy horror flick. These child killing, curse-casting evil-doers look as bad as they are and, boy, are they ugly. Beautifully, don't-turn-out-the-lights, Tim Burton-like ugly.

Creative make-up and costumes, steam punk weaponry, medieval fantasy sets and high flying wire work give ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" its style. The rest comes from its actors - Jeremy Renner as Hansel, Gemma Arterton as Gretel and Famke Janssen as Grand Bad Witch Muriel - and Norwegian-born Wirkola, also known for ""Dead Snow"" (2009), a nasty little gem about med students on a ski vacation who run into WWII Nazi storm trooper zombies. ""Hansel & Gretel"" is Wirkola's second film.

The movie opens with a rehash of the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm: The children's parents leave them alone in the woods; the starving kids find a house made of candy and are captured by an evil witch who intends to make a meal of them, starting with Hansel. The boy is imprisoned in a cage and forced to eat candy to fatten up, while his sister becomes the witch's slave. But, while preparing the cook fire, Gretel turns the tables on the witch and frees Hansel. Together, the two push her into the oven and save themselves.

In three minutes we're watching credits roll, while a series of woodcut illustrations updates the story.

In the ""Reinventing Hansel & Gretel"" feature available only on Blu-ray, Wirkola talks about fixating on the story as a boy. He wanted to know what happened next and, in the grand tradition of fanboys everywhere, he figured it out himself: Brother and sister go into extreme witch hunting, saving children and villages, seeking out bad magic-workers and taking care of business. There are other unique twists: Hansel is now a diabetic who must take insulin shots, a result of his first, witchy encounter. Wirkola employs a time-accurate syringe here, big enough to look like a weapon.

Sets and costumes may look like fairy tale fantasy, but the weapons and language are anything but. Dialogue is modern and f-bombs explode frequently, especially in the extended edition. The extended film is 10-minutes longer and features more gore, a brutal beating and near rape of Gretel, and a vivid moment of vomiting. Stick with the theater edition, which has plenty of fun without the disrupting excess.

As for the weapons ... they would make Rambo proud. There are Gatling cross bows, firing dozens of arrows per minute, automatic weapons, long ribbons of shells, and grenades. A good witch's spell helps make them impervious to bad juju.

Additional HD extras are ""The Witching Hours,"" about turning all those extras into individual baddies, and ""Meet Edward the Troll."" Edward is another original to Wirkola's reboot; betcha like him. Note that the extended and extras are only available on 2D Blu-ray; the 3D has the 3D with the theatrical cut, no extras; the theatrical is only available in standard-def, with no extras. Most standard Blu-rays offer both on one disc. What's with that, Paramount?

You gotta know this isn't Shakespeare; it's not even J.K. Rowling. ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is good old fashioned, B-grade movie fun. If you've got a taste for the absurd, it is a perfect popcorn movie to watch at home. (But not for young children!) Renner (""Marvel's The Avengers,"" ""The Bourne Legacy"") and Arterton (""Quantum of Solace"") have great brother-sister chemistry, trading quips and rockin' the battles. A flaming finale has them confronting 50-plus witches. ""I fire my gun and it's like turning a light on in the kitchen. Cockroaches are scrambling everywhere,"" Remmer says, laughing.

It made $54 million domestically when released in January, more than clearing cost, but made a killing, roughly $169 million, internationally - enough for Paramount to start on a sequel. I'll be watching for it, especially if Wirkola and his original cast are onboard.

4782568,4,B005LAIH2M,"MINI-REVIEW: there's a lot of action scenes in this flick as adult badass versions of Hansel and Gretel go after not just witches but a coven upon coven of witches. The dialogue is a bit modern to relate to modern audiences but whatever. Barring a few plotholes this is an above average tale with good to very good special effects, action and colorful costumes. Starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton. Some of the minor witches were the most memorable characters. Based on Grimm's ""Hansel and Gretel"" with a ton of liberties but still good enough fun. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B.

SPOILER: so Hansel has this injection he has to take every few hours or he will die and yet he gets caught up in a tree and knocked out. Assuming he wasn't up in the tree that long why was this even in the tale? Methinks it was from an earlier draft and somebody thought it would be cool even though there was no payoff.",1375833600,,915,4.446428571428571

That said, if you have no problem with rapid-fire, pistol crossbows with seemingly unlimited bolts (and no quiver), firearms, including a Gatling Gun (not invented until 1861, but, hey, who cares, right?), and while syringes were used to deliver medicines as far back as the Homeric Era, we still do not inject through clothing, nor was diabetes treated with insulin until the 20th century, then you might not be bothered by the seemingly endless string of absurdities in this mish-mash of 20th century foul language and inane plot inconsistencies.

Better suggestion: Read the book.

I am a great fan of Famke Janssen, and was looking forward to her performance. Unfortunately, her acting was so overshadowed by the poorly-written script and hard-to-follow special effects, that it was not even enjoyable.

Masking this plot and its little twisty ending is an endless stream of potty mouth mixed with hokey blood and guts.  All they do is keep running around killing the same old Witches it look like they have taken their face with plaster Paris and wiggled it to make it cracky.

They do a fair job of keeping you off balance as to who are the good guys and the bad guys but in the end it is just an action movie and that is all it is.

4783836,4,B005LAIH2M,"Ever wonder what happened to Hansel & Gretel after they escaped the witch's house? Well they sure as hell didn't get reunited with their dad! Not according to this modern take on the tale.

I'm sure there are purists out there cringing in their fairytale-loving boots at this gory retelling of a children's classic. Me - I love them. Fairytales were originally dark and gory until Disney got hold of them and cleaned up their image. I mean, come on - witches eating children for dinner is pretty dark.

And do beware; this one definitely isn't for the kiddies. It's super dark, bloody and full of language and sexual innuendos.

There are two major things I loved about this movie - Jeremy Renner, and the super cool irreverence of it all. The movie knows it's taking the piss and doesn't really care.

Starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton in the title roles, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, fast-forwards a decade after the original story. The siblings are now adults with their own business - hunting and killing witches. They are Sam and Dean Winchester of the Middle Ages, siblings hunting down evil, with just as many humorous touches as Supernatural (of which I am a HUGE fan).  For instance, seems all that sugar Hansel consumed at the witch's cottage made him a diabetic. I literally laughed out loud when at the end of the movie, poor Hansel almost loses the battle as he goes into a diabetic coma. Foiled by candy - who would have thought it!

Then you have Gretel almost getting raped by the townsfolk but then Edward comes along and rescues her. Edward the hero rides again! But instead of sparkling, this Edward is a troll who works for the witches. Doesn't stop Gretel wondering if perhaps Edward is her true love after all.  And as someone who can swear like a fishmonger's wife myself at times, I had to laugh at the coarse language in a fairytale.

Over the last decades, witches have become hip in Hollywood. Instead of being villains, they've become the heroes, or at least, the beautiful side-kick to the heroes. Think Bonnie in The Vampire Diaries, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

Hansel and Gretel brings back the super ugly witches (even if one is played by the super hot Famke Jansen uglied up with makeup). These witches make the Wicked Witch of the West look like a Girl Scout selling cookies. There was one question the movie left me with. Does having sex in a healing pool act like a condom?

All in all, a much better retelling than Snow White and the Huntsman, or Red Riding Hood.",1374710400,,2551,4.636363636363637
4783837,3,B005LAIH2M,"""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is based on one concept that you will find either interesting or silly. That is, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), now grown up, make a living as witch hunters in some alternate medieval universe, where Famke Janssen is a big bad witch planning to do something very evil.

Because of the film's thin plotline, we are not allowed to know who these siblings are or what they really want to do. Hansel and Gretel are determined to eliminate all the witches because, well, those witches are bad, aren't they? Peter Stormare, typecast as always, is a corrupt sheriff.

With this setting and casting, ""Hansel & Gretel"" is meant to be (campy) fun, which it is not, because of the heavy-handed direction from Tommy Wirkola. Here is a great material for fun movie, but, like in his ""Dead Snow,"" a Norwegian horror comedy about undead German soldiers, the director fails to fully develop the potential of the film.

What we get here is so-so action sequences that are enjoyable and forgettable. The leading players Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton look fine, but they deserve a much better story.",1374710400,4,1137,4.850515463917525

Honestly, I was thinking 'Gretel as a leather clad biker lookin' chick with a hot looking brother? Probably going to be cliche' at best, B-Grade at worst.'  But I was pleasantly surprised!

The plot was the same...kids are left in the woods, nifty house to eat, wicked witch to eat the kids, etc., etc. But I really liked the alternate explanation of the how the kids wound up out there and lost...and why.

The acting was great, even if Gretel's character was a bit snooty around the edges, special affects were believable and supporting cast was much better than I expected. Probably wouldn't watch it more than once every couple of years if I owned it but I wouldn't leave the house if visiting a friend who had it playing, so am hoping that Amazon keeps it around til 2015!

All in all, I really enjoyed the movie. More reliable still, my 22 year old son, Mikey, liked it.

4783995,1,B005LAIH2M,"Don't do it!
Save your $6, wait 6 months and this will be on network TV and you can watch it for free, or better yet, don't bother.

Seriously, how they got Jeremy Renner to do this movie, I'll never know.

This is a horrible movie and takes the lead as the worst movie my wife and I have ever sat through. (yes, we watched all of it, which I suppose does say something for the movie)
It's basically a really bad 'zombie' type action movie, except the zombies in this case are evil witches with special powers.

Possibly teenagers may enjoy this, I did laugh twice (I'm sure the 'director' did not intend humor).
I realize I'm light on details and analysis but that's because I don't want to have to 'think' anymore about this movie.

Look, we all like to forget about reality and lose ourselves in a movie, possibly this movie does achieve that but just watching the flicker rate on your TV screen would also do that.

I am only adding a review because this movie is currently rated at 3-1/2 stars! I feel I just have to warn you.

Some of the other reviews mentioned Blade, Van Helsing, Zombieland and I would add any of the Resident Evil movies, of these I would say it's on par with Van Helsing, possibly slightly better only because of a few explicit special effects.

4784066,4,B005LAIH2M,"HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an hilariously creative film that completely restored my faith in the whole subgenre of horror-comedy--it's more of the latter, of course. While obviously nothing to be taken too seriously, this film does have a solid, cohesive plot-line with some nice surprises. The Sabbat scene is particularly worthy of mention. Expert filming and settings, makeup, eclectic soundtrack, and intentionally stupid but nonetheless lively script. Great props too--love the automatic crossbows and blunderbusses. While it could have gone a little farther in such areas, it makes some interesting revelations concerning Hansel and Gretel's familiar past, adding some interesting elaborations to the Grimm Bros' original tale as well as the entire mythos regarding ""medieval"" witches. While this film is mostly its own original self, the borrowings and bits of spoof on WIZARD of OZ, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, KING KONG, RED DAWN, and a score of others really add something to the mix.",1374451200,,994,5.419354838709677

4784218,4,B005LAIH2M,"Without a doubt Hansel & Gretel is cliched and a bit over the top,but in every good way imaginable.  The performances are fun and each role seems perfectly cast here. The atmosphere is dark and brooding with striking visuals to boot. I was actually surprised with how well this film looked and I would even argue on a purely visual level Hansel & Gretel stands pound for pound with heavy weights such as the Hobbit. Without a doubt this movie packs in a well balanced formula of horror and fantasy and it does it seemlessly with enough action and gore for good measure. Heads are blown off,a giant troll smashes human bodies without remorse,the witches show no mercy here and the movie does offer some shock value as well.
With all that said,Hansel & Gretel is one of those movies you can watch and quickly forget about afterwords (Think 2004's  Van Helsing with R rated bent to it). For all it's gorgeous and horrendous sights theirs nothing here that really sticks with you when its all said and done. It's serves it purpose and then lets you move on.

3D: Wow! I was really,happily surprised here. The opening credits are amazing and the movie as a whole packs enough 3D depth and pop out effect to warrant a repeat viewing for the 3D alone. It definitely adds to the overall experience and is a keeper in my 3D library.

4784760,5,B005LAIH2M,"Sometimes I feel like movie critic reviews need to treat each movie differently based upon what it is trying to do.  If you treat every movie like it's out to win the Oscar for Best Picture, you're going to find a lot of ""terrible"" movies.  This is one of them.  It is not in contention for an Oscar.  It's there for entertainment purposes, and entertain it does.  Most people skip movies like this in theatres because we don't care to pay $20 for a one-time viewing.  We wait, and buy it on Bluray for the same price and can then watch it repeatedly and enjoy it every time.  How many times can you watch an Oscar-winning movie before the ""art"" and ""charm"" start to wear you down?  This movie claims no art and charm and instead provides just shy of two hours filled with enjoyable action scenes.  Yes, it's preposterous but they put their money and effort into making cool fight scenes that make you feel happy and forget about life for a bit.  Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a fun escape from reality that will be plucked repeatedly from your shelf for repeated watching while the Oscar winners gather dust.

I would definitely recommend this movie.",1373587200,,553,4.54
4784833,5,B005LAIH2M,"I loved Dead Snow, so buying this movie was an easy choice for me.  (I was also happy to learn that they are working on a sequel to Hansel & Gretel.  I look forward to that with great anticipation.)
I bought this version of the film because I'm a sucker for a label that dares to suggest `intense new footage NOT seen in theaters.'  I'm not a timid soul, if you've got an uncensored version of anything I want to see it.

Love steampunk, loved the fanciful weaponry used throughout.  Loved that a lot of the action takes place in the wilderness (their interior fight sequences were less successful due to poor lighting).  Loved that the movie was both grim and humorous (it needed to work a lot harder to be dead on funny though).  As for the acting, of the lot Famke Janssen served the movie best as Muriel a witch with a diabolical plan.  Gemma Arterton was also fantastic as Gretel.  Less successful was Jeremy Renner as Hansel, he seemed terribly uncomfortable trying to exist in this wacky world of witches.  Concerning the claim of inconsistent action, yes, a lot of the fighting sequences were straight out of the Looney Tunes handbook of silly, but so what.  Realism was not their aim!  And yes, the story is a bit simplistic; but this is not the type of movie that requires complications to hold our interest.  There is no earth shattering reveal, no twist, nothing surprising or unexpected, it's pretty straight forward.  The plot concerns the siblings Hansel & Gretel who have issues that will never be resolved as long as there are witches to hunt down and exterminate.  They are bounty hunters.  They get paid to do one thing.  That's what this movie is all about.  I don't know how that confused some critics, but it obviously did.

For me, the only questionable scene (that was added afterwards) involves an attempted gang rape.  How that got tossed into the mix is anyone's guess, especially as it serves no purpose other than to confuse the intent of the the filmmakers.  It literally came out of left field.
Other than that, I have no additional complaints.  It's a keeper!",1373587200,,2091,4.609756097560975

But they added a lot of action and so many twists that you can barely sense the original story of Hansel and Gretel. But as I said, it benefits this movie format. Buy it or rent it, it is worth the time. I buy a lot of movies as I am terrible returning movies.

4785302,4,B005LAIH2M,"I received my copy of this movie from Netflix.  This review may contain spoilers.

The fairy tale Hansel and Gretel was the worst case scenario straight from a kid's handbook on survival: You're out in the woods and discover a delicious house made out of candy and sweets.  It's like you died and went to heaven.  Then, you encounter the cannibal witch who lives inside.  And suddenly, you wish you'd stumbled upon a nice apple tree instead.  This witch has a thing for roasted kindergarteners, and right now you and your sibling are looking real tasty.  What do you do?

The brother and sister duo serve up a little comeuppance in the opening scene of Hansel and Gretel:Witch Hunters.  From there, they answer a calling that includes hunting and destroying some really nasty looking ladies.  These magical wielding creatures make Bellatrix Lestrange, the Voldemort serving witch from Harry Potter, look like a very nice and pretty lady.  A trail of missing children always leads Hansel and Gretel to the guilty offender.  So, when a town begins noticing an unusually high number of child abductions, the mayor contacts Hansel and Gretel to solve the mysterious disappearances.

But of course, there's a hater.  I mean, there's always a hater.  In this case, the local Sheriff is none too pleased to have the sister and brother butt-kicking team in his town.  He attempts to undermine their investigation at every opportunity.  Typical hater behavior.

As Hansel and Gretel dig deeper into the cause of the kidnappings, they learn more and more about the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of their parents long ago.  Which up until this point, they've been a little bitter about.  I guess you would too if you were left behind in the woods with a witch who likes to ingest rug rats.  The two witch hunters manage to unravel the truth all while looking smoking hot in black leather.

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film with the negative reviews it received from critics.  Metacritic gave it an average score of 21 (out of 100), while Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 14% (out of 100%).  After watching the movie, I think the lower ranking scores are a little unfair.  I enjoyed Hansel and Gretel:Witch Hunters.  I appreciated the more action-packed approach they took to an old fairy tale.  There has been an emergence of modern fairy tales over the last few years on TV and in movies.  If you like shows like Grimm or Once Upon a Time, you should enjoy Hansel and Gretel.  I thought it was a much better adaptation than Red Riding Hood with Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman.

The movie isn't bad.  The plot is a little predictable, and the focus is definitely on the action sequences.  But, it's like watching Expendables 2 and expecting an Oscar award winning performance from the cast.  Who does that?  You want explosions, barely audible one liners from Sylvester Stallone, and Jason Statham round housing villains in the forehead, right?

Hansel, played by Jeremy Renner (Avengers, Hurt Locker) had great sibling chemistry with Gretel, played by Gemma Arterton (Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia:Sands of Time).  There were also good supporting performances from other actors.  The haterade Sheriff was none other than Peter Stormare, who tends to always play ""that Russian guy"" or some other form of Eastern European/Scandinavian character.  In fact, he was the Russian astronaut in Armageddon.  I had a hard time seeing the sexy Famke Janssen play an ugly witch.  But, the talented actress pulls it off, and pretty much makes you want to punch her in the face.  A lot.

The movie is definitely full of blood and gore.  Be warned if you're squeamish.  While the film takes place in a medieval-like setting, the society has gadgets and weapons with modern ingenuity that were very tongue in cheek.  I'm still trying to figure out where Gretel got those hot leather pants.  I say this so you're not sitting there like, ""C'mon! Where did Gretel get hot leather pants?""  Don't take this move too seriously.  Sit back, relax, eat your microwave movie butter popcorn, turkey dogs, and Rotel nacho dip, and enjoy.",1373328000,,4135,4.856733524355301

Hansel and Gretel both survive way too much physically and employ weaponry out of keeping with their times.  ""Van Helsing"" with Hugh Jackman suffered equally.  The last several ""Die Hards"" did not win audiences - same issues.  The story lines will carry the movie if the director and writers keep it real enough.  Action scenes are great and most of the reason for the movie in the first place but be creative, not impossible violent.  Hans comes across as a hard-headed idiot who would die in his first encounter against an experienced witch with magical powers.  Gretel doesn't impress either.  Neither have wards nor talents that should win against magical foes.  Why wait so long to have magically blessed bullets and weapons?  Tossing in a troll opened the door for lots more imagination but writers stopped there.  Oh well.

It takes the Grimm fairytale of Hansel and Gretel, and lets you see them as grown up witch hunters (instead of kids escaping from cannibal witches who live in candy houses). As for children viewing it, well, if you would read your kids the true original Hansel and Gretel story, then this is definitely not any worse than that - or them watching the fight-action in GI Joe. As for the movie, the acting is great, some of the tongue-in-cheek lines are hilarious, the dialog in general is very good, the cinematography is top-line, and the story is very good and flowing, with a great finish. I give it 4-stars because of a couple of things that happened in the movie, that were 'too formulaic' to a tragic adventure that I thought didn't 'have to' happen, but did. Just my perspective, I don't think that would affect everyone who watches it. Don't believe all the 3-stars and less, I think there are a lot of 'hard-core-horror' fans out there watching this, then bashing it because it is 'soft'. It isn't meant to be horror, but adventure.

As the title characters, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do what they can with woefully underwritten roles, but the movie itself quickly degenerates into a succession of redundant action and fight sequences (inexplicably, with modern firepower) that fail to excite either the imagination or the pulse and that ultimately go nowhere.

3) 20th century gadgets (machine guns, six shooters, syringes, rapid fire crossbows, wristwatches, etc.), dialogue and martial arts moves. Oh, and lots of f-bombs.

Right.  Reminds me of a similar movie, Little Red Riding Hood, with the same weird mix as above.

4786560,3,B005LAIH2M,"There have been quite a few ""Fairytale Films"" going around lately (Jack the Giant Slayer, Snow White, etc). Some are clever. Some are charming. Still others are action adventures. This film is pure dreck with a chuckle or two thrown in.

Is there room for dreck on the big screen? Sure! I grew up in the 50's when Sci-Fi B Movies were are the rage. Dreck can be fun.

Here we have a hip, modern day pair of bad ass assassins for hire. It turns out that there are HUNDREDS of witches in the forrest. H & G make a good living exterminating them. It's sort of like ""Ghost Busters on Broomsticks"".

The talented cast does its best with the awful script. Just hearing the sanguine siblings call each other Hansel or Gretel (""Hey Gretel--get ready to kick some ass"") is silly enough to make you grimace. Now, if this whole thing had been played for laughs, it might have been halfway decent. Unfortunately, this film takes itself seriously-and that's where the Gingerbread cookie crumbles.

This is not recommended for the little ones. The witches are First-Class scary. The oven? Forget about it!  A guaranteed nightmare for kids under 5. Wholesome family entertainment this is NOT. It is rated R.

If you are in the mood to see a ridiculously bad popcorn flick, you will not be disappointed.",1372550400,,1287,4.62280701754386

Well, maybe some of the special effects with the witches were good, but in general, it was a dismal flop. Jeremy Renner must have owed somebody a big favor and gotten roped into this loser. In this version, Hansel and Gretel have very modern-looking weapons (never explained). Language is modern (dialogue is lame and uninspired), outfits are corny costume medieval, and there are no twists or turns in the plodding plot. Hansel and Gretel have a weird incesty thing going on. Hansel starts to have a relationship with a beautiful white witch, who dies (sorry for the ""spoiler"") and no one seems terribly upset about it, least of all Hansel, who can't wait to be back with his sister, I guess.

There are a couple of really funny one-liners  worked into the movie that I really enjoyed, special effects are very believable and not fake looking. Cons... some of the action scenes are a bit drawn out and I think they could have done more to set up the storyline in the beginning of the movie.

Its a children's title but obviously adults will love it. ever since matrix came out everybody's been doing it but it really seems to work here. I had a great time while I was thereit took me away to another place I thoroughly enjoyed it and that's why I give it 5 stars I'm pretty critical and normally don't even Rate movies but I just loved this one,1372204800,,431,4.08235294117647

I would imagine now that outside Batman, he doesn't get the roles he used to and that's a pity, because he's a great actor. Expect some humor, intentional and not.

I like fantasy just not a crappy background for the characters.  Love mystery.  Makes stories great but the mystery of handsel and Gretel background I would say the writer lacks imaginations and is boring in idea on background for characters.  Not really realistic as far as linking their mom mysterious background.  Too be honest if they just left it a mystery or wrote a better history the show be a 5 star I nearly put 1 star because it was just too crappy of a background.  Love story plots.

It's not Oscar material or even life-altering, but I didn't think it was a waste of my time either.  I actually thought the only thing that detracted from the movie were the few times the f-word was used: it seemed forced and used more as a habit than because it was necessary to the story.

Hansel and Gretel grow up to hunt witches in a rather R-rated fashion.  They are very good at what they do but come across a situation involving a whole lot of witches and one very powerful witch that tests their abilities and reveals why they are particularly good at their job,as the plot unfolds.

A good story but easily guessed where it goes next.  Zero potential for a second movie.  What witches are, their motivation other than...arrrg, let's harm decent folk who are just minding their own business, is left out.

These writers have imaginations that are unbelievable. They tie the ancient fairy tale up with a neat ribbon of witchcraft(which is in the original story) and season it with fast action/great special effects/and just good acting. No actor or actress is a disappointment
in their portrayals. At the theater I saw it in 3-D, however the DVD lacks nothing in ""punch or excitement.""
I wonder if in the sequel there will be male witches(warlocks). Remember what century we live in? The ERA of P.C.

Was it a fun watch for a Friday night - heck yeah! CGI was pretty durn good, the casting was decent - Jeremy Renner did an unexpectedly good job in a lighter role - he is kind of an intense guy and he made it work perfectly for this show.

Well, worth streaming for $3.99. It was one of those where I turned to the husband and said, ""That was fun"" instead of screaming at the TV to give me my $3.99 back. I recommend it, just go into it with an open mind and ready for a fun couple of hours of mind candy. Oh, parent alert - F-bombs, which were not really necessary.

I was wrong. This is far from anything the Grimm lads ever dreamed of. It is well written, well directed, and well acted. The computer graphics and make up are flawless, special effects are dazzling and it is a story you can get into, no matter what your age.

It has gore, violence, explosions, humor, gunfire, nudity, adult situations, adult language, magic, witches....I swear, you will feel like you are in school again!  Okay, okay!  Not ever school has magic.

Definitely worth renting or owning. This is a top-notch production from MTV Films. The funniest gag was the old English milk bottles with handwritten MISSING KIDS information tied on them.

Yes, it is FANTASY, so don't expect to apply logic to this movie. I didn't see anything that stood out as openly ridiculous (within in the context of the fantasy genre)and felt the movie was cohesive from scene to scene. Great soundtrack, too!

With a Snickers, you get all sorts of good stuff wrapped up in this chocolate package that actually sticks to ya for a bit, wherein cotton candy, while sweet to the taste, usually ends up being more fluffy air than candy substance. With Hansel and Gretel, you get witches and witch hunters with karate skills that would make Chuck Norris proud, and more fancy gadgets that would make James Bond green with envy. Lots of fight and chase scenes where the good guys tend to get their butts handed to them before squeaking out a win in the end.  And you cant have a fairy tale witch hunting movie in Austria (or wherever) without a gatlin gun conveniently handy............yes, a gatlin gun, who would have thunk it. Most will say, ""hey, lighten up, this is entertainment"". Does that mean you kick out all good sense and logic and overdose on a bad case of silly to be entertained?

It's like, how was this not thought of before? The whole movie is really clever and filled with one-liners and hilariously gratuitous violence. The characters are original and deep and all of them are equally badass in their own way.

 Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are both top notch actors and both shined every second that they were on the screen. The acting, the story, the dialogue and the soundtrack were all flawless there's not a single thing that could have been changed for the better.

It's not like they were shooting to win an Oscar when they made this film. They were obviously going for a good time, and they accomplished that. The witches are not scary, which is a good thing for a person like me who is easily frightened. But they do make the witches down right vicious, so you are rooting for their deaths.

Take your classic Hansel and Gretel and turn them into ninja fighters with weapons and you have this take on the tale. The witches were well done and offered some graphic eye candy.  There was a love interest for Hansel and a little suprise at the end that differs from our classic story.  All in all I was entertained and would watch this again.",1371600000,,488,4.511363636363637

Hansel. You're really bringing me down. And he said
Gretel? You can really be a bitch.

He said I've wasted my life! On our stupid legend. When my one and only love. Was the wicked witch.

(Ah, Laurie Anderson is freakin' amazing for that) Sorry. on to the actual movie review...

This is a really cool movie that was action packed from start to end and didn't have any slow points really as it told the ""What if this happened?"" tale of Hansel and Gretel. Love, Love - LOVE Jeremy Renner. He's amazing in every role I've seen from Dahmer to Hurt Locker to this. Not really for kids below 13 and some of the bad witches are pretty scary for kids perhaps. Teens and young adults are probably more the crowd they were aiming for. The weapons are bad ass, as are the costumes and actors. It's good vs. evil & a twist I won't spoil your movie with revealing here. Worth a rental for sure and even a repeated viewing some rainy day though.",1371513600,,1139,4.283720930232558

Great action flick with wonderful graphics and a decent story line. Absolutely ADORE Jeremy in this one! It is far from Jeremy's best performance, but Hansel isn't the deepest character to begin with so it shouldn't be expected. And Gemma's Gretel really steals the show!

The weapons are not appropriate for the time period they are in, but then again the costumes aren't exactly wholly authentic either - if you're going to watch this you have to be willing to allow them these artistic licenses...

There IS a lot of action - no shortage of witches to be killed.  And unlike the wizards in Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings (who don't seem to actually do much magic), these witches can do all kinds of cool stuff, so in that aspect it's kind of fun to watch.

There are those that want to make an art film which does not get it for me. I am good at spotting those and avoiding the cost of getting them in 3-D. They work as DVDs fine and are much less expensive. Now having said all that , these folks knew what they were doing even if I was not pleased with the focus. I counted as many as five layers in some shots . Some do jump at, past, and beyond you. Yes much of the film feels like a stage presentation but you are there.

The movie deserves 3 stars for the attempt to rewrite a classic, for the action and for the compulsory gratuitous nude scene.

4788810,4,B005LAIH2M,"Some reviews for this movie were not so great at first but they improved so I decided to give it a try. For the genre, this movie is much better than I anticipated.

Characters: Fun, actors are great.

Storyline: For this type movie, not bad. This movie kept my attention from beginning to end. It's about Hansel and Gretel, witch hunters. They finally encounter a big bad witch with a bunch of minions that take a little more effort than usual to kill which makes up 75% of the movie. The plot thickens and intertwines giving it a lot more depth and character development.

Action: Lots of it from beginning to end. Neat fight scenes and weapons. This movie is somewhat fast paced.

Bad language: Yep, there are a few bad words. Mostly the ""F"" word a few times but maybe a half dozen times at most.

Graphics/Special Effects: Pretty good, I enjoyed them. In my opinion, nothing looked cheesy, cheap nor ""B"" rated. Everything looked real and I never felt the makers did a poor job. (One reviewers said something about seeing wires, I never saw any)

Costumes/Makeup: Very good. Again, nothing cheap, cheesy nor ""B"" rated. Some of the witches had interesting makeup.

There are people exploding, getting shredded, getting their heads blown off, hanged, burned and eating bugs. However, they don't dwell on such scenes and its not too graphic for squeamish people. No kids get killed.

If you are looking for something fun to watch, this movie delivers especially if you like these type movies. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. 4 stars.",1371254400,,1543,4.710037174721189

4788862,5,B005LAIH2M,"You probably do not expect much from this movie.  The premise is silly.  But this movie takes a traditional and creepy fairy tale and turns it on its head.  The action is exciting, violent, and gory.  There is a lot of it too, which makes the movie nonstop fun.  These two hunters take a lot of damage, like two John McClanes of the fairy tale universe.

The witches look horrifying and have interesting physical aspects.  The setting is somewhat dark Renaissance.  Just after the utilization of gunpowder, which allows Hansel & Gretel to carry around the coolest guns I've seen in a while.  This might turn off fantasy purists but excite steampunk lovers and the like.

The troll and the good witches are neat additions.  The characters are all fun to watch, even the extras.  Every character has a purpose too.

There are a few plot twists and a lot of fun scenes.  Great experience.

Of course, the acting is excellent.  Hansel & Gretel are rough and tumble heroes who get into a LOT of fights.  Their dialogue is a little modernized, but often funny and fitting.

If you love fantasy and action, you have to at least least rent this one.  It's a gem.  In fact, if this could have been given another hour and some depth of story it would rank up there with LOTR.",1371254400,,1265,4.488986784140969

However, that's part of the charm. I know this movie isn't good, but I still can't help but like it. It's dumb, mostly nonsensical, and ridiculously gory (or rather, full of gore that's ridiculous). That being said, I watched this movie twice in the theater and ordered the 3D version so that I can own my own copy to view at my leisure.

The costumes and make up were also very nice, making the witches suitably evil.  I did think the weapons were mighty inventive but somehow, their contrivances felt ""familiar"".  The story wasn't at all deep or meaningful;  for what they were trying to do it didn't have to be, nor was I expecting as such...In the end it wasn't something I'd let my little ones see what with all the cussin', but as far as being entertaining, well, Hansel and Gretal did its job.",1371168000,2,620,4.491071428571429

This is the type of movie I wished Mortal Kombat was. People get torn apart, explode with guts and brains spewing all over the place, head stomped like grapes, etc. If you enjoy fun violence like a Robert Rodriguez flick (Front Dusk Til Dawn, Machete, Planet Terror) then you will like the action here. The runtime is short, and thats a good thing. We have Witch Hunters, and they are hunting witches. The end. We don't want it longer. Very fun movie that will get repeat viewings from me.

The story is great, the production is great, the visual effects are flawless, it is funny and gory.
Zoe Bell (the witch with the ram horns on her shoulders) is absolutely incredible during the movies first real fight scene.
Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner compliment each other very well as siblings, which really provides a great deal of depth to the story.

Sure, some good people might have been involved in this, but that's a risk worth taking . . . There's plenty of good people out there who were not involved in this trash . . .

4788976,1,B005LAIH2M,"I admit it, I was intrigued by the premise and the cast.  The idea of Hansel and Gretel growing up and going after witches made me think this film, absurd as it sounded, could actually get some things right the terrible Van Helsing film didn't, or at least be amusing as it failed.  I was very wrong...

First of all, the effects are terrible.  It looks like something you would see in a cheap Sci Fi channel flick.  At least there you aren't paying for it and know what you're getting going in.  From the troll to the witches 'flying' on their tree branches, it had the look of a student film.

Second, the acting.  I have liked Renner's work in the past, same for Famke Janssen.  Arterton has always been nice to look at.  There was nothing to show any of them had looked at the lines until five seconds before the cameras rolled.  Decent actors trying to make the best of what they had to work with, which leads us to...

The writing.  This story is so lame it would be laughable except for all of the above.  Hansel and Gretel get separated at one point.  When he regains consciousness does he try to find his sister or at least figure out if she's alive?  No, instead he takes a roll in the hay with the local wench who turns out to be (wait for it...) a good witch!  A witch who can't do magic or anything else you would really associate with being a witch, but a witch.  How she knows I'm not sure.

Seriously, if you are looking for over the top funny horror, go back to the classics like Evil Dead (the original) films or Shaun of the Dead.  You'll thank me for it later.",1371168000,4,1580,4.203333333333333

I guess my best description of the movie is that it is a comical, yet bloody romp through a fantasy world of witches.
I bought the movie mainly for my 3D collection.  The 3D effects are some of the best I have seen.  The 3D quality is equal to that of Avatar, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Strange Tides, and Alice in Wonderland.

4789164,3,B005LAIH2M,"Hansel & Gretel Witchhunters- Unrated Cut.
I can give this a rating- crappy.
 Yes I knew it was an over the top fun romp thru the famous fable.
The original fable is gruesome and designed to frighten the begeezus out of children, and parts of this film will certainly do that.
The really gnarly parts make one say: Whoa!! They really did that to those children!??
 Most scenes are less 'hide your eyes' worthy, and are actually quite comical.
 My main problems with this film are the production qualities. At times it just looks crappy. It can be choppy, and out of focus in some scenes.
Granted some of this is due to the streaming qualities, but some parts are obvious flaws in tech.
Apparently this was meant to be a 3D feature with axes and arrows and blood splats into the camera. Fun actually, but if it is not streamed in a 3d format with glasses or whatever, it just looks like crap.
Acting; What's his face, Renner just walks thru this one. Did he film this on days off from Avengers shooting?
Gemma Arterton who I saw in Clash of the Titans was very good~! She looks amazingly hot and her acting was nice. I approve!
Famke Jannsen- Looks great! Acts like she is enjoying the villain role, which she eats up! Very good.
To sum it up; This movie, on the whole, is junk. There are better 'over the top just for the sake of fun'  movies out there.
Pass this one.
P.S. The sound sucks big-time.",1371081600,,1399,4.369230769230769
4789165,3,B005LAIH2M,"Hansel and Gretel was decent. The story was good, but I did not like how they did not stick to a time period specific acting. Dropping of f-bombs and other cursing just takes away from the heart of the picture. There is one scene with partial nudity and alot of cursing.

Don't get me wrong, I am not a prude, but this movie did not need those things. Had the movie been more like ""The Brothers Grimm"" I may have enjoyed it more. In my eyes, this film tries way to hard to be something it isn't.

Final review. It is a good movie to rent but I would not waste my money on a purchase. The movie did not leave me wanting to watch it again. I mentioned ""The Brothers Grimm"" in my review and that movie I have seen more than a dozen times and I enjoy every time I watch it. This movie doesn't even come close to that.",1371081600,,813,4.012345679012346
4789166,3,B005LAIH2M,"Based loosely on the Grimm Brothers fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel it follows a similar vain to previous movies in the fantasy genre.  Special clothing and weapons uncommon to that time period make them more dashing, but they aren't so different from what we have seen in other movies.  We first see Hansel and Gretel kill an evil witch after their parents sent them into the woods.  Then a collage of posters and news sheets show us what happened as they grow up.  As adults they save a white magic witch from the Sheriff.  Next they prepare to go after a meeting of the witches for the orange moon.  Meanwhile when they both get separated in the woods, the Sheriff and his men make the mistake of hurting Gretel while a troll is watching.  We learn Gretel's secret as to why the troll goes after the Sheriff and his men.  The sets and costumes are well done and the acting isn't bad, nor even the music although a bit grating at the end.  Somehow it doesn't quite have the pinnache of the Grimm Brothers or Van Helsing.  Nothing seemed new or different about it so I felt I was just along for the ride.  Certainly worth a rental, but I can't recommend a purchase unless you are a huge fan of one of the actors and fantasy.  I purchased the Blu-ray and the video and sound quality are excellent.  It includes extras along with a digital copy.  Rated R mainly because of the gore, colorful language, and some nudity but I would say it's more of 14+ movie not an R based on what is out there already.

4789167,4,B005LAIH2M,"Somebody once told me, you could tell within the first 5 minutes if this movie was for you or not. I don't quite know where that cut off was in the film, but judging from the opening scenes I would assume he was correct. Hansel and Gretel are forced into the woods, seemingly abandoned by their parents. They find the candy cottage and the rest of the story plays out like you remember. The witch captures them, and then they kill her. The actual movie and story are what happens after that, and mostly because of it. Seeing the little kids kill the witch elicits a very interesting reaction. You will either be turned off by the blood, and overall cheesiness of the scene. Or you will smile and turn your brain off for the next 90 minutes. I chose to do the later, and so should you.

This movie reminded me a lot of Van Helsing, and was about as poorly received. This movie suffers from a lot of the same issues as Van Helsing however. It is corny, poorly written, tends to go to far with CGI. But it also shares a lot of the same strengths. Good action, neat weapons and concepts, and lovely atmosphere. It also pulls off the Horror comedy role pretty decently. From Hansel having Diabetes from being force fed candy while younger, to the stalker superfan that just wants to be part of the team. The movie gets quite a few laughs, and kept me entertained for its duration.

If you are not a fan of blood, feel free to pass this one up. It is by no means a gory film, but it does have more then most films these days. Seeing witches cut into many different pieces flying at the screen for example. I bet that scene made good use of the 3D offered in theaters.

If you still are not convinced if this is a movie for you, Let me leave you with the best line from it. ""I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket."" If that line doesn't do it for you, nothing else in this movie will.

4789211,3,B005LAIH2M,"This film was a surprise in that it was far better than I expected it to be. The initial purpose in purchasing it was that it appeared silly, there are times when well done foolishness is just what you want.
The spin on witches was excellently conceived, there was an great detail given to provide something creepy and new. They succeeded impressively.
Where it falls is in the atavism. Certain amounts are fine, as in the beginning when they were putting pictures of missing children tied to milk bottles. It is when they break out of their own rules that it becomes a problem.
Hansel and Gretel are equipped with not only automatic weapons but a taser. Everyone else in this environment is reduced to the standard medieval peasant weaponry of pitchforks and torches along with basic ball and powder guns (with the exception of the ""Sheriff"" who carries a six shooter).
Some of the plot points are cliche and painfully obvious but thankfully they do not factor largely into the overall development. Along these lines, though, are the reasons why I was pleasantly surprised by ""Hansel and Gretel"".
While trying to avoid spoilers I will say that as you're sitting there thinking, ""Okay, this is going to happen"", the opposite develops.
At points I was reminded slightly of Terry Gilliam; the dark use of strange subject matter. If this sort film is not to your taste than avoid it.
If, however, you are intrigued by the bizarre it is worth at least one viewing. Just realize that you are dealing with Hansel and Gretel, a certain amount of credulity is required.

H&GWH suffers from inadequate lighting, many scenes virtually indeiscernible.  One has to question the duo's success when they get their butts kicked quite often.

And the idea of a sequel to the basic Hansel and Gretel story intrigued me.  Jeremy Renner somewhat reminds me of a cross between Mark Wahlberg and Daniel Craig with, for the character he plays, a bit of the dark side and comedian thrown in. What also interested me was the human darkness besides the witch threat.  I liked the look of the film and the idea that they avoided a lot of CGI in favor of more traditional effects and animatronics.

It is definitely NOT a kids film, though.  Lots of violence and blood, especially the first appearance of the troll.  But, after that, the presence of the troll in the film reminded me of the ""Labyrinth"" characters.  Overall, the film had a kind of ""Van Helsing"" vibe to it, too.

4789447,5,B005LAIH2M,"I think this movie took exactly the right tone.  It was an action movie that made fun of itself.  It is not meant to be anything too deep and thought provoking.  It was simply a shoot em up kind of movie with magic and high tech medieval weapons.  It is, of course, based after the fairy tale.  The premise is, after Hansel and Gretel kill the witch they start hunting witches once they grow up.  The rest of the story is pretty easy to follow.  It does try to throw in a couple twists, but like I said it is not a movie that is all that deep or complicated.

This is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It has a lot of over the top violence and gore, bad language and sexual innuendo (along with some brief nudity).  If those things turn you off to a movie skip this altogether, because if you dislike that stuff you will hate this.  It is special effects laden, but unlike some movies I do not think that the special effects dominated.  There was enough non green screen scenes to balance it out.  It looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  I do not have a 3D player/TV so I am not sure how that version of the movie is, but Disc 2 has the unrated version of the film as a non 3D version and the A/V quality of that was great.

You will likely already have an idea whether a movie like this appeals to you or not.  If you are a fan of the genre, it is worth purchasing.  If you are lukewarm to movies like this, then stick with a rental.",1370908800,4,1453,4.042105263157895

4789449,1,B005LAIH2M,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The direction is unpleasant and claustraphobic.  The script is nonsensical.  The acting is wooden, and I'm being charitable.  Jeremy Renner should have his SAG card revoked for this mess.  when you watch you simply cannot believe that he was nominated for not ONE but TWO academy awards!  The much vaulted make-up is tacked on or falling off depending on the scene.  The stunts are rather unimpressive.
I would say that the one thing that comes across more than anything else in this travesty is how profoundly everyone involved seems completely uninvolved.  Sort of like everyone knew it was a turkey and just couldn't work up the energy to do anything well.",1370908800,,708,4.793388429752066

4789453,4,B005LAIH2M,"As the synopsis states, this is a grown-up Hansel & Gretel. Having killed the witch who tried to eat them as children, the siblings begin making witch-hunting their job traveling from town to town ridding the land of the dark evil with considerable skill and clever gadgets. This steampunk, adult fairy tale is as dark and gruesome as it is smart and funny. Think Van Helsing meets Underworld.

While the over-the-top violence was a bit much for my taste, it was rounded out by plenty of humor. And the though a bit predictable, the acting was solid. I especially loved Jeremy Renner's understated performance, as well as Famke Janssen's evil witch persona. This fun, action-packed adventure is packed with suspense, mystery, romance, and excitement. I like that the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's a mindless action flick with entertaining characters and a fresh take on a well-known fairy tale.

4789454,5,B005LAIH2M,I saw this movie in theaters and I will say that I went in loving it because A. Jeremy Renner played Hansel and B. Gemma Arterton is beautiful and I enjoyed her as Gretel the movie has over the top action humor extreme violence from heads being stepped on to heads being shot off if you're into that sort of thing. I was very satisfied with this movie and it is a buy for me!,1370736000,6,375,4.013333333333334
4789455,4,B005LAIH2M,"Great cast, funny one-liners, and lots of pretty people. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action-packed flick that will keep you entertained the entire time.  Sure it won't win any Oscars any time soon but if you're looking to be pulled into a fantasy world for two hours, this movie is it.",1370736000,,296,4.584905660377358

4789497,2,B005LAIH2M,"I wouldn't waste my money on this film. The acting was sub-par ----which I'm very disappointed abt because I was really looking forward to seeing Famke Janssen (from Nip/Tuck). The plot itself was riddled with holes: the beginning was relatively incomplete in explaining how ""Hansel&Gretel"" came to be. Positively, the special effects were pretty nice, as was the location in which the film was shot. If you have hours (and money) to kill, by all means, kill a few brain cells with this film. Otherwise, move on to something more fulfilling.",1370649600,,541,4.956043956043956
4789498,3,B005LAIH2M,the story line was easy to follow although there were some confusing scenes.  it you miss any part of the story you will not be able to follow the script since the movie is nothing like the fairy tale.  Quite a few witches in the story (pretty and ugly).,1370649600,,254,4.163265306122449
4789499,3,B005LAIH2M,It was alright. Ok to watch if you work nightshift and are off a night and can't sleep. Renner is unfortunately for Gun Control and against the 2nd Amendment.,1370649600,,158,4.482758620689655
4789500,5,B005LAIH2M,"I'm shocked at how much I like this movie! I've watched it twice in one day and I'll probably watch it again soon. The premise is wonderful and the acting is great. The writing is crisp, clean and moves the story along beautifully. I don't know if there is a sequel to this story that could live up to the standard this has set, but I'd give it a chance. I had a similar reaction the Snow White and the Huntsman. I think they may be on to something here. Fairy Tales for adults... now thats great Hollywood theatre!",1370649600,,515,4.212121212121212
4789501,2,B005LAIH2M,Well it's sorta gory. Can be amusing in parts but its missing a lot. Like a script. Acting  a clue. Really bad. Save your money. I love horror movies. Unfortunately the trend has been to many special effects and to little sense,1370563200,,227,4.404761904761905
4789502,5,B005LAIH2M,"So obviously the reason I went to go see this movie in the first place was because of Jeremy Renner. He's one of my favorite actors. Gemma is amazing too. Well I saw previews for the movie and it looked really good. I'm an action junky, so figured it would be perfect for me, and man was I right. I hate seeing all the negative reviews about it. Yes, it's not like the fairy tale, but that didn't bother me. I just love how bad ass they turned out after everything they had been through. Plus, getting to see Jeremy shirtless was a plus. If you're a fan of guts, gore, and action, this is the movie for you. Don't listen to all the nay sayers...this movie is a must see!",1370476800,8,670,4.122137404580153

4789537,3,B005LAIH2M,"A fun action/adventure with a fairy tale twist. The protagonists deliver a believable brother-sister act that specializes in whacking witches.

Wouldn't be surprised if there's a follow-up, but if not I won't miss it.",1370390400,,371,5.0

4789541,1,B005LAIH2M,"I had such high hopes going into this movie. A Solid cast of actors and no PG rating attached so it was definitely geared towards the adult audience. The opening scene I will admit had me interested as it sets the premise as to the goal evil witches works towards throughout the movie.

But the minute I saw one of the evil sycophants that follow Famke Jensen (the villian) around I knew things were going to go down hill. The minute he spewed forth his dialogue, the movie's downhill slide picked up momentum. But when Hansel and Gretel actually CAPTURE this spike-headed idiot (and an evil witch to boot), do they kill him? Nope, just throw him in jail so he can be rescued later...momentum close to reaching terminal velocity for this movie...

THEN...SPOILER ALERT!

The total goal of the evil witches is to create an immunity to fire...for all witches. This would render them pretty much indestructible. Normal weapons are ineffective against the power of their wands so an immunity to fire sounds good, right?

Well, the thing that absolutely KILLED this movie is what amounts to a massive plot hole. In the movie's third act, Hansel is given the means to enchant normal weapons with a specially brewed potion. The weapons will bypass a witch's wand. HELLO!!!! Screw fire people, just start giving out this potion to every single town in the area and let the town people kill the witches whenever they come to terrorize them. And THAT right there killed this movie...

One other point, in the final battle, Gretel has an AWESOME chain whip (treated with the potion of course). If this weapon had been used throughout the movie, I would have added another star because it's use was awesome in the only scene it is shown.",1370217600,3,1725,4.698675496688741

4789546,4,B005LAIH2M,"Was surprised by how much I liked it ... particularly considering all the negative reviews this movie has been hit with.

Thing is, I don't EXPECT much when starting to watch a film called HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS; no eloquent writing, no intense plot, and certainly not a whole lot of character development. Nope.  I would expect action, CGI (perhaps some cheesy CGI), larger-than-life characters, and a plot that might occasionally make me laugh with what it expects its audience to believe.  When I go to Burger King, I don't expect a steak.

And THAT is what I got! Much like 'Van Helsing' (which I also sort of liked, sorry), this film is a lot of craziness, dramatic acting, overblown violence/gore ... and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. Hansel & Gretel, since successfully burning the witch who was going to eat them as children, have in the years since become professional witch hunters who routinely eradicate villages of their local hags ... for a price. They meet their match, however, when paid to help a village - most of the residents of which hate them for, they feel, drawing witches and death to their village in the first place - and instead come across one powerful grand-witch (Famke Janssen) with plans of her own for the brother/sister pair. Lots of blood, cool weaponry, dismemberment, sarcastic remarks, and both awesome and lame CGI makes for a goulash of insanity that - yeah - I still liked a lot.

The film in NO WAY takes itself seriously; do yourself a favor and approach it the same way.  It's popcorn for the mind, and pretends to be nothing more.",1370044800,73,1585,4.703971119133574

Bad:  Plot a little weak but who cares.

One does wonder how this stuff gets made.  I'm sure that it sounded good in the pitch.  But the story is utterly lacking.  There is no character development, no arc of change to make them interesting.  A gory rehash of concepts that were dredged from other movies.  The effects are shiny and well executed... but, so what!  Who cares if there isn't a story.  Both of the main actors plod through this like they're on morphine... (or wish they were.)  Why?!  Because there is nothing for them to act with.  The dialog is banal.  The action is derivative.  The direction is uninspired.

Hansel even has diabetes because the witch made him eat so much candy when he was a little boy. One of my favorite scenes is in the beginning where they get revenge on the witch that had planned to eat them and throw her in her own oven to burn to death and little 'Gretel' says ""Hot enough for you now, b***h!?"".
This may have not been a summer blockbuster but it's a very good time waster. Buy it from the digital Amazon sight and you'll enjoy every minute of it, especially when Famke Jansen makes her debut in the film as the most powerful witch around.",1369699200,4,817,4.381578947368421

It was cool to see witches flying around on brooms and the character named Edward was a nice touch.  I'm big on the fairy tale stuff and found this to be one to buy on 3D, BD.

4789913,3,B005LAIH2M,"I was really anticipating this movie. But when I saw it, I observed the following: it very definitely looked like the quality you see in ""made for TV"" movies. (Which figures since it is an MTV production). I could not stop thinking Hansel was being played by actor Rob Schneider. They could be brothers. The movie seems to be an accurately rendered amalgam of other movies: A lot of Van Helsing, Princess Bride, Hulk, Beauty and the Beast, Sleepy Hollow, The Matrix, a huge amount of Twilight, and the Labyrinth, to name a few....Hansel seriously cannot hold onto his gun. He drops his firearm at LEAST twenty times. I am not kidding. Gretel can take a punch, agreed, up to a point at which time she crumples, which seems like her role in the majority of the film.
With all she has to pull together in her busy schedule, the bad guy spends the whole movie walking SO slowly, showing nothing but dry amusement as she beats on the protagonists, if she would only run, she would be more successful, quicker, however, the overconfident ""walking bad guy"" is a common cinematic. It's considerably overdone in this picture.
I think the best example of what I am referring to when I mention a made for TV feeling, is a dungeon scene with reasonably dungeon like effects including stone walls and such, however there is not a speck of dust, nor cobweb, nor really anything macabre in the dungeon. It's a dustless, clean dungeon in a shambles. Most ""scenes"" are obviously ""sets"" with the most conspicuous aspects being a painfully flat and level floor and a lack of actual detail at the periphery of several sets. Budget? You might also notice a fairly evident amount of green screen work, which is in all films these days but not quite as obviously.
Too many inconsistencies to describe, a single example is a witch who can literally punch chunks out of trees but doesn't take off the protagonists' heads with a pretty decent direct hit. The troll is a 'made for TV' costume and special effect in the extreme. An enormous rubber head with two enormous rubber paws and two huge burlap bags for feet on nothing more than a normal human frame. Disappointing.
Let's not ruin the film for the 10-17 year old crowd. In general, if there are witches being killed by cocky-and-often-effective protagonists in black trench coats, things like a cohesisve plot are secondary concerns. At other times and for an older crowd, you look at your watch waiting for the plot to come back together. The language is nothing new, but too many F bombs for some younger kids. All in all an enjoyable picture, but I would recommend waiting til it's down in price on DVD or rentable for just a few bucks.",1369440000,2,2670,4.635021097046414

It had medieval gadgetry including a fully automatic spear tip thrower. I felt like this was a Riding Hood companion film, just not as good in spite of Gemma's cleavage.

As famous witch hunters, H&G have their own groupies. They are hired by the mayor because of a rash of child disappearances, which we quickly find out is for a special ceremony. The dialouge was so-so. I couldn't help think of a line from LOTR when Hansel says, ""Evil is upon you if you like it or not."" Indeed much of the script feels like it is borrowed and written for tweens. The witches in this film are very powerful. They travel through the woods at speeds which look like ""Twilight"" vampires.

It is great fun and what you expect. It starts with the classic Grimms Fairy Tale Story and Oh My God the Wicked Witch in the gingerbread and candy house is one of the most creepy, chilling and scarey witches I have ever seen on film. She will scare the Hell out of you and make you jump with fear! As you know Hansel and Gretel barely escape with their lives after pushing the witch into a firey death. As they grow up they then become witch hunters who go around the country side saving children from other hags intent on killing and eating youngsters. The look and feel of the movie is the same as if you were living back then some 200 years ago when the story takes place like the classic tale. This film has it all, horror, action and comedy and moves fast from beginning to end and never a dull moment! It will make you jump, scream, laugh and have your jaw drop open with disbelief with what you just saw on the screen. The Wicked Witches are Scarey, Chilling and indeed Creepy!!  The cannibal crones attack like the living dead hungry for flesh and blood of the innocent. Some of them even fly on broom stick like tree branches trying to escape the wrath of adult Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. The witches are the classic fairy tale type and what you hope and expect from a rated R Horror/Action/Comedy Hansel and Gretel movie for adults!! I am going to buy this on DVD as soon as it is released and this is one of those movies that you will enjoy watching over and over again and even sharing with your friends too. Don't listen to any of the negative comments about this movie from others.

A great action and fun movie. With funny new ideas, a familar background story, few dramatic scenes and bloody horror. Also the music is great.

Jeremy Renner as Hansel (in Germany Hnsel!) and Gemma Arterton as Gretel are absolutly great. They bring the action, fun and the dramatic very good on the screen. That make it to a great movie as a new version from the old fairy-tale story of Hansel&Gretel.

The new ideas in this story are great and make it funny too. And it has the potential to a second movie, i hope it soo.

4790269,2,B005LAIH2M,"What does the story of Hansel and Gretel teach us? That evil witches who have a taste for children will, one day, get their comeuppance. And don't eat houses made out of candy. That one is pretty important. But have you ever wondered if this is where their story really ends? I have and this is Part 2. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are all grown up now but they've never forgotten their harrowing experience as children. After defeating the witch with a hunger for young flesh, they've made it their life's mission to eradicate the world of these vile creatures. Only things aren't quite as simple as they seem. Hansel and Gretel have gone from being the hunters to being the hunted. And now they face a greater evil (Famke Janssen) that will force them to confront their painful past.

Retribution is the name of the game in Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Ya know, I find it pretty ironic that retribution is one of the many things this movie failed to achieve. Grimm's Hansel and Gretel would be ashamed, because, let's face it--- it was all sorts of bad. I kinda already knew that going in though. The way I saw it, was Hansel & Gretel had all the potential to be one of those ""awesomely bad"" films I'm constantly raving about. And that, folks, is why I took a chance on it. Unfortunately, such was not the case. My wallet and the hour and half I spent at the theatre are still suffering from severe pangs of regret. I'm sorry, guys. I wish I could blame my justification on illness but any excuse I come up with is flimsy, at best. I just... I don't even know anymore. This movie was far beyond disfunctional and no amount of Jeremy Renner hotness could salvage it from being such a mess.

As much as I disliked the movie, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters does have intermittent moments of satisfaction however far and few between they may be. The story has potential. It really does. I like the whole fairy tale/vigilante justice thing. My main problem was that it felt like they weren't even trying when it came to the actual execution. It's like, Hollywood just shoved piles of money at the producers and said, ""Here you go, give me bucket loads of CGI. Nothing more, nothing less. Story? The public doesn't give a damn about story. They want blood! And guts! And lots of it!"" Hansel & Gretel settles for being over-the-top with the amount violence and gore it presents. And don't get me wrong, the violence and gore is what kept it interesting for me. You will never see a better decapitation scene in a movie, I guarantee it. It's just unfortunate because SFX isn't enough to solely keep this movie-goer wholly entertained.

Hansel & Gretel lacks decent dialogue, coherency and likeable characters which is surprising considering the talents they cast in the film. Renner and Arterton are both wooden in their delivery and just look uncomfortable, in general. The movie was relentless and unforgiving, killing off just about everyone, including the only likeable character. If Wirkola was smart, he could've made the film into a clever trope but instead it goes beyond spoofy and lands somewhere in the realm of cartoonish which is, quite possibly, the worst fate to befall an action film.

Food for Thought: Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is another film full of potential that was flushed down the toilet. It lacks both the oomph and fun that's assumed by watching the trailer. You go in expecting that it's going to be bad, just not quite that bad. While there were some gratifying death scenes and the all-asstastic Jeremy Renner, neither saves the movie from flopdom.

4790273,3,B005LAIH2M,"Leather. Gore. Anachronistic steampunk weapons. Snarling witches. And a pair of classic fairy-tale characters who have become witch-hunting bounty hunters.

If that doesn't tip you off that this isn't a very serious movie, then maybe the title will: ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters."" Tommy Wirkola's first big Hollywood movie is strictly the kind of action-packed popcorn-for-the-brain that is fun to watch, as long as you don't take it too seriously. The biggest problem is that the movie never quite figures out if it's a tongue-in-cheek action movie or a dark comedy.

Once upon a time, Hansel and Gretel were abandoned in the woods by their parents, and ended up wandering over to a house made of candy. You know how the story goes -- there's a witch inside, she wants to eat Hansel, Gretel saves the day, and the witch is burned alive.

Happily ever after? Well, not exactly. Fifteen years later, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are leather-clad weapon-toting bounty hunters who specialize in witches, especially since spells don't affect them. The mayor of a small town hires them when children go missing, despite the meddling of the psychotic local sheriff and his band of goons.

After catching and offing a local witch, Hansel and Gretel discover that the witches are planning a massive sacrifice during a forthcoming Blood Moon. Even worse, the witches are led by a Grand Witch named Muriel (Famke Jansson) who knows the secrets of the siblings' past, and the true reason their parents abandoned them. Defeating her and her followers might be more than even Hansel and Gretel can handle.

My biggest problem with ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is that it never quite makes up its mind what it wants to be -- it's too serious to be a dark comedy, but still too tongue-in-cheek to be a straight action movie. It vacillates between the two extremes constantly. But either way, it's a fun brainless movie, with buckets of gore and anachronistic weapons (Hansel's love-interest Mina blasts witches with a FRICKING GATLING GUN!).

So if you expect a mindless, tongue-in-cheek gorefest, this movie will probably fit the bill. Is it a great movie? Not really. Is it fun? Yeah!  It's not even trying to be ""authentic,"" so it succeeds wildly.

Wirkola is pretty obviously reveling in the ability to create a ""dark fairy tale"" with a firm R-rating. It could have used some subplot-pruning (Thomas Mann's ""fanboy"" character is just distracting), but the central tale is a pretty straightforward one. The fun comes from the one-liners (""I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket""), the B-movie stunts and sets, and the gore. Did I mention the gore? Because there's a lot of it, and it's fun.

Wirkola also seems to enjoy showing Renner and Arterton getting beaten up, because nearly every scene with ANY action involves them getting slammed into rocks, knocked senseless, and occasionally stabbed. The Grimm siblings certainly earn their money.

Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton honestly couldn't look any LESS like siblings, but both look like they're having a blast as leather-clad, cussing bounty hunters who constantly wave around absurd weapons (Hansel's hilariously phallic gun). They are perfectly suited to the dry, tongue-in-cheek approach of the script, and they even get some interesting character twists, such as Hansel suffering from diabetes because of his all-candy diet as a child.

""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is by no means a great film, but it is a resolutely fun one -- lots of splattered body parts, screeching witches and gleeful anachronisms. Turn off your brain and enjoy.",1362355200,4,3652,5.029801324503311

What sort of numb skulls believe it`s ok to introduce 21st century technology into a Grimms tale? There must have been a real absence of good ideas to make this story work on it`s own.
The movie is packed with all sorts of great action and special effects. The story and acting is good, but the whole character of the original tale is distroyed by the unneccesary introduction of 21st century gagets. Saddened and ruined the experience for me. I'm enormously dissapointed by this movie.",1361664000,4,543,4.608247422680412
4790319,1,B005LAIH2M,"Ever wonder what happened to Hansel and Gretel after they burned the witch?  They became world renowned witch hunters and child rescuers.  But somewhere along the line they must have gone into a time-warp to 21st century Hollywood where they lost their German accents, and their rustic innocence and learned how to become Hollywood hipsters who traded in their peasant clothing for designer leather pants and jackets.  It was amazing how a little peasant girl was transformed into Hollywood hottie Gretel with the  big attitude and the potty mouth that goes along with it.  Watching her strut around with the crossbow was like watching a clone of Angelina Jolie's character, Salt, only with the Black Forest of medieval Germany as a backdrop.

The main part of the movie begins when hottie Gretel and hunky Hansel strut into a dirty, run-down village which is being plagued by witches.  They encounter the sheriff who is the stereotypical anal authority figure that can be found in all of these type of movies.  The bumbling sheriff and the stereotypical white-trash townfolk are about to kill a suspected witch when Gretel sticks a multi-barelled he-man gun against his neck and threatens to blow his brains out all over these ""f-ing hillbillies"".  She then breaks his nose with a head-butt.  From that moment on, I was rooting for the witches.  The hipsters make it clear to these cretinous, dim-witted hillbillies that if they want to save their children, we're in charge, you should be grateful, and stay out of our way.

There are alot of high-tech, special effect action scenes, but there is not much of a plot to this story and the acting is atrocious.  Actually, it was comical to see thousand year old kung fu, ninja witches who looked like prunes with rotten teeth doing flying, leaping twirling kicks and backflips that would have made Bruce Lee look like a geriatric.  Then they hop on a broom that can go mach 3 through the Black Forest without hitting any branches.  Although the witches prove to be formidable opponents, they are no match for hottie Gretel and hunky Hansel who are ninja warriors in their own right armed with gattling guns, fully automatic crossbows and the latest medieval weaponry a bag of gold can buy.  (They must have learned their martial arts skills  during their time warp in Hollywood.)

Of course we must be sensitive to the fact that it was their abandonement by their parents which gave them a complex and made them neurotic over-achievers.  In one supposedly touching scene we learn the truth about why their parents had to abandon them.  However, the hero and heroine of this movie are a couple of nauseatingly narcissistic and arrogant characters that the rest of us mere mortals will never be able to identify ourselves with.  If you have an IQ above the level of a turnip, take a pass on this one.  It is another cornball action flick.  If it were any more cornball, it could have been a great Mel Brooks type spoof.

Walt Disney did justice to the folktales of The Brothers Grimm.  If they could see this thing they'd be rolling in their graves.",1361577600,16,3096,4.774436090225564
4790320,5,B005LAIH2M,"Some might call this movie ridiculous, while others will say they hate this movie. I however will take a different approach and say this movie IS A  Really good movie!!! It reminds me  of why I still like the movie Zombieland  to this day; not because its an oscar worthy film or the storyline is the best there is, but because this movie is a hell of a lot of fun!! I was a bit suprised going in to the movie that it was rated R but if you get the opportunity to see the film you will understand why. This is not just a fairy tale anymore. Gemma Arterton was great (and very Beautiful i might add) as Gretel although i personally really enjoyed the take on Jeremy Renner's character Hansel. Storyline wise it is actually really enjoyable and the action is over the top. If you want to have a good time and are not expecting to watch A (oscar nominated movie), then look no further than Hansel And Gretel Witch Hunters

However, this movie was far from being about bread crumbs!  It is a great movie, very action packed, and bloody.  It has a very good twist in it and is well worth watching!",1361404800,3,335,3.955223880597015

4790323,5,B005LAIH2M,"Let's start off by clearing the air a little bit: if you are looking for the next best picture nod and/or the next great fantasy epic, this is not it (and, quite frankly, I'm curious as to why you thought this one WOULD be it). If, however, you can enjoy movies without deep character development or scenes of life-changing consequence, then this is a movie that I highly recommend. I can unequivocally state that this movie did not make me re-evaluate my life, nor did I shed a single tear over, well, anything in this movie due to its emotional narrative...but it was so much fun! I'm someone who can watch best picture movies that stretch your brain and emotions and enjoy them intensely - I am also someone who can fall in love with a movie simply designed to entertain, and, well, I fell in love with this one. I felt that each character was played correctly and hit the tones they were supposed to. There was plenty of action and - contrary to popular opinion - there WAS a plot. I went to the movies expecting to see a flick that would entertain me and I got exactly what I paid for - in fact, it was one of the most satisfying movies I'd ever watched simply for what I was expecting and what I got out of it. Also, for an R-rated movie, there was a lot less stuff than I was expecting. I mean, there IS stuff in it - it is R-rated, for heaven's sake - but it was a lot better than I'd thought, which was great. I can only think of one or two things story-wise that irked me to the point where I wanted someone to have corrected them, but I'll leave them for you to figure out :) I gave it 5 stars not because it was a perfectly made movie, but because I wanted to see it again after watching it...and I don't always feel that way about movies that ARE flawlessly made. Rent the movie if you don't trust me enough to see it in theaters, but I think you'll find it an enjoyable 1 1/2 hours.",1361318400,270,1896,4.154891304347826

I Love the paranormal spin on this classic tale, Famke Janssen (Jean Grey-X-men) was amazing as the main witch and evil as Hell itself too. Her performance was awesome.. Jeremy Renner as Hansel YUM (Hawkeye-The Avengers) Oh my he made an excellent Hansel... bringing the brain and the bronze together. Gemma Arterton as Gretel (Tamina-The Price of Persia) was spectacular, bringing grace and beauty.
I absolutely Loved and Enjoyed this movie.. will definitely be purchasing the DVD...

4790387,4,B005LAIH2M,"Of the three recent H&G films, this one is certainly the best. I enjoyed the film up until I understood what was happening, and at that point the film makers couldn't bring it home. The movie looked like it was shot on the same set of ""Red Riding Hood."" It had medieval gadgetry including a fully automatic spear tip thrower. I felt like this was a Riding Hood companion film, just not as good in spite of Gemma's cleavage.

As famous witch hunters, H&G have their own groupies. They are hired by the mayor because of a rash of child disappearances, which we quickly find out is for a special ceremony. The dialouge was so-so. I couldn't help think of a line from LOTR when Hansel says, ""Evil is upon you if you like it or not."" Indeed much of the script feels like it is borrowed and written for tweens. The witches in this film are very powerful. They travel through the woods at speeds which look like ""Twilight"" vampires. A film for teens.

4790388,2,B005LAIH2M,"""Too many hands in the pot spoil the soup"". This seems to apply to this movie with so many producers that there was no control.

Instead, they chose to turn the Grimm Brothers' story into a _needlessly_ blood-and-guts covered film (adding little if anything to the story...) evoking the worst of The Matrix / Quentin Tarantino films (where even the Matrix and more recent Tarantino films employed their violence/more graphic imagery for a purpose).

4790392,3,B005LAIH2M,"I saw Hansel and Gretel the day it came out because let's face it Gemma Atherton is beautiful and Jeremy Renner kicks all kinds of ass. Despite those two really big positives I went into watching it with very low expectations, I've just seen too many horror comedies over the years to not remember that they often don't work. First and foremost this film is fun to watch, but for me it seemed really unbalanced and never really got into a good rhythm because it jumped back and forth from irreverent horror comedy to action adventure to action horror with no rhyme or reason. This led to the fact that this film has a lot of scenes I liked, but the overall story to me seemed slow in developing because I just wasn't that involved in the characters lives. The film however does have a truly beautiful production design and from the make up effects of the witches to the strange almost steampunk inspired fire arms you can really see the money that was sunk into the film. I have seen a few people compare this film to Van Hielsing and while that comparison is fair this film takes itself far less seriously and is a great deal more fun to watch.

I would only rent this one, it's fun to watch the first time, but I doubt you will want to have it in your collection for repeat viewings.",1359676800,3,1285,4.354166666666667
4790393,4,B005LAIH2M,"What's good: Gemma in skin-tights, great effects, more than passable action sequences.
What's not: Anachronistic and/or overly-elaborate weapons - but this was fantasy, right?

The script certainly keeps things moving. We have all the right tensions between all the right characters (like sheriff vs. free-lancers, unexpected kind of witch). It starts with a familiar fairy tale, but doesn't try to change it (or not much). Instead, it adds new chapters at the end, and posits a bit of back-story before the traditional plot gets under way.

Popcorn-worthy, but I probably won't remember details a week from now.
