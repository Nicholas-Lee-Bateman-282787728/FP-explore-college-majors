8204595,3,B000S6VFOG,"I was somewhat disappointed in that it wasn't really and ""instructional"" video.  It simply had Mr. Shelton and Mr. shuffler demonstrate the way they pick--and, pick, they did!  They are superb guitarists.  The material was too advanced for me to sort through and learn on my own.  One who expects to learn the skills represented in the video and booklet must be adept in alternate picking and should be skilled in reading and interpreting tablature--I am not to that point, which is probably why I fell short in this course.  I would recommend this series for students of the guitar who are at least at the advanced intermediate level.  This critique should in no way be interpreted as taking anything away from these two performers' guitar skills.  They are among the best.",1409184000,,774,4.818181818181818
8204596,5,B000S6VFOG,"This is without any doubt, the very best instruction device for learning cross picking on the guitar.
Both Allen Shelton and George Shuffler do a fine job of playing, and explaining, exactly what they are doing.
I highly recommend this instructional video DVD.",1375660800,3,260,5.069767441860465
