2774006,5,B000NOIX66,"They truly don't make 'em like they used to, and this classic series, that lasted eight seasons was one of the most consistently entertaining series ever. Great acting, great plots and surprising twists, edge-of-the-seat gripping tension. The first season was great, but the second season and beyond, with the addition of Peter Graves and the seasoning of the entire creative and production team made for some absolutely perfect and unbeatable video entertainment!

Best of all, these releases cost a little more than a dollar an hour of viewing. Petty hard to beat!!!!",1176595200,17,569,5.184782608695652
2774007,5,B000NOIX66,"Mission Impossible - The Second TV Season begins where most of our memories remain of the show. The first season featured Steven Hill, best known for being the NY DA in Law and Order, as the head of the Impossible Missions Force. But Hill left the hit show and was succeeded by Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, the leader most of us grew up watching.

The show continued with its great guest stars, sometimes complicated plots, and skillful use of the ""con the bad guys"" approach that was the hallmark of the series. Graves came in and fit seamlessly at the same time his brother James Arness was continuing his long run as Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke.

This show will always be treasured for its pioneering plot devices and its challenge to the viewer to keep up with what was going on. It's great that this series is finally on DVD.",1175472000,32,825,4.456953642384106

2774010,5,B000NOIX66,"With this second season of Mission: Impossible we see Peter Graves

introduced as head of the Impossible Missions Force, in the role

of Jim Phelps, replacing Steven Hill as Dan Briggs.  The Dan Briggs

character is more cerebral, the Jim Phelps character is more physical.

Both characters have their supporters, although I tend  to prefer

Jim Phelps.  It is noteworthy that I don't believe there is any

other television series that could replace its lead actor and not

have it affect the shows quality or popularity. This is because

MI is ""plot driven"" rather than ""character driven"". Indeed, two more

central characters would leave after season 3 (Rollin and Cinammon) and

yet the series would go on for several more seasons, indicating

the outstanding quality of the plots, direction and production.

In general, I feel the overall quality of the series improved in the

second and third seasons.  There are episodes in the first season that

are as good as any ever produced (e.g. Operation Rogosz, The Carriers,

The Frame as well as the pilot episode), but there were a good number

of weaker stories.  The second season sees an overall stronger effort.

Whereas the first season still has some 1960's-staple car chases, shootouts and fist fights, these pretty much disappear in the second season and the emphasis is on outwitting the enemy with clever plots and ingenious gadgets.  Especially noteworthy is ""Trial By Fury"" which is an especially intense

story, masterfully directed by Leonard J Horn who also did the equally intense ""Operation

Rogosz"", ""The Photographer"" with a great performance by Anthony Zerbe who plays the son of a convicted atomic scientist out for revenge, and an unusual episode called ""The Town"" where Jim is drugged and held prisoner

by an evil enemy agent played by the otherwise grandfatherly Will Geer.

Seeing masterpiece television series like this made 40 years ago can only make us lament the dismal state of the art today.",1174348800,26,1975,5.015432098765432
2774011,5,B000NOIX66,I am soooooooooo glad that they finally released this series on DVD. I loved it when I was a kid growing up. I hope that they release the entire series and even the one that they did in the 80's. Love the crew of this show. What more can you say.,1174262400,6,246,3.843137254901961
2774012,5,B000NOIX66,"This series was on the air before I was born.  I discovered the brief re-relese of the series in the late 80's which starred Peter Graves and Phil Morris (son of Greg Morris from the original series).  My folks let me know that the series was a remake of an original which I was unable to find at the time.

A few years later a local station started replaying the original series and I was hooked!  In fact I convinved my wife to check out a couple episodes and she was hooked as well.  For over a year we recorded the episodes to VHS with commercials and bad audio.  We recently had to toss a dozen tapes because the quality had gotten so bad.  I suprised my wife with season one on DVD a few weeks ago and we enjoy watching an episode every night.

The show has some great sets, smart plots, and fun music.  I'm VERY happy to see the second season out.  I hope this means that the whole series is forthcoming! You don't have to ""remember"" this show to want to get the series.  Check it out!",1174003200,4,992,4.141361256544503
2774013,5,B000NOIX66,"After waiting years for the 'Real' Mission:Impossible to be released on dvd, we are now expecting the release of season 2, in June, with the more familiar Jim Phelps, as head of the IMF. Season 1 was great, but I'm looking forward to seasons 2 thru 7, to be even better. If you think the movies were what Mission:Impossible was all about, you ain't seen nothin' yet. ""Your mission should you decide to accept it, is to go out and purchase the Mission:Impossible tv collection, and enjoy the 'Real' thing. As always should you, or any other Mission:Impossible fan fail to do so, you must have been shot, killed, or off on a 'Cruise'.

2774014,5,B000NOIX66,"After geting season one, I could not wait for the release of season 2.  The first season dvd were better than expected with great transfers of both picture and sound.  The stories, of course were even better than I remembered.  This is Mission Impossible, not the movies of recent times.  These episodes are based on outwitting, fooling or even conning the opposition not outmuscling them.  These agents use planning and stealth to achieve the mission.  Of course, something will go wrong calling for improvisation and adaptation.  This season marks the appearance of Peter Graves as Jim Phelps.  He has a warmer screen personna than Steven Hill of the first season.  These shows hold their own even after forty years.  From the first note of the opening theme, you will be hooked.  Action, humor and suspense delivered with great acting and writing.  Do not let this set self destruct.  Do not disavow this series.  It is an all time classic.",1172880000,126,943,4.849056603773585

2774050,5,B000NOIX66,"This season sees the departure of Steven Hill's ""Daniel Briggs"" as team leader and the start of Peter Graves' ""Jim Phelps"". In the series you can see that the movies Tom Cruise makes, while very entertaining, don't capture the essence of the concept: this is a team of grifters who run cons, long and short, on enemies of the mysterious ""Secretary"". Each begins with a mission, delivered by the calm voice of Walker Edmiston, after which Phelps decides who he'll need, as the wheels turn in his head forming his con. Spoiler: it's always the same core, but at this point in the series they didn't mind the occasional specialist. The enjoyment is watching the con unfold, and watching the team recover from the occasional perturbation.

The combination of Jim, Rollin, Barney, Willy, and the ever classy Cinnamon works much better than the previous season with Dan Briggs.  At least on camera, the cast seem to get along quite well, almost feeding off each other's talents.  Unlike later seasons, they always seemed to wrap up each episode with in a coherent fashion.  The last two seasons in particular always seemed to just end with them revealing their identities to the targets.

2774395,5,B000NOIX66,"Mission Impossible was a fantastic series with all of the high production qualities of Desilu Studios. Not only does it have one of the most iconic theme songs in TV history but all of the sound track work is top notch. Peter Graves as 'Jim Phelps'  has replaced Steven Hill's 'Dan Briggs' as the leading man who accepts and organizes the missions so it has a little different energy than season one but this line up is considered to be THE best it was.  I can watch these episodes over and over and if you are a fan of the original Star Trek (also a Desilu production) then you will recognise a lot of the character actors and guest stars as they were being made at the same time on the Desilu lot.

Peter Lupus was a regular as well but always seemed to have a background role. The original theme by Lalo Schifrin is classic and immediately recognizable - and the opening segment of clips under the fuse burning down motif is excellent.",1454198400,,569,4.428571428571429

The clothing styles, all the smoking, the cars, the references to political events, great going back in time.  Good quality and no commercials.",1444867200,,249,4.744186046511628
2774646,5,B000NOIX66,"This was a series I watched as a child and was amazing what they could do like holograms and other things that we can actually do today or could it be done then is the question.  If I remember correctly this showed on Sunday nights and at about 9 pm I think and being the responsible first child I was allowed to stay up and watch it.  They say that TV influences children and the blood and guts as well as stabbing and really bad valance I agree there are ages and limits but this was basically a well calculated and thinking series that I feel was good for growing up, was in the late 1960's and only a few decades since the World War had ended.  Blind then and people are blind today and this series is something that I feel really was going on then and is going on now and that is spies, corruption and blindness of people in all countries  Nice blast from the past and amazing that they had like 26 episodes every year and like 8 seasons so today that would be equal to about 18 years.",1444867200,2,990,4.1139896373057

2774650,4,B000NOIX66,"While the special effects cannot compare with those of today, this series takes me back to my childhood when I could hardly wait for the series every week on TV. In the 1960s, this was great stuff. It is no wonder a series of MI movies have appeared in recent years. While we are no longer fighting the Cold War or Latin American dictators, there are still plenty of reasons to like MI today. Peter Graves was a nice addition to the IMF in season 2.",1444435200,,449,4.232558139534884

I'm totally chuffed to see the series come back to Amazon Prime; the devious plotting, remarkable actorly range of the entire cast, and unforgettable music maintain this show's status as one of the great celebrations of the art of the long con.  Season 2 is the first season with Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, the leader of the IM Force, and has the husband-and-wife team of Martin Landau as Rollin' Hand and Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter.

It was a series about the job and not the people.  You really end up knowing next to nothing about any of the people on the team.  They're all just cogs in the machine.  This makes some sense if you have a super secret agency where the supervisors are picking them out and using them.

Good price for this much content.  The episodes aren't all good, what season of any series can claim that usually, but I enjoyed watching them all.  I picked up season 3 already so looking forward to that.  I think the ones I saw as a kid were pretty much exclusively out of this or the next season because I didn't recognize the supervisor who was in season 1 and I understand that Roland Hand and Cinnamon Carter are gone in season 4.",1426896000,5,878,4.178571428571429
2774835,4,B000NOIX66,"First year with Peter Graves as Mr. Phelps (2nd year for the series.)  This is the Mission Impossible those of us who watched it back in the 60's and 70's remember.  These are not as high-tech as the newer Tom Cruise versions, but remember, this was back in the late 60's, before personal computers and cell phones and special effects (although the tape/ record he hears the proposal on automatically being destroyed at the beginning was pretty advanced for the time.)

If there is a drawback to this season, it is that they went with the stock team every episode.  In the first season, they had more guest stars as part of the MI team, and made for a more diverse cast and story.

Also, unlike the DVD releases of current shows, there are no extra features or behind the scenes content to watch.",1426896000,,796,4.5

2774856,5,B000NOIX66,"I consider this to be one of the best - if not the best - Television Show ever! At the time, it was extremely innovative: That collage that flashed at the beginning was a completely new idea. Plus, at the beginning the characters would go through the gadgets they were planning to use which also got up our curiosity. Not to forget the ""Good Morning Mr. Phelps"" and the recording would outline a situation/problem that the audience would wonder how in the world the team would ever pull off resolving. The show was hitting its stride in the 2nd year.  I think Peter Graves did a terrific job as Mr. Phelps, tall, blonde and handsome-and a fine actor.  Barbara Bain and Martin Landau were still with the show.  I consider Miss Bain a Class Act, she brought something elegant to the show.  Her husband was also a terrific actor, he could, at times, give you the feeling that he was having fun.

Jim Phelps leads this team.  Jim is not a traitor.  Nobody named Ethan Hunt is ever in this series (thank goodness).  It is a Desilu production and had a small budget (like Star Trek) but they still put out a good show.

Of course, most people only know of ""Jim Phelps"" as the team leader but it took me a long time during the original running of the series to get use to Peter Graves playing Jim Phelps, since I had seen Steven Hill play Dan Briggs who was the original team leader.

Mission: Impossible is what backlot productions made the Golden age TV so golden. When DesiLu productions used movie contact players of Paramount along with the use of their studio backlot they came up with a quality series. Mission always used international topics to base their storylines. The 60's Cold War and the South American Drug Cartel kept the team as popular, with the viewers then, as the CSI teams are today.
Now these five would meet the challenge episode after episode with less high tech gadgets at work than the present day Silver Sceen version. Quality performances even in rerun.",1390176000,,681,4.982456140350878

2774977,4,B000NOIX66,"Riding the popularity of the ""spy craze"" Mission Impossible had a successful debut on CBS in 1966.  Receiving their assignments via recorded messages, the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) executed devious and elaborately planned schemes, completing clandestine operations too difficult or sensitive for the US government to undertake.

While Mission Impossible was a success, there were issues with actor Steven Hill who played IMF leader Dan Briggs, which led his being replaced.  In season two (1967-68) Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, assumed leadership of the IMF, without any explanation, or mention of Briggs.  Fortunately, Graves had great chemistry with the rest of the cast, and helped to stabilize a difficult situation.

The IMF's core group remained the same, with master of disguise Rollin Hand (Martin Landau), cover girl Cinnamon Carter (Barbara Bain), electronics expert Barney Collier (Greg Morris), and strong man Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus).  Additional agents were brought in as was necessary.  With Jim Phelps, an active, attractive, charismatic, and totally committed leader, the IMF was at full strength, and prepared to take on the toughest assignments.

Mission Impossible featured intriguing situations, complicated plots, exotic locations, ingenious inventions and devices, and bold impersonations, and disguises.  There were also many stereotypical characters, and occasional instances of overacting, and some terrible accents.  If anything, some of the stories in the first season were a little too outlandish, to the point of being almost absurd.  While still quite edgy and loaded with clichs, the writing in the second season seems to be a reigned back a bit, and slightly more in touch with reality.  The impersonations and use of rubber masks, which was kind of overdone in the first season, is reduced, and there seem to be fewer abrupt cheesy endings.  No matter how outrageous the scheme may be, the IMF team always displays a serious attitude, working together like true professionals.  Since the viewer isn't clued in as to exactly what the plan is, there is usually a decent level of suspense.

The series provided interesting roles, mostly for male guest stars, and season two features many familiar faces from the era, including Albert Paulsen, Joseph Ruskin, Eric Braden, Sid Haig, Brock Peters, Anthony Zerbe, William Windom, James Daly, Darrin McGavin, Paul Winfield, Joseph Campenella, Bradford Dillman, Fritz Weaver, Will Geer, Vincent Gardenia, Gerald S. O'Loughlin, Paul Stevens, and Pernell Roberts.  Women unfortunately were not so well represented, although Antoinette Bower, Hazel Court, Joan Staley, Marianna Hill, and Kate Woodville, are among those who appear.

The image and sound quality of the episodes is generally very good.  There are some issues with focus in places, but this seems to be a conscious choice by the director.  Often set in fictional locations, the stories, which were always intended as entertainment, may not hold up that well, some forty years later.  Produced during the Cold War, and only very loosely based on reality, the program is generally an amusing and fun watch, while still serving as a reminder of those turbulent times.

With a solid cast and generally improved stories, Mission Impossible built up momentum in season two, and would peak in popularity during its third season, the last with the husband and wife team of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain.  Peter Graves, along with Greg Morris, and Peter Lupus, would become the heart of the show, remaining together until the series was cancelled in 1973.",1322956800,2,3592,5.354092526690391

All the little fingers which hold the dvd in the case were broken off.  As I say, 5 out of the 7 cases had the same problem.

As for the content the shows are great to watch again.  These earlier seasons were also written before political correctness wound up influencing the shows to become weekly missions against the mob.

My favorite episode ever is in season 2.  It's called 'The Town'.  I believe it's the only episode that did not start with the match lighting the fuse while the theme played in the background.  I'm not giving away any of the plot.  Buy it and watch it.",1271289600,3,858,4.360759493670886

Not to worry, though.  Peter (James Arness' younger brother) Graves was ready, willing, and oh, so capable as the the new, top man.
The leader changed, but not the top-notch action adventure, thrills, chills and cliff-hanging suspense that was the hallmark of this superb hourly series from Paramount Studios.
If I were to offer ANY criticism, it would be that as time went on, the formulaic, somewhat predictable this-is-where-Mr.-Phelps will-do-this aspect of the show, especially at the beginning of each episode where he went through his case with the photos.

The fear of Soviet spies or a nuclear holocaust were very real and added to the intensity of this show, especially episodes like ""The Photographer"" where the IM force creates a haunting panorama of a destroyed  landscape to, once again, psychologically fool their adversary.

Granted, by today's film standards some of these visual effects are mediocre or even poor, but again, the story lines and actors did a great job within the limits of technology and their budgets.

Even the now famous ""Mission Impossible Theme"" is so catching and perfect. However, I found it very interesting that this show, which often targeted the Soviets, slightly plagiarized that haunting melody from the Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Listen to the first movement of his Seventh Symphony and you'll here that deep pulsating bass line. Interesting.

However, this season has many episodes that I remember from my distant childhood and they did not disappoint. Therefore, despite the dated FX or extremely slow pace in some episodes, since they had to fill up an hour program, Mission Impossible was well written and was a template for many movies in the future...not to mention a school for many directors and actors.

2775014,4,B000NOIX66,"In the fall of 1967, CBS television made the decision to renew ""Mission: Impossible"". From a ratings perspective, the series hadn't exactly broken records. What the show did have in it's favour was positive reviews from critics, not to mention acclaim - the series walked away with the Emmy for Outstanding Dramatic Series in it's first season. There were however changes.

Steven Hill (who played Dan Briggs - head of the IMF team) during the first year was let go. According to backstage reports, Hill's behaviour and requests (which included leaving the set early on Friday nights to attend mass - Hill being an Orthodox Jew) were becoming increasingly difficult for the show's producers to accommodate. Moreover, there was pressure coming from the network for a more ""visible"" (ie: traditional) leading man who could anchor the series.

Enter Peter Graves as the new leader of the IMF team, Jim Phelps. Graves was an ideal choice and remains to this day the most identifiable person connected with the series. Tall and commanding, Phelps was smart and heroic. He led the team with purpose and confidence as opposed to the ""blend-in-with-the-background"" persona favoured by his predecessor. Graves also proved to be a hit with viewers as well.

Also returning were Martin Landau (having being bumped up to series regular) as Rollin Hand - man of a thousand faces. Barbara Bain as the sultry Cinnamon Carter. Greg Morris as gadget's wizard Barney Collier and Peter Lupus as the team's muscle Willy Armitage.

This season would see the show's writers begin to bring the series into sharper focus. The stories themselves would contain the same level of tension and suspense whilst at the same time, increasing the stakes. From outwitting enemy agents (""The Survivors"", ""The Photographer"" & ""The Spy"") to bringing ruthless people to justice (""Sweet Charity"", ""The Counterfeiter"" & ""The Killing"") to helping resistance movements (""The Astrologer"" & ""Trial By Fury"") the IM team were indeed a force to be reckoned with. The series would even delve into personal territory when Jim stumbles onto an assassination plot by accident and the team are called in to save both him and foil the scheme in the episode ""The Town"".

There is a sense of confidence at play here when watching the season season of ""Mission: Impossible"". The episodes are still smartly written, well acted and expertly produced. This measure of success also translates effectively for viewers to as the series began to outperform it's competition - ratings wise. Not surprisingly, by the end of the second season, the buzz factor had well and truly kicked in and the show established itself as tv's hottest spy series.

For retro kicks, season two of ""Mission: Impossible"" is well worth checking out.. Treat yourself to some fun.....",1200528000,12,2798,5.071739130434783

2775017,3,B000NOIX66,"This second season Mission Impossible introduces the Mr Phelps we all remember - Peter Graves.

These campy 60s era-shows are imaginative ""spy vs. spy"". It's humorous to watch them now if you remember watching them back in the day when they aired on prime time tv. Now, there's a refreshing quaintness - the vintage cars, the 60s fashions, phonograph records that are played on actual turntables, ribbon typewriters, payphone calls that cost only a dime, US currency still backed by gold safely guarded at Fort Knox, endless war against the international communist conspiracy, and the now-world-famous self-destructing reel-to-reel tapes ensconced in recondite places. These twenty-five shows on 7 CDs are a light-hearted romp.

The only downside I remark is that our taste in programming has matured since the 60s, so while fun to watch I doubt these programs hold up to repeated viewing - (my standard acid test for quality programming). That said, the stories are plot-driven and character-driven rather than special effects-driven, which is another nostalgic breath of fresh air.

As always, Mr Phelps' gazes down at the San Francisco skyline in deep thought beside his chess board. As always, pictures of the veteran operatives (Rollin Hand, Cinnamon Carter, Willy Armitage, Barney Collier) lay on the table beside him:

2775020,5,B000NOIX66,"With its second season (1967-68) Bruce Geller's ""Mission: Impossible"" hit its stride. This was the season in which ace writers William Read Woodfield and Allan Balter took the series' reins in hand and never let go (until, sadly, about eight episodes into the third season). With Woodfield and Balter creating scripts and editing all others, the classic ""M:I"" format was set: The Big Con, rigged by the ""Impossible Missions Force,"" in which the heaviest of heavies ended up undermining or eliminating one another. This is also the season in which Peter Graves first (and seamlessly) took over as team leader Jim Phelps, Martin Landau committed himself to the series as the indispensable cast member he was, and all five regulars--Graves, Landau (as Rollin Hand), Barbara Bain (Cinammon Carter), Greg Morris (Barney Collier), and Peter Lupus (Willy Armitidge)--came together in every episode as an inseparable team. This season also gave us some of the series' finest and most memorable episodes: ""The Seal"" (a ""Topkapi"" caper starring a trained tabby), ""The Council"" (a stellar two-parter, recut and released in Europe as a feature, ""Mission: Impossible vs. The Mob""), ""The Photographer"" (the IMF stages, for a traitorous audience of two, the end of the world by nuclear destruction), and ""The Killing"" (a ghost story done up in splendid ""Mission"" style). Emmy Nominations and Awards abounded.

Two final notes: First, this is television that has to be watched and paid attention to. It is utterly entertaining and engrossing, but treats viewers as intelligent beings who can follow intricate plotting that is highly visual, with minimal exposition. Second: Forget the recent, self-indulgent Tom Cruise spectacles and return to the original. This, and this alone, is ""Mission: Impossible"" as Bruce Geller created it.

show and was so impressed with the loving care given to it's
restoration that I preordered season 2 immediately when it was
available. For a show that was originally recorded in mono the
Dolby digital 5.1 remix sounds impressive. Visually, I dare
anyone to compare the picture quality with anything produced
in the last 20 years. The colors are vibrant (damn, that Barbara Bain
was a sexy woman)and sharp. Compare this to the poor job FOX
has done with it's releases of classic older shows and you can
appreciate the quality in Paramounts releases (they did a great job on
season 1 of Hawaii 5-0, too). St Elsewhere was probably
the finest medical drama ever produced for TV (certainly a damn sight
better than crap like Gray's Anatomy) and Fox slapped it together with
absolutely no respect! The picture is fuzzy and the sound is muddy on
most of the episodes. M.I. is at least 15 years older than St. Elsewhere
and there is absolutely no comparison to the quality. Whoevers running
the TV/DVD division at FOX ought to be sent to purgatory for the disrespect
shown to it's MTM collection alone. This was probably the greatest studio for
quality tv in the 70's and 80's. I almost hate to open my box set of Hill
Street Blues!

Okay, getting back to the show. You could see Martin Landau's Talent
emerging that would lead to his well deserved Oscar later in his career.
Peter Graves would inherit the lead role (from an equally competant Steven
Hill) and be forever linked to baby boomer memories. Tom Cruise is a
good actor (and if you're looking for lot's of special effects go rent
the movies) but if you're looking for thought provoking entertainment,

2775069,4,B000NOIX66,"""Mission Impossible"" represents intelligent TV.  If this is the first time that you are watching these episodes, maybe you may become a little bored because you can't quite follow what they are doing to achieve their goal.  Don't let this discourage you.  What made ""Mission Impossible"" such a great show is when you watch that particular episode again.  When ""Mission Impossible"" started to be shown in syndication later in the seventies, it was great to see an episode that you already saw and know of it's successful conclusion.  These are the kinds of shows that you will enjoy watching over and over.  If you've already watched all of Season One of ""Mission Impossible"", wait a few months and start watching them again.  Start of with the episode that you enjoyed the most.  You'll see what I mean about watching it with a new perspective.  Watching it and knowing how it will end.  This show was just one of the best shows on television.

Anyway....about the quality of this DVD release.  The picture quality is excellent for it's time and it's even mastered in 5.1 audio.  The opening theme never sounded so good.

Has anyone noticed that Mission Impossible, and various other TV shows from the 1960's look and sound better than the TV shows put on DVD from the late seventies and the eighties?

I have a theory.  I think sometime during the seventies, someone created a low cost film that Hollywood decided to use to save money.  The quality of the picture may have looked about the same, but perhaps that particular film quality has a much shorter shelf life and the quality of the finished film starts to deteriorate within just a few years.  Check it out for yourself.  If you collect television series DVD's, compare the picture qualities of your favorite sixties shows with your favorite shows of the eighties.  For instance, ""Mission Impossible"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", and ""Star Trek"" all look a lot better of DVD than ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", and even ""Married with Children"".  Even some of the later seasons of M*A*S*H got a little fuzzier then the first few seasons.

You know, I could be wrong.  It's just a theory.  But check it out for yourself. I see a pattern of diminishing video quality as shows drift from the sixties up to and through the eighties.  Does anyone else see this?  Can anyone out there say that I'm right?",1184112000,3,2365,4.721271393643032

Each week, the thinking man could watch a story unfold.  Like a murder mystery, you never quite knew how it was going to unfold in the end, except that the MI Force would win.

2775085,4,B000NOIX66,"Can't think of a clever enough title for my review, but I can say that I'm pleased as punch to get my paws on this set.

I have been bitching for YEARS about this program's absence from the DVD racks, and I was nearly hysterical when I found out that Paramount got their stuff together. I have a sneaking suspicion that Tom Cruise's departure from Paramount (after he exposed himself as a hysterical fanatic on the public airwaves) led to the flexibility for Paramount to finally release the DVD's of the original series. Cruise was probably concerned that the obviously superior writing and performances found on the original show would put a crimp in his rep as Mr. M:I. He would be right!

 Anyway, after a nostalgic headlong-leap into the original series DVD's, I can honestly say that I wear the wet-lipped grin of a toddler at the circus, with every sharp-witted episode I re-watch. In retrospect, I'm starting to think that I dig Briggs more than Phelps, but the complexity of the plots definitely grew in season 2. I'm sure Graves needed a few episodes to break himself into the role. By disc 3, his magic is beginning to surface.

 The transfer looks good, and the colors look surprisingly crisp for a show that's nearly 40 years old. One star has to come off for the packaging. Nice box w/ slim cases (I like this trend), but absolutely NO extras. No booklet, no featurette.... nothing. Back to the days when ""chapter selection"" was touted as a ""special feature"". Regardless, nothing can take the shine off this, the most cherished of all my classic TV memories. (Odd Couple, too).

EDIT: Oh, I noticed that, in Season 2, Episode 7: Operation 'Heart', there is a Georges Rouault painting hanging in Pernell Roberts' office.... The very same one that hung in Brigg's apartment for the entirety of season #1!....

I know re-using props is common, I just like Rouault.",1182816000,4,1875,4.715596330275229
2775086,5,B000NOIX66,"Living near Nyc I have often come into the city to see shows. I have often been suprised when I see a television actor who gives an outstanding performance. How is this possible? on television they are only so-so.

This is not the case with mission impossible. Then husband and wife team of Bain and Landau have one of the best roles ever written for television. they do not play stupid one dimensional characters as is common on t.v. They are allowed to give tour de force performances and to suprise us every week. Greg Collins as the only African American is the genius of the group and is remarkably cool and confident and often takes technical control on some of the missions. Peter Lupus is strong and confident and never lets you see him sweat. Peter Graves comes off as non-threatening and middle of the road apple-pie. Who would suspect that he was the ploting brain behind these chess -game plots.",1181433600,7,907,4.598765432098766
2775087,5,B000NOIX66,"When the first season was released last year it was more of a blind buy for me than anything, based on fuzzy childhood memories and a well-known theme song. But I had so much fun with the set that I immediately grabbed the second season when it came out.

Season 2 introduces Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, and with his arrival we have what is arguably the show's best-known roster. Objectively I'm torn between Graves and Steven Hill, the first season leader; Graves has a warmer appeal, and he stayed with the show longer, but Hill had more of a special-ops toughness to him. Also debuting as a full cast member is Martin Landau, after spending season 1 under guest billing. Landau always steals the show, and his extensive prosthetics are the coolest element of any episode as well as what takes the most suspension of disbelief.

Speaking of which, there's a tad more of that going on this season. Maybe it's a side-effect of watching so many episodes back-to-back, but you start to question how far ahead the IMF plan to manipulate the bad guy into a certain room, or have them pull a gun at that right moment. Some traps seem overly elaborate for a relatively mild objective, but that's half the fun. The budget this season also seems a little higher; there's less obvious set-redressing like that large room from season 1 that doubled as a lobby/casino/police station/prison/etc.

So 7-discs in nice slim cases covering 25 remastered episodes, which look and sound great. The glaring lack of subtitles from the season 1 set has been fixed. A great value for any spy genre fan, and a great series for those who like classic television.",1181174400,23,1638,4.700348432055749
2775088,1,B000NOIX66,"If you notice the first season set is titled the ""complete"" first season.  ""Complete"" is missing from season two.  Word is (from another region's release) that season two contains episodes ""edited from the original"".  Buyer beware.",1179273600,29,231,5.361111111111111
2775089,5,B000NOIX66,"This is the real thing, the original Mission Impossible. The stories are brilliant with intricate plots, subtle and intelligent. The missions rely on team work and dedication. At the start of each episode the leader picks the members of the team based on their unique abilities, who then proceed to make marvels of intrigue. There are no stars, nor is there James Bond like glory. Instead the group works together like a well oiled machine to the point of perfection. It is too bad we don't get more show like it.",1179100800,13,513,4.648351648351649
2775090,5,B000NOIX66,"Oh, what they did to this franchise with those lousy movies.  It's like what they do with the Tom Clancy books to movies (except Red October).  They buy the brand name for a gazillion bucks, then completely change the story as to make it unrecognizable.  But the people buy the movie tickets based upon the name of the book/TV show they love.  BTW, I considered the departure of Bain/Landau a wash.  Losing Landau was a minus, but losing Bain was a big plus.  I always considered the Cinnamon character a little sad.  She was represented as the ultimate object of desire, the top model in the world and the ultimate femme fatale.  Actually, Barbara Bain was a. not what anyone could call gorgeous and b. a little old for the part.  The way she strutted and posed was a bit pathetic and cringe-inducing.  Can't wait to screen season 2.",1177372800,7,834,4.5369127516778525
2775091,5,B000NOIX66,"At last, the much anticipated second season of Mission Impossible. This is where Peter Graves takes over from Stephen Hill as Jim Phelps. Although Mr. Hill did a fine job, I would venture to say that most of us who remember the series place Mr. Graves as the head of the MI force.

For those of you who think of MI based on the Tom Cruise movies, this is entirely different (and much, much better). The television series is NOT comprised of a bunch of ""flash/bang"" scenes slapped together in a two-hour film clip designed to make a buck. The TV series was an intelligent attempt (which succeeded for the most part) in portraying a highly specialized and trained group of individuals working for a top secret government department who got missions which were otherwise; well, impossible. They would accomplish this through a meticulous and clever plan, which in most instances involved conning the enemy involved. There were few car chases or gun battles in these episodes (unless the MI force planned them in advance), yet each installment was captivating as we would watch the plot unwind and the bad guy get his just dues.

Yes, we know that by the end of the hour the IM force is going to be successful in its mission each time - but what is so fascinating is how they do it (we are privy to only part of the plan each time at the beginning of the show). The plots often have more twists than a pretzel and are believable (with a couple of exceptions).

Very few of the installments were ""losers"", which made the TV series well above average overall. The program lasted for seven seasons and outlasted all of the other ""spy programs"" (such as `The Man from U.N.C.L.E', `I Spy', `Get Smart', etc) during the 1960's spy program craze.

If you haven't yet seen the original television program, do yourself a great favor and try one of the two sets soon available (Season One is available right now). Sit back in your favorite chair with your friends or family and prepare to be delighted. I'll bet you'll find the episodes are like Lays Potato Chips - can't watch just one.

Highly Recommended
