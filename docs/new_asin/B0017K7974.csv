8266258,3,B0017K7974,"I was hoping for better quality than what this video shows.  It is a lovely shallow and wide stream, very blue water with great natural sounds and music.  The problem is that the video I received is not as sharp as it should be and is a little out of focus. If the picture were sharper, it would be quite enchanting.  I have purchased two other videos by this company, ""Endless Beach"" and ""Campfire Memories"" and I love both of them, they are very fun to watch.",1432252800,,461,4.275862068965517
8266259,4,B0017K7974,"I have been spirted away to a far off place. Im somewhere deep in bushland, and standing beside a very large wide creek, That has running blue water and white water. The flowing water is just sparkling. I can see a waterfall in the distance, and hear the sweet sounds of birds. This is truely a wonderful sight. This is total isolation. Its just ME and NATURE. I feel very relaxed and happy. And i never want to leave this magical place. But i know that i can return again, whenever i wish. For total relaxtion, VISIT THE CREEK.",1334880000,,528,4.343434343434343
