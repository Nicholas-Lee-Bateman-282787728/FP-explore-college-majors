8389264,5,B0035WARXU,"When one thinks of Leonard Bernstein one does not automatically think of Debussy. He did conduct Debussy, of course, but music of the French master was not one of his frequent choices. However, he did talk knowingly and creatively about Debussy in his lauded series of 'Young People's Concerts' lectures, and he certainly had superb ability to conduct impressionist music. When he did so he tended to lead performances with more spine, more edge, more form than is often the case with music of that genre.

One does not tend to think of the Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia, Rome, when one thinks about great orchestras. They are probably the best orchestra Italy has to offer, but let's remember that Italy is not the natural home of purely orchestral music. And when one thinks of the combination of Bernstein and the Santa Cecilia one would not naturally think of the music of Debussy. Yet, here it is -- a full concert of three Debussy masterpieces: Images for Orchestra, Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, and La Mer. And quite good, too, particularly for a live concert given only once with no chance for the producers and video and sound engineers to patch together the best bits from several concerts.

The concert opens with the Images for Orchestra, Debussy's last orchestral work. Bernstein alters the order of the three sections, playing Gigues, then Rondes de printemps, and finally the tripartite Ib&eacute;ria with its exciting finish. He's not the first to do this and indeed one wonders why Debussy chose the order in which they were published. It takes Bernstein and the orchestra a little bit of time to settle in with Gigues, probably the most evanescent of the three sections, but once they do they give an effective performance. The same is true for Rondes de printemps. But they really come into their own with Ib&eacute;ria. The winds are prominent, of course, as they are in all of Debussy, and those of the Santa Cecilia are in really fine form. However, when we come to Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun they really shine. The principal flute gives as evocative a playing of the opening solo as I've heard. I wish I knew his name. (This concert, by the way, was filmed in June 1989 and so that makes it difficult to research the name of the flutist. Incidentally, the concert was only a little more than a year before Bernstein's death.) Bernstein's subtle alterations of the lengths of the final beats -- sometimes a little hurried, sometimes languorous -- of those 6/8 measures in the middle of the piece is the work of an interpretive genius.

What can one say about La Mer? It is surely one Debussy work that is most 'impressionistic'. The first section, 'From dawn to noon on the sea' is deliciously done. Could anything be more 'impressionistic' than the shift in orchestration when the sun reaches its midday zenith? (One remembers Satie's crack about particularly liking the bit at quarter to eleven.) 'The play of the waves', with its gentle shiftings of timbre, melody and rhythm is magical. 'Dialogue of the wind and the sea' has always seemed to me to emphasize one of the features of impressionism: a dreamscape. One is gently rocked back and forth by the movement of the wind and the sea while observing the action through a scrim of subtle orchestration, as in a dream. Bernstein and the orchestra capture this wonderfully, although I must admit I slightly prefer Bernstein's audio recording of this movement with the New York Philharmonic.

The advantage of this DVD, of course, is getting to see as well as hear Bernstein work his magic, even with a less than absolutely top-notch orchestra who, for him, play above themselves.

Recommended.
