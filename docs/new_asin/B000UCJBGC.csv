8212932,1,B000UCJBGC,"This is a very disappointing exercise dvd. The narration is out of sync with the movements, which becomes very distracting and irritating. The instructions are several seconds behind the actual movements on the dvd, so there are no prompts to tell you how many repetitions the instructor intends doing. Most often, she has moved on to the next sequence, while the narration is telling you 'don't give up' on the previous sequence. The music has obviously been added afterwards, and is out of sync with the movements. Moreover, many of the movements are not well explained, and the beginner could risk injury because the proper technique is not well described. I don't recommend this dvd. In fact, my copy is going up on Trademe, as soon as I'm done with this review!",1215820800,,766,4.8106060606060606
