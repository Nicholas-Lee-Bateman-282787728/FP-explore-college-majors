8696624,1,B00RZXWVQG,"DO NOT BUY.
An ACL rip-off. Bad Picture, only 50 mins. long. Even at $12, it sucks. Shame on Lazer Media, going for the fast buck
with a low quality product. Buyer Be Ware !!",1437264000,,174,4.0
8696625,3,B00RZXWVQG,"either a bit misleading, or I didn't read the description well enough.  I presumed that it was John Hiatt singing along with Kelly Willis, but it is some songs by J.H. and some by K.W.  Looks like it may be recordings of sessions from Austin City Limits shows.",1435881600,,260,4.395833333333333
8696626,2,B00RZXWVQG,"This DVD has short comings when it comes to picture quality.  The picture is grainy on wide screen, I understand that's because  of the picture ratio.  The picture is dark as well. The recording in from Austin City Limits 2000?  It is a shame for John Hiatt and Kelly Willis that this performance was not released in a better fashion. I don't find the audio quality to be the best, especially on John Hiatt.  Yes the title is even misleading, it should be John Hiatt AND Kelly Willis, each perform six songs on this DVD. They do not perform together. John and Kelly are great artist, so if you are a die hard you may want to buy, but this not the best recording.",1434153600,,662,4.306451612903226
8696627,4,B00RZXWVQG,"This latest DVD from Laser Media contains 50 minutes of performances from the October 26, 2000 episode of the  ""Austin City Limits"" PBS show (there are no end titles but the stage setting - with Austin's Capitol building in background is unmistakable). This was the second show in ACL's 26th season. Though the package gives John Hiatt the attention (though it says ""featuring Kelly Willis), they each share half the songs; first six by Hiatt, and then six by Willis.

The sound really good and the images sharp for the age. This was recorded back in the pre-widescreen days and the image is the standard 1:33to1 screen aspect ratio,

Obviously this is not an authorized release from Austin City Limits (which has been on the air for  40  years!) but fans of either Hiatt or Willis who may not have seen these early performances may want this budget DVD for their collection.
The DVD has chapter stops so you can go direct to an individual song.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
