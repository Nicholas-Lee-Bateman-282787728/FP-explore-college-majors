8023330,4,B0002804I8,"I picked up this DVD about 3 yrs ago to get a few new drills to run during practice.  I take time before each season to review the drills and allow the coaching staff to get on the same page.  It helps alot when your working through those first few weeks of conditioning, etc.  It's not very long, but the drills are demonstrated by kids which helps.  With younger teams, some drills may work better than others or need slight adjustments.  All and all, not a bad investment for any coach.  I think the DVD should be priced around $20, but that's just my opinion.",1303084800,,563,4.314285714285714
8023331,3,B0002804I8,"This DVD goes over some of the fundamentals, but it does not dig deep enough and does not tell you why to do certain things. It needs to be expanded with the better details for coaches and youth players. I watched this with my son and he learned very few things he had not learned the first 2 weeks of practice.",1187740800,3,311,4.114754098360656
8023332,5,B0002804I8,"Not sure what the problem was with the earlier reviews.  Appears there could have been a problem with the manufacturing.  I ordered this DVD and found it a great aide to help develop young and new coaches on teaching the basic fundamentals of blocking, tackling, running, and passing.  Excellent fundamentals for center and quarterback exchange.  Teaches technique for quarterback drops for passing attack.  Highly recommend.",1182038400,3,425,5.476923076923077
8023333,4,B0002804I8,The video was very old school. It took my boys back to basics,1167868800,,61,3.769230769230769
8023334,1,B0002804I8,I ordered one of these DVDs and it was blank; nothing on it.  Amazon sent me a replacement and it was also blank.  I wasted time and money(before getting a refund) on a product I never was able to use.,1126483200,8,201,4.0
8023335,5,B0002804I8,"If your youth football program is anything like my son's, then you will want to get this video.  There is no teaching of the basics at my son's practices.  They focus mostly on plays and drills of the basics are non-existent.  My husband played football and has worked with our son on the basics, but he is on call several nights and can't help as much as he would like.  This video has allowed me to learn how my son should be doing things and practice drills even I can help him with.  His skills have really improved.  It breaks everything down very simply and does a great job of showing you what you need to do to master the skills of blocking and tackling.  I highly recommend this video.",1126483200,14,694,4.292307692307692
8023336,1,B0002804I8,I purchaesed the video and received it and it did not play on any DVD player I tried. I sent it back for replacement and that one did not play either.,1125273600,7,150,3.870967741935484
8023337,1,B0002804I8,"I received this DVD and was unable to play it as the DVD player indicates a disc error. I returned it to Amazon and received a second DVD 2 weeks later. Same problem with new DVD- unable to view it.

Very dissapointed. Poor quality control.",1123804800,6,240,4.333333333333333
8023338,1,B0002804I8,"$30 bucks is way too much for what you get.  Very short and general.  If you can get it for under $10 it's a good way to kill 30 minutes, but besides that, it's a rip off.",1122249600,11,171,3.5945945945945947
