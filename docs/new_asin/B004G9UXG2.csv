4372740,5,B004G9UXG2,The camera work of the Mountain and summit are great. The story about who George Mallory was and how he ended up where he did are are very interesting. If you like great adventure stories about Mount Everest this is one to have.,1308528000,,228,4.325581395348837
4372741,5,B004G9UXG2,"The Wildest Dream is the biography of George Mallory who was the first European to try to climb Mt. Everest in the 1920's.  It is also the account of the climbers who discovered Mallory's frozen body 75 years later near the summit.  Did he make it???  No one will ever know.  We do know that he was a unique individual who was an athelete, adventurer, artist, romantic and poet.  Ane he was a dreamer, with the conquest of Everest being the Wildest Dream that gripped his heart.

We first saw this movie on Netflix, and it captured my attention from beginning to end.  As soon as the final credits were over I went on Amazon and ordered it for my dad as a Father's day gift.

It is part romance, part detective mystery, and part adventure.  I found it interesting because my daughter is a mountain climber, and it gave me some perspective about what makes her tick.  It was one of the most interesting stories I have come across in a long time, especially since I am an avid history buff and love tales of the Human Experience.  Stories like this one always capture my immagination.

If you like real life romance and adventure, this flick is for you.  No fiction could be half as amazing as the tale of George Mallory, who had to be one of the most unique individuals of the 20th century.",1306886400,3,1289,4.3881856540084385
4372742,5,B004G9UXG2,"George Mallory's love of mountain climbing led, inevitably to Everest.  His amazing story and his desire to conquer in the name of his country had been all but lost until this dramatic documentary appeared.  While it could have delved deeper into Mallory's earlier expeditions, and his relationship with other would-be Everest climbers, the footage of these expeditions and the last, are vividly telling.

Looking at Mallory's frozen corpse, still reposing on those frozen slopes, brought me closer to him than did any of my earlier research into his life. And watching the modern day climb, to the top of the world, gave stark evidence of the difficulties that Mallory, and others of his day, faced.

Did he reach the top?  The question may never be answered.  For me, the absence of the photograph is compelling proof that he did.",1305417600,19,832,4.9496402877697845
4372743,5,B004G9UXG2,"I am just very interested in Mt. Everest and this movie was very interesting and very well done. I have seen it before in the IMAX and at the Boulder, Colorado International Film Festival.",1304208000,,188,4.5588235294117645
4372744,5,B004G9UXG2,"Would love to have seen this at the IMAX. Scenery is spectacular. ""Paths of Glory"" by Jeffery Archer, a written account of George Mallory's life, is one of my favorite books and I would recommend that anyone who watches this video also read the book. The video held my attention and I could not move from my chair for quite a while after it ended.
I like to believe that he reached the summit.",1303171200,14,393,4.324324324324325
4372745,5,B004G9UXG2,"This documentary details the life and accomplishments of George Leigh Mallory, specifically his dream and obsession with Everest.  It also follows mountaineer Conrad Anker on a parallel quest to summit Everest under the same conditions that Mallory and Andrew Irvine may or may not have in June of 1924. It is refreshing to see how humble Mallory was in comparison to some modern mountaineers like Ed Viesturs about his accomplishments and how simple his quest was.  Mallory climbed to fulfill his dreams, not to flaunt his accomplishments and corporate sponsorships like a petulant high schooler trying to get favor with the in crowd.  When asked why should one climb Mount Everest, Mallory simply and famously stated ""because it is there"".  This documentary is sure to please everyone from the avid mountaineer to the armchair adventurer alike.",1303084800,3,846,5.198529411764706
4372746,5,B004G9UXG2,Stands up both as a documentary as well as a dramatization. This should be in every mountaineer's library. Don't rent - buy.,1300492800,3,124,4.681818181818182
4372747,5,B004G9UXG2,"In June of 1924, British explorer George Mallory wrote to his wife Ruth: ""There is no dream that mustn't be dared."" He was weeks into a trek with a huge support team of animals and Sherpas as part of his quest to ascend to the highest spot on earth: mighty Mount Everest, 29,002 feet above sea level.

The North and South Poles had been conquered of recent, but this ""third pole"" remained defiantly aloof and yet beckoning and apparently invincible, its peak surrounded by a ""death zone.""  Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine were last seen only 800 feet below the summit when they disappeared in the clouds.

Cut to 1999, Mt. Everest 75 years later.  Renowned American climber Conrad Anker makes a discovery that becomes a global news event: he finds the body of George Mallory.

This astonishing and dangerous to make documentary, directed by Anthony Geffen, weaves Anker's story with Mallory's.  Breathtaking images high on Everest and at the summit show Anker and his partner as they attempt to recreate Mallory's climb using the same clothing, equipment and route.  Rare historical footage of Mallory's actual expedition is beautifully integrated with the jaw-dropping new footage.

The story is greatly enhanced with words from Mallory's letters and those of his wife Ruth as read by Liam Neeson and his late wife Natasha Richardson.  Other fine voices are from Ralph Feinnes, Hugh Dancy and Alan Rickman.

Mallory planned to leave a photo of his wife at the summit and the only thing missing from his personal effects when his frozen body was found in the ""death zone"" was a photo of Ruth.  Anker's left a copy of her portrait on the peak.  Mallory's body remains where it fell -- most likely on his descent after being the first known person to summit the world's highest point.

This 93 minute armchair adventure of the highest order just ended an extended run at our local Desert Imax, and is now available in a superb Blu-ray edition.  Mallory, when asked why he wanted to risk all to conquer Everest famously said, ""Because it is there.""  And maybe that's a good enough reason to find this disc.  (A lengthy bonus features raw interview footage from Anker, director Geffen, and film crew.)",1300320000,63,2212,4.827586206896552

4372761,3,B004G9UXG2,"I haven't seen the movie yet but it was Mallory and Erskine. Not Mallory and a companion.  The focus in these blurbs and comments excluding Erskine are offensive to true mountaineering  And why ?  What who tries to eliminate Erskine?  And why the Brag about being the first person to see Mallory. ?  It was an expedition not the author up there by himself. Disgusting egotism.

4372769,4,B004G9UXG2,"The Movie was a must see.
I believe Mallory died on his way UP.
The lack of sleep and proper gear and clothes indicates that it would have been most unlikely
he summited. It is Speculation that he reached the summit.

While clinging  to the mountain with his broken leg (his body found  ....75 years later below the summit) he may have taken Ruth's picture and aid it next to him, in which the winds and snow might have vanished it forever. Interestingly and not notes in the movie he had an affair rumored with a female climber whom he was very close with. SO much for the romance with RUTH. Perhaps  that's why he chose to leave her and climb in dreadful weather?
IN any case the movie has great visual,s and I just adore the climax ..cheers!",1443312000,,744,4.330935251798561

4372805,2,B004G9UXG2,"This movie has some wonderful pictures of Everest; but it suffers from the usual presumptiousness of the guys making such films. In this case someone apparently got it into his oxygen-deprived mindset to reenact the 'possibly first climb' of Everest by two mountaineers who died in the attempt and one of whose bodies was found recently by same person. Of course, they do not reenact anything. They simply climb Everest, dragging some old-fashioned shoes with them which they wear for a few hours one day. They skip the famous Chinese ladder and climb that piece instead (with their modern equipment, not even with the old style boots); then they claim that this ""proves"" that the former climbers ""could have made it"". How idiotic that statement is, noone seems to notice. There is no mention and no sight of how Everest is marketed today and how the feat of summiting has changed over the years. There is in fact nothing in this movie other than the vanity of the protagonist and his obnoxious mystical idea that somehow, having found the body makes him very special and makes his climb very special also - somehow. Sort of annoying. However, nice pictures of Everest, and we do get to see a tiny bit of material on the original summit attempt.",1387497600,,1245,4.741935483870968

4372826,4,B004G9UXG2,"On June 8, 1924, Noel Odell, a member of the British Mt. Everest expedition, saw fellow expedition members George Mallory and Andrew Irvine climbing along the mountain's Northeast Ridge toward the summit.  Then the two climbers disappeared in the clouds and were never seen alive again.  Their fate, and whether they actually reached the summit, has been one of mountaineering's great mysteries.  ""Wildest Dream"" begins with the discovery of Mallory's frozen body on the North Face of Mount Everest.  Conrad Anker, who made the discovery, felt compelled to learn about Mallory, and eventually decided to re-create Mallory's last climb, in order to answer the enduring question,  Could Mallory and his companion Sandy Irvine have reached the summit?

Using archival footage and photographs, letters between Mallory and his wife Ruth, and interviews with Mallory's granddaughter and Irvine's great niece, the film traces Mallory's life and his role in the British Everest expeditions of 1921 and 1922, as well as the fatal 1924 expedition.  Combined with this is the story of Anker's 2007 attempt to repeat Mallory's final climb.  As Mallory had selected the athletic, but inexperienced Irvine as his climbing partner, Anker chose the similarly athletic but inexperienced Leo Houlding to accompany him.  Of course, Anker enjoyed many advantages that history denied to Mallory.  Nonetheless, during his attempt to climb the Second Step (one of three large rock outcroppings) along Mount Everest's Northeast Ridge, Anker slipped.  Thus, in a film about how Mallory and Irvine fell to their deaths, we come chillingly close to seeing Anker and Houlding fall to their deaths.  The ascent of the Second Step that gave Anker trouble likely followed the same route he managed easily 8 years earlier--evidence of how conditions can change on the mountain.

 ""Wildest Dream"" passes over some of the more gruesome aspects of the story--the fact that a rock had punctured a hole in Mallory's skull during his fall, perhaps killing him, and the presence, in this same area, of 17 other bodies. This is one of the best Mt. Everest CDs; but it overlooks much of the evidence, and its implied conclusion, that if Mallory and Irvine mastered the Second Step they must have reached the summit, is open to question.  (Ironically, Anker had previously argued that they probably did not reach the summit. See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Explorer-Finding-Mallory-On-Mount-Everest/dp/0684871513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Explorer : Finding Mallory On Mount Everest</a>.)  In fact, the Second Step may not have been their greatest challenge--in 1995, Mallory's grandson pronounced it ""easy"" and climbed it without trouble.

Students of the 1924 expedition have expatiated at length on evidence relating to Mallory and Irvine's final summit attempt.  One key piece of evidence is Odell's 12:50 p.m. sighting of the pair.  If they had reached only the First Step by that time, they were seriously behind schedule; but, if they had reached the Third Step (at the base of the final pyramid), their prospects for reaching the summit were excellent.  Unfortunately, Odell changed his account over time, so we do not know for certain on which of three steps he saw Mallory and Irvine.  Another piece of evidence is Mallory and Irvine's oxygen supply.  The conventional assumption seems to be that they each had two full oxygen bottles--at the maximum rate, that would have provided them with oxygen for about 8 hours.  In this scenario, their oxygen might have been exhausted before they reached the summit, perhaps before they reached the Third Step, quite possibly forcing them to turn back.  But others have argued that Mallory and Irvine each had a partially full oxygen bottle in addition to two full ones, enough perhaps to get them to the summit or close to it.  But again, unfortunately, we do not how much oxygen they had; nor can we be sure that all their oxygen bottles were functioning (many had leaked or malfunctioned).  More generally, many modern climbers allow 12 hours for the ascent from their high camp to the summit.  British climbers on the 1924 expedition seem not have begun their climbs until about 6:00 a.m.  Even if they started earlier, Mallory and Irvine could not have reached the summit until late afternoon.  And it would be dark at 7:00 p.m.  At some point, it may have become clear to Mallory, even if he still had oxygen, that he could not summit and still descend in daylight--and some modern climbers have concluded that it is impossible to descend the Second Step in darkness.  (One is reminded of Hillary's description of his 1953 climb--""almost getting a little desperate  .  .  .  the summit never seemed to be getting any closer."")  In this situation, would Mallory have yielded to his urge to summit, or turned back in recognition of his responsibility to his companion and his wife?  Since Mallory intended to place a photograph of his wife on the summit, its absence from his personal effects has been adduced as evidence that he did reach the summit.  But it seems quite possible that Mallory left Ruth's picture, not at the summit, but at the highest point that he did reach, knowing that she was more anxious to have him back alive than to have her photograph on the summit.  (The available evidence has been the basis for various theories.  One of which is that Mallory appropriated whatever oxygen was available for his own solo attempt on the summit, and told Irvine to return to the high camp or wait along the route.)

""Wildest Dream"" provides a good portrait of Mallory and his climbing career. But it omits much evidence, and does not persuade this reviewer that Mallory reached the summit of Mount Everest.",1362787200,14,5796,5.129925452609159

4372831,3,B004G9UXG2,"The Wildest Dream: Conquest Of Everest is a 93 minute long film, directed by Anthony Geffen, that touches at one of the oldest dreams I had; to go rockhunting on an archaeological dig and find something magical and wondrous. As a child, I recall reading in a science book about Luos Agassiz and how he proved the fact that glaciers, indeed, do move, by pinpointing the spot where a mountain climber was lost on an Alpine Peak, predicting that the body would show up at the bottom of the glacier after a certain number of years, only to find the body just as predicted. This film does not open exactly in that manner, but it does open with modern mountain climber Conrad Anker finding the body of Mount Everest legend George Mallory in 1999, 75 years after he and a colleague, Sandy Irvine, were lost and presumed dead on the world's tallest mountain. This pushes Anker to want to try and prove that Mallory did reach the summit three decades earlier than Edmund Hillary. To do so, Anker and a colleague of his own, attempt to reproduce Mallory's ascent in vintage 1920s gear.

  The film then alternates between the modern quest, made in 2007, and the original quest of Mallory, via archival films, photos, and letters. What drives Anker is the fact that Mallory seems to have made his descent in twilight, when he slipped and broke a leg, then dies on the slope. This indicates that he must have made a bid for the top before descending, for he was last seen near the top on the morning of June 8th, 1924, just a few hundred feet from the top, but his body was found almost 3000 feet lower. The time of his death is ascertained by the fact that he was not wearing the sun visors needed to prevent whiteouts from ice glare. Also, Mallory had promised to plant his wife's photo at the summit but the photo has never been found. Neither has Mallory's climbing partner, Irvine.

  The film has spectacular scenery, but the cinematography, by Chris Openshaw, is nothing great. Geffen does a good job of interweaving the two tales, but far too much time is taken up on the silly and narcissistic modern tale. More time spent on Mallory's plight would have helped the film, while also lopping off 15-20 minutes of fat. The film is narrated by actor Liam Neeson. The film could have used, aside from a tighter focus on Mallory, a greater array of mountaineering expert and historian commentary but, overall, it is well suited to be an introduction to the life of a legendary hero of exploration's Golden Age's final years.",1359676800,3,2515,4.5777777777777775

4372842,5,B004G9UXG2,"This DVD explores one of history's most fascinating mysteries: Were Mallory and Irvine the first to summit Everest?

As Irvine prophetically declared, of their pioneer 1924 bid to be the first to summit Everest, ""IF THIS IS A ONE-WAY TICKET, SO BE IT.""

Modern climbers have a ""TWO O'CLOCK RULE,"" meaning if one is near to or on Everest's summit, one must begin one's descent absolutely NO LATER later than 2:00 PM - to avoid possible perils of storms and darkness.

Mallory and Irvine were last seen 800 feet below Everest's summit, at 1:00 PM.  If Mallory/Irvine did summit Everest, they absolutely could not have begun their descent by the TWO O'CLOCK DEADLINE.  However, ""SUMMIT FEVER"" may have driven Mallory/Irvine to continue their bid to summit Everest.  If Mallory/Irvine did summit Everest, they had probably fatally violated the TWO O'CLOCK RULE.  If so, it is doubtful they could have made a successful decent from Everest's summit.

Some people note Irvine's ""inexperience"" in mountain climbing as an impediment.  However, when entering Everest's ""death zone,"" BOTH Mallory and Irvine were EQUALLY inexperienced in climbing ""at altitude,"" in the ""death zone.""  Irvine, at least, had already been experiencing serious ""altitude sicknesses.""

This DVD shows film of Mallory's frozen corpse on Everest, but shows no oxygen cylinders on or near Mallory's corpse, or a body harness for carrying oxygen cylinders.  This DVD's reenactment, of Mallory's death plunge down Everest, clearly shows Mallory was not wearing any oxygen apparatus - did Mallory discard this body harness earlier, after his oxygen had been exhausted?  This DVD's footage, of a display of artifacts recovered from Mallory's corpse, shows no oxygen cylinders.

Did Mallory/Irvine prematurely exhaust their oxygen supply while in the ""death zone?""  If so, before they died, oxygen deprivation may have caused them to be hallucinating, and probably at night.  This DVD says that Mallory's sun goggles were found in a pocket in clothing on his corpse, indicating Mallory plunged to his death after day had turned to darkness.

Parenthetically, regarding ""climbing weather"" on Everest, in 1996 a number of climbers died simultaneously on their Everest summit day, when they knowingly ignored the TWO O'CLOCK RULE, and became caught in a killer storm.  Their expeditions' leaders had knowingly ignored the TWO O'CLOCK RULE because, during several previous climbing seasons on Everest, these leaders had ALWAYS experienced excellent climbing weather on summit day.  This ""good weather luck"" caused their deadly overconfidence and recklessness.

Powerful wind and snow storms can make climbing on Everest impossible.  For example, prior to this 1996 tragedy, on THREE SUCCESSIVE annual climbing seasons in the 1980s, adverse weather conditions had made climbing on Everest impossible.  However, the two expedition leaders who knowingly violated the TWO O'CLOCK RULE in 1996, and died doing so, had never experienced the adversity of extreme weather conditions on Everest.  Conversely, other climbers on Everest on the fateful day in 1996, who had previously experienced Everest's extreme weather conditions, prudently turned back and aborted their climb.

The foregoing experiences illustrate experiences which the pioneering Mallory/Irving lacked.  However, ""IF THIS IS A ONE-WAY TICKET, SO BE IT.""

A powerful companion to this DVD is a ""NOVA"" DVD entitled EVEREST: THE DEATH ZONE - available on AMAZON.com.  The more facts one knows about this fascinating mystery, the more spellbinding this mystery becomes.",1330128000,6,3582,5.4537205081669695
4372843,4,B004G9UXG2,"Did George Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1924 - almost 30 years before the first official conquering of the world's highest mountain by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay? And when Mallory's body was finally found on the slopes in 1999 just a few thousand feet beneath the 29,000-foot apex - why was the 'only thing missing' on the perfectly preserved remains a black and white photograph of his beautiful wife Ruth? Was it because Mallory had placed that photo on the summit - as he had faithfully promised in his passionate love letters written to her during the ascent?

Both of these questions are tantalizing of course - and I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure by answering either... But I would ask you to give this superb half-drama half-documentary film a look in - because it's a fantastic retelling of a heroic and heartbreaking story - and in many ways a very romantic and inspiring watch.

""The Wildest Dream"" is also a technical astonishment. Conrad Anker - the experienced climber who discovered the body in 1999 - wants to fulfil a lifetime's dream. The American wants to retrace Mallory and Irvine's last fateful journey in June 1924 - right down to using the same clothing and equipment they used. He wants to somehow prove that the brave Englishmen did indeed make it to the top but perished on the descent. Anker therefore pulls in another young climber prodigy to make up the pair (and mad enough to join him) - the incredibly agile Leo Houlding.

But in order to make the film - the beast has to be taken on - cast and crew must grapple with ""...the most determined enemy..."" as Mallory described it on a particularly bad day. They endure genuine hardship - two tons of equipment taken up by foot - altitude sickness - ravines - hypothermia - diarrhoea - life threatening and life-taking danger - it's all here... And adding to the beautifully photographed mountain - and expertly woven-in real footage from 1924 - the superlative voiceovers of Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson, (the late and lovely) Natasha Richardson and Alan Rickman also bring the whole piece to life. But narrated or not - the shots are real - not CGI - serenely peaceful dawns followed by razorblade daytime blizzards - back to huddled tents that evening massaging feet that will not thaw out. As you can imagine much of it is breathtakingly beautiful on BLU RAY - and their pursuit in such treacherous conditions (June is the latest you can tackle the mountain - just before the monsoon winds make it too deadly to attempt) dangerously close to reckless insanity.

Even the hour-long 'making of' - ""Everest: Shooting The Impossible"" - is a feast for the mind and the eyes - full of factoids that wouldn't have had a place in the movie - but fill in the background and your need for more.

George Mallory is like that other great English adventurer Ernest Shackleton - a daring-do man who engendered huge amounts of hero worship. But Mallory also has that mystery about him. Even his most famous comment to a reporter about why anyone would want to climb Mount Everest in the first place (title above) is disputed. Maybe he said it - maybe he didn't? Maybe they made it to the summit - or maybe they died trying - but still valiant and true?

""The Wildest Dream - Conquest Of Everest"" poses as many questions as it does/does not answer. But I'm glad I watched it - because these are great historical characters worth remembering - pioneers who deserved celebration.

4372844,3,B004G9UXG2,"I guess I wasn't paying enough attention at the beginning of the film, because I didn't catch that the initial scenes were from a second expedition to Everest for Conrad Anker. On his first expedition Anker found Mallory's remains and took a few items of historical significance, on the second his attempt was an attempt to try to recreate Mallory's last expedition and to attempt the ""Second Step"" without fixed ropes or ladders. While the general story, particularly the history of Mallory's own expedition and motives is interesting, but this film doesn't put as much weight on Mallory's climb. Anker's own story is less interesting. Anker does give a good depiction of the difficulties of climbing Everest even with modern equipment. However his attempt to recreate Mallory's fatal expedition could have been better. My two two main complaints are that Anker's attempt on the Second Step didn't really prove anything. Conditions on Everest are difficult to recreate 75 years later so it's difficult to make any conclusions about what Mallory was or wasn't capable of at the time. Secondly, Anker and Leo Houlding only used equipment based on Mallory's own to a limited extent on their attempt. Most of their climbing, including the difficult Second Step was done with modern equipment. All honor to Mallory for his attempt on Everest, but unfortunately this film didn't quite live up to expectations.",1325721600,15,1404,5.108695652173913

Teh film shows that someone could free climb the Second Step.  Some people say that it was imposible as he would've had to down climb at night.  I thinkt the film shows that it was very possible to climb up but the climbing down is what probably cost him his life.  George Mallory probably was the first man to summit Everest.

The first part of the film is devoted to painting a picture of George Mallory and his disappearance and is well done.  I think they should have devoted more into the finding of Mallory's body.  There was a small entry where the 2 gentlemen were to test the Mallory period clothing on Everest.  The best I can tell they never used the clothing above 21,000 feet or in snow.  As the films turns into a travel log, the purpose turns to their ""free"" climbing the Second Step.  The filming during this sequence is poorly done.  One is left with a gentleman climbing in the snow beside this large out cropping of rock.  A small segment is also devoted to their successfully summiting Everest.  The extra features are poorly done as well, especially with the English gentleman.  His sentence structure needs improving as well as the physical problem with his shaking as he speaks.  Do yourself a favor and ask for a copy from your local library and save your money on this project.  I must say that I am a big fan of the early British expeditions to Mt Everest especially George and Sandy.  With this said, I don't believe either of them summited Everest.

8428566,5,B004G9UXG2,"National Geographic's documentary, The Wildest Dream: Conquest of Everest, takes audiences on an awe-inspiring, nail-biting climb toward the world's highest peak, Mount Everest.

Directed by BBC veteran Anthony Geffen, the film re-creates legendary British climber George Mallory's ill-fated attempt in 1924 to fulfill a lifelong obsession - to be the first person to tame the 29,029-foot mountain.

The expedition killed him.

Mallory and his companion Andrew ""Sandy"" Irvine were only 800 feet away from the top of the world when they were swallowed up by clouds, never to be seen again.

Not alive, at any rate.

Like an immortal fairy tale hero, Mallory resurfaced in 1999 when American climber Conrad Anker discovered his frozen body. In a remarkable bit of happenstance that makes museum curators tremble with excitement, all of Mallory's belongings had survived intact.

Except a photo of his wife Ruth, which the onetime schoolteacher had promised he would plant on the peak in her honor.

Anker spent several years pondering the ultimate mystery: Did Mallory make it to the peak after all?

Anker in 2007 attempted to answer that question - or at least, to walk in his hero's shoes - by retracing Mallory's route.

Anker wasn't fooling around: He and his partner, Leo Houlding, undertook the climb using replicas of clothing and equipment used in the 1920s.

Geffen weaves a beautiful tapestry in The Wildest Dream, chronicling the two climbs by combining video recording of the 2007 ascent, recently discovered footage from 1924, Irvine's diary notations, and the love letters Mallory wrote to his wife.

Narrator Liam Neeson keeps the pace going, while a team of actors, including Ralph Fiennes, the late Natasha Richardson (in her last film), Hugh Dancy, and Alan Rickman provide voices for the historical figures.

Herman Melville would have dug this film. Because at bottom, it's less about the epic struggle of human vs. nature, or the soaring ambitions of the human spirit than about obsession.

The man who created Moby Dick's tragic hero, Captain Ahab, would have understood the all-consuming, monomaniacal passion that drove Mallory toward the peak and what impelled Anker to duplicate that trip.",1474588800,,2214,5.220338983050848
