8179216,5,1897127286,"I stumbled across Tractor Ted while looking up tractor themed videos on youtube for my almost 2 year old son. He was instantly enthralled with footage of real, working farm equipment. It isn't often I come across a program made for children that isn't screamingly loud and fast paced and I was disheartened to find out that the DVDs I was seeing advertised were available only in the eastern hemisphere. Luckily for me, I came across a seller on amazon that sells the DVD's stateside. So far, we've watched Tractor Ted in Springtime - the other Tractor Ted DVDs I purchased are being saved for my son's up and coming birthday. Tractor Ted in Springtime is definitely a hit! And I love knowing that I can let him watch it without fear of developmental repercussions. Finally, something my son can watch that isn't loaded with previews, commercials, or bad attitudes for him to imitate! He isn't completely glued to the screen for the entire 40 minutes but he is obviously entertained for most of it, which is fine by me. It definitely holds his attention enough for me to get the dishes into the dishwasher or start supper or both. He loves watching the segment where they cut down a tree and it's taken to the sawmill for processing. There isn't a day that goes by were he doesn't ask to see them ""chop down the tree"" and ""sawmill!"" I love the fact that it's real, raw footage. It's obvious the ""actors"" are actual farmers going about their daily work. These aren't makeup wearing models in an idealized setting, these are real people doing real work. As a mom that doesn't feel entirely comfortable with what's on television for kids these days, I can definitely recommend Tractor Ted without reservation.",1327881600,2,1706,4.69
