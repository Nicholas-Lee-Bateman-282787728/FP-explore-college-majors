8554955,5,B00ANV6V4K,"I saw this on their website rather than on DVD, so I can't speak to the DVD itself. This is a great resource for parents or teachers who want to introduce kids to Shakespeare. The play is short to begin with, and they've edited this down to about an hour and a half. The voice acting is good, and the animation is great (the robots are actually ""acting"" to the material). I don't know what credentials the creators have, but they seem to know their Shakespeare.",1363132800,2,461,4.372093023255814
8554956,5,B00ANV6V4K,Great teaching tool for students who otherwise wouldn't be interested in learning about Shakespeare and the subtitles aid in ease of comprehension.,1362960000,,147,5.7272727272727275
8554957,4,B00ANV6V4K,"I got a link to this movie through an email chain.  I checked it out with my 6 year old in mind, figuring I should preview it before letting him watch it (he loves robots).  Turns out, it was pretty good.  The CGI looked good and the subtitles will really help him get a handle on the story.  From what I gathered from the email chain this was an indie movie.  Hats off to the filmmaker.  For an indie CGI movie about Macbeth, it looks good and the science fiction angle is fun.",1355529600,2,478,4.086021505376344
