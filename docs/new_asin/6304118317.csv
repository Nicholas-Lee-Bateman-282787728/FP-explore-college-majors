Too young, too young...though he had a certain craggy, rough-hewn quality to his face that made him seem older than he actually was. It's hard to imagine him as anything less than middle-aged, but apparently back in the '60s he was the lead singer in a rock band called the Rippers (!).

This films is based on a short story by Jack London (from his collection ""The Night Born"") which, in turn, was based on the real life story of a man named Joe Rivers, who London knew when he was living in El Paso during the Mexican Revolution. It was previously adapted as an English language film in 1952 called ""The Fighter,"" starring Richard Conte and Lee J. Cobb.

Though this film is a little slow moving at the beginning, it does have a powerful finish. Onscreen, time period the movie depicts is somewhat indeterminate - I guess it's the early 1900's..? That's when the original story is set. No cars are seen; there is a Victrola and an early model phone.

The plot revolves around a Mexican man whose family was killed in the Revolution. To help the cause, financially, he agrees to enter the boxing ring for a crack at the welterweight championship. The agreement he insists upon is winner take all. The boxing match, which takes place at about the last 20 minutes or so, is pretty realistic. If you are a boxing fan, it's almost worth watching just for that.

The film has some mild profanity and bloodletting - probably a 'PG' by today's standards. It's Spanish language only, though, so be a speaker or get someone to translate for you. It's worth it.",1375488000,,1635,4.494949494949495
