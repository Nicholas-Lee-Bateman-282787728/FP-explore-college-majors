8654941,5,B001F963BA,Mike Konik leaves me on the edge of my seat in this WWII thriller. He clearly steals the show from veteran actor Dirk Benedict. The only question remaining is why Mike hasn't landed more roles.,1523577600,,193,4.542857142857143
8654942,5,B001F963BA,"This film was fun to watch good acting and action. Story line was killer well done, only weak point and it was tiny was a special effect of a plane on fire. I say it's a must see if you like original storys and killer action.",1398470400,,225,3.9130434782608696

8654944,1,B001F963BA,"This is one of the worse movies I have seen in a long time. While the concept is good, the acting is very poor, no research was done since the costumes were way off as was the dates used. In the beginning the date was shown as June 3,1943 then June 4th and yet the following scenes depicted Pearl Harbor as just being bombed.  The actual WWII footage was the same and used over and over. It bounced all over with no flow.",1333843200,,421,4.072289156626506
