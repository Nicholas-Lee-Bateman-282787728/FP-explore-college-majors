8221930,1,B000W9TVR2,This is a very short overview of the Topkapi treasures.  I bought it as a gift and a remberance for my spouse after a visit to this amazing place and was sadly disappointed and even embarrased by the brevity of the content of this product.  You could see more about this amazing site by watching a travel show on TV.,1290124800,,316,4.25
8221931,1,B000W9TVR2,"The film lasts only ten minutes. It does not give an overview of the Harem, nor does it show the very beautiful doors of the Harem in detail. The fountains are mentioned, but not shown. I would have liked a view of an entire room, not just details, the same goes for the garden.
When I was at the Topkapi, I also saw an exhibit of china from the Ming period and many other gifts to the Sultans from kings and rulers of other continents. Very little is shown.
I was encouraged to buy the DVD by the four star review, but the review seems to have been for the palace itself, not the DVD.
This was supposed to be a gift for a friend, bought a month ago, but it's not worth the postage. The problem is that I was not aware (until today when I read the fine print) that it was 10 minutes short and not the usual 45-60 minutes I have come to expect of travel videos.",1238976000,,860,4.035087719298246
8221932,4,B000W9TVR2,"This palace is so unlike other Palaces you might see in Europe and yet it is filled with stuff those places could only copy.  This royal home is built around grand gardens as opposed to say French Chateaux which were surrounded by gardens. I hope to return sooner than later.
