8299227,5,B001EPJE7A,"And thrilling. A mere description-testing the Scarab Formula 1 car at Riverside Raceway-is hardly enough. This is a thrilling film featuring the car mounted cameras now used in every race broadcast.
But this was first. Even the Hollywood racing films of the period-The Racers, Johnny Dark, Viva Las Vegas-didn't use car mounted cameras.
Every racing fan should have this in their collection. It's a must. The footage of Reventlow getting out of shape and saving the spin is worth it alone.",1354320000,,489,5.049382716049383
