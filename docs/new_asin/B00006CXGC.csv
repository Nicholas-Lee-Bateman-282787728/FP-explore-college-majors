7967064,5,B00006CXGC,"This DVD is actually Steve and ""A PACKET OF THREE"". I already had a DVD of this concert and because of the Title bought it thinking it was another concert. Don't get me wrong, ""A PACKET OF THREE"" is a fantastic group and Marriott is at his best. When isn't he???????????? I saw ""Humble Pie"" in Baltimore, Md (1971?) with ""Spooky Tooth"" and ""Montrose"". All three bands KICKED ASS!!!!!!! I wrote this review because I wanted everyone to be aware of what it contained. Trust me it is still very much worth the money.",1356912000,2,513,4.468085106382978
7967065,2,B00006CXGC,"If you don't read the reviews beforehand you may be sorely disappointed with this video, as I was.  It shows a young Steve on the cover and doesn't mention when it was recorded, only when it was released.  What's inside is a different story.  The band sounds great, but alas, our poor Steve's voice is a mere shadow of what it was with SF and HP.  It sounds weak and forced and there is no attempt to ""shout"" anymore - he only seems to reach for the easy notes.  I thought from the photo it would be recordings from 10 years earlier.  It's too expensive for what you're getting...",1344556800,2,580,4.275229357798165
7967066,5,B00006CXGC,This is  the video of the lead singer of Humble Pie. It starts out with a conversation (in of course a pub)!!  He is very easy going and a fine interview. The music begins with his band at this time Packet of Three and they do a bang up job on stage. Very good camera work and sound,1200355200,4,282,3.8448275862068964
7967067,5,B00006CXGC,"This 1985 Show featuring Steve Marriott, Jerry Shirley, and Jim Leverton as The Packet of Three is an amazing example of how a live DVD should sound...live. Instead of sounding recorded strictly through the mixing boards, it sounds like a crowd mike may have been used as well, to capture the sound of the band live, from out in the audience. And the results are fantastic.

I really like Marriott's gritty, raspy and powerful vocal tone he had in the 80s, such as on the ""On to Victory"" and ""Go for the Throat"" albums. He is awesome on this DVD. Crank it up, and it's like being at the show. If you're a Marriott fan, this is a MUST HAVE. The song selection is great, including Humble Pie and Small Faces tracks, and Steve Marriott is a charismatic and captivating frontman, with a truly amazing presence and voice. The interview is very interesting as well. By this today!!",1145923200,11,875,4.537974683544304
7967068,4,B00006CXGC,"This DVD shows that matchless frontman Steve Marriott still in his prime, belting out some great tunes: Watcha Gonna Do About It, the classic All Or Nothing and others. Includes an interview as well, and a brief bio. Too bad he's no longer with us. How can you not love this man?",1081814400,18,279,4.384615384615385

AS WELL AS IT DID IT IN FILLMORE EAST",1048464000,4,90,3.789473684210526
7967070,5,B00006CXGC,"I was fortunate enough to catch the U.K.'s premier blues shouter fronting Humble Pie twice (The Capital Centre - April 10, 1980 and The Bayou - March 04, 1981). Steve and the boys torn it up in both the arena and the club. It just didn't matter. Sad to say, all 3 (Steve, The Cap Centre, and The Bayou) are now gone. The good news is that he (along with Jim Leverton and Jerry Shirley as The Packet Of Three) was captured live in '85 at the Camden Palace Theatre in London powering through a 9 song set that serves as an excellent record of the power of Marriott. R.I.P. Steve, you'll be sorely missed.",1046649600,27,602,4.243478260869566
7967071,5,B00006CXGC,"Excellent live show from the late, great, former Humble Pie and Small Faces frontman. This is a 1985 concert from Steve's Packet of Three band which was a power trio that toured Europe from 1983 to 1987. Steve along with Bassist Jim Leverton and former Humble Pie Drummer Jerry Shirley put on an excellent show that rocks from beginning to end. The video quality is excellent and the 5.1 mix is superb. The only negative is that concert clocks in at only about 47 minutes although there is a 15 minute interview with Steve also included. Sadly, Steve passed away in a house fire in 1991 at the age of 44 just as he was beginning to work with Peter Frampton to reform Humble Pie. After seeing this video I think you will agree that Steve was an extraordinary talent who is sadly missed. Songs: What Ya Gonna Do About It, Fool For A Pretty Face, Shame, Shame, Shame, All Or Nothing, Five Long Years, 30 Days In The Hole, I Don't Need No Doctor, Walking The Dog, and Tin Soldier.",1037059200,36,976,4.397790055248619
