2825728,5,B000PMFO3Q,I have all of Foyle's War either on DVD or Instant Videos. I love this series and can't wait for the next season.,1359590400,,113,3.9565217391304346
2825729,5,B000PMFO3Q,"This is a great series of BBC movies. Well written and well acted. I wasn't born at the time of the war so I can't definitively comment on the period costumes and scenery--but on the surface it looks well researched.

The quality of the video is not as good as more recent TV dramas, but it is good enough.",1357430400,,306,4.186440677966102
2825730,5,B000PMFO3Q,"This series went from 10/10 to 11/10.  I cannot really fathom what just happened, it should be impossible to exceed the level of brilliance from season 2 (or series 2 for those UK folks).  But the show I didn't think could be improved upon just raised the bar.

It seems there is a bit more nuanced cinematography, which helps with the show tremendously.  It's subtle, but it seems like there is more experience behind staging and shooting as well as the angles and close ups.  Perhaps the budget increased with this season and they got some more talent?

Acting has also gone from great to magnificent.  Micheal Kitchen is so dry yet believable in his modern (1940s) Sherlock Holmes style.  I love it when he pauses with his 'ummmmm', you know when he does that he's not buying what the other person is saying!  The main cast has also improved from Honeysuckle (yes, that's her name) to Anthony to Julian.  They are all terrific.  No longer is Foyle's son annoying, but he's suddenly human and the viewer starts to have compassion for him.

The series is set during WW2, and while the special effects shots of the bombings and such aren't much to look at, the crew has paid particular attention to every other detail.  This is history.  Even if you aren't too terribly interested in Foyle's cases, the effects of the war on the people in Hastings and beyond are believable and well portrayed with good accuracy.  I find myself fact checking quite often and the crew gets it right every time.

Foyle is like a WW2 Sherlock Holmes, and when he solves cases, the episode is usually over.  We often see him present some circumstantial evidence to the culprit and they confess.  But it works.  By that revelation, we are done with our viewing.  It's not Law and Order where the viewer follows the trial and verdict.  To wrap up the episode we just get the ""Yes I did it!"" effect.  And episodes are about 1 hour 40 minutes long, so each is like a movie in itself.

Along with Downton Abbey, this is one of the best British drama series I have seen in recent years.  It is free to watch for Amazon Prime subscribers.  I actually get the discs from my local library since it's more convenient.  But whatever you do, you should be watching this series.",1355961600,5,2244,4.533665835411472
2825731,5,B000PMFO3Q,This is one of the best mystery series on TV. Michael Kitchen is outstanding. Production values are exceptionally high and the storylines keep you guessing. I will end up buying all the seasons.,1343001600,,194,4.909090909090909
2825732,5,B000PMFO3Q,"I have seen all the seasons and it is simply the best. Period! The setting, the acting, the mysteries are all first rate.",1340496000,,121,4.304347826086956
2825733,5,B000PMFO3Q,"""FOYLE'S WAR: Sets 1-5"" presents British Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece. They outdid themselves. This ""War Years"" series of 19 feature-length episodes is now available as a set and thus a better price. Wow, 32 hours, of sure-to-please mystery/period drama.

It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed. It serves as a home-front view documentary of the English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front. This series begins in May, 1940 when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany. You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.

On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one. The combined perfection is ""jolly good show."" It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of ""Foyle's War."" You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.

Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England. His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two. I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot. Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb.

Foyle is assigned a female driver, ""Sam"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile. Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins ""Miss Congeniality"" of the 1940s decade.

Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines.
Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.

Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions. It is understood that Foyle will continue in a NEW post-war mystery suspense scheduled for perhaps a 2010 airing.
Closed Captioning provides for the hearing impaired and those of us who struggle with some British accents and slang. The set has cast filmographies on all the top regular and guest stars.

""FOYLE'S WAR"" is to British mystery what ""THE PALLISERS"" is to British political drama, OR what ""MONARCH OF THE GLEN"" is to Scottish Highland drama. After you've experienced Foyle's War, I recommend either of the other 2 series.

2825823,5,B000PMFO3Q,Great series based in England during WWII. A good period piece around the early 1940's. Staging and costumes are really good. Great history lesson that makes you feel as though you were living back at that time.  Everything was well done.,1474243200,,238,4.804878048780488
2825824,5,B000PMFO3Q,"Created by geniuses, acted by professionals. Kitchen is from the thespian school of minor gestures (like Gary Cooper who did it so well for those who remember). The acting is perfect for ""film"" closeups. He doesn't need grand gestures or ""posing."" Everything he is expressing comes through his eyes and his face. Marvelous! Pretty boy ""stars"" in American crime shows should take a  serious lesson. Let the camera and the writing do the work, not the make-up, the gimmicky hair, the gym-toned body. All the other actors in the show are also at a very high level (including the sets, the costumes, and the antique vehicles). Altogether, wonderful to get lost in. An hour and a half of pleasurable watching.",1473638400,,704,4.866666666666666

2825828,5,B000PMFO3Q,"Foyle's War has become a staple in my house.  It's a program my wife and I will watch together in either the early mornings before work (yes, we get up early enough to watch a 90 minute program and STILL get ready) or on the lazy weekend mornings before going out for breakfast.

Set in WWII embattled Hastings, England, Michael Kitchen plays Det. Superintendent Chief Christopher Foyle.  He seems to be the 20th Century Sherlock Holmes.  The man won't let go of a lead to solve a mystery.  Aided by his driver, Pte Samantha Stewart (the very striking Honeysuckle Weeks) and Detective Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), Foyle will do anything to find the answers to whatever comes across his desk.  The writing and acting are spectacular.  The set designs deserve praise as do all material props used in the program.

This is seriously good viewing.  But a word of warning, if you get involved in watching, you can kiss that 90 minutes goodbye.  You'll be stuck right where you're at.  And, in my mind, that's a damn good thing.",1472860800,,1023,4.659217877094972

If you suffer from ADD you probably won't like Foyle's War... while not slow moving it is deliberate in its plot and characters.  And speaking of plots, the main thread usually has a number of twists and turns and invariably there are a number of sub plots which at first seem unrelated and yet in the end, turn out to be essential elements of the main plot.

The time period and the culture portrayed are captured with great skill by the entire production company.  Most importantly, this series avoids turning the production into a mindless exercise in flag waving.  The war itself, and the lives of the characters touched by it, are not presented in such a way as to overwhelm the real story line in each individual episode.  There are heroic characters, but there are also cads and bounders, war profiteers, careless servicemen avoiding their responsibilities, thieves and murderers, in short, real people being real, with a war going on in the background.

It is a series of multiple meanings: historical, ethical, personal. I ended up learning more about WWII than I had in several  college history courses. It caused in me a complete attitude adjustment and a humble appreciation of my parents whose youth was lived during WWII.

Michael Kitchen, Foyle, has taken acting into Art.  With out saying a word his face, his expressions communicate feelings and thought.  His face continually expresses his humanity and his unshakeable integrity with finess.  His subtle, powerfully informed method for solving the puzzle human beings create, especially when human actions end in murder, succeeds.  He is an ideal, a moral compass in a flawed society.  He mirrors what we all want to be and especialy what we would like to find in our leaders.",1409961600,,637,5.076923076923077

2826048,5,B000PMFO3Q,"The title ""Foyle's War"" refers to World War II, in which the series is set.  Series 3 covers approximately late 1940 into 1941.  I watched most of this series and my husband watched them all--and loved them!  He is 'hooked' on this series.  Foyle is often a man of few words; but when he speaks, you know to pay attention. Even his most common one-word answer (""Right"") is said in ways that suggest the brain gears are turning.  Michael Kitchens knows how to use facial expressions to communicate well without words.  As Foyle, he is generally mild-mannered . . . until he must speak his one-two punch at the end to the perpetrator(s) of the crime; then he spills all the evidence leading him to his conclusion.  Unlike other British mystery series I've watched, FW contains more 'period' dialogue that sheds light on what life may have actually been like for Britishers during this era.",1408060800,,887,4.683870967741935

After working more than 20 years with  or law enforcement leaders, officers and staff it was refeshing, yet informative to witness a totally honest and honorable man dealing with local investigations from theft to murder and esponage.
Furthermore, Foyle's War not only opened my eyes to the hardships endured by those living in the English countryside during World War 2, but also the opinions of some English of America and American's during that time period.",1407369600,,553,5.010869565217392

The acting by Michael Kitchen in the title role is superb, and it gives good insight into what is was like for Brits to live their daily lives in a state of war on their soil.  Most episodes do not linger on the violence and gore that goes with the murders, and sex is usually implied rather than shown. One of our favorite series.",1405641600,,423,4.275

Beautifully scripted and filmed, with interesting 3-dimensional characters, the whole series could be a good thing for Americans of all ilks to watch. In horrid circumstances, it portrays how people with character keep their heads about them without disintegrating into spoiled brats. When I'm done, I'll probably wait a while and watch them all again.",1404777600,,642,5.242718446601942

2826202,5,B000PMFO3Q,"I have watched most of the Foyle series several times so I prefer to review them all together. Like all British drama
series, they are extremely well researched regarding time period details. Michael Kitchen is ideal for the Foyle role.
Outwardly he is a formidable adversary who appears unshakeable under pressure from difficult cases, or his
superiors. Foyle's hidden compassion for his son, and other good people in unfortunate situations, reveals itself in
those traumatic events, in a subtle but sincere manner. The other cast members do a fine job in their chosen roles.
The British people were almost stoic in attempting to live a normal life style during WWII. It was a means of survival
under very difficult, and unavoidable wartime situations and it was an effective morale booster. I do prefer the added
excitement of the wartime episodes but all of the episodes are equally entertaining and well done. I highly recommend
this outstanding series to anyone who enjoys watching a top notch detective who performs his job with passion.",1404518400,,1043,5.069767441860465

2826249,5,B000PMFO3Q,"This series is fascinating as it gives a glimpse of WWII Britain through the eyes of the villagers of Hastings. While a series of murders or mysterious actions takes place, Detective Foyle interacts with many of the players in the war effort, including military and intelligence operations. Michael Kitchen is brilliant as the patient, calm but decisive Foyle. It takes a few episodes to really get into the series, and the characters develop along the way, but it is an excellent, intelligent, entertaining series.",1404086400,,515,5.142857142857143

This season series gives insight to the difficulty of inserting large number of troops and bases into the British countryside and the effects on the lives of the local people. Michael Kitchen, with his usual charm, is in the middle and has to deal with the complaints of the locals and the needs of the military. Gives personality to the lament of the British in having so many American soldiers on their soil...""over paid, oversexed, and over here"".......",1403827200,,569,4.876288659793815

Michael Kitchen's portrayal of the main character, a sensitive, private and sometimes reluctant Chief Inspector is subtle and convincing. Honeysuckle Weeks  as his driver Samantha (Sam) Stewart and Anthony Howell as Sergeant Milner stand out in their own right and the three together help to bring events in the little town of Hastings and the world at war that surrounds it into immediate and compelling focus. It resonates with those who lived through the World War II years and gives those of us who did not an idea of what it must have felt like to be there.",1403481600,,658,4.875

2826314,5,B000PMFO3Q,"Foyle's War was recommended to me by a friend who appreciates complexity of plot and subtlety in acting. It offers both of those in an interesting presentation, but for those who enjoy the personal aspects of history, it also offers a view that was previously unknown to me of life in England during WWII. Issues of war profiteering, secret plans to affect the psychology of the war, and the shortages of routine food items, plus the usual issues of trauma, fear, and loss, make this crime drama exceptional, in my estimation. The lead actor, Michael Kitchen, in the character of Foyle, is a master at communicating through facial expression alone, and is very believable in his handling of the role. Watching requires paying attention, as it is not overacted, but my wife and I have found the show to be a very rewarding experience.",1402444800,,833,4.791666666666667

It's a different perspective on WWII, and it rings very true.  Foyle is terrific, and the writing for his part in particular is excellent.  He's not long on words, and conveys much with an eyebrow or slight grimace.  When he does speak, every word counts.  Supporting characters are very good as well.",1396396800,,421,4.845070422535211
2826445,5,B000PMFO3Q,"We really have enjoyed this series.  The first one gave us some insight into the way it was in Britain just before and into the early years of WWII.  The intrigue, Political Scene, Greed and Murder seem to be just as prevalent in Britain as it was during the war in the US.  Very entertaining.",1396396800,,293,4.290909090909091

2826453,4,B000PMFO3Q,"Fun to see the who done it show based in England during WW2. Kinda plays off the idea of what swindles and crimes were effected at that time. For those of us living WW3 times in USA it brings back some of the same memories of rationing, metal, and fat collection. Some of the characters were allowed leniency in the mysteries so they could go serve. Plots were all over the place so hard to jump ahead to the villian(s). Only difficulty for this observer is the accent is thick and words trail off in volume at the ends of sentences so there is some guessing as to what was said.",1395705600,,579,4.225225225225225
2826461,5,B000PMFO3Q,Series 3 of Foyle's War lives up to the great levels of quality established in Series 1 and 2. There's never a dull moment! Amazon Instant Video makes it very convenient to catch up with this great series whether I'm at home or on the road.,1395705600,,240,4.239130434782608

2826464,5,B000PMFO3Q,"This is a very interesting detective series with close details of the period.  Foyle is like a subtle Columbo.  Since we were fans of Columbo, my husband and I enjoy Foyle's intelligence, wit and smoothness.  His sidekick brings in a lot of humor to an otherwise serious mystery.",1395446400,,279,4.770833333333333

2826469,5,B000PMFO3Q,I love this show and I'm so happy to be able to get it on Prime.  I've always been interested in WW11 (perhaps because I was born during it) and you see all the propaganda showing how everyone pulled together and how well all the troops got along and how cleverly our war departments defeated Hitler.  Foyle's War shows some of the real truths that happened during the war and our prejudices and real feelings.  Not to say people didn't pull together but it wasn't quite as simple and we were made to think.  This series shows the sorrow and loss that real people endured and the worry that is usually glossed over.  There were criminals even during the war and someone upstanding had to deal with them and Mr. Foyle fits that bill.,1394755200,,732,4.432835820895522

2826481,5,B000PMFO3Q,I have watched the first three seasons and am just beginning the fourth. Foyle's War is the finest series I have seen in years. Michael Kitchen and the rest of the British cast are brilliant. The stories will keep you guessing right up until the end.,1394755200,,250,4.456521739130435

2826487,4,B000PMFO3Q,I love shows that are period pieces. The fact that this series is in the 1940's and in England fascinated me. I was surprised with the knowledge that a lot of the British were angry with the Americans for taking their time entering the war and some really didn't want us there? This series has a lot of twists and turns and is very interesting to watch.,1394236800,2,353,4.2835820895522385

Because we have the entire series, from year one, to watch, we look forward to seeing the next episode almost EVERY night.  I don't know what we'll do when we've watched the entire series.  I guess we'll have ""withdrawals"" and hope we find another series that is just as interesting and, yes, educational.",1394150400,,426,4.875
2826489,5,B000PMFO3Q,Chief Detective Foyle reminds me so much of the former Colombo series that I liked so much with actor Peter Faulk.  Both were/are laid back and uncanny in their ability to get to the truth of the crime.  Mr. Floye does not let the political correctness of his time (the 40's) or higher ranking authority stop him from getting at the truth.  Godfrey Cernyar,1394064000,,356,4.53125

2826508,4,B000PMFO3Q,"This will be the role for which Michael Kitchen will be remembered. The stories are so thoroughly character-driven that we wind up unable to imagine the war and the constabulary without thinking of Foyle's character. I think he has redefined the archetype, a measure which alone makes this series worth viewing. Be sure to include a study of how his driver also defines the new British woman. I can't think of anything more important to understanding the cultural change the war brought to English society.",1393027200,,506,4.964705882352941
2826509,5,B000PMFO3Q,When it comes to who done it. The BBC knows how to solve murder without shoot outs and naked body everywhere. Good story lines and plain old fashion clues deliver wonderful stories with trully inspired plots,1392940800,,207,4.777777777777778

The plot moves all over in this multifaceted series....not as fast and flashy as the every night major network programming.  I guess we all find our comfort zones and we've settled into this one.  We like it.,1392854400,,331,4.377049180327869

2826516,5,B000PMFO3Q,"I have almost finished watching this whole series of WW II mysteries.  These stories aren't your normal ""who done it."" The setting is the southern coast of England during the war.  Characters must learn to live without-without sweets, without petrol, without meat. Through all the sacrifices, there is still crime.  I am always surprised by ""who done it"" but never by the quality of acting.  It is always superb.  I can highly recommend this series.....all the episodes are wonderfully engaging.",1392681600,,495,5.1375
2826517,5,B000PMFO3Q,It really doesn't get any better than this.  I am not a murder mystery fanboy and only watched a more recent episode because my wife was watching it and I had nothing better to do.

2826521,5,B000PMFO3Q,This show gives a well balanced view of the problems England had during the Second World War. The attitude that there's a war on and ordinary laws shouldn't matter is something the main character has to battle both from his superiors and the perpetrators.,1392422400,,255,4.818181818181818
2826522,5,B000PMFO3Q,This is one of the best series I've seen.  Each episode keeps you in suspense with a possibility of different suspects. Michael Kitchen does a wonderful job and is backed-up by a great supporting cast.  Terrific!,1392249600,,212,4.861111111111111

2826524,5,B000PMFO3Q,I have enjoyed every episode of Foyle's War. Michael Kitchen makes a very thoughtful detective kept in the police force although he wants to be in the army. The cast is strong and the program also provides me with a little insight into Britain early in World War II.,1392163200,,266,4.448979591836735
2826525,4,B000PMFO3Q,"I missed the first few seasons of Foyle's War, so the opportunity to catch up on them is much appreciated.

He has a presence in the scenes he's in. He's layed back  easy to watch. The roles he plays seem to be in movies that are fairly clean. He doesn't have to say much, his facial expressions tell it all. I've throughly enjoyed all the Foyle's War episodes. The plots are good and the actors are exceptional. The plots have a British slant and it's interesting to see the war from that point of view.",1391990400,,555,4.235849056603773

2826547,5,B000PMFO3Q,"Foyle's War combines great history, acting and writing. World War II is one of the most written about periods in history. However, we seldom get the view of the every man. Even less, the every woman. This series gives us their point of view within a very entertaining mystery solved by a quite decent and bright detective. The series does not depend on the cliche to keep us entertained. It provides characters human and flawed, but not so much so that they unbalance a storyline rich in historic detail. A delightfully entertaining piece of fiction with the right measure of a period that still influences our lives.",1391990400,,617,4.775700934579439

Honeysuckle Weeks as his driver is cute but I can see her role expanding in the future.  I don't remember offhand who plays SGT Milner but he also does a good job.  The only concern I continue to have is some of the character actors have heavy accents and it takes a lot of concentration to figure out what they are saying.  When that happens I tend to miss something which follows but, thanks to this being on-line it's easy to back it up and catch what I've missed.",1391040000,,627,4.417391304347826

The plots are intricate and interesting, not to mention dealing with the truths of those times. You won't find a better look at war torn Britian and the normal everyday life therein.

2826582,5,B000PMFO3Q,I really enjoy this series.  I lived through WWII .  I never knew much about how life was for the British.  I think life was very difficult for them.  I just wish I could get Closed caption.,1390953600,,190,4.054054054054054
2826593,5,B000PMFO3Q,"Production and screen-play values are consistantly high. Kitchen remains a joy to watch: he is never acting; every twitch of his mobile face is organic, grows brilliantly from his profound reactions to his immediate, yet grounded world.",1390867200,,236,5.405405405405405
2826594,5,B000PMFO3Q,"All of the Foyle's War programs have been extremely well done.  As the war progresses, new problems beset the British people, and they are very well protrayed in this program.",1390867200,,175,4.833333333333333

2826596,5,B000PMFO3Q,Michael Kitchen does an wonderful job as the chief detective.  The series is well written and characters well developed. You never know who will be caught in the end.  I love the time period of the 1940's during WWII in England and once I started watching the first series I haven't stopped.  They just keep getting better.,1390867200,,323,4.631578947368421
2826597,4,B000PMFO3Q,"My husband and I really like watching Foyle's War. It is not only a good mystery show but the clothing, cars and houses from the forties wartime era are really authentic and it makes the war era come to life. The actors are terrific. The only complaint I have is that the shows are not close captioned and I figure I miss at least 20% of the dialogue because of the accents.",1390867200,,374,4.208333333333333

2826599,5,B000PMFO3Q,"If your looking for a different type detective series and your interested in history particularly WWI, then this show gives you just what your looking for.  As an American I don't think we really understood what the British and other European countries went through during this war and this show gives you that understanding by putting you in their shoes and while all that is going on there are still people committing lawless acts, murder and treason! You'll never guess ""Who dun it"" and why all while your learning about the strength and strategies of the British during that terrible time. I love watching Foyle and can't get enough....",1390521600,,640,4.871559633027523

These remain ordinary people despite their extraordinary circumstances struggling with their shortcomings. There are no larger-than-life heroes  here. Refreshing.",1389657600,,396,5.6
2826632,5,B000PMFO3Q,We are just tired of US Network TV with all of the commercials and simple content.  Foyle's War combines historical and cultural content with a sophisticated plot.,1389657600,,163,5.037037037037037

Supported by Honeysuckle Weeks, Anthony Howell and well written stories, he leads all the Foyle's War series into unfolding exciting stories about the extremely difficult experiences of the English citizens in and around the town of Hastings during WWII. Murders,fiery bombings, deceptions, arrogance, disastrous incompetence and more make this series exciting and definitely worth watching.  The only downside is the overly long monologues of grieving people.  Anthony Horowitz, let up on the attempts to elicit sad feelings from your viewers.",1389484800,,593,5.793103448275862
2826647,4,B000PMFO3Q,I enjoy the Foyle's War Series immensely The twists and turns and how the trio figure it all out.  I also enjoy the window into life in England during WW II in the country rather than in the larger cities like London.,1389484800,4,217,4.166666666666667

2826652,5,B000PMFO3Q,Excellent.  I could usually figure out plots and clues but few keeps me guessing right up to the end.  Like the characters and likenesses shown.  Not just about the war and evils but about folks reaction to evils and their choices.,1389225600,,231,4.585365853658536

I've grown to like Folye's War, and to keep up with the characters (Foyle, Sam, and the assistant whose name I can't recall, but identify him as the veteran who lost his leg in Norway.  I also enjoy the period history.  I'm into series three now and enjoy them as much as the others I've seen.  It's like putting on an old, comfortable pair of shoes.",1388534400,,527,4.23

2826743,5,B000PMFO3Q,"The entire series is among the best I have ever seen on television.  It is history on a personal level.  How must have the English felt facing a real possibility of invasion as was shown in the early episodes?  Each episode is a morality play underlying a murder mystery.  The characters are amazing from the clear-eyed and perfect main character Chief Detective Christopher Foyle, his young and idealistic driver Samantha Stewart and Foyle's assistant the good but not quite perfect Paul Milner.  The episode touches on important themes.  Among them were English Nazi sympathizers, racism, disabled veterans, black marketing, profiteering and American soldiers in England.  Each is far more interesting than my description.  It is well worth ones time.",1388188800,,753,5.26890756302521

2826763,5,B000PMFO3Q,I stumbled on this show when searching for a series that had a long run.  I admit that I didn't know that much about World War II as it was in Europe and this series paints an excellent picture of the every day lives of those who lived through it.  It is a murder mystery of sorts but it is much more about the people and the hardships of war.  I continue to watch and will be sad when it comes to an end.,1387670400,,405,3.7976190476190474

2826949,4,B000PMFO3Q,"Protagonist is subtle, and a delightful change from standard American crime dramas.  Added bonus, the Brits allow their story to unfold over an hour and a half.

2826957,5,B000PMFO3Q,My wife and I both love this whole series.  The beautiful photography and great acting are hard to resist.  Some episodes may be a little slow moving for some people.,1376697600,,166,4.5
2826958,5,B000PMFO3Q,An excellent enthralling series made so by an ensemble that just makes it happen in what seems such an easier manner.

2826981,5,B000PMFO3Q,"This is an interesting show. Love the characters. It's rare when we are able to figure out ""who done it"" before the end of the show.",1376352000,,132,4.115384615384615
2826982,5,B000PMFO3Q,"If you haven't watched any of the Foyle's War series and love history esp the WW2 era, then I highly recommend this show.",1376352000,,121,4.304347826086956
2826983,5,B000PMFO3Q,Really great series!  The acting is very good and the period settings are well done. The dialogue is full of ridiculous anachonisms but it doesn't spoil the show.,1376179200,,162,4.785714285714286

2826991,5,B000PMFO3Q,"Does it really matter that everything takes place in the prewar-war torn UK? I think not, this is procedural crime solving at its best. The characters feel real and as the series progresses, one becomes involved with them and what transpires in their lives. I was hesitant at first, I grew up listening to my father's ""war stories"" and saw almost every WWII TV show/documentary/movie ever made during the 50s and 60s. I really didn't want to see more of the same. This is very different, its about people, well one man, Christopher Foyle, and what happens in his life while he masterfully solves crimes. You can watch his process while he solves the current mystery (the UK, especially in the small villages, is rife with murder it seems) all the while trying to do his bit in the war effort. If you like well-acted British crime drama, try it.",1375228800,,844,4.633333333333334

Foyle is real, down to earth, intelligently thoughtful, and a real man.",1370563200,,301,4.537037037037037

Michael Kitchen does a wonderful job as the WWII Detective, and all of the supporting characters/actors are splendid as well.

2827047,5,B000PMFO3Q,"National American networks should do this type of programing in place of the reality TV programing.  The series has character and depth never found in networks other than PBS. The individuals cast are quality actors, each one matures with the series. Michael Kitchen as an actor is top notch and his charactor has a professional police side and a very human side as he relates to his son, his dead wife, and his personal interactions with all cast members.  He is a policemans' ideal image of what a chief investigator and leader of constabulary should be and is therefore prototipical.",1370217600,,586,4.85
2827048,5,B000PMFO3Q,"I have been watching the Foyle's War series for years and I found Series 3 to be excellent.  Foyle's War isn't the traditional crime drama that one sees in the U.S. (ex:CSI) where viewers are exposed to a lot of gore and extreme violence.  Some episodes show the crime, but it is done tastefully (so young people can view the show).  The series is set in WWII and focuses on how a police inspector solves murders and other crimes during that time period.  Between the costuming, the acting and the story lines, this is a very entertaining series to watch.  I love that Series 3 has continued to uphold the quality like that of Series 1 and 2.  Additionally, the writers have allowed the characters to continue to grow in their roles.  Since Amazaon doesn't list the four episodes on all their venues, here is a quick list of season 3:
1. The French Drop,
2. Enemy Fire,
3. They Fought in the Fields,
4.  A War of Nerves

Note: if you buy the Acorn DVD's, check them carefully. Acorn has a habit of cutting scenes from episodes which is why I prefer to buy the Amazon online British television version.",1370131200,,1101,4.437810945273632

2827064,5,B000PMFO3Q,Each episode of this series is well done and interesting. I am hooked on this series and am dreading it ending. The actors are superb. The casting could not have been better.

He and his sidekick, along with his driver (the very comely Honeysuckle Weeks), solve murders and take down the pretenders in society.

There is so much detail in the settings, that it makes me want to pause and look at it again. The plots show so much imagination. Although we are able to predict how some parts to the story will come around, there is always at least one twist that surprises all of us. The best part, though, are the characters.

He says so much with his shrugs and facial expression. Honeysuckle Week as his driver and Anthony Howel as his wounded ex vet whose well enough to get through the trials of it with aplomb.

Imagine watching a movie about Daniel Boone and having the story line be about eastern city people concerned that Daniel's walks in the woods could lead to people moving out of the city and reducing the tax base. It just wouldn't work and it would convince you that the writer of the movie was trying to promote some agenda.

8192632,5,B000PMFO3Q,"This PBS Masterpiece Theatre Mystery series features Michael Kitchen, who gives a beautifully nuanced, bravura performance as Deputy Chief Superintendent (DCS) Christopher Foyle. It takes place in the southern coastal town of Hastings in Sussex, England during World War II. While war is raging, DCS Foyle goes about the business of solving murders. Most seem to relate in some way to the war effort, which makes the series that much more interesting.

This is a period drama, and it most definitely maintains an authenticity of time and place. In this regard alone, it  succeeds brilliantly. It has none of the artificial, highly stylized Hollywood type sense of what the period should look like. Rather, all is as it should be. Everyone looks perfectly natural and comfortable in their period clothing and setting. The setting really does harken one to wartime England, and the social mores of the time are observed. This period drama most assuredly gives the viewer a sense of what life  must have been like during that dark and troubling  time.

The supporting cast is terrific, overall. Most notable, however, is Honeysuckle Weeks, who plays the role of Samantha Stewart, a vicar's daughter and Foyle's young driver. She infuses the role with an innate wide-eyed innocence and infectious enthusiasm. The very handsome and talented Julian Ovenden is superbly cast as Doyle's son, Andrew, a Royal Air Force pilot. Anthony Howell is also excellent as Sergeant Paul Milner, a disabled war veteran who returns to police work, assisting DCS Foyle with his investigations. There is no doubt, however, that Michael Kitchen, with his understated and brilliant performance, is the star of the show.

There are four episodes in season three, all of which are well-written and very enjoyable.  There are a total of nine seasons. So, if one  enjoys season three, there are six more, all of which I am binge watching, as I love this show.",1490227200,,1929,5.044025157232705
