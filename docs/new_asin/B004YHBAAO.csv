It's essentially chronological and focuses on selected, representative works. One thing to note is the narration is in German - which I had not realized - but all the interviews are in English. English, French, German and Spanish subtitles are optional choices on the DVD. There are no extra features on the DVD. As I have used this as part of a music class, one of the best things is the length of the music played by the RSOF. These are the DVD chapters [with my comments/attempt to summarize each section]: 1. Fanfare for the Common Man [complete performance with interesting camera angles and staging, 2. Hoe-Down from Rodeo [almost all of the music], 3. Childhood and Youth in Brooklyn, 4. Musical education and composing [goes to Paris, studies with Nadia Boulanger], 5. Third Symphony, Mahler's influence [Mahler's influence is really only a passing reference, although I suppose you can hear influence in the orchestration in the example played], 6. Pep and zip, the American style of music, 7. Clarinet Concerto, with Benny Goodman [footage of Benny Goodman playing with Copland conducting], 8. Life and work in New York City [Copland moves around a lot, composes a number of significant pieces in room 1040 in the Empire Hotel], 9. Appalachian Spring, Ballet for Martha [interesting commentary from Copland about formation of this piece], 10. Copland's Philosophy of life [McCarthyism is mentioned along with the fact that some of Copland's works were banned at this time], 11. Lincoln Portrait, conducted by Leonard Bernstein [archive performance of a part of the work], 12. Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson, musical poetry [Copland, after writing mostly instrumental music, finds Emily Dickinson; sections performed by Stella Doufexis & RSOF], 13. El Salon Mexico, travel around the world [Copland went anywhere he was asked, promoted travel], 14. Connotations, a new Copland sound [written for the opening of the Lincoln Center, Hugh Wolff suggested it was not a hit with JFK, or anyone else], 15. Artistical testimony, 16. End credits.",1314489600,14,2626,5.684478371501272
