6365973,5,B00JKE4W6A,"I love Mrs's browns boys TV show so had to get the movie when it was available, it is not as funny as show, but it goes more in depth into the Brown family and still has the bloopers like they do in the show as well as the bawdy humor.  Love it!",1416355200,7,245,3.6226415094339623
6365974,5,B00JKE4W6A,"Quick ship.  Can't play movie on my DVD, but am able to watch on computer.  Good movie.",1416268800,2,87,4.0588235294117645
6365975,4,B00JKE4W6A,"I liked the movie, but without the laugh tracks it's missing the ""audience participation"" that the tv show has.  It had a great story line and the music was great.  I really like how they included some of the actors/characters who aren't on the show now.  I did miss ""Mick"" though.",1415491200,2,281,4.470588235294118
6365976,5,B00JKE4W6A,As an American who thankfully discovered Mrs. Brown's Boys and who owns all the dvds so far I must say I really enjoyed this movie. Was it an Oscar winner? Of course not but it was sweet and silly and at one point brought a tear to my eye. I love Mrs. Brown's Boys and if you are a big fan give this movie a try.,1414540800,12,312,3.742424242424242
6365977,1,B00JKE4W6A,"Oh what a horrible movie... with that being said, yes, I was a fan of the tv series. So I'm not just someone saying the movie has to be as bad as the tv show even tho I never saw it... nope, I loved Mrs Browns Boys the TV show from day 1 of the BBC series. When I heard there was movie being made, I got a little excited and couldn't wait to see it. I saw it being advertised as coming soon at the theatres... and the next thing I see is it's available for rental on DVD... I missed it being in theatres... which made me think, if I didn't see it advertised on TV or whatnot, does that mean it had a short and unprompted release in theatres for a reason?

Yes, it did. The film opens up decently, with a few laughs, much like the show does. In fact it looks just like the show, then you see why and it breaks out into a stupid musical number. The musical number was not funny in anyway, and had me scratching my head why they would bother to film this and make people watch it? Unfortunately, it sets up the movie too. Mrs Brown has apparently always worked in a fruit stall in town. (Where was that in the TV show?) and a few stalls are closing down. It turns out someone is buying out the stalls so he can build a shopping mall. Oh how the plot thickens. Mrs Browns stall is targeted next, and she finds herself in legal trouble having to pay off a debt her great grandmother owed. Now the rest of the movie is a cat and mouse chase when it's not locked in a court room battle. You can predict the ending and everything else that goes on to get there. Which takes too damn long. The jokes in the beginning where that of the Mrs Browns Boys style, but after that, it all goes down hill and there is hardly a worthy chuckle.

Also, the film is called Mr's Browns Boys... apart from a small few almost cameo like appearances, the boys are hardly in the film. It should have involved them more, otherwise just call it ""Mrs Brown and Dermits Friend... and a bit of Rory"". The entire movie failed to make any of its marks, and in the end, it's just a dragged out episode of the series that lost touch with the comedy aspect and tried too hard to go for feeling and emotion which is just eye rolling and painful to watch as the end of the movie goes out the way it started.",1414281600,10,2268,4.048997772828508

The movie is not as funny as the television series, but it still has some great moments.
