2892786,5,B000T28PG0,"If you ever wanted to explore all the hidden places in the world or are amazed that people actually lived under the cities as we know them, get this series.  I couldn't stop watching them and learned so much about our history.  Great to watch alone or with another history geek.  Heck, call me and I'll come watch them again with you!",1216166400,5,334,4.354838709677419
2892787,5,B000T28PG0,"I've always been fascinated by abandoned underground settings, the older, the better.  ""Cities of the Underworld"" is a dream come true, especially the material on Rome and Paris.  Not only does the series get access to these sites, but also knowledgeable guides and excellent lighting.  This really is ""Must See TV!""",1210032000,3,316,5.1568627450980395
2892788,5,B000T28PG0,These are very very interesting and very educational.  I would recommend these to everyone!!!,1206662400,,93,5.642857142857143
2892789,5,B000T28PG0,"From the first time I saw the episode trailer I was hooked; it makes you long for more. Sometimes I feel like fewer suspenseful replays would allow for more information to be inserted and that is probably my only complaint. However the host is a bit self-centered and annoys us. I think they were concerned with the cool/hip image of him to attract younger viewers, but he is annoying.

I look for the series to be awarded some recognition for their ability to document historical places which have never before been aired on television. Sadly, most are old, and crumbling and are not being preserved. SO the value of this series is truly priceless. Still each time I see a new episode it renews my enthusiasm to travel to Europe some day. This is a hit, and would be a great program to incorporate into any school-based curricila. Well done.

I am buying one to give as a gift to someone who does not have access to the History Channel. Thank you for instilling a passion and interest for history into my kids. I never though it would happen.",1205539200,5,1043,4.5132275132275135
2892790,3,B000T28PG0,"This series was worth it overall - a couple of cities had less material than others and got repetitive, but some were really interesting. Budapest was great until they tried to make you feel bad for the Nazi sympathizers.

The host tried too hard to be ""cool."" Thought he was in an action movie or something. Seemed to be overcompensating for a deep-seated hatred of his mother.",1202860800,3,378,4.641791044776119
2892791,5,B000T28PG0,Saw the features on TV. Ordered 2 and gave 1 as a gift. Very good response since we are going to these cities and not many know of this secret.,1202428800,4,143,3.8
2892792,5,B000T28PG0,"I haven't finish watching it, but I love it! I learned a lot, my family enjoy it as well. Good price, good buy.",1200268800,3,111,3.869565217391304
2892793,3,B000T28PG0,"This is a fascinating topic but the coverage of each city seems so incomplete! For example, the episode on NYC doesn't even mention the mole people. How can they talk about what goes on under NYC without even a single word about the thousands of people who live underground?! Perhaps the folks at the History Channel made a decision to leave the viewer wanting more, but I think they should have committed to two episodes (or three or four) for most cities. I also wonder why the city of Portland, Oregon is included in this set when there are so many cities around the world with more interesting stories to tell. It seems out of place in this series: London, Paris, Edinburgh, Rome, Naples, Budapest, Berlin... and Portland, Oregon?!? What were they thinkin'? And the two hosts of the show are less than stellar -- Eric Geller refuses to step aside to let us enjoy the footage of caves, sunken cities, lost art, and long forgotten worlds. He's always front and center, over-enthusiastically saying something either obvious or stupid. The second host, Don Wildman, is distracting with his constant ""Oh my God!"" and bleeped out swearing. (This shows poor editing -- if Don can't contain himself, why bleep the offending words rather than just removing them?) I'm not sure why the History Channel went with these ""regular guy"" hosts rather than someone more educated and/or credible, perhaps someone with more reverence for ancient artifacts, early engineering and architecture, and an understanding of their place in history. But despite my many criticisms, all in all, this is a great series based on the concept and footage (hats off to the cameraman!), and I think most people would find it interesting and educational. I certainly learned a lot about world history from this series and I am eager to do some reading to learn more.",1199664000,44,1834,4.862619808306709
2892794,5,B000T28PG0,"We watched this on History Channel and got ""hooked"". These are the most fascinating places that I never would have known about! Would be great for kids too...",1198886400,3,158,4.678571428571429
2892795,1,B000T28PG0,"The hosts are grating, some shows have more filler than substance, and they make claims that aren't backed up very convincingly.  Add to that the lack of an anamorphic picture, and this is a series that people should just avoid.",1391904000,,228,4.7
2892796,3,B000T28PG0,This was a series that was easy to get hooked on. Interesting mix of past and present.  The host's antics really adds to the show also.,1384214400,,135,4.1923076923076925
2892797,5,B000T28PG0,Love this type of stuff. Wish their was more. Will be getting more in the future. Everyone must take time in trying new & different things in life.,1380326400,,147,4.285714285714286
2892798,4,B000T28PG0,"I'm interested in this sort of thing, true it does not come from a scientific approach but it's entertaining none the less.",1379635200,,123,4.636363636363637
2892799,5,B000T28PG0,"The host of this show will crawl into any sized space LOL, being claustrophobic, this show allows me to see whats down there ha-ha. Got it for my husbands birthday he is a huge fan of this series.",1374364800,,196,4.184210526315789
2892800,4,B000T28PG0,"this is the most fascinating documentary series I have seen in a long time. It is amazing the we can go where no man has gone before, for hundreds and sometimes thousands of years with  'access all areas'.
The reason I knocked off a star is that I found the rapid camerawork and fast cutting VERY annoying. And the presenter is so  'in your face' as he rapidly hurries around as if things are going to change in the next few minutes.  This terrific programme is crying out for a Michael Palin or Tony Robinson to take control of the narration and do it properly.  Also, and this is a big gripe, someone tell all American narrators that it is not  ""Edinboro"" !!!  As a Scot, I was horrified. Can they not do basic research ?
Camerawork and narration aside, this is a superb look into history and it is very hard not to watch it several times. Enjoy going underground and overlook the faults. Highly recommended.",1373241600,,910,4.419161676646707
2892801,5,B000T28PG0,"this show was very intresting.
I love this type of show
the show was very informing
it was fun, funny and informing",1364428800,,115,4.2727272727272725
2892802,5,B000T28PG0,What a great show. We had never seen it when originally broadcast and we're enjoying it now. Hope the series continues.,1362960000,,119,4.714285714285714
2892803,5,B000T28PG0,Thoroughly enjoy this series. Eye-opening information on all underground cities no one knew about! Highly recommend this DVD as well as the whole series.,1358812800,,153,5.416666666666667
2892804,4,B000T28PG0,"I just needed the one show about Vesuvius, so that one was good.  Graphics were great, but bird's eye view of geography went too fast.  I would have liked to have purchased just the one show, not the entire season, but thank you for making at least that one available.",1354320000,,268,4.34
2892813,5,B000T28PG0,we loved watching this series! My son likes to watch them over and over again. we will be buying the rest of series soon.,1349654400,,121,4.083333333333333
2892814,5,B000T28PG0,"I have all 3 seasons minus the missing episodes.  The hosts were great, Eric Geller is the better of the two. I am glad they didn't have some snobby university professor host the show, it would made it less exciting and more classroom like. Eric and Don were more real and down to earth! Eric 5 stars! Don 4.5 stars! Series 5+ stars.",1344556800,,333,4.285714285714286
2892815,5,B000T28PG0,"The host(s) make no pretense of knowing more than they think they do and that's refreshing for a start. The other thing that's refreshing is their sheer enthusiasm for the places they visit. You really get a sense of being there with them. Having said that, the Portland episode and the Hitler's bunkers episode were the least interesting to me, I loved the Paris Catacombs, Turkey and Istanbul episodes the most. I laughed like a hyena at the host's enthusiasm to get into a rubber dinghy and go underneath the foundations of a school in search of Justinian's circus in Istanbul, that was awesome, and I wish he'd gone further. Overall, this is a wonderful series that shows the amazing ingenuity of the human mind and that no matter how far we think we've come with our science and technology, our forefathers were just as creative and inventive as we are today. I'd recommend this show to anyone with a love of history or things that are hidden underneath our cities.",1311292800,4,970,4.678362573099415
2892816,4,B000T28PG0,"we love the show but I am seriously irritated by my inability to find the theme song, title, or artist.",1310515200,,103,4.2
2892817,5,B000T28PG0,A great show if you have traveled to large cities you should see what you can't underground it will thrill you. Amazon was great to work with.,1305590400,,142,4.296296296296297
2892818,5,B000T28PG0,I got this for my dad for Christmas and I think he's really going to enjoy it.  It was delivered in pristine condition and on time!,1261958400,,131,4.038461538461538
2892819,5,B000T28PG0,"I own this set and love it! It's very informative and offers interesting history highlights, without bogging it down with too much information.  I love the places that the hosts go to in this season!  My favorite episode was on Dracula...fascinating!",1242691200,,250,5.073170731707317
2892820,5,B000T28PG0,"I recently saw this program on the History Channel. They are currently screening series 3. I liked the show so much I wanted to see the past ones, so I picked up this season 1 box set. It is great value as you get many episodes, each about 40 minutes long. Who would know what lies beneath our cities?? My favorite episode on this season was probably Paris. This is very educational and a great resource to keep in your DVD collection.

Half way through the season they switch presenters from Eric Geller to Don Wildman. I personally prefer Don Wildman. Throughout the whole time watching it, I liked Don Wildman's jacket. I managed to track it down to an Abercromie Sentinel jacket and ordered one for myself online.

I have my pre-order in for season 2 now..",1233878400,5,760,4.5
2892821,1,B000T28PG0,"I bought this series at the Strand for about $10. Simply put, it's bad. I attribute most of its badness to the host. He is incredibly annoying and seems to know little more about history or culture than the average teenager. And he's your guide. What does that say about the producers of this series?

What little credibility this series had was then flushed down the toilet by the action-movie music that accompanies the host's break-neck race through various caverns and tunnels. With his pace, and that soundtrack, there is little time for reflection and less for analysis.",1230076800,9,576,4.877551020408164
2892822,4,B000T28PG0,"This has proven to be a very interesting TV show, but it lacks a lot of detail about any of the locations. It seems to be rushed.",1225324800,4,129,3.814814814814815

8207432,5,B000T28PG0,The Don Wildman seasons are simply the best thing History channel ever did. I really miss this show!!!,1446422400,,102,4.722222222222222

8207434,5,B000T28PG0,"Glad they changed the host, the 2nd (and enduring) host of the show was infinitely better. We love this show so much and wish that it was still on!! Each episode is packed with such great history and awe, as he goes to places around the world ""underground."" The only thing that I don't like is the theme song! :) Everything else is great, each show is so great. We can't even pick a favorite and enjoy watching them over again with others!",1424304000,,439,4.301204819277109
8207435,4,B000T28PG0,Interesting series but the host's over the top enthusiasm gets a bit tiresome - less hype would improve the viewing experience - must be an American thing. Probably better with the volume set lower.,1419552000,,198,4.852941176470588

8207438,5,B000T28PG0,"This account of EDINBURGH'S  Underground Vaults is so incredible.  .  .what an Amazing City and her history is something that could partially come out of Robert Louis Stevenson's and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fervent imaginations.
DVD arrived on time and perfect condition!  Thanks so much.",1400198400,,289,5.355555555555555
