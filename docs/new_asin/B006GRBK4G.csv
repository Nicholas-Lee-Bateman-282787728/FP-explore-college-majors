4987246,5,B006GRBK4G,"Definitely a must watch movie for the true MotoGP fan.  I got to meet the director Mark Neale at a showing of the film at Pro Italia in Glendale, CA.  He is a truly modest and very talented man who gets to meet, film and tell stories of the living legends we'd all like to have a chance to talk with as he did.  The personalities of the riders really all come to life right in front of you and the race footage puts it all into perspective.  Mr. Neale is currently out gathering funds for his next film, so purchasing this DVD will help us all see another movie from him sooner than later.  Pony up some cash for this DVD, you will not be disapointed!  I certainly wasn't...",1327536000,,674,4.1461538461538465
4987247,5,B006GRBK4G,"Im a die hard MotoGP fan and have many, many DVD's this newest ""Fastest"" is part of the faster/Doctor ,tornado,kentucky kid series. I enjoyed this new movie very much but wish i would have waited a little while for it to go on sale. Dont get me wrong its evey bit as good as the first two movies and i have no complaint on content, but its not a barn burner movie that you must add to your collection today, you can wait for a sale and pick it up later and be just as happy.",1327449600,,474,3.9479166666666665
4987248,5,B006GRBK4G,"Fabulous!  I have been following Motogp for about 10 years.  I ride track days on my R6.  This video really captures what it feels like to be around motorcycle racing and into the lives of those who race.  The commentary and cinematography are excellent!  The movie is mostly about Rossi, but you can't blame them...",1327104000,,316,4.672727272727273
4987249,5,B006GRBK4G,"...you will really enjoy this movie.

The storytelling is very well done although it does hop around a bit (maybe to make you watch it twice ;-)  ).  The most appeal for me is the access that Mark Neale has to the MotoGP riders and letting them talk casually about various races, their friends/competitors and riding in general.

I don't watch MotoGP religiously, but when I record the races off the SpeedHD channel the focus is almost entirely on American riders, however they simply aren't the best riders on the track currently.  ""Fastest"" has interviews with *ALL* of the top riders (Americans included - don't worry) and you get a good sense of their attitude and amazingly friendly nature.

On top of the dramatic story of the 2010 racing season is some of the racing footage shown.  What really captivated me were several shots of the bikes in super-slow motion where you can see the riders and their machines turning, bumping, bouncing, flexing, skidding, hopping, and you really get a better understanding just how insanely fast and close to the edge of control they have to push themselves and their bikes to be competitive in this age of MC riding.  My respect for all of these guys has magnified considerably and made me more interested in MotoGP as a sport (I even think it makes me a faster rider!  Ha ha!  Just kidding - I'm still slow!)",1326585600,,1352,4.666666666666667
4987250,5,B006GRBK4G,"The family enjoyed watching Fastest. It was filled with fun clips of the riders and lots of action from the 2010 season. If you like MotoGP, it is a good movie.",1326499200,,160,4.193548387096774
4987251,5,B006GRBK4G,ThaT's the best movie concerning race bike so far! Fastest is the logical suite for faster! We see the Master Rossi as  the best rider and he is!!Sorry for my Poor English!! I'm french Canadian!,1326499200,,194,4.542857142857143
4987252,5,B006GRBK4G,"Great film. . . most recent in the available MotoGP documentaries.  Good footage and behind the scenes.  If you buy this, I recommend two additional purchases and watching ""Faster"", then ""The Doctor, the Tornado, and the Ketucky Kid"", and end your marathon with Fastest.  As a Simoncelli fan devastated by his death in October 2011. . .this was a great film.  It was early in his MotoGP career, so he is not in the film as much as I would have liked, but enough it brought a smile to my face and a tear to my eye for a fan who misses him!",1324944000,5,538,4.194174757281553
4987253,5,B006GRBK4G,"This picks up where Mark Neale left us in ""Faster"", his panoramic story of the MotoGp era from 2001 to 2002. The film mainly focuses on the 2008 to 2010 seasons. Despite the cover, Rossi on the malevolent Ducati, the 2011 season is barley mentioned.

But what a story. This is motorcycle racing in its glory days. Most of the narrative is around Valentino Rossi, one of the greatest sportsmen of our time and unequivocally one of the best there has even been in the premier class. The basic story, his move to Yamaha, quick dispatch of Biaggi, Gibernau and up to 2010, of the new pretenders is expertly told through interviews with riders, the eloquent Michael Scott, ebullient Julian Ryder and the proto-Nietzschean philosophy of Dr Costa. Along the way, we get insights from the always effacing Colin Edwards, a surprisingly mature Jorge Lorenzo, taciturn Stoner and from the up and coming Marco Simoncelli, who's sadly premature death gives the film a very touching aura.

The action shots are stunning. We see bike control around switchbacks, chicanes, slide saves and we learn about the physics of 1000 tires, breaking at 1.6G and the dead on accuracy of Rossi at Lap 1 and Lap 25 in practice. The Mugello crash, which allowed the field to rearrange itself in Rossi's absence, is given the importance it deserves.

The movie is really Rossi but all the better for it. Neale is clearly impressed and delighted by the rider community but he makes no bones that the Rossi phenomenon is likely to be stopped by injury one day and he has caught it at its very best.

If you liked On Any Sunday, Dust to Glory, Faster, then this for you. If you need waking up after a slouch Christmas dinner, then this is a must...for all the family. Also some great bonuses, especially the Red Neck/Real physics section.",1322956800,34,1804,4.699367088607595

But has  an average horsepower of about 200 HP machines and these motorcycles goes to the speeds in excess of 210 MPH! It also let's you in on how does a person compete and on what he goes through to get himself ready for it...the passion the dramas the rivalries of his fellow riders goes elbow to elbow with him on every corners chicanes at more than a 100 MPH their motorcycles are so low on the ground that they're dragging their knees to gauge their angle of attack to feel it! Just about anyone could ride a motorcycle at some certain speeds but not an excess of 200 MPH! To me, this is plain nothing short of committing suicide and i TOO ride a motorcycle but not close as these guys! You may call it brave or just plain Insane or Crazy but these guys are for real and besides not everyone has the kind of talent that these guys possess.

4987353,4,B006GRBK4G,"Firstly, I'm a MotoGP junkie, so I'm apt to like anything on that topic.

But, I especially liked the approach of this movie.

It's all about the changing of the guard and the efforts of those who were fastest to stay that way and of those who want to become fastest.

I always like when riders are presented as true ""thinking"" people and in the interviews this movie does that well.  I especially liked the interviews with the Yamaha engineer and Rossi in which they describe the difficulty of modeling the behavior of a racing motorcycle and its rider.

I thought there was a little too much coverage of racing injuries, but I suppose that in the context of trying to be ""fastest"" it's not inappropriate.",1389139200,,706,4.571428571428571

Following the ups and downs, particularly the injuries and struggles of many racers, this film does a fantastic job of showing the fan (new or old) what MOTOGP racing is all about.

With special focus on MotoGP's biggest riders, the film showcases the battle between teammates Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo. Unique insight into the powerful and dramatic racing matchup of the world's greatest riders, is just part of what makes this film great to watch.

Ewan does a great job of narrating the film just as in Faster, and the cinematic value is awesome. As with any great Motorsport film, you will want some decent speakers to hear these incredible machines at 200+ mph.

The main difference between the two is the focus on GP Moto's golden boy, Valentino Rossi, which is to say not a bad thing.  However, instead of canvasing the entirety of the GP Moto sport, it boils down to the story of one rider's goal to win back the crown after reaching his nadir.

In hindsight, I think the production crew would have been better off asking Ewan McGregor to narrate a piece on the Isle of Man TT instead.

Pros:
-still covers the excitement of Moto GP
-race footage seems so clear

Cons:
-so many other teams and riders take the backseat to the Lorenzo/Rossi rivalry
-not much for special features",1359244800,,706,4.484375

Producer Mark Neale does no real race track filming himself for the movie, but actually compiled all the footage for these MotoGP documentaries from his access to Dorna TV broadcast coverage. Some of it will be new to American viewers who do not get to see the all Pre Race, Practice and Grid Walk TV coverage that European viewers do see. Including one segment where Valentino Rossi drives his rental car around the Mugello GP track and takes about racing there, which is probably the highlight of Fastest.  But most of it is just rehashed TV race coverage that is rewound and played in slow motion to show and repeat the crashes and slides. Which we can do at home with the race broadcast on TiVo. Really disappointing was when Neale did take a video camera to Rossi's home village and interviewed some of the locals about their hometown hero, which anyone could have down, and it was frankly boring. I wanted to be taken into Rossi's private world and home on and off the race track, to show us what the man is really like with his friends, to see his house, his cars and bikes, and talk about his personal life - all of which has never been done before. I saw Faster and Fastest at free screenings with Neale and actually kept falling asleep they were so boring and poorly produced, and I had no interest in buying them to see again.",1353542400,,1671,5.1208791208791204

4987420,5,B006GRBK4G,"""Fastest"" is a documentary on Valentino Rossi in MotoGP.  The whole story revolves around him, as the world of motorcycle racing revolves around him, so it's fitting.  The whole production fit together and progressed better than Faster did, mainly because it was focused on the rise of the GOAT, then his bumbs in 06 and 07, his return to dominance in 08 and 09, and his struggle in 10 with Lorenzo and injury.  The film expressed the feelings of Lorenzo, that while he may have been given a proven bike that Rossi developed, he was still faster on it then Rossi on a few occasions.  In all, it is a great lesson in the history of man and empires.  They rise, shine for a while and then fade into history, it's just that some burn brighter and longer than the rest.  Rossi is one of those.  But, like Ewan said, in the intro and conclusion of the movie, It doesn't matter who was faster then, what matters who is Fastest now.  The question the world wants to know, does Rossi still have it?  ""Fastest"" sets the stage for Rossi and his return to Yamaha.  God speed Rossi!",1352419200,,1070,4.385786802030457
4987421,5,B006GRBK4G,"While not as informative about the sport as Faster was it has some great video and commentary. Like Faster it seems to be mostly about Rossi, but if you were going to make a motoGP video why wouldn't you. As a Dani Pedrosa fan I felt a little let down with how much they showed about him.",1351814400,,288,4.0701754385964914
4987422,5,B006GRBK4G,"Ok I'm a real bike racing fanatic and have all Mark Neale's works, but that doesn't matter as this is a great sport movie for the uninitiated anyway.  Brilliant action with beautiful footage that will appeal to anyone that can appreciate the skill of the world's greatest racers.  Ewan McGregor is the ideal narrator yet again.  This is a highly recommended movie for anyone wanting to understand more about the current crop of talent at the pinnacle of motorcycle racing.",1351641600,,472,4.875
4987423,5,B006GRBK4G,Great follow up to the first movie!! Tons of action. If you're a motoGP FAN THIS IS A MUST!!! Watch it now.,1348185600,,107,3.909090909090909
4987424,5,B006GRBK4G,"The video is exactly what it says in the description. It covers a great deal of the 2010 MotoGP season and interviews a number of riders. It highlights a lot of the 2010 race action, but also goes back into previous seasons to reflect on some of Rossi's battles with current and former rivals. There is also a brief interview with Masao Furusawa. I do wish there was a little more with him though, and other engineers.",1347148800,,418,4.441558441558442
4987425,4,B006GRBK4G,"If you're a Valentino Rossi fan you'll love this video, as a good portion of it is his biography.  If you're not a VR fan, the rest of the video is still pretty good too.  Maybe not quite as good as ""Faster"", it's still a very entertaining look at MotoGP.",1346025600,,255,4.08
4987426,4,B006GRBK4G,This is the fourth installment of the series pertaining to the Motorcycle Grand Prix racing. The movie is basic enough that my wife can easily follow along while I remain enthralled every time I watch the movie. Yet I know there is more information that can be included in the DVD.,1345852800,,281,4.529411764705882
4987427,3,B006GRBK4G,"This DVD content was just 'ok'.  I've seen the other films, and this one does not do anything groundbreaking.  Seemed to be more like a recap of the motoGP season if anything.  Could have been better by doing more behind the scenes and bike prep etc... or even spending some time with the riders in their personal lives.  I suppose if you're a diehard motogp fan, then this would be the next logical DVD to watch...",1345161600,,415,4.421052631578948
4987428,5,B006GRBK4G,"I originally bought this DVD for my husband, but I ended up liking it as much as he did. Kept my interest & I learned a lot about motorcycle racing I didn't know about.",1344556800,,168,3.9705882352941178
4987429,5,B006GRBK4G,"In full disclosure, I am a TT fan first and MotoGP second.  That being said, Fastest is the best of the three films in this trilogy.  The cinematography was phenomenal.  The breadth of their coverage of the sport in recent times was very good.  Interviews with riders and fans was quite good too.  If you don't like Rossi, you won't like this film. Much of the film focuses on his accomplishment and his personality.  I really liked the soundtrack as well.  My brother-in-law, who has little to no interest in motorcycles was transfixed by the footage and stopped what he was doing and sat with me to watch most of this fine film.

The theme of this film concerns the level of perfection that is needed to win in this sport and the amount of danger that still exists. It focuses on the the amount of dedication that riders like Rossi, Lorenzo and Stoner have needed in order to succeed in the sport.  The extra features are forgettable but the main event is good enough to give this five stars.  If you love MotoGP, you must see this film.  You will enjoy the footage even if you just have a casual interest in motorcycle racing.",1341705600,,1129,4.458536585365854
4987430,4,B006GRBK4G,"There is no doubt that Valentino Rossi is the Greatest Champion in the history of the sport. I was dissapointed that some of the on-line trailer footage wasn't integrated into the final version and I would have enjoyed more footage of other Riders thoughts and struggles. Faster still holds the top spot in my heart, but I would recommend any one of the series of 3 movies for an in depth intro to the sport, or as just flat-out entertainment. Many Thanks to the Racers, the FIM and especially the Crew of ""Fastest"".

Anyone who thinks this movie is boring just ain't living!",1330041600,,247,4.276595744680851
4987432,4,B006GRBK4G,"This was a visually stimulating dvd that delivered in many aspects.  However, if you're not a huge ""Vale"" fan, it may be a bit disappointing, if not irritating.  I must say, for full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of the ""G.O.A.T"", Valentino Rossi!  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is a true fan of the greatest sport in the world, motorcycle road racing!",1329523200,,361,4.523076923076923
4987433,1,B006GRBK4G,"Much to my regret, I believed the previous reviews...and made a huge error by buying this ""Moped"" of a documentary.
I suppose that the people who stand to enrich themselves by the sales of this DVD, fancied that they wouldn't trick many actual racers, or knowledgeable fans of same, into parting with $...so they tailored it to the girlies & gays who have ""a thing"" going for Rossi...for which this is a overly-worshipful tribute.
Oh, the photography is not all that great, either...although, albeit, it is an improvement on the first one, ""FASTER.""",1328572800,2,549,4.913978494623656
